00:00.000 --> 00:08.500
The whole gamergate 2 thing came about when Sargon brought up on the killstream how hilarious it would be if Trump tweeted about gamergate, years after it was done.

00:08.500 --> 00:15.000
Of course, because the crowd, or should I say, the cowd, that orbited the killstream back then were a bunch of spurgs,

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
they all thought that Sargon's been living in the past for years now, pining away for the good old days of gamergate, hoping for it to make a return.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.500
There are a few people from gamergate like that out there, who wish that it was still 2014, but I don't think Sargon's one of them.

00:26.500 --> 00:31.500
The point he was making, as far as I can tell, is that to the twitter verified crowd, gamergate was their Vietnam.

00:31.500 --> 00:35.500
Most of us who were pro gamergate back in the day rarely talk about it anymore. It's over.

00:35.500 --> 00:40.500
But social justice journalists keep trotting the corpse of gamergate out whenever they need a boogeyman to pin something on.

00:40.500 --> 00:50.500
Or, more commonly, whenever they need to rile up their base by inducing PTSD flashbacks about that one time the commoners were able to actually oppose them in the cultural sphere.

00:50.500 --> 00:58.500
The conservative wing of politics basically abandoned pop culture 50 years ago, to their own detriment because politics is downstream from culture.

00:58.500 --> 01:07.500
And it's only been in the past decade, and even then only sparingly, that we've seen cultural works revolve around conservation rather than liberation as their central theme.

01:07.500 --> 01:17.500
Here's just one example. It's no surprise to me that Game of Thrones, Attack on Titan, and Fallout 4 all prominently featured spirituality projected onto a huge protective wall,

01:17.500 --> 01:22.500
and that they all came into the zeitgeist during the rise of the alt-right. I'm not saying that media shapes the politics of the people.

01:22.500 --> 01:27.500
It can, if it's an ending propaganda, but that's not what this is. This is more like the politics of the people shaping the media.

01:27.500 --> 01:33.500
But here's my point. When the conservatives abandoned pop culture, pop culture became the domain of the center left and the radical left.

01:33.500 --> 01:39.500
The radical left, being radicals, went to war with the center left, and slowly began to eject them from the Overton window.

01:39.500 --> 01:45.500
This is why Hollywood's always been more left than the rest of the states. This eventually filtered down into the rest of society through prolonged media exposure.

01:45.500 --> 01:49.500
And it was relatively easy for things to quietly and slowly shift over time.

01:49.500 --> 01:53.500
Without the balancing force of conservatism, academia was easy to radicalize.

01:53.500 --> 01:57.500
The academic is, by their very nature, a force for liberation rather than conservation.

01:57.500 --> 02:01.500
They want to discover the unknown and bring it into balance, hopefully for the good of society.

02:01.500 --> 02:05.500
This is also why radical governments of both stripes slaughter academics when they come to power.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.500
They're the ones who are most likely to discover all the ways in which the government's wrong.

02:09.500 --> 02:15.500
Journalism was also quite easy to radicalize. The journalist is, by their very nature, a truth seeker, a stone turner.

02:15.500 --> 02:19.500
They also want to liberate rather than conserve, this time truth instead of pure knowledge.

02:19.500 --> 02:25.500
I'm sure, in their own demented way, even pipsqueaks like Carlos Maza view themselves as speaking truth to the great orange power.

02:25.500 --> 02:31.500
It's the same with movies and TV, business and governments. In nearly every area of society, HR departments had a field day.

02:31.500 --> 02:37.500
There were only two cultural domains that the radical left had a natural disadvantage in. Sports and video games.

02:37.500 --> 02:40.500
And it's not hard to see why. Both revolve around competition.

02:40.500 --> 02:45.500
You can learn to cooperate in most areas of your life, and it's usually for your betterment to do so, because cooperation is an important skill.

02:45.500 --> 02:50.500
But some areas are strictly competitive, and in fact do not function without competition.

02:50.500 --> 02:54.500
Social justice is finally making a foothold in sports using trans ideology.

02:54.500 --> 02:59.500
Their claim is that a trans woman can spend most of their lives inundated in testosterone at levels equal to a man,

02:59.500 --> 03:04.500
then identify as a woman, transition, take some estrogen which will decrease their strength,

03:04.500 --> 03:08.500
but not nearly enough to counter a decade or more of what is basically steroid doping,

03:08.500 --> 03:11.500
and then turn around and compete with cis women in physical sports.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.500
This is why there's now the common joke, men make the best women.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.500
Well, that and traps.

03:16.500 --> 03:21.500
Because trans women are demolishing cis women in professional sports in ways that are, quite frankly, unfair.

03:21.500 --> 03:25.500
But the SJWs didn't gain their foothold in sports by trying to dismantle competitiveness.

03:25.500 --> 03:30.500
They simply changed the rule of the game so that their guys, and I'm using that word gender neutrally, would always win.

03:30.500 --> 03:35.500
It's the height of narcissism that somebody like this would hold her arms up in triumph,

03:35.500 --> 03:37.500
like she's actually the victor of anything meaningful.

03:37.500 --> 03:42.500
That's not to say that winning in women's sports isn't meaningful, but rather it's this victory that strips it of the meaning.

03:42.500 --> 03:47.500
It's just disrespectful towards the women who didn't have the advantage of testosterone-producing genitals.

03:47.500 --> 03:52.500
However, video games are the one cultural domain where the usual SJW tricks just didn't work.

03:52.500 --> 03:56.500
It worked in sports because, one, the physical ability between the genders is huge,

03:56.500 --> 04:02.500
and enforcing an everyone is equal or it's oppressive dogma onto the sport basically meant they'd always win.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.500
And two, because sports are public.

04:04.500 --> 04:08.500
Normies watch them, normies play them, normies talk about them around the water cooler at work,

04:08.500 --> 04:10.500
sports stars are idolized by normies.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.500
But video games aren't like that. They're not nearly as public an activity.

04:13.500 --> 04:17.500
Yes, I'm sure you can have some great conversations about games in the lunchroom nowadays,

04:17.500 --> 04:20.500
and that's great because when I was a kid you'd get beat up for being a gamer.

04:20.500 --> 04:24.500
But the big names in esports are speedrunning? They're not household names.

04:24.500 --> 04:28.500
Nobody puts posters of them up in their rooms, or wants to be like them when they grow up.

04:28.500 --> 04:32.500
Sure, those people can still make good money doing what they do, but it's still a largely private enterprise.

04:32.500 --> 04:36.500
I've taken the long way to get here, pals, sorry about that, but you needed the context.

04:36.500 --> 04:41.500
Gamergate is the progressive Vietnam, because when the progressives came for gaming like they had come for everything else under the sun,

04:41.500 --> 04:45.500
and the average gamer learned about it due to the incredible incompetence of Zoe Quinn,

04:45.500 --> 04:47.500
we were basically able to run them off.

04:47.500 --> 04:50.500
It was the first true defeat of social justice in the field.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.500
Yeah, there may be more SJW indies out there than ever.

04:53.500 --> 04:57.500
AAA games are sacrificing quality for politics, game journals are becoming ever more extreme,

04:57.500 --> 05:03.500
and like I said in yesterday's video, garbage business practices like the Epic Store or Games as a Service are on the rise.

05:03.500 --> 05:06.500
But all this stuff is happening in the open because we pulled the curtain back.

05:06.500 --> 05:11.500
SJW indies are desperately maintaining a crumbling, cliquey power structure

05:11.500 --> 05:16.500
against the influence of YouTubers and streamers, like myself, who are willing to just play the games they like.

05:16.500 --> 05:21.500
AAA developers that excessively misbehave end up destroying themselves, like BioWare or Blizzard.

05:21.500 --> 05:26.500
Game journals are becoming more extreme because their industry is dying and this is their final gasp.

05:26.500 --> 05:31.500
And hopefully, as time goes on, the market will speak out against the Epic Store or Games as a Service.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.500
Do your part, lads.

05:32.500 --> 05:37.500
So, when Sargon said, let's get Trump to tweet about Gamergate, he didn't actually want to start Gamergate, too.

05:37.500 --> 05:43.500
Rather, he understood that progressives would be waking up at 2am in a cold sweat if it ever happened, because they just cannot let it go.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.500
Really, think about it.

05:45.500 --> 05:48.500
Why did Patrick Klepek write, we need to get ready for gamergate politicians?

05:48.500 --> 05:51.500
Sargon's done other noteworthy things than gamergate.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.500
But for this specific crowd, gamergate is the sticking point.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.500
It's the battle scar that still aches.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.500
It's the Jerusalem they failed to hold on their crusade.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.500
What is gamergate and why parents should know?

06:01.500 --> 06:03.500
You're about five years too late, man.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.500
It's over. Nobody's talking about it anymore.

06:05.500 --> 06:11.500
But if you search gamergate on Google News and limit it to the past few months, you'll still unearth a massive pile of articles.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.500
They just can't let it go.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.500
There's been a few things that felt like the sparkings of a new gamergate.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.500
The stuff in my MasterCard video last year, maybe.

06:17.500 --> 06:25.500
The Patreon purge, where Sargon was unjustly removed from Patreon, and their official rationale on the topic basically amounted to them tripping over their own two feet.

06:25.500 --> 06:37.500
The Adpocalypse, where Carlos Maza's retaliation against Steven Crowder for some frankly pretty lame jokes led to the demonetization of thousands of channels, including channels not even remotely involved in the controversy.

06:37.500 --> 06:40.500
And hell, there's a new event right now that could even be another gamergate-sized event.

06:40.500 --> 06:44.500
Facebook plans global financial system based on cryptocurrency.

06:44.500 --> 06:52.500
Facebook unveiled an ambitious plan on Tuesday to create an alternative financial system that relies on a cryptocurrency that the company has been secretly working on for more than a year.

06:52.500 --> 07:03.500
The effort, announced with 27 partners as diverse as MasterCard and Uber, could face immediate skepticism from people who question the usefulness of cryptocurrencies, and others who are wary of the power already accumulated by the social media company.

07:03.500 --> 07:13.500
The currency, called Libra, will also have to overcome concerns that Facebook does not effectively protect the private information of its users, a fundamental task for a bank or anyone handling financial transactions.

07:13.500 --> 07:18.500
You know, I don't trust Facebook with anything. I certainly don't trust them to be a global bank.

07:18.500 --> 07:23.500
Big tech is looking to monopolize every single sector of your life, not just the online speech domain.

07:23.500 --> 07:28.500
Oh, and also, the 27 partners also include PayPal and Visa, not just MasterCard.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.500
So there's a chance we're all just screwed.

07:30.500 --> 07:37.500
But my point is, all of these felt like gamergate-sized events, but never seemed to generate the massive online cultural shift that gamergate did.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.500
Maybe it's because you could only have the scales fall from your eyes once, you know?

07:40.500 --> 07:45.500
Before gamergate, my channel was anime and video games. I still do that stuff on alternate channels.

07:45.500 --> 07:52.500
But now I talk politics here because I feel like, even with my microscopic reach, it's still some contribution to the discussion.

07:52.500 --> 07:56.500
Gamergate felt like the betrayal of an enthusiast press that I thought had my back.

07:56.500 --> 08:01.500
And as a result, I realized I had to be a lot less lazy when it came to interacting with the wider gaming culture.

08:01.500 --> 08:07.500
I couldn't just blanket trust anymore that the people in the industry, whatever that meant, were properly doing their jobs.

08:07.500 --> 08:16.500
But I also met a ton of great people who I do trust are doing their jobs, from YouTubers to streamers to let's players to indie devs to journalists themselves, people I would never have known about otherwise.

08:16.500 --> 08:26.500
And as vitally important as the Patreon purge, or the Vox Adpocalypse, or Facebook creating the New World Order is, they'll never be gamergate 2 because it was never about gamergate 2.

08:26.500 --> 08:30.500
Gamergate was where we cut our teeth. I don't think things will ever blow up like that again.

08:30.500 --> 08:34.500
But I also don't think they ever need to again. At least, not until the next generation comes up.

08:34.500 --> 08:40.500
We're more alert now. We're smarter now. We're more informed now. We're less likely to swallow people's BS.

08:40.500 --> 08:45.500
And now that we're actually present, we've got some exceptionally tough problems to solve.

08:45.500 --> 08:46.500
Let's solve them.
