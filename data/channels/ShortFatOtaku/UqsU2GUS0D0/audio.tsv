0	8500	The whole gamergate 2 thing came about when Sargon brought up on the killstream how hilarious it would be if Trump tweeted about gamergate, years after it was done.
8500	15000	Of course, because the crowd, or should I say, the cowd, that orbited the killstream back then were a bunch of spurgs,
15000	21000	they all thought that Sargon's been living in the past for years now, pining away for the good old days of gamergate, hoping for it to make a return.
21000	26500	There are a few people from gamergate like that out there, who wish that it was still 2014, but I don't think Sargon's one of them.
26500	31500	The point he was making, as far as I can tell, is that to the twitter verified crowd, gamergate was their Vietnam.
31500	35500	Most of us who were pro gamergate back in the day rarely talk about it anymore. It's over.
35500	40500	But social justice journalists keep trotting the corpse of gamergate out whenever they need a boogeyman to pin something on.
40500	50500	Or, more commonly, whenever they need to rile up their base by inducing PTSD flashbacks about that one time the commoners were able to actually oppose them in the cultural sphere.
50500	58500	The conservative wing of politics basically abandoned pop culture 50 years ago, to their own detriment because politics is downstream from culture.
58500	67500	And it's only been in the past decade, and even then only sparingly, that we've seen cultural works revolve around conservation rather than liberation as their central theme.
67500	77500	Here's just one example. It's no surprise to me that Game of Thrones, Attack on Titan, and Fallout 4 all prominently featured spirituality projected onto a huge protective wall,
77500	82500	and that they all came into the zeitgeist during the rise of the alt-right. I'm not saying that media shapes the politics of the people.
82500	87500	It can, if it's an ending propaganda, but that's not what this is. This is more like the politics of the people shaping the media.
87500	93500	But here's my point. When the conservatives abandoned pop culture, pop culture became the domain of the center left and the radical left.
93500	99500	The radical left, being radicals, went to war with the center left, and slowly began to eject them from the Overton window.
99500	105500	This is why Hollywood's always been more left than the rest of the states. This eventually filtered down into the rest of society through prolonged media exposure.
105500	109500	And it was relatively easy for things to quietly and slowly shift over time.
109500	113500	Without the balancing force of conservatism, academia was easy to radicalize.
113500	117500	The academic is, by their very nature, a force for liberation rather than conservation.
117500	121500	They want to discover the unknown and bring it into balance, hopefully for the good of society.
121500	125500	This is also why radical governments of both stripes slaughter academics when they come to power.
125500	128500	They're the ones who are most likely to discover all the ways in which the government's wrong.
129500	135500	Journalism was also quite easy to radicalize. The journalist is, by their very nature, a truth seeker, a stone turner.
135500	139500	They also want to liberate rather than conserve, this time truth instead of pure knowledge.
139500	145500	I'm sure, in their own demented way, even pipsqueaks like Carlos Maza view themselves as speaking truth to the great orange power.
145500	151500	It's the same with movies and TV, business and governments. In nearly every area of society, HR departments had a field day.
151500	157500	There were only two cultural domains that the radical left had a natural disadvantage in. Sports and video games.
157500	160500	And it's not hard to see why. Both revolve around competition.
160500	165500	You can learn to cooperate in most areas of your life, and it's usually for your betterment to do so, because cooperation is an important skill.
165500	170500	But some areas are strictly competitive, and in fact do not function without competition.
170500	174500	Social justice is finally making a foothold in sports using trans ideology.
174500	179500	Their claim is that a trans woman can spend most of their lives inundated in testosterone at levels equal to a man,
179500	184500	then identify as a woman, transition, take some estrogen which will decrease their strength,
184500	188500	but not nearly enough to counter a decade or more of what is basically steroid doping,
188500	191500	and then turn around and compete with cis women in physical sports.
191500	194500	This is why there's now the common joke, men make the best women.
194500	196500	Well, that and traps.
196500	201500	Because trans women are demolishing cis women in professional sports in ways that are, quite frankly, unfair.
201500	205500	But the SJWs didn't gain their foothold in sports by trying to dismantle competitiveness.
205500	210500	They simply changed the rule of the game so that their guys, and I'm using that word gender neutrally, would always win.
210500	215500	It's the height of narcissism that somebody like this would hold her arms up in triumph,
215500	217500	like she's actually the victor of anything meaningful.
217500	222500	That's not to say that winning in women's sports isn't meaningful, but rather it's this victory that strips it of the meaning.
222500	227500	It's just disrespectful towards the women who didn't have the advantage of testosterone-producing genitals.
227500	232500	However, video games are the one cultural domain where the usual SJW tricks just didn't work.
232500	236500	It worked in sports because, one, the physical ability between the genders is huge,
236500	242500	and enforcing an everyone is equal or it's oppressive dogma onto the sport basically meant they'd always win.
242500	244500	And two, because sports are public.
244500	248500	Normies watch them, normies play them, normies talk about them around the water cooler at work,
248500	250500	sports stars are idolized by normies.
250500	253500	But video games aren't like that. They're not nearly as public an activity.
253500	257500	Yes, I'm sure you can have some great conversations about games in the lunchroom nowadays,
257500	260500	and that's great because when I was a kid you'd get beat up for being a gamer.
260500	264500	But the big names in esports are speedrunning? They're not household names.
264500	268500	Nobody puts posters of them up in their rooms, or wants to be like them when they grow up.
268500	272500	Sure, those people can still make good money doing what they do, but it's still a largely private enterprise.
272500	276500	I've taken the long way to get here, pals, sorry about that, but you needed the context.
276500	281500	Gamergate is the progressive Vietnam, because when the progressives came for gaming like they had come for everything else under the sun,
281500	285500	and the average gamer learned about it due to the incredible incompetence of Zoe Quinn,
285500	287500	we were basically able to run them off.
287500	290500	It was the first true defeat of social justice in the field.
290500	293500	Yeah, there may be more SJW indies out there than ever.
293500	297500	AAA games are sacrificing quality for politics, game journals are becoming ever more extreme,
297500	303500	and like I said in yesterday's video, garbage business practices like the Epic Store or Games as a Service are on the rise.
303500	306500	But all this stuff is happening in the open because we pulled the curtain back.
306500	311500	SJW indies are desperately maintaining a crumbling, cliquey power structure
311500	316500	against the influence of YouTubers and streamers, like myself, who are willing to just play the games they like.
316500	321500	AAA developers that excessively misbehave end up destroying themselves, like BioWare or Blizzard.
321500	326500	Game journals are becoming more extreme because their industry is dying and this is their final gasp.
326500	331500	And hopefully, as time goes on, the market will speak out against the Epic Store or Games as a Service.
331500	332500	Do your part, lads.
332500	337500	So, when Sargon said, let's get Trump to tweet about Gamergate, he didn't actually want to start Gamergate, too.
337500	343500	Rather, he understood that progressives would be waking up at 2am in a cold sweat if it ever happened, because they just cannot let it go.
343500	345500	Really, think about it.
345500	348500	Why did Patrick Klepek write, we need to get ready for gamergate politicians?
348500	351500	Sargon's done other noteworthy things than gamergate.
351500	354500	But for this specific crowd, gamergate is the sticking point.
354500	356500	It's the battle scar that still aches.
356500	358500	It's the Jerusalem they failed to hold on their crusade.
358500	361500	What is gamergate and why parents should know?
361500	363500	You're about five years too late, man.
363500	365500	It's over. Nobody's talking about it anymore.
365500	371500	But if you search gamergate on Google News and limit it to the past few months, you'll still unearth a massive pile of articles.
371500	372500	They just can't let it go.
372500	375500	There's been a few things that felt like the sparkings of a new gamergate.
375500	377500	The stuff in my MasterCard video last year, maybe.
377500	385500	The Patreon purge, where Sargon was unjustly removed from Patreon, and their official rationale on the topic basically amounted to them tripping over their own two feet.
385500	397500	The Adpocalypse, where Carlos Maza's retaliation against Steven Crowder for some frankly pretty lame jokes led to the demonetization of thousands of channels, including channels not even remotely involved in the controversy.
397500	400500	And hell, there's a new event right now that could even be another gamergate-sized event.
400500	404500	Facebook plans global financial system based on cryptocurrency.
404500	412500	Facebook unveiled an ambitious plan on Tuesday to create an alternative financial system that relies on a cryptocurrency that the company has been secretly working on for more than a year.
412500	423500	The effort, announced with 27 partners as diverse as MasterCard and Uber, could face immediate skepticism from people who question the usefulness of cryptocurrencies, and others who are wary of the power already accumulated by the social media company.
423500	433500	The currency, called Libra, will also have to overcome concerns that Facebook does not effectively protect the private information of its users, a fundamental task for a bank or anyone handling financial transactions.
433500	438500	You know, I don't trust Facebook with anything. I certainly don't trust them to be a global bank.
438500	443500	Big tech is looking to monopolize every single sector of your life, not just the online speech domain.
443500	448500	Oh, and also, the 27 partners also include PayPal and Visa, not just MasterCard.
448500	450500	So there's a chance we're all just screwed.
450500	457500	But my point is, all of these felt like gamergate-sized events, but never seemed to generate the massive online cultural shift that gamergate did.
457500	460500	Maybe it's because you could only have the scales fall from your eyes once, you know?
460500	465500	Before gamergate, my channel was anime and video games. I still do that stuff on alternate channels.
465500	472500	But now I talk politics here because I feel like, even with my microscopic reach, it's still some contribution to the discussion.
472500	476500	Gamergate felt like the betrayal of an enthusiast press that I thought had my back.
476500	481500	And as a result, I realized I had to be a lot less lazy when it came to interacting with the wider gaming culture.
481500	487500	I couldn't just blanket trust anymore that the people in the industry, whatever that meant, were properly doing their jobs.
487500	496500	But I also met a ton of great people who I do trust are doing their jobs, from YouTubers to streamers to let's players to indie devs to journalists themselves, people I would never have known about otherwise.
496500	506500	And as vitally important as the Patreon purge, or the Vox Adpocalypse, or Facebook creating the New World Order is, they'll never be gamergate 2 because it was never about gamergate 2.
506500	510500	Gamergate was where we cut our teeth. I don't think things will ever blow up like that again.
510500	514500	But I also don't think they ever need to again. At least, not until the next generation comes up.
514500	520500	We're more alert now. We're smarter now. We're more informed now. We're less likely to swallow people's BS.
520500	525500	And now that we're actually present, we've got some exceptionally tough problems to solve.
525500	526500	Let's solve them.
