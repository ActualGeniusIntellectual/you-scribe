00:00.000 --> 00:10.480
When Rush Limbaugh was first rising to prominence, he started a trend among conservatives that

00:10.480 --> 00:14.280
continues to this day, of conflating socialists with liberals.

00:14.280 --> 00:17.540
I don't know if he actually believed that they were the same thing, but for the sake

00:17.540 --> 00:21.620
of argument, let's assume that he wasn't that stupid and he was just being hyperbolic.

00:21.620 --> 00:26.420
It's clear to anybody with a brain that the free speech, free market, rights and individualism

00:26.420 --> 00:31.020
of liberalism is not the same thing as the proletariat revolution, communal ownership,

00:31.020 --> 00:34.000
historic materialism and collectivism of socialism.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.600
But to conflate a legitimate yet marginalized evil with those people who are, in the grand

00:38.600 --> 00:42.700
scheme of things, just slightly to the left of you but constitute your largest opponent,

00:42.700 --> 00:44.280
rhetorically makes a lot of sense.

00:44.280 --> 00:46.180
The problem is, it isn't true.

00:46.180 --> 00:50.980
And yet you see a lot of conservatives doing it to this day, from old style Fox News talking

00:50.980 --> 00:54.380
heads to conservative and libertarian YouTubers.

00:54.380 --> 00:57.060
Something's about all the bad stuff the libs are doing.

00:57.060 --> 01:01.340
In the past couple of years, the socialists have tried to pull a similar linguistic sigh

01:01.340 --> 01:02.340
off.

01:02.340 --> 01:05.700
I'm sure you've noticed recently that all of the regressive lefty garbage that nearly

01:05.700 --> 01:09.460
everybody hates is slowly being defined out of the left.

01:09.460 --> 01:15.160
The feminists, the SJWs, the race grifters, they're no longer leftists but libs, or less

01:15.160 --> 01:16.780
commonly rad libs.

01:16.780 --> 01:20.860
And the TERFs, don't get me started on the TERFs, they've been redefined as right wing.

01:20.860 --> 01:25.040
Which is ridiculous because TERFs are still feminists and there's no feminism on the right.

01:25.040 --> 01:29.780
The idea is, though, that if the left is the only political tent that houses legitimate

01:29.780 --> 01:34.160
progress, and the socialists wholeheartedly believe that to be the case, then all of that

01:34.160 --> 01:37.220
regressive lefty garbage simply isn't lefty at all.

01:37.220 --> 01:40.600
This idea is, of course, nonsense on the face of it.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.900
Identity politics is not a toolkit in the classical liberal's belt.

01:43.900 --> 01:48.660
It may be in the neo-liberals, but not out of any kind of racial or gender solidarity,

01:48.660 --> 01:51.500
rather it's for exploitation and masking as representation.

01:51.500 --> 01:55.020
And yes, that is very similar to the idpol of the left.

01:55.020 --> 01:58.660
But the classical liberal position, not the conservative position or whatever else you

01:58.660 --> 02:03.680
may take that statement to mean, I mean the original liberal position, the Lockean position,

02:03.680 --> 02:05.560
is fundamentally colorblindness.

02:05.560 --> 02:10.500
It is free speech, free markets, fairness before the eyes of the law, property and self-determination.

02:10.500 --> 02:13.980
And before you say that the original liberal governments of the enlightenment weren't

02:13.980 --> 02:15.880
this ideal, yes, I agree.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.940
The problem with those is that they're not liberal enough.

02:17.940 --> 02:20.640
The problem with our current governments is that they're not liberal enough.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.800
The wordplay landscape looks a little something like this.

02:23.800 --> 02:27.820
People on the right are incorrectly calling people on the left liberals.

02:27.820 --> 02:32.040
And people on the left are also incorrectly calling other people on the left, those people

02:32.040 --> 02:34.820
whom they specifically disapprove of, liberals.

02:34.820 --> 02:38.980
Funnily enough, both the left and the right have recognized a cancerous growth within

02:38.980 --> 02:39.980
the left.

02:39.980 --> 02:45.420
But the right purposefully misidentified it for short-term rhetorical gain, with disastrous

02:45.420 --> 02:47.700
long-term consequences in my opinion.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.820
While the left would rather ignore the growing tumor entirely.

02:50.820 --> 02:51.820
What is the cancer?

02:51.820 --> 02:53.620
Well, that depends on who you ask.

02:53.620 --> 02:58.020
There are broadly two camps within the left, the socialists and the SJWs.

02:58.020 --> 03:01.120
The socialists are focused exclusively on class struggle.

03:01.120 --> 03:04.900
Some of them think Marx was correct and want to see a dictatorship of the proletariat implement

03:04.900 --> 03:08.660
the worldwide moneyless, stateless, classless, communist utopia.

03:08.660 --> 03:12.980
Some of them are market socialists, or anarcho-socialists, or libertarian socialists.

03:12.980 --> 03:14.220
It honestly doesn't matter too much.

03:14.220 --> 03:16.760
The point is that they're united by class issues.

03:16.760 --> 03:20.760
They are the no-war-but-class-war people, and they are predominantly the ones pointing

03:20.760 --> 03:25.000
at all the regressive garbage within their own camp and saying, no, that's not us, that's

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
the libs.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.660
The second camp, the SJWs, are generally what the first camp means when it points to regressive

03:31.660 --> 03:32.660
garbage.

03:32.660 --> 03:37.640
These are the Robin DeAngelos, the Jeff Tiedriches, the Emily Gorsenskys, the Tariq Nasheeds and

03:37.640 --> 03:38.800
the Shaun Kings.

03:38.800 --> 03:43.880
There is currently an attempt by the socialist left to push the idpol left out of the left,

03:43.880 --> 03:48.640
because the socialists view them as distracting from the class war with a race war, or a gender

03:48.640 --> 03:49.720
war, or a trans war.

03:49.720 --> 03:53.880
They call it performative wokeness, or they'll claim it's not real leftism, or some of their

03:53.880 --> 03:58.200
such garbage, because it's not specifically and exclusively anti-capitalist.

03:58.200 --> 04:02.240
But nonetheless, the idpol of the left, or the idpol of what these people call the rad

04:02.240 --> 04:06.000
libs, ultimately does stem from Marxist analysis.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.640
Marx's conception of the relationship between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has been

04:09.640 --> 04:14.040
co-opted for idpol analysis of other dominant and oppressed groups for probably about as

04:14.040 --> 04:15.840
long as Marxism has existed.

04:15.840 --> 04:20.380
After all, Black Lives Matter, an organization founded by a Marxist using Marxist principles

04:20.380 --> 04:24.720
in its analysis, is ultimately a radical idpol movement, and it's certainly not liberal.

04:24.720 --> 04:27.400
We actually do have an ideological frame.

04:27.400 --> 04:32.360
Myself and Alicia in particular are trained organizers.

04:32.360 --> 04:36.440
We are trained Marxists.

04:36.440 --> 04:48.160
We are super versed on sort of ideological theories, and I think that what we really

04:48.160 --> 04:53.640
try to do is build a movement that could be utilized by many, many black folk.

04:53.640 --> 04:57.320
We don't necessarily want to be the vanguard of this movement.

04:57.320 --> 05:02.620
I think we've tried to put out a political frame that's about centering who we think

05:02.620 --> 05:08.580
are the most vulnerable amongst the black community to really fight for all of our lives.

05:08.580 --> 05:14.960
Harry White, a British communist, wrote to Stalin in 1934 asking if, I quote, a homosexual

05:14.960 --> 05:18.240
can be considered someone worthy of membership in the communist party.

05:18.240 --> 05:21.760
Stalin called White an idiot and a degenerate, again a quote.

05:21.760 --> 05:27.120
And to their credit, Stalin is not well-liked amongst a segment of the online left for his

05:27.120 --> 05:28.120
authoritarianism.

05:28.120 --> 05:32.920
But regardless, White's questioning of Stalin, even back then, used the Marxist framework

05:32.920 --> 05:35.780
as a justification for his LGBT analysis.

05:35.780 --> 05:40.740
White wrote in his letter, on the whole, the condition of homosexuals under capitalism

05:40.740 --> 05:44.920
is analogous to the condition of women, the colored races, ethnic minorities, and other

05:44.920 --> 05:47.560
groups that are repressed for one reason or another.

05:47.560 --> 05:52.280
And just as the women of the bourgeois class suffer to a significantly lesser degree from

05:52.280 --> 05:57.120
the injustices of the capitalist regime, so do natural-born homosexuals of the dominant

05:57.120 --> 06:02.020
class suffer much less from persecution than homosexuals from the working class milieu.

06:02.020 --> 06:06.360
The ideas in White's letter are identical to the ideas put forward by the people whom

06:06.360 --> 06:08.520
socialists call the rad-libs.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.800
And yet these are clearly not the words of a liberal.

06:10.800 --> 06:15.800
They are the words of a socialist, using the Marxist framework to justify identity politics.

06:15.800 --> 06:20.280
The fact that White was correct, that the Stalinists were violently purging gay people

06:20.280 --> 06:25.060
in the Soviet Union, isn't relevant to the conclusion that leftist idpol cannot simply

06:25.060 --> 06:29.240
be defined out of the left, but is in fact an intrinsic part of it.

06:29.240 --> 06:32.600
Marxism is idpol, and it can never be anything but.

06:32.600 --> 06:37.480
You have to enforce an us-versus-them sort of tribalism to get any kind of workers' revolution

06:37.480 --> 06:38.480
going.

06:38.480 --> 06:43.040
And that same ethic is why, for example, Black Lives Matter exists the way that it does.

06:43.280 --> 06:48.400
It is not an organic growth of the people, but rather imposed by clever propagandists.

06:48.400 --> 06:53.880
Challenge magazine, the outlet of Britain's Young Communist League, even released a pamphlet

06:53.880 --> 06:58.120
describing how all of the regressive shit on the left was not truly leftist, but instead

06:58.120 --> 06:59.780
radical liberalism.

06:59.780 --> 07:05.040
Even though the pamphlet itself quotes Engels as saying that identity-based politics has

07:05.040 --> 07:09.300
its place within the socialist revolution, to them the first principle must be economic,

07:09.300 --> 07:13.020
as they believe solving the economic problem would largely solve all other idpol problems.

07:13.020 --> 07:17.540
The socialists don't view class as being simply another variable in the equation, but

07:17.540 --> 07:22.780
the only variable, and so the SJWs are rad libs, not true leftists, forgetting entirely

07:22.780 --> 07:26.660
that a true liberal would consider them both to be abominations, just of a different, yet

07:26.660 --> 07:27.660
related sort.

07:27.660 --> 07:32.080
And the reason for it is quite clear, yes, the SJWs are using the socialist framework

07:32.080 --> 07:35.280
to examine non-socialist issues, but that's not the only reason.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.040
Consider this black hole brain take.

07:37.040 --> 07:41.120
The anti-tanky left is reactionary and politically illiterate.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.400
So where does this person fit in?

07:43.400 --> 07:46.800
A lot of BreadTube, a lot of the more vocal socialists we're currently dealing with, who

07:46.800 --> 07:51.840
are all screaming that SJWs aren't real leftists, these people, they're libertarian socialists,

07:51.840 --> 07:56.360
or libertarian left, and regardless of where we all know their politics end up, their rhetoric

07:56.360 --> 07:58.400
is still very anti-tanky.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.280
Are they not real leftists now too?

08:00.280 --> 08:03.900
I mean apparently Vosch is also a rad lib, according to these people.

08:03.900 --> 08:08.580
And the Stalinists are rad libs too, so both the tankies and the anti-tankies are rad

08:08.580 --> 08:10.060
libs, depending on who you're talking to.

08:10.060 --> 08:14.060
This is the problem with leftists redefining the problematic parts out of the left, they

08:14.060 --> 08:18.020
cannot agree on what the problem is, because ultimately it boils down to everything that's

08:18.020 --> 08:22.900
on the left but is not the speaker's specific position is not true leftism, and to any of

08:22.900 --> 08:27.380
us sane outsiders looking in, it seems like the entire left is corrupt.

08:27.380 --> 08:31.780
Vosch got wind that I focused on him in my What is a Grifter video, a good video in my

08:31.780 --> 08:32.780
opinion.

08:32.780 --> 08:33.780
I suggest you watch it.

08:33.780 --> 08:55.500
And he complained that I'm a fascist, trying to paint him as a fake leftist.

08:55.500 --> 09:00.180
Vosch as usual missed the point, I'm obviously not a fascist, but more importantly I don't

09:00.180 --> 09:04.900
actually think Vosch is a fake leftist, I actually think he is the most real leftist

09:04.900 --> 09:09.200
out there, because he embodies all of the corruption and decay and hypocrisy eating

09:09.200 --> 09:10.660
away at the left's foundation.

09:10.660 --> 09:14.980
He is the tumor telling everybody else that they are also tumors, and while he's correct,

09:14.980 --> 09:19.620
he's missing that one key point, that only somebody with the capability of self-reflection

09:19.620 --> 09:20.620
can comprehend.

09:20.620 --> 09:24.520
We're nearing the end of the video, and I haven't even mentioned Lindsay Ellis yet.

09:24.520 --> 09:28.120
I have a previous video on Lindsay Ellis, formerly known as the Nostalgia Check, if

09:28.120 --> 09:32.120
you want to watch that to get a feel of who she is, but it's not really necessary.

09:32.120 --> 09:34.660
Lindsay Ellis got cancelled for this take.

09:34.660 --> 09:38.360
I watched Raya and the Last Dragon, and I think we need to come up with a name for this

09:38.360 --> 09:41.080
genre that is basically Avatar the Last Airbender.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.920
It's like half of all young adult fantasy published in the last few years anyway.

09:44.920 --> 09:47.920
It's a rather lukewarm take, nothing too objectionable about it.

09:47.920 --> 09:52.720
It's stupid, yes, because comparing Raya to Avatar in this way is like listening to jazz

09:52.720 --> 09:56.720
music and saying oh this is like Persona 5, but it's not racist or whatever.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.840
And yet she's being cancelled for racism.

09:58.840 --> 10:01.760
She's being dragged across Twitter for racism.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.800
She is now public enemy number one because of racism.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.420
It doesn't matter that she is politically a leftist.

10:07.420 --> 10:10.680
All of her lefty takes and all of her lefty videos don't matter.

10:10.680 --> 10:12.760
It's one bad take and she's cancelled.

10:12.760 --> 10:17.280
That being said, with our knowledge of the not real leftism infighting that's been happening

10:17.280 --> 10:20.360
right now, let's examine the situation critically.

10:20.360 --> 10:25.980
I know that BreadTube and non-socialist SJW LeftyTube do not like each other at all.

10:25.980 --> 10:29.060
And right now, BreadTube is on the popularity upswing.

10:29.060 --> 10:34.260
Lindsay Ellis talks a little bit about class in her analysis, but is largely on the SJW

10:34.260 --> 10:35.260
side.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.060
And by the way, this is a fundamental problem that online conservatives are facing right

10:38.060 --> 10:39.060
now.

10:39.060 --> 10:40.820
They don't see the difference between the two groups.

10:40.820 --> 10:45.860
The dirtbag left, as they call themselves, have no problem with being edgy, making jokes,

10:45.860 --> 10:50.700
using slurs, and they are generally the ones focusing on socialism at the expense of idpol.

10:50.700 --> 10:54.580
It's the social justice warriors that are the snowflakes, who crumple at their first

10:54.580 --> 10:55.580
encounter with criticism.

10:56.180 --> 11:01.300
And yet conservatives stupidly say, so much for the tolerant left, when the dirtbags actually

11:01.300 --> 11:02.500
punch them back.

11:02.500 --> 11:06.940
Conservatives, you have not yet realized you're opposing two different groups with different

11:06.940 --> 11:11.500
methods who, despite being related philosophically, hate one another.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.260
And of course, there's also a lot of laughs to be had here, sure.

11:14.260 --> 11:17.580
Lindsay Ellis talked in the past about trending when she's inevitably cancelled, and lo and

11:17.580 --> 11:19.700
behold, she's cancelled and she's trending.

11:19.700 --> 11:23.220
Lindsay Ellis btfo's Moviebob, turns out Moviebob wins.

11:23.340 --> 11:27.140
Lindsay Ellis is a wokescold, and her own wokescold audience rips her apart over nothing.

11:27.140 --> 11:30.200
I'm enjoying watching the shitstorm as much as everybody else.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.580
But I think we're all missing a larger point.

11:32.580 --> 11:37.340
Socialists are trying, in my opinion mostly in vain, to redefine the problematic elements

11:37.340 --> 11:38.340
out of the left.

11:38.340 --> 11:42.180
So that when cancel culture comes for them, as it inevitably will, they'll be able to

11:42.180 --> 11:44.940
frame it as liberals attacking leftists yet again.

11:44.940 --> 11:46.740
Because that is the socialist worldview.

11:46.740 --> 11:49.740
They view liberalism as the handmaiden of fascism.

11:49.740 --> 11:51.980
Scratch a lib and a fascist bleeds.

11:51.980 --> 11:53.580
Communism enables the Nazis.

11:53.580 --> 11:54.580
Liberals get the bullet too.

11:54.580 --> 11:55.580
Blah blah blah.

11:55.580 --> 12:00.300
It's a fundamentally false view, and yes, I've got a video on why it's false coming

12:00.300 --> 12:01.300
up.

12:01.300 --> 12:02.300
Let me finish reading my books, guys.

12:02.300 --> 12:05.900
But it's a view that only makes sense if you squint really really hard, and if you

12:05.900 --> 12:10.220
can manage to redefine regressive leftist elements out of the left.

12:10.220 --> 12:11.840
So let's not let them.

12:11.840 --> 12:13.140
Because they aren't liberals.

12:13.140 --> 12:16.140
They say it proudly, and we should remind them of that fact.

12:16.140 --> 12:20.460
Remember that every single time a communist says they want to raise class consciousness,

12:20.460 --> 12:24.140
there's nothing different between that and raising racial consciousness.

12:24.140 --> 12:26.180
With the sole exception of a different coat of paint.

12:26.180 --> 12:28.180
That's not the rad libs doing that.

12:28.180 --> 12:33.500
That's the socialists' own dumb collectivist theory backfiring in their faces.

12:33.500 --> 12:36.100
They just don't like how their ideas play out sometimes.

12:36.100 --> 12:38.020
We are the individualists here.

12:38.020 --> 12:39.580
We're not collectivists.

12:39.580 --> 12:43.980
And no matter what differences exist between SJWs and socialists right now, they are still

12:43.980 --> 12:48.740
fundamentally feuding siblings, and they are in no way related to liberalism.

12:48.740 --> 12:53.540
Lindsay Ellis is not a rad lib, and the people who are cancelling her are not rad libs.

12:53.540 --> 12:59.180
She is a leftist, those people are leftists, and the left eats its own as a matter of course.

12:59.180 --> 13:03.640
She has cultivated a fundamentally toxic audience, and must now live with the consequence of

13:03.640 --> 13:04.700
those actions.

13:04.700 --> 13:09.000
Those consequences are not liberalism, simply because the socialists don't like where

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
their ideas lead.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.940
And in the end, the socialist objection to this analysis of the situation amounts to

13:13.940 --> 13:18.060
nothing more than the denialism of the evil of their own ideas.

13:18.060 --> 13:20.660
The rad lib paradox is a simple one.

13:20.660 --> 13:22.280
These people aren't liberals.

13:22.280 --> 13:26.060
They are being forcibly defined as liberals for a political purpose.

13:26.060 --> 13:28.460
But their ideas are not liberal ones.

13:28.460 --> 13:34.100
And the only paradox here is how anybody could possibly be so fooled as to consider them

13:34.100 --> 13:35.860
liberals at all.

13:35.860 --> 13:37.600
Thank you for watching my friends.

So I'll see you tomorrow.

I love you.
