0	10480	When Rush Limbaugh was first rising to prominence, he started a trend among conservatives that
10480	14280	continues to this day, of conflating socialists with liberals.
14280	17540	I don't know if he actually believed that they were the same thing, but for the sake
17540	21620	of argument, let's assume that he wasn't that stupid and he was just being hyperbolic.
21620	26420	It's clear to anybody with a brain that the free speech, free market, rights and individualism
26420	31020	of liberalism is not the same thing as the proletariat revolution, communal ownership,
31020	34000	historic materialism and collectivism of socialism.
34000	38600	But to conflate a legitimate yet marginalized evil with those people who are, in the grand
38600	42700	scheme of things, just slightly to the left of you but constitute your largest opponent,
42700	44280	rhetorically makes a lot of sense.
44280	46180	The problem is, it isn't true.
46180	50980	And yet you see a lot of conservatives doing it to this day, from old style Fox News talking
50980	54380	heads to conservative and libertarian YouTubers.
54380	57060	Something's about all the bad stuff the libs are doing.
57060	61340	In the past couple of years, the socialists have tried to pull a similar linguistic sigh
61340	62340	off.
62340	65700	I'm sure you've noticed recently that all of the regressive lefty garbage that nearly
65700	69460	everybody hates is slowly being defined out of the left.
69460	75160	The feminists, the SJWs, the race grifters, they're no longer leftists but libs, or less
75160	76780	commonly rad libs.
76780	80860	And the TERFs, don't get me started on the TERFs, they've been redefined as right wing.
80860	85040	Which is ridiculous because TERFs are still feminists and there's no feminism on the right.
85040	89780	The idea is, though, that if the left is the only political tent that houses legitimate
89780	94160	progress, and the socialists wholeheartedly believe that to be the case, then all of that
94160	97220	regressive lefty garbage simply isn't lefty at all.
97220	100600	This idea is, of course, nonsense on the face of it.
100600	103900	Identity politics is not a toolkit in the classical liberal's belt.
103900	108660	It may be in the neo-liberals, but not out of any kind of racial or gender solidarity,
108660	111500	rather it's for exploitation and masking as representation.
111500	115020	And yes, that is very similar to the idpol of the left.
115020	118660	But the classical liberal position, not the conservative position or whatever else you
118660	123680	may take that statement to mean, I mean the original liberal position, the Lockean position,
123680	125560	is fundamentally colorblindness.
125560	130500	It is free speech, free markets, fairness before the eyes of the law, property and self-determination.
130500	133980	And before you say that the original liberal governments of the enlightenment weren't
133980	135880	this ideal, yes, I agree.
135880	137940	The problem with those is that they're not liberal enough.
137940	140640	The problem with our current governments is that they're not liberal enough.
140640	143800	The wordplay landscape looks a little something like this.
143800	147820	People on the right are incorrectly calling people on the left liberals.
147820	152040	And people on the left are also incorrectly calling other people on the left, those people
152040	154820	whom they specifically disapprove of, liberals.
154820	158980	Funnily enough, both the left and the right have recognized a cancerous growth within
158980	159980	the left.
159980	165420	But the right purposefully misidentified it for short-term rhetorical gain, with disastrous
165420	167700	long-term consequences in my opinion.
167700	170820	While the left would rather ignore the growing tumor entirely.
170820	171820	What is the cancer?
171820	173620	Well, that depends on who you ask.
173620	178020	There are broadly two camps within the left, the socialists and the SJWs.
178020	181120	The socialists are focused exclusively on class struggle.
181120	184900	Some of them think Marx was correct and want to see a dictatorship of the proletariat implement
184900	188660	the worldwide moneyless, stateless, classless, communist utopia.
188660	192980	Some of them are market socialists, or anarcho-socialists, or libertarian socialists.
192980	194220	It honestly doesn't matter too much.
194220	196760	The point is that they're united by class issues.
196760	200760	They are the no-war-but-class-war people, and they are predominantly the ones pointing
200760	205000	at all the regressive garbage within their own camp and saying, no, that's not us, that's
205000	206000	the libs.
206000	211660	The second camp, the SJWs, are generally what the first camp means when it points to regressive
211660	212660	garbage.
212660	217640	These are the Robin DeAngelos, the Jeff Tiedriches, the Emily Gorsenskys, the Tariq Nasheeds and
217640	218800	the Shaun Kings.
218800	223880	There is currently an attempt by the socialist left to push the idpol left out of the left,
223880	228640	because the socialists view them as distracting from the class war with a race war, or a gender
228640	229720	war, or a trans war.
229720	233880	They call it performative wokeness, or they'll claim it's not real leftism, or some of their
233880	238200	such garbage, because it's not specifically and exclusively anti-capitalist.
238200	242240	But nonetheless, the idpol of the left, or the idpol of what these people call the rad
242240	246000	libs, ultimately does stem from Marxist analysis.
246000	249640	Marx's conception of the relationship between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has been
249640	254040	co-opted for idpol analysis of other dominant and oppressed groups for probably about as
254040	255840	long as Marxism has existed.
255840	260380	After all, Black Lives Matter, an organization founded by a Marxist using Marxist principles
260380	264720	in its analysis, is ultimately a radical idpol movement, and it's certainly not liberal.
264720	267400	We actually do have an ideological frame.
267400	272360	Myself and Alicia in particular are trained organizers.
272360	276440	We are trained Marxists.
276440	288160	We are super versed on sort of ideological theories, and I think that what we really
288160	293640	try to do is build a movement that could be utilized by many, many black folk.
293640	297320	We don't necessarily want to be the vanguard of this movement.
297320	302620	I think we've tried to put out a political frame that's about centering who we think
302620	308580	are the most vulnerable amongst the black community to really fight for all of our lives.
308580	314960	Harry White, a British communist, wrote to Stalin in 1934 asking if, I quote, a homosexual
314960	318240	can be considered someone worthy of membership in the communist party.
318240	321760	Stalin called White an idiot and a degenerate, again a quote.
321760	327120	And to their credit, Stalin is not well-liked amongst a segment of the online left for his
327120	328120	authoritarianism.
328120	332920	But regardless, White's questioning of Stalin, even back then, used the Marxist framework
332920	335780	as a justification for his LGBT analysis.
335780	340740	White wrote in his letter, on the whole, the condition of homosexuals under capitalism
340740	344920	is analogous to the condition of women, the colored races, ethnic minorities, and other
344920	347560	groups that are repressed for one reason or another.
347560	352280	And just as the women of the bourgeois class suffer to a significantly lesser degree from
352280	357120	the injustices of the capitalist regime, so do natural-born homosexuals of the dominant
357120	362020	class suffer much less from persecution than homosexuals from the working class milieu.
362020	366360	The ideas in White's letter are identical to the ideas put forward by the people whom
366360	368520	socialists call the rad-libs.
368520	370800	And yet these are clearly not the words of a liberal.
370800	375800	They are the words of a socialist, using the Marxist framework to justify identity politics.
375800	380280	The fact that White was correct, that the Stalinists were violently purging gay people
380280	385060	in the Soviet Union, isn't relevant to the conclusion that leftist idpol cannot simply
385060	389240	be defined out of the left, but is in fact an intrinsic part of it.
389240	392600	Marxism is idpol, and it can never be anything but.
392600	397480	You have to enforce an us-versus-them sort of tribalism to get any kind of workers' revolution
397480	398480	going.
398480	403040	And that same ethic is why, for example, Black Lives Matter exists the way that it does.
403280	408400	It is not an organic growth of the people, but rather imposed by clever propagandists.
408400	413880	Challenge magazine, the outlet of Britain's Young Communist League, even released a pamphlet
413880	418120	describing how all of the regressive shit on the left was not truly leftist, but instead
418120	419780	radical liberalism.
419780	425040	Even though the pamphlet itself quotes Engels as saying that identity-based politics has
425040	429300	its place within the socialist revolution, to them the first principle must be economic,
429300	433020	as they believe solving the economic problem would largely solve all other idpol problems.
433020	437540	The socialists don't view class as being simply another variable in the equation, but
437540	442780	the only variable, and so the SJWs are rad libs, not true leftists, forgetting entirely
442780	446660	that a true liberal would consider them both to be abominations, just of a different, yet
446660	447660	related sort.
447660	452080	And the reason for it is quite clear, yes, the SJWs are using the socialist framework
452080	455280	to examine non-socialist issues, but that's not the only reason.
455280	457040	Consider this black hole brain take.
457040	461120	The anti-tanky left is reactionary and politically illiterate.
461120	463400	So where does this person fit in?
463400	466800	A lot of BreadTube, a lot of the more vocal socialists we're currently dealing with, who
466800	471840	are all screaming that SJWs aren't real leftists, these people, they're libertarian socialists,
471840	476360	or libertarian left, and regardless of where we all know their politics end up, their rhetoric
476360	478400	is still very anti-tanky.
478400	480280	Are they not real leftists now too?
480280	483900	I mean apparently Vosch is also a rad lib, according to these people.
483900	488580	And the Stalinists are rad libs too, so both the tankies and the anti-tankies are rad
488580	490060	libs, depending on who you're talking to.
490060	494060	This is the problem with leftists redefining the problematic parts out of the left, they
494060	498020	cannot agree on what the problem is, because ultimately it boils down to everything that's
498020	502900	on the left but is not the speaker's specific position is not true leftism, and to any of
502900	507380	us sane outsiders looking in, it seems like the entire left is corrupt.
507380	511780	Vosch got wind that I focused on him in my What is a Grifter video, a good video in my
511780	512780	opinion.
512780	513780	I suggest you watch it.
513780	535500	And he complained that I'm a fascist, trying to paint him as a fake leftist.
535500	540180	Vosch as usual missed the point, I'm obviously not a fascist, but more importantly I don't
540180	544900	actually think Vosch is a fake leftist, I actually think he is the most real leftist
544900	549200	out there, because he embodies all of the corruption and decay and hypocrisy eating
549200	550660	away at the left's foundation.
550660	554980	He is the tumor telling everybody else that they are also tumors, and while he's correct,
554980	559620	he's missing that one key point, that only somebody with the capability of self-reflection
559620	560620	can comprehend.
560620	564520	We're nearing the end of the video, and I haven't even mentioned Lindsay Ellis yet.
564520	568120	I have a previous video on Lindsay Ellis, formerly known as the Nostalgia Check, if
568120	572120	you want to watch that to get a feel of who she is, but it's not really necessary.
572120	574660	Lindsay Ellis got cancelled for this take.
574660	578360	I watched Raya and the Last Dragon, and I think we need to come up with a name for this
578360	581080	genre that is basically Avatar the Last Airbender.
581080	584920	It's like half of all young adult fantasy published in the last few years anyway.
584920	587920	It's a rather lukewarm take, nothing too objectionable about it.
587920	592720	It's stupid, yes, because comparing Raya to Avatar in this way is like listening to jazz
592720	596720	music and saying oh this is like Persona 5, but it's not racist or whatever.
596720	598840	And yet she's being cancelled for racism.
598840	601760	She's being dragged across Twitter for racism.
601760	604800	She is now public enemy number one because of racism.
604800	607420	It doesn't matter that she is politically a leftist.
607420	610680	All of her lefty takes and all of her lefty videos don't matter.
610680	612760	It's one bad take and she's cancelled.
612760	617280	That being said, with our knowledge of the not real leftism infighting that's been happening
617280	620360	right now, let's examine the situation critically.
620360	625980	I know that BreadTube and non-socialist SJW LeftyTube do not like each other at all.
625980	629060	And right now, BreadTube is on the popularity upswing.
629060	634260	Lindsay Ellis talks a little bit about class in her analysis, but is largely on the SJW
634260	635260	side.
635260	638060	And by the way, this is a fundamental problem that online conservatives are facing right
638060	639060	now.
639060	640820	They don't see the difference between the two groups.
640820	645860	The dirtbag left, as they call themselves, have no problem with being edgy, making jokes,
645860	650700	using slurs, and they are generally the ones focusing on socialism at the expense of idpol.
650700	654580	It's the social justice warriors that are the snowflakes, who crumple at their first
654580	655580	encounter with criticism.
656180	661300	And yet conservatives stupidly say, so much for the tolerant left, when the dirtbags actually
661300	662500	punch them back.
662500	666940	Conservatives, you have not yet realized you're opposing two different groups with different
666940	671500	methods who, despite being related philosophically, hate one another.
671500	674260	And of course, there's also a lot of laughs to be had here, sure.
674260	677580	Lindsay Ellis talked in the past about trending when she's inevitably cancelled, and lo and
677580	679700	behold, she's cancelled and she's trending.
679700	683220	Lindsay Ellis btfo's Moviebob, turns out Moviebob wins.
683340	687140	Lindsay Ellis is a wokescold, and her own wokescold audience rips her apart over nothing.
687140	690200	I'm enjoying watching the shitstorm as much as everybody else.
690200	692580	But I think we're all missing a larger point.
692580	697340	Socialists are trying, in my opinion mostly in vain, to redefine the problematic elements
697340	698340	out of the left.
698340	702180	So that when cancel culture comes for them, as it inevitably will, they'll be able to
702180	704940	frame it as liberals attacking leftists yet again.
704940	706740	Because that is the socialist worldview.
706740	709740	They view liberalism as the handmaiden of fascism.
709740	711980	Scratch a lib and a fascist bleeds.
711980	713580	Communism enables the Nazis.
713580	714580	Liberals get the bullet too.
714580	715580	Blah blah blah.
715580	720300	It's a fundamentally false view, and yes, I've got a video on why it's false coming
720300	721300	up.
721300	722300	Let me finish reading my books, guys.
722300	725900	But it's a view that only makes sense if you squint really really hard, and if you
725900	730220	can manage to redefine regressive leftist elements out of the left.
730220	731840	So let's not let them.
731840	733140	Because they aren't liberals.
733140	736140	They say it proudly, and we should remind them of that fact.
736140	740460	Remember that every single time a communist says they want to raise class consciousness,
740460	744140	there's nothing different between that and raising racial consciousness.
744140	746180	With the sole exception of a different coat of paint.
746180	748180	That's not the rad libs doing that.
748180	753500	That's the socialists' own dumb collectivist theory backfiring in their faces.
753500	756100	They just don't like how their ideas play out sometimes.
756100	758020	We are the individualists here.
758020	759580	We're not collectivists.
759580	763980	And no matter what differences exist between SJWs and socialists right now, they are still
763980	768740	fundamentally feuding siblings, and they are in no way related to liberalism.
768740	773540	Lindsay Ellis is not a rad lib, and the people who are cancelling her are not rad libs.
773540	779180	She is a leftist, those people are leftists, and the left eats its own as a matter of course.
779180	783640	She has cultivated a fundamentally toxic audience, and must now live with the consequence of
783640	784700	those actions.
784700	789000	Those consequences are not liberalism, simply because the socialists don't like where
789000	790000	their ideas lead.
790000	793940	And in the end, the socialist objection to this analysis of the situation amounts to
793940	798060	nothing more than the denialism of the evil of their own ideas.
798060	800660	The rad lib paradox is a simple one.
800660	802280	These people aren't liberals.
802280	806060	They are being forcibly defined as liberals for a political purpose.
806060	808460	But their ideas are not liberal ones.
808460	814100	And the only paradox here is how anybody could possibly be so fooled as to consider them
814100	815860	liberals at all.
