1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,480
When Rush Limbaugh was first rising to prominence, he started a trend among conservatives that

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,280
continues to this day, of conflating socialists with liberals.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,540
I don't know if he actually believed that they were the same thing, but for the sake

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,620
of argument, let's assume that he wasn't that stupid and he was just being hyperbolic.

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,420
It's clear to anybody with a brain that the free speech, free market, rights and individualism

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,020
of liberalism is not the same thing as the proletariat revolution, communal ownership,

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,000
historic materialism and collectivism of socialism.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,600
But to conflate a legitimate yet marginalized evil with those people who are, in the grand

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,700
scheme of things, just slightly to the left of you but constitute your largest opponent,

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,280
rhetorically makes a lot of sense.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,180
The problem is, it isn't true.

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,980
And yet you see a lot of conservatives doing it to this day, from old style Fox News talking

13
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,380
heads to conservative and libertarian YouTubers.

14
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,060
Something's about all the bad stuff the libs are doing.

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,340
In the past couple of years, the socialists have tried to pull a similar linguistic sigh

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,340
off.

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,700
I'm sure you've noticed recently that all of the regressive lefty garbage that nearly

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,460
everybody hates is slowly being defined out of the left.

19
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,160
The feminists, the SJWs, the race grifters, they're no longer leftists but libs, or less

20
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,780
commonly rad libs.

21
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,860
And the TERFs, don't get me started on the TERFs, they've been redefined as right wing.

22
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,040
Which is ridiculous because TERFs are still feminists and there's no feminism on the right.

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,780
The idea is, though, that if the left is the only political tent that houses legitimate

24
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,160
progress, and the socialists wholeheartedly believe that to be the case, then all of that

25
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,220
regressive lefty garbage simply isn't lefty at all.

26
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,600
This idea is, of course, nonsense on the face of it.

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,900
Identity politics is not a toolkit in the classical liberal's belt.

28
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,660
It may be in the neo-liberals, but not out of any kind of racial or gender solidarity,

29
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,500
rather it's for exploitation and masking as representation.

30
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,020
And yes, that is very similar to the idpol of the left.

31
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,660
But the classical liberal position, not the conservative position or whatever else you

32
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,680
may take that statement to mean, I mean the original liberal position, the Lockean position,

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,560
is fundamentally colorblindness.

34
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,500
It is free speech, free markets, fairness before the eyes of the law, property and self-determination.

35
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,980
And before you say that the original liberal governments of the enlightenment weren't

36
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,880
this ideal, yes, I agree.

37
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,940
The problem with those is that they're not liberal enough.

38
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,640
The problem with our current governments is that they're not liberal enough.

39
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,800
The wordplay landscape looks a little something like this.

40
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,820
People on the right are incorrectly calling people on the left liberals.

41
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,040
And people on the left are also incorrectly calling other people on the left, those people

42
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,820
whom they specifically disapprove of, liberals.

43
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,980
Funnily enough, both the left and the right have recognized a cancerous growth within

44
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,980
the left.

45
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,420
But the right purposefully misidentified it for short-term rhetorical gain, with disastrous

46
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,700
long-term consequences in my opinion.

47
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,820
While the left would rather ignore the growing tumor entirely.

48
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,820
What is the cancer?

49
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,620
Well, that depends on who you ask.

50
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,020
There are broadly two camps within the left, the socialists and the SJWs.

51
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,120
The socialists are focused exclusively on class struggle.

52
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,900
Some of them think Marx was correct and want to see a dictatorship of the proletariat implement

53
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,660
the worldwide moneyless, stateless, classless, communist utopia.

54
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,980
Some of them are market socialists, or anarcho-socialists, or libertarian socialists.

55
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,220
It honestly doesn't matter too much.

56
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,760
The point is that they're united by class issues.

57
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,760
They are the no-war-but-class-war people, and they are predominantly the ones pointing

58
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,000
at all the regressive garbage within their own camp and saying, no, that's not us, that's

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
the libs.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,660
The second camp, the SJWs, are generally what the first camp means when it points to regressive

61
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,660
garbage.

62
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:37,640
These are the Robin DeAngelos, the Jeff Tiedriches, the Emily Gorsenskys, the Tariq Nasheeds and

63
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,800
the Shaun Kings.

64
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,880
There is currently an attempt by the socialist left to push the idpol left out of the left,

65
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,640
because the socialists view them as distracting from the class war with a race war, or a gender

66
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,720
war, or a trans war.

67
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,880
They call it performative wokeness, or they'll claim it's not real leftism, or some of their

68
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,200
such garbage, because it's not specifically and exclusively anti-capitalist.

69
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,240
But nonetheless, the idpol of the left, or the idpol of what these people call the rad

70
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,000
libs, ultimately does stem from Marxist analysis.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,640
Marx's conception of the relationship between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has been

72
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,040
co-opted for idpol analysis of other dominant and oppressed groups for probably about as

73
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,840
long as Marxism has existed.

74
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,380
After all, Black Lives Matter, an organization founded by a Marxist using Marxist principles

75
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,720
in its analysis, is ultimately a radical idpol movement, and it's certainly not liberal.

76
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,400
We actually do have an ideological frame.

77
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,360
Myself and Alicia in particular are trained organizers.

78
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,440
We are trained Marxists.

79
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:48,160
We are super versed on sort of ideological theories, and I think that what we really

80
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,640
try to do is build a movement that could be utilized by many, many black folk.

81
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,320
We don't necessarily want to be the vanguard of this movement.

82
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,620
I think we've tried to put out a political frame that's about centering who we think

83
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,580
are the most vulnerable amongst the black community to really fight for all of our lives.

84
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,960
Harry White, a British communist, wrote to Stalin in 1934 asking if, I quote, a homosexual

85
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,240
can be considered someone worthy of membership in the communist party.

86
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,760
Stalin called White an idiot and a degenerate, again a quote.

87
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,120
And to their credit, Stalin is not well-liked amongst a segment of the online left for his

88
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
authoritarianism.

89
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,920
But regardless, White's questioning of Stalin, even back then, used the Marxist framework

90
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,780
as a justification for his LGBT analysis.

91
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,740
White wrote in his letter, on the whole, the condition of homosexuals under capitalism

92
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,920
is analogous to the condition of women, the colored races, ethnic minorities, and other

93
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,560
groups that are repressed for one reason or another.

94
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,280
And just as the women of the bourgeois class suffer to a significantly lesser degree from

95
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,120
the injustices of the capitalist regime, so do natural-born homosexuals of the dominant

96
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,020
class suffer much less from persecution than homosexuals from the working class milieu.

97
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,360
The ideas in White's letter are identical to the ideas put forward by the people whom

98
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,520
socialists call the rad-libs.

99
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,800
And yet these are clearly not the words of a liberal.

100
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,800
They are the words of a socialist, using the Marxist framework to justify identity politics.

101
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,280
The fact that White was correct, that the Stalinists were violently purging gay people

102
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,060
in the Soviet Union, isn't relevant to the conclusion that leftist idpol cannot simply

103
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,240
be defined out of the left, but is in fact an intrinsic part of it.

104
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,600
Marxism is idpol, and it can never be anything but.

105
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,480
You have to enforce an us-versus-them sort of tribalism to get any kind of workers' revolution

106
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
going.

107
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,040
And that same ethic is why, for example, Black Lives Matter exists the way that it does.

108
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,400
It is not an organic growth of the people, but rather imposed by clever propagandists.

109
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,880
Challenge magazine, the outlet of Britain's Young Communist League, even released a pamphlet

110
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,120
describing how all of the regressive shit on the left was not truly leftist, but instead

111
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,780
radical liberalism.

112
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,040
Even though the pamphlet itself quotes Engels as saying that identity-based politics has

113
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,300
its place within the socialist revolution, to them the first principle must be economic,

114
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,020
as they believe solving the economic problem would largely solve all other idpol problems.

115
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,540
The socialists don't view class as being simply another variable in the equation, but

116
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,780
the only variable, and so the SJWs are rad libs, not true leftists, forgetting entirely

117
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,660
that a true liberal would consider them both to be abominations, just of a different, yet

118
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,660
related sort.

119
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,080
And the reason for it is quite clear, yes, the SJWs are using the socialist framework

120
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,280
to examine non-socialist issues, but that's not the only reason.

121
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,040
Consider this black hole brain take.

122
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,120
The anti-tanky left is reactionary and politically illiterate.

123
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,400
So where does this person fit in?

124
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,800
A lot of BreadTube, a lot of the more vocal socialists we're currently dealing with, who

125
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,840
are all screaming that SJWs aren't real leftists, these people, they're libertarian socialists,

126
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,360
or libertarian left, and regardless of where we all know their politics end up, their rhetoric

127
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,400
is still very anti-tanky.

128
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,280
Are they not real leftists now too?

129
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,900
I mean apparently Vosch is also a rad lib, according to these people.

130
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,580
And the Stalinists are rad libs too, so both the tankies and the anti-tankies are rad

131
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,060
libs, depending on who you're talking to.

132
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,060
This is the problem with leftists redefining the problematic parts out of the left, they

133
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,020
cannot agree on what the problem is, because ultimately it boils down to everything that's

134
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,900
on the left but is not the speaker's specific position is not true leftism, and to any of

135
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,380
us sane outsiders looking in, it seems like the entire left is corrupt.

136
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,780
Vosch got wind that I focused on him in my What is a Grifter video, a good video in my

137
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,780
opinion.

138
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,780
I suggest you watch it.

139
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:55,500
And he complained that I'm a fascist, trying to paint him as a fake leftist.

140
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,180
Vosch as usual missed the point, I'm obviously not a fascist, but more importantly I don't

141
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,900
actually think Vosch is a fake leftist, I actually think he is the most real leftist

142
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,200
out there, because he embodies all of the corruption and decay and hypocrisy eating

143
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,660
away at the left's foundation.

144
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,980
He is the tumor telling everybody else that they are also tumors, and while he's correct,

145
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,620
he's missing that one key point, that only somebody with the capability of self-reflection

146
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,620
can comprehend.

147
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,520
We're nearing the end of the video, and I haven't even mentioned Lindsay Ellis yet.

148
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,120
I have a previous video on Lindsay Ellis, formerly known as the Nostalgia Check, if

149
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,120
you want to watch that to get a feel of who she is, but it's not really necessary.

150
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,660
Lindsay Ellis got cancelled for this take.

151
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,360
I watched Raya and the Last Dragon, and I think we need to come up with a name for this

152
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,080
genre that is basically Avatar the Last Airbender.

153
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,920
It's like half of all young adult fantasy published in the last few years anyway.

154
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,920
It's a rather lukewarm take, nothing too objectionable about it.

155
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,720
It's stupid, yes, because comparing Raya to Avatar in this way is like listening to jazz

156
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,720
music and saying oh this is like Persona 5, but it's not racist or whatever.

157
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,840
And yet she's being cancelled for racism.

158
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,760
She's being dragged across Twitter for racism.

159
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,800
She is now public enemy number one because of racism.

160
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,420
It doesn't matter that she is politically a leftist.

161
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,680
All of her lefty takes and all of her lefty videos don't matter.

162
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,760
It's one bad take and she's cancelled.

163
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,280
That being said, with our knowledge of the not real leftism infighting that's been happening

164
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,360
right now, let's examine the situation critically.

165
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,980
I know that BreadTube and non-socialist SJW LeftyTube do not like each other at all.

166
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,060
And right now, BreadTube is on the popularity upswing.

167
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:34,260
Lindsay Ellis talks a little bit about class in her analysis, but is largely on the SJW

168
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,260
side.

169
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,060
And by the way, this is a fundamental problem that online conservatives are facing right

170
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,060
now.

171
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,820
They don't see the difference between the two groups.

172
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,860
The dirtbag left, as they call themselves, have no problem with being edgy, making jokes,

173
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,700
using slurs, and they are generally the ones focusing on socialism at the expense of idpol.

174
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,580
It's the social justice warriors that are the snowflakes, who crumple at their first

175
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,580
encounter with criticism.

176
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,300
And yet conservatives stupidly say, so much for the tolerant left, when the dirtbags actually

177
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,500
punch them back.

178
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,940
Conservatives, you have not yet realized you're opposing two different groups with different

179
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:11,500
methods who, despite being related philosophically, hate one another.

180
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,260
And of course, there's also a lot of laughs to be had here, sure.

181
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,580
Lindsay Ellis talked in the past about trending when she's inevitably cancelled, and lo and

182
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,700
behold, she's cancelled and she's trending.

183
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,220
Lindsay Ellis btfo's Moviebob, turns out Moviebob wins.

184
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,140
Lindsay Ellis is a wokescold, and her own wokescold audience rips her apart over nothing.

185
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,200
I'm enjoying watching the shitstorm as much as everybody else.

186
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,580
But I think we're all missing a larger point.

187
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,340
Socialists are trying, in my opinion mostly in vain, to redefine the problematic elements

188
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,340
out of the left.

189
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,180
So that when cancel culture comes for them, as it inevitably will, they'll be able to

190
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,940
frame it as liberals attacking leftists yet again.

191
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,740
Because that is the socialist worldview.

192
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,740
They view liberalism as the handmaiden of fascism.

193
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,980
Scratch a lib and a fascist bleeds.

194
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,580
Communism enables the Nazis.

195
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,580
Liberals get the bullet too.

196
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,580
Blah blah blah.

197
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:00,300
It's a fundamentally false view, and yes, I've got a video on why it's false coming

198
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,300
up.

199
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,300
Let me finish reading my books, guys.

200
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,900
But it's a view that only makes sense if you squint really really hard, and if you

201
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,220
can manage to redefine regressive leftist elements out of the left.

202
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,840
So let's not let them.

203
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,140
Because they aren't liberals.

204
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,140
They say it proudly, and we should remind them of that fact.

205
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,460
Remember that every single time a communist says they want to raise class consciousness,

206
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,140
there's nothing different between that and raising racial consciousness.

207
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,180
With the sole exception of a different coat of paint.

208
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,180
That's not the rad libs doing that.

209
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,500
That's the socialists' own dumb collectivist theory backfiring in their faces.

210
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,100
They just don't like how their ideas play out sometimes.

211
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,020
We are the individualists here.

212
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,580
We're not collectivists.

213
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,980
And no matter what differences exist between SJWs and socialists right now, they are still

214
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,740
fundamentally feuding siblings, and they are in no way related to liberalism.

215
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,540
Lindsay Ellis is not a rad lib, and the people who are cancelling her are not rad libs.

216
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:59,180
She is a leftist, those people are leftists, and the left eats its own as a matter of course.

217
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,640
She has cultivated a fundamentally toxic audience, and must now live with the consequence of

218
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,700
those actions.

219
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,000
Those consequences are not liberalism, simply because the socialists don't like where

220
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
their ideas lead.

221
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,940
And in the end, the socialist objection to this analysis of the situation amounts to

222
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,060
nothing more than the denialism of the evil of their own ideas.

223
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,660
The rad lib paradox is a simple one.

224
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,280
These people aren't liberals.

225
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,060
They are being forcibly defined as liberals for a political purpose.

226
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,460
But their ideas are not liberal ones.

227
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:34,100
And the only paradox here is how anybody could possibly be so fooled as to consider them

228
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,860
liberals at all.

229
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,600
