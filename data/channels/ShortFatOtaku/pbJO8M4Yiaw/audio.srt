00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,440
Hey, you know that Twitter account Liminal Spaces, or, uh, Space Liminal Bot, if you

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,440
want to go by the handle?

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,920
It's kinda unique in that it posts images of, well, what it calls liminal spaces.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,040
Sometimes these are pictures of long hallways, dilapidated and dark, or perfectly normal

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,920
and well-lit, or appearing like it's a place out of time, like it's still a functioning

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,600
location just with an older aesthetic style, like the decor hasn't been updated since

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,600
the 80s.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,400
These pictures can sometimes generate a sense of unease, almost like there's something

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,560
way down at the end of the hallway that's coming for you, but they can also generate

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,600
a feeling of comfort sometimes, like a place that you used to visit but no longer can because

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
it's gone.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,240
Maybe it's been renovated, maybe it's been torn down, whatever.

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,960
And so now it only exists in your memories, or in the picture.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,180
Sometimes the account posts images of pools or cisterns or other aquatic places.

15
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,620
These also come in the two main flavors, dark and unsettling, or pristine and comforting.

16
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,200
Even in the comforting ones, though, there's a sense of loneliness or loss.

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
No, not that kind of loss.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,880
Sometimes the account posts pictures of evidence of human activity that has since gone dormant,

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,800
like something that is out of season or a location after closing, again in those two

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
main flavors.

21
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,080
Related to this one are pictures of cities and towns that are clearly still in use, but

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,720
from a weird angle or location or time of day.

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,600
In this case, people would normally be there here and now in the present day, but because

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,940
the picture is taken in the middle of a snowstorm or at 3am or something, no one's there.

25
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,500
What each of these different types of photo have in common is that they evoke liminal

26
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,660
feelings, the experience of being neither here nor there, of being in between places,

27
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,740
stuck out of time, falling through the cracks, that sort of thing.

28
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,360
Liminality began as an anthropological term, initially referring to the feeling of ambiguity

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,660
or disorientation that occurs in the middle stage of a rite of passage, where the rite's

30
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,720
participants no longer hold their pre-ritual status, but have not yet begun the transition

31
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,900
to the status they will hold when the rite is complete.

32
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,640
During a rite's liminal stage, participants stand at the threshold of the previous way

33
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,760
of structuring their identity, time, or community, and a new way which completing the rite establishes.

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,520
Or at least that's what the Wikipedia page says.

35
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,520
This makes a lot of sense to me.

36
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,800
Here's an experience that I had, and I think is relatively common, you can probably relate.

37
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,480
You had a part-time job in high school, right?

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,560
Maybe you could only work evenings and weekends because of school, that's pretty normal.

39
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,520
But then when summer break started, suddenly you were able to work different hours during

40
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,720
the weekday if you wanted.

41
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,860
You still held the identity of high school student, but you were working more like an

42
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,720
adult would in that same position.

43
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,820
And then when fall rolled around, you were back to that student's schedule.

44
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,020
This absolutely describes my part-time experience growing up.

45
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,180
Now think to that final summer before you went off to university.

46
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,720
You graduate high school, you're no longer a high school student.

47
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,540
The school building itself, its staff, its routines, and rituals are now cut off to you.

48
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,680
But you're still working that same high school job.

49
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,940
It's no longer a summer break in the same sense.

50
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,260
Maybe you're quitting the job at the end of the summer to move to another city to go

51
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,260
to school.

52
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,100
Maybe you're staying there and just transitioning to working as a normal adult.

53
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,500
Maybe you're going to university in the same city, and you can hold onto your job

54
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
for a few more years with a modified schedule.

55
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,760
But that final summer feels unique.

56
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,860
It feels like you're in between the identities of high school student and university student.

57
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,660
And I certainly felt that way looking back.

58
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,140
I didn't quite know what life held in store for me next.

59
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,500
I was in the process of shedding my high school life, but that job was one part of that life

60
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,180
that didn't go at graduation.

61
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,680
So in a way, I felt in limbo for that summer.

62
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,900
Arnold van Genep in his 1909 work, Rites of Passage, examined the various rites of passage

63
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,940
found within small-scale societies.

64
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,780
And this is where he first coined the term liminality to refer to that in-between period.

65
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,420
Previous practices and routines must be broken with a metaphorical death.

66
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,860
The rite must be a strict set of actions guided by a master of ceremonies.

67
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,220
The rite being simultaneously rigid and destructive is what allows for significant changes of

68
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,720
the initiate's identity.

69
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,360
After crossing the liminal threshold, the initiate reintegrates into society with a

70
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,340
new identity as a new person.

71
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,580
It's not hard to see these steps represented.

72
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,500
Not only in various primitive or prehistoric rites of passage, but also in their modern

73
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
equivalents.

74
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,540
Marriage, the process by which an outsider is brought into the family.

75
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,700
Graduation, the process by which you move from student to alumni.

76
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,860
Birthdays, New Year celebrations, promotions at work, leaving a workplace, moving out of

77
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,860
an apartment.

78
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,260
They all work roughly like this, more or less.

79
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,900
Even in the least serious events, like when you're watching the clock tick down to midnight

80
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,440
for New Year's, there's that single second of apprehension, of realization when the threshold

81
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
is crossed.

82
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,980
That feeling is liminality.

83
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,980
And these pictures seem to capture that feeling.

84
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,580
You can feel it when you look at them.

85
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,580
This is a space that's kind of off the map.

86
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,780
It's an in-between.

87
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,300
It's not explicitly spooky, like you shouldn't be here, that you're not welcome.

88
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,860
It's more like nobody's been here for a very long time.

89
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,940
And isn't that exact what the past is?

90
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,020
Somewhere where no one's been for a very long time?

91
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,420
You can get some of these same feelings if you check out screenshots of old video games

92
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,420
too.

93
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,900
Especially if they're games that you loved to death when you were growing up.

94
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,940
Games that you had totally gone beyond just beating, but you mastered them.

95
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,020
100% of them.

96
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,060
Some participated in online fandoms about them.

97
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,100
But even then, how long has it been since you actually played them?

98
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,940
Metroid Prime is one of my favorite games.

99
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,380
I regularly identify it as being on the list of favorite games, and yet, I haven't picked

100
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,380
up in over 10 years.

101
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,340
How long has it been since you played Half-Life, or System Shock, or Morrowind, or Mario 64?

102
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,660
Even as you stopped engaging with the thing, the feelings remained, and you didn't even

103
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,480
notice as the past began to recede.

104
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,020
Liminality is part of the reason why so many things right now are nostalgia bait.

105
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,820
How many old franchises have we seen that have been revived?

106
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,020
Butchered, yes.

107
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,580
But even the rare moment that they're done well, they still evoke this feeling.

108
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,580
How many indie games are coming out that try to look like Super Nintendo games?

109
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,260
Only not really, but how your child's eye remembers the SNES looking.

110
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,260
Or PlayStation 1 games now too.

111
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,180
Nostalgia can be fun, but I think the amount that we indulge in it can be unhealthy.

112
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,760
Even if all the legitimately new stuff people are making right now sucks.

113
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,400
Nostalgia is often used as a tool by people who want to elevate the good old days into

114
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,940
a product that they can sell you.

115
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,060
You can't buy back your childhood, no matter how hard you try.

116
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,700
And yet, nostalgia and liminality are related, but not the same.

117
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,580
To use liminality's terminology, nostalgia is the feeling after you've gone through

118
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,460
the rite of passage, while thinking back fondly about the old you from before.

119
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,060
That's not quite liminality.

120
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,700
It's normal to think back on a previous era of your life and say, yeah, we got up

121
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,700
to some shit, didn't we?

122
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,780
That was a good time.

123
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,680
But it's not normal to obsess over it, to want to desperately go back.

124
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,580
In fact, it's this tendency that I've seen leftoids online say that it's a major

125
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,200
driver for millennials today to become fascists because nostalgia is a gateway to reactionary

126
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
thinking.

127
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
But this isn't that kind of video.

128
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,000
Also, that's a retarded idea.

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,400
Within the past month or so, I had to return to my hometown to visit my parents.

130
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,000
My dad and I worked on the car that Naomi and I had just bought.

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,960
I can't do that kind of work here, but my parents' place is more equipped for it.

132
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,360
My parents also needed some help with moving some furniture and a few other jobs that it's

133
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,100
nice to have a young person around for.

134
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,300
My parents are certainly getting older, and every time I see them, they look more and

135
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,260
more dissimilar from what they look like in my head, which is still an image of them

136
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,340
from what I think are my teenage years.

137
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,160
It sounds strange to say, but sometimes you forget that time isn't only marching on

138
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,120
in places that you pay attention to.

139
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,300
A lot of the businesses in my hometown have closed down.

140
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,060
The buildings are boarded up and abandoned.

141
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,060
About one third of my school year never left town.

142
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,660
Another third left and came back.

143
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,020
Some have started families.

144
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,020
Some have become drug addicts.

145
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,460
There's a lot more heroin in the town than there used to be.

146
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,500
There's no local economy or opportunity in these small towns anymore, and it's not

147
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,060
all just COVID-related either.

148
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,860
I went for a walk through the forest that my friends and I used to hang out in as kids.

149
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,980
A bridge across a creek that a friend of a friend's family built was still there, but

150
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,180
it was beginning to rust and hadn't been kept up.

151
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,700
The old trails were still roughly in the same place, but the amount of overgrowth had drastically

152
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,700
changed.

153
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,700
Not surprising.

154
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,900
It had been 20 years since I went back there.

155
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,220
I wanted to show Naomi an abandoned house in the woods that Dave and I and other kids

156
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,900
would hang out in, but we hiked back far enough to discover that all the land had been cleared

157
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,900
out.

158
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,780
I planned to develop it eventually, but the building was gone, and the only thing left

159
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,180
of the trees were just large stacks of logs.

160
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,860
The town feels a lot emptier than it used to, and I don't just mean because of the

161
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,340
old ghosts of people who don't exist anymore.

162
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,340
Not really.

163
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,180
You're not the you you used to be, floating around in my mind anytime I went to a location

164
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,180
that triggered a memory.

165
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,180
And that was pretty much every location.

166
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,500
No, the town is also just emptier.

167
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Less people there in total.

168
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,520
When I was a kid, during summer you could expect to see people walking around.

169
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,140
Even there, despite its small size.

170
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,620
There were regular summer festivals at the local ballpark.

171
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,360
There were playgrounds for kids to play on.

172
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,440
But now the town is largely dead, and a lot of that infrastructure is just decaying.

173
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,520
It's one of those places that time truly has left behind.

174
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,040
Naomi was even surprised that the local grocery store still uses rollers instead of conveyor

175
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
belts.

176
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,080
While I was there I had to get some old stuff from my parents place.

177
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,440
It was getting to the point where, if I didn't get it now I wouldn't be getting it at all.

178
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
And fair enough.

179
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,200
I've been gone long enough that my parents didn't want to hang on to it anymore.

180
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,200
It was largely junk, which is why I didn't take it with me when I moved out in the first

181
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
place.

182
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,440
Some stuff that I kept, either for nostalgia, or because it had actual value, like for example

183
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,920
my old Pokemon card collection.

184
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,480
I also discovered a pile of counterfeit DVDs.

185
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,900
I actually ran a side hustle in school, back when DVD burners were rare as fuck, and nobody

186
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,040
knew how to use computers.

187
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,520
I burned anime shows and TV shows to DVD, and sold them to kids out of my locker.

188
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,480
I even turned online wallpapers into fancy jewel case inserts.

189
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,900
You can even see lines from my family's failing inkjet printer.

190
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,720
I turned a pretty good profit on these.

191
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,480
But eventually they stopped selling, and the excess went into the back of a closet somewhere.

192
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,480
Also among the pile of stuff that was mine was a box of old school work from when I was

193
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
a child.

194
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,960
I remember school being exceptionally easy.

195
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,040
I never did homework, and when homework started counting towards grades, I always managed

196
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,700
to finish it before leaving school.

197
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,740
As I got older, I skipped school a fair bit to play video games.

198
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,160
And frankly, I think I learned more from video games than school.

199
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,600
Calculating out level ups or percentage chances to hit or whatever in an RPG had me caring

200
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,400
about math way more than anything I got out of a classroom.

201
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,080
And I certainly learned more about ethics from video games than I did reading pre-teen

202
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
novels too.

203
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,180
When I was at school, I would spend more time doodling than doing work.

204
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,940
Not because I was slacking, but because I finished the work really quickly.

205
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:36,220
Despite my total lack of care, I managed to get perfect or near perfect on everything

206
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,220
until I hit high school.

207
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,660
And in high school, getting regular 90s was not an issue.

208
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,060
I remember thinking when I was very young how stupid the other kids were, because what

209
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,060
the fuck, this stuff was easy guys.

210
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,060
How are you getting low marks?

211
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,040
But I learned very quickly to keep that view and my marks to myself if I wanted to keep

212
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
any friends.

213
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,740
And I remember valuing those friends very highly, even though the only one that I still

214
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,900
talked to was Dave.

215
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,620
I was offered the chance to skip ahead in grades on three separate occasions, though

216
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,180
I turned them all down for my friends.

217
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,100
If I had it all to do again I'd take the skip, if only to get out of school faster

218
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,420
those friends ended up not mattering.

219
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,100
I also got a participation award, yeah I wasn't an athlete in grade school, but I did legitimately

220
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,340
come athletic in high school.

221
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,180
However I had a pretty radical shift in my life from sixteen until graduation that caused

222
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,700
me to stop pursuing athletics and most other things.

223
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,700
And during that time I had some insomnia.

224
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,260
Even this though I have fond memories of, staying up late into the night playing video

225
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,820
games or watching shitty kung fu movies at like 3am where the entire town was asleep,

226
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,780
everything was dark, and the only light source is the blue of the TV.

227
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,500
It was, in a way, liminal.

228
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,160
This entire side conversation so far has been like 90% nostalgia.

229
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,180
And it probably sounds like me just wanking off all over you and wasting your time.

230
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,380
Well maybe, but there's actually something here that should tie it back around.

231
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,780
I've often felt that, in a way, I've existed in a liminal space for most of my adult life.

232
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,540
And I don't necessarily mean that negatively, I'm not suffering, I actually love my life.

233
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,620
But after talking with Naomi about it while wandering around the woods, I've come to

234
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,060
realize that my life has a remarkable lack of closure, all things considered.

235
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,100
There's a lot of normal things that people do, markers of life, transitions between eras

236
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,380
and your journey growing up, that I didn't do.

237
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,800
And I remember exactly why I skipped them all.

238
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,580
Because one, my parents forced me to do them when I didn't want to, so when I could get

239
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,860
away with skipping I would.

240
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,140
And two, because my engagement with the system was, for the most part, a gigantic waste of

241
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,140
time.

242
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,620
I always felt like I was never learning anything at school I hadn't already mastered.

243
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,040
I was being told to sit at a desk, to learn math and spelling I already knew, to read

244
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,920
books I had grown out of years earlier, to follow rules that were arbitrarily stupid,

245
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,300
and to hang out with kids I hated, but I had no other option for socialization because

246
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,260
it's a small town, so the best you get is the kid who's an asshole but also likes the

247
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,380
same kind of cookies that you do, and so there's your friendship.

248
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,880
So like I said, when I could skip, I would.

249
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,620
I was always the last one to get photos taken for my parents to buy.

250
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,740
You know, you have to take that big permission envelope home, and then you're told to dress

251
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,980
up that day at school, and then you can order wallet sized or whatever.

252
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,740
I wanted to skip my grade school graduation, but I wasn't allowed.

253
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,000
Same with high school, though the minute I had that diploma in hand I was at the door.

254
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,100
There was no way I was staying for the rest of the ceremony after my parents got the picture

255
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,100
they wanted.

256
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,760
But I did skip my high school prom.

257
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,780
I spent that night playing Tales of Symphonia on the GameCube.

258
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,780
Great game, totally worth it.

259
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,620
During my last year of high school, in fact, I took on a job as the yearbook editor, and

260
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,380
went on to create the worst yearbook the school had seen in 50 years.

261
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,780
Only because the job gave me my own private office, and me and some friends carried up

262
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,820
a couch and hooked up my GameCube to one of those TVs on carts, and we spent the final

263
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,460
year of school playing Smash Brothers and skipping class.

264
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,060
I skipped my university graduation too, didn't care, and I could at that point.

265
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,620
And my most serious relationship, besides Naomi, never officially ended either.

266
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,800
That's too long of a story to get into right now, but the circumstances were such that

267
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,420
I had moved out without ever having that final we're done conversation.

268
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,620
Same with a lot of the friends I didn't like.

269
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,700
There was never a big blowout fight, there was never a reconciliation, there was never

270
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,780
a goodbye, I just left school and didn't look back.

271
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,180
I never really left a job on a bad note either, but most of the times I've moved on.

272
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,680
It always lacked a definitive feeling of moving on, like if it was seasonal work it always

273
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,780
ended on a see you next year kind of thing.

274
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,060
In fact, one business closed down while I was on vacation.

275
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,300
My life is full of stuff like this, where eras of my life never actually ended, they

276
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,300
just faded.

277
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,340
Naomi pointed out that my negative, not actively or violently negative, but more like boring

278
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,820
and time-wasting negative, engagement with most of the normal institutions during, say,

279
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,140
the first 15 years of life, likely caused me to develop an opt-out personality.

280
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,900
If I can skip out and do my own thing, I will, and the easiest things to skip out on are

281
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,520
those formal rites of passage.

282
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,720
You still legally have the diploma even if you don't physically go through the ritual

283
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,500
of wearing the robe and going up and shaking the hand and then sticking around for the

284
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,700
speeches and all the rest of it.

285
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,860
You don't have to go to your graduation.

286
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,100
And looking back on it, I've left a lot of what many people consider to be the most important

287
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,280
moments in a liminal state.

288
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,940
Sometimes I couldn't get closure like with the ex-girlfriend, sometimes I actively avoided

289
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,540
it, but the result is the same.

290
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,700
In all practical ways, I have very little in my past left undone.

291
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,460
But sometimes it doesn't feel like it.

292
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,820
And being a YouTuber seems to be the ultimate liminal job.

293
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,380
I know you guys watch me, I know that you're there, but physically it's just me and the

294
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,380
mic.

295
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,380
I'm by myself.

296
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,580
I think there's liminality inherent in working from home, where the division between home

297
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,140
time and work time is blurred.

298
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,620
I kind of like it that way.

299
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,460
It feels like an ideal zone to be in, to do some writing or reading for example, to be

300
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,620
constantly on the cusp of a transformative process.

301
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,300
But it also has its problems.

302
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,120
Just like how I might enjoy how liminal certain parts of my life has been, there are still

303
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,640
problems related to closure.

304
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,180
And I can induce all of these feelings just by looking at a liminal image.

305
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,300
That being said, this video shouldn't be taken as some kind of nihilistic millennial screed,

306
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,860
nor should anybody really worry about me.

307
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,060
Naomi was right about my opt-out personality, but only half right.

308
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,900
A lot of millennials who are nihilistic and who opt-out, even my contemporaries at school,

309
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,620
did so to get drunk or high or to fuck around with girls.

310
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,620
I didn't.

311
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,080
I spent a lot of time playing video games, yeah.

312
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,720
But I eventually moved on to coding my own video games, or trying to write novels with

313
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,880
every spare moment that I could get.

314
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,160
In fact, I still think I have some of those old projects.

315
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,040
Also in that box of junk, there was my old card game.

316
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,960
Yeah, I got frustrated with Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh and ended up making my own game.

317
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,320
It was full of memes and garbage, but I had fun making it.

318
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,600
I had fun making my own rules, and my friends and I had a lot of fun playing it.

319
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,240
I remember being a kid and hearing them be amazed, saying they could never think of making

320
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
their own game.

321
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,600
And I was just there thinking, how could you not?

322
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,320
As an adult, I recognize what that opt-out impulse is.

323
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,520
I didn't spend my youth rejecting normal institutions and losing out on the meaning found within

324
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,440
them, though for a long time I thought that's what was going on with me.

325
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,960
What was actually happening was, I was searching for alternative paths of meaning, because

326
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,760
the normal ones weren't cutting it.

327
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,020
And where possible, I was making my own.

328
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,920
I think that's why I want to run my own business and be my own boss, and why I find working

329
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,900
under other people to be absolutely hellish.

330
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,560
And that's what I appreciate about Luminal Spaces.

331
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,440
That's what I feel when I'm there.

332
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,000
Some people feel scared because of their unsettling nature.

333
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,560
Some people feel comforted, reminded of a good moment in their past.

334
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,160
I've felt both of those things too.

335
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,600
But most of the time I feel energized, like this is the zone.

336
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,640
There was no way for me to do this video without sounding like I am up my own ass because I

337
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,200
know my experiences aren't common, and I also know looking back that I was kind of a smarter

338
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,280
than average child.

339
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,400
That reception is unavoidable, so I've just made my peace with it.

340
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,400
I don't actually view myself as better than anybody else, especially not as an adult.

341
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
I'm just different.

342
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,380
And also I know this isn't a political video, it's just a topic that I wanted to talk about

343
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,380
for a bit.

344
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,360
We will return to your scheduled politics content tomorrow.

345
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
All right, that does it for me.

346
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
Have a good one, guys.

347
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,360
I love you.
