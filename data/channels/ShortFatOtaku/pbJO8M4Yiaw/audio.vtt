Hey, you know that Twitter account Liminal Spaces, or, uh, Space Liminal Bot, if you

00:10.440 --> 00:11.440
want to go by the handle?

00:11.440 --> 00:15.920
It's kinda unique in that it posts images of, well, what it calls liminal spaces.

00:15.920 --> 00:20.040
Sometimes these are pictures of long hallways, dilapidated and dark, or perfectly normal

00:20.040 --> 00:23.920
and well-lit, or appearing like it's a place out of time, like it's still a functioning

00:23.920 --> 00:27.600
location just with an older aesthetic style, like the decor hasn't been updated since

00:27.600 --> 00:28.600
the 80s.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.400
These pictures can sometimes generate a sense of unease, almost like there's something

00:31.400 --> 00:34.560
way down at the end of the hallway that's coming for you, but they can also generate

00:34.560 --> 00:38.600
a feeling of comfort sometimes, like a place that you used to visit but no longer can because

00:38.600 --> 00:39.600
it's gone.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.240
Maybe it's been renovated, maybe it's been torn down, whatever.

00:41.240 --> 00:45.960
And so now it only exists in your memories, or in the picture.

00:45.960 --> 00:50.180
Sometimes the account posts images of pools or cisterns or other aquatic places.

00:50.180 --> 00:54.620
These also come in the two main flavors, dark and unsettling, or pristine and comforting.

00:54.620 --> 00:58.200
Even in the comforting ones, though, there's a sense of loneliness or loss.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.600
No, not that kind of loss.

01:00.600 --> 01:04.880
Sometimes the account posts pictures of evidence of human activity that has since gone dormant,

01:04.880 --> 01:08.800
like something that is out of season or a location after closing, again in those two

01:08.800 --> 01:09.800
main flavors.

01:09.800 --> 01:13.080
Related to this one are pictures of cities and towns that are clearly still in use, but

01:13.080 --> 01:15.720
from a weird angle or location or time of day.

01:15.720 --> 01:19.600
In this case, people would normally be there here and now in the present day, but because

01:19.600 --> 01:23.940
the picture is taken in the middle of a snowstorm or at 3am or something, no one's there.

01:23.940 --> 01:27.500
What each of these different types of photo have in common is that they evoke liminal

01:27.500 --> 01:32.660
feelings, the experience of being neither here nor there, of being in between places,

01:32.660 --> 01:35.740
stuck out of time, falling through the cracks, that sort of thing.

01:35.740 --> 01:39.360
Liminality began as an anthropological term, initially referring to the feeling of ambiguity

01:39.360 --> 01:43.660
or disorientation that occurs in the middle stage of a rite of passage, where the rite's

01:43.660 --> 01:47.720
participants no longer hold their pre-ritual status, but have not yet begun the transition

01:47.720 --> 01:49.900
to the status they will hold when the rite is complete.

01:49.900 --> 01:53.640
During a rite's liminal stage, participants stand at the threshold of the previous way

01:53.640 --> 01:58.760
of structuring their identity, time, or community, and a new way which completing the rite establishes.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.520
Or at least that's what the Wikipedia page says.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.520
This makes a lot of sense to me.

02:01.520 --> 02:04.800
Here's an experience that I had, and I think is relatively common, you can probably relate.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.480
You had a part-time job in high school, right?

02:06.480 --> 02:09.560
Maybe you could only work evenings and weekends because of school, that's pretty normal.

02:09.560 --> 02:12.520
But then when summer break started, suddenly you were able to work different hours during

02:12.520 --> 02:13.720
the weekday if you wanted.

02:13.720 --> 02:16.860
You still held the identity of high school student, but you were working more like an

02:16.860 --> 02:18.720
adult would in that same position.

02:18.720 --> 02:21.820
And then when fall rolled around, you were back to that student's schedule.

02:21.820 --> 02:24.020
This absolutely describes my part-time experience growing up.

02:24.020 --> 02:27.180
Now think to that final summer before you went off to university.

02:27.180 --> 02:29.720
You graduate high school, you're no longer a high school student.

02:29.720 --> 02:34.540
The school building itself, its staff, its routines, and rituals are now cut off to you.

02:34.540 --> 02:36.680
But you're still working that same high school job.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.940
It's no longer a summer break in the same sense.

02:38.940 --> 02:41.260
Maybe you're quitting the job at the end of the summer to move to another city to go

02:41.260 --> 02:42.260
to school.

02:42.260 --> 02:45.100
Maybe you're staying there and just transitioning to working as a normal adult.

02:45.100 --> 02:48.500
Maybe you're going to university in the same city, and you can hold onto your job

02:48.500 --> 02:50.500
for a few more years with a modified schedule.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.760
But that final summer feels unique.

02:52.760 --> 02:56.860
It feels like you're in between the identities of high school student and university student.

02:56.860 --> 02:58.660
And I certainly felt that way looking back.

02:58.660 --> 03:01.140
I didn't quite know what life held in store for me next.

03:01.140 --> 03:05.500
I was in the process of shedding my high school life, but that job was one part of that life

03:05.500 --> 03:07.180
that didn't go at graduation.

03:07.180 --> 03:09.680
So in a way, I felt in limbo for that summer.

03:09.680 --> 03:14.900
Arnold van Genep in his 1909 work, Rites of Passage, examined the various rites of passage

03:14.900 --> 03:16.940
found within small-scale societies.

03:16.940 --> 03:21.780
And this is where he first coined the term liminality to refer to that in-between period.

03:21.780 --> 03:25.420
Previous practices and routines must be broken with a metaphorical death.

03:25.420 --> 03:29.860
The rite must be a strict set of actions guided by a master of ceremonies.

03:29.860 --> 03:35.220
The rite being simultaneously rigid and destructive is what allows for significant changes of

03:35.220 --> 03:36.720
the initiate's identity.

03:36.720 --> 03:40.360
After crossing the liminal threshold, the initiate reintegrates into society with a

03:40.360 --> 03:42.340
new identity as a new person.

03:42.340 --> 03:44.580
It's not hard to see these steps represented.

03:44.580 --> 03:48.500
Not only in various primitive or prehistoric rites of passage, but also in their modern

03:48.500 --> 03:49.500
equivalents.

03:49.500 --> 03:52.540
Marriage, the process by which an outsider is brought into the family.

03:52.540 --> 03:55.700
Graduation, the process by which you move from student to alumni.

03:55.700 --> 03:59.860
Birthdays, New Year celebrations, promotions at work, leaving a workplace, moving out of

03:59.860 --> 04:00.860
an apartment.

04:00.860 --> 04:03.260
They all work roughly like this, more or less.

04:03.260 --> 04:06.900
Even in the least serious events, like when you're watching the clock tick down to midnight

04:06.900 --> 04:11.440
for New Year's, there's that single second of apprehension, of realization when the threshold

04:11.440 --> 04:12.440
is crossed.

04:12.440 --> 04:13.980
That feeling is liminality.

04:13.980 --> 04:15.980
And these pictures seem to capture that feeling.

04:15.980 --> 04:17.580
You can feel it when you look at them.

04:17.580 --> 04:19.580
This is a space that's kind of off the map.

04:19.580 --> 04:20.780
It's an in-between.

04:20.780 --> 04:24.300
It's not explicitly spooky, like you shouldn't be here, that you're not welcome.

04:24.300 --> 04:27.860
It's more like nobody's been here for a very long time.

04:27.860 --> 04:29.940
And isn't that exact what the past is?

04:29.940 --> 04:32.020
Somewhere where no one's been for a very long time?

04:32.020 --> 04:35.420
You can get some of these same feelings if you check out screenshots of old video games

04:35.420 --> 04:36.420
too.

04:36.420 --> 04:38.900
Especially if they're games that you loved to death when you were growing up.

04:38.900 --> 04:41.940
Games that you had totally gone beyond just beating, but you mastered them.

04:41.940 --> 04:43.020
100% of them.

04:43.060 --> 04:45.060
Some participated in online fandoms about them.

04:45.060 --> 04:48.100
But even then, how long has it been since you actually played them?

04:48.100 --> 04:49.940
Metroid Prime is one of my favorite games.

04:49.940 --> 04:54.380
I regularly identify it as being on the list of favorite games, and yet, I haven't picked

04:54.380 --> 04:55.380
up in over 10 years.

04:55.380 --> 05:00.340
How long has it been since you played Half-Life, or System Shock, or Morrowind, or Mario 64?

05:00.340 --> 05:04.660
Even as you stopped engaging with the thing, the feelings remained, and you didn't even

05:04.660 --> 05:07.480
notice as the past began to recede.

05:07.480 --> 05:11.020
Liminality is part of the reason why so many things right now are nostalgia bait.

05:11.020 --> 05:13.820
How many old franchises have we seen that have been revived?

05:13.820 --> 05:15.020
Butchered, yes.

05:15.020 --> 05:18.580
But even the rare moment that they're done well, they still evoke this feeling.

05:18.580 --> 05:21.580
How many indie games are coming out that try to look like Super Nintendo games?

05:21.580 --> 05:25.260
Only not really, but how your child's eye remembers the SNES looking.

05:25.260 --> 05:27.260
Or PlayStation 1 games now too.

05:27.260 --> 05:31.180
Nostalgia can be fun, but I think the amount that we indulge in it can be unhealthy.

05:31.180 --> 05:34.760
Even if all the legitimately new stuff people are making right now sucks.

05:34.760 --> 05:38.400
Nostalgia is often used as a tool by people who want to elevate the good old days into

05:38.400 --> 05:39.940
a product that they can sell you.

05:39.940 --> 05:43.060
You can't buy back your childhood, no matter how hard you try.

05:43.060 --> 05:46.700
And yet, nostalgia and liminality are related, but not the same.

05:46.700 --> 05:50.580
To use liminality's terminology, nostalgia is the feeling after you've gone through

05:50.580 --> 05:54.460
the rite of passage, while thinking back fondly about the old you from before.

05:54.460 --> 05:56.060
That's not quite liminality.

05:56.060 --> 05:59.700
It's normal to think back on a previous era of your life and say, yeah, we got up

05:59.700 --> 06:00.700
to some shit, didn't we?

06:00.700 --> 06:01.780
That was a good time.

06:01.780 --> 06:05.680
But it's not normal to obsess over it, to want to desperately go back.

06:05.680 --> 06:09.580
In fact, it's this tendency that I've seen leftoids online say that it's a major

06:09.580 --> 06:14.200
driver for millennials today to become fascists because nostalgia is a gateway to reactionary

06:14.200 --> 06:15.200
thinking.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.200
But this isn't that kind of video.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.000
Also, that's a retarded idea.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.400
Within the past month or so, I had to return to my hometown to visit my parents.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.000
My dad and I worked on the car that Naomi and I had just bought.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.960
I can't do that kind of work here, but my parents' place is more equipped for it.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.360
My parents also needed some help with moving some furniture and a few other jobs that it's

06:30.360 --> 06:32.100
nice to have a young person around for.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.300
My parents are certainly getting older, and every time I see them, they look more and

06:35.300 --> 06:38.260
more dissimilar from what they look like in my head, which is still an image of them

06:38.260 --> 06:40.340
from what I think are my teenage years.

06:40.340 --> 06:44.160
It sounds strange to say, but sometimes you forget that time isn't only marching on

06:44.160 --> 06:46.120
in places that you pay attention to.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.300
A lot of the businesses in my hometown have closed down.

06:48.300 --> 06:50.060
The buildings are boarded up and abandoned.

06:50.060 --> 06:52.060
About one third of my school year never left town.

06:52.060 --> 06:53.660
Another third left and came back.

06:53.660 --> 06:55.020
Some have started families.

06:55.020 --> 06:56.020
Some have become drug addicts.

06:56.020 --> 06:58.460
There's a lot more heroin in the town than there used to be.

06:58.460 --> 07:02.500
There's no local economy or opportunity in these small towns anymore, and it's not

07:02.500 --> 07:04.060
all just COVID-related either.

07:04.060 --> 07:07.860
I went for a walk through the forest that my friends and I used to hang out in as kids.

07:07.860 --> 07:11.980
A bridge across a creek that a friend of a friend's family built was still there, but

07:11.980 --> 07:14.180
it was beginning to rust and hadn't been kept up.

07:14.180 --> 07:18.700
The old trails were still roughly in the same place, but the amount of overgrowth had drastically

07:18.700 --> 07:19.700
changed.

07:19.700 --> 07:20.700
Not surprising.

07:20.700 --> 07:21.900
It had been 20 years since I went back there.

07:21.900 --> 07:26.220
I wanted to show Naomi an abandoned house in the woods that Dave and I and other kids

07:26.220 --> 07:30.900
would hang out in, but we hiked back far enough to discover that all the land had been cleared

07:30.900 --> 07:31.900
out.

07:31.900 --> 07:34.780
I planned to develop it eventually, but the building was gone, and the only thing left

07:34.780 --> 07:37.180
of the trees were just large stacks of logs.

07:37.180 --> 07:39.860
The town feels a lot emptier than it used to, and I don't just mean because of the

07:39.860 --> 07:42.340
old ghosts of people who don't exist anymore.

07:42.340 --> 07:43.340
Not really.

07:43.340 --> 07:46.180
You're not the you you used to be, floating around in my mind anytime I went to a location

07:46.180 --> 07:47.180
that triggered a memory.

07:47.180 --> 07:48.180
And that was pretty much every location.

07:48.180 --> 07:50.500
No, the town is also just emptier.

07:50.500 --> 07:51.500
Less people there in total.

07:51.500 --> 07:54.520
When I was a kid, during summer you could expect to see people walking around.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.140
Even there, despite its small size.

07:56.140 --> 07:58.620
There were regular summer festivals at the local ballpark.

07:58.620 --> 08:00.360
There were playgrounds for kids to play on.

08:00.360 --> 08:04.440
But now the town is largely dead, and a lot of that infrastructure is just decaying.

08:04.440 --> 08:07.520
It's one of those places that time truly has left behind.

08:07.520 --> 08:11.040
Naomi was even surprised that the local grocery store still uses rollers instead of conveyor

08:11.040 --> 08:12.040
belts.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.080
While I was there I had to get some old stuff from my parents place.

08:14.080 --> 08:17.440
It was getting to the point where, if I didn't get it now I wouldn't be getting it at all.

08:17.440 --> 08:18.440
And fair enough.

08:18.440 --> 08:21.200
I've been gone long enough that my parents didn't want to hang on to it anymore.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.200
It was largely junk, which is why I didn't take it with me when I moved out in the first

08:24.200 --> 08:25.200
place.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.440
Some stuff that I kept, either for nostalgia, or because it had actual value, like for example

08:28.440 --> 08:29.920
my old Pokemon card collection.

08:30.480 --> 08:32.480
I also discovered a pile of counterfeit DVDs.

08:32.480 --> 08:36.900
I actually ran a side hustle in school, back when DVD burners were rare as fuck, and nobody

08:36.900 --> 08:38.040
knew how to use computers.

08:38.040 --> 08:42.520
I burned anime shows and TV shows to DVD, and sold them to kids out of my locker.

08:42.520 --> 08:46.480
I even turned online wallpapers into fancy jewel case inserts.

08:46.480 --> 08:49.900
You can even see lines from my family's failing inkjet printer.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.720
I turned a pretty good profit on these.

08:51.720 --> 08:55.480
But eventually they stopped selling, and the excess went into the back of a closet somewhere.

08:55.480 --> 08:58.480
Also among the pile of stuff that was mine was a box of old school work from when I was

08:58.480 --> 08:59.480
a child.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.960
I remember school being exceptionally easy.

09:01.960 --> 09:06.040
I never did homework, and when homework started counting towards grades, I always managed

09:06.040 --> 09:07.700
to finish it before leaving school.

09:07.700 --> 09:10.740
As I got older, I skipped school a fair bit to play video games.

09:10.740 --> 09:13.160
And frankly, I think I learned more from video games than school.

09:13.160 --> 09:17.600
Calculating out level ups or percentage chances to hit or whatever in an RPG had me caring

09:17.600 --> 09:20.400
about math way more than anything I got out of a classroom.

09:20.400 --> 09:24.080
And I certainly learned more about ethics from video games than I did reading pre-teen

09:24.080 --> 09:25.080
novels too.

09:25.080 --> 09:28.180
When I was at school, I would spend more time doodling than doing work.

09:28.180 --> 09:30.940
Not because I was slacking, but because I finished the work really quickly.

09:30.940 --> 09:36.220
Despite my total lack of care, I managed to get perfect or near perfect on everything

09:36.220 --> 09:37.220
until I hit high school.

09:37.220 --> 09:39.660
And in high school, getting regular 90s was not an issue.

09:39.660 --> 09:43.060
I remember thinking when I was very young how stupid the other kids were, because what

09:43.060 --> 09:45.060
the fuck, this stuff was easy guys.

09:45.060 --> 09:46.060
How are you getting low marks?

09:46.060 --> 09:50.040
But I learned very quickly to keep that view and my marks to myself if I wanted to keep

09:50.040 --> 09:51.040
any friends.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.740
And I remember valuing those friends very highly, even though the only one that I still

09:53.740 --> 09:54.900
talked to was Dave.

09:54.900 --> 09:58.620
I was offered the chance to skip ahead in grades on three separate occasions, though

09:58.620 --> 10:00.180
I turned them all down for my friends.

10:00.180 --> 10:03.100
If I had it all to do again I'd take the skip, if only to get out of school faster

10:03.100 --> 10:04.420
those friends ended up not mattering.

10:04.420 --> 10:09.100
I also got a participation award, yeah I wasn't an athlete in grade school, but I did legitimately

10:09.100 --> 10:10.340
come athletic in high school.

10:10.340 --> 10:14.180
However I had a pretty radical shift in my life from sixteen until graduation that caused

10:14.180 --> 10:16.700
me to stop pursuing athletics and most other things.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.700
And during that time I had some insomnia.

10:18.700 --> 10:22.260
Even this though I have fond memories of, staying up late into the night playing video

10:22.260 --> 10:26.820
games or watching shitty kung fu movies at like 3am where the entire town was asleep,

10:26.820 --> 10:29.780
everything was dark, and the only light source is the blue of the TV.

10:29.780 --> 10:31.500
It was, in a way, liminal.

10:31.500 --> 10:35.160
This entire side conversation so far has been like 90% nostalgia.

10:35.160 --> 10:39.180
And it probably sounds like me just wanking off all over you and wasting your time.

10:39.180 --> 10:42.380
Well maybe, but there's actually something here that should tie it back around.

10:42.380 --> 10:46.780
I've often felt that, in a way, I've existed in a liminal space for most of my adult life.

10:46.780 --> 10:50.540
And I don't necessarily mean that negatively, I'm not suffering, I actually love my life.

10:50.540 --> 10:53.620
But after talking with Naomi about it while wandering around the woods, I've come to

10:53.620 --> 10:57.060
realize that my life has a remarkable lack of closure, all things considered.

10:57.060 --> 11:01.100
There's a lot of normal things that people do, markers of life, transitions between eras

11:01.100 --> 11:03.380
and your journey growing up, that I didn't do.

11:03.380 --> 11:05.800
And I remember exactly why I skipped them all.

11:05.800 --> 11:09.580
Because one, my parents forced me to do them when I didn't want to, so when I could get

11:09.580 --> 11:10.860
away with skipping I would.

11:10.860 --> 11:15.140
And two, because my engagement with the system was, for the most part, a gigantic waste of

11:15.140 --> 11:16.140
time.

11:16.140 --> 11:18.620
I always felt like I was never learning anything at school I hadn't already mastered.

11:18.620 --> 11:22.040
I was being told to sit at a desk, to learn math and spelling I already knew, to read

11:22.040 --> 11:25.920
books I had grown out of years earlier, to follow rules that were arbitrarily stupid,

11:25.920 --> 11:29.300
and to hang out with kids I hated, but I had no other option for socialization because

11:29.300 --> 11:32.260
it's a small town, so the best you get is the kid who's an asshole but also likes the

11:32.260 --> 11:34.380
same kind of cookies that you do, and so there's your friendship.

11:34.380 --> 11:36.880
So like I said, when I could skip, I would.

11:36.880 --> 11:39.620
I was always the last one to get photos taken for my parents to buy.

11:39.620 --> 11:42.740
You know, you have to take that big permission envelope home, and then you're told to dress

11:42.740 --> 11:45.980
up that day at school, and then you can order wallet sized or whatever.

11:45.980 --> 11:48.740
I wanted to skip my grade school graduation, but I wasn't allowed.

11:48.740 --> 11:52.000
Same with high school, though the minute I had that diploma in hand I was at the door.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.100
There was no way I was staying for the rest of the ceremony after my parents got the picture

11:55.100 --> 11:56.100
they wanted.

11:56.100 --> 11:57.760
But I did skip my high school prom.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.780
I spent that night playing Tales of Symphonia on the GameCube.

12:00.780 --> 12:01.780
Great game, totally worth it.

12:01.780 --> 12:05.620
During my last year of high school, in fact, I took on a job as the yearbook editor, and

12:05.620 --> 12:09.380
went on to create the worst yearbook the school had seen in 50 years.

12:09.380 --> 12:13.780
Only because the job gave me my own private office, and me and some friends carried up

12:13.780 --> 12:17.820
a couch and hooked up my GameCube to one of those TVs on carts, and we spent the final

12:17.820 --> 12:20.460
year of school playing Smash Brothers and skipping class.

12:20.460 --> 12:24.060
I skipped my university graduation too, didn't care, and I could at that point.

12:24.060 --> 12:28.620
And my most serious relationship, besides Naomi, never officially ended either.

12:28.620 --> 12:31.800
That's too long of a story to get into right now, but the circumstances were such that

12:31.800 --> 12:35.420
I had moved out without ever having that final we're done conversation.

12:35.420 --> 12:36.620
Same with a lot of the friends I didn't like.

12:36.620 --> 12:39.700
There was never a big blowout fight, there was never a reconciliation, there was never

12:39.700 --> 12:41.780
a goodbye, I just left school and didn't look back.

12:41.780 --> 12:45.180
I never really left a job on a bad note either, but most of the times I've moved on.

12:45.180 --> 12:48.680
It always lacked a definitive feeling of moving on, like if it was seasonal work it always

12:48.680 --> 12:50.780
ended on a see you next year kind of thing.

12:50.780 --> 12:54.060
In fact, one business closed down while I was on vacation.

12:54.060 --> 12:58.300
My life is full of stuff like this, where eras of my life never actually ended, they

12:58.300 --> 12:59.300
just faded.

12:59.300 --> 13:04.340
Naomi pointed out that my negative, not actively or violently negative, but more like boring

13:04.340 --> 13:08.820
and time-wasting negative, engagement with most of the normal institutions during, say,

13:08.820 --> 13:13.140
the first 15 years of life, likely caused me to develop an opt-out personality.

13:13.140 --> 13:16.900
If I can skip out and do my own thing, I will, and the easiest things to skip out on are

13:16.900 --> 13:18.520
those formal rites of passage.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.720
You still legally have the diploma even if you don't physically go through the ritual

13:21.720 --> 13:24.500
of wearing the robe and going up and shaking the hand and then sticking around for the

13:24.500 --> 13:25.700
speeches and all the rest of it.

13:25.700 --> 13:26.860
You don't have to go to your graduation.

13:26.860 --> 13:31.100
And looking back on it, I've left a lot of what many people consider to be the most important

13:31.100 --> 13:33.280
moments in a liminal state.

13:33.280 --> 13:36.940
Sometimes I couldn't get closure like with the ex-girlfriend, sometimes I actively avoided

13:36.940 --> 13:38.540
it, but the result is the same.

13:38.540 --> 13:42.700
In all practical ways, I have very little in my past left undone.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.460
But sometimes it doesn't feel like it.

13:44.460 --> 13:46.820
And being a YouTuber seems to be the ultimate liminal job.

13:46.820 --> 13:50.380
I know you guys watch me, I know that you're there, but physically it's just me and the

13:50.380 --> 13:51.380
mic.

13:51.380 --> 13:52.380
I'm by myself.

13:52.380 --> 13:55.580
I think there's liminality inherent in working from home, where the division between home

13:55.580 --> 13:57.140
time and work time is blurred.

13:57.140 --> 13:58.620
I kind of like it that way.

13:58.620 --> 14:02.460
It feels like an ideal zone to be in, to do some writing or reading for example, to be

14:02.460 --> 14:05.620
constantly on the cusp of a transformative process.

14:05.620 --> 14:07.300
But it also has its problems.

14:07.300 --> 14:11.120
Just like how I might enjoy how liminal certain parts of my life has been, there are still

14:11.120 --> 14:12.640
problems related to closure.

14:12.640 --> 14:17.180
And I can induce all of these feelings just by looking at a liminal image.

14:17.180 --> 14:21.300
That being said, this video shouldn't be taken as some kind of nihilistic millennial screed,

14:21.300 --> 14:22.860
nor should anybody really worry about me.

14:22.860 --> 14:26.060
Naomi was right about my opt-out personality, but only half right.

14:26.060 --> 14:29.900
A lot of millennials who are nihilistic and who opt-out, even my contemporaries at school,

14:29.900 --> 14:32.620
did so to get drunk or high or to fuck around with girls.

14:32.620 --> 14:33.620
I didn't.

14:33.620 --> 14:35.080
I spent a lot of time playing video games, yeah.

14:35.560 --> 14:38.720
But I eventually moved on to coding my own video games, or trying to write novels with

14:38.720 --> 14:39.880
every spare moment that I could get.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.160
In fact, I still think I have some of those old projects.

14:42.160 --> 14:45.040
Also in that box of junk, there was my old card game.

14:45.040 --> 14:48.960
Yeah, I got frustrated with Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh and ended up making my own game.

14:48.960 --> 14:51.320
It was full of memes and garbage, but I had fun making it.

14:51.320 --> 14:54.600
I had fun making my own rules, and my friends and I had a lot of fun playing it.

14:54.600 --> 14:58.240
I remember being a kid and hearing them be amazed, saying they could never think of making

14:58.240 --> 14:59.240
their own game.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.600
And I was just there thinking, how could you not?

15:01.600 --> 15:04.320
As an adult, I recognize what that opt-out impulse is.

15:04.360 --> 15:08.520
I didn't spend my youth rejecting normal institutions and losing out on the meaning found within

15:08.520 --> 15:11.440
them, though for a long time I thought that's what was going on with me.

15:11.440 --> 15:15.960
What was actually happening was, I was searching for alternative paths of meaning, because

15:15.960 --> 15:17.760
the normal ones weren't cutting it.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.020
And where possible, I was making my own.

15:20.020 --> 15:23.920
I think that's why I want to run my own business and be my own boss, and why I find working

15:23.920 --> 15:25.900
under other people to be absolutely hellish.

15:25.900 --> 15:27.560
And that's what I appreciate about Luminal Spaces.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.440
That's what I feel when I'm there.

15:29.440 --> 15:32.000
Some people feel scared because of their unsettling nature.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.560
Some people feel comforted, reminded of a good moment in their past.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.160
I've felt both of those things too.

15:36.160 --> 15:39.600
But most of the time I feel energized, like this is the zone.

15:39.600 --> 15:43.640
There was no way for me to do this video without sounding like I am up my own ass because I

15:43.640 --> 15:47.200
know my experiences aren't common, and I also know looking back that I was kind of a smarter

15:47.200 --> 15:48.280
than average child.

15:48.280 --> 15:51.400
That reception is unavoidable, so I've just made my peace with it.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.400
I don't actually view myself as better than anybody else, especially not as an adult.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.400
I'm just different.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.380
And also I know this isn't a political video, it's just a topic that I wanted to talk about

15:58.380 --> 15:59.380
for a bit.

15:59.380 --> 16:01.360
We will return to your scheduled politics content tomorrow.

16:01.720 --> 16:02.720
All right, that does it for me.

16:02.720 --> 16:03.720
Have a good one, guys.

16:03.720 --> 16:04.360
I love you.
