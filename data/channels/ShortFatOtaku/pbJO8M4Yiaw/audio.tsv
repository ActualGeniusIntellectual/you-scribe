0	10440	Hey, you know that Twitter account Liminal Spaces, or, uh, Space Liminal Bot, if you
10440	11440	want to go by the handle?
11440	15920	It's kinda unique in that it posts images of, well, what it calls liminal spaces.
15920	20040	Sometimes these are pictures of long hallways, dilapidated and dark, or perfectly normal
20040	23920	and well-lit, or appearing like it's a place out of time, like it's still a functioning
23920	27600	location just with an older aesthetic style, like the decor hasn't been updated since
27600	28600	the 80s.
28600	31400	These pictures can sometimes generate a sense of unease, almost like there's something
31400	34560	way down at the end of the hallway that's coming for you, but they can also generate
34560	38600	a feeling of comfort sometimes, like a place that you used to visit but no longer can because
38600	39600	it's gone.
39600	41240	Maybe it's been renovated, maybe it's been torn down, whatever.
41240	45960	And so now it only exists in your memories, or in the picture.
45960	50180	Sometimes the account posts images of pools or cisterns or other aquatic places.
50180	54620	These also come in the two main flavors, dark and unsettling, or pristine and comforting.
54620	58200	Even in the comforting ones, though, there's a sense of loneliness or loss.
58200	60600	No, not that kind of loss.
60600	64880	Sometimes the account posts pictures of evidence of human activity that has since gone dormant,
64880	68800	like something that is out of season or a location after closing, again in those two
68800	69800	main flavors.
69800	73080	Related to this one are pictures of cities and towns that are clearly still in use, but
73080	75720	from a weird angle or location or time of day.
75720	79600	In this case, people would normally be there here and now in the present day, but because
79600	83940	the picture is taken in the middle of a snowstorm or at 3am or something, no one's there.
83940	87500	What each of these different types of photo have in common is that they evoke liminal
87500	92660	feelings, the experience of being neither here nor there, of being in between places,
92660	95740	stuck out of time, falling through the cracks, that sort of thing.
95740	99360	Liminality began as an anthropological term, initially referring to the feeling of ambiguity
99360	103660	or disorientation that occurs in the middle stage of a rite of passage, where the rite's
103660	107720	participants no longer hold their pre-ritual status, but have not yet begun the transition
107720	109900	to the status they will hold when the rite is complete.
109900	113640	During a rite's liminal stage, participants stand at the threshold of the previous way
113640	118760	of structuring their identity, time, or community, and a new way which completing the rite establishes.
118760	120520	Or at least that's what the Wikipedia page says.
120520	121520	This makes a lot of sense to me.
121520	124800	Here's an experience that I had, and I think is relatively common, you can probably relate.
124800	126480	You had a part-time job in high school, right?
126480	129560	Maybe you could only work evenings and weekends because of school, that's pretty normal.
129560	132520	But then when summer break started, suddenly you were able to work different hours during
132520	133720	the weekday if you wanted.
133720	136860	You still held the identity of high school student, but you were working more like an
136860	138720	adult would in that same position.
138720	141820	And then when fall rolled around, you were back to that student's schedule.
141820	144020	This absolutely describes my part-time experience growing up.
144020	147180	Now think to that final summer before you went off to university.
147180	149720	You graduate high school, you're no longer a high school student.
149720	154540	The school building itself, its staff, its routines, and rituals are now cut off to you.
154540	156680	But you're still working that same high school job.
156680	158940	It's no longer a summer break in the same sense.
158940	161260	Maybe you're quitting the job at the end of the summer to move to another city to go
161260	162260	to school.
162260	165100	Maybe you're staying there and just transitioning to working as a normal adult.
165100	168500	Maybe you're going to university in the same city, and you can hold onto your job
168500	170500	for a few more years with a modified schedule.
170500	172760	But that final summer feels unique.
172760	176860	It feels like you're in between the identities of high school student and university student.
176860	178660	And I certainly felt that way looking back.
178660	181140	I didn't quite know what life held in store for me next.
181140	185500	I was in the process of shedding my high school life, but that job was one part of that life
185500	187180	that didn't go at graduation.
187180	189680	So in a way, I felt in limbo for that summer.
189680	194900	Arnold van Genep in his 1909 work, Rites of Passage, examined the various rites of passage
194900	196940	found within small-scale societies.
196940	201780	And this is where he first coined the term liminality to refer to that in-between period.
201780	205420	Previous practices and routines must be broken with a metaphorical death.
205420	209860	The rite must be a strict set of actions guided by a master of ceremonies.
209860	215220	The rite being simultaneously rigid and destructive is what allows for significant changes of
215220	216720	the initiate's identity.
216720	220360	After crossing the liminal threshold, the initiate reintegrates into society with a
220360	222340	new identity as a new person.
222340	224580	It's not hard to see these steps represented.
224580	228500	Not only in various primitive or prehistoric rites of passage, but also in their modern
228500	229500	equivalents.
229500	232540	Marriage, the process by which an outsider is brought into the family.
232540	235700	Graduation, the process by which you move from student to alumni.
235700	239860	Birthdays, New Year celebrations, promotions at work, leaving a workplace, moving out of
239860	240860	an apartment.
240860	243260	They all work roughly like this, more or less.
243260	246900	Even in the least serious events, like when you're watching the clock tick down to midnight
246900	251440	for New Year's, there's that single second of apprehension, of realization when the threshold
251440	252440	is crossed.
252440	253980	That feeling is liminality.
253980	255980	And these pictures seem to capture that feeling.
255980	257580	You can feel it when you look at them.
257580	259580	This is a space that's kind of off the map.
259580	260780	It's an in-between.
260780	264300	It's not explicitly spooky, like you shouldn't be here, that you're not welcome.
264300	267860	It's more like nobody's been here for a very long time.
267860	269940	And isn't that exact what the past is?
269940	272020	Somewhere where no one's been for a very long time?
272020	275420	You can get some of these same feelings if you check out screenshots of old video games
275420	276420	too.
276420	278900	Especially if they're games that you loved to death when you were growing up.
278900	281940	Games that you had totally gone beyond just beating, but you mastered them.
281940	283020	100% of them.
283060	285060	Some participated in online fandoms about them.
285060	288100	But even then, how long has it been since you actually played them?
288100	289940	Metroid Prime is one of my favorite games.
289940	294380	I regularly identify it as being on the list of favorite games, and yet, I haven't picked
294380	295380	up in over 10 years.
295380	300340	How long has it been since you played Half-Life, or System Shock, or Morrowind, or Mario 64?
300340	304660	Even as you stopped engaging with the thing, the feelings remained, and you didn't even
304660	307480	notice as the past began to recede.
307480	311020	Liminality is part of the reason why so many things right now are nostalgia bait.
311020	313820	How many old franchises have we seen that have been revived?
313820	315020	Butchered, yes.
315020	318580	But even the rare moment that they're done well, they still evoke this feeling.
318580	321580	How many indie games are coming out that try to look like Super Nintendo games?
321580	325260	Only not really, but how your child's eye remembers the SNES looking.
325260	327260	Or PlayStation 1 games now too.
327260	331180	Nostalgia can be fun, but I think the amount that we indulge in it can be unhealthy.
331180	334760	Even if all the legitimately new stuff people are making right now sucks.
334760	338400	Nostalgia is often used as a tool by people who want to elevate the good old days into
338400	339940	a product that they can sell you.
339940	343060	You can't buy back your childhood, no matter how hard you try.
343060	346700	And yet, nostalgia and liminality are related, but not the same.
346700	350580	To use liminality's terminology, nostalgia is the feeling after you've gone through
350580	354460	the rite of passage, while thinking back fondly about the old you from before.
354460	356060	That's not quite liminality.
356060	359700	It's normal to think back on a previous era of your life and say, yeah, we got up
359700	360700	to some shit, didn't we?
360700	361780	That was a good time.
361780	365680	But it's not normal to obsess over it, to want to desperately go back.
365680	369580	In fact, it's this tendency that I've seen leftoids online say that it's a major
369580	374200	driver for millennials today to become fascists because nostalgia is a gateway to reactionary
374200	375200	thinking.
375200	376200	But this isn't that kind of video.
376200	378000	Also, that's a retarded idea.
378000	381400	Within the past month or so, I had to return to my hometown to visit my parents.
381400	384000	My dad and I worked on the car that Naomi and I had just bought.
384000	386960	I can't do that kind of work here, but my parents' place is more equipped for it.
386960	390360	My parents also needed some help with moving some furniture and a few other jobs that it's
390360	392100	nice to have a young person around for.
392100	395300	My parents are certainly getting older, and every time I see them, they look more and
395300	398260	more dissimilar from what they look like in my head, which is still an image of them
398260	400340	from what I think are my teenage years.
400340	404160	It sounds strange to say, but sometimes you forget that time isn't only marching on
404160	406120	in places that you pay attention to.
406120	408300	A lot of the businesses in my hometown have closed down.
408300	410060	The buildings are boarded up and abandoned.
410060	412060	About one third of my school year never left town.
412060	413660	Another third left and came back.
413660	415020	Some have started families.
415020	416020	Some have become drug addicts.
416020	418460	There's a lot more heroin in the town than there used to be.
418460	422500	There's no local economy or opportunity in these small towns anymore, and it's not
422500	424060	all just COVID-related either.
424060	427860	I went for a walk through the forest that my friends and I used to hang out in as kids.
427860	431980	A bridge across a creek that a friend of a friend's family built was still there, but
431980	434180	it was beginning to rust and hadn't been kept up.
434180	438700	The old trails were still roughly in the same place, but the amount of overgrowth had drastically
438700	439700	changed.
439700	440700	Not surprising.
440700	441900	It had been 20 years since I went back there.
441900	446220	I wanted to show Naomi an abandoned house in the woods that Dave and I and other kids
446220	450900	would hang out in, but we hiked back far enough to discover that all the land had been cleared
450900	451900	out.
451900	454780	I planned to develop it eventually, but the building was gone, and the only thing left
454780	457180	of the trees were just large stacks of logs.
457180	459860	The town feels a lot emptier than it used to, and I don't just mean because of the
459860	462340	old ghosts of people who don't exist anymore.
462340	463340	Not really.
463340	466180	You're not the you you used to be, floating around in my mind anytime I went to a location
466180	467180	that triggered a memory.
467180	468180	And that was pretty much every location.
468180	470500	No, the town is also just emptier.
470500	471500	Less people there in total.
471500	474520	When I was a kid, during summer you could expect to see people walking around.
474520	476140	Even there, despite its small size.
476140	478620	There were regular summer festivals at the local ballpark.
478620	480360	There were playgrounds for kids to play on.
480360	484440	But now the town is largely dead, and a lot of that infrastructure is just decaying.
484440	487520	It's one of those places that time truly has left behind.
487520	491040	Naomi was even surprised that the local grocery store still uses rollers instead of conveyor
491040	492040	belts.
492040	494080	While I was there I had to get some old stuff from my parents place.
494080	497440	It was getting to the point where, if I didn't get it now I wouldn't be getting it at all.
497440	498440	And fair enough.
498440	501200	I've been gone long enough that my parents didn't want to hang on to it anymore.
501200	504200	It was largely junk, which is why I didn't take it with me when I moved out in the first
504200	505200	place.
505200	508440	Some stuff that I kept, either for nostalgia, or because it had actual value, like for example
508440	509920	my old Pokemon card collection.
510480	512480	I also discovered a pile of counterfeit DVDs.
512480	516900	I actually ran a side hustle in school, back when DVD burners were rare as fuck, and nobody
516900	518040	knew how to use computers.
518040	522520	I burned anime shows and TV shows to DVD, and sold them to kids out of my locker.
522520	526480	I even turned online wallpapers into fancy jewel case inserts.
526480	529900	You can even see lines from my family's failing inkjet printer.
529900	531720	I turned a pretty good profit on these.
531720	535480	But eventually they stopped selling, and the excess went into the back of a closet somewhere.
535480	538480	Also among the pile of stuff that was mine was a box of old school work from when I was
538480	539480	a child.
540040	541960	I remember school being exceptionally easy.
541960	546040	I never did homework, and when homework started counting towards grades, I always managed
546040	547700	to finish it before leaving school.
547700	550740	As I got older, I skipped school a fair bit to play video games.
550740	553160	And frankly, I think I learned more from video games than school.
553160	557600	Calculating out level ups or percentage chances to hit or whatever in an RPG had me caring
557600	560400	about math way more than anything I got out of a classroom.
560400	564080	And I certainly learned more about ethics from video games than I did reading pre-teen
564080	565080	novels too.
565080	568180	When I was at school, I would spend more time doodling than doing work.
568180	570940	Not because I was slacking, but because I finished the work really quickly.
570940	576220	Despite my total lack of care, I managed to get perfect or near perfect on everything
576220	577220	until I hit high school.
577220	579660	And in high school, getting regular 90s was not an issue.
579660	583060	I remember thinking when I was very young how stupid the other kids were, because what
583060	585060	the fuck, this stuff was easy guys.
585060	586060	How are you getting low marks?
586060	590040	But I learned very quickly to keep that view and my marks to myself if I wanted to keep
590040	591040	any friends.
591040	593740	And I remember valuing those friends very highly, even though the only one that I still
593740	594900	talked to was Dave.
594900	598620	I was offered the chance to skip ahead in grades on three separate occasions, though
598620	600180	I turned them all down for my friends.
600180	603100	If I had it all to do again I'd take the skip, if only to get out of school faster
603100	604420	those friends ended up not mattering.
604420	609100	I also got a participation award, yeah I wasn't an athlete in grade school, but I did legitimately
609100	610340	come athletic in high school.
610340	614180	However I had a pretty radical shift in my life from sixteen until graduation that caused
614180	616700	me to stop pursuing athletics and most other things.
616700	618700	And during that time I had some insomnia.
618700	622260	Even this though I have fond memories of, staying up late into the night playing video
622260	626820	games or watching shitty kung fu movies at like 3am where the entire town was asleep,
626820	629780	everything was dark, and the only light source is the blue of the TV.
629780	631500	It was, in a way, liminal.
631500	635160	This entire side conversation so far has been like 90% nostalgia.
635160	639180	And it probably sounds like me just wanking off all over you and wasting your time.
639180	642380	Well maybe, but there's actually something here that should tie it back around.
642380	646780	I've often felt that, in a way, I've existed in a liminal space for most of my adult life.
646780	650540	And I don't necessarily mean that negatively, I'm not suffering, I actually love my life.
650540	653620	But after talking with Naomi about it while wandering around the woods, I've come to
653620	657060	realize that my life has a remarkable lack of closure, all things considered.
657060	661100	There's a lot of normal things that people do, markers of life, transitions between eras
661100	663380	and your journey growing up, that I didn't do.
663380	665800	And I remember exactly why I skipped them all.
665800	669580	Because one, my parents forced me to do them when I didn't want to, so when I could get
669580	670860	away with skipping I would.
670860	675140	And two, because my engagement with the system was, for the most part, a gigantic waste of
675140	676140	time.
676140	678620	I always felt like I was never learning anything at school I hadn't already mastered.
678620	682040	I was being told to sit at a desk, to learn math and spelling I already knew, to read
682040	685920	books I had grown out of years earlier, to follow rules that were arbitrarily stupid,
685920	689300	and to hang out with kids I hated, but I had no other option for socialization because
689300	692260	it's a small town, so the best you get is the kid who's an asshole but also likes the
692260	694380	same kind of cookies that you do, and so there's your friendship.
694380	696880	So like I said, when I could skip, I would.
696880	699620	I was always the last one to get photos taken for my parents to buy.
699620	702740	You know, you have to take that big permission envelope home, and then you're told to dress
702740	705980	up that day at school, and then you can order wallet sized or whatever.
705980	708740	I wanted to skip my grade school graduation, but I wasn't allowed.
708740	712000	Same with high school, though the minute I had that diploma in hand I was at the door.
712000	715100	There was no way I was staying for the rest of the ceremony after my parents got the picture
715100	716100	they wanted.
716100	717760	But I did skip my high school prom.
717760	720780	I spent that night playing Tales of Symphonia on the GameCube.
720780	721780	Great game, totally worth it.
721780	725620	During my last year of high school, in fact, I took on a job as the yearbook editor, and
725620	729380	went on to create the worst yearbook the school had seen in 50 years.
729380	733780	Only because the job gave me my own private office, and me and some friends carried up
733780	737820	a couch and hooked up my GameCube to one of those TVs on carts, and we spent the final
737820	740460	year of school playing Smash Brothers and skipping class.
740460	744060	I skipped my university graduation too, didn't care, and I could at that point.
744060	748620	And my most serious relationship, besides Naomi, never officially ended either.
748620	751800	That's too long of a story to get into right now, but the circumstances were such that
751800	755420	I had moved out without ever having that final we're done conversation.
755420	756620	Same with a lot of the friends I didn't like.
756620	759700	There was never a big blowout fight, there was never a reconciliation, there was never
759700	761780	a goodbye, I just left school and didn't look back.
761780	765180	I never really left a job on a bad note either, but most of the times I've moved on.
765180	768680	It always lacked a definitive feeling of moving on, like if it was seasonal work it always
768680	770780	ended on a see you next year kind of thing.
770780	774060	In fact, one business closed down while I was on vacation.
774060	778300	My life is full of stuff like this, where eras of my life never actually ended, they
778300	779300	just faded.
779300	784340	Naomi pointed out that my negative, not actively or violently negative, but more like boring
784340	788820	and time-wasting negative, engagement with most of the normal institutions during, say,
788820	793140	the first 15 years of life, likely caused me to develop an opt-out personality.
793140	796900	If I can skip out and do my own thing, I will, and the easiest things to skip out on are
796900	798520	those formal rites of passage.
798520	801720	You still legally have the diploma even if you don't physically go through the ritual
801720	804500	of wearing the robe and going up and shaking the hand and then sticking around for the
804500	805700	speeches and all the rest of it.
805700	806860	You don't have to go to your graduation.
806860	811100	And looking back on it, I've left a lot of what many people consider to be the most important
811100	813280	moments in a liminal state.
813280	816940	Sometimes I couldn't get closure like with the ex-girlfriend, sometimes I actively avoided
816940	818540	it, but the result is the same.
818540	822700	In all practical ways, I have very little in my past left undone.
822700	824460	But sometimes it doesn't feel like it.
824460	826820	And being a YouTuber seems to be the ultimate liminal job.
826820	830380	I know you guys watch me, I know that you're there, but physically it's just me and the
830380	831380	mic.
831380	832380	I'm by myself.
832380	835580	I think there's liminality inherent in working from home, where the division between home
835580	837140	time and work time is blurred.
837140	838620	I kind of like it that way.
838620	842460	It feels like an ideal zone to be in, to do some writing or reading for example, to be
842460	845620	constantly on the cusp of a transformative process.
845620	847300	But it also has its problems.
847300	851120	Just like how I might enjoy how liminal certain parts of my life has been, there are still
851120	852640	problems related to closure.
852640	857180	And I can induce all of these feelings just by looking at a liminal image.
857180	861300	That being said, this video shouldn't be taken as some kind of nihilistic millennial screed,
861300	862860	nor should anybody really worry about me.
862860	866060	Naomi was right about my opt-out personality, but only half right.
866060	869900	A lot of millennials who are nihilistic and who opt-out, even my contemporaries at school,
869900	872620	did so to get drunk or high or to fuck around with girls.
872620	873620	I didn't.
873620	875080	I spent a lot of time playing video games, yeah.
875560	878720	But I eventually moved on to coding my own video games, or trying to write novels with
878720	879880	every spare moment that I could get.
879880	882160	In fact, I still think I have some of those old projects.
882160	885040	Also in that box of junk, there was my old card game.
885040	888960	Yeah, I got frustrated with Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh and ended up making my own game.
888960	891320	It was full of memes and garbage, but I had fun making it.
891320	894600	I had fun making my own rules, and my friends and I had a lot of fun playing it.
894600	898240	I remember being a kid and hearing them be amazed, saying they could never think of making
898240	899240	their own game.
899240	901600	And I was just there thinking, how could you not?
901600	904320	As an adult, I recognize what that opt-out impulse is.
904360	908520	I didn't spend my youth rejecting normal institutions and losing out on the meaning found within
908520	911440	them, though for a long time I thought that's what was going on with me.
911440	915960	What was actually happening was, I was searching for alternative paths of meaning, because
915960	917760	the normal ones weren't cutting it.
917760	920020	And where possible, I was making my own.
920020	923920	I think that's why I want to run my own business and be my own boss, and why I find working
923920	925900	under other people to be absolutely hellish.
925900	927560	And that's what I appreciate about Luminal Spaces.
927560	929440	That's what I feel when I'm there.
929440	932000	Some people feel scared because of their unsettling nature.
932160	934560	Some people feel comforted, reminded of a good moment in their past.
934560	936160	I've felt both of those things too.
936160	939600	But most of the time I feel energized, like this is the zone.
939600	943640	There was no way for me to do this video without sounding like I am up my own ass because I
943640	947200	know my experiences aren't common, and I also know looking back that I was kind of a smarter
947200	948280	than average child.
948280	951400	That reception is unavoidable, so I've just made my peace with it.
951400	954400	I don't actually view myself as better than anybody else, especially not as an adult.
954400	955400	I'm just different.
955400	958380	And also I know this isn't a political video, it's just a topic that I wanted to talk about
958380	959380	for a bit.
959380	961360	We will return to your scheduled politics content tomorrow.
961720	962720	All right, that does it for me.
962720	963720	Have a good one, guys.
963720	964360	I love you.
