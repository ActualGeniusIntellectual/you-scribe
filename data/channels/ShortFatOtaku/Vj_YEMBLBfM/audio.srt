1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
This is a unique situation.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,280
I'm currently on a time limit recording this.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,240
This is my only time to record a video until Tuesday, so if there's going to be content

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,760
on Monday it has to be recorded right now.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,420
And the only time I can record is this 45 minute window in between the ending of Sunday's

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,960
weekly sip, which just ended if you watch that live, I'm recording this right after,

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,520
and the beginning of ARCH's Skaven RP, which starts back up today, or yesterday for you

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,520
guys.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,220
So I have 45 minutes in between these two events to record this video, and then no free

10
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,540
time until Tuesday morning, so, so if there's going to be content on Monday I better do

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,540
it now.

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,200
Which means that this video is going to be a little bit lazy, but hey, it's fine, we're

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,680
going to have some fun, it's going to be a great time.

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,360
Allow me to introduce you to the hipster paradise of r slash we want plates.

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,800
This is the place that you go if you want to see the absolute depths of soy-swigging

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,540
socialist stupidity.

17
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,600
Let's say you decide to go out on the town, assuming that you have your vaccine passport.

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,880
You want to go and get a dinner with your friends or maybe with your girlfriend or whoever,

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,340
you're heading out to a restaurant, and you want to enjoy yourself.

20
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,000
So maybe there's a new place that opened up downtown.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,020
It's getting lots of good reviews.

22
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,580
Only it turns out, because it is hipster central, they kind of serve their food a little bit

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,840
strangely.

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,200
This one's not so bad actually, I guess we're starting off light.

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,360
Eating your meal out of a cast iron skillet.

26
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,200
I mean it's still technically food related, it's a skillet, it's kind of weird eating

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,800
out of a skillet, but hey, this is how they serve the food to you.

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
What's in there?

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
Is it sweet potatoes and beans?

30
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,120
You've got some bread, you've got some chicken, some portobello mushrooms, and it's clearly

31
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,680
not cooked in the cast iron skillet.

32
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
It's put into it.

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,680
So here you go.

34
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,680
Eat up.

35
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
How about this?

36
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,180
You've got chips in a box, and you've got the dip just spread out on a slab of wood.

37
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,340
Maybe get a few splinters in there, it'll add to the experience.

38
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,860
Here's a great classic mixture, cold ice cream and hot brownies dusted with powdered sugar

39
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,500
and served on what looks to be a plate of obsidian.

40
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,060
Not a plate like a dinner plate, but literally a sheet of stone.

41
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,000
I wonder if people who eat like this, that actually enjoy this, if they think it's classy

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
or something.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,940
Oh dude, check out this fancy wine decanter.

44
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:20,380
You know, if you're really worried about COVID, aren't you worried about that guy's

45
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,820
fingers touching everybody's wine?

46
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,860
Okay, this is literally like a rock.

47
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,620
It's not a rock plate.

48
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,260
It's a circular, smoothed rock.

49
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,980
Imagine you're sitting at a restaurant and someone just like walks up, here's your order,

50
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,140
sir, and puts down a fucking stone that you could skip across a lake.

51
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,540
Hey guys, it's New Year's, you want to go get drunk?

52
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,540
Sure, hold on.

53
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,540
Let me just get my beer ramen.

54
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,020
It's not actually beer in there, at least I assume.

55
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:52,780
I think this is literally a ramen shop that just serves the soup in a beer mug.

56
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,100
I guess it'd be easy to drink.

57
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,380
Oh my God, it's ice cream on a shovel.

58
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,020
I know it's cold, but it's not exactly snow, guys.

59
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,540
What the fuck?

60
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,080
Who wants to eat off of the blade of a shovel?

61
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,680
Who thought this was a good idea?

62
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,940
What dumb fuck hipster said, my popular downtown gastropub eating establishment will serve only

63
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,660
the finest food on shovels in solidarity with the working class.

64
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,660
You guys down for a steak?

65
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,660
I haven't had steak in a while.

66
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,540
I mean, I've had bulgogi, which is like steak strips made in a Korean style, but not like

67
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,820
a Western style barbecued steak.

68
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,460
You can get one at this place, they serve it on a brick.

69
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,700
You order your big fat cut of steak, maybe you want it rare, maybe you want it medium,

70
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,700
whatever, who cares?

71
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,060
The most important part is how thick is the brick that it's coming out on?

72
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,060
And you know what?

73
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,580
I bet the brick is on the house too.

74
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,080
All the hipsters who eat here, they can take that brick and go throw it through a window

75
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,420
at that night's protest.

76
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,820
This is one inventive way to get your meal to you.

77
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,900
You just have your wings on a cart and the waiter can just roll it across the table in

78
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,900
your direction.

79
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,500
I want to see waiters like pulling the cart by a rope or something and saying, beep, beep,

80
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,100
coming through as they deliver people's stuff.

81
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,780
This ain't food, but it still kind of fits.

82
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,580
The menus of this place are printed onto meat cleavers.

83
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,660
So I guess if you find the prices to be too offensive, you can just take this thing and

84
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,220
shove it into the head of your waiter.

85
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,240
Actually, to be fair, the prices aren't bad.

86
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,060
This one is titled, make sure you only eat what's edible.

87
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,820
What am I looking at?

88
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,380
It's a campfire, but is there supposed to be food in there?

89
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,700
It's like wood and rocks.

90
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,700
Maybe this is one of those performance pieces where you have cakes that are made to look

91
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,700
like other objects.

92
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,060
Maybe that's what this is.

93
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,420
You want a fruit and cheese platter?

94
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,420
Well, here it is.

95
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,460
You got an upside down wine glass with all the fruit stuffed inside and a bunch of onion

96
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,220
rings on the top of the wine glass.

97
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,960
I'm not even sure who's supposed to eat this without making a huge mess.

98
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,180
If this came out at a restaurant that I was at, I would be incredulous.

99
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,940
I would just be like, what, what the fuck am I looking at?

100
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,160
So I know people like cheesecake flavored milkshakes, but you ever actually had a slice

101
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,540
of cheesecake on top of your milkshake?

102
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,660
I mean, it looks good.

103
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,060
How the fuck are you supposed to eat it?

104
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,380
Do you eat it like an ice cream cone?

105
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,980
You just kind of like lick it or bite it on the way and hope it doesn't like fall the

106
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,280
way the models are holding it.

107
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,940
It's almost like they expect you to eat it on the go, but there's, there's no fucking

108
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,740
way anyone's ever eaten this on the go.

109
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,740
Have they?

110
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,740
Oh my God.

111
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,060
What kind of amalgamation is this?

112
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,680
This is all attached to a bloody Mary by various toothpicks and chopsticks.

113
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,340
And it's like a sandwich and onion rings and pickles and fries and chicken wings.

114
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,880
It looks like in a full pizza, all just balanced on a bloody Mary.

115
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,720
There's no way you can even eat this thing without the whole, there's a second bloody

116
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,960
Mary and I didn't even notice that there's no way you can eat this thing without the

117
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
whole thing.

118
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,960
Just toppling over.

119
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,260
What kind of hipster dumb fuck thought that this is what they should be selling at the

120
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,260
restaurant.

121
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,260
It's the early morning.

122
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,520
You don't have much time to spare.

123
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,300
You head over to your local coffee shop and breakfast nook to order some food while you

124
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,760
tap away on your overpriced MacBook air waiter says, yes, sir.

125
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,440
And brings out a bookshelf, a bookshelf full of food for you to pick at while you work.

126
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,920
This person ordered a nacho platter and it came literally in the kitchen sink.

127
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,440
Now this is actually be kind of interesting if the, if the faucets worked, like if you

128
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,920
could get like maybe cream cheese out one side and salsa at the other, that could be

129
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
kind of cool.

130
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
What am I kidding?

131
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,480
This, this looks fucking ridiculous.

132
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,040
Literally everything in the kitchen sink.

133
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Hey, you guys want the world's best scotch egg that comes in an award.

134
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,900
Now I don't even know what, what a scotch egg is.

135
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,900
It's probably some British thing.

136
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,300
That's what it sounds like.

137
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:28,260
It looks like it's egg wrapped in some kind of meat wrapped in some kind of breading that

138
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,260
gets fried.

139
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,940
It's probably like bar food or something.

140
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,240
We don't have that here in Canada, but tell me, tell me Brit bongers.

141
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,060
Is this how you would eat your scotch egg?

142
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,460
What am I looking at?

143
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,520
I don't even know what food this could possibly be.

144
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,340
I see like a single berry to the lemon slices, orange slices, and there's like some kind

145
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,020
of a gelatin.

146
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,940
I don't even know what this.

147
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,960
You know, dishes are not meant to completely destroy the dining experience to the point

148
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,040
that you don't even know what you're eating anymore.

149
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,600
Imagine ordering a cocktail and you get this fucking science experiment instead.

150
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Here you go.

151
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,480
Enjoy your test tubes embedded into the side of a fake tree.

152
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,360
You know, I always thought the whole eating sushi off a person thing was a meme.

153
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
I guess not.

154
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,920
I guess people actually do this stuff.

155
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
Why?

156
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
What's the point?

157
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
Like it's not even a cute girl.

158
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
Why?

159
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Look at this guy's face.

160
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
Look at this motherfucker's face.

161
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,840
He's like, yep, I get paid to do this.

162
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,940
I get paid to lie here and let people snip at my taint with some chopsticks.

163
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,120
It's a living.

164
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,940
You guys want your red jello served on tampons?

165
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,820
I'm sure there's some feminist restaurant out there that'll do it for you.

166
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,820
Why the hell not?

167
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,820
Jesus God.

168
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,220
Like I know it's not actually anything bad, but just the fact that it's a tampon makes

169
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,780
it look fucking disgusting.

170
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,180
Only for the most subversive palates.

171
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,340
Speaking of a palate, here is another cheese platter served on, in fact, a palate.

172
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,440
Now if you're a true working class individual, you fucking hate palates.

173
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,100
You have dealt with them your entire life.

174
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,900
You have received them, you have emptied them, you have stacked them.

175
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,900
Palates suck.

176
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,540
But if you're some kind of bourgeois champagne socialist who's never actually worked a real

177
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,620
fucking job in your life, this probably just seems quaint to you.

178
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:08,280
Of course, if you're looking for a more artistic palate, you can have your meal served to you

179
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,800
as if it were splotches of paint.

180
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,040
This place prides itself in having only the freshest olives.

181
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,900
In fact, they grow on a tree that they bring to you.

182
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,060
Well, they're not actually growing.

183
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,320
They're hooked onto a tree.

184
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,800
Clearly, they're not actually growing real olives here.

185
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,400
But hey, I guess it's the thought that counts.

186
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,560
You need meals to go?

187
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,900
We got meals to go.

188
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,900
Check this out.

189
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,120
It's a pizza served on a full assed tire.

190
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,120
That's right, you can chow down and then just roll away.

191
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,120
Oh my god, this meal actually looks a lot more dangerous than the last shovel one.

192
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,040
The last shovel one had like obviously rounded edges because it was clearly meant to be used

193
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,240
as, for some dumb fuck reason, a plate.

194
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,240
But this is like a real shovel head with, like look how sharp those edges are in comparison.

195
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,200
Well, just shovel it into your mouth, buddy.

196
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,820
This is probably the classiest way to eat pizza rolls.

197
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:59,000
Have them delivered to you strung up on a wash line, complete with clothespins.

198
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,260
Make sure they're dry before you eat them, guys.

199
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,820
Are they serving food on an iPad?

200
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,660
What kind of a fucking upscale place do you have to go to?

201
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,500
They're serving food on iPads.

202
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,200
Fuck the scratching from the utensils.

203
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Fuck it being stolen.

204
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Who cares?

205
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
What is buying one?

206
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
What kind of a place?

207
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,500
What would it cost to eat here, do you think?

208
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,180
Finally, a meal that tells us the true nature of justice.

209
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,020
I want the waiter to walk in like blindfolded delivering this and then just like falls all

210
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,020
over the place.

211
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,840
You ever get your drink served to you with steak strips inside of it?

212
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,280
Who seriously buys all this garbage?

213
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,280
What the fuck?

214
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,860
I just want to go to a place, order the food, have it brought in in like a way that I can

215
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,860
eat it.

216
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,860
It doesn't need to be like on a brick or in a boot or some other bullshit.

217
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,260
Just let me eat the fucking food.

218
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,300
Yes, I do literally mean from a boot.

219
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,220
This is a place that'll serve your wings from directly from the shoe.

220
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,480
Some of the stuff I don't mind so much.

221
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,040
Like this just looks like a regular meal.

222
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,980
Yeah, it's on a board, but it's not really the worst offender, is it?

223
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,980
It's kind of strange.

224
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,440
But like if you go to a sushi place and order sushi, it always comes in on little boards.

225
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,700
That's just the style for sushi and they've adapted that style for stuff that's clearly

226
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,700
not sushi.

227
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,380
So whatever, it's not a big deal.

228
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,140
But most of the stuff really just seems nuts.

229
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:16,140
It seems like people trying to go fucking crazy overboard, desperate for attention.

230
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,420
Because being a hipster whack job is the hot new thing where you get these unsufferable

231
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:25,900
beardos and art hoes talking to each other, OMG, did you go down to the new place on commercial?

232
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,660
You can get your food served to you in a coffin.

233
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,020
Isn't that so like deep?

234
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,380
It really makes you think about like the nature of life, you know?

235
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,740
Some of the food even looks good, but I just want to be served regular food, you know?

236
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,940
I don't want to have to go on an adventure just to eat the stuff that I've paid for.

237
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,380
So hopefully we see this sign on every single one of these restaurants in the near future.

238
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,540
Due to circumstances beyond our control, all meals will be served on plates.

239
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,700
We apologize if this spoils your experience.

240
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,580
No, no, it's okay.

241
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,660
The less hipster energy I have in my life, the better.
