0	7240	This is a unique situation.
7240	9280	I'm currently on a time limit recording this.
9280	13240	This is my only time to record a video until Tuesday, so if there's going to be content
13240	15760	on Monday it has to be recorded right now.
15760	21420	And the only time I can record is this 45 minute window in between the ending of Sunday's
21420	25960	weekly sip, which just ended if you watch that live, I'm recording this right after,
25960	31520	and the beginning of ARCH's Skaven RP, which starts back up today, or yesterday for you
31520	32520	guys.
32520	37220	So I have 45 minutes in between these two events to record this video, and then no free
37220	41540	time until Tuesday morning, so, so if there's going to be content on Monday I better do
41540	42540	it now.
42540	45200	Which means that this video is going to be a little bit lazy, but hey, it's fine, we're
45200	47680	going to have some fun, it's going to be a great time.
47680	53360	Allow me to introduce you to the hipster paradise of r slash we want plates.
53360	57800	This is the place that you go if you want to see the absolute depths of soy-swigging
57800	59540	socialist stupidity.
59540	64600	Let's say you decide to go out on the town, assuming that you have your vaccine passport.
64600	68880	You want to go and get a dinner with your friends or maybe with your girlfriend or whoever,
68880	72340	you're heading out to a restaurant, and you want to enjoy yourself.
72340	74000	So maybe there's a new place that opened up downtown.
74000	76020	It's getting lots of good reviews.
76020	80580	Only it turns out, because it is hipster central, they kind of serve their food a little bit
80580	81840	strangely.
81840	84200	This one's not so bad actually, I guess we're starting off light.
84200	86360	Eating your meal out of a cast iron skillet.
86360	90200	I mean it's still technically food related, it's a skillet, it's kind of weird eating
90200	93800	out of a skillet, but hey, this is how they serve the food to you.
93800	94800	What's in there?
94800	95800	Is it sweet potatoes and beans?
95800	100120	You've got some bread, you've got some chicken, some portobello mushrooms, and it's clearly
100120	102680	not cooked in the cast iron skillet.
102680	103680	It's put into it.
103680	104680	So here you go.
104680	105680	Eat up.
105680	106680	How about this?
106680	110180	You've got chips in a box, and you've got the dip just spread out on a slab of wood.
110180	113340	Maybe get a few splinters in there, it'll add to the experience.
113340	118860	Here's a great classic mixture, cold ice cream and hot brownies dusted with powdered sugar
118860	122500	and served on what looks to be a plate of obsidian.
122500	126060	Not a plate like a dinner plate, but literally a sheet of stone.
126060	131000	I wonder if people who eat like this, that actually enjoy this, if they think it's classy
131000	132000	or something.
132000	133940	Oh dude, check out this fancy wine decanter.
133940	140380	You know, if you're really worried about COVID, aren't you worried about that guy's
140380	142820	fingers touching everybody's wine?
142820	144860	Okay, this is literally like a rock.
144860	146620	It's not a rock plate.
146620	149260	It's a circular, smoothed rock.
149260	152980	Imagine you're sitting at a restaurant and someone just like walks up, here's your order,
152980	156140	sir, and puts down a fucking stone that you could skip across a lake.
156140	158540	Hey guys, it's New Year's, you want to go get drunk?
158540	159540	Sure, hold on.
159540	162540	Let me just get my beer ramen.
163140	167020	It's not actually beer in there, at least I assume.
167020	172780	I think this is literally a ramen shop that just serves the soup in a beer mug.
172780	174100	I guess it'd be easy to drink.
174100	176380	Oh my God, it's ice cream on a shovel.
176380	179020	I know it's cold, but it's not exactly snow, guys.
179020	180540	What the fuck?
180540	183080	Who wants to eat off of the blade of a shovel?
183080	184680	Who thought this was a good idea?
184680	190940	What dumb fuck hipster said, my popular downtown gastropub eating establishment will serve only
190940	195660	the finest food on shovels in solidarity with the working class.
195660	196660	You guys down for a steak?
196660	197660	I haven't had steak in a while.
197660	201540	I mean, I've had bulgogi, which is like steak strips made in a Korean style, but not like
201540	203820	a Western style barbecued steak.
203820	207460	You can get one at this place, they serve it on a brick.
207460	211700	You order your big fat cut of steak, maybe you want it rare, maybe you want it medium,
211700	212700	whatever, who cares?
212700	217060	The most important part is how thick is the brick that it's coming out on?
217060	218060	And you know what?
218060	219580	I bet the brick is on the house too.
219580	223080	All the hipsters who eat here, they can take that brick and go throw it through a window
223080	224420	at that night's protest.
224420	227820	This is one inventive way to get your meal to you.
227820	231900	You just have your wings on a cart and the waiter can just roll it across the table in
231900	232900	your direction.
232900	237500	I want to see waiters like pulling the cart by a rope or something and saying, beep, beep,
237500	240100	coming through as they deliver people's stuff.
240100	241780	This ain't food, but it still kind of fits.
241780	245580	The menus of this place are printed onto meat cleavers.
245580	249660	So I guess if you find the prices to be too offensive, you can just take this thing and
249660	251220	shove it into the head of your waiter.
251220	253240	Actually, to be fair, the prices aren't bad.
253240	256060	This one is titled, make sure you only eat what's edible.
256060	258820	What am I looking at?
258820	261380	It's a campfire, but is there supposed to be food in there?
261380	262700	It's like wood and rocks.
262700	266700	Maybe this is one of those performance pieces where you have cakes that are made to look
266700	267700	like other objects.
267700	269060	Maybe that's what this is.
269060	270420	You want a fruit and cheese platter?
270420	271420	Well, here it is.
271420	276460	You got an upside down wine glass with all the fruit stuffed inside and a bunch of onion
276460	278220	rings on the top of the wine glass.
278220	280960	I'm not even sure who's supposed to eat this without making a huge mess.
280960	285180	If this came out at a restaurant that I was at, I would be incredulous.
285180	287940	I would just be like, what, what the fuck am I looking at?
287940	292160	So I know people like cheesecake flavored milkshakes, but you ever actually had a slice
292160	294540	of cheesecake on top of your milkshake?
294540	296660	I mean, it looks good.
296660	298060	How the fuck are you supposed to eat it?
298060	299380	Do you eat it like an ice cream cone?
299380	302980	You just kind of like lick it or bite it on the way and hope it doesn't like fall the
302980	304280	way the models are holding it.
304280	306940	It's almost like they expect you to eat it on the go, but there's, there's no fucking
306940	308740	way anyone's ever eaten this on the go.
308740	309740	Have they?
309740	310740	Oh my God.
310740	312060	What kind of amalgamation is this?
312060	317680	This is all attached to a bloody Mary by various toothpicks and chopsticks.
317680	323340	And it's like a sandwich and onion rings and pickles and fries and chicken wings.
323340	328880	It looks like in a full pizza, all just balanced on a bloody Mary.
328880	331720	There's no way you can even eat this thing without the whole, there's a second bloody
331720	334960	Mary and I didn't even notice that there's no way you can eat this thing without the
334960	335960	whole thing.
335960	336960	Just toppling over.
336960	340260	What kind of hipster dumb fuck thought that this is what they should be selling at the
340260	341260	restaurant.
341260	342260	It's the early morning.
342260	343520	You don't have much time to spare.
343520	347300	You head over to your local coffee shop and breakfast nook to order some food while you
347300	351760	tap away on your overpriced MacBook air waiter says, yes, sir.
351760	356440	And brings out a bookshelf, a bookshelf full of food for you to pick at while you work.
356440	359920	This person ordered a nacho platter and it came literally in the kitchen sink.
359920	363440	Now this is actually be kind of interesting if the, if the faucets worked, like if you
363440	367920	could get like maybe cream cheese out one side and salsa at the other, that could be
367920	368920	kind of cool.
368920	369920	What am I kidding?
369920	371480	This, this looks fucking ridiculous.
371480	373040	Literally everything in the kitchen sink.
373040	377040	Hey, you guys want the world's best scotch egg that comes in an award.
377040	379900	Now I don't even know what, what a scotch egg is.
379900	380900	It's probably some British thing.
380900	382300	That's what it sounds like.
382300	388260	It looks like it's egg wrapped in some kind of meat wrapped in some kind of breading that
388260	389260	gets fried.
389260	390940	It's probably like bar food or something.
390940	395240	We don't have that here in Canada, but tell me, tell me Brit bongers.
395240	397060	Is this how you would eat your scotch egg?
397060	399460	What am I looking at?
399460	401520	I don't even know what food this could possibly be.
401520	407340	I see like a single berry to the lemon slices, orange slices, and there's like some kind
407340	409020	of a gelatin.
409020	410940	I don't even know what this.
410940	414960	You know, dishes are not meant to completely destroy the dining experience to the point
414960	417040	that you don't even know what you're eating anymore.
417040	421600	Imagine ordering a cocktail and you get this fucking science experiment instead.
421600	422600	Here you go.
422600	426480	Enjoy your test tubes embedded into the side of a fake tree.
426480	430360	You know, I always thought the whole eating sushi off a person thing was a meme.
430360	431360	I guess not.
431360	432920	I guess people actually do this stuff.
432920	433920	Why?
433920	434920	What's the point?
434920	435920	Like it's not even a cute girl.
435920	436920	Why?
436920	437920	Look at this guy's face.
437920	438920	Look at this motherfucker's face.
438920	440840	He's like, yep, I get paid to do this.
440840	444940	I get paid to lie here and let people snip at my taint with some chopsticks.
444940	446120	It's a living.
446120	448940	You guys want your red jello served on tampons?
448940	451820	I'm sure there's some feminist restaurant out there that'll do it for you.
451820	452820	Why the hell not?
452820	453820	Jesus God.
453820	458220	Like I know it's not actually anything bad, but just the fact that it's a tampon makes
458220	459780	it look fucking disgusting.
459780	462180	Only for the most subversive palates.
462180	466340	Speaking of a palate, here is another cheese platter served on, in fact, a palate.
466340	469440	Now if you're a true working class individual, you fucking hate palates.
469440	471100	You have dealt with them your entire life.
471100	474900	You have received them, you have emptied them, you have stacked them.
474900	475900	Palates suck.
475900	479540	But if you're some kind of bourgeois champagne socialist who's never actually worked a real
479540	482620	fucking job in your life, this probably just seems quaint to you.
482620	488280	Of course, if you're looking for a more artistic palate, you can have your meal served to you
488280	490800	as if it were splotches of paint.
490800	495040	This place prides itself in having only the freshest olives.
495040	497900	In fact, they grow on a tree that they bring to you.
497900	499060	Well, they're not actually growing.
499060	500320	They're hooked onto a tree.
500320	502800	Clearly, they're not actually growing real olives here.
502800	504400	But hey, I guess it's the thought that counts.
504400	505560	You need meals to go?
505560	506900	We got meals to go.
506900	507900	Check this out.
507900	510120	It's a pizza served on a full assed tire.
510120	513120	That's right, you can chow down and then just roll away.
513120	516120	Oh my god, this meal actually looks a lot more dangerous than the last shovel one.
516120	520040	The last shovel one had like obviously rounded edges because it was clearly meant to be used
520040	522240	as, for some dumb fuck reason, a plate.
522240	526240	But this is like a real shovel head with, like look how sharp those edges are in comparison.
526240	528200	Well, just shovel it into your mouth, buddy.
528200	530820	This is probably the classiest way to eat pizza rolls.
530820	539000	Have them delivered to you strung up on a wash line, complete with clothespins.
539000	541260	Make sure they're dry before you eat them, guys.
541260	544820	Are they serving food on an iPad?
544820	549660	What kind of a fucking upscale place do you have to go to?
549660	551500	They're serving food on iPads.
551500	553200	Fuck the scratching from the utensils.
553200	554200	Fuck it being stolen.
554200	555200	Who cares?
555200	556200	What is buying one?
556200	557200	What kind of a place?
557200	559500	What would it cost to eat here, do you think?
559500	563180	Finally, a meal that tells us the true nature of justice.
563180	567020	I want the waiter to walk in like blindfolded delivering this and then just like falls all
567020	568020	over the place.
568020	571840	You ever get your drink served to you with steak strips inside of it?
571840	574280	Who seriously buys all this garbage?
574280	575280	What the fuck?
575280	579860	I just want to go to a place, order the food, have it brought in in like a way that I can
579860	580860	eat it.
580860	583860	It doesn't need to be like on a brick or in a boot or some other bullshit.
583860	585260	Just let me eat the fucking food.
585260	587300	Yes, I do literally mean from a boot.
587300	591220	This is a place that'll serve your wings from directly from the shoe.
591220	592480	Some of the stuff I don't mind so much.
592480	594040	Like this just looks like a regular meal.
594040	596980	Yeah, it's on a board, but it's not really the worst offender, is it?
596980	597980	It's kind of strange.
597980	602440	But like if you go to a sushi place and order sushi, it always comes in on little boards.
602440	605700	That's just the style for sushi and they've adapted that style for stuff that's clearly
605700	606700	not sushi.
606700	608380	So whatever, it's not a big deal.
608380	611140	But most of the stuff really just seems nuts.
611140	616140	It seems like people trying to go fucking crazy overboard, desperate for attention.
616140	620420	Because being a hipster whack job is the hot new thing where you get these unsufferable
620420	625900	beardos and art hoes talking to each other, OMG, did you go down to the new place on commercial?
625900	628660	You can get your food served to you in a coffin.
628660	631020	Isn't that so like deep?
631020	635380	It really makes you think about like the nature of life, you know?
635380	638740	Some of the food even looks good, but I just want to be served regular food, you know?
638740	642940	I don't want to have to go on an adventure just to eat the stuff that I've paid for.
642940	647380	So hopefully we see this sign on every single one of these restaurants in the near future.
647380	651540	Due to circumstances beyond our control, all meals will be served on plates.
651540	653700	We apologize if this spoils your experience.
653700	655580	No, no, it's okay.
655580	658660	The less hipster energy I have in my life, the better.
