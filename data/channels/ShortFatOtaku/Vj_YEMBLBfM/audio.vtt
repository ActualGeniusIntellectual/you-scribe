WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.240
This is a unique situation.

00:07.240 --> 00:09.280
I'm currently on a time limit recording this.

00:09.280 --> 00:13.240
This is my only time to record a video until Tuesday, so if there's going to be content

00:13.240 --> 00:15.760
on Monday it has to be recorded right now.

00:15.760 --> 00:21.420
And the only time I can record is this 45 minute window in between the ending of Sunday's

00:21.420 --> 00:25.960
weekly sip, which just ended if you watch that live, I'm recording this right after,

00:25.960 --> 00:31.520
and the beginning of ARCH's Skaven RP, which starts back up today, or yesterday for you

00:31.520 --> 00:32.520
guys.

00:32.520 --> 00:37.220
So I have 45 minutes in between these two events to record this video, and then no free

00:37.220 --> 00:41.540
time until Tuesday morning, so, so if there's going to be content on Monday I better do

00:41.540 --> 00:42.540
it now.

00:42.540 --> 00:45.200
Which means that this video is going to be a little bit lazy, but hey, it's fine, we're

00:45.200 --> 00:47.680
going to have some fun, it's going to be a great time.

00:47.680 --> 00:53.360
Allow me to introduce you to the hipster paradise of r slash we want plates.

00:53.360 --> 00:57.800
This is the place that you go if you want to see the absolute depths of soy-swigging

00:57.800 --> 00:59.540
socialist stupidity.

00:59.540 --> 01:04.600
Let's say you decide to go out on the town, assuming that you have your vaccine passport.

01:04.600 --> 01:08.880
You want to go and get a dinner with your friends or maybe with your girlfriend or whoever,

01:08.880 --> 01:12.340
you're heading out to a restaurant, and you want to enjoy yourself.

01:12.340 --> 01:14.000
So maybe there's a new place that opened up downtown.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.020
It's getting lots of good reviews.

01:16.020 --> 01:20.580
Only it turns out, because it is hipster central, they kind of serve their food a little bit

01:20.580 --> 01:21.840
strangely.

01:21.840 --> 01:24.200
This one's not so bad actually, I guess we're starting off light.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.360
Eating your meal out of a cast iron skillet.

01:26.360 --> 01:30.200
I mean it's still technically food related, it's a skillet, it's kind of weird eating

01:30.200 --> 01:33.800
out of a skillet, but hey, this is how they serve the food to you.

01:33.800 --> 01:34.800
What's in there?

01:34.800 --> 01:35.800
Is it sweet potatoes and beans?

01:35.800 --> 01:40.120
You've got some bread, you've got some chicken, some portobello mushrooms, and it's clearly

01:40.120 --> 01:42.680
not cooked in the cast iron skillet.

01:42.680 --> 01:43.680
It's put into it.

01:43.680 --> 01:44.680
So here you go.

01:44.680 --> 01:45.680
Eat up.

01:45.680 --> 01:46.680
How about this?

01:46.680 --> 01:50.180
You've got chips in a box, and you've got the dip just spread out on a slab of wood.

01:50.180 --> 01:53.340
Maybe get a few splinters in there, it'll add to the experience.

01:53.340 --> 01:58.860
Here's a great classic mixture, cold ice cream and hot brownies dusted with powdered sugar

01:58.860 --> 02:02.500
and served on what looks to be a plate of obsidian.

02:02.500 --> 02:06.060
Not a plate like a dinner plate, but literally a sheet of stone.

02:06.060 --> 02:11.000
I wonder if people who eat like this, that actually enjoy this, if they think it's classy

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
or something.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.940
Oh dude, check out this fancy wine decanter.

02:13.940 --> 02:20.380
You know, if you're really worried about COVID, aren't you worried about that guy's

02:20.380 --> 02:22.820
fingers touching everybody's wine?

02:22.820 --> 02:24.860
Okay, this is literally like a rock.

02:24.860 --> 02:26.620
It's not a rock plate.

02:26.620 --> 02:29.260
It's a circular, smoothed rock.

02:29.260 --> 02:32.980
Imagine you're sitting at a restaurant and someone just like walks up, here's your order,

02:32.980 --> 02:36.140
sir, and puts down a fucking stone that you could skip across a lake.

02:36.140 --> 02:38.540
Hey guys, it's New Year's, you want to go get drunk?

02:38.540 --> 02:39.540
Sure, hold on.

02:39.540 --> 02:42.540
Let me just get my beer ramen.

02:43.140 --> 02:47.020
It's not actually beer in there, at least I assume.

02:47.020 --> 02:52.780
I think this is literally a ramen shop that just serves the soup in a beer mug.

02:52.780 --> 02:54.100
I guess it'd be easy to drink.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.380
Oh my God, it's ice cream on a shovel.

02:56.380 --> 02:59.020
I know it's cold, but it's not exactly snow, guys.

02:59.020 --> 03:00.540
What the fuck?

03:00.540 --> 03:03.080
Who wants to eat off of the blade of a shovel?

03:03.080 --> 03:04.680
Who thought this was a good idea?

03:04.680 --> 03:10.940
What dumb fuck hipster said, my popular downtown gastropub eating establishment will serve only

03:10.940 --> 03:15.660
the finest food on shovels in solidarity with the working class.

03:15.660 --> 03:16.660
You guys down for a steak?

03:16.660 --> 03:17.660
I haven't had steak in a while.

03:17.660 --> 03:21.540
I mean, I've had bulgogi, which is like steak strips made in a Korean style, but not like

03:21.540 --> 03:23.820
a Western style barbecued steak.

03:23.820 --> 03:27.460
You can get one at this place, they serve it on a brick.

03:27.460 --> 03:31.700
You order your big fat cut of steak, maybe you want it rare, maybe you want it medium,

03:31.700 --> 03:32.700
whatever, who cares?

03:32.700 --> 03:37.060
The most important part is how thick is the brick that it's coming out on?

03:37.060 --> 03:38.060
And you know what?

03:38.060 --> 03:39.580
I bet the brick is on the house too.

03:39.580 --> 03:43.080
All the hipsters who eat here, they can take that brick and go throw it through a window

03:43.080 --> 03:44.420
at that night's protest.

03:44.420 --> 03:47.820
This is one inventive way to get your meal to you.

03:47.820 --> 03:51.900
You just have your wings on a cart and the waiter can just roll it across the table in

03:51.900 --> 03:52.900
your direction.

03:52.900 --> 03:57.500
I want to see waiters like pulling the cart by a rope or something and saying, beep, beep,

03:57.500 --> 04:00.100
coming through as they deliver people's stuff.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.780
This ain't food, but it still kind of fits.

04:01.780 --> 04:05.580
The menus of this place are printed onto meat cleavers.

04:05.580 --> 04:09.660
So I guess if you find the prices to be too offensive, you can just take this thing and

04:09.660 --> 04:11.220
shove it into the head of your waiter.

04:11.220 --> 04:13.240
Actually, to be fair, the prices aren't bad.

04:13.240 --> 04:16.060
This one is titled, make sure you only eat what's edible.

04:16.060 --> 04:18.820
What am I looking at?

04:18.820 --> 04:21.380
It's a campfire, but is there supposed to be food in there?

04:21.380 --> 04:22.700
It's like wood and rocks.

04:22.700 --> 04:26.700
Maybe this is one of those performance pieces where you have cakes that are made to look

04:26.700 --> 04:27.700
like other objects.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.060
Maybe that's what this is.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.420
You want a fruit and cheese platter?

04:30.420 --> 04:31.420
Well, here it is.

04:31.420 --> 04:36.460
You got an upside down wine glass with all the fruit stuffed inside and a bunch of onion

04:36.460 --> 04:38.220
rings on the top of the wine glass.

04:38.220 --> 04:40.960
I'm not even sure who's supposed to eat this without making a huge mess.

04:40.960 --> 04:45.180
If this came out at a restaurant that I was at, I would be incredulous.

04:45.180 --> 04:47.940
I would just be like, what, what the fuck am I looking at?

04:47.940 --> 04:52.160
So I know people like cheesecake flavored milkshakes, but you ever actually had a slice

04:52.160 --> 04:54.540
of cheesecake on top of your milkshake?

04:54.540 --> 04:56.660
I mean, it looks good.

04:56.660 --> 04:58.060
How the fuck are you supposed to eat it?

04:58.060 --> 04:59.380
Do you eat it like an ice cream cone?

04:59.380 --> 05:02.980
You just kind of like lick it or bite it on the way and hope it doesn't like fall the

05:02.980 --> 05:04.280
way the models are holding it.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.940
It's almost like they expect you to eat it on the go, but there's, there's no fucking

05:06.940 --> 05:08.740
way anyone's ever eaten this on the go.

05:08.740 --> 05:09.740
Have they?

05:09.740 --> 05:10.740
Oh my God.

05:10.740 --> 05:12.060
What kind of amalgamation is this?

05:12.060 --> 05:17.680
This is all attached to a bloody Mary by various toothpicks and chopsticks.

05:17.680 --> 05:23.340
And it's like a sandwich and onion rings and pickles and fries and chicken wings.

05:23.340 --> 05:28.880
It looks like in a full pizza, all just balanced on a bloody Mary.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.720
There's no way you can even eat this thing without the whole, there's a second bloody

05:31.720 --> 05:34.960
Mary and I didn't even notice that there's no way you can eat this thing without the

05:34.960 --> 05:35.960
whole thing.

05:35.960 --> 05:36.960
Just toppling over.

05:36.960 --> 05:40.260
What kind of hipster dumb fuck thought that this is what they should be selling at the

05:40.260 --> 05:41.260
restaurant.

05:41.260 --> 05:42.260
It's the early morning.

05:42.260 --> 05:43.520
You don't have much time to spare.

05:43.520 --> 05:47.300
You head over to your local coffee shop and breakfast nook to order some food while you

05:47.300 --> 05:51.760
tap away on your overpriced MacBook air waiter says, yes, sir.

05:51.760 --> 05:56.440
And brings out a bookshelf, a bookshelf full of food for you to pick at while you work.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.920
This person ordered a nacho platter and it came literally in the kitchen sink.

05:59.920 --> 06:03.440
Now this is actually be kind of interesting if the, if the faucets worked, like if you

06:03.440 --> 06:07.920
could get like maybe cream cheese out one side and salsa at the other, that could be

06:07.920 --> 06:08.920
kind of cool.

06:08.920 --> 06:09.920
What am I kidding?

06:09.920 --> 06:11.480
This, this looks fucking ridiculous.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.040
Literally everything in the kitchen sink.

06:13.040 --> 06:17.040
Hey, you guys want the world's best scotch egg that comes in an award.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.900
Now I don't even know what, what a scotch egg is.

06:19.900 --> 06:20.900
It's probably some British thing.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.300
That's what it sounds like.

06:22.300 --> 06:28.260
It looks like it's egg wrapped in some kind of meat wrapped in some kind of breading that

06:28.260 --> 06:29.260
gets fried.

06:29.260 --> 06:30.940
It's probably like bar food or something.

06:30.940 --> 06:35.240
We don't have that here in Canada, but tell me, tell me Brit bongers.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.060
Is this how you would eat your scotch egg?

06:37.060 --> 06:39.460
What am I looking at?

06:39.460 --> 06:41.520
I don't even know what food this could possibly be.

06:41.520 --> 06:47.340
I see like a single berry to the lemon slices, orange slices, and there's like some kind

06:47.340 --> 06:49.020
of a gelatin.

06:49.020 --> 06:50.940
I don't even know what this.

06:50.940 --> 06:54.960
You know, dishes are not meant to completely destroy the dining experience to the point

06:54.960 --> 06:57.040
that you don't even know what you're eating anymore.

06:57.040 --> 07:01.600
Imagine ordering a cocktail and you get this fucking science experiment instead.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.600
Here you go.

07:02.600 --> 07:06.480
Enjoy your test tubes embedded into the side of a fake tree.

07:06.480 --> 07:10.360
You know, I always thought the whole eating sushi off a person thing was a meme.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.360
I guess not.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.920
I guess people actually do this stuff.

07:12.920 --> 07:13.920
Why?

07:13.920 --> 07:14.920
What's the point?

07:14.920 --> 07:15.920
Like it's not even a cute girl.

07:15.920 --> 07:16.920
Why?

07:16.920 --> 07:17.920
Look at this guy's face.

07:17.920 --> 07:18.920
Look at this motherfucker's face.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.840
He's like, yep, I get paid to do this.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.940
I get paid to lie here and let people snip at my taint with some chopsticks.

07:24.940 --> 07:26.120
It's a living.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.940
You guys want your red jello served on tampons?

07:28.940 --> 07:31.820
I'm sure there's some feminist restaurant out there that'll do it for you.

07:31.820 --> 07:32.820
Why the hell not?

07:32.820 --> 07:33.820
Jesus God.

07:33.820 --> 07:38.220
Like I know it's not actually anything bad, but just the fact that it's a tampon makes

07:38.220 --> 07:39.780
it look fucking disgusting.

07:39.780 --> 07:42.180
Only for the most subversive palates.

07:42.180 --> 07:46.340
Speaking of a palate, here is another cheese platter served on, in fact, a palate.

07:46.340 --> 07:49.440
Now if you're a true working class individual, you fucking hate palates.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.100
You have dealt with them your entire life.

07:51.100 --> 07:54.900
You have received them, you have emptied them, you have stacked them.

07:54.900 --> 07:55.900
Palates suck.

07:55.900 --> 07:59.540
But if you're some kind of bourgeois champagne socialist who's never actually worked a real

07:59.540 --> 08:02.620
fucking job in your life, this probably just seems quaint to you.

08:02.620 --> 08:08.280
Of course, if you're looking for a more artistic palate, you can have your meal served to you

08:08.280 --> 08:10.800
as if it were splotches of paint.

08:10.800 --> 08:15.040
This place prides itself in having only the freshest olives.

08:15.040 --> 08:17.900
In fact, they grow on a tree that they bring to you.

08:17.900 --> 08:19.060
Well, they're not actually growing.

08:19.060 --> 08:20.320
They're hooked onto a tree.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.800
Clearly, they're not actually growing real olives here.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.400
But hey, I guess it's the thought that counts.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.560
You need meals to go?

08:25.560 --> 08:26.900
We got meals to go.

08:26.900 --> 08:27.900
Check this out.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.120
It's a pizza served on a full assed tire.

08:30.120 --> 08:33.120
That's right, you can chow down and then just roll away.

08:33.120 --> 08:36.120
Oh my god, this meal actually looks a lot more dangerous than the last shovel one.

08:36.120 --> 08:40.040
The last shovel one had like obviously rounded edges because it was clearly meant to be used

08:40.040 --> 08:42.240
as, for some dumb fuck reason, a plate.

08:42.240 --> 08:46.240
But this is like a real shovel head with, like look how sharp those edges are in comparison.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.200
Well, just shovel it into your mouth, buddy.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.820
This is probably the classiest way to eat pizza rolls.

08:50.820 --> 08:59.000
Have them delivered to you strung up on a wash line, complete with clothespins.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.260
Make sure they're dry before you eat them, guys.

09:01.260 --> 09:04.820
Are they serving food on an iPad?

09:04.820 --> 09:09.660
What kind of a fucking upscale place do you have to go to?

09:09.660 --> 09:11.500
They're serving food on iPads.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.200
Fuck the scratching from the utensils.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.200
Fuck it being stolen.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.200
Who cares?

09:15.200 --> 09:16.200
What is buying one?

09:16.200 --> 09:17.200
What kind of a place?

09:17.200 --> 09:19.500
What would it cost to eat here, do you think?

09:19.500 --> 09:23.180
Finally, a meal that tells us the true nature of justice.

09:23.180 --> 09:27.020
I want the waiter to walk in like blindfolded delivering this and then just like falls all

09:27.020 --> 09:28.020
over the place.

09:28.020 --> 09:31.840
You ever get your drink served to you with steak strips inside of it?

09:31.840 --> 09:34.280
Who seriously buys all this garbage?

09:34.280 --> 09:35.280
What the fuck?

09:35.280 --> 09:39.860
I just want to go to a place, order the food, have it brought in in like a way that I can

09:39.860 --> 09:40.860
eat it.

09:40.860 --> 09:43.860
It doesn't need to be like on a brick or in a boot or some other bullshit.

09:43.860 --> 09:45.260
Just let me eat the fucking food.

09:45.260 --> 09:47.300
Yes, I do literally mean from a boot.

09:47.300 --> 09:51.220
This is a place that'll serve your wings from directly from the shoe.

09:51.220 --> 09:52.480
Some of the stuff I don't mind so much.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.040
Like this just looks like a regular meal.

09:54.040 --> 09:56.980
Yeah, it's on a board, but it's not really the worst offender, is it?

09:56.980 --> 09:57.980
It's kind of strange.

09:57.980 --> 10:02.440
But like if you go to a sushi place and order sushi, it always comes in on little boards.

10:02.440 --> 10:05.700
That's just the style for sushi and they've adapted that style for stuff that's clearly

10:05.700 --> 10:06.700
not sushi.

10:06.700 --> 10:08.380
So whatever, it's not a big deal.

10:08.380 --> 10:11.140
But most of the stuff really just seems nuts.

10:11.140 --> 10:16.140
It seems like people trying to go fucking crazy overboard, desperate for attention.

10:16.140 --> 10:20.420
Because being a hipster whack job is the hot new thing where you get these unsufferable

10:20.420 --> 10:25.900
beardos and art hoes talking to each other, OMG, did you go down to the new place on commercial?

10:25.900 --> 10:28.660
You can get your food served to you in a coffin.

10:28.660 --> 10:31.020
Isn't that so like deep?

10:31.020 --> 10:35.380
It really makes you think about like the nature of life, you know?

10:35.380 --> 10:38.740
Some of the food even looks good, but I just want to be served regular food, you know?

10:38.740 --> 10:42.940
I don't want to have to go on an adventure just to eat the stuff that I've paid for.

10:42.940 --> 10:47.380
So hopefully we see this sign on every single one of these restaurants in the near future.

10:47.380 --> 10:51.540
Due to circumstances beyond our control, all meals will be served on plates.

10:51.540 --> 10:53.700
We apologize if this spoils your experience.

10:53.700 --> 10:55.580
No, no, it's okay.

10:55.580 --> 10:58.660
The less hipster energy I have in my life, the better.
