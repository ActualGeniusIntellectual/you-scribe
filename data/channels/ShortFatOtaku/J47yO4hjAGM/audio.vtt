00:00.000 --> 00:08.240
good morning my friends it's about uh it's about 9 30 in the morning here on august 22nd 2019

00:08.800 --> 00:14.480
and some of you might recognize this ratty old couch um well only if you watch the gaming streams

00:14.480 --> 00:18.320
anyway because this is the coach we sit on every single day when we do them but i thought i'd talk

00:18.320 --> 00:23.280
to you guys about where i've been what i've been doing why there hasn't been an sfo video in in

00:23.280 --> 00:28.800
basically a month there was the downvote video and then there was yesterday's jumping with scrump

00:28.800 --> 00:33.840
and that's it now on the one hand i haven't just been vacationing i haven't been you know you know

00:33.840 --> 00:39.520
being lazy or anything i've actually been doing a lot of behind the scenes stuff and it's stuff

00:39.520 --> 00:45.200
that people might not necessarily um notice or even care about on first glance anyway

00:45.200 --> 00:51.920
for example i decided to pick up um a new tv on prime day recently and what ended up happening

00:51.920 --> 00:56.400
there's there's the green wall by the way just for those of you who care yeah this is our green

00:56.400 --> 01:03.280
screen studio but what ended up happening was um to integrate this thing into the game boomer setup

01:03.280 --> 01:09.760
for for my streams on twitch um it actually took a lot more work than i initially thought

01:10.320 --> 01:14.800
mainly because i have a really jury-rigged system like if you if you watch the streams if you've

01:14.800 --> 01:20.400
seen them before if you check them out or whatever um you'll know that it's it's not just a regular

01:20.400 --> 01:26.080
face cam or a regular mic setup we do have something that's actually relatively unique

01:26.080 --> 01:32.960
and relatively hard to maintain and i've kind of jury-rigged the whole thing so this is a storage

01:32.960 --> 01:40.400
slash crawl space behind the green screen studio um and this is where i keep the now three computers

01:40.960 --> 01:46.640
that run game boomers when i'm streaming um so this is this is the the gaming pc if we're playing

01:46.640 --> 01:53.120
a pc game it plays on this the one in the back there um that's the show pc so the show pc runs

01:53.120 --> 01:59.760
off that the one in the middle um that's actually an older pc it doesn't really need to be that good

01:59.760 --> 02:05.680
because all it does is it handles the guest calls so for example if you if you donate a hundred

02:05.680 --> 02:11.200
dollars to the channel you choose a game you come on a discord call and i put the calls on its own

02:11.200 --> 02:16.800
pc because this thing it's a good pc but it's notoriously unstable i think i need to get a new

02:16.800 --> 02:21.440
one at some point and before the guest calls would actually run off this when the game crashed we

02:21.440 --> 02:26.640
would lose the guest so the easiest way to do it was to just add this older pc that we had kicking

02:26.640 --> 02:31.280
around um i might upgrade that in the future too but it's not bad it's like you know it's like a

02:31.280 --> 02:38.160
four-year-old pc but anyway to put this into the setup as well as the tv i had to basically rewire

02:38.160 --> 02:42.560
everything and there's a lot of i don't know if you can tell back there there's a lot of wires i

02:42.560 --> 02:46.560
might actually have to like make a vlog of how i do game boomers at some point because some people

02:46.560 --> 02:56.560
have shown an interest yeah a lot of wires there's a like a 16 input hdmi hub back there

02:56.560 --> 03:02.160
there's an hdcp stripper back there basically i've had to really figure out how to do all this stuff

03:02.160 --> 03:08.560
um and there was a lot of work that i i had basically just been putting off and as soon as i

03:08.560 --> 03:15.440
got the new tv as well as a new computer freed up in the house that i could use um i basically

03:15.440 --> 03:19.120
said you know what now is the time to do all the work i'll do it all at once at the same time i

03:19.120 --> 03:25.760
had to like run new electrical and i had to run some piping so so basically all the host stuff

03:25.760 --> 03:31.120
i just took like a week and did that that was at the same time that i was framing all my artwork

03:31.120 --> 03:36.720
by the way and you know what turned out pretty good but i'm also very aware that game boomers

03:36.720 --> 03:42.320
just isn't as popular as sfo the twitch streams might see 30 people they might see 40 they might

03:42.320 --> 03:49.200
see 20 you know they don't get the four or five figure views that that i get here on sfo i do wish

03:49.200 --> 03:53.760
it was as popular yeah please feel free to check it out if you like but i also understand the

03:53.760 --> 03:59.280
reality of the situation so i have been doing some other things as well for example i've been

03:59.280 --> 04:05.040
dealing with some artists who are going to be making new sfo artwork for the various videos

04:05.040 --> 04:09.360
and the various video series that i have planned for the main channel at the same time i've also

04:09.360 --> 04:15.440
been getting some art done for my my uh my my grab bag channel on my anything goes channel

04:15.440 --> 04:20.560
called the dev kit and what i've been doing on that channel is i've been recording a lot of

04:20.560 --> 04:28.160
unboxings i have some relatively unique hardware like the nintendo 64 hdmi mod or stuff like the

04:28.160 --> 04:36.960
super nt the mega sg i recorded an unboxing of that 64 inch uh tv as well as some rather weird

04:36.960 --> 04:43.120
settings it has so if you actually happen to have that model of tv or any any similar tv by lg you

04:43.120 --> 04:46.960
know how to set up a few things that might be hidden away in the menu i'm going to be recording

04:46.960 --> 04:53.120
this soon this is uh this is a gamecube that i've i've pulled apart because this fan is look look

04:53.120 --> 04:59.520
at that it's completely broken the fan's just gone man so i'm going to show how to replace a fan in a

04:59.520 --> 05:03.280
gamecube if you happen to have um have to have an old gamecube kicking around it's not working

05:03.280 --> 05:07.920
anymore i know that this is not strictly the politics sfo stuff that you guys subbed for

05:08.640 --> 05:14.320
which is why i'm not putting it strictly on sfo i'm putting on the dev kit but i do want to try

05:14.320 --> 05:19.600
my hand at doing something more techy more hands-on you know and hopefully it'll be

05:20.240 --> 05:23.760
interesting enough and i have i have enough technological oddities around the house that i

05:23.760 --> 05:29.200
think i can at least captivate your attention a little bit the dev kit is where all of the old

05:29.200 --> 05:34.640
anime reviews from like 10 years ago went uh they're over there however youtube won't let

05:34.640 --> 05:40.400
some of them go up there because of copyright issues and etc so every single old anime review

05:40.400 --> 05:44.880
is up on the dev kit bit shoot channel and if there's ever any new anime reviews to be made

05:44.880 --> 05:50.480
they'll probably go on the dev kit if there's ever any new unboxings or or hardware oddities

05:50.480 --> 05:57.120
they'll go on the dev kit if maybe maybe i might even make that like the the sfo update channel in

05:57.120 --> 06:02.000
a sense too where like if you want to know where i've been what i've been doing my side projects

06:02.000 --> 06:08.480
some behind the scenes stuff some vlogs i can put those up there as well another project i did i've

06:08.480 --> 06:12.640
filmed all the videos but i haven't released them yet and yeah they'll be up on the dev kit as well

06:12.640 --> 06:18.160
because it's not political um there was an office nearby where they threw out something like five or

06:18.160 --> 06:23.280
six computers they just dumped them on the side of the road so i i loaded them up i brought them

06:23.280 --> 06:28.640
back to the house and i noticed that like i mean i don't need them all my computers are better but

06:28.640 --> 06:33.120
they're still in good working order they're like three years old five years old they're not really

06:33.120 --> 06:38.640
bad computers in a sense um and they still work i guess it was just office boomers throwing shit

06:38.640 --> 06:44.240
away that they don't actually understand so what i did was i shot a video series and that'll be

06:44.240 --> 06:49.840
coming out on the dev kit probably in in the coming month um where i repaired them i took

06:49.840 --> 06:55.280
these broken computers repaired them put them in working order and once i had them all fixed up i

06:55.280 --> 07:00.080
i actually raffled them off on my discord so there's like a few people who were students who

07:00.080 --> 07:04.080
were going to school who had no money who couldn't afford a pc so i said here's what we'll do i'll

07:04.080 --> 07:08.960
mail these pcs off to to the neediest people in the discord no offense but by needy or anything

07:08.960 --> 07:12.000
guys but you know what i mean though guys i wanted to give them away to somebody who who couldn't

07:12.000 --> 07:17.360
afford them but anyway they covered the shipping i repaired them i made a short video series out

07:17.360 --> 07:23.200
of it and then i i mailed them off and it was um it was fun it was interesting i got to help a

07:23.200 --> 07:28.640
few people but that took up a few days of my schedule in general though i will say uh join

07:28.640 --> 07:34.400
the discord guys there's actually quite a lot of of community interaction in there um i am in there

07:34.400 --> 07:39.120
sometimes not all the time because you know i'm i am busy too but i try to be in there as much as

07:39.120 --> 07:44.320
i can it's also a good way to uh to be alerted as to when the next stream or the next video is coming

07:44.320 --> 07:50.000
out for any of my projects whether that's sfo game boomers or dev kit they all get alerted there

07:50.000 --> 07:54.960
so it's a it's a good place to hang out and honestly i i really like my community everyone

07:54.960 --> 08:01.120
who's in there is um i wouldn't necessarily say wholesome but i would say good people

08:01.760 --> 08:08.080
so basically what i've been doing is a lot of it has just been side projects and and organizational

08:08.080 --> 08:14.880
stuff and irl stuff that i've just let get away from me frankly i'm not exactly proud to say it

08:14.880 --> 08:20.480
but a lot of it has just um been stuff that's needed doing or stuff project that i've wanted

08:20.480 --> 08:26.640
to do that i've put off for like a year and and i'm finally just doing them oh there's something

08:26.640 --> 08:31.360
else too let me let me get this off the tripod my garden has been going wild dude look at all

08:31.360 --> 08:36.960
those cucumbers here we are we're at the second floor window and uh look at that man i know i

08:36.960 --> 08:42.400
showed you a video of it like a month ago um but it's really improved since then dude

08:43.680 --> 08:46.800
oh yeah it turns out that those peppers they're actually jalapeno peppers i thought they were

08:46.800 --> 08:53.120
green peppers oops they were mislabeled at the store the plant but anyway there's a kale there

08:53.120 --> 08:57.920
there's some there's some gigantic tomato bushes at this point not even plants just bushes there's

08:57.920 --> 09:02.240
like a hundred tomatoes in there the cucumbers are growing up the deck because there's just so much

09:02.240 --> 09:08.160
of them it's a there's kale yeah there's there's peppers and there's there's like a a tiny basil

09:08.160 --> 09:14.720
plant there's naomi's naomi's poor basil plant that didn't really take off but yeah man the garden's

09:14.720 --> 09:18.560
been going great and i've been spending a lot of time doing this there's also been another

09:18.560 --> 09:24.880
situation developing in that ever since e3 basically which was the electronics gaming

09:24.880 --> 09:32.320
expo uh the start of june um i haven't been properly cataloging all the information sources

09:32.320 --> 09:36.640
that i've been getting in through through dms and emails and facebook messages and through

09:36.640 --> 09:42.240
just finding stuff on my own and i'll i'll get into why that is in a little bit but basically

09:42.240 --> 09:49.600
it had built up to the point that i had nothing organized i had like one text file that was

09:49.600 --> 09:56.160
something like 10 000 lines long with a bunch of unrelated yet still useful links and information

09:57.280 --> 10:03.680
and it was my fault for letting it get that bad but i had to before i could make any videos at all

10:03.680 --> 10:09.120
i had to sit down and basically go through each link one by one and divide them up into

10:10.720 --> 10:18.320
basically into into scripts and into topics so i've done that now here's here's a picture

10:18.320 --> 10:26.960
there's probably about 200 300 video topics right here and that took a long time like it took maybe

10:28.160 --> 10:34.080
geez it probably took at least a week or two to do part of it was the fact that i let it get built

10:34.080 --> 10:40.160
up in my head honestly there was so much and that i and i kept adding to it every day because people

10:40.160 --> 10:44.640
kept sending me stuff every day i do appreciate it but it was my fault that i didn't get on top of it

10:45.280 --> 10:51.040
um and then part of it was that opening this many links on a computer often bombs a computer so i

10:51.040 --> 10:55.600
gotta like cut it out piecemeal and then in between doing everything else it just got to a point where

10:56.320 --> 11:01.200
it um it became like one of those almost insurmountable tasks where the more you

11:01.200 --> 11:05.600
avoid it the bigger it gets but the more you avoid it the more you want to avoid it

11:06.720 --> 11:11.360
so eventually i just had to knuckle down and do it and you know eventually i did and now i can

11:11.360 --> 11:17.040
actually make videos again because i actually have things ready to go i have scripts partially

11:17.040 --> 11:22.240
written i have sources laid out i can actually make sfo videos again properly oh and while i've

11:22.240 --> 11:27.600
been doing all this i've also been losing weight again i got back on the wagon and it honestly

11:27.600 --> 11:39.120
feels pretty good at the start of the month i was 221.2 pounds now i am 209.8 it's not a major

11:39.120 --> 11:44.640
victory but it is a victory and hopefully by i can reach my my goal by the end of the year of

11:44.640 --> 11:50.080
getting to my goal weight i had set that as a new year's resolution the year is what two-thirds over

11:50.080 --> 11:57.440
and i haven't really made any serious progress but i'm gonna do it that's enough screwing around

11:57.440 --> 12:05.680
i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do all this stuff i've had so many projects fall apart i've i've missed

12:05.680 --> 12:11.920
game boomer streams i've i haven't uploaded to sfo much recently this is what i want to do with

12:11.920 --> 12:17.440
my life it is it is my dream and this community these people that you are my friends in a sense

12:18.560 --> 12:24.400
and i've been irresponsible and i've let it kind of fall apart and there's no one to blame but

12:24.400 --> 12:32.080
myself for this year's e3 i did overrun game boomers what a lot of of streamers do they

12:32.080 --> 12:38.080
stream the entire uh the entire conference so they'll watch it they'll react to it i did it

12:38.080 --> 12:42.400
with a bit more flair i think because we we had a couch and there was three of us you know

12:42.400 --> 12:47.040
watching these conferences and having a good laugh at them and they really did pay off you know we

12:47.040 --> 12:52.160
we capped out at about 210 viewers that's as high as i've ever gone on game boomers there's

12:52.160 --> 12:59.040
a handful of names that i first noticed in the twitch chat during e3 they are now regular viewers

12:59.040 --> 13:02.720
and i see them all the time on twitch whenever i go to stream and that and that's a that's

13:02.720 --> 13:06.880
a great feeling you know things have in fact worked out in a sense but the amount of work

13:06.880 --> 13:12.240
that e3 took was was pretty colossal i know i gained about 10 pounds just over that week

13:12.240 --> 13:17.760
because i wasn't eating properly i wasn't doing any kind of cleaning or proper cooking in the

13:17.760 --> 13:24.560
house um i wasn't doing anything any of my old good habits that had kind of got me through the spring

13:25.200 --> 13:30.320
i basically let everything fall apart to do e3 and then i didn't really recover from that

13:30.320 --> 13:37.600
basically until now at least on at least in some senses like just in terms of general house cleanup

13:37.600 --> 13:42.160
i found myself without any time because i had to catch up with with game boomers with my own

13:42.160 --> 13:49.040
health with sfo with with everything and i you know i didn't i just didn't have any time anymore

13:49.040 --> 13:52.560
i honestly don't know how the bigger streamers do it maybe they're just better at this than i am

13:52.560 --> 13:59.600
and by the time i did get everything you know good again in terms of my own personal habits in terms

13:59.600 --> 14:07.440
of my workflow in terms of keeping things clean and eating right and and and being productive

14:07.440 --> 14:13.200
again when i finally got everything back together um it was prime day frankly it took me that long

14:13.840 --> 14:18.800
and then i got the tv and then i had to do all of that all of that like uh almost construction

14:18.800 --> 14:24.640
style work and all that rewiring so that's you know as soon as i had my energy back and i was

14:24.640 --> 14:30.880
good to go again um i had a massive project in front of me that wasn't sfo so that's basically

14:30.880 --> 14:37.200
basically where i've been i've been doing a lot of things but it just hasn't been stuff that you

14:37.200 --> 14:42.240
guys have been able to see yet it's almost entirely been behind the scenes or or projects

14:42.240 --> 14:48.320
that i've shot that i haven't yet released and i am sorry about not not keeping you uh in the loop

14:48.400 --> 14:52.080
there are some people in discord who were quite angry with me who said that i should have i should

14:52.080 --> 14:56.720
have told them sooner what i was doing that i wasn't just vanishing on them like like like

14:56.720 --> 15:02.320
spoonie or something but but that i was actually working because i was so yeah if you're in the

15:02.320 --> 15:08.160
discord and you're watching this i will definitely try to to keep you more updated on what i've been

15:08.160 --> 15:11.920
doing if i've been away for a while even if i just go on a vacation like if i leave for three or four

15:11.920 --> 15:16.560
days and just go travel somewhere i'll at least let you know that i'm doing that i'm not just gonna

15:17.120 --> 15:22.960
stay silent anymore and i don't know i don't want to get too much into the personal details of some

15:22.960 --> 15:29.360
things but like my girlfriend naomi has been having a rough time with some stuff my roommate

15:29.360 --> 15:35.360
dave he's been having a rough time with some stuff there's like work-related stress there's school

15:35.360 --> 15:44.240
stuff there's there's health problems cropping up now um then with me i'm i'm fine in that sense but

15:44.240 --> 15:49.120
it's the two closest people to me are having some serious difficulties in their lives right now

15:50.800 --> 15:54.720
and sometimes i'm taking care of them as much as i'm taking care of myself or the channel

15:56.000 --> 15:57.840
that there are days when it feels like i

16:00.400 --> 16:02.640
i have a lot on my shoulders even though

16:04.560 --> 16:09.440
i don't know sometimes it feels like i it shouldn't be that much or i shouldn't have

16:09.440 --> 16:14.160
this much of a problem with it but there are days when it feels like i'm i'm carrying everything

16:15.040 --> 16:20.000
doing these youtube channels these projects doing doing game boomers and and doing short parataku

16:20.880 --> 16:28.400
it's my dream job it's my dream job and it's my passion but there are also people around me who

16:29.040 --> 16:35.600
it seems like on some level they they they need me because i don't want to my own horn i don't

16:35.600 --> 16:40.640
want to sound egotistical but i am more stable than them and they do have serious problems um

16:41.280 --> 16:44.960
i don't want to toot my own horn or anything but but it does sometimes feel like

16:46.480 --> 16:54.080
i'm i'm their rock in a sense and i'm happy to do it but there are days when it gets to you

16:54.080 --> 17:00.480
i think if anybody's had to care for anybody else whether you're whether you have a family

17:00.480 --> 17:04.080
or whether you're taking care of your parents or or whatever it is that you're doing

17:04.720 --> 17:08.160
i think you i think you know what i'm talking about there are days when it gets to you there

17:08.160 --> 17:13.280
are days when you it feels like you can't do everything or that you're letting or that no

17:13.280 --> 17:17.600
matter what you do or that no matter what you prioritize you're letting somebody somewhere down

17:18.560 --> 17:25.040
or that all the things that that have to be done there's just too many you know and from e3 until

17:25.040 --> 17:30.960
prime day i mean from e3 until now but but to a greater extent from e3 until prime day it felt

17:30.960 --> 17:36.560
like i was putting out a lot of fires all the time and not really getting ahead anyway i didn't

17:36.560 --> 17:40.640
mean for this to to be this serious i didn't want to get you guys down or anything i just wanted to

17:40.640 --> 17:46.240
explain to you what i've been doing and also to let you know that i will in fact be back

17:47.280 --> 17:53.200
i have a new sfo video planned for tomorrow all of the behind the scenes work is finally done

17:53.200 --> 17:58.400
i'm good to go you're gonna see videos again if you're one of the people who watches game boomers

17:58.400 --> 18:04.560
you're gonna see streams again and if if any of my my unboxings or my vlogs or my technological

18:04.560 --> 18:10.080
content or any of my other side projects sound interesting to you head over to my youtube

18:10.080 --> 18:15.200
channel called the dev kit and check that out that that's going to be my anything goes channel

18:15.200 --> 18:20.800
so if you are a supporter of me and of sfo and you're really only here for the political content

18:20.800 --> 18:25.200
i understand why most of this video didn't really appeal to you because it's me explaining stuff

18:25.200 --> 18:30.720
that's for the most part not related to the political content um if you do care about me

18:30.720 --> 18:39.600
though as as a person or if you care about my side projects then well then that's what's been going

18:39.600 --> 18:44.800
on and if you care to check out my side projects i would be very grateful because i put it just

18:44.800 --> 18:51.440
as much work into them as i do into sfo um i stream pretty much six nights a week now

18:51.520 --> 18:59.680
at twitch.tv slash game boomers the stream archive goes up at youtube.com slash game boomers

18:59.680 --> 19:05.760
and as for that anything goes channel the the dev kit i'm actually considering starting to do stream

19:05.760 --> 19:10.800
super cuts on that channel as well so if you can't actually sit down and watch multiple hours of

19:10.800 --> 19:17.040
stream a day you can at least see like the highlights of of some of the games but that's

19:17.040 --> 19:21.840
a project that i'll be working on maybe maybe when the fall rolls around well if you've made

19:21.840 --> 19:27.200
to the end of this video thank you very much for sticking with me i do have to slightly disappoint

19:27.200 --> 19:34.000
