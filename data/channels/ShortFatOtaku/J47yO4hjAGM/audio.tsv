0	8240	good morning my friends it's about uh it's about 9 30 in the morning here on august 22nd 2019
8800	14480	and some of you might recognize this ratty old couch um well only if you watch the gaming streams
14480	18320	anyway because this is the coach we sit on every single day when we do them but i thought i'd talk
18320	23280	to you guys about where i've been what i've been doing why there hasn't been an sfo video in in
23280	28800	basically a month there was the downvote video and then there was yesterday's jumping with scrump
28800	33840	and that's it now on the one hand i haven't just been vacationing i haven't been you know you know
33840	39520	being lazy or anything i've actually been doing a lot of behind the scenes stuff and it's stuff
39520	45200	that people might not necessarily um notice or even care about on first glance anyway
45200	51920	for example i decided to pick up um a new tv on prime day recently and what ended up happening
51920	56400	there's there's the green wall by the way just for those of you who care yeah this is our green
56400	63280	screen studio but what ended up happening was um to integrate this thing into the game boomer setup
63280	69760	for for my streams on twitch um it actually took a lot more work than i initially thought
70320	74800	mainly because i have a really jury-rigged system like if you if you watch the streams if you've
74800	80400	seen them before if you check them out or whatever um you'll know that it's it's not just a regular
80400	86080	face cam or a regular mic setup we do have something that's actually relatively unique
86080	92960	and relatively hard to maintain and i've kind of jury-rigged the whole thing so this is a storage
92960	100400	slash crawl space behind the green screen studio um and this is where i keep the now three computers
100960	106640	that run game boomers when i'm streaming um so this is this is the the gaming pc if we're playing
106640	113120	a pc game it plays on this the one in the back there um that's the show pc so the show pc runs
113120	119760	off that the one in the middle um that's actually an older pc it doesn't really need to be that good
119760	125680	because all it does is it handles the guest calls so for example if you if you donate a hundred
125680	131200	dollars to the channel you choose a game you come on a discord call and i put the calls on its own
131200	136800	pc because this thing it's a good pc but it's notoriously unstable i think i need to get a new
136800	141440	one at some point and before the guest calls would actually run off this when the game crashed we
141440	146640	would lose the guest so the easiest way to do it was to just add this older pc that we had kicking
146640	151280	around um i might upgrade that in the future too but it's not bad it's like you know it's like a
151280	158160	four-year-old pc but anyway to put this into the setup as well as the tv i had to basically rewire
158160	162560	everything and there's a lot of i don't know if you can tell back there there's a lot of wires i
162560	166560	might actually have to like make a vlog of how i do game boomers at some point because some people
166560	176560	have shown an interest yeah a lot of wires there's a like a 16 input hdmi hub back there
176560	182160	there's an hdcp stripper back there basically i've had to really figure out how to do all this stuff
182160	188560	um and there was a lot of work that i i had basically just been putting off and as soon as i
188560	195440	got the new tv as well as a new computer freed up in the house that i could use um i basically
195440	199120	said you know what now is the time to do all the work i'll do it all at once at the same time i
199120	205760	had to like run new electrical and i had to run some piping so so basically all the host stuff
205760	211120	i just took like a week and did that that was at the same time that i was framing all my artwork
211120	216720	by the way and you know what turned out pretty good but i'm also very aware that game boomers
216720	222320	just isn't as popular as sfo the twitch streams might see 30 people they might see 40 they might
222320	229200	see 20 you know they don't get the four or five figure views that that i get here on sfo i do wish
229200	233760	it was as popular yeah please feel free to check it out if you like but i also understand the
233760	239280	reality of the situation so i have been doing some other things as well for example i've been
239280	245040	dealing with some artists who are going to be making new sfo artwork for the various videos
245040	249360	and the various video series that i have planned for the main channel at the same time i've also
249360	255440	been getting some art done for my my uh my my grab bag channel on my anything goes channel
255440	260560	called the dev kit and what i've been doing on that channel is i've been recording a lot of
260560	268160	unboxings i have some relatively unique hardware like the nintendo 64 hdmi mod or stuff like the
268160	276960	super nt the mega sg i recorded an unboxing of that 64 inch uh tv as well as some rather weird
276960	283120	settings it has so if you actually happen to have that model of tv or any any similar tv by lg you
283120	286960	know how to set up a few things that might be hidden away in the menu i'm going to be recording
286960	293120	this soon this is uh this is a gamecube that i've i've pulled apart because this fan is look look
293120	299520	at that it's completely broken the fan's just gone man so i'm going to show how to replace a fan in a
299520	303280	gamecube if you happen to have um have to have an old gamecube kicking around it's not working
303280	307920	anymore i know that this is not strictly the politics sfo stuff that you guys subbed for
308640	314320	which is why i'm not putting it strictly on sfo i'm putting on the dev kit but i do want to try
314320	319600	my hand at doing something more techy more hands-on you know and hopefully it'll be
320240	323760	interesting enough and i have i have enough technological oddities around the house that i
323760	329200	think i can at least captivate your attention a little bit the dev kit is where all of the old
329200	334640	anime reviews from like 10 years ago went uh they're over there however youtube won't let
334640	340400	some of them go up there because of copyright issues and etc so every single old anime review
340400	344880	is up on the dev kit bit shoot channel and if there's ever any new anime reviews to be made
344880	350480	they'll probably go on the dev kit if there's ever any new unboxings or or hardware oddities
350480	357120	they'll go on the dev kit if maybe maybe i might even make that like the the sfo update channel in
357120	362000	a sense too where like if you want to know where i've been what i've been doing my side projects
362000	368480	some behind the scenes stuff some vlogs i can put those up there as well another project i did i've
368480	372640	filmed all the videos but i haven't released them yet and yeah they'll be up on the dev kit as well
372640	378160	because it's not political um there was an office nearby where they threw out something like five or
378160	383280	six computers they just dumped them on the side of the road so i i loaded them up i brought them
383280	388640	back to the house and i noticed that like i mean i don't need them all my computers are better but
388640	393120	they're still in good working order they're like three years old five years old they're not really
393120	398640	bad computers in a sense um and they still work i guess it was just office boomers throwing shit
398640	404240	away that they don't actually understand so what i did was i shot a video series and that'll be
404240	409840	coming out on the dev kit probably in in the coming month um where i repaired them i took
409840	415280	these broken computers repaired them put them in working order and once i had them all fixed up i
415280	420080	i actually raffled them off on my discord so there's like a few people who were students who
420080	424080	were going to school who had no money who couldn't afford a pc so i said here's what we'll do i'll
424080	428960	mail these pcs off to to the neediest people in the discord no offense but by needy or anything
428960	432000	guys but you know what i mean though guys i wanted to give them away to somebody who who couldn't
432000	437360	afford them but anyway they covered the shipping i repaired them i made a short video series out
437360	443200	of it and then i i mailed them off and it was um it was fun it was interesting i got to help a
443200	448640	few people but that took up a few days of my schedule in general though i will say uh join
448640	454400	the discord guys there's actually quite a lot of of community interaction in there um i am in there
454400	459120	sometimes not all the time because you know i'm i am busy too but i try to be in there as much as
459120	464320	i can it's also a good way to uh to be alerted as to when the next stream or the next video is coming
464320	470000	out for any of my projects whether that's sfo game boomers or dev kit they all get alerted there
470000	474960	so it's a it's a good place to hang out and honestly i i really like my community everyone
474960	481120	who's in there is um i wouldn't necessarily say wholesome but i would say good people
481760	488080	so basically what i've been doing is a lot of it has just been side projects and and organizational
488080	494880	stuff and irl stuff that i've just let get away from me frankly i'm not exactly proud to say it
494880	500480	but a lot of it has just um been stuff that's needed doing or stuff project that i've wanted
500480	506640	to do that i've put off for like a year and and i'm finally just doing them oh there's something
506640	511360	else too let me let me get this off the tripod my garden has been going wild dude look at all
511360	516960	those cucumbers here we are we're at the second floor window and uh look at that man i know i
516960	522400	showed you a video of it like a month ago um but it's really improved since then dude
523680	526800	oh yeah it turns out that those peppers they're actually jalapeno peppers i thought they were
526800	533120	green peppers oops they were mislabeled at the store the plant but anyway there's a kale there
533120	537920	there's some there's some gigantic tomato bushes at this point not even plants just bushes there's
537920	542240	like a hundred tomatoes in there the cucumbers are growing up the deck because there's just so much
542240	548160	of them it's a there's kale yeah there's there's peppers and there's there's like a a tiny basil
548160	554720	plant there's naomi's naomi's poor basil plant that didn't really take off but yeah man the garden's
554720	558560	been going great and i've been spending a lot of time doing this there's also been another
558560	564880	situation developing in that ever since e3 basically which was the electronics gaming
564880	572320	expo uh the start of june um i haven't been properly cataloging all the information sources
572320	576640	that i've been getting in through through dms and emails and facebook messages and through
576640	582240	just finding stuff on my own and i'll i'll get into why that is in a little bit but basically
582240	589600	it had built up to the point that i had nothing organized i had like one text file that was
589600	596160	something like 10 000 lines long with a bunch of unrelated yet still useful links and information
597280	603680	and it was my fault for letting it get that bad but i had to before i could make any videos at all
603680	609120	i had to sit down and basically go through each link one by one and divide them up into
610720	618320	basically into into scripts and into topics so i've done that now here's here's a picture
618320	626960	there's probably about 200 300 video topics right here and that took a long time like it took maybe
628160	634080	geez it probably took at least a week or two to do part of it was the fact that i let it get built
634080	640160	up in my head honestly there was so much and that i and i kept adding to it every day because people
640160	644640	kept sending me stuff every day i do appreciate it but it was my fault that i didn't get on top of it
645280	651040	um and then part of it was that opening this many links on a computer often bombs a computer so i
651040	655600	gotta like cut it out piecemeal and then in between doing everything else it just got to a point where
656320	661200	it um it became like one of those almost insurmountable tasks where the more you
661200	665600	avoid it the bigger it gets but the more you avoid it the more you want to avoid it
666720	671360	so eventually i just had to knuckle down and do it and you know eventually i did and now i can
671360	677040	actually make videos again because i actually have things ready to go i have scripts partially
677040	682240	written i have sources laid out i can actually make sfo videos again properly oh and while i've
682240	687600	been doing all this i've also been losing weight again i got back on the wagon and it honestly
687600	699120	feels pretty good at the start of the month i was 221.2 pounds now i am 209.8 it's not a major
699120	704640	victory but it is a victory and hopefully by i can reach my my goal by the end of the year of
704640	710080	getting to my goal weight i had set that as a new year's resolution the year is what two-thirds over
710080	717440	and i haven't really made any serious progress but i'm gonna do it that's enough screwing around
717440	725680	i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do all this stuff i've had so many projects fall apart i've i've missed
725680	731920	game boomer streams i've i haven't uploaded to sfo much recently this is what i want to do with
731920	737440	my life it is it is my dream and this community these people that you are my friends in a sense
738560	744400	and i've been irresponsible and i've let it kind of fall apart and there's no one to blame but
744400	752080	myself for this year's e3 i did overrun game boomers what a lot of of streamers do they
752080	758080	stream the entire uh the entire conference so they'll watch it they'll react to it i did it
758080	762400	with a bit more flair i think because we we had a couch and there was three of us you know
762400	767040	watching these conferences and having a good laugh at them and they really did pay off you know we
767040	772160	we capped out at about 210 viewers that's as high as i've ever gone on game boomers there's
772160	779040	a handful of names that i first noticed in the twitch chat during e3 they are now regular viewers
779040	782720	and i see them all the time on twitch whenever i go to stream and that and that's a that's
782720	786880	a great feeling you know things have in fact worked out in a sense but the amount of work
786880	792240	that e3 took was was pretty colossal i know i gained about 10 pounds just over that week
792240	797760	because i wasn't eating properly i wasn't doing any kind of cleaning or proper cooking in the
797760	804560	house um i wasn't doing anything any of my old good habits that had kind of got me through the spring
805200	810320	i basically let everything fall apart to do e3 and then i didn't really recover from that
810320	817600	basically until now at least on at least in some senses like just in terms of general house cleanup
817600	822160	i found myself without any time because i had to catch up with with game boomers with my own
822160	829040	health with sfo with with everything and i you know i didn't i just didn't have any time anymore
829040	832560	i honestly don't know how the bigger streamers do it maybe they're just better at this than i am
832560	839600	and by the time i did get everything you know good again in terms of my own personal habits in terms
839600	847440	of my workflow in terms of keeping things clean and eating right and and and being productive
847440	853200	again when i finally got everything back together um it was prime day frankly it took me that long
853840	858800	and then i got the tv and then i had to do all of that all of that like uh almost construction
858800	864640	style work and all that rewiring so that's you know as soon as i had my energy back and i was
864640	870880	good to go again um i had a massive project in front of me that wasn't sfo so that's basically
870880	877200	basically where i've been i've been doing a lot of things but it just hasn't been stuff that you
877200	882240	guys have been able to see yet it's almost entirely been behind the scenes or or projects
882240	888320	that i've shot that i haven't yet released and i am sorry about not not keeping you uh in the loop
888400	892080	there are some people in discord who were quite angry with me who said that i should have i should
892080	896720	have told them sooner what i was doing that i wasn't just vanishing on them like like like
896720	902320	spoonie or something but but that i was actually working because i was so yeah if you're in the
902320	908160	discord and you're watching this i will definitely try to to keep you more updated on what i've been
908160	911920	doing if i've been away for a while even if i just go on a vacation like if i leave for three or four
911920	916560	days and just go travel somewhere i'll at least let you know that i'm doing that i'm not just gonna
917120	922960	stay silent anymore and i don't know i don't want to get too much into the personal details of some
922960	929360	things but like my girlfriend naomi has been having a rough time with some stuff my roommate
929360	935360	dave he's been having a rough time with some stuff there's like work-related stress there's school
935360	944240	stuff there's there's health problems cropping up now um then with me i'm i'm fine in that sense but
944240	949120	it's the two closest people to me are having some serious difficulties in their lives right now
950800	954720	and sometimes i'm taking care of them as much as i'm taking care of myself or the channel
956000	957840	that there are days when it feels like i
960400	962640	i have a lot on my shoulders even though
964560	969440	i don't know sometimes it feels like i it shouldn't be that much or i shouldn't have
969440	974160	this much of a problem with it but there are days when it feels like i'm i'm carrying everything
975040	980000	doing these youtube channels these projects doing doing game boomers and and doing short parataku
980880	988400	it's my dream job it's my dream job and it's my passion but there are also people around me who
989040	995600	it seems like on some level they they they need me because i don't want to my own horn i don't
995600	1000640	want to sound egotistical but i am more stable than them and they do have serious problems um
1001280	1004960	i don't want to toot my own horn or anything but but it does sometimes feel like
1006480	1014080	i'm i'm their rock in a sense and i'm happy to do it but there are days when it gets to you
1014080	1020480	i think if anybody's had to care for anybody else whether you're whether you have a family
1020480	1024080	or whether you're taking care of your parents or or whatever it is that you're doing
1024720	1028160	i think you i think you know what i'm talking about there are days when it gets to you there
1028160	1033280	are days when you it feels like you can't do everything or that you're letting or that no
1033280	1037600	matter what you do or that no matter what you prioritize you're letting somebody somewhere down
1038560	1045040	or that all the things that that have to be done there's just too many you know and from e3 until
1045040	1050960	prime day i mean from e3 until now but but to a greater extent from e3 until prime day it felt
1050960	1056560	like i was putting out a lot of fires all the time and not really getting ahead anyway i didn't
1056560	1060640	mean for this to to be this serious i didn't want to get you guys down or anything i just wanted to
1060640	1066240	explain to you what i've been doing and also to let you know that i will in fact be back
1067280	1073200	i have a new sfo video planned for tomorrow all of the behind the scenes work is finally done
1073200	1078400	i'm good to go you're gonna see videos again if you're one of the people who watches game boomers
1078400	1084560	you're gonna see streams again and if if any of my my unboxings or my vlogs or my technological
1084560	1090080	content or any of my other side projects sound interesting to you head over to my youtube
1090080	1095200	channel called the dev kit and check that out that that's going to be my anything goes channel
1095200	1100800	so if you are a supporter of me and of sfo and you're really only here for the political content
1100800	1105200	i understand why most of this video didn't really appeal to you because it's me explaining stuff
1105200	1110720	that's for the most part not related to the political content um if you do care about me
1110720	1119600	though as as a person or if you care about my side projects then well then that's what's been going
1119600	1124800	on and if you care to check out my side projects i would be very grateful because i put it just
1124800	1131440	as much work into them as i do into sfo um i stream pretty much six nights a week now
1131520	1139680	at twitch.tv slash game boomers the stream archive goes up at youtube.com slash game boomers
1139680	1145760	and as for that anything goes channel the the dev kit i'm actually considering starting to do stream
1145760	1150800	super cuts on that channel as well so if you can't actually sit down and watch multiple hours of
1150800	1157040	stream a day you can at least see like the highlights of of some of the games but that's
1157040	1161840	a project that i'll be working on maybe maybe when the fall rolls around well if you've made
1161840	1167200	to the end of this video thank you very much for sticking with me i do have to slightly disappoint
1167200	1174000	you by saying that this update video is in fact today's video on the sfo channel but you know what
1174000	1182000	i am back i am ready i have new videos coming you will see a new sfo video tomorrow a new proper one
1182000	1188160	tomorrow however right now as this video is playing for you immediately assuming that you're
1188160	1194320	watching it while it's uh it's coming out i'm gonna be streaming this on game boomers at twitch.tv
