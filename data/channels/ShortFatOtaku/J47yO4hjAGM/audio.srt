00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
good morning my friends it's about uh it's about 9 30 in the morning here on august 22nd 2019

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,480
and some of you might recognize this ratty old couch um well only if you watch the gaming streams

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,320
anyway because this is the coach we sit on every single day when we do them but i thought i'd talk

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,280
to you guys about where i've been what i've been doing why there hasn't been an sfo video in in

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,800
basically a month there was the downvote video and then there was yesterday's jumping with scrump

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,840
and that's it now on the one hand i haven't just been vacationing i haven't been you know you know

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,520
being lazy or anything i've actually been doing a lot of behind the scenes stuff and it's stuff

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,200
that people might not necessarily um notice or even care about on first glance anyway

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,920
for example i decided to pick up um a new tv on prime day recently and what ended up happening

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,400
there's there's the green wall by the way just for those of you who care yeah this is our green

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:03,280
screen studio but what ended up happening was um to integrate this thing into the game boomer setup

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,760
for for my streams on twitch um it actually took a lot more work than i initially thought

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,800
mainly because i have a really jury-rigged system like if you if you watch the streams if you've

14
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,400
seen them before if you check them out or whatever um you'll know that it's it's not just a regular

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,080
face cam or a regular mic setup we do have something that's actually relatively unique

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,960
and relatively hard to maintain and i've kind of jury-rigged the whole thing so this is a storage

17
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:40,400
slash crawl space behind the green screen studio um and this is where i keep the now three computers

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,640
that run game boomers when i'm streaming um so this is this is the the gaming pc if we're playing

19
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,120
a pc game it plays on this the one in the back there um that's the show pc so the show pc runs

20
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:59,760
off that the one in the middle um that's actually an older pc it doesn't really need to be that good

21
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,680
because all it does is it handles the guest calls so for example if you if you donate a hundred

22
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,200
dollars to the channel you choose a game you come on a discord call and i put the calls on its own

23
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,800
pc because this thing it's a good pc but it's notoriously unstable i think i need to get a new

24
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,440
one at some point and before the guest calls would actually run off this when the game crashed we

25
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,640
would lose the guest so the easiest way to do it was to just add this older pc that we had kicking

26
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,280
around um i might upgrade that in the future too but it's not bad it's like you know it's like a

27
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,160
four-year-old pc but anyway to put this into the setup as well as the tv i had to basically rewire

28
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,560
everything and there's a lot of i don't know if you can tell back there there's a lot of wires i

29
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,560
might actually have to like make a vlog of how i do game boomers at some point because some people

30
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:56,560
have shown an interest yeah a lot of wires there's a like a 16 input hdmi hub back there

31
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,160
there's an hdcp stripper back there basically i've had to really figure out how to do all this stuff

32
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,560
um and there was a lot of work that i i had basically just been putting off and as soon as i

33
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,440
got the new tv as well as a new computer freed up in the house that i could use um i basically

34
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,120
said you know what now is the time to do all the work i'll do it all at once at the same time i

35
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,760
had to like run new electrical and i had to run some piping so so basically all the host stuff

36
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,120
i just took like a week and did that that was at the same time that i was framing all my artwork

37
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,720
by the way and you know what turned out pretty good but i'm also very aware that game boomers

38
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,320
just isn't as popular as sfo the twitch streams might see 30 people they might see 40 they might

39
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:49,200
see 20 you know they don't get the four or five figure views that that i get here on sfo i do wish

40
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,760
it was as popular yeah please feel free to check it out if you like but i also understand the

41
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,280
reality of the situation so i have been doing some other things as well for example i've been

42
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,040
dealing with some artists who are going to be making new sfo artwork for the various videos

43
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,360
and the various video series that i have planned for the main channel at the same time i've also

44
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,440
been getting some art done for my my uh my my grab bag channel on my anything goes channel

45
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,560
called the dev kit and what i've been doing on that channel is i've been recording a lot of

46
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:28,160
unboxings i have some relatively unique hardware like the nintendo 64 hdmi mod or stuff like the

47
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:36,960
super nt the mega sg i recorded an unboxing of that 64 inch uh tv as well as some rather weird

48
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,120
settings it has so if you actually happen to have that model of tv or any any similar tv by lg you

49
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,960
know how to set up a few things that might be hidden away in the menu i'm going to be recording

50
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,120
this soon this is uh this is a gamecube that i've i've pulled apart because this fan is look look

51
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,520
at that it's completely broken the fan's just gone man so i'm going to show how to replace a fan in a

52
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,280
gamecube if you happen to have um have to have an old gamecube kicking around it's not working

53
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,920
anymore i know that this is not strictly the politics sfo stuff that you guys subbed for

54
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:14,320
which is why i'm not putting it strictly on sfo i'm putting on the dev kit but i do want to try

55
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,600
my hand at doing something more techy more hands-on you know and hopefully it'll be

56
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,760
interesting enough and i have i have enough technological oddities around the house that i

57
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,200
think i can at least captivate your attention a little bit the dev kit is where all of the old

58
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,640
anime reviews from like 10 years ago went uh they're over there however youtube won't let

59
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,400
some of them go up there because of copyright issues and etc so every single old anime review

60
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,880
is up on the dev kit bit shoot channel and if there's ever any new anime reviews to be made

61
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,480
they'll probably go on the dev kit if there's ever any new unboxings or or hardware oddities

62
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:57,120
they'll go on the dev kit if maybe maybe i might even make that like the the sfo update channel in

63
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,000
a sense too where like if you want to know where i've been what i've been doing my side projects

64
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,480
some behind the scenes stuff some vlogs i can put those up there as well another project i did i've

65
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,640
filmed all the videos but i haven't released them yet and yeah they'll be up on the dev kit as well

66
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,160
because it's not political um there was an office nearby where they threw out something like five or

67
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,280
six computers they just dumped them on the side of the road so i i loaded them up i brought them

68
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,640
back to the house and i noticed that like i mean i don't need them all my computers are better but

69
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,120
they're still in good working order they're like three years old five years old they're not really

70
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,640
bad computers in a sense um and they still work i guess it was just office boomers throwing shit

71
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,240
away that they don't actually understand so what i did was i shot a video series and that'll be

72
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,840
coming out on the dev kit probably in in the coming month um where i repaired them i took

73
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,280
these broken computers repaired them put them in working order and once i had them all fixed up i

74
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,080
i actually raffled them off on my discord so there's like a few people who were students who

75
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,080
were going to school who had no money who couldn't afford a pc so i said here's what we'll do i'll

76
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,960
mail these pcs off to to the neediest people in the discord no offense but by needy or anything

77
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,000
guys but you know what i mean though guys i wanted to give them away to somebody who who couldn't

78
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,360
afford them but anyway they covered the shipping i repaired them i made a short video series out

79
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,200
of it and then i i mailed them off and it was um it was fun it was interesting i got to help a

80
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,640
few people but that took up a few days of my schedule in general though i will say uh join

81
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,400
the discord guys there's actually quite a lot of of community interaction in there um i am in there

82
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,120
sometimes not all the time because you know i'm i am busy too but i try to be in there as much as

83
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,320
i can it's also a good way to uh to be alerted as to when the next stream or the next video is coming

84
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,000
out for any of my projects whether that's sfo game boomers or dev kit they all get alerted there

85
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,960
so it's a it's a good place to hang out and honestly i i really like my community everyone

86
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,120
who's in there is um i wouldn't necessarily say wholesome but i would say good people

87
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:08,080
so basically what i've been doing is a lot of it has just been side projects and and organizational

88
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,880
stuff and irl stuff that i've just let get away from me frankly i'm not exactly proud to say it

89
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,480
but a lot of it has just um been stuff that's needed doing or stuff project that i've wanted

90
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,640
to do that i've put off for like a year and and i'm finally just doing them oh there's something

91
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,360
else too let me let me get this off the tripod my garden has been going wild dude look at all

92
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,960
those cucumbers here we are we're at the second floor window and uh look at that man i know i

93
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,400
showed you a video of it like a month ago um but it's really improved since then dude

94
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,800
oh yeah it turns out that those peppers they're actually jalapeno peppers i thought they were

95
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,120
green peppers oops they were mislabeled at the store the plant but anyway there's a kale there

96
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,920
there's some there's some gigantic tomato bushes at this point not even plants just bushes there's

97
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,240
like a hundred tomatoes in there the cucumbers are growing up the deck because there's just so much

98
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,160
of them it's a there's kale yeah there's there's peppers and there's there's like a a tiny basil

99
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,720
plant there's naomi's naomi's poor basil plant that didn't really take off but yeah man the garden's

100
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,560
been going great and i've been spending a lot of time doing this there's also been another

101
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,880
situation developing in that ever since e3 basically which was the electronics gaming

102
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:32,320
expo uh the start of june um i haven't been properly cataloging all the information sources

103
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,640
that i've been getting in through through dms and emails and facebook messages and through

104
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,240
just finding stuff on my own and i'll i'll get into why that is in a little bit but basically

105
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:49,600
it had built up to the point that i had nothing organized i had like one text file that was

106
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,160
something like 10 000 lines long with a bunch of unrelated yet still useful links and information

107
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:03,680
and it was my fault for letting it get that bad but i had to before i could make any videos at all

108
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,120
i had to sit down and basically go through each link one by one and divide them up into

109
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:18,320
basically into into scripts and into topics so i've done that now here's here's a picture

110
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:26,960
there's probably about 200 300 video topics right here and that took a long time like it took maybe

111
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,080
geez it probably took at least a week or two to do part of it was the fact that i let it get built

112
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:40,160
up in my head honestly there was so much and that i and i kept adding to it every day because people

113
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,640
kept sending me stuff every day i do appreciate it but it was my fault that i didn't get on top of it

114
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:51,040
um and then part of it was that opening this many links on a computer often bombs a computer so i

115
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,600
gotta like cut it out piecemeal and then in between doing everything else it just got to a point where

116
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,200
it um it became like one of those almost insurmountable tasks where the more you

117
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,600
avoid it the bigger it gets but the more you avoid it the more you want to avoid it

118
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,360
so eventually i just had to knuckle down and do it and you know eventually i did and now i can

119
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,040
actually make videos again because i actually have things ready to go i have scripts partially

120
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,240
written i have sources laid out i can actually make sfo videos again properly oh and while i've

121
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,600
been doing all this i've also been losing weight again i got back on the wagon and it honestly

122
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:39,120
feels pretty good at the start of the month i was 221.2 pounds now i am 209.8 it's not a major

123
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,640
victory but it is a victory and hopefully by i can reach my my goal by the end of the year of

124
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,080
getting to my goal weight i had set that as a new year's resolution the year is what two-thirds over

125
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:57,440
and i haven't really made any serious progress but i'm gonna do it that's enough screwing around

126
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:05,680
i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do all this stuff i've had so many projects fall apart i've i've missed

127
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,920
game boomer streams i've i haven't uploaded to sfo much recently this is what i want to do with

128
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,440
my life it is it is my dream and this community these people that you are my friends in a sense

129
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,400
and i've been irresponsible and i've let it kind of fall apart and there's no one to blame but

130
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:32,080
myself for this year's e3 i did overrun game boomers what a lot of of streamers do they

131
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:38,080
stream the entire uh the entire conference so they'll watch it they'll react to it i did it

132
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,400
with a bit more flair i think because we we had a couch and there was three of us you know

133
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,040
watching these conferences and having a good laugh at them and they really did pay off you know we

134
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,160
we capped out at about 210 viewers that's as high as i've ever gone on game boomers there's

135
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:59,040
a handful of names that i first noticed in the twitch chat during e3 they are now regular viewers

136
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,720
and i see them all the time on twitch whenever i go to stream and that and that's a that's

137
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,880
a great feeling you know things have in fact worked out in a sense but the amount of work

138
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,240
that e3 took was was pretty colossal i know i gained about 10 pounds just over that week

139
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,760
because i wasn't eating properly i wasn't doing any kind of cleaning or proper cooking in the

140
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:24,560
house um i wasn't doing anything any of my old good habits that had kind of got me through the spring

141
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,320
i basically let everything fall apart to do e3 and then i didn't really recover from that

142
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:37,600
basically until now at least on at least in some senses like just in terms of general house cleanup

143
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,160
i found myself without any time because i had to catch up with with game boomers with my own

144
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,040
health with sfo with with everything and i you know i didn't i just didn't have any time anymore

145
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,560
i honestly don't know how the bigger streamers do it maybe they're just better at this than i am

146
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:59,600
and by the time i did get everything you know good again in terms of my own personal habits in terms

147
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,440
of my workflow in terms of keeping things clean and eating right and and and being productive

148
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,200
again when i finally got everything back together um it was prime day frankly it took me that long

149
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,800
and then i got the tv and then i had to do all of that all of that like uh almost construction

150
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,640
style work and all that rewiring so that's you know as soon as i had my energy back and i was

151
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,880
good to go again um i had a massive project in front of me that wasn't sfo so that's basically

152
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,200
basically where i've been i've been doing a lot of things but it just hasn't been stuff that you

153
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,240
guys have been able to see yet it's almost entirely been behind the scenes or or projects

154
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,320
that i've shot that i haven't yet released and i am sorry about not not keeping you uh in the loop

155
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,080
there are some people in discord who were quite angry with me who said that i should have i should

156
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,720
have told them sooner what i was doing that i wasn't just vanishing on them like like like

157
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,320
spoonie or something but but that i was actually working because i was so yeah if you're in the

158
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,160
discord and you're watching this i will definitely try to to keep you more updated on what i've been

159
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,920
doing if i've been away for a while even if i just go on a vacation like if i leave for three or four

160
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,560
days and just go travel somewhere i'll at least let you know that i'm doing that i'm not just gonna

161
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,960
stay silent anymore and i don't know i don't want to get too much into the personal details of some

162
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:29,360
things but like my girlfriend naomi has been having a rough time with some stuff my roommate

163
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,360
dave he's been having a rough time with some stuff there's like work-related stress there's school

164
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:44,240
stuff there's there's health problems cropping up now um then with me i'm i'm fine in that sense but

165
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,120
it's the two closest people to me are having some serious difficulties in their lives right now

166
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,720
and sometimes i'm taking care of them as much as i'm taking care of myself or the channel

167
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,840
that there are days when it feels like i

168
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,640
i have a lot on my shoulders even though

169
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,440
i don't know sometimes it feels like i it shouldn't be that much or i shouldn't have

170
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,160
this much of a problem with it but there are days when it feels like i'm i'm carrying everything

171
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,000
doing these youtube channels these projects doing doing game boomers and and doing short parataku

172
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:28,400
it's my dream job it's my dream job and it's my passion but there are also people around me who

173
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,600
it seems like on some level they they they need me because i don't want to my own horn i don't

174
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,640
want to sound egotistical but i am more stable than them and they do have serious problems um

175
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,960
i don't want to toot my own horn or anything but but it does sometimes feel like

176
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:54,080
i'm i'm their rock in a sense and i'm happy to do it but there are days when it gets to you

177
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,480
i think if anybody's had to care for anybody else whether you're whether you have a family

178
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,080
or whether you're taking care of your parents or or whatever it is that you're doing

179
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,160
i think you i think you know what i'm talking about there are days when it gets to you there

180
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,280
are days when you it feels like you can't do everything or that you're letting or that no

181
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,600
matter what you do or that no matter what you prioritize you're letting somebody somewhere down

182
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:25,040
or that all the things that that have to be done there's just too many you know and from e3 until

183
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,960
prime day i mean from e3 until now but but to a greater extent from e3 until prime day it felt

184
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,560
like i was putting out a lot of fires all the time and not really getting ahead anyway i didn't

185
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,640
mean for this to to be this serious i didn't want to get you guys down or anything i just wanted to

186
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,240
explain to you what i've been doing and also to let you know that i will in fact be back

187
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,200
i have a new sfo video planned for tomorrow all of the behind the scenes work is finally done

188
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,400
i'm good to go you're gonna see videos again if you're one of the people who watches game boomers

189
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,560
you're gonna see streams again and if if any of my my unboxings or my vlogs or my technological

190
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:10,080
content or any of my other side projects sound interesting to you head over to my youtube

191
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,200
channel called the dev kit and check that out that that's going to be my anything goes channel

192
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,800
so if you are a supporter of me and of sfo and you're really only here for the political content

193
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,200
i understand why most of this video didn't really appeal to you because it's me explaining stuff

194
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,720
that's for the most part not related to the political content um if you do care about me

195
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:39,600
though as as a person or if you care about my side projects then well then that's what's been going

196
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,800
on and if you care to check out my side projects i would be very grateful because i put it just

197
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:51,440
as much work into them as i do into sfo um i stream pretty much six nights a week now

198
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:59,680
at twitch.tv slash game boomers the stream archive goes up at youtube.com slash game boomers

199
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:05,760
and as for that anything goes channel the the dev kit i'm actually considering starting to do stream

200
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,800
super cuts on that channel as well so if you can't actually sit down and watch multiple hours of

201
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:17,040
stream a day you can at least see like the highlights of of some of the games but that's

202
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,840
a project that i'll be working on maybe maybe when the fall rolls around well if you've made

203
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,200
