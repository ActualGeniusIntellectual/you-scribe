1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Good morning, friends. The second week of August, sounds like there's a pressure washer going off

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,960
and the neighbor in the back, but I'm out here to water and it's garden time.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,720
Into the old shed once again. Put the scissors somewhere easier to get.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,320
And the watering can. Look at that juicy pepper over there, man.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,840
And this one, like it's finally coming through.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,360
Tomatoes are looking good. Cucumbers are going. Look at them grow up the vine.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,520
Except for that one. I mean that middle one's coming back. Maybe it'll work out.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,960
Now someone in the comments of the last video told me that these peas were not vine peas.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,360
They were in fact just bush peas. So they're not growing up. That kind of sucks.

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,360
But the peas are good. I'm going to need a bunch of this chard.

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,200
Yes, I said it charred properly this time. It's charred, not kale.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,280
I need a bunch of it this time because it kind of sucks to say,

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,280
but our car is having an issue right now. It's currently in the garage.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,760
So what that means is we're not going grocery shopping for a little bit,

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,560
which means we're eating these garden greens. So I'm getting a whole bunch of them for tonight's

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,800
dinner. One thing I found is if you want to keep these leaves going for like more than just a

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,080
couple hours, the best thing you can do is fill up a glass with a little bit of water

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,840
and stick them in the glass. So stay alive in the fridge like that for an extra day or two.

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,640
And there we go. The garden is watered and everything that I need for tonight

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,120
is harvested. There's like six leaves I think and a whole bunch of beans. I might have said peas

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,080
last time accidentally. It's beans, it's beans. Man, they always crucify me every single time I

22
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,560
get something wrong. I'm definitely getting less out of this spot with the beans than I was with

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,320
the peas in previous years. Especially since they didn't grow up the lattice, I thought they would.

24
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,400
So I don't know. I'd probably just go back to peas if I had to do it again.

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,680
By the way, here's what I was talking about with the chard. These leaves,

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,840
I picked them almost a week ago and they're still pretty good. I cut the ends so that

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,680
water can get in just like you would with, you know, flowers that you give to a girl or something.

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,480
Stood them up with just a little bit of water in the glass. Stuck them in there like so. Put them

29
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,880
in the fridge. Actually these ones here, the ones that I just cut, they're actually more limp than

30
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,800
the ones in here. So I'll probably like get a cleaner cut on the bottom and then put them in

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,920
here. So because the fridge is only so high, I do want them to be relatively the same height

32
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,000
if possible, which does mean losing some stem. And the stem is actually a pretty healthy part.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,280
That's unfortunate, but that's how it is. I guess I'll just do like right here.

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,360
There we go. And all of this into the glass. Just a little bit of water, not much.

35
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,680
And that'll do it. In the fridge it goes. Yeah man, it just barely fits. Oh, by the way,

36
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,200
yes Canada does have bagged milk. You know what though?

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:58,720
The tomato still isn't ripening or softening up. It's been a couple of weeks now. Hmm,

38
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,680
something might be wrong. It's the second week of August and you know what guys?

39
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,000
We've had so much rain that I haven't had to really water the garden that much at all.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,240
But as you can see down there, some of those leaves and the cucumbers right over there,

41
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,720
they're starting to go yellow. I think that means too much rain.

42
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,840
Ooh, there's thunder. It's actually picking up. Wow. Wow. At least there's no laundry on the line

43
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,280
this time. I wonder how our bird friends are doing. We're about halfway through August and

44
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,760
things are developing pretty quick. The pepper plants are starting to boom. There's a few

45
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,880
decent peppers in there. You see? Yeah. A couple of the tomatoes starting to go red over there.

46
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,040
Look at that. First big cucumber. Our bird friends aren't home today. Also,

47
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,160
it looks like something's digging in the garden because that tinier not making a cucumber plant.

48
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,400
Yeah. It got some dirt sprayed on it. Oh well. Yeah. I was thinking I was going to pick it,

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,000
but I don't think it's ready. If it's not ready, don't worry about it.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,520
Yeah. That's my mom, by the way. She's visiting. Oh.

51
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,720
The tomatoes are starting to come in though. Look at that. That tomato is turning yellow,

52
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,080
but this doesn't look like it's ripening. This looks like it's rotting. Oh well.

53
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,240
I guess we'll see how it turns out. Hello. It's the end of August. I'm out here to

54
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,960
water once again. By the way, yes, I did fix my watering can with Flex Seal.

55
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,240
This chard just keeps coming back, man. It just keeps coming back. We haven't really had to buy

56
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,920
much lettuce this summer. The peppers are getting big. You can probably take that one off right now

57
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,800
actually. They're pretty big. And some new blooms are coming in too. Oh, we had to use the ladder

58
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,920
at one point. So no more bird's nest. They had moved on though at that point. Don't worry. We

59
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,800
didn't, we didn't massacre any birds. The birds had moved on. The peas ended up being a big waste.

60
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,840
Only got a little bit out of them. Oh well. It's always good to try new things.

61
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,480
Oops. Looks like an animal got at one of the tomatoes. There are several ripe ones though.

62
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,720
These cucumbers are definitely big enough to eat. Look at this vine. It's going all the way up.

63
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:11,760
And then there. Yeah. I'll grab the tomatoes before something else happens to them. Ah, come

64
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:21,520
on. There we go. Brought this stuff to the kitchen and just realized a tomato from a few days ago.

65
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,840
It is getting wrinkly. So it's definitely like aging, but it's also turning red. I wonder how

66
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,520
this one's going to turn out. It's been a few more days and take a look at it. It actually

67
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,120
turned red. I'm very surprised. I actually expected it to rot. I've had green tomatoes go

68
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,360
from green to Brown before, but this one's actually red. Maybe it's edible. I guess we'll

69
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,960
see. August 29th. I need to start getting some of these vegetables out of the garden. It's time to

70
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,200
eat. It's raining. So I don't need to water it today. So I'm just getting the sniffs. Oh, also

71
00:05:53,200 --> 00:06:04,880
that's our new car guys. How do you like it? I like it. Yeah. Okay. So here we are.

72
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,240
Garden's looking okay. Maybe time to get that tomato over there. There's one giant cucumber

73
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,320
in the back. You see that? I'm grabbing that right now and I'm grabbing at least one pepper

74
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,720
because Dave's currently making us a big breakfast. I like a bunch of omelets and stuff,

75
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,080
mushrooms and stuff are going in it and we need a pepper. So it's pepper time. Let's just get in

76
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:35,440
there. There it is. And look at that. Yeah, man. Yep. And it's time for that big one to come now.

77
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:45,840
Finally. I just like twist it off. Ooh, it's really spiky. Come on. I'm just twisting it

78
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:56,640
till it pops off. Look at that. I'm going to get the tomato too. Oh, by the way, that one tomato

79
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,400
that I thought might've been rotten. I didn't get a chance to try it because Dave just like

80
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,160
scarfed it down. It's like, Oh, okay. Oh Dave, vegetable delivery.

81
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:19,520
I just want it done for now. They all gotta be washed. Okay. It is September 18th and usually

82
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,800
by now I'm starting to close up the garden because fall sets in, but you know what? We still have

83
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,880
summer weather. That's pretty nice. Now I didn't do any of that weeding that I wanted to do,

84
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,360
obviously. So, uh, oops. However, things are looking okay. There's a whole bunch more Swiss

85
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,360
chard. That's a ridiculous amount of chard. The pepper plants didn't actually give us very much.

86
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,280
We had like one big pepper out of each couple of small ones are coming in, but they're probably not

87
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,440
going to make it. You might have another couple of weeks of a good weather. So we'll see the beans.

88
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,320
That was a terrible idea. They didn't work out at all. There's a few tomatoes that are worth

89
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,560
grabbing, but the tomatoes are also way less than before. And then there's the cucumbers.

90
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,920
There's a weird cucumber right there and right there. It's like, Oh, okay. And there's that one

91
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:08,640
in there that I missed. You see it? It's huge. Oops. The strange thing though is, is that this

92
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:16,000
one vine right at the end of the year just took off up the lattice and across onto the deck. I

93
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,360
don't think any of those flowers are going to turn into anything, but it's funny that we got this

94
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,960
much vine out of it right at the end. Yeah. Normally I'd be closing the garden down by now,

95
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,000
but it probably has another week or two in it. I'm going to pull off those tomatoes that are

96
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,080
a little bit small, but they are going orange. So I'll pull them off. I'll pull off one of

97
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,880
those cucumbers for dinner tonight and probably some of the chard too. So I guess we'll just

98
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,240
see where this goes. It's the end of September guys, which means the end of the growing season.

99
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,800
However, it's actually been really warm, like surprisingly warm. The garden's in much better

100
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,400
shape right now compared to what it usually is. That being said, it still wasn't really a

101
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,080
successful garden though. We only got a couple of cucumbers. You only got a few good tomatoes.

102
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,400
You only got a few good peppers. The chard, however, has been amazing. We're having salad

103
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,320
tonight, which means I'm snipping some leaves. The leaves, here we go, just

104
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,440
I'll be using these for tonight's salad for dinner. With all of tonight's leaves grabbed,

105
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,800
I'm now going to see what else I can take. That is a decent sized pepper and this one is still

106
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,440
coming in, but I might wait a little bit more. There's two little guys coming in. They might not

107
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,960
go very far. I think I'll hold off on the peppers, see if I can gamble it. Maybe in a few more weeks

108
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,800
they won't get too much frost and they'll be bigger. This is like summer weather right now

109
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,880
guys, and it's the end of September. It's kind of wild. There's a few malformed cucumbers. I mean,

110
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,800
they're edible, but they're not great. There's that one there. There's that one there. Those

111
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,960
are some decent cucumbers. This huge vine is still doing its thing. Oh, there's one coming in there

112
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,520
too. Yeah, I'm not sure if these guys are actually even edible. They're kind of hard to be honest.

113
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,640
This guy is small, but good. There we go. As for the tomatoes, they really weren't a success this

114
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,840
year either. So I'm just going to pull off anything that's of a decent size, even though

115
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,440
it's still green. Like these aren't growing anymore. So like, there we go. I'll get these

116
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,840
two guys here. Yeah, here's a tiny one. It's not growing anymore either, unfortunately.

117
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,520
This one looks pretty good. Oh, it's all prickly. Oh, can you see those spines? Yeah.

118
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,680
All right, come on.

119
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,760
That's all right. This one's good too, though it's a little bit big.

120
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,720
There we go. Oh man, there's another big one too. You know what? They kind of get like woody and

121
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,560
seedy if you let them grow this big, but my dad likes big cucumbers, so maybe I'll just give these

122
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:38,480
to him. I didn't even notice this one back here. Let's snip it. Oh, I forgot gravity was a thing.

123
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,280
And there's everything I got out of the garden today. This has not been a successful garden.

124
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,520
Probably my worst garden since I started. That first year was pretty rough because I didn't

125
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,240
know what I was doing, but now it's getting pretty bad. Part of it is definitely going to be because

126
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't weed, but that'll only be a small part of it. Some people suggested that it's because

127
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,240
I'm burying them in their biodegradable little holders here, which might be the case. I don't

128
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,760
know. I mean, they are biodegradable. They do just kind of flake off and turn into earth. So

129
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,520
I figured they'd just be able to grow through them. Like that was the point of them, but maybe

130
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,640
not. Maybe it's too tough for them. That's why they're not actually accessing the manure that

131
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,560
I put in the hole. That could be a possibility. However, I have been gardening at this location

132
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,440
for five or six years now without any serious like manure refreshment. Yeah. I put a little

133
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,600
bit in sometimes, just my leftover manure. And I put in the compost from the composter back there,

134
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,000
but it might not be enough to keep the soil like fully rejuvenated. Anyway, even though this is

135
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,640
when I usually clean out the garden and close it up for the season, I'm going to probably leave it

136
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,200
like this, at least for a few more weeks. It's been abnormally warm, especially by Canadian

137
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,440
standards. So maybe I'll get a little bit more out of it. Maybe some of those cucumbers will come in.

138
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,400
Those peppers will probably keep growing there. I think the tomatoes are done. And definitely these

139
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,760
chards, like these leaves are great. They're still going despite everything else. They're pretty

140
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,280
hardy. So I might have one more update for you before I finally end things out for the year.

141
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,720
All right, guys, here's Naomi going full trad wife today, making the food. Look what I brought you,

142
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,400
Naomi. Oh, by the way, those tomatoes that I grabbed last time. Yeah. They're working out.

143
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:18,080
What do you think of them, Naomi? That's how tomatoes do. Yeah. Well, I just noticed that

144
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,400
cucumber I thought would be CD is not nearly as CD as I thought it would be. That's amazing.

145
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:30,400
The heat wave is coming to an end guys. This is today. And this is the next seven days,

146
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:37,040
32 down to what is that? Minus one. Yeah. It's getting pretty cold. I guess the garden's done.

147
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:44,880
It's October 8th guys. And it's currently really cold out. Can you hear the wind? This is a storm

148
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,600
right now, but it's like an ice storm. There is some rain, but not a lot of rain. We went from

149
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:56,400
summer conditions to extremely cold conditions and we're going to have ice tonight. So this is

150
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,120
the end of the garden pretty much. I've come down as always, I've kind of let it go in the

151
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,520
past few weeks knowing that ice was coming eventually and it's time to grab whatever

152
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,840
dregs. We've been eating the chard every day and it's still growing. Like how is it growing in the

153
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:19,440
cold? It's going though. We have a few peppers. Like here's a pepper right here. There we go.

154
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,480
Got caught in the scissors. There's a pepper here.

155
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,120
Yep. The final two peppers. Those look nice. Still like flowers for these guys. I don't think

156
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,080
they're going anywhere. There is that one though. Like look at this little guy. He's not going to

157
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:42,240
grow much more is he? I guess we'll see. Or that one. But this big one back here is doing pretty

158
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,880
well. Like he's just, he's just hanging. I don't think the scissors are going to do this time. I

159
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:57,360
have to like just pull it off. Just come on. There we go. Nice. Okay this is October 9th and

160
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,480
it turns out that I spoke too soon. Look at the snow. That rain we expected today, well it got

161
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,120
just a couple degrees colder and now it's snow which means that the garden is definitely done.

162
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,880
It's time to pull as many chard leaves out as we can and hope we can keep them alive in the fridge

163
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,360
for a while. I'm glad I grabbed those peppers yesterday because they're done and I guess those

164
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,920
tiny cucumbers as well. Also here's Dave coming outside. He's here to, he's here to help me out

165
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,880
with this endeavor. Also you're still sick. On the tail end of it. On the tail end of it. Also

166
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:34,160
like you're dressed up like super like winter time and I'm just like shorts giga chad. Maybe.

167
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,560
That is the early end of the garden this year. RIP. It's October. Yeah but usually, usually I

168
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,560
go till like the end of October. I can usually keep growing but not this year. We got an early

169
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,320
snow. This year has been kind of schizophrenic. Dude I can't wait for us to have snow for the

170
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,600
next five months. I just noticed guys there's like a single pepper out here. Oops hope it's still

171
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,520
good. Yeah here's the final dregs. Three tiny tomatoes, two tiny cucumbers and one medium-sized

172
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:09,440
pepper. Now for all this chard. I have a feeling most of it will go bad because this is coming on

173
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,480
way too fast but we'll do our best to keep it alive I guess. Alright I've harvested all the

174
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,000
edible chard and look at these chard roots dude. They're huge. Alright Dave and I have finished

175
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
yanking everything out of the garden. We have two full bowls of chard to go wash and that's it.

176
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,680
That's it for this year's garden. Um the plans next year if we're still here because we might

177
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,160
be moving but I don't think I'm doing a garden next year. I know lots of people said that it

178
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,360
was because I buried the plants wrong with those uh biodegradable cups. That's probably partially

179
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,360
it but also the soil has definitely become more depleted. I mean this garden is now seven or eight

180
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,160
years old so I think it might be time if I'm gonna stay here for at least two more years which is

181
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,600
very unlikely but if I do next year I'm going to solarize the garden instead and that'll be a whole

182
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,040
process. It's something that you should do due to your garden every once in a while especially if

183
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,240
you're taking a year off so I don't know if there is a garden video next year it'll just be me

184
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,600
solarizing it but I might actually be moving so maybe it's all a moot point. Anyway that's it for

185
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,360
uh this year's garden escapades. Oh well didn't get as much as previous years but as our good

186
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,000
friend Sonic the Hedgehog says Dave you live and learn.

187
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,000
do

188
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,620
you
