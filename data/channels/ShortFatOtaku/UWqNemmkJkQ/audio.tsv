0	5680	Good morning, friends. The second week of August, sounds like there's a pressure washer going off
5680	10960	and the neighbor in the back, but I'm out here to water and it's garden time.
10960	14720	Into the old shed once again. Put the scissors somewhere easier to get.
14720	18320	And the watering can. Look at that juicy pepper over there, man.
18320	21840	And this one, like it's finally coming through.
21840	25360	Tomatoes are looking good. Cucumbers are going. Look at them grow up the vine.
25920	29520	Except for that one. I mean that middle one's coming back. Maybe it'll work out.
29520	34960	Now someone in the comments of the last video told me that these peas were not vine peas.
34960	41360	They were in fact just bush peas. So they're not growing up. That kind of sucks.
41360	45360	But the peas are good. I'm going to need a bunch of this chard.
45360	49200	Yes, I said it charred properly this time. It's charred, not kale.
49200	53280	I need a bunch of it this time because it kind of sucks to say,
53280	57280	but our car is having an issue right now. It's currently in the garage.
57280	59760	So what that means is we're not going grocery shopping for a little bit,
60400	64560	which means we're eating these garden greens. So I'm getting a whole bunch of them for tonight's
64560	68800	dinner. One thing I found is if you want to keep these leaves going for like more than just a
68800	74080	couple hours, the best thing you can do is fill up a glass with a little bit of water
74960	79840	and stick them in the glass. So stay alive in the fridge like that for an extra day or two.
79840	86640	And there we go. The garden is watered and everything that I need for tonight
87840	95120	is harvested. There's like six leaves I think and a whole bunch of beans. I might have said peas
95120	100080	last time accidentally. It's beans, it's beans. Man, they always crucify me every single time I
100080	104560	get something wrong. I'm definitely getting less out of this spot with the beans than I was with
104560	108320	the peas in previous years. Especially since they didn't grow up the lattice, I thought they would.
108320	112400	So I don't know. I'd probably just go back to peas if I had to do it again.
112400	115680	By the way, here's what I was talking about with the chard. These leaves,
115680	119840	I picked them almost a week ago and they're still pretty good. I cut the ends so that
119840	123680	water can get in just like you would with, you know, flowers that you give to a girl or something.
123680	128480	Stood them up with just a little bit of water in the glass. Stuck them in there like so. Put them
128480	132880	in the fridge. Actually these ones here, the ones that I just cut, they're actually more limp than
132880	136800	the ones in here. So I'll probably like get a cleaner cut on the bottom and then put them in
136800	141920	here. So because the fridge is only so high, I do want them to be relatively the same height
141920	146000	if possible, which does mean losing some stem. And the stem is actually a pretty healthy part.
146000	151280	That's unfortunate, but that's how it is. I guess I'll just do like right here.
153520	159360	There we go. And all of this into the glass. Just a little bit of water, not much.
160240	165680	And that'll do it. In the fridge it goes. Yeah man, it just barely fits. Oh, by the way,
166320	169200	yes Canada does have bagged milk. You know what though?
169200	178720	The tomato still isn't ripening or softening up. It's been a couple of weeks now. Hmm,
178720	183680	something might be wrong. It's the second week of August and you know what guys?
184240	190000	We've had so much rain that I haven't had to really water the garden that much at all.
190000	194240	But as you can see down there, some of those leaves and the cucumbers right over there,
194240	196720	they're starting to go yellow. I think that means too much rain.
197840	203840	Ooh, there's thunder. It's actually picking up. Wow. Wow. At least there's no laundry on the line
203840	209280	this time. I wonder how our bird friends are doing. We're about halfway through August and
209280	213760	things are developing pretty quick. The pepper plants are starting to boom. There's a few
214320	220880	decent peppers in there. You see? Yeah. A couple of the tomatoes starting to go red over there.
220880	225040	Look at that. First big cucumber. Our bird friends aren't home today. Also,
225040	230160	it looks like something's digging in the garden because that tinier not making a cucumber plant.
230160	234400	Yeah. It got some dirt sprayed on it. Oh well. Yeah. I was thinking I was going to pick it,
234400	238000	but I don't think it's ready. If it's not ready, don't worry about it.
238000	241520	Yeah. That's my mom, by the way. She's visiting. Oh.
243600	248720	The tomatoes are starting to come in though. Look at that. That tomato is turning yellow,
248720	252080	but this doesn't look like it's ripening. This looks like it's rotting. Oh well.
252080	256240	I guess we'll see how it turns out. Hello. It's the end of August. I'm out here to
257040	262960	water once again. By the way, yes, I did fix my watering can with Flex Seal.
262960	268240	This chard just keeps coming back, man. It just keeps coming back. We haven't really had to buy
268240	271920	much lettuce this summer. The peppers are getting big. You can probably take that one off right now
271920	276800	actually. They're pretty big. And some new blooms are coming in too. Oh, we had to use the ladder
276800	281920	at one point. So no more bird's nest. They had moved on though at that point. Don't worry. We
281920	286800	didn't, we didn't massacre any birds. The birds had moved on. The peas ended up being a big waste.
288240	291840	Only got a little bit out of them. Oh well. It's always good to try new things.
291840	296480	Oops. Looks like an animal got at one of the tomatoes. There are several ripe ones though.
296480	300720	These cucumbers are definitely big enough to eat. Look at this vine. It's going all the way up.
300720	311760	And then there. Yeah. I'll grab the tomatoes before something else happens to them. Ah, come
311760	321520	on. There we go. Brought this stuff to the kitchen and just realized a tomato from a few days ago.
321520	327840	It is getting wrinkly. So it's definitely like aging, but it's also turning red. I wonder how
327840	331520	this one's going to turn out. It's been a few more days and take a look at it. It actually
332080	337120	turned red. I'm very surprised. I actually expected it to rot. I've had green tomatoes go
337120	341360	from green to Brown before, but this one's actually red. Maybe it's edible. I guess we'll
341360	346960	see. August 29th. I need to start getting some of these vegetables out of the garden. It's time to
346960	353200	eat. It's raining. So I don't need to water it today. So I'm just getting the sniffs. Oh, also
353200	364880	that's our new car guys. How do you like it? I like it. Yeah. Okay. So here we are.
366160	372240	Garden's looking okay. Maybe time to get that tomato over there. There's one giant cucumber
372240	376320	in the back. You see that? I'm grabbing that right now and I'm grabbing at least one pepper
376320	380720	because Dave's currently making us a big breakfast. I like a bunch of omelets and stuff,
380720	386080	mushrooms and stuff are going in it and we need a pepper. So it's pepper time. Let's just get in
386080	395440	there. There it is. And look at that. Yeah, man. Yep. And it's time for that big one to come now.
395440	405840	Finally. I just like twist it off. Ooh, it's really spiky. Come on. I'm just twisting it
405840	416640	till it pops off. Look at that. I'm going to get the tomato too. Oh, by the way, that one tomato
416640	420400	that I thought might've been rotten. I didn't get a chance to try it because Dave just like
420400	426160	scarfed it down. It's like, Oh, okay. Oh Dave, vegetable delivery.
426160	439520	I just want it done for now. They all gotta be washed. Okay. It is September 18th and usually
439520	446800	by now I'm starting to close up the garden because fall sets in, but you know what? We still have
446800	450880	summer weather. That's pretty nice. Now I didn't do any of that weeding that I wanted to do,
450880	457360	obviously. So, uh, oops. However, things are looking okay. There's a whole bunch more Swiss
457360	461360	chard. That's a ridiculous amount of chard. The pepper plants didn't actually give us very much.
461360	465280	We had like one big pepper out of each couple of small ones are coming in, but they're probably not
465280	469440	going to make it. You might have another couple of weeks of a good weather. So we'll see the beans.
469440	472320	That was a terrible idea. They didn't work out at all. There's a few tomatoes that are worth
472320	476560	grabbing, but the tomatoes are also way less than before. And then there's the cucumbers.
477040	481920	There's a weird cucumber right there and right there. It's like, Oh, okay. And there's that one
481920	488640	in there that I missed. You see it? It's huge. Oops. The strange thing though is, is that this
488640	496000	one vine right at the end of the year just took off up the lattice and across onto the deck. I
496000	499360	don't think any of those flowers are going to turn into anything, but it's funny that we got this
499360	502960	much vine out of it right at the end. Yeah. Normally I'd be closing the garden down by now,
502960	508000	but it probably has another week or two in it. I'm going to pull off those tomatoes that are
508000	512080	a little bit small, but they are going orange. So I'll pull them off. I'll pull off one of
512080	516880	those cucumbers for dinner tonight and probably some of the chard too. So I guess we'll just
516880	522240	see where this goes. It's the end of September guys, which means the end of the growing season.
522240	526800	However, it's actually been really warm, like surprisingly warm. The garden's in much better
526800	530400	shape right now compared to what it usually is. That being said, it still wasn't really a
530400	534080	successful garden though. We only got a couple of cucumbers. You only got a few good tomatoes.
534080	538400	You only got a few good peppers. The chard, however, has been amazing. We're having salad
538400	544320	tonight, which means I'm snipping some leaves. The leaves, here we go, just
545840	551440	I'll be using these for tonight's salad for dinner. With all of tonight's leaves grabbed,
551440	556800	I'm now going to see what else I can take. That is a decent sized pepper and this one is still
556880	561440	coming in, but I might wait a little bit more. There's two little guys coming in. They might not
561440	564960	go very far. I think I'll hold off on the peppers, see if I can gamble it. Maybe in a few more weeks
564960	568800	they won't get too much frost and they'll be bigger. This is like summer weather right now
568800	572880	guys, and it's the end of September. It's kind of wild. There's a few malformed cucumbers. I mean,
572880	576800	they're edible, but they're not great. There's that one there. There's that one there. Those
576800	580960	are some decent cucumbers. This huge vine is still doing its thing. Oh, there's one coming in there
580960	585520	too. Yeah, I'm not sure if these guys are actually even edible. They're kind of hard to be honest.
585520	590640	This guy is small, but good. There we go. As for the tomatoes, they really weren't a success this
590640	593840	year either. So I'm just going to pull off anything that's of a decent size, even though
593840	599440	it's still green. Like these aren't growing anymore. So like, there we go. I'll get these
599440	603840	two guys here. Yeah, here's a tiny one. It's not growing anymore either, unfortunately.
603840	609520	This one looks pretty good. Oh, it's all prickly. Oh, can you see those spines? Yeah.
610080	611680	All right, come on.
617120	619760	That's all right. This one's good too, though it's a little bit big.
621680	626720	There we go. Oh man, there's another big one too. You know what? They kind of get like woody and
626720	630560	seedy if you let them grow this big, but my dad likes big cucumbers, so maybe I'll just give these
630560	638480	to him. I didn't even notice this one back here. Let's snip it. Oh, I forgot gravity was a thing.
638480	643280	And there's everything I got out of the garden today. This has not been a successful garden.
643280	647520	Probably my worst garden since I started. That first year was pretty rough because I didn't
647520	652240	know what I was doing, but now it's getting pretty bad. Part of it is definitely going to be because
652240	656000	I don't weed, but that'll only be a small part of it. Some people suggested that it's because
656000	662240	I'm burying them in their biodegradable little holders here, which might be the case. I don't
662240	665760	know. I mean, they are biodegradable. They do just kind of flake off and turn into earth. So
665760	669520	I figured they'd just be able to grow through them. Like that was the point of them, but maybe
669520	672640	not. Maybe it's too tough for them. That's why they're not actually accessing the manure that
672640	676560	I put in the hole. That could be a possibility. However, I have been gardening at this location
676560	681440	for five or six years now without any serious like manure refreshment. Yeah. I put a little
681440	685600	bit in sometimes, just my leftover manure. And I put in the compost from the composter back there,
685600	690000	but it might not be enough to keep the soil like fully rejuvenated. Anyway, even though this is
690000	694640	when I usually clean out the garden and close it up for the season, I'm going to probably leave it
694640	699200	like this, at least for a few more weeks. It's been abnormally warm, especially by Canadian
699200	703440	standards. So maybe I'll get a little bit more out of it. Maybe some of those cucumbers will come in.
703440	708400	Those peppers will probably keep growing there. I think the tomatoes are done. And definitely these
708400	711760	chards, like these leaves are great. They're still going despite everything else. They're pretty
711760	717280	hardy. So I might have one more update for you before I finally end things out for the year.
717280	722720	All right, guys, here's Naomi going full trad wife today, making the food. Look what I brought you,
722720	728400	Naomi. Oh, by the way, those tomatoes that I grabbed last time. Yeah. They're working out.
728400	738080	What do you think of them, Naomi? That's how tomatoes do. Yeah. Well, I just noticed that
738080	742400	cucumber I thought would be CD is not nearly as CD as I thought it would be. That's amazing.
744080	750400	The heat wave is coming to an end guys. This is today. And this is the next seven days,
750400	757040	32 down to what is that? Minus one. Yeah. It's getting pretty cold. I guess the garden's done.
757600	764880	It's October 8th guys. And it's currently really cold out. Can you hear the wind? This is a storm
764880	769600	right now, but it's like an ice storm. There is some rain, but not a lot of rain. We went from
770400	776400	summer conditions to extremely cold conditions and we're going to have ice tonight. So this is
776400	781120	the end of the garden pretty much. I've come down as always, I've kind of let it go in the
781120	785520	past few weeks knowing that ice was coming eventually and it's time to grab whatever
786400	791840	dregs. We've been eating the chard every day and it's still growing. Like how is it growing in the
791840	799440	cold? It's going though. We have a few peppers. Like here's a pepper right here. There we go.
800240	802480	Got caught in the scissors. There's a pepper here.
804720	811120	Yep. The final two peppers. Those look nice. Still like flowers for these guys. I don't think
811120	816080	they're going anywhere. There is that one though. Like look at this little guy. He's not going to
816080	822240	grow much more is he? I guess we'll see. Or that one. But this big one back here is doing pretty
822240	826880	well. Like he's just, he's just hanging. I don't think the scissors are going to do this time. I
826880	837360	have to like just pull it off. Just come on. There we go. Nice. Okay this is October 9th and
837360	842480	it turns out that I spoke too soon. Look at the snow. That rain we expected today, well it got
842480	847120	just a couple degrees colder and now it's snow which means that the garden is definitely done.
847120	852880	It's time to pull as many chard leaves out as we can and hope we can keep them alive in the fridge
852880	857360	for a while. I'm glad I grabbed those peppers yesterday because they're done and I guess those
857360	861920	tiny cucumbers as well. Also here's Dave coming outside. He's here to, he's here to help me out
861920	866880	with this endeavor. Also you're still sick. On the tail end of it. On the tail end of it. Also
866880	874160	like you're dressed up like super like winter time and I'm just like shorts giga chad. Maybe.
874160	880560	That is the early end of the garden this year. RIP. It's October. Yeah but usually, usually I
880560	884560	go till like the end of October. I can usually keep growing but not this year. We got an early
884560	890320	snow. This year has been kind of schizophrenic. Dude I can't wait for us to have snow for the
890320	895600	next five months. I just noticed guys there's like a single pepper out here. Oops hope it's still
895600	901520	good. Yeah here's the final dregs. Three tiny tomatoes, two tiny cucumbers and one medium-sized
901520	909440	pepper. Now for all this chard. I have a feeling most of it will go bad because this is coming on
909440	914480	way too fast but we'll do our best to keep it alive I guess. Alright I've harvested all the
914480	920000	edible chard and look at these chard roots dude. They're huge. Alright Dave and I have finished
920000	926000	yanking everything out of the garden. We have two full bowls of chard to go wash and that's it.
926000	931680	That's it for this year's garden. Um the plans next year if we're still here because we might
931680	936160	be moving but I don't think I'm doing a garden next year. I know lots of people said that it
936160	941360	was because I buried the plants wrong with those uh biodegradable cups. That's probably partially
941360	945360	it but also the soil has definitely become more depleted. I mean this garden is now seven or eight
945360	950160	years old so I think it might be time if I'm gonna stay here for at least two more years which is
950160	955600	very unlikely but if I do next year I'm going to solarize the garden instead and that'll be a whole
955600	959040	process. It's something that you should do due to your garden every once in a while especially if
959040	964240	you're taking a year off so I don't know if there is a garden video next year it'll just be me
964240	969600	solarizing it but I might actually be moving so maybe it's all a moot point. Anyway that's it for
969600	975360	uh this year's garden escapades. Oh well didn't get as much as previous years but as our good
975360	978000	friend Sonic the Hedgehog says Dave you live and learn.
994240	998000	do
1005120	1005620	you
