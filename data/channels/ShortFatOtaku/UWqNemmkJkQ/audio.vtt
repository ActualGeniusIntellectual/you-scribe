00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Good morning, friends. The second week of August, sounds like there's a pressure washer going off

00:05.680 --> 00:10.960
and the neighbor in the back, but I'm out here to water and it's garden time.

00:10.960 --> 00:14.720
Into the old shed once again. Put the scissors somewhere easier to get.

00:14.720 --> 00:18.320
And the watering can. Look at that juicy pepper over there, man.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.840
And this one, like it's finally coming through.

00:21.840 --> 00:25.360
Tomatoes are looking good. Cucumbers are going. Look at them grow up the vine.

00:25.920 --> 00:29.520
Except for that one. I mean that middle one's coming back. Maybe it'll work out.

00:29.520 --> 00:34.960
Now someone in the comments of the last video told me that these peas were not vine peas.

00:34.960 --> 00:41.360
They were in fact just bush peas. So they're not growing up. That kind of sucks.

00:41.360 --> 00:45.360
But the peas are good. I'm going to need a bunch of this chard.

00:45.360 --> 00:49.200
Yes, I said it charred properly this time. It's charred, not kale.

00:49.200 --> 00:53.280
I need a bunch of it this time because it kind of sucks to say,

00:53.280 --> 00:57.280
but our car is having an issue right now. It's currently in the garage.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.760
So what that means is we're not going grocery shopping for a little bit,

01:00.400 --> 01:04.560
which means we're eating these garden greens. So I'm getting a whole bunch of them for tonight's

01:04.560 --> 01:08.800
dinner. One thing I found is if you want to keep these leaves going for like more than just a

01:08.800 --> 01:14.080
couple hours, the best thing you can do is fill up a glass with a little bit of water

01:14.960 --> 01:19.840
and stick them in the glass. So stay alive in the fridge like that for an extra day or two.

01:19.840 --> 01:26.640
And there we go. The garden is watered and everything that I need for tonight

01:27.840 --> 01:35.120
is harvested. There's like six leaves I think and a whole bunch of beans. I might have said peas

01:35.120 --> 01:40.080
last time accidentally. It's beans, it's beans. Man, they always crucify me every single time I

01:40.080 --> 01:44.560
get something wrong. I'm definitely getting less out of this spot with the beans than I was with

01:44.560 --> 01:48.320
the peas in previous years. Especially since they didn't grow up the lattice, I thought they would.

01:48.320 --> 01:52.400
So I don't know. I'd probably just go back to peas if I had to do it again.

01:52.400 --> 01:55.680
By the way, here's what I was talking about with the chard. These leaves,

01:55.680 --> 01:59.840
I picked them almost a week ago and they're still pretty good. I cut the ends so that

01:59.840 --> 02:03.680
water can get in just like you would with, you know, flowers that you give to a girl or something.

02:03.680 --> 02:08.480
Stood them up with just a little bit of water in the glass. Stuck them in there like so. Put them

02:08.480 --> 02:12.880
in the fridge. Actually these ones here, the ones that I just cut, they're actually more limp than

02:12.880 --> 02:16.800
the ones in here. So I'll probably like get a cleaner cut on the bottom and then put them in

02:16.800 --> 02:21.920
here. So because the fridge is only so high, I do want them to be relatively the same height

02:21.920 --> 02:26.000
if possible, which does mean losing some stem. And the stem is actually a pretty healthy part.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.280
That's unfortunate, but that's how it is. I guess I'll just do like right here.

02:33.520 --> 02:39.360
There we go. And all of this into the glass. Just a little bit of water, not much.

02:40.240 --> 02:45.680
And that'll do it. In the fridge it goes. Yeah man, it just barely fits. Oh, by the way,

02:46.320 --> 02:49.200
yes Canada does have bagged milk. You know what though?

02:49.200 --> 02:58.720
The tomato still isn't ripening or softening up. It's been a couple of weeks now. Hmm,

02:58.720 --> 03:03.680
something might be wrong. It's the second week of August and you know what guys?

03:04.240 --> 03:10.000
We've had so much rain that I haven't had to really water the garden that much at all.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.240
But as you can see down there, some of those leaves and the cucumbers right over there,

03:14.240 --> 03:16.720
they're starting to go yellow. I think that means too much rain.

03:17.840 --> 03:23.840
Ooh, there's thunder. It's actually picking up. Wow. Wow. At least there's no laundry on the line

03:23.840 --> 03:29.280
this time. I wonder how our bird friends are doing. We're about halfway through August and

03:29.280 --> 03:33.760
things are developing pretty quick. The pepper plants are starting to boom. There's a few

03:34.320 --> 03:40.880
decent peppers in there. You see? Yeah. A couple of the tomatoes starting to go red over there.

03:40.880 --> 03:45.040
Look at that. First big cucumber. Our bird friends aren't home today. Also,

03:45.040 --> 03:50.160
it looks like something's digging in the garden because that tinier not making a cucumber plant.

03:50.160 --> 03:54.400
Yeah. It got some dirt sprayed on it. Oh well. Yeah. I was thinking I was going to pick it,

03:54.400 --> 03:58.000
but I don't think it's ready. If it's not ready, don't worry about it.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.520
Yeah. That's my mom, by the way. She's visiting. Oh.

04:03.600 --> 04:08.720
The tomatoes are starting to come in though. Look at that. That tomato is turning yellow,

04:08.720 --> 04:12.080
but this doesn't look like it's ripening. This looks like it's rotting. Oh well.

04:12.080 --> 04:16.240
I guess we'll see how it turns out. Hello. It's the end of August. I'm out here to

04:17.040 --> 04:22.960
water once again. By the way, yes, I did fix my watering can with Flex Seal.

04:22.960 --> 04:28.240
This chard just keeps coming back, man. It just keeps coming back. We haven't really had to buy

04:28.240 --> 04:31.920
much lettuce this summer. The peppers are getting big. You can probably take that one off right now

04:31.920 --> 04:36.800
actually. They're pretty big. And some new blooms are coming in too. Oh, we had to use the ladder

04:36.800 --> 04:41.920
at one point. So no more bird's nest. They had moved on though at that point. Don't worry. We

04:41.920 --> 04:46.800
didn't, we didn't massacre any birds. The birds had moved on. The peas ended up being a big waste.

04:48.240 --> 04:51.840
Only got a little bit out of them. Oh well. It's always good to try new things.

04:51.840 --> 04:56.480
Oops. Looks like an animal got at one of the tomatoes. There are several ripe ones though.

04:56.480 --> 05:00.720
These cucumbers are definitely big enough to eat. Look at this vine. It's going all the way up.

05:00.720 --> 05:11.760
And then there. Yeah. I'll grab the tomatoes before something else happens to them. Ah, come

05:11.760 --> 05:21.520
on. There we go. Brought this stuff to the kitchen and just realized a tomato from a few days ago.

05:21.520 --> 05:27.840
It is getting wrinkly. So it's definitely like aging, but it's also turning red. I wonder how

05:27.840 --> 05:31.520
this one's going to turn out. It's been a few more days and take a look at it. It actually

05:32.080 --> 05:37.120
turned red. I'm very surprised. I actually expected it to rot. I've had green tomatoes go

05:37.120 --> 05:41.360
from green to Brown before, but this one's actually red. Maybe it's edible. I guess we'll

05:41.360 --> 05:46.960
see. August 29th. I need to start getting some of these vegetables out of the garden. It's time to

05:46.960 --> 05:53.200
eat. It's raining. So I don't need to water it today. So I'm just getting the sniffs. Oh, also

05:53.200 --> 06:04.880
that's our new car guys. How do you like it? I like it. Yeah. Okay. So here we are.

06:06.160 --> 06:12.240
Garden's looking okay. Maybe time to get that tomato over there. There's one giant cucumber

06:12.240 --> 06:16.320
in the back. You see that? I'm grabbing that right now and I'm grabbing at least one pepper

06:16.320 --> 06:20.720
because Dave's currently making us a big breakfast. I like a bunch of omelets and stuff,

06:20.720 --> 06:26.080
mushrooms and stuff are going in it and we need a pepper. So it's pepper time. Let's just get in

06:26.080 --> 06:35.440
there. There it is. And look at that. Yeah, man. Yep. And it's time for that big one to come now.

06:35.440 --> 06:45.840
Finally. I just like twist it off. Ooh, it's really spiky. Come on. I'm just twisting it

06:45.840 --> 06:56.640
till it pops off. Look at that. I'm going to get the tomato too. Oh, by the way, that one tomato

06:56.640 --> 07:00.400
that I thought might've been rotten. I didn't get a chance to try it because Dave just like

07:00.400 --> 07:06.160
scarfed it down. It's like, Oh, okay. Oh Dave, vegetable delivery.

07:06.160 --> 07:19.520
I just want it done for now. They all gotta be washed. Okay. It is September 18th and usually

07:19.520 --> 07:26.800
by now I'm starting to close up the garden because fall sets in, but you know what? We still have

07:26.800 --> 07:30.880
summer weather. That's pretty nice. Now I didn't do any of that weeding that I wanted to do,

07:30.880 --> 07:37.360
obviously. So, uh, oops. However, things are looking okay. There's a whole bunch more Swiss

07:37.360 --> 07:41.360
chard. That's a ridiculous amount of chard. The pepper plants didn't actually give us very much.

07:41.360 --> 07:45.280
We had like one big pepper out of each couple of small ones are coming in, but they're probably not

07:45.280 --> 07:49.440
going to make it. You might have another couple of weeks of a good weather. So we'll see the beans.

07:49.440 --> 07:52.320
That was a terrible idea. They didn't work out at all. There's a few tomatoes that are worth

07:52.320 --> 07:56.560
grabbing, but the tomatoes are also way less than before. And then there's the cucumbers.

07:57.040 --> 08:01.920
There's a weird cucumber right there and right there. It's like, Oh, okay. And there's that one

08:01.920 --> 08:08.640
in there that I missed. You see it? It's huge. Oops. The strange thing though is, is that this

08:08.640 --> 08:16.000
one vine right at the end of the year just took off up the lattice and across onto the deck. I

08:16.000 --> 08:19.360
don't think any of those flowers are going to turn into anything, but it's funny that we got this

08:19.360 --> 08:22.960
much vine out of it right at the end. Yeah. Normally I'd be closing the garden down by now,

08:22.960 --> 08:28.000
but it probably has another week or two in it. I'm going to pull off those tomatoes that are

08:28.000 --> 08:32.080
a little bit small, but they are going orange. So I'll pull them off. I'll pull off one of

08:32.080 --> 08:36.880
those cucumbers for dinner tonight and probably some of the chard too. So I guess we'll just

08:36.880 --> 08:42.240
see where this goes. It's the end of September guys, which means the end of the growing season.

08:42.240 --> 08:46.800
However, it's actually been really warm, like surprisingly warm. The garden's in much better

08:46.800 --> 08:50.400
shape right now compared to what it usually is. That being said, it still wasn't really a

08:50.400 --> 08:54.080
successful garden though. We only got a couple of cucumbers. You only got a few good tomatoes.

08:54.080 --> 08:58.400
You only got a few good peppers. The chard, however, has been amazing. We're having salad

08:58.400 --> 09:04.320
tonight, which means I'm snipping some leaves. The leaves, here we go, just

09:05.840 --> 09:11.440
I'll be using these for tonight's salad for dinner. With all of tonight's leaves grabbed,

09:11.440 --> 09:16.800
I'm now going to see what else I can take. That is a decent sized pepper and this one is still

09:16.880 --> 09:21.440
coming in, but I might wait a little bit more. There's two little guys coming in. They might not

09:21.440 --> 09:24.960
go very far. I think I'll hold off on the peppers, see if I can gamble it. Maybe in a few more weeks

09:24.960 --> 09:28.800
they won't get too much frost and they'll be bigger. This is like summer weather right now

09:28.800 --> 09:32.880
guys, and it's the end of September. It's kind of wild. There's a few malformed cucumbers. I mean,

09:32.880 --> 09:36.800
they're edible, but they're not great. There's that one there. There's that one there. Those

09:36.800 --> 09:40.960
are some decent cucumbers. This huge vine is still doing its thing. Oh, there's one coming in there

09:40.960 --> 09:45.520
too. Yeah, I'm not sure if these guys are actually even edible. They're kind of hard to be honest.

09:45.520 --> 09:50.640
This guy is small, but good. There we go. As for the tomatoes, they really weren't a success this

09:50.640 --> 09:53.840
year either. So I'm just going to pull off anything that's of a decent size, even though

09:53.840 --> 09:59.440
it's still green. Like these aren't growing anymore. So like, there we go. I'll get these

09:59.440 --> 10:03.840
two guys here. Yeah, here's a tiny one. It's not growing anymore either, unfortunately.

10:03.840 --> 10:09.520
This one looks pretty good. Oh, it's all prickly. Oh, can you see those spines? Yeah.

10:10.080 --> 10:11.680
All right, come on.

10:17.120 --> 10:19.760
That's all right. This one's good too, though it's a little bit big.

10:21.680 --> 10:26.720
There we go. Oh man, there's another big one too. You know what? They kind of get like woody and

10:26.720 --> 10:30.560
seedy if you let them grow this big, but my dad likes big cucumbers, so maybe I'll just give these

10:30.560 --> 10:38.480
to him. I didn't even notice this one back here. Let's snip it. Oh, I forgot gravity was a thing.

10:38.480 --> 10:43.280
And there's everything I got out of the garden today. This has not been a successful garden.

10:43.280 --> 10:47.520
Probably my worst garden since I started. That first year was pretty rough because I didn't

10:47.520 --> 10:52.240
know what I was doing, but now it's getting pretty bad. Part of it is definitely going to be because

10:52.240 --> 10:56.000
I don't weed, but that'll only be a small part of it. Some people suggested that it's because

10:56.000 --> 11:02.240
I'm burying them in their biodegradable little holders here, which might be the case. I don't

11:02.240 --> 11:05.760
know. I mean, they are biodegradable. They do just kind of flake off and turn into earth. So

11:05.760 --> 11:09.520
I figured they'd just be able to grow through them. Like that was the point of them, but maybe

11:09.520 --> 11:12.640
not. Maybe it's too tough for them. That's why they're not actually accessing the manure that

11:12.640 --> 11:16.560
I put in the hole. That could be a possibility. However, I have been gardening at this location

11:16.560 --> 11:21.440
for five or six years now without any serious like manure refreshment. Yeah. I put a little

11:21.440 --> 11:25.600
bit in sometimes, just my leftover manure. And I put in the compost from the composter back there,

11:25.600 --> 11:30.000
but it might not be enough to keep the soil like fully rejuvenated. Anyway, even though this is

11:30.000 --> 11:34.640
when I usually clean out the garden and close it up for the season, I'm going to probably leave it

11:34.640 --> 11:39.200
like this, at least for a few more weeks. It's been abnormally warm, especially by Canadian

11:39.200 --> 11:43.440
standards. So maybe I'll get a little bit more out of it. Maybe some of those cucumbers will come in.

11:43.440 --> 11:48.400
Those peppers will probably keep growing there. I think the tomatoes are done. And definitely these

11:48.400 --> 11:51.760
chards, like these leaves are great. They're still going despite everything else. They're pretty

11:51.760 --> 11:57.280
hardy. So I might have one more update for you before I finally end things out for the year.

11:57.280 --> 12:02.720
All right, guys, here's Naomi going full trad wife today, making the food. Look what I brought you,

12:02.720 --> 12:08.400
Naomi. Oh, by the way, those tomatoes that I grabbed last time. Yeah. They're working out.

12:08.400 --> 12:18.080
What do you think of them, Naomi? That's how tomatoes do. Yeah. Well, I just noticed that

12:18.080 --> 12:22.400
cucumber I thought would be CD is not nearly as CD as I thought it would be. That's amazing.

12:24.080 --> 12:30.400
The heat wave is coming to an end guys. This is today. And this is the next seven days,

12:30.400 --> 12:37.040
32 down to what is that? Minus one. Yeah. It's getting pretty cold. I guess the garden's done.

12:37.600 --> 12:44.880
It's October 8th guys. And it's currently really cold out. Can you hear the wind? This is a storm

12:44.880 --> 12:49.600
right now, but it's like an ice storm. There is some rain, but not a lot of rain. We went from

12:50.400 --> 12:56.400
summer conditions to extremely cold conditions and we're going to have ice tonight. So this is

12:56.400 --> 13:01.120
the end of the garden pretty much. I've come down as always, I've kind of let it go in the

13:01.120 --> 13:05.520
past few weeks knowing that ice was coming eventually and it's time to grab whatever

13:06.400 --> 13:11.840
dregs. We've been eating the chard every day and it's still growing. Like how is it growing in the

13:11.840 --> 13:19.440
cold? It's going though. We have a few peppers. Like here's a pepper right here. There we go.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.480
Got caught in the scissors. There's a pepper here.

13:24.720 --> 13:31.120
Yep. The final two peppers. Those look nice. Still like flowers for these guys. I don't think

13:31.120 --> 13:36.080
they're going anywhere. There is that one though. Like look at this little guy. He's not going to

13:36.080 --> 13:42.240
grow much more is he? I guess we'll see. Or that one. But this big one back here is doing pretty

13:42.240 --> 13:46.880
well. Like he's just, he's just hanging. I don't think the scissors are going to do this time. I

13:46.880 --> 13:57.360
have to like just pull it off. Just come on. There we go. Nice. Okay this is October 9th and

13:57.360 --> 14:02.480
it turns out that I spoke too soon. Look at the snow. That rain we expected today, well it got

14:02.480 --> 14:07.120
just a couple degrees colder and now it's snow which means that the garden is definitely done.

14:07.120 --> 14:12.880
It's time to pull as many chard leaves out as we can and hope we can keep them alive in the fridge

14:12.880 --> 14:17.360
for a while. I'm glad I grabbed those peppers yesterday because they're done and I guess those

14:17.360 --> 14:21.920
tiny cucumbers as well. Also here's Dave coming outside. He's here to, he's here to help me out

14:21.920 --> 14:26.880
with this endeavor. Also you're still sick. On the tail end of it. On the tail end of it. Also

14:26.880 --> 14:34.160
like you're dressed up like super like winter time and I'm just like shorts giga chad. Maybe.

14:34.160 --> 14:40.560
That is the early end of the garden this year. RIP. It's October. Yeah but usually, usually I

14:40.560 --> 14:44.560
go till like the end of October. I can usually keep growing but not this year. We got an early

14:44.560 --> 14:50.320
snow. This year has been kind of schizophrenic. Dude I can't wait for us to have snow for the

14:50.320 --> 14:55.600
next five months. I just noticed guys there's like a single pepper out here. Oops hope it's still

14:55.600 --> 15:01.520
good. Yeah here's the final dregs. Three tiny tomatoes, two tiny cucumbers and one medium-sized

15:01.520 --> 15:09.440
pepper. Now for all this chard. I have a feeling most of it will go bad because this is coming on

15:09.440 --> 15:14.480
way too fast but we'll do our best to keep it alive I guess. Alright I've harvested all the

15:14.480 --> 15:20.000
edible chard and look at these chard roots dude. They're huge. Alright Dave and I have finished

15:20.000 --> 15:26.000
yanking everything out of the garden. We have two full bowls of chard to go wash and that's it.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.680
That's it for this year's garden. Um the plans next year if we're still here because we might

15:31.680 --> 15:36.160
be moving but I don't think I'm doing a garden next year. I know lots of people said that it

15:36.160 --> 15:41.360
was because I buried the plants wrong with those uh biodegradable cups. That's probably partially

15:41.360 --> 15:45.360
it but also the soil has definitely become more depleted. I mean this garden is now seven or eight

15:45.360 --> 15:50.160
years old so I think it might be time if I'm gonna stay here for at least two more years which is

15:50.160 --> 15:55.600
very unlikely but if I do next year I'm going to solarize the garden instead and that'll be a whole

15:55.600 --> 15:59.040
process. It's something that you should do due to your garden every once in a while especially if

15:59.040 --> 16:04.240
you're taking a year off so I don't know if there is a garden video next year it'll just be me

16:04.240 --> 16:09.600
solarizing it but I might actually be moving so maybe it's all a moot point. Anyway that's it for

16:09.600 --> 16:15.360
uh this year's garden escapades. Oh well didn't get as much as previous years but as our good

16:15.360 --> 16:18.000
friend Sonic the Hedgehog says Dave you live and learn.

16:34.240 --> 16:38.000
do

16:45.120 --> 16:45.620
