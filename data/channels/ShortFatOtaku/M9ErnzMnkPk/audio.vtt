00:00.000 --> 00:03.300
I hope you're all having a very Merry Christmas.

00:03.300 --> 00:05.060
This year, let's do something special.

00:05.060 --> 00:08.060
Let's see what the Guardian has in store for Christmas.

00:08.060 --> 00:12.340
I have a collection here of the crankiest Christmas-related Guardian articles I could

00:12.340 --> 00:13.340
find.

00:13.340 --> 00:17.360
This one is from this year, How to Survive Christmas One Step at a Time.

00:17.360 --> 00:22.360
This kind of feels like that Anita Sarkeesian video about Thanksgiving, you know, surviving

00:22.360 --> 00:24.780
the Thanksgiving with your shitty relatives.

00:24.780 --> 00:26.620
I think this might be the same kind of thing.

00:26.620 --> 00:31.340
It's useful to have a scapegoat at Christmas, so mine is the Industrial Revolution.

00:31.340 --> 00:34.060
I... okay.

00:34.060 --> 00:41.500
Yes, the Victorians are responsible for the festive fever dream of Dickensian jollity

00:41.500 --> 00:46.980
we have all internalized, but it's those damn steam and steel barons who allowed us to escape

00:46.980 --> 00:48.900
our families most of the year.

00:48.900 --> 00:54.700
Yeah, capitalism, even in its worst form, did in fact produce some good things.

00:54.700 --> 00:58.400
Since we stopped spending our lives confined to one room with several generations of people

00:58.400 --> 01:03.020
seemingly put on Earth for the sole purpose of annoying us, we've lost the knack of just

01:03.020 --> 01:05.620
tolerating our nearest and dearest, I think.

01:05.620 --> 01:09.980
As a result, when Christmas rolls around, our lack of practice, deluded belief that

01:09.980 --> 01:14.180
this is the time to forge heartwarming memories, and the hysterical exhortations of Yuletide

01:14.180 --> 01:17.580
end-stage capitalism combine to ensure carnage.

01:17.580 --> 01:23.820
I understand that sometimes you may have really terrible relatives, and seeing them can actually

01:23.820 --> 01:24.820
be an ordeal.

01:24.820 --> 01:29.540
However, I have a feeling that most of the young urban socialites nowadays just view

01:29.540 --> 01:34.800
their entire family with disgust for little to no reason.

01:34.800 --> 01:38.940
This article talks about a five-point plan on making it to New Year's.

01:38.940 --> 01:40.420
Okay, let's see what they've got here.

01:40.420 --> 01:45.920
I'll be applying a step-by-step approach to engineering peace on Earth and goodwill to

01:45.920 --> 01:47.420
your UKIP uncle?

01:47.420 --> 01:51.100
Does... does everyone in Britain have a UKIP uncle?

01:51.100 --> 01:52.660
Are they that popular now?

01:52.700 --> 01:57.660
I do like how we've gone from racist uncle to UKIP uncle, though it's quite the stretch.

01:57.660 --> 02:02.880
The night before Christmas, the vision, the soaring voices of boy trebles and dancing

02:02.880 --> 02:06.380
candlelight illuminating the darkness, a time of magic.

02:06.380 --> 02:12.380
The reality, the last grainy chocolate-flavored blob has been retched from its cardboard sarcophagus,

02:12.380 --> 02:14.980
but no one is tucked up dreaming of sugar plums.

02:14.980 --> 02:16.740
What the hell is a sugar plum, anyway?

02:16.740 --> 02:22.220
They've probably been reimagined as gilded edible mini-drones for $31.99.

02:22.220 --> 02:29.940
See, I have a feeling that this article is mostly in jest, like, they're kind of overblowing

02:29.940 --> 02:33.900
the Christmas season to make it seem better or worse than it actually is.

02:33.900 --> 02:39.580
You know, in a national lampoon kind of way, where that movie was all about simultaneously

02:39.580 --> 02:43.260
showing the best and worst parts of Christmas with your family?

02:43.260 --> 02:50.460
Christmas morning, the vision, an explosion of joy, the reality, an explosion of plastic,

02:50.460 --> 02:56.100
actual children and emotion, if stocking chocolate is not swiftly removed.

02:56.100 --> 03:00.860
Family fight flashpoint, ingratitude timing squabbles, my husband blithely loading a plate

03:00.860 --> 03:03.800
with the expense of Christmas salmon I was saving for lunch.

03:03.800 --> 03:07.140
And this is what I mean about this article being half serious, half satire, because it's

03:07.140 --> 03:11.500
filled with the vision, the reality, and the point at which the family starts fighting.

03:11.500 --> 03:16.100
And you know what, this article I think is ultimately not so bad, but I do know that

03:16.100 --> 03:21.720
we're only scratching the surface regarding how ridiculous The Guardian gets when it comes

03:21.720 --> 03:23.620
to the Christmas season.

03:23.620 --> 03:27.460
Of course, this person still ultimately likes to shove in their own brand of socialism by

03:27.460 --> 03:28.460
the end of the article.

03:28.460 --> 03:32.380
The family are your weirdos, cherish them and add this moment to your mental album of

03:32.380 --> 03:34.780
festive lies, sorry, memories.

03:34.780 --> 03:38.700
And remember, thanks to the Industrial Revolution, it will all be over soon.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.860
Maybe for you, but not for the rest of us.

03:40.860 --> 03:44.820
However, let's visit the ghost of Guardian past and take a look at some of their older

03:44.820 --> 03:45.980
Christmas articles.

03:45.980 --> 03:52.140
Why I've gone cold turkey on Christmas consumerism While everybody else endures the stress and

03:52.140 --> 03:55.700
expense of preparing for the festivities, I'm sitting back and taking it easy.

03:55.700 --> 04:00.460
This year, my considerably less wholesome family of two not-so-little women and one

04:00.460 --> 04:03.860
baby boy will be having Christmas without any presents.

04:03.860 --> 04:05.420
Okay, hardly any presents.

04:05.420 --> 04:09.500
There will be a giant river penguin for the baby, a bottle of wine and a roast chicken

04:09.500 --> 04:13.080
for my partner and me, and a rawhide cigar for the dog.

04:13.080 --> 04:16.800
There will be a tree and it will have decorations, old ones, there will be good and bad films,

04:16.800 --> 04:17.800
old ones.

04:17.800 --> 04:18.800
Here's a picture around our hearth.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.800
Where's the picture?

04:19.800 --> 04:20.800
Is it this?

04:20.800 --> 04:21.800
That's just a sprout.

04:21.800 --> 04:30.380
There's no picture, did the picture disappear, did they just cut the picture out?

04:30.380 --> 04:33.360
Is the Guardian running out of money so much that they're actually axing pictures out of

04:33.360 --> 04:34.360
old articles?

04:34.360 --> 04:38.400
But, nonetheless, there's no moral imperative to have a giant Christmas or to see every

04:38.400 --> 04:40.660
single family member all the time.

04:40.660 --> 04:44.260
You may remember it being that way when you were a kid, but I'm sure there were some Christmases

04:44.260 --> 04:48.540
where it just didn't happen and your youngest memories start to blend together.

04:48.540 --> 04:52.040
For example, this year, my girlfriend and I went back to my hometown for a couple days

04:52.040 --> 04:54.860
and saw my parents, but only at the start of December.

04:54.860 --> 04:59.340
We were there for like, I think it was December 2nd and December 3rd or something like that.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.300
And this year, we're just hanging around the house.

05:01.300 --> 05:04.700
We're not really doing anything, we're probably going to be streaming later.

05:04.700 --> 05:08.500
I'm making homemade pizzas because I'm actually a pretty good cook in my opinion, but we're

05:08.500 --> 05:10.260
not doing a traditional Christmas.

05:10.260 --> 05:14.840
I do definitely understand the feeling that Christmas can be stressful, but I don't think

05:14.840 --> 05:21.340
that it's just this end of time scenario that a lot of people, especially youngins on the

05:21.340 --> 05:23.220
left like to consider it to be.

05:23.220 --> 05:28.440
My son is now 15 months old, which means that although this isn't his first Christmas, it's

05:28.440 --> 05:33.460
his first not spent breastfeeding his way through presents, lunch and my fair lady.

05:33.460 --> 05:37.300
Permission to take yourself off to a corner, Nigel Farage, and cower beneath a makeshift

05:37.300 --> 05:38.840
tent.

05:38.840 --> 05:43.920
What is it with The Guardian and just shitting on UKIP every single article?

05:43.920 --> 05:46.520
Are they honestly that afraid of the party?

05:46.520 --> 05:50.520
Apparently this person's going cold turkey on Christmas consuming, or as she likes to

05:50.520 --> 05:53.040
think of it, replacing shopping with living.

05:53.040 --> 05:57.180
So on Black Friday, I borrowed three books for the baby from our local library.

05:57.180 --> 06:00.800
On Cyber Monday, I spent nothing but some energy on feeling smug.

06:00.800 --> 06:06.560
It's all taking me back to that vintage Christmas of 1988 where I took a book off my mom's shelf,

06:06.560 --> 06:09.360
wrapped it and gave it right back to her.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.940
She never realized and I never stopped congratulating myself.

06:11.940 --> 06:13.680
It was the best of times.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.600
Again I have to kind of agree with this article.

06:15.600 --> 06:21.320
There is definitely some value in not spending thousands of fucking dollars on gifts.

06:21.320 --> 06:24.640
But here's where the hatred of the holiday comes in.

06:24.640 --> 06:28.720
In any case, Christmas is supposed to be cheap and nasty.

06:28.720 --> 06:34.440
No matter how we try to rehash it, like that joyless stack of anally folded or rather pre-loved

06:34.440 --> 06:38.720
wrapping paper that should have been loved just once and then ripped to shreds, Christmas

06:38.720 --> 06:40.320
will never be cool.

06:40.320 --> 06:45.420
This is why we love it and why, in these secular, straightened times, we stubbornly keep going

06:45.420 --> 06:49.680
at it with tinsel on our heads and a song murdered by the X Factor in our hearts.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.420
Doing Christmas on a shoestring budget isn't a lifestyle choice.

06:52.420 --> 06:56.660
It's not about saving with Jamie by buying an enormous side of salmon and eating it for

06:56.660 --> 07:01.420
a fortnight in 20 different ways until salmon and Christmas and leftovers are ruined forever.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.540
Is salmon for Christmas a big thing in Britain?

07:03.540 --> 07:04.740
Because it's not over here.

07:04.740 --> 07:09.340
I mean, I've had salmon at Christmas before, but it's not considered a traditional dish

07:09.340 --> 07:10.340
at all.

07:10.340 --> 07:11.340
Over here it's definitely turkey.

07:11.340 --> 07:16.320
Anyway, fine, this person thinks that Christmas is too consumeristic and doesn't want to participate.

07:16.320 --> 07:19.720
But I think in missing it she misses part of the point.

07:19.720 --> 07:22.320
But of course she obviously gets another part of the point.

07:22.320 --> 07:23.320
So whatever.

07:23.320 --> 07:26.020
Christmas Day is supposed to be dull.

07:26.020 --> 07:28.460
Enjoy the novelty of utter boredom.

07:28.460 --> 07:31.020
Let's see what this one's all about.

07:31.020 --> 07:32.420
Don't catch up on the cereal.

07:32.420 --> 07:37.040
Do as God intended and watch a war documentary with your extended family as time slows to

07:37.040 --> 07:38.040
a crawl.

07:38.040 --> 07:44.540
I can only wonder what kind of hellish family life you must have endured when you were a

07:44.540 --> 07:45.540
kid.

07:45.540 --> 07:47.960
I mean, my mom loves watching certain movies around Christmas every year.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.700
She always watches The Sound of Music.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.380
We always watch National Lampoon.

07:51.380 --> 07:54.180
Charlie Brown usually comes on the TV once in a while.

07:54.180 --> 07:58.200
There's a staple of movies and shows that just seem to be part of Christmas now, and

07:58.200 --> 07:59.200
that's fine.

07:59.200 --> 08:06.000
However, more recently I've noticed that on TV, on the week up to Christmas, certain

08:06.000 --> 08:11.620
television stations will start playing on repeat like the entire Harry Potter series.

08:11.620 --> 08:14.040
Or they'll play the Back to the Future trilogy.

08:14.040 --> 08:18.480
You know, they'll just pull out these whimsical adventure stories that don't really have anything

08:18.480 --> 08:22.080
to do with Christmas at all, and they'll just play them.

08:22.080 --> 08:28.080
And for the past ten years or so, if I'm ever at my parents' place for Christmas, which

08:28.080 --> 08:33.640
isn't much anymore, but does happen sometimes, one of those movies will be playing on TV

08:33.640 --> 08:37.500
in the background while we're opening Christmas gifts on Christmas morning.

08:37.500 --> 08:43.460
If you have a family situation where time slows to a crawl, you may need to recognize

08:43.460 --> 08:46.920
that that may be unique to you.

08:46.920 --> 08:47.920
Maybe not completely unique.

08:47.920 --> 08:51.440
Like I said, there's always some bad families out there, and there's always going to be

08:51.440 --> 08:52.760
some people you want to avoid.

08:52.760 --> 08:57.320
But to straight up say that because you have regular negative experiences that Christmas

08:57.560 --> 09:03.360
day is supposed to be dull, I think the problem might be with you.

09:03.360 --> 09:06.780
How to keep your Christmas spirit when all about you are losing theirs.

09:06.780 --> 09:10.360
It's an annual conundrum, particularly as you get older and less inclined to make any

09:10.360 --> 09:11.860
effort whatsoever.

09:11.860 --> 09:16.800
The war on Christmas, as anyone not watching the Nativity Facts, Fictions, and Faith on

09:16.800 --> 09:21.800
Fox News at this very moment is well aware, isn't prosecuted by a loose collective of

09:21.800 --> 09:25.600
socialists, atheists, and alternative religions.

09:25.600 --> 09:28.920
Also you didn't say loose, you said lose.

09:28.920 --> 09:34.200
And yes, I would consider these groups, with the exception of the atheists, sometimes to

09:34.200 --> 09:35.800
be fucking losers.

09:35.800 --> 09:41.240
No, the real war is being fought by the forces of Christmas capitalism, those which burn

09:41.240 --> 09:45.320
joy out of the season with the intensity of a Star Wars lightsaber, 25% off till New Year's

09:45.320 --> 09:46.320
Day.

09:46.320 --> 09:50.320
Okay, I think there's going to be a common thread throughout all these articles, and

09:50.320 --> 09:56.240
it's going to be the fact that you gotta pay for shit during Christmas and people don't

09:56.240 --> 10:00.840
like that, because if you write for the Guardian, you're probably a fucking socialist.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.520
The entire point of Christmas is that it's supposed to be boring.

10:03.520 --> 10:07.440
You get an hour of excitement first thing and then the day devolves into an endless

10:07.440 --> 10:12.440
cycle of cooking, small talk, snoring relatives, overheated rooms with no escape, and in England

10:12.440 --> 10:14.320
at least, the Queen's Speech.

10:14.320 --> 10:19.240
Then comes the slow, dull glide into evening, with its massive sense of anti-climax.

10:19.240 --> 10:24.040
Like the worst Sunday night before school feeling, tinged with senses of loss, aging,

10:24.040 --> 10:27.220
and the terrible, terrible transience of it all.

10:27.220 --> 10:31.560
This is somebody who has not come to grips with their own mortality.

10:31.560 --> 10:36.080
And I know it's strange to bring that up in a video about fucking Christmas, but I honestly

10:36.080 --> 10:37.440
think it's the case.

10:37.440 --> 10:42.080
This is somebody who is saying, when I was a kid, it was so fun, I was getting gifts

10:42.080 --> 10:46.600
from my parents, there were new games and toys and everything was magical, it was great.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.520
Look at her up here.

10:48.520 --> 10:52.720
The most exciting element of Christmas used to be the snow beneath the tree, made of packing

10:52.720 --> 10:56.600
material, which I remember thrillingly retained one's teeth marks when you bit in.

10:56.600 --> 11:01.200
She's complaining now that, at least in some ways, Christmas is a holiday for children

11:01.200 --> 11:03.320
and she's no longer a child.

11:03.320 --> 11:07.700
And she has not been able to find a Christmas for adults that she can enjoy.

11:07.700 --> 11:11.480
So she's just sitting around, being bored.

11:11.480 --> 11:14.020
And complaining about the fact that she's getting old.

11:14.020 --> 11:17.560
Continuing down the socialist rabbit hole, the real war on Christmas is our corporate

11:17.560 --> 11:19.800
driven material culture.

11:19.800 --> 11:24.680
Corporate Christmas is not a time of humble reflection, charity and modesty, it is a market

11:24.680 --> 11:26.660
opportunity to be exploited.

11:26.660 --> 11:31.320
Forget goodwill towards men, forget Charlie Brown, instead the commando wing of Disney's

11:31.320 --> 11:36.280
media army has produced a climate warming suburban energy vampire version of dueling

11:36.280 --> 11:37.280
banjos.

11:37.280 --> 11:41.780
No, there's no room at the inn for something as outdated as goodwill when families go head

11:41.780 --> 11:47.300
to head matching wits and carbon footprints in a contrived reality showdown, and the winner

11:47.300 --> 11:48.520
gets money.

11:48.520 --> 11:51.380
Each episode ends with $50,000 awarded to the victorious family.

11:51.380 --> 11:55.520
What they're talking about is a show called The Great Christmas Light Fight, which is

11:55.520 --> 12:01.440
just basically an attempt to make the most overblown Christmas light setup I have ever

12:01.440 --> 12:02.620
seen in my life.

12:02.620 --> 12:05.500
This is in fact worse than National Lampoon's lights.

12:05.500 --> 12:09.500
The only thing that matches ABC's too close to the bone expression of a corporately sponsored

12:09.500 --> 12:14.560
Christmas is America's annual Black Friday devilish and derby, and the desperate consumerism

12:14.560 --> 12:15.980
that fuels it.

12:15.980 --> 12:20.940
All videos of the violent scrum have become a tradition too, with each passing year the

12:20.940 --> 12:24.260
kickoff to the profitable holiday season looks more and more like a kickoff to a football

12:24.260 --> 12:28.040
game as retailers keep their stores open and their minds closed to anything other than

12:28.040 --> 12:30.660
squeezing a little more profit out of embattled consumers.

12:30.660 --> 12:34.740
I could say that this is a problem with American culture because if there's one thing that

12:34.740 --> 12:40.260
Americans are known for overseas, and even in Canada, which is obviously a foreign nation

12:40.260 --> 12:44.900
member, it's not overseas, it's not even American militarism, though that's pretty

12:44.900 --> 12:48.380
high up there, it's American overconsumption.

12:48.380 --> 12:52.620
So there's definitely a statement to be made about American overconsumption.

12:52.620 --> 12:56.540
If you look at Suda51's games, like Killer7 or No More Heroes or whatever, those games

12:56.540 --> 13:01.580
are basically all about American overconsumption, that would be the thematic element of those

13:01.580 --> 13:02.580
games.

13:02.580 --> 13:07.500
So there's definitely this idea overseas that American culture is basically the stereotypical

13:07.500 --> 13:11.140
fat guy in a hover around eating McDonalds.

13:11.140 --> 13:15.620
But there's something else to talk about here that's not just overconsumption, it's competition.

13:15.620 --> 13:21.180
You look at the great Christmas light fight, it's not just the fact that they're creating

13:21.180 --> 13:23.940
these monstrosities, it's the fact that they're competing.

13:23.940 --> 13:28.300
And you look at stores in Black Friday, yes there are crowds who are clamoring to get

13:28.300 --> 13:31.100
a hold of something, but they describe it as a kickoff.

13:31.100 --> 13:34.140
And if you read the rest of the article and you kind of look at some of the language they

13:34.140 --> 13:40.460
use, like they talk about the Alamo, they talk about Christmas soldiers and etc.

13:40.460 --> 13:45.340
It really does seem that a lot of the problem that this person has with it is that, not

13:45.340 --> 13:49.680
that it's over-consumeristic, although it is, it's that it's competitive.

13:49.680 --> 13:57.040
And I'm not surprised at all that a socialist would be anti-competitive, because competition

13:57.040 --> 13:58.760
is inherently capitalist.

13:58.760 --> 14:05.640
The fact that maybe there are a group of people, all with varying levels of skill and experience,

14:05.640 --> 14:09.680
competing to try and come out on top, and that there are winners and losers, and that

14:09.680 --> 14:14.920
the spoils of the competition go disproportionately to the winners because they have won.

14:14.920 --> 14:18.480
I can see exactly why a socialist would find that offensive.

14:18.480 --> 14:23.880
So variety at Christmas is a challenge, but it's better than the alternative.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.540
I'm somebody who doesn't drink, ever.

14:25.540 --> 14:30.260
I haven't had a drop of alcohol in about five years.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.780
I haven't been drunk in about ten.

14:32.780 --> 14:37.800
And I'm not about to start now, I have no desire to drink at all.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.500
So maybe I'm not going to be able to understand this article as well as the previous ones.

14:40.500 --> 14:44.020
I could kind of read into the subtext of the previous ones, maybe not so much this one.

14:44.020 --> 14:48.260
I remember clearly, indeed it's one of the few things I do remember, this counselor turning

14:48.260 --> 14:50.540
to me and asking if I had drunk enough.

14:50.540 --> 14:54.960
I must have been in my mid-twenties at the time and I couldn't quite grasp what he meant.

14:54.960 --> 14:58.640
At best I found his tone flippant, antagonistic even.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.740
It would be another fifteen years before I fully understood what a pertinent question

15:01.740 --> 15:02.740
he'd raised.

15:02.740 --> 15:07.680
This is something I've noticed, I've known a few alcoholics in my life, and if you ever

15:07.680 --> 15:13.960
ask them, you know, have you drunk enough, they will get extremely defensive.

15:13.960 --> 15:18.140
If you're talking to a non-alcoholic who's drinking and you ask them have you had enough,

15:18.140 --> 15:20.560
they'll say yes or they'll say no, depending on what the answer is.

15:20.560 --> 15:25.200
But if you ask an alcoholic that question, they take it as a personal slight.

15:25.200 --> 15:28.680
And so it's Christmas again, and do you know something, this would be my third Christmas

15:28.680 --> 15:29.680
sober.

15:29.680 --> 15:33.880
And when I say sober, I mean sober, not a dry drunk, my tongue hanging out and desperate.

15:33.880 --> 15:36.760
In other words, I did eventually drink enough.

15:36.760 --> 15:40.520
And I was sitting here quietly the other night when a wave of joy washed over me.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.440
I don't crave alcohol.

15:42.440 --> 15:46.360
Not that this was an epiphany, but at this time of year, what a powerful reminder of

15:46.360 --> 15:48.000
just how lucky I am.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.720
I'm going to assume that this is written by an alcoholic who has given up drinking and

15:52.720 --> 15:57.680
now he has progressed to the point where he no longer feels the urge to drink anymore.

15:57.680 --> 16:01.600
And if that's the case, you know, congratulations, it's tough to get out of, man.

16:01.600 --> 16:02.600
You know what?

16:02.600 --> 16:06.240
I completely understand my relatively unique point of view on this topic, but this is actually

16:06.240 --> 16:08.400
a very reasonable article.

16:08.400 --> 16:13.600
It's just basically about a former alcoholic, and I'm genuinely proud of what this person's

16:13.600 --> 16:14.600
accomplished.

16:14.600 --> 16:19.400
However, in Guardian fashion, they did write the headline as if it's another one of those

16:19.400 --> 16:21.460
I hate my family articles.

16:21.460 --> 16:25.380
And speaking of hating your family, Christmas is ruined by children.

16:25.380 --> 16:35.120
Our overindulgent society has turned children into greedy little emperors.

16:35.120 --> 16:38.440
Thanks Santa, I can look forward to a Christmas with adults.

16:38.440 --> 16:40.140
Children ruin Christmas.

16:40.140 --> 16:42.260
I know this because I've done it myself.

16:42.260 --> 16:47.020
As a small boy growing up in the early 1970s, I had my heart set on an astronaut outfit.

16:47.020 --> 16:50.300
Turns out my mother had left it too late and all she could find in the toy shop, space

16:50.300 --> 16:51.940
man wise, was the helmet.

16:51.940 --> 16:57.380
The fury of a disappointed, petulant child knows no bounds and I screamed, then cried,

16:57.380 --> 17:01.660
then threw the helmet across the room and made my family's Christmas utterly miserable.

17:01.660 --> 17:04.380
My parents were on eggshells for the rest of the day.

17:04.380 --> 17:07.420
My sisters opened their presents in embarrassed silence.

17:07.420 --> 17:08.860
Even the dog looked depressed.

17:08.860 --> 17:11.900
It sounds like you might have been a terrible child.

17:11.900 --> 17:15.620
Alternatively, it also sounds like you could have just had one of those days that children

17:15.620 --> 17:16.620
have.

17:16.620 --> 17:20.740
It doesn't excuse it, but every kid has a day where they act like little shit.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.900
It doesn't make them a bad person.

17:22.900 --> 17:26.980
I can remember days when I acted like that, and as an adult, thinking back, I am embarrassed

17:26.980 --> 17:32.820
of them now, but it is something that every kid goes through and it's the parents responsibility

17:32.820 --> 17:35.360
to teach them why they can't do that.

17:35.360 --> 17:40.160
The traditional, and let's face it, slightly sickening Christmas image of the whole family

17:40.160 --> 17:45.040
joyously opening presents around a real tree, grateful for the gifts they receive, is woefully

17:45.040 --> 17:48.040
outdated if it ever existed in the first place.

17:48.040 --> 17:51.500
The reality of the modern Christmas nightmare is more like this.

17:51.500 --> 17:55.720
You bought the wrong Xbox game for your 10 year old son, and the trainers you bought

17:55.720 --> 17:58.200
for your daughter, the apple of your eye.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.820
Why isn't your son the apple of your eye?

18:00.820 --> 18:01.820
Why not both of them?

18:01.820 --> 18:04.200
Are you actually playing favorites here?

18:04.200 --> 18:06.240
Were fashionable last year.

18:06.240 --> 18:09.860
That's why they were so heavily discounted, but you do like a bargain.

18:09.860 --> 18:13.460
As for the mobile phones you thoughtfully got for them despite their tender years because

18:13.460 --> 18:17.140
everyone else in their class has one, don't even go there.

18:17.140 --> 18:21.080
Your delightful progeny are now weeping with rage at your ineptitude and hate you for ruining

18:21.080 --> 18:22.260
their day.

18:22.260 --> 18:24.140
You don't know anything about anything.

18:24.140 --> 18:26.700
You are an idiot.

18:26.700 --> 18:31.700
If this is happening every single Christmas, not just once in a while because, you know,

18:31.700 --> 18:36.500
kids sometimes throw tantrums for bad reasons, even the best ones, or there might even be

18:36.500 --> 18:44.500
a problem with your kid mentally or psychologically, but if not any of those reasons, if this happens

18:44.500 --> 18:49.140
every single Christmas, that means you probably suck at disciplining your children.

18:49.140 --> 18:52.020
On the one hand, I hate the mentality that you should always be thankful for the things

18:52.020 --> 18:55.860
that you're given because if someone just hands you a pile of garbage, you're not going

18:55.860 --> 18:57.340
to say thank you for this garbage.

18:57.340 --> 19:01.700
However, on the other hand, if someone has made a good faith attempt at trying to brighten

19:01.700 --> 19:06.580
your day and then they fail at it, you should still be thankful for the attempt and it's

19:06.580 --> 19:08.660
important to teach your kids that too.

19:08.660 --> 19:11.520
If you haven't taught them that, you've failed as a parent.

19:11.520 --> 19:16.220
The idea that parents these days are time poor and overcompensate for this by indulging

19:16.220 --> 19:20.540
their offspring is so familiar as to have become a cliche, but it's true.

19:20.540 --> 19:25.060
We seem to be hell bent on creating our own versions of China's little emperors and all

19:25.060 --> 19:28.740
this over pampering and overindulgence means that children aren't able to cope with not

19:28.740 --> 19:29.740
getting what they want.

19:29.740 --> 19:30.940
Yeah, that's true, isn't it?

19:30.940 --> 19:32.560
Maybe you should have done something about that.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.860
Maybe you should have adjusted how you raised your children.

19:34.860 --> 19:38.800
Maybe you should have done it before they all moved off to university and started shitting

19:38.800 --> 19:41.900
up the rest of society with their snowflake bullshit.

19:41.900 --> 19:44.980
Why I'm opting out of Christmas.

19:44.980 --> 19:47.420
Is it because you're a cat lady?

19:47.420 --> 19:51.040
We have ruined Christmas by allowing capitalism to tell us we should be buying ourselves into

19:51.040 --> 19:53.300
an orgy of goodwill and glamour.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.900
An orgy of goodwill!

19:54.900 --> 20:01.280
There's few things in the world that sound better than, say, an orgy of goodwill.

20:01.280 --> 20:06.660
Being under house arrest with a group of disharmonious, sherry-heavy relatives slow-roasting in front

20:06.660 --> 20:10.300
of a flickering television with nothing to look forward to but a ten-minute montage of

20:10.300 --> 20:12.140
royalist propaganda isn't great.

20:12.140 --> 20:16.520
I once spent Christmas morning hiding in a coal shed with a bottle of Morrison's Cava

20:16.520 --> 20:20.380
and a packet of my grandmother's cigarettes, planning how to make my escape to freedom.

20:20.380 --> 20:23.660
Aged 14, I was left to cook dinner while my mother locked herself in the bathroom and

20:23.660 --> 20:25.380
a giant dog defecated on the lawn.

20:25.380 --> 20:30.100
Yeah, see, sometimes you have shitty families.

20:30.100 --> 20:33.100
Sometimes you are the shitty person in the family.

20:33.100 --> 20:34.180
Sometimes it's both.

20:34.180 --> 20:35.180
Maybe here it's both.

20:35.180 --> 20:39.280
Christmas is the stick with which millions of us beat ourselves into brandy-soaked agony

20:39.280 --> 20:44.320
for being poor, single, childless, lonely, or simply bad at being jolly.

20:44.320 --> 20:47.820
You don't have to have all of those markers to have a good life.

20:47.820 --> 20:49.380
You probably need some of them.

20:49.380 --> 20:53.100
You know, there are certainly some universals that humans need, you know?

20:53.540 --> 20:54.540
You need a way to provide for yourself.

20:54.540 --> 20:57.620
You need something useful to spend your time on outside of work.

20:57.620 --> 20:58.620
You need a relationship.

20:58.620 --> 20:59.620
You need a family.

20:59.620 --> 21:00.620
You need kids.

21:00.620 --> 21:02.660
You don't need all of these things, but you need some of them.

21:02.660 --> 21:06.620
If you don't have at least some of them, you're probably going to have a terrible life.

21:06.620 --> 21:11.460
And the problem isn't just to scream at society or scream at Christmas every time it comes

21:11.460 --> 21:12.460
around.

21:12.460 --> 21:15.200
Maybe you should examine your life and figure out why you hate it when other people have

21:15.200 --> 21:16.200
so much fun.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.180
But here's the person's solution.

21:18.180 --> 21:19.380
Stop giving presents.

21:19.380 --> 21:20.860
Stop watching television.

21:20.860 --> 21:22.820
Stop comparing yourself to advertisements.

21:22.820 --> 21:24.680
And actually spend it with people you like.

21:24.680 --> 21:27.180
This year, however, I am opting out altogether.

21:27.180 --> 21:29.060
I shan't be driving home for Christmas.

21:29.060 --> 21:33.580
I have no tree, have wrapped no presents, will eat no turkey, and mull no wine.

21:33.580 --> 21:37.880
Instead, I shall go for a run, listen to the headlines, eat a baked potato, and watch a

21:37.880 --> 21:39.380
Western with my mother.

21:39.380 --> 21:43.300
On Christmas Eve, I plan to volunteer at the Hackney Care Leavers Christmas dinner, but

21:43.300 --> 21:45.980
the day itself is as blank as a fresh fall of snow.

21:45.980 --> 21:46.980
I can't wait.

21:46.980 --> 21:47.980
And that's fine.

21:47.980 --> 21:50.780
You can spend Christmas or any other day however you like.

21:50.780 --> 21:53.380
But it doesn't need to be a fucking Guardian article.

21:53.380 --> 21:56.980
You don't need to tell everybody how you've discovered the true way to spend Christmas

21:56.980 --> 21:59.780
happy, not doing Christmas at all.

21:59.780 --> 22:04.380
Maybe you should just do the things that you like to do and allow other people to do the

22:04.380 --> 22:06.620
things that they like to do unmolested.

22:06.620 --> 22:11.420
And if you find yourself either not having fun doing the things that you thought you

22:11.420 --> 22:14.860
liked, or alternatively looking at people who are doing something more traditional and

22:14.860 --> 22:19.460
having an irrational rage towards them, then maybe you need to examine your own life.

22:19.460 --> 22:23.260
Warning, your festive meal could be more damaging than a long-haul flight.

22:23.260 --> 22:25.500
This is going to be like a vegan article, isn't it?

22:25.500 --> 22:29.520
Eating certain meats is about the worst thing you can do to the planet, yeah, yeah, vegan.

22:29.520 --> 22:34.100
A kilogram of beef protein reared on a British Hill farm can generate the equivalent of 643

22:34.100 --> 22:35.380
kilograms of carbon dioxide.

22:35.380 --> 22:40.460
A kilogram of lamb protein produced in the same place can generate 749 kilograms.

22:40.460 --> 22:45.460
One kilo of protein from either source, in other words, causes more greenhouse gas emissions

22:45.460 --> 22:47.800
than a passenger flying from London to New York.

22:47.800 --> 22:52.260
The figures are so high because modern animal husbandry is so unproductive.

22:52.260 --> 22:56.260
To produce one lamb, you need to keep a large area of land bare and fertilized.

22:56.260 --> 22:59.880
The animal must roam the hills to find its food, burning more fat and producing more

22:59.880 --> 23:02.440
methane than a stalled beast would.

23:02.440 --> 23:06.400
Environmentalism is probably the only place that I side consistently more with the left

23:06.400 --> 23:13.220
than the right than any other part of politics, just because there's some undeniable truth

23:13.220 --> 23:16.320
regarding humanity's impact on the environment.

23:16.320 --> 23:21.680
The idea that global warming, for example, or climate change is just a Chinese myth,

23:21.680 --> 23:24.760
as Trump described it, is completely stupid.

23:24.760 --> 23:27.680
Very clearly we have an impact on the environment.

23:27.680 --> 23:33.200
Very clearly the things that we do impact the situation that we find ourselves in.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.400
We are not somehow separate from the rest of the world and we're not special in that

23:36.400 --> 23:37.400
regard.

23:37.400 --> 23:43.340
At the same time, this entire article has been about the various costs of raising animals

23:43.340 --> 23:44.340
certain ways.

23:44.340 --> 23:47.060
And it has yet to come into Christmas, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be something

23:47.060 --> 23:51.220
along the lines of, if you eat a big turkey dinner or something, then you are destroying

23:51.220 --> 23:52.220
the planet.

23:52.220 --> 23:55.640
As we approach the end of the ride, there's a few crazy ones right here.

23:55.640 --> 24:00.540
Sweden makes my gender-free toy Christmas wish come true.

24:00.540 --> 24:04.320
With a picture of a girl with a Nerf gun, a Swedish toy retailer is arming children

24:04.320 --> 24:06.640
with the ability to question outdated gender roles.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.000
Well guess what, miss not progressive enough?

24:09.000 --> 24:13.160
Swedish toy retailers are also training women to become active shooters.

24:13.160 --> 24:17.700
All I want for Christmas is an end to the mandatory gendering of every children's toy.

24:17.700 --> 24:20.560
They're not gendered.

24:20.560 --> 24:24.960
There might be a boy or a girl on the box, and I'm sure that's fucking traumatizing for

24:24.960 --> 24:29.560
you, but you know what, if your little girl wants a Nerf gun, buy her the Nerf gun.

24:29.560 --> 24:32.920
If your little boy wants a doll, you can always buy him the doll.

24:32.920 --> 24:35.760
It's kind of like the pink tax bullshit.

24:35.760 --> 24:42.020
If the men and women's products are the same fucking thing, but the women's costs more,

24:42.020 --> 24:43.020
just buy the men's.

24:43.020 --> 24:44.100
What does it matter?

24:44.100 --> 24:48.240
The amazing thing is that gender roles for children have become so calcified that such

24:48.240 --> 24:50.860
petty things can be presented as radical.

24:50.860 --> 24:53.540
Sample headline from the Daily Mail, Dolls?

24:53.540 --> 24:54.840
They're not just for girls.

24:54.840 --> 24:59.340
Which of course relies on the voice of your inner UKIP voter shouting, yes, dolls are

24:59.340 --> 25:00.340
just for girls.

25:00.340 --> 25:05.700
Okay, we should probably have had like a UKIP counter in this video, because how many times

25:05.700 --> 25:07.620
has UKIP been scapegoated so far?

25:07.620 --> 25:08.620
Five times?

25:08.620 --> 25:12.820
A lot of people will try to tell you that boys just don't like playing with dolls.

25:12.820 --> 25:16.840
Coincidentally, these same people also tell any boys in their vicinity that boys don't

25:16.840 --> 25:18.460
play with dolls.

25:18.460 --> 25:22.940
It's not an innate sexual difference that makes girls and boys play either side of the

25:22.940 --> 25:27.900
pink-blue divide, it's adults constantly impressing on their charges that one group of toys is

25:27.900 --> 25:29.940
right and the other is wrong.

25:29.940 --> 25:35.100
I remember having a doll house in fact, and I asked my mom, I was maybe five years old

25:35.100 --> 25:39.060
or something at the time, you know, I was in fact the woke child everyone talks about

25:39.060 --> 25:40.060
on Twitter.

25:40.060 --> 25:45.420
I asked my mom, hey, um, is it all right that I, if I play with a doll house, even though

25:45.420 --> 25:46.420
I'm a boy?

25:46.420 --> 25:49.060
And my mom said, well, it doesn't matter, you know, play with it, play with whatever

25:49.060 --> 25:50.060
you want.

25:50.060 --> 25:51.060
If you're having fun, what does it matter?

25:51.060 --> 25:52.060
And I said, yeah, it didn't matter.

25:52.060 --> 25:53.060
And you know what?

25:53.060 --> 25:58.540
Um, at the time I was seven or eight, I had naturally grown out of playing with dolls

25:58.540 --> 25:59.540
and doll houses.

25:59.540 --> 26:02.780
And if I hadn't grown out of playing with dolls and doll houses, it would have been

26:02.780 --> 26:03.780
fine as well.

26:03.780 --> 26:09.220
And I think there definitely is a biological divide here, at least on some level, you know,

26:09.220 --> 26:13.780
it's no secret that, you know, on average, and we're talking like a very large average

26:13.780 --> 26:16.660
because we're talking about 50% of the entire human population.

26:16.660 --> 26:20.180
So it's not at all going to be consistent all the time.

26:20.180 --> 26:25.300
But on average, boys prefer things and girls prefer people.

26:25.300 --> 26:31.100
So boys generally enjoy, you know, like, uh, children's tool sets or cars or whatever.

26:31.300 --> 26:33.780
And girls generally enjoy dolls and doll houses.

26:33.780 --> 26:40.020
And if you happen to have a boy or a girl that likes both or only likes the other gender's

26:40.020 --> 26:41.300
toys, that's fine too.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.300
It's not a big deal.

26:42.300 --> 26:46.340
I don't think it's something that needs correction through social engineering.

26:46.340 --> 26:50.500
I was determined to give my first child a beginning free from gender dogma.

26:50.500 --> 26:55.460
So it was both brilliant and slightly blindsiding when aged three, his Christmas list led off

26:55.460 --> 26:56.940
with a baby and a buggy.

26:56.940 --> 26:58.740
Okay, well, I mean, good for him.

26:58.740 --> 27:02.620
He wanted a toy baby and he wanted a toy buggy to push him around in.

27:02.620 --> 27:03.620
That's fine.

27:03.620 --> 27:06.380
But the pink pox couldn't be kept out forever.

27:06.380 --> 27:10.780
It seemed to arrive in the space of a single week, a preschool room full of stripey t-shirts

27:10.780 --> 27:14.300
and denim half erupting in tiaras and princess dresses.

27:14.300 --> 27:18.300
Us parents had enjoyed a good run, but our children had finally twigged that greater

27:18.300 --> 27:21.820
forces wanted them to conform to a certain pair of types.

27:21.820 --> 27:24.900
At first, my reaction to this was one of cynical resignation.

27:24.900 --> 27:28.500
Of course, we couldn't win against the masked forces of Disney and Mattel.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.060
Why had we even tried?

27:30.060 --> 27:31.860
Maybe it wasn't Disney and Mattel.

27:31.860 --> 27:37.340
Maybe it was because as children go from three to five and then from five to eight and then

27:37.340 --> 27:44.380
from eight to the teenage years, certain forces as they grow up, including but not limited

27:44.380 --> 27:49.420
to puberty, start to make boys and girls act a little bit different from each other.

27:49.420 --> 27:54.000
And moreover, if they're enjoying themselves, if once they've kind of gone through their

27:54.000 --> 27:58.800
split and now they're happy being whatever gender they are, if they're happy, what does

27:58.800 --> 27:59.800
it matter?

27:59.800 --> 28:05.320
The Christmas shutdown just makes us drunker, fatter, lazier, and lonelier.

28:05.320 --> 28:12.080
Buddy, this picture shows you to probably be drunker, fatter, lazier, and lonelier,

28:12.080 --> 28:13.880
and you're looking for something to blame it on?

28:13.880 --> 28:18.880
I guess there was a rail shutdown in 2014 in the UK.

28:18.880 --> 28:21.660
During Christmas, no public transport moves.

28:21.660 --> 28:27.620
To get from A to Z without a private car and overpriced taxi is impossible.

28:27.620 --> 28:33.240
This is your complaint, that the buses don't run on Christmas Day.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.240
Is that it?

28:34.240 --> 28:39.180
When aircraft touch down at, say, Heathrow, their passengers find themselves marooned.

28:39.180 --> 28:44.340
The country beyond the airport is impenetrable unless they can afford its inflated cab fares.

28:44.340 --> 28:50.300
It lies there, hushed and immobile, smelling faintly of roasts, quite unlike anywhere else.

28:50.300 --> 28:52.380
This is really where you're going with this, isn't it?

28:52.380 --> 28:54.500
You can't catch the bus.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.860
You can't catch the bus on the 25th.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.660
So it's a big fucking problem.

28:58.660 --> 29:01.540
This article is mainly just a big fat complaint.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.380
It's not really worth going into.

29:03.380 --> 29:09.140
But why does the end of it have something about Nigel Farage's coat?

29:09.140 --> 29:10.500
It's not like it's a new article.

29:10.500 --> 29:15.100
It still has the end of, it just has an excerpt.

29:15.100 --> 29:18.820
Even reading it, it's an excerpt from a different article.

29:18.820 --> 29:19.820
Did something fuck up?

29:20.340 --> 29:24.820
Sometimes on some websites, if you scroll down long enough, the article changes, right?

29:24.820 --> 29:26.980
You'll even see the URL change.

29:26.980 --> 29:29.660
But this time, it doesn't happen at all.

29:29.660 --> 29:34.460
They just tacked on the end of a different article into this one.

29:34.460 --> 29:35.940
Here's another angry soy boy.

29:35.940 --> 29:39.120
It's time for a real war on Christmas.

29:39.120 --> 29:43.260
This is definitely not the most wonderful time of the year.

29:43.260 --> 29:47.780
I'm not surprised that even in 2014, you were a fucking NPC, buddy.

29:47.780 --> 29:49.180
Let's cancel Christmas.

29:49.180 --> 29:50.180
No.

29:50.180 --> 29:53.260
I understand that this is last minute, and some of you may have already started ordering

29:53.260 --> 29:56.940
presents for family and loved ones on Amazon, bought airplane tickets, or planned a menu

29:56.940 --> 29:57.940
for the big family meal.

29:57.940 --> 29:58.940
But hear me out.

29:58.940 --> 30:03.020
I think we will be better off, all of us as individuals, everyone together, society, the

30:03.020 --> 30:06.200
world, if we stop celebrating this holiday.

30:06.200 --> 30:09.740
In truth, I think we'd be better off if we stopped celebrating all holidays.

30:09.740 --> 30:11.380
Holidays are stupid.

30:11.380 --> 30:12.920
Everything must be equalized.

30:12.920 --> 30:14.180
Everything must be the same.

30:14.180 --> 30:21.500
The entire world must be a globe of tasteless, valueless, grey paste.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.380
Differences are oppressive.

30:23.380 --> 30:25.580
Value hierarchies do not exist.

30:25.580 --> 30:29.300
Holiday cheer must be equally redistributed to all days.

30:29.300 --> 30:30.300
It's miserable.

30:30.300 --> 30:31.380
It's cold.

30:31.380 --> 30:32.500
Everybody's getting sick.

30:32.500 --> 30:33.940
All the plants are dead.

30:33.940 --> 30:38.260
There's too much stuff to do before the calendar year ends anyway, and it gets dark right after

30:38.260 --> 30:39.260
lunch.

30:39.260 --> 30:43.600
And because you have such a terrible time, everyone else must be miserable as well.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.840
We have to all be equal in our misery.

30:45.840 --> 30:48.000
Holidays, especially Christmas, make people sad.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.780
They make you sad if you have resigned yourself to being sad.

30:51.780 --> 30:57.360
You can be affected by tragedies in life sometimes, but if you let them rule your life to the

30:57.360 --> 31:02.080
point that years later they're destroying holidays for you, you have a serious problem

31:02.080 --> 31:04.040
and the problem is not with the holiday.

31:04.040 --> 31:07.360
You've surely read about the seasonal spike in suicide statistics.

31:07.360 --> 31:11.440
It turns out that spike is apocryphal, but its persistence as a trope is instructive.

31:11.440 --> 31:12.960
Well, no it's not.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.720
If it's not fucking true, it's not fucking true.

31:15.720 --> 31:19.860
Christmas and every other holiday simply marks a date on a calendar.

31:19.860 --> 31:21.720
An arbitrary point in time.

31:21.720 --> 31:24.360
Especially when you take into consideration the fluctuations in the rotation of the Earth

31:24.360 --> 31:25.360
and the lunar cycle.

31:25.360 --> 31:26.360
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

31:26.360 --> 31:29.880
This is something that I see a lot of lefties do, especially a lot of socialists.

31:29.880 --> 31:34.720
You see like Neil deGrasse Tyson talking about the new year is just an arbitrary day that

31:34.720 --> 31:36.120
doesn't really mean much.

31:36.120 --> 31:41.320
In fact, I guarantee you, check Twitter, January 1st, he's gonna have said something about

31:41.320 --> 31:42.320
that.

31:42.360 --> 31:47.600
He talks about how borders are just arbitrary lines that humans draw and have no real basis

31:47.600 --> 31:48.600
in reality.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.680
While at the same time, of course, having a wall around his house.

31:51.680 --> 31:55.920
The point is, is that when you get into the radical left, they believe that all human

31:55.920 --> 32:00.380
made distinctions are inherently meaningless and that if there is a value structure set

32:00.380 --> 32:02.840
up around them, it is inherently corrupt.

32:02.840 --> 32:06.760
That's why you have open borders activists, that's why you have people hating on holidays,

32:06.760 --> 32:11.200
that's why they hate corporate culture or frankly entrepreneurs or anybody who, you

32:11.200 --> 32:16.480
know, works hard or likes capitalism because capitalism itself is generally a hierarchy

32:16.480 --> 32:21.440
of competence and so they just want the bare fucking minimum of everything and they want

32:21.440 --> 32:25.960
everybody to only have the bare minimum so that everything can be equal.

32:25.960 --> 32:29.400
They'd rather people be equal than be free and in fact, you can see it right here.

32:29.400 --> 32:33.960
The best advice I've ever gotten, the surest path to happiness that I know is this, don't

32:33.960 --> 32:36.920
expect, don't expect anything ever.

32:36.920 --> 32:39.960
The less we expect, the happier we are.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.020
Expectation is the worst.

32:41.020 --> 32:46.520
It leads directly to disappointment, consistently, reliably, expectation produces misery.

32:46.520 --> 32:53.340
This person would rather have a safe, okay life living in squalor and having everybody

32:53.340 --> 32:57.760
else living in squalor with him so that he doesn't have to feel bad about being there

32:57.760 --> 33:03.680
than to take a chance, give it a go, endure the ups and downs of life and try to make

33:03.680 --> 33:05.000
something of yourself.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.380
And now we come to the absolute bottom of the barrel.

33:08.380 --> 33:10.500
No I will not wrap all the presents.

33:10.500 --> 33:13.900
Why are women still responsible for the holiday joy?

33:13.900 --> 33:15.460
Hello Jessica Valenti.

33:15.460 --> 33:19.740
Someday I will do a dissecting a degenerate on Jessica Valenti because she is absolutely

33:19.740 --> 33:20.740
ridiculous.

33:20.740 --> 33:24.060
The holidays bring another set of gendered expectations.

33:24.060 --> 33:28.220
This season should be all fun and family, not enduring more chores and consumerism.

33:28.220 --> 33:30.060
I love everything about the holiday season.

33:30.060 --> 33:34.140
I like the brisk weather, the festive wreaths, you've even decorated a tree already taught

33:34.140 --> 33:37.420
with a cardboard glitter star that I made with my daughter when she was two years old.

33:37.420 --> 33:38.900
It's the happiest season of all.

33:39.020 --> 33:43.300
Maybe you should be redistributing all of that holiday cheer to the other days evenly,

33:43.300 --> 33:46.000
like the previous article said if you want to be a good leftist.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.420
We all know that women do the majority of domestic work like childcare, housework and

33:49.420 --> 33:52.920
cooking, but the holidays bring on a whole new set of gendered expectations that make

33:52.920 --> 33:57.620
the season less about simply enjoying fun and family and more about enduring consumerism,

33:57.620 --> 33:59.120
chores and resentment.

33:59.120 --> 34:03.060
If a present doesn't get somewhere on time, if at all, if the cookies for the school's

34:03.060 --> 34:07.900
holiday bake-off are store-bought, or your family holiday cards arrive just shy of February,

34:07.900 --> 34:10.100
it's not men who get looked at askance.

34:10.100 --> 34:13.480
After decades of feminist progress, women are still considered primarily responsible

34:13.480 --> 34:15.380
for an entire family's holiday joy.

34:15.380 --> 34:19.540
I'm sorry that you live in this kind of relationship or this kind of family dynamic, but my girlfriend

34:19.540 --> 34:22.300
and I take the holiday joy equally.

34:22.300 --> 34:26.780
We wrap gifts together, we make meals together, and we spend time together.

34:26.780 --> 34:30.680
What is it with all of these fucking people just wanting to hate something that other

34:30.680 --> 34:31.760
people enjoy?

34:31.760 --> 34:35.220
So please, as the women in your lives work their fingers to the point of bringing you

34:35.220 --> 34:37.780
holiday cheer, get up and lend a hand.

34:37.780 --> 34:40.980
Santa's not the only one who keeps a list of who's naughty and nice.

34:40.980 --> 34:44.140
Oh god, this whole fucking thing is just stupid.

34:44.140 --> 34:49.120
Like she's saying, I want help, and you know what, that's fine, you should be getting help.

34:49.120 --> 34:53.040
Everyone should be given some help, especially when the chores start to rack up, not even

34:53.040 --> 34:54.500
in a Christmas sense.

34:54.500 --> 34:57.780
Like if the house is dirty, you should both be cleaning it.

34:57.780 --> 35:01.660
And if one person has more time at home than the other, then the one person should probably

35:01.660 --> 35:02.660
be cleaning it more.

35:02.660 --> 35:06.180
But that shouldn't be a gendered thing, it should be a responsibility thing.

35:06.180 --> 35:09.940
But look at how she titles it, I will not wrap all the presents.

35:09.940 --> 35:11.980
Why am I responsible for joy?

35:11.980 --> 35:16.020
How about everyone's responsible for joy, Jessica, including you?

35:16.020 --> 35:20.380
How about the solution is to not act like a petulant fucking child who didn't get what

35:20.380 --> 35:21.780
they wanted for Christmas?

35:21.780 --> 35:26.640
Well this has been an enjoyable Guardian Christmas, I am sure that these people are absolutely

35:26.640 --> 35:30.800
fucking insane, but you know what, it made for a good video, and I absolutely loved spending

35:30.800 --> 35:32.300
the day with you guys.

35:32.300 --> 35:36.980
And I'm going to continue to do so, because tonight I plan to do an extra long Christmas

35:36.980 --> 35:42.980
stream of Yakuza Kiwami, which is a game that takes place during Christmas, so it's appropriately

35:42.980 --> 35:43.980
festive.

35:43.980 --> 35:48.380
My girlfriend and I will be happy to spend Christmas with you guys over at twitch.tv

35:48.380 --> 35:49.900
slash Game Boomers.

35:49.900 --> 35:53.440
Merry Christmas everybody, I hope you all enjoyed your holiday, and I will leave you

35:53.440 --> 35:59.040
with a story told to me by somebody who's very active in my Discord, he's a very prominent

35:59.040 --> 36:03.920
member of the community, he's the guy who wrote the Sargon's Tea poem for D&D, so he

36:03.920 --> 36:07.760
definitely likes spinning a good yarn, and this one is all about Christmas.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.700
Catch you guys later, I love you.

36:09.700 --> 36:15.060
When I was in kindergarten, my dad thought it'd be a good idea to take me hunting on

36:15.060 --> 36:16.060
a Sunday.

36:16.060 --> 36:20.840
It's a foggy day, we're not seeing much, and then all of a sudden we see a deer.

36:20.840 --> 36:25.680
My dad blasted it, all exciting shit, and it ran off.

36:25.680 --> 36:31.600
He almost trips over the deer because it's so foggy, and then he notices it, he runs

36:31.600 --> 36:37.680
back to the truck, grabs me by the shoulders, saying, we got Bambi, we got Bambi.

36:37.680 --> 36:39.920
Now I had a little bit of a problem when I was a kid.

36:39.920 --> 36:42.840
I always got Bambi and Rudolph confused.

36:42.840 --> 36:50.200
I ended up telling the whole kindergarten the next day, I'm sorry, my daddy shot Rudolph,

36:50.200 --> 36:52.040
there will be no more Christmas.
