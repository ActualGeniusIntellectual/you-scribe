0	3300	I hope you're all having a very Merry Christmas.
3300	5060	This year, let's do something special.
5060	8060	Let's see what the Guardian has in store for Christmas.
8060	12340	I have a collection here of the crankiest Christmas-related Guardian articles I could
12340	13340	find.
13340	17360	This one is from this year, How to Survive Christmas One Step at a Time.
17360	22360	This kind of feels like that Anita Sarkeesian video about Thanksgiving, you know, surviving
22360	24780	the Thanksgiving with your shitty relatives.
24780	26620	I think this might be the same kind of thing.
26620	31340	It's useful to have a scapegoat at Christmas, so mine is the Industrial Revolution.
31340	34060	I... okay.
34060	41500	Yes, the Victorians are responsible for the festive fever dream of Dickensian jollity
41500	46980	we have all internalized, but it's those damn steam and steel barons who allowed us to escape
46980	48900	our families most of the year.
48900	54700	Yeah, capitalism, even in its worst form, did in fact produce some good things.
54700	58400	Since we stopped spending our lives confined to one room with several generations of people
58400	63020	seemingly put on Earth for the sole purpose of annoying us, we've lost the knack of just
63020	65620	tolerating our nearest and dearest, I think.
65620	69980	As a result, when Christmas rolls around, our lack of practice, deluded belief that
69980	74180	this is the time to forge heartwarming memories, and the hysterical exhortations of Yuletide
74180	77580	end-stage capitalism combine to ensure carnage.
77580	83820	I understand that sometimes you may have really terrible relatives, and seeing them can actually
83820	84820	be an ordeal.
84820	89540	However, I have a feeling that most of the young urban socialites nowadays just view
89540	94800	their entire family with disgust for little to no reason.
94800	98940	This article talks about a five-point plan on making it to New Year's.
98940	100420	Okay, let's see what they've got here.
100420	105920	I'll be applying a step-by-step approach to engineering peace on Earth and goodwill to
105920	107420	your UKIP uncle?
107420	111100	Does... does everyone in Britain have a UKIP uncle?
111100	112660	Are they that popular now?
112700	117660	I do like how we've gone from racist uncle to UKIP uncle, though it's quite the stretch.
117660	122880	The night before Christmas, the vision, the soaring voices of boy trebles and dancing
122880	126380	candlelight illuminating the darkness, a time of magic.
126380	132380	The reality, the last grainy chocolate-flavored blob has been retched from its cardboard sarcophagus,
132380	134980	but no one is tucked up dreaming of sugar plums.
134980	136740	What the hell is a sugar plum, anyway?
136740	142220	They've probably been reimagined as gilded edible mini-drones for $31.99.
142220	149940	See, I have a feeling that this article is mostly in jest, like, they're kind of overblowing
149940	153900	the Christmas season to make it seem better or worse than it actually is.
153900	159580	You know, in a national lampoon kind of way, where that movie was all about simultaneously
159580	163260	showing the best and worst parts of Christmas with your family?
163260	170460	Christmas morning, the vision, an explosion of joy, the reality, an explosion of plastic,
170460	176100	actual children and emotion, if stocking chocolate is not swiftly removed.
176100	180860	Family fight flashpoint, ingratitude timing squabbles, my husband blithely loading a plate
180860	183800	with the expense of Christmas salmon I was saving for lunch.
183800	187140	And this is what I mean about this article being half serious, half satire, because it's
187140	191500	filled with the vision, the reality, and the point at which the family starts fighting.
191500	196100	And you know what, this article I think is ultimately not so bad, but I do know that
196100	201720	we're only scratching the surface regarding how ridiculous The Guardian gets when it comes
201720	203620	to the Christmas season.
203620	207460	Of course, this person still ultimately likes to shove in their own brand of socialism by
207460	208460	the end of the article.
208460	212380	The family are your weirdos, cherish them and add this moment to your mental album of
212380	214780	festive lies, sorry, memories.
214780	218700	And remember, thanks to the Industrial Revolution, it will all be over soon.
218700	220860	Maybe for you, but not for the rest of us.
220860	224820	However, let's visit the ghost of Guardian past and take a look at some of their older
224820	225980	Christmas articles.
225980	232140	Why I've gone cold turkey on Christmas consumerism While everybody else endures the stress and
232140	235700	expense of preparing for the festivities, I'm sitting back and taking it easy.
235700	240460	This year, my considerably less wholesome family of two not-so-little women and one
240460	243860	baby boy will be having Christmas without any presents.
243860	245420	Okay, hardly any presents.
245420	249500	There will be a giant river penguin for the baby, a bottle of wine and a roast chicken
249500	253080	for my partner and me, and a rawhide cigar for the dog.
253080	256800	There will be a tree and it will have decorations, old ones, there will be good and bad films,
256800	257800	old ones.
257800	258800	Here's a picture around our hearth.
258800	259800	Where's the picture?
259800	260800	Is it this?
260800	261800	That's just a sprout.
261800	270380	There's no picture, did the picture disappear, did they just cut the picture out?
270380	273360	Is the Guardian running out of money so much that they're actually axing pictures out of
273360	274360	old articles?
274360	278400	But, nonetheless, there's no moral imperative to have a giant Christmas or to see every
278400	280660	single family member all the time.
280660	284260	You may remember it being that way when you were a kid, but I'm sure there were some Christmases
284260	288540	where it just didn't happen and your youngest memories start to blend together.
288540	292040	For example, this year, my girlfriend and I went back to my hometown for a couple days
292040	294860	and saw my parents, but only at the start of December.
294860	299340	We were there for like, I think it was December 2nd and December 3rd or something like that.
299340	301300	And this year, we're just hanging around the house.
301300	304700	We're not really doing anything, we're probably going to be streaming later.
304700	308500	I'm making homemade pizzas because I'm actually a pretty good cook in my opinion, but we're
308500	310260	not doing a traditional Christmas.
310260	314840	I do definitely understand the feeling that Christmas can be stressful, but I don't think
314840	321340	that it's just this end of time scenario that a lot of people, especially youngins on the
321340	323220	left like to consider it to be.
323220	328440	My son is now 15 months old, which means that although this isn't his first Christmas, it's
328440	333460	his first not spent breastfeeding his way through presents, lunch and my fair lady.
333460	337300	Permission to take yourself off to a corner, Nigel Farage, and cower beneath a makeshift
337300	338840	tent.
338840	343920	What is it with The Guardian and just shitting on UKIP every single article?
343920	346520	Are they honestly that afraid of the party?
346520	350520	Apparently this person's going cold turkey on Christmas consuming, or as she likes to
350520	353040	think of it, replacing shopping with living.
353040	357180	So on Black Friday, I borrowed three books for the baby from our local library.
357180	360800	On Cyber Monday, I spent nothing but some energy on feeling smug.
360800	366560	It's all taking me back to that vintage Christmas of 1988 where I took a book off my mom's shelf,
366560	369360	wrapped it and gave it right back to her.
369360	371940	She never realized and I never stopped congratulating myself.
371940	373680	It was the best of times.
373680	375600	Again I have to kind of agree with this article.
375600	381320	There is definitely some value in not spending thousands of fucking dollars on gifts.
381320	384640	But here's where the hatred of the holiday comes in.
384640	388720	In any case, Christmas is supposed to be cheap and nasty.
388720	394440	No matter how we try to rehash it, like that joyless stack of anally folded or rather pre-loved
394440	398720	wrapping paper that should have been loved just once and then ripped to shreds, Christmas
398720	400320	will never be cool.
400320	405420	This is why we love it and why, in these secular, straightened times, we stubbornly keep going
405420	409680	at it with tinsel on our heads and a song murdered by the X Factor in our hearts.
409680	412420	Doing Christmas on a shoestring budget isn't a lifestyle choice.
412420	416660	It's not about saving with Jamie by buying an enormous side of salmon and eating it for
416660	421420	a fortnight in 20 different ways until salmon and Christmas and leftovers are ruined forever.
421420	423540	Is salmon for Christmas a big thing in Britain?
423540	424740	Because it's not over here.
424740	429340	I mean, I've had salmon at Christmas before, but it's not considered a traditional dish
429340	430340	at all.
430340	431340	Over here it's definitely turkey.
431340	436320	Anyway, fine, this person thinks that Christmas is too consumeristic and doesn't want to participate.
436320	439720	But I think in missing it she misses part of the point.
439720	442320	But of course she obviously gets another part of the point.
442320	443320	So whatever.
443320	446020	Christmas Day is supposed to be dull.
446020	448460	Enjoy the novelty of utter boredom.
448460	451020	Let's see what this one's all about.
451020	452420	Don't catch up on the cereal.
452420	457040	Do as God intended and watch a war documentary with your extended family as time slows to
457040	458040	a crawl.
458040	464540	I can only wonder what kind of hellish family life you must have endured when you were a
464540	465540	kid.
465540	467960	I mean, my mom loves watching certain movies around Christmas every year.
467960	469700	She always watches The Sound of Music.
469700	471380	We always watch National Lampoon.
471380	474180	Charlie Brown usually comes on the TV once in a while.
474180	478200	There's a staple of movies and shows that just seem to be part of Christmas now, and
478200	479200	that's fine.
479200	486000	However, more recently I've noticed that on TV, on the week up to Christmas, certain
486000	491620	television stations will start playing on repeat like the entire Harry Potter series.
491620	494040	Or they'll play the Back to the Future trilogy.
494040	498480	You know, they'll just pull out these whimsical adventure stories that don't really have anything
498480	502080	to do with Christmas at all, and they'll just play them.
502080	508080	And for the past ten years or so, if I'm ever at my parents' place for Christmas, which
508080	513640	isn't much anymore, but does happen sometimes, one of those movies will be playing on TV
513640	517500	in the background while we're opening Christmas gifts on Christmas morning.
517500	523460	If you have a family situation where time slows to a crawl, you may need to recognize
523460	526920	that that may be unique to you.
526920	527920	Maybe not completely unique.
527920	531440	Like I said, there's always some bad families out there, and there's always going to be
531440	532760	some people you want to avoid.
532760	537320	But to straight up say that because you have regular negative experiences that Christmas
537560	543360	day is supposed to be dull, I think the problem might be with you.
543360	546780	How to keep your Christmas spirit when all about you are losing theirs.
546780	550360	It's an annual conundrum, particularly as you get older and less inclined to make any
550360	551860	effort whatsoever.
551860	556800	The war on Christmas, as anyone not watching the Nativity Facts, Fictions, and Faith on
556800	561800	Fox News at this very moment is well aware, isn't prosecuted by a loose collective of
561800	565600	socialists, atheists, and alternative religions.
565600	568920	Also you didn't say loose, you said lose.
568920	574200	And yes, I would consider these groups, with the exception of the atheists, sometimes to
574200	575800	be fucking losers.
575800	581240	No, the real war is being fought by the forces of Christmas capitalism, those which burn
581240	585320	joy out of the season with the intensity of a Star Wars lightsaber, 25% off till New Year's
585320	586320	Day.
586320	590320	Okay, I think there's going to be a common thread throughout all these articles, and
590320	596240	it's going to be the fact that you gotta pay for shit during Christmas and people don't
596240	600840	like that, because if you write for the Guardian, you're probably a fucking socialist.
600840	603520	The entire point of Christmas is that it's supposed to be boring.
603520	607440	You get an hour of excitement first thing and then the day devolves into an endless
607440	612440	cycle of cooking, small talk, snoring relatives, overheated rooms with no escape, and in England
612440	614320	at least, the Queen's Speech.
614320	619240	Then comes the slow, dull glide into evening, with its massive sense of anti-climax.
619240	624040	Like the worst Sunday night before school feeling, tinged with senses of loss, aging,
624040	627220	and the terrible, terrible transience of it all.
627220	631560	This is somebody who has not come to grips with their own mortality.
631560	636080	And I know it's strange to bring that up in a video about fucking Christmas, but I honestly
636080	637440	think it's the case.
637440	642080	This is somebody who is saying, when I was a kid, it was so fun, I was getting gifts
642080	646600	from my parents, there were new games and toys and everything was magical, it was great.
646600	648520	Look at her up here.
648520	652720	The most exciting element of Christmas used to be the snow beneath the tree, made of packing
652720	656600	material, which I remember thrillingly retained one's teeth marks when you bit in.
656600	661200	She's complaining now that, at least in some ways, Christmas is a holiday for children
661200	663320	and she's no longer a child.
663320	667700	And she has not been able to find a Christmas for adults that she can enjoy.
667700	671480	So she's just sitting around, being bored.
671480	674020	And complaining about the fact that she's getting old.
674020	677560	Continuing down the socialist rabbit hole, the real war on Christmas is our corporate
677560	679800	driven material culture.
679800	684680	Corporate Christmas is not a time of humble reflection, charity and modesty, it is a market
684680	686660	opportunity to be exploited.
686660	691320	Forget goodwill towards men, forget Charlie Brown, instead the commando wing of Disney's
691320	696280	media army has produced a climate warming suburban energy vampire version of dueling
696280	697280	banjos.
697280	701780	No, there's no room at the inn for something as outdated as goodwill when families go head
701780	707300	to head matching wits and carbon footprints in a contrived reality showdown, and the winner
707300	708520	gets money.
708520	711380	Each episode ends with $50,000 awarded to the victorious family.
711380	715520	What they're talking about is a show called The Great Christmas Light Fight, which is
715520	721440	just basically an attempt to make the most overblown Christmas light setup I have ever
721440	722620	seen in my life.
722620	725500	This is in fact worse than National Lampoon's lights.
725500	729500	The only thing that matches ABC's too close to the bone expression of a corporately sponsored
729500	734560	Christmas is America's annual Black Friday devilish and derby, and the desperate consumerism
734560	735980	that fuels it.
735980	740940	All videos of the violent scrum have become a tradition too, with each passing year the
740940	744260	kickoff to the profitable holiday season looks more and more like a kickoff to a football
744260	748040	game as retailers keep their stores open and their minds closed to anything other than
748040	750660	squeezing a little more profit out of embattled consumers.
750660	754740	I could say that this is a problem with American culture because if there's one thing that
754740	760260	Americans are known for overseas, and even in Canada, which is obviously a foreign nation
760260	764900	member, it's not overseas, it's not even American militarism, though that's pretty
764900	768380	high up there, it's American overconsumption.
768380	772620	So there's definitely a statement to be made about American overconsumption.
772620	776540	If you look at Suda51's games, like Killer7 or No More Heroes or whatever, those games
776540	781580	are basically all about American overconsumption, that would be the thematic element of those
781580	782580	games.
782580	787500	So there's definitely this idea overseas that American culture is basically the stereotypical
787500	791140	fat guy in a hover around eating McDonalds.
791140	795620	But there's something else to talk about here that's not just overconsumption, it's competition.
795620	801180	You look at the great Christmas light fight, it's not just the fact that they're creating
801180	803940	these monstrosities, it's the fact that they're competing.
803940	808300	And you look at stores in Black Friday, yes there are crowds who are clamoring to get
808300	811100	a hold of something, but they describe it as a kickoff.
811100	814140	And if you read the rest of the article and you kind of look at some of the language they
814140	820460	use, like they talk about the Alamo, they talk about Christmas soldiers and etc.
820460	825340	It really does seem that a lot of the problem that this person has with it is that, not
825340	829680	that it's over-consumeristic, although it is, it's that it's competitive.
829680	837040	And I'm not surprised at all that a socialist would be anti-competitive, because competition
837040	838760	is inherently capitalist.
838760	845640	The fact that maybe there are a group of people, all with varying levels of skill and experience,
845640	849680	competing to try and come out on top, and that there are winners and losers, and that
849680	854920	the spoils of the competition go disproportionately to the winners because they have won.
854920	858480	I can see exactly why a socialist would find that offensive.
858480	863880	So variety at Christmas is a challenge, but it's better than the alternative.
863880	865540	I'm somebody who doesn't drink, ever.
865540	870260	I haven't had a drop of alcohol in about five years.
870260	872780	I haven't been drunk in about ten.
872780	877800	And I'm not about to start now, I have no desire to drink at all.
877800	880500	So maybe I'm not going to be able to understand this article as well as the previous ones.
880500	884020	I could kind of read into the subtext of the previous ones, maybe not so much this one.
884020	888260	I remember clearly, indeed it's one of the few things I do remember, this counselor turning
888260	890540	to me and asking if I had drunk enough.
890540	894960	I must have been in my mid-twenties at the time and I couldn't quite grasp what he meant.
894960	898640	At best I found his tone flippant, antagonistic even.
898640	901740	It would be another fifteen years before I fully understood what a pertinent question
901740	902740	he'd raised.
902740	907680	This is something I've noticed, I've known a few alcoholics in my life, and if you ever
907680	913960	ask them, you know, have you drunk enough, they will get extremely defensive.
913960	918140	If you're talking to a non-alcoholic who's drinking and you ask them have you had enough,
918140	920560	they'll say yes or they'll say no, depending on what the answer is.
920560	925200	But if you ask an alcoholic that question, they take it as a personal slight.
925200	928680	And so it's Christmas again, and do you know something, this would be my third Christmas
928680	929680	sober.
929680	933880	And when I say sober, I mean sober, not a dry drunk, my tongue hanging out and desperate.
933880	936760	In other words, I did eventually drink enough.
936760	940520	And I was sitting here quietly the other night when a wave of joy washed over me.
940520	942440	I don't crave alcohol.
942440	946360	Not that this was an epiphany, but at this time of year, what a powerful reminder of
946360	948000	just how lucky I am.
948000	952720	I'm going to assume that this is written by an alcoholic who has given up drinking and
952720	957680	now he has progressed to the point where he no longer feels the urge to drink anymore.
957680	961600	And if that's the case, you know, congratulations, it's tough to get out of, man.
961600	962600	You know what?
962600	966240	I completely understand my relatively unique point of view on this topic, but this is actually
966240	968400	a very reasonable article.
968400	973600	It's just basically about a former alcoholic, and I'm genuinely proud of what this person's
973600	974600	accomplished.
974600	979400	However, in Guardian fashion, they did write the headline as if it's another one of those
979400	981460	I hate my family articles.
981460	985380	And speaking of hating your family, Christmas is ruined by children.
985380	995120	Our overindulgent society has turned children into greedy little emperors.
995120	998440	Thanks Santa, I can look forward to a Christmas with adults.
998440	1000140	Children ruin Christmas.
1000140	1002260	I know this because I've done it myself.
1002260	1007020	As a small boy growing up in the early 1970s, I had my heart set on an astronaut outfit.
1007020	1010300	Turns out my mother had left it too late and all she could find in the toy shop, space
1010300	1011940	man wise, was the helmet.
1011940	1017380	The fury of a disappointed, petulant child knows no bounds and I screamed, then cried,
1017380	1021660	then threw the helmet across the room and made my family's Christmas utterly miserable.
1021660	1024380	My parents were on eggshells for the rest of the day.
1024380	1027420	My sisters opened their presents in embarrassed silence.
1027420	1028860	Even the dog looked depressed.
1028860	1031900	It sounds like you might have been a terrible child.
1031900	1035620	Alternatively, it also sounds like you could have just had one of those days that children
1035620	1036620	have.
1036620	1040740	It doesn't excuse it, but every kid has a day where they act like little shit.
1040740	1042900	It doesn't make them a bad person.
1042900	1046980	I can remember days when I acted like that, and as an adult, thinking back, I am embarrassed
1046980	1052820	of them now, but it is something that every kid goes through and it's the parents responsibility
1052820	1055360	to teach them why they can't do that.
1055360	1060160	The traditional, and let's face it, slightly sickening Christmas image of the whole family
1060160	1065040	joyously opening presents around a real tree, grateful for the gifts they receive, is woefully
1065040	1068040	outdated if it ever existed in the first place.
1068040	1071500	The reality of the modern Christmas nightmare is more like this.
1071500	1075720	You bought the wrong Xbox game for your 10 year old son, and the trainers you bought
1075720	1078200	for your daughter, the apple of your eye.
1078200	1080820	Why isn't your son the apple of your eye?
1080820	1081820	Why not both of them?
1081820	1084200	Are you actually playing favorites here?
1084200	1086240	Were fashionable last year.
1086240	1089860	That's why they were so heavily discounted, but you do like a bargain.
1089860	1093460	As for the mobile phones you thoughtfully got for them despite their tender years because
1093460	1097140	everyone else in their class has one, don't even go there.
1097140	1101080	Your delightful progeny are now weeping with rage at your ineptitude and hate you for ruining
1101080	1102260	their day.
1102260	1104140	You don't know anything about anything.
1104140	1106700	You are an idiot.
1106700	1111700	If this is happening every single Christmas, not just once in a while because, you know,
1111700	1116500	kids sometimes throw tantrums for bad reasons, even the best ones, or there might even be
1116500	1124500	a problem with your kid mentally or psychologically, but if not any of those reasons, if this happens
1124500	1129140	every single Christmas, that means you probably suck at disciplining your children.
1129140	1132020	On the one hand, I hate the mentality that you should always be thankful for the things
1132020	1135860	that you're given because if someone just hands you a pile of garbage, you're not going
1135860	1137340	to say thank you for this garbage.
1137340	1141700	However, on the other hand, if someone has made a good faith attempt at trying to brighten
1141700	1146580	your day and then they fail at it, you should still be thankful for the attempt and it's
1146580	1148660	important to teach your kids that too.
1148660	1151520	If you haven't taught them that, you've failed as a parent.
1151520	1156220	The idea that parents these days are time poor and overcompensate for this by indulging
1156220	1160540	their offspring is so familiar as to have become a cliche, but it's true.
1160540	1165060	We seem to be hell bent on creating our own versions of China's little emperors and all
1165060	1168740	this over pampering and overindulgence means that children aren't able to cope with not
1168740	1169740	getting what they want.
1169740	1170940	Yeah, that's true, isn't it?
1170940	1172560	Maybe you should have done something about that.
1172560	1174860	Maybe you should have adjusted how you raised your children.
1174860	1178800	Maybe you should have done it before they all moved off to university and started shitting
1178800	1181900	up the rest of society with their snowflake bullshit.
1181900	1184980	Why I'm opting out of Christmas.
1184980	1187420	Is it because you're a cat lady?
1187420	1191040	We have ruined Christmas by allowing capitalism to tell us we should be buying ourselves into
1191040	1193300	an orgy of goodwill and glamour.
1193300	1194900	An orgy of goodwill!
1194900	1201280	There's few things in the world that sound better than, say, an orgy of goodwill.
1201280	1206660	Being under house arrest with a group of disharmonious, sherry-heavy relatives slow-roasting in front
1206660	1210300	of a flickering television with nothing to look forward to but a ten-minute montage of
1210300	1212140	royalist propaganda isn't great.
1212140	1216520	I once spent Christmas morning hiding in a coal shed with a bottle of Morrison's Cava
1216520	1220380	and a packet of my grandmother's cigarettes, planning how to make my escape to freedom.
1220380	1223660	Aged 14, I was left to cook dinner while my mother locked herself in the bathroom and
1223660	1225380	a giant dog defecated on the lawn.
1225380	1230100	Yeah, see, sometimes you have shitty families.
1230100	1233100	Sometimes you are the shitty person in the family.
1233100	1234180	Sometimes it's both.
1234180	1235180	Maybe here it's both.
1235180	1239280	Christmas is the stick with which millions of us beat ourselves into brandy-soaked agony
1239280	1244320	for being poor, single, childless, lonely, or simply bad at being jolly.
1244320	1247820	You don't have to have all of those markers to have a good life.
1247820	1249380	You probably need some of them.
1249380	1253100	You know, there are certainly some universals that humans need, you know?
1253540	1254540	You need a way to provide for yourself.
1254540	1257620	You need something useful to spend your time on outside of work.
1257620	1258620	You need a relationship.
1258620	1259620	You need a family.
1259620	1260620	You need kids.
1260620	1262660	You don't need all of these things, but you need some of them.
1262660	1266620	If you don't have at least some of them, you're probably going to have a terrible life.
1266620	1271460	And the problem isn't just to scream at society or scream at Christmas every time it comes
1271460	1272460	around.
1272460	1275200	Maybe you should examine your life and figure out why you hate it when other people have
1275200	1276200	so much fun.
1276200	1278180	But here's the person's solution.
1278180	1279380	Stop giving presents.
1279380	1280860	Stop watching television.
1280860	1282820	Stop comparing yourself to advertisements.
1282820	1284680	And actually spend it with people you like.
1284680	1287180	This year, however, I am opting out altogether.
1287180	1289060	I shan't be driving home for Christmas.
1289060	1293580	I have no tree, have wrapped no presents, will eat no turkey, and mull no wine.
1293580	1297880	Instead, I shall go for a run, listen to the headlines, eat a baked potato, and watch a
1297880	1299380	Western with my mother.
1299380	1303300	On Christmas Eve, I plan to volunteer at the Hackney Care Leavers Christmas dinner, but
1303300	1305980	the day itself is as blank as a fresh fall of snow.
1305980	1306980	I can't wait.
1306980	1307980	And that's fine.
1307980	1310780	You can spend Christmas or any other day however you like.
1310780	1313380	But it doesn't need to be a fucking Guardian article.
1313380	1316980	You don't need to tell everybody how you've discovered the true way to spend Christmas
1316980	1319780	happy, not doing Christmas at all.
1319780	1324380	Maybe you should just do the things that you like to do and allow other people to do the
1324380	1326620	things that they like to do unmolested.
1326620	1331420	And if you find yourself either not having fun doing the things that you thought you
1331420	1334860	liked, or alternatively looking at people who are doing something more traditional and
1334860	1339460	having an irrational rage towards them, then maybe you need to examine your own life.
1339460	1343260	Warning, your festive meal could be more damaging than a long-haul flight.
1343260	1345500	This is going to be like a vegan article, isn't it?
1345500	1349520	Eating certain meats is about the worst thing you can do to the planet, yeah, yeah, vegan.
1349520	1354100	A kilogram of beef protein reared on a British Hill farm can generate the equivalent of 643
1354100	1355380	kilograms of carbon dioxide.
1355380	1360460	A kilogram of lamb protein produced in the same place can generate 749 kilograms.
1360460	1365460	One kilo of protein from either source, in other words, causes more greenhouse gas emissions
1365460	1367800	than a passenger flying from London to New York.
1367800	1372260	The figures are so high because modern animal husbandry is so unproductive.
1372260	1376260	To produce one lamb, you need to keep a large area of land bare and fertilized.
1376260	1379880	The animal must roam the hills to find its food, burning more fat and producing more
1379880	1382440	methane than a stalled beast would.
1382440	1386400	Environmentalism is probably the only place that I side consistently more with the left
1386400	1393220	than the right than any other part of politics, just because there's some undeniable truth
1393220	1396320	regarding humanity's impact on the environment.
1396320	1401680	The idea that global warming, for example, or climate change is just a Chinese myth,
1401680	1404760	as Trump described it, is completely stupid.
1404760	1407680	Very clearly we have an impact on the environment.
1407680	1413200	Very clearly the things that we do impact the situation that we find ourselves in.
1413200	1416400	We are not somehow separate from the rest of the world and we're not special in that
1416400	1417400	regard.
1417400	1423340	At the same time, this entire article has been about the various costs of raising animals
1423340	1424340	certain ways.
1424340	1427060	And it has yet to come into Christmas, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be something
1427060	1431220	along the lines of, if you eat a big turkey dinner or something, then you are destroying
1431220	1432220	the planet.
1432220	1435640	As we approach the end of the ride, there's a few crazy ones right here.
1435640	1440540	Sweden makes my gender-free toy Christmas wish come true.
1440540	1444320	With a picture of a girl with a Nerf gun, a Swedish toy retailer is arming children
1444320	1446640	with the ability to question outdated gender roles.
1446640	1449000	Well guess what, miss not progressive enough?
1449000	1453160	Swedish toy retailers are also training women to become active shooters.
1453160	1457700	All I want for Christmas is an end to the mandatory gendering of every children's toy.
1457700	1460560	They're not gendered.
1460560	1464960	There might be a boy or a girl on the box, and I'm sure that's fucking traumatizing for
1464960	1469560	you, but you know what, if your little girl wants a Nerf gun, buy her the Nerf gun.
1469560	1472920	If your little boy wants a doll, you can always buy him the doll.
1472920	1475760	It's kind of like the pink tax bullshit.
1475760	1482020	If the men and women's products are the same fucking thing, but the women's costs more,
1482020	1483020	just buy the men's.
1483020	1484100	What does it matter?
1484100	1488240	The amazing thing is that gender roles for children have become so calcified that such
1488240	1490860	petty things can be presented as radical.
1490860	1493540	Sample headline from the Daily Mail, Dolls?
1493540	1494840	They're not just for girls.
1494840	1499340	Which of course relies on the voice of your inner UKIP voter shouting, yes, dolls are
1499340	1500340	just for girls.
1500340	1505700	Okay, we should probably have had like a UKIP counter in this video, because how many times
1505700	1507620	has UKIP been scapegoated so far?
1507620	1508620	Five times?
1508620	1512820	A lot of people will try to tell you that boys just don't like playing with dolls.
1512820	1516840	Coincidentally, these same people also tell any boys in their vicinity that boys don't
1516840	1518460	play with dolls.
1518460	1522940	It's not an innate sexual difference that makes girls and boys play either side of the
1522940	1527900	pink-blue divide, it's adults constantly impressing on their charges that one group of toys is
1527900	1529940	right and the other is wrong.
1529940	1535100	I remember having a doll house in fact, and I asked my mom, I was maybe five years old
1535100	1539060	or something at the time, you know, I was in fact the woke child everyone talks about
1539060	1540060	on Twitter.
1540060	1545420	I asked my mom, hey, um, is it all right that I, if I play with a doll house, even though
1545420	1546420	I'm a boy?
1546420	1549060	And my mom said, well, it doesn't matter, you know, play with it, play with whatever
1549060	1550060	you want.
1550060	1551060	If you're having fun, what does it matter?
1551060	1552060	And I said, yeah, it didn't matter.
1552060	1553060	And you know what?
1553060	1558540	Um, at the time I was seven or eight, I had naturally grown out of playing with dolls
1558540	1559540	and doll houses.
1559540	1562780	And if I hadn't grown out of playing with dolls and doll houses, it would have been
1562780	1563780	fine as well.
1563780	1569220	And I think there definitely is a biological divide here, at least on some level, you know,
1569220	1573780	it's no secret that, you know, on average, and we're talking like a very large average
1573780	1576660	because we're talking about 50% of the entire human population.
1576660	1580180	So it's not at all going to be consistent all the time.
1580180	1585300	But on average, boys prefer things and girls prefer people.
1585300	1591100	So boys generally enjoy, you know, like, uh, children's tool sets or cars or whatever.
1591300	1593780	And girls generally enjoy dolls and doll houses.
1593780	1600020	And if you happen to have a boy or a girl that likes both or only likes the other gender's
1600020	1601300	toys, that's fine too.
1601300	1602300	It's not a big deal.
1602300	1606340	I don't think it's something that needs correction through social engineering.
1606340	1610500	I was determined to give my first child a beginning free from gender dogma.
1610500	1615460	So it was both brilliant and slightly blindsiding when aged three, his Christmas list led off
1615460	1616940	with a baby and a buggy.
1616940	1618740	Okay, well, I mean, good for him.
1618740	1622620	He wanted a toy baby and he wanted a toy buggy to push him around in.
1622620	1623620	That's fine.
1623620	1626380	But the pink pox couldn't be kept out forever.
1626380	1630780	It seemed to arrive in the space of a single week, a preschool room full of stripey t-shirts
1630780	1634300	and denim half erupting in tiaras and princess dresses.
1634300	1638300	Us parents had enjoyed a good run, but our children had finally twigged that greater
1638300	1641820	forces wanted them to conform to a certain pair of types.
1641820	1644900	At first, my reaction to this was one of cynical resignation.
1644900	1648500	Of course, we couldn't win against the masked forces of Disney and Mattel.
1648500	1650060	Why had we even tried?
1650060	1651860	Maybe it wasn't Disney and Mattel.
1651860	1657340	Maybe it was because as children go from three to five and then from five to eight and then
1657340	1664380	from eight to the teenage years, certain forces as they grow up, including but not limited
1664380	1669420	to puberty, start to make boys and girls act a little bit different from each other.
1669420	1674000	And moreover, if they're enjoying themselves, if once they've kind of gone through their
1674000	1678800	split and now they're happy being whatever gender they are, if they're happy, what does
1678800	1679800	it matter?
1679800	1685320	The Christmas shutdown just makes us drunker, fatter, lazier, and lonelier.
1685320	1692080	Buddy, this picture shows you to probably be drunker, fatter, lazier, and lonelier,
1692080	1693880	and you're looking for something to blame it on?
1693880	1698880	I guess there was a rail shutdown in 2014 in the UK.
1698880	1701660	During Christmas, no public transport moves.
1701660	1707620	To get from A to Z without a private car and overpriced taxi is impossible.
1707620	1713240	This is your complaint, that the buses don't run on Christmas Day.
1713240	1714240	Is that it?
1714240	1719180	When aircraft touch down at, say, Heathrow, their passengers find themselves marooned.
1719180	1724340	The country beyond the airport is impenetrable unless they can afford its inflated cab fares.
1724340	1730300	It lies there, hushed and immobile, smelling faintly of roasts, quite unlike anywhere else.
1730300	1732380	This is really where you're going with this, isn't it?
1732380	1734500	You can't catch the bus.
1734500	1736860	You can't catch the bus on the 25th.
1736860	1738660	So it's a big fucking problem.
1738660	1741540	This article is mainly just a big fat complaint.
1741540	1743380	It's not really worth going into.
1743380	1749140	But why does the end of it have something about Nigel Farage's coat?
1749140	1750500	It's not like it's a new article.
1750500	1755100	It still has the end of, it just has an excerpt.
1755100	1758820	Even reading it, it's an excerpt from a different article.
1758820	1759820	Did something fuck up?
1760340	1764820	Sometimes on some websites, if you scroll down long enough, the article changes, right?
1764820	1766980	You'll even see the URL change.
1766980	1769660	But this time, it doesn't happen at all.
1769660	1774460	They just tacked on the end of a different article into this one.
1774460	1775940	Here's another angry soy boy.
1775940	1779120	It's time for a real war on Christmas.
1779120	1783260	This is definitely not the most wonderful time of the year.
1783260	1787780	I'm not surprised that even in 2014, you were a fucking NPC, buddy.
1787780	1789180	Let's cancel Christmas.
1789180	1790180	No.
1790180	1793260	I understand that this is last minute, and some of you may have already started ordering
1793260	1796940	presents for family and loved ones on Amazon, bought airplane tickets, or planned a menu
1796940	1797940	for the big family meal.
1797940	1798940	But hear me out.
1798940	1803020	I think we will be better off, all of us as individuals, everyone together, society, the
1803020	1806200	world, if we stop celebrating this holiday.
1806200	1809740	In truth, I think we'd be better off if we stopped celebrating all holidays.
1809740	1811380	Holidays are stupid.
1811380	1812920	Everything must be equalized.
1812920	1814180	Everything must be the same.
1814180	1821500	The entire world must be a globe of tasteless, valueless, grey paste.
1821500	1823380	Differences are oppressive.
1823380	1825580	Value hierarchies do not exist.
1825580	1829300	Holiday cheer must be equally redistributed to all days.
1829300	1830300	It's miserable.
1830300	1831380	It's cold.
1831380	1832500	Everybody's getting sick.
1832500	1833940	All the plants are dead.
1833940	1838260	There's too much stuff to do before the calendar year ends anyway, and it gets dark right after
1838260	1839260	lunch.
1839260	1843600	And because you have such a terrible time, everyone else must be miserable as well.
1843600	1845840	We have to all be equal in our misery.
1845840	1848000	Holidays, especially Christmas, make people sad.
1848000	1851780	They make you sad if you have resigned yourself to being sad.
1851780	1857360	You can be affected by tragedies in life sometimes, but if you let them rule your life to the
1857360	1862080	point that years later they're destroying holidays for you, you have a serious problem
1862080	1864040	and the problem is not with the holiday.
1864040	1867360	You've surely read about the seasonal spike in suicide statistics.
1867360	1871440	It turns out that spike is apocryphal, but its persistence as a trope is instructive.
1871440	1872960	Well, no it's not.
1873000	1875720	If it's not fucking true, it's not fucking true.
1875720	1879860	Christmas and every other holiday simply marks a date on a calendar.
1879860	1881720	An arbitrary point in time.
1881720	1884360	Especially when you take into consideration the fluctuations in the rotation of the Earth
1884360	1885360	and the lunar cycle.
1885360	1886360	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
1886360	1889880	This is something that I see a lot of lefties do, especially a lot of socialists.
1889880	1894720	You see like Neil deGrasse Tyson talking about the new year is just an arbitrary day that
1894720	1896120	doesn't really mean much.
1896120	1901320	In fact, I guarantee you, check Twitter, January 1st, he's gonna have said something about
1901320	1902320	that.
1902360	1907600	He talks about how borders are just arbitrary lines that humans draw and have no real basis
1907600	1908600	in reality.
1908600	1911680	While at the same time, of course, having a wall around his house.
1911680	1915920	The point is, is that when you get into the radical left, they believe that all human
1915920	1920380	made distinctions are inherently meaningless and that if there is a value structure set
1920380	1922840	up around them, it is inherently corrupt.
1922840	1926760	That's why you have open borders activists, that's why you have people hating on holidays,
1926760	1931200	that's why they hate corporate culture or frankly entrepreneurs or anybody who, you
1931200	1936480	know, works hard or likes capitalism because capitalism itself is generally a hierarchy
1936480	1941440	of competence and so they just want the bare fucking minimum of everything and they want
1941440	1945960	everybody to only have the bare minimum so that everything can be equal.
1945960	1949400	They'd rather people be equal than be free and in fact, you can see it right here.
1949400	1953960	The best advice I've ever gotten, the surest path to happiness that I know is this, don't
1953960	1956920	expect, don't expect anything ever.
1956920	1959960	The less we expect, the happier we are.
1959960	1961020	Expectation is the worst.
1961020	1966520	It leads directly to disappointment, consistently, reliably, expectation produces misery.
1966520	1973340	This person would rather have a safe, okay life living in squalor and having everybody
1973340	1977760	else living in squalor with him so that he doesn't have to feel bad about being there
1977760	1983680	than to take a chance, give it a go, endure the ups and downs of life and try to make
1983680	1985000	something of yourself.
1985000	1988380	And now we come to the absolute bottom of the barrel.
1988380	1990500	No I will not wrap all the presents.
1990500	1993900	Why are women still responsible for the holiday joy?
1993900	1995460	Hello Jessica Valenti.
1995460	1999740	Someday I will do a dissecting a degenerate on Jessica Valenti because she is absolutely
1999740	2000740	ridiculous.
2000740	2004060	The holidays bring another set of gendered expectations.
2004060	2008220	This season should be all fun and family, not enduring more chores and consumerism.
2008220	2010060	I love everything about the holiday season.
2010060	2014140	I like the brisk weather, the festive wreaths, you've even decorated a tree already taught
2014140	2017420	with a cardboard glitter star that I made with my daughter when she was two years old.
2017420	2018900	It's the happiest season of all.
2019020	2023300	Maybe you should be redistributing all of that holiday cheer to the other days evenly,
2023300	2026000	like the previous article said if you want to be a good leftist.
2026000	2029420	We all know that women do the majority of domestic work like childcare, housework and
2029420	2032920	cooking, but the holidays bring on a whole new set of gendered expectations that make
2032920	2037620	the season less about simply enjoying fun and family and more about enduring consumerism,
2037620	2039120	chores and resentment.
2039120	2043060	If a present doesn't get somewhere on time, if at all, if the cookies for the school's
2043060	2047900	holiday bake-off are store-bought, or your family holiday cards arrive just shy of February,
2047900	2050100	it's not men who get looked at askance.
2050100	2053480	After decades of feminist progress, women are still considered primarily responsible
2053480	2055380	for an entire family's holiday joy.
2055380	2059540	I'm sorry that you live in this kind of relationship or this kind of family dynamic, but my girlfriend
2059540	2062300	and I take the holiday joy equally.
2062300	2066780	We wrap gifts together, we make meals together, and we spend time together.
2066780	2070680	What is it with all of these fucking people just wanting to hate something that other
2070680	2071760	people enjoy?
2071760	2075220	So please, as the women in your lives work their fingers to the point of bringing you
2075220	2077780	holiday cheer, get up and lend a hand.
2077780	2080980	Santa's not the only one who keeps a list of who's naughty and nice.
2080980	2084140	Oh god, this whole fucking thing is just stupid.
2084140	2089120	Like she's saying, I want help, and you know what, that's fine, you should be getting help.
2089120	2093040	Everyone should be given some help, especially when the chores start to rack up, not even
2093040	2094500	in a Christmas sense.
2094500	2097780	Like if the house is dirty, you should both be cleaning it.
2097780	2101660	And if one person has more time at home than the other, then the one person should probably
2101660	2102660	be cleaning it more.
2102660	2106180	But that shouldn't be a gendered thing, it should be a responsibility thing.
2106180	2109940	But look at how she titles it, I will not wrap all the presents.
2109940	2111980	Why am I responsible for joy?
2111980	2116020	How about everyone's responsible for joy, Jessica, including you?
2116020	2120380	How about the solution is to not act like a petulant fucking child who didn't get what
2120380	2121780	they wanted for Christmas?
2121780	2126640	Well this has been an enjoyable Guardian Christmas, I am sure that these people are absolutely
2126640	2130800	fucking insane, but you know what, it made for a good video, and I absolutely loved spending
2130800	2132300	the day with you guys.
2132300	2136980	And I'm going to continue to do so, because tonight I plan to do an extra long Christmas
2136980	2142980	stream of Yakuza Kiwami, which is a game that takes place during Christmas, so it's appropriately
2142980	2143980	festive.
2143980	2148380	My girlfriend and I will be happy to spend Christmas with you guys over at twitch.tv
2148380	2149900	slash Game Boomers.
2149900	2153440	Merry Christmas everybody, I hope you all enjoyed your holiday, and I will leave you
2153440	2159040	with a story told to me by somebody who's very active in my Discord, he's a very prominent
2159040	2163920	member of the community, he's the guy who wrote the Sargon's Tea poem for D&D, so he
2163920	2167760	definitely likes spinning a good yarn, and this one is all about Christmas.
2167760	2169700	Catch you guys later, I love you.
2169700	2175060	When I was in kindergarten, my dad thought it'd be a good idea to take me hunting on
2175060	2176060	a Sunday.
2176060	2180840	It's a foggy day, we're not seeing much, and then all of a sudden we see a deer.
2180840	2185680	My dad blasted it, all exciting shit, and it ran off.
2185680	2191600	He almost trips over the deer because it's so foggy, and then he notices it, he runs
2191600	2197680	back to the truck, grabs me by the shoulders, saying, we got Bambi, we got Bambi.
2197680	2199920	Now I had a little bit of a problem when I was a kid.
2199920	2202840	I always got Bambi and Rudolph confused.
2202840	2210200	I ended up telling the whole kindergarten the next day, I'm sorry, my daddy shot Rudolph,
2210200	2212040	there will be no more Christmas.
