1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
I hope you're all having a very Merry Christmas.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,060
This year, let's do something special.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,060
Let's see what the Guardian has in store for Christmas.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,340
I have a collection here of the crankiest Christmas-related Guardian articles I could

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,340
find.

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,360
This one is from this year, How to Survive Christmas One Step at a Time.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,360
This kind of feels like that Anita Sarkeesian video about Thanksgiving, you know, surviving

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,780
the Thanksgiving with your shitty relatives.

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,620
I think this might be the same kind of thing.

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,340
It's useful to have a scapegoat at Christmas, so mine is the Industrial Revolution.

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,060
I... okay.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:41,500
Yes, the Victorians are responsible for the festive fever dream of Dickensian jollity

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,980
we have all internalized, but it's those damn steam and steel barons who allowed us to escape

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,900
our families most of the year.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:54,700
Yeah, capitalism, even in its worst form, did in fact produce some good things.

16
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,400
Since we stopped spending our lives confined to one room with several generations of people

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,020
seemingly put on Earth for the sole purpose of annoying us, we've lost the knack of just

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,620
tolerating our nearest and dearest, I think.

19
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,980
As a result, when Christmas rolls around, our lack of practice, deluded belief that

20
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,180
this is the time to forge heartwarming memories, and the hysterical exhortations of Yuletide

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,580
end-stage capitalism combine to ensure carnage.

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,820
I understand that sometimes you may have really terrible relatives, and seeing them can actually

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,820
be an ordeal.

24
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,540
However, I have a feeling that most of the young urban socialites nowadays just view

25
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,800
their entire family with disgust for little to no reason.

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,940
This article talks about a five-point plan on making it to New Year's.

27
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,420
Okay, let's see what they've got here.

28
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,920
I'll be applying a step-by-step approach to engineering peace on Earth and goodwill to

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,420
your UKIP uncle?

30
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,100
Does... does everyone in Britain have a UKIP uncle?

31
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,660
Are they that popular now?

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,660
I do like how we've gone from racist uncle to UKIP uncle, though it's quite the stretch.

33
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:02,880
The night before Christmas, the vision, the soaring voices of boy trebles and dancing

34
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,380
candlelight illuminating the darkness, a time of magic.

35
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:12,380
The reality, the last grainy chocolate-flavored blob has been retched from its cardboard sarcophagus,

36
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,980
but no one is tucked up dreaming of sugar plums.

37
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,740
What the hell is a sugar plum, anyway?

38
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,220
They've probably been reimagined as gilded edible mini-drones for $31.99.

39
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:29,940
See, I have a feeling that this article is mostly in jest, like, they're kind of overblowing

40
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,900
the Christmas season to make it seem better or worse than it actually is.

41
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,580
You know, in a national lampoon kind of way, where that movie was all about simultaneously

42
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,260
showing the best and worst parts of Christmas with your family?

43
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:50,460
Christmas morning, the vision, an explosion of joy, the reality, an explosion of plastic,

44
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:56,100
actual children and emotion, if stocking chocolate is not swiftly removed.

45
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,860
Family fight flashpoint, ingratitude timing squabbles, my husband blithely loading a plate

46
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,800
with the expense of Christmas salmon I was saving for lunch.

47
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,140
And this is what I mean about this article being half serious, half satire, because it's

48
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,500
filled with the vision, the reality, and the point at which the family starts fighting.

49
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,100
And you know what, this article I think is ultimately not so bad, but I do know that

50
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,720
we're only scratching the surface regarding how ridiculous The Guardian gets when it comes

51
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,620
to the Christmas season.

52
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,460
Of course, this person still ultimately likes to shove in their own brand of socialism by

53
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,460
the end of the article.

54
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,380
The family are your weirdos, cherish them and add this moment to your mental album of

55
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,780
festive lies, sorry, memories.

56
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,700
And remember, thanks to the Industrial Revolution, it will all be over soon.

57
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,860
Maybe for you, but not for the rest of us.

58
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,820
However, let's visit the ghost of Guardian past and take a look at some of their older

59
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,980
Christmas articles.

60
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:52,140
Why I've gone cold turkey on Christmas consumerism While everybody else endures the stress and

61
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,700
expense of preparing for the festivities, I'm sitting back and taking it easy.

62
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,460
This year, my considerably less wholesome family of two not-so-little women and one

63
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,860
baby boy will be having Christmas without any presents.

64
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,420
Okay, hardly any presents.

65
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,500
There will be a giant river penguin for the baby, a bottle of wine and a roast chicken

66
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,080
for my partner and me, and a rawhide cigar for the dog.

67
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,800
There will be a tree and it will have decorations, old ones, there will be good and bad films,

68
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
old ones.

69
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Here's a picture around our hearth.

70
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Where's the picture?

71
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Is it this?

72
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
That's just a sprout.

73
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:30,380
There's no picture, did the picture disappear, did they just cut the picture out?

74
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,360
Is the Guardian running out of money so much that they're actually axing pictures out of

75
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
old articles?

76
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,400
But, nonetheless, there's no moral imperative to have a giant Christmas or to see every

77
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,660
single family member all the time.

78
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,260
You may remember it being that way when you were a kid, but I'm sure there were some Christmases

79
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,540
where it just didn't happen and your youngest memories start to blend together.

80
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,040
For example, this year, my girlfriend and I went back to my hometown for a couple days

81
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,860
and saw my parents, but only at the start of December.

82
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,340
We were there for like, I think it was December 2nd and December 3rd or something like that.

83
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,300
And this year, we're just hanging around the house.

84
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,700
We're not really doing anything, we're probably going to be streaming later.

85
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,500
I'm making homemade pizzas because I'm actually a pretty good cook in my opinion, but we're

86
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,260
not doing a traditional Christmas.

87
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,840
I do definitely understand the feeling that Christmas can be stressful, but I don't think

88
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:21,340
that it's just this end of time scenario that a lot of people, especially youngins on the

89
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,220
left like to consider it to be.

90
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,440
My son is now 15 months old, which means that although this isn't his first Christmas, it's

91
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,460
his first not spent breastfeeding his way through presents, lunch and my fair lady.

92
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,300
Permission to take yourself off to a corner, Nigel Farage, and cower beneath a makeshift

93
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,840
tent.

94
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,920
What is it with The Guardian and just shitting on UKIP every single article?

95
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,520
Are they honestly that afraid of the party?

96
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,520
Apparently this person's going cold turkey on Christmas consuming, or as she likes to

97
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,040
think of it, replacing shopping with living.

98
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,180
So on Black Friday, I borrowed three books for the baby from our local library.

99
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,800
On Cyber Monday, I spent nothing but some energy on feeling smug.

100
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,560
It's all taking me back to that vintage Christmas of 1988 where I took a book off my mom's shelf,

101
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,360
wrapped it and gave it right back to her.

102
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,940
She never realized and I never stopped congratulating myself.

103
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,680
It was the best of times.

104
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
Again I have to kind of agree with this article.

105
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,320
There is definitely some value in not spending thousands of fucking dollars on gifts.

106
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,640
But here's where the hatred of the holiday comes in.

107
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,720
In any case, Christmas is supposed to be cheap and nasty.

108
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,440
No matter how we try to rehash it, like that joyless stack of anally folded or rather pre-loved

109
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,720
wrapping paper that should have been loved just once and then ripped to shreds, Christmas

110
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,320
will never be cool.

111
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,420
This is why we love it and why, in these secular, straightened times, we stubbornly keep going

112
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,680
at it with tinsel on our heads and a song murdered by the X Factor in our hearts.

113
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,420
Doing Christmas on a shoestring budget isn't a lifestyle choice.

114
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,660
It's not about saving with Jamie by buying an enormous side of salmon and eating it for

115
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:01,420
a fortnight in 20 different ways until salmon and Christmas and leftovers are ruined forever.

116
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,540
Is salmon for Christmas a big thing in Britain?

117
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,740
Because it's not over here.

118
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,340
I mean, I've had salmon at Christmas before, but it's not considered a traditional dish

119
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,340
at all.

120
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,340
Over here it's definitely turkey.

121
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,320
Anyway, fine, this person thinks that Christmas is too consumeristic and doesn't want to participate.

122
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,720
But I think in missing it she misses part of the point.

123
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,320
But of course she obviously gets another part of the point.

124
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
So whatever.

125
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,020
Christmas Day is supposed to be dull.

126
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,460
Enjoy the novelty of utter boredom.

127
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,020
Let's see what this one's all about.

128
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,420
Don't catch up on the cereal.

129
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:37,040
Do as God intended and watch a war documentary with your extended family as time slows to

130
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
a crawl.

131
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:44,540
I can only wonder what kind of hellish family life you must have endured when you were a

132
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,540
kid.

133
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,960
I mean, my mom loves watching certain movies around Christmas every year.

134
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,700
She always watches The Sound of Music.

135
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,380
We always watch National Lampoon.

136
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,180
Charlie Brown usually comes on the TV once in a while.

137
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,200
There's a staple of movies and shows that just seem to be part of Christmas now, and

138
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
that's fine.

139
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:06,000
However, more recently I've noticed that on TV, on the week up to Christmas, certain

140
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,620
television stations will start playing on repeat like the entire Harry Potter series.

141
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,040
Or they'll play the Back to the Future trilogy.

142
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,480
You know, they'll just pull out these whimsical adventure stories that don't really have anything

143
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,080
to do with Christmas at all, and they'll just play them.

144
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,080
And for the past ten years or so, if I'm ever at my parents' place for Christmas, which

145
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,640
isn't much anymore, but does happen sometimes, one of those movies will be playing on TV

146
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,500
in the background while we're opening Christmas gifts on Christmas morning.

147
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:43,460
If you have a family situation where time slows to a crawl, you may need to recognize

148
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,920
that that may be unique to you.

149
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Maybe not completely unique.

150
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,440
Like I said, there's always some bad families out there, and there's always going to be

151
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,760
some people you want to avoid.

152
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,320
But to straight up say that because you have regular negative experiences that Christmas

153
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:03,360
day is supposed to be dull, I think the problem might be with you.

154
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,780
How to keep your Christmas spirit when all about you are losing theirs.

155
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,360
It's an annual conundrum, particularly as you get older and less inclined to make any

156
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,860
effort whatsoever.

157
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,800
The war on Christmas, as anyone not watching the Nativity Facts, Fictions, and Faith on

158
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Fox News at this very moment is well aware, isn't prosecuted by a loose collective of

159
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,600
socialists, atheists, and alternative religions.

160
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,920
Also you didn't say loose, you said lose.

161
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,200
And yes, I would consider these groups, with the exception of the atheists, sometimes to

162
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,800
be fucking losers.

163
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,240
No, the real war is being fought by the forces of Christmas capitalism, those which burn

164
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,320
joy out of the season with the intensity of a Star Wars lightsaber, 25% off till New Year's

165
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Day.

166
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Okay, I think there's going to be a common thread throughout all these articles, and

167
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,240
it's going to be the fact that you gotta pay for shit during Christmas and people don't

168
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,840
like that, because if you write for the Guardian, you're probably a fucking socialist.

169
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,520
The entire point of Christmas is that it's supposed to be boring.

170
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,440
You get an hour of excitement first thing and then the day devolves into an endless

171
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,440
cycle of cooking, small talk, snoring relatives, overheated rooms with no escape, and in England

172
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,320
at least, the Queen's Speech.

173
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,240
Then comes the slow, dull glide into evening, with its massive sense of anti-climax.

174
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,040
Like the worst Sunday night before school feeling, tinged with senses of loss, aging,

175
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,220
and the terrible, terrible transience of it all.

176
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,560
This is somebody who has not come to grips with their own mortality.

177
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,080
And I know it's strange to bring that up in a video about fucking Christmas, but I honestly

178
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,440
think it's the case.

179
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,080
This is somebody who is saying, when I was a kid, it was so fun, I was getting gifts

180
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,600
from my parents, there were new games and toys and everything was magical, it was great.

181
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,520
Look at her up here.

182
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,720
The most exciting element of Christmas used to be the snow beneath the tree, made of packing

183
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,600
material, which I remember thrillingly retained one's teeth marks when you bit in.

184
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,200
She's complaining now that, at least in some ways, Christmas is a holiday for children

185
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,320
and she's no longer a child.

186
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,700
And she has not been able to find a Christmas for adults that she can enjoy.

187
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,480
So she's just sitting around, being bored.

188
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,020
And complaining about the fact that she's getting old.

189
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,560
Continuing down the socialist rabbit hole, the real war on Christmas is our corporate

190
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,800
driven material culture.

191
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,680
Corporate Christmas is not a time of humble reflection, charity and modesty, it is a market

192
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,660
opportunity to be exploited.

193
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,320
Forget goodwill towards men, forget Charlie Brown, instead the commando wing of Disney's

194
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,280
media army has produced a climate warming suburban energy vampire version of dueling

195
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,280
banjos.

196
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,780
No, there's no room at the inn for something as outdated as goodwill when families go head

197
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:47,300
to head matching wits and carbon footprints in a contrived reality showdown, and the winner

198
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,520
gets money.

199
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,380
Each episode ends with $50,000 awarded to the victorious family.

200
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,520
What they're talking about is a show called The Great Christmas Light Fight, which is

201
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,440
just basically an attempt to make the most overblown Christmas light setup I have ever

202
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,620
seen in my life.

203
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,500
This is in fact worse than National Lampoon's lights.

204
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,500
The only thing that matches ABC's too close to the bone expression of a corporately sponsored

205
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,560
Christmas is America's annual Black Friday devilish and derby, and the desperate consumerism

206
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,980
that fuels it.

207
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,940
All videos of the violent scrum have become a tradition too, with each passing year the

208
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,260
kickoff to the profitable holiday season looks more and more like a kickoff to a football

209
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,040
game as retailers keep their stores open and their minds closed to anything other than

210
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,660
squeezing a little more profit out of embattled consumers.

211
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,740
I could say that this is a problem with American culture because if there's one thing that

212
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:40,260
Americans are known for overseas, and even in Canada, which is obviously a foreign nation

213
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,900
member, it's not overseas, it's not even American militarism, though that's pretty

214
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,380
high up there, it's American overconsumption.

215
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,620
So there's definitely a statement to be made about American overconsumption.

216
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,540
If you look at Suda51's games, like Killer7 or No More Heroes or whatever, those games

217
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,580
are basically all about American overconsumption, that would be the thematic element of those

218
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,580
games.

219
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:07,500
So there's definitely this idea overseas that American culture is basically the stereotypical

220
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,140
fat guy in a hover around eating McDonalds.

221
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,620
But there's something else to talk about here that's not just overconsumption, it's competition.

222
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:21,180
You look at the great Christmas light fight, it's not just the fact that they're creating

223
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,940
these monstrosities, it's the fact that they're competing.

224
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,300
And you look at stores in Black Friday, yes there are crowds who are clamoring to get

225
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,100
a hold of something, but they describe it as a kickoff.

226
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,140
And if you read the rest of the article and you kind of look at some of the language they

227
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:40,460
use, like they talk about the Alamo, they talk about Christmas soldiers and etc.

228
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:45,340
It really does seem that a lot of the problem that this person has with it is that, not

229
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,680
that it's over-consumeristic, although it is, it's that it's competitive.

230
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:57,040
And I'm not surprised at all that a socialist would be anti-competitive, because competition

231
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,760
is inherently capitalist.

232
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:05,640
The fact that maybe there are a group of people, all with varying levels of skill and experience,

233
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,680
competing to try and come out on top, and that there are winners and losers, and that

234
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,920
the spoils of the competition go disproportionately to the winners because they have won.

235
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,480
I can see exactly why a socialist would find that offensive.

236
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,880
So variety at Christmas is a challenge, but it's better than the alternative.

237
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,540
I'm somebody who doesn't drink, ever.

238
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,260
I haven't had a drop of alcohol in about five years.

239
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,780
I haven't been drunk in about ten.

240
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,800
And I'm not about to start now, I have no desire to drink at all.

241
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,500
So maybe I'm not going to be able to understand this article as well as the previous ones.

242
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,020
I could kind of read into the subtext of the previous ones, maybe not so much this one.

243
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,260
I remember clearly, indeed it's one of the few things I do remember, this counselor turning

244
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,540
to me and asking if I had drunk enough.

245
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,960
I must have been in my mid-twenties at the time and I couldn't quite grasp what he meant.

246
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,640
At best I found his tone flippant, antagonistic even.

247
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,740
It would be another fifteen years before I fully understood what a pertinent question

248
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,740
he'd raised.

249
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:07,680
This is something I've noticed, I've known a few alcoholics in my life, and if you ever

250
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,960
ask them, you know, have you drunk enough, they will get extremely defensive.

251
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,140
If you're talking to a non-alcoholic who's drinking and you ask them have you had enough,

252
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,560
they'll say yes or they'll say no, depending on what the answer is.

253
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,200
But if you ask an alcoholic that question, they take it as a personal slight.

254
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,680
And so it's Christmas again, and do you know something, this would be my third Christmas

255
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,680
sober.

256
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,880
And when I say sober, I mean sober, not a dry drunk, my tongue hanging out and desperate.

257
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,760
In other words, I did eventually drink enough.

258
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,520
And I was sitting here quietly the other night when a wave of joy washed over me.

259
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,440
I don't crave alcohol.

260
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,360
Not that this was an epiphany, but at this time of year, what a powerful reminder of

261
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,000
just how lucky I am.

262
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,720
I'm going to assume that this is written by an alcoholic who has given up drinking and

263
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,680
now he has progressed to the point where he no longer feels the urge to drink anymore.

264
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,600
And if that's the case, you know, congratulations, it's tough to get out of, man.

265
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
You know what?

266
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,240
I completely understand my relatively unique point of view on this topic, but this is actually

267
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,400
a very reasonable article.

268
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,600
It's just basically about a former alcoholic, and I'm genuinely proud of what this person's

269
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
accomplished.

270
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,400
However, in Guardian fashion, they did write the headline as if it's another one of those

271
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,460
I hate my family articles.

272
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,380
And speaking of hating your family, Christmas is ruined by children.

273
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:35,120
Our overindulgent society has turned children into greedy little emperors.

274
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,440
Thanks Santa, I can look forward to a Christmas with adults.

275
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,140
Children ruin Christmas.

276
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,260
I know this because I've done it myself.

277
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:47,020
As a small boy growing up in the early 1970s, I had my heart set on an astronaut outfit.

278
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,300
Turns out my mother had left it too late and all she could find in the toy shop, space

279
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,940
man wise, was the helmet.

280
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:57,380
The fury of a disappointed, petulant child knows no bounds and I screamed, then cried,

281
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,660
then threw the helmet across the room and made my family's Christmas utterly miserable.

282
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,380
My parents were on eggshells for the rest of the day.

283
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,420
My sisters opened their presents in embarrassed silence.

284
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,860
Even the dog looked depressed.

285
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,900
It sounds like you might have been a terrible child.

286
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,620
Alternatively, it also sounds like you could have just had one of those days that children

287
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,620
have.

288
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,740
It doesn't excuse it, but every kid has a day where they act like little shit.

289
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,900
It doesn't make them a bad person.

290
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,980
I can remember days when I acted like that, and as an adult, thinking back, I am embarrassed

291
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,820
of them now, but it is something that every kid goes through and it's the parents responsibility

292
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,360
to teach them why they can't do that.

293
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,160
The traditional, and let's face it, slightly sickening Christmas image of the whole family

294
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,040
joyously opening presents around a real tree, grateful for the gifts they receive, is woefully

295
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,040
outdated if it ever existed in the first place.

296
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,500
The reality of the modern Christmas nightmare is more like this.

297
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,720
You bought the wrong Xbox game for your 10 year old son, and the trainers you bought

298
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,200
for your daughter, the apple of your eye.

299
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,820
Why isn't your son the apple of your eye?

300
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,820
Why not both of them?

301
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,200
Are you actually playing favorites here?

302
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,240
Were fashionable last year.

303
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,860
That's why they were so heavily discounted, but you do like a bargain.

304
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,460
As for the mobile phones you thoughtfully got for them despite their tender years because

305
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,140
everyone else in their class has one, don't even go there.

306
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,080
Your delightful progeny are now weeping with rage at your ineptitude and hate you for ruining

307
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,260
their day.

308
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,140
You don't know anything about anything.

309
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,700
You are an idiot.

310
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,700
If this is happening every single Christmas, not just once in a while because, you know,

311
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,500
kids sometimes throw tantrums for bad reasons, even the best ones, or there might even be

312
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:44,500
a problem with your kid mentally or psychologically, but if not any of those reasons, if this happens

313
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,140
every single Christmas, that means you probably suck at disciplining your children.

314
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,020
On the one hand, I hate the mentality that you should always be thankful for the things

315
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,860
that you're given because if someone just hands you a pile of garbage, you're not going

316
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,340
to say thank you for this garbage.

317
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,700
However, on the other hand, if someone has made a good faith attempt at trying to brighten

318
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,580
your day and then they fail at it, you should still be thankful for the attempt and it's

319
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,660
important to teach your kids that too.

320
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,520
If you haven't taught them that, you've failed as a parent.

321
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,220
The idea that parents these days are time poor and overcompensate for this by indulging

322
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,540
their offspring is so familiar as to have become a cliche, but it's true.

323
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,060
We seem to be hell bent on creating our own versions of China's little emperors and all

324
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,740
this over pampering and overindulgence means that children aren't able to cope with not

325
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,740
getting what they want.

326
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,940
Yeah, that's true, isn't it?

327
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,560
Maybe you should have done something about that.

328
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,860
Maybe you should have adjusted how you raised your children.

329
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,800
Maybe you should have done it before they all moved off to university and started shitting

330
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,900
up the rest of society with their snowflake bullshit.

331
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,980
Why I'm opting out of Christmas.

332
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,420
Is it because you're a cat lady?

333
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,040
We have ruined Christmas by allowing capitalism to tell us we should be buying ourselves into

334
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,300
an orgy of goodwill and glamour.

335
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,900
An orgy of goodwill!

336
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:01,280
There's few things in the world that sound better than, say, an orgy of goodwill.

337
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,660
Being under house arrest with a group of disharmonious, sherry-heavy relatives slow-roasting in front

338
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,300
of a flickering television with nothing to look forward to but a ten-minute montage of

339
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,140
royalist propaganda isn't great.

340
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,520
I once spent Christmas morning hiding in a coal shed with a bottle of Morrison's Cava

341
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,380
and a packet of my grandmother's cigarettes, planning how to make my escape to freedom.

342
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,660
Aged 14, I was left to cook dinner while my mother locked herself in the bathroom and

343
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,380
a giant dog defecated on the lawn.

344
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,100
Yeah, see, sometimes you have shitty families.

345
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,100
Sometimes you are the shitty person in the family.

346
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,180
Sometimes it's both.

347
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,180
Maybe here it's both.

348
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,280
Christmas is the stick with which millions of us beat ourselves into brandy-soaked agony

349
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,320
for being poor, single, childless, lonely, or simply bad at being jolly.

350
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,820
You don't have to have all of those markers to have a good life.

351
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,380
You probably need some of them.

352
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,100
You know, there are certainly some universals that humans need, you know?

353
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,540
You need a way to provide for yourself.

354
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,620
You need something useful to spend your time on outside of work.

355
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,620
You need a relationship.

356
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,620
You need a family.

357
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,620
You need kids.

358
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,660
You don't need all of these things, but you need some of them.

359
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,620
If you don't have at least some of them, you're probably going to have a terrible life.

360
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:11,460
And the problem isn't just to scream at society or scream at Christmas every time it comes

361
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,460
around.

362
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,200
Maybe you should examine your life and figure out why you hate it when other people have

363
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,200
so much fun.

364
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,180
But here's the person's solution.

365
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,380
Stop giving presents.

366
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,860
Stop watching television.

367
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,820
Stop comparing yourself to advertisements.

368
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,680
And actually spend it with people you like.

369
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,180
This year, however, I am opting out altogether.

370
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,060
I shan't be driving home for Christmas.

371
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,580
I have no tree, have wrapped no presents, will eat no turkey, and mull no wine.

372
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,880
Instead, I shall go for a run, listen to the headlines, eat a baked potato, and watch a

373
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,380
Western with my mother.

374
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,300
On Christmas Eve, I plan to volunteer at the Hackney Care Leavers Christmas dinner, but

375
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,980
the day itself is as blank as a fresh fall of snow.

376
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,980
I can't wait.

377
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,980
And that's fine.

378
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,780
You can spend Christmas or any other day however you like.

379
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,380
But it doesn't need to be a fucking Guardian article.

380
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,980
You don't need to tell everybody how you've discovered the true way to spend Christmas

381
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,780
happy, not doing Christmas at all.

382
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,380
Maybe you should just do the things that you like to do and allow other people to do the

383
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,620
things that they like to do unmolested.

384
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:11,420
And if you find yourself either not having fun doing the things that you thought you

385
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,860
liked, or alternatively looking at people who are doing something more traditional and

386
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,460
having an irrational rage towards them, then maybe you need to examine your own life.

387
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,260
Warning, your festive meal could be more damaging than a long-haul flight.

388
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,500
This is going to be like a vegan article, isn't it?

389
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,520
Eating certain meats is about the worst thing you can do to the planet, yeah, yeah, vegan.

390
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,100
A kilogram of beef protein reared on a British Hill farm can generate the equivalent of 643

391
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,380
kilograms of carbon dioxide.

392
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,460
A kilogram of lamb protein produced in the same place can generate 749 kilograms.

393
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,460
One kilo of protein from either source, in other words, causes more greenhouse gas emissions

394
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,800
than a passenger flying from London to New York.

395
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,260
The figures are so high because modern animal husbandry is so unproductive.

396
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,260
To produce one lamb, you need to keep a large area of land bare and fertilized.

397
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,880
The animal must roam the hills to find its food, burning more fat and producing more

398
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,440
methane than a stalled beast would.

399
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,400
Environmentalism is probably the only place that I side consistently more with the left

400
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:13,220
than the right than any other part of politics, just because there's some undeniable truth

401
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,320
regarding humanity's impact on the environment.

402
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,680
The idea that global warming, for example, or climate change is just a Chinese myth,

403
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,760
as Trump described it, is completely stupid.

404
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,680
Very clearly we have an impact on the environment.

405
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,200
Very clearly the things that we do impact the situation that we find ourselves in.

406
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,400
We are not somehow separate from the rest of the world and we're not special in that

407
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
regard.

408
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:43,340
At the same time, this entire article has been about the various costs of raising animals

409
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,340
certain ways.

410
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,060
And it has yet to come into Christmas, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be something

411
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:51,220
along the lines of, if you eat a big turkey dinner or something, then you are destroying

412
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,220
the planet.

413
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,640
As we approach the end of the ride, there's a few crazy ones right here.

414
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,540
Sweden makes my gender-free toy Christmas wish come true.

415
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,320
With a picture of a girl with a Nerf gun, a Swedish toy retailer is arming children

416
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,640
with the ability to question outdated gender roles.

417
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,000
Well guess what, miss not progressive enough?

418
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,160
Swedish toy retailers are also training women to become active shooters.

419
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,700
All I want for Christmas is an end to the mandatory gendering of every children's toy.

420
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,560
They're not gendered.

421
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,960
There might be a boy or a girl on the box, and I'm sure that's fucking traumatizing for

422
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,560
you, but you know what, if your little girl wants a Nerf gun, buy her the Nerf gun.

423
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,920
If your little boy wants a doll, you can always buy him the doll.

424
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,760
It's kind of like the pink tax bullshit.

425
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:42,020
If the men and women's products are the same fucking thing, but the women's costs more,

426
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,020
just buy the men's.

427
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,100
What does it matter?

428
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,240
The amazing thing is that gender roles for children have become so calcified that such

429
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,860
petty things can be presented as radical.

430
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,540
Sample headline from the Daily Mail, Dolls?

431
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,840
They're not just for girls.

432
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,340
Which of course relies on the voice of your inner UKIP voter shouting, yes, dolls are

433
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,340
just for girls.

434
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,700
Okay, we should probably have had like a UKIP counter in this video, because how many times

435
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,620
has UKIP been scapegoated so far?

436
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,620
Five times?

437
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,820
A lot of people will try to tell you that boys just don't like playing with dolls.

438
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,840
Coincidentally, these same people also tell any boys in their vicinity that boys don't

439
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,460
play with dolls.

440
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:22,940
It's not an innate sexual difference that makes girls and boys play either side of the

441
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,900
pink-blue divide, it's adults constantly impressing on their charges that one group of toys is

442
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,940
right and the other is wrong.

443
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,100
I remember having a doll house in fact, and I asked my mom, I was maybe five years old

444
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,060
or something at the time, you know, I was in fact the woke child everyone talks about

445
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,060
on Twitter.

446
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:45,420
I asked my mom, hey, um, is it all right that I, if I play with a doll house, even though

447
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,420
I'm a boy?

448
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,060
And my mom said, well, it doesn't matter, you know, play with it, play with whatever

449
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,060
you want.

450
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,060
If you're having fun, what does it matter?

451
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,060
And I said, yeah, it didn't matter.

452
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,060
And you know what?

453
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:58,540
Um, at the time I was seven or eight, I had naturally grown out of playing with dolls

454
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,540
and doll houses.

455
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,780
And if I hadn't grown out of playing with dolls and doll houses, it would have been

456
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,780
fine as well.

457
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:09,220
And I think there definitely is a biological divide here, at least on some level, you know,

458
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,780
it's no secret that, you know, on average, and we're talking like a very large average

459
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,660
because we're talking about 50% of the entire human population.

460
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,180
So it's not at all going to be consistent all the time.

461
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:25,300
But on average, boys prefer things and girls prefer people.

462
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:31,100
So boys generally enjoy, you know, like, uh, children's tool sets or cars or whatever.

463
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,780
And girls generally enjoy dolls and doll houses.

464
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:40,020
And if you happen to have a boy or a girl that likes both or only likes the other gender's

465
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,300
toys, that's fine too.

466
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,300
It's not a big deal.

467
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,340
I don't think it's something that needs correction through social engineering.

468
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,500
I was determined to give my first child a beginning free from gender dogma.

469
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:55,460
So it was both brilliant and slightly blindsiding when aged three, his Christmas list led off

470
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,940
with a baby and a buggy.

471
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,740
Okay, well, I mean, good for him.

472
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,620
He wanted a toy baby and he wanted a toy buggy to push him around in.

473
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,620
That's fine.

474
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,380
But the pink pox couldn't be kept out forever.

475
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:10,780
It seemed to arrive in the space of a single week, a preschool room full of stripey t-shirts

476
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,300
and denim half erupting in tiaras and princess dresses.

477
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,300
Us parents had enjoyed a good run, but our children had finally twigged that greater

478
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,820
forces wanted them to conform to a certain pair of types.

479
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,900
At first, my reaction to this was one of cynical resignation.

480
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,500
Of course, we couldn't win against the masked forces of Disney and Mattel.

481
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,060
Why had we even tried?

482
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,860
Maybe it wasn't Disney and Mattel.

483
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:37,340
Maybe it was because as children go from three to five and then from five to eight and then

484
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:44,380
from eight to the teenage years, certain forces as they grow up, including but not limited

485
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:49,420
to puberty, start to make boys and girls act a little bit different from each other.

486
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:54,000
And moreover, if they're enjoying themselves, if once they've kind of gone through their

487
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,800
split and now they're happy being whatever gender they are, if they're happy, what does

488
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
it matter?

489
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:05,320
The Christmas shutdown just makes us drunker, fatter, lazier, and lonelier.

490
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:12,080
Buddy, this picture shows you to probably be drunker, fatter, lazier, and lonelier,

491
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,880
and you're looking for something to blame it on?

492
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,880
I guess there was a rail shutdown in 2014 in the UK.

493
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,660
During Christmas, no public transport moves.

494
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:27,620
To get from A to Z without a private car and overpriced taxi is impossible.

495
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:33,240
This is your complaint, that the buses don't run on Christmas Day.

496
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Is that it?

497
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,180
When aircraft touch down at, say, Heathrow, their passengers find themselves marooned.

498
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:44,340
The country beyond the airport is impenetrable unless they can afford its inflated cab fares.

499
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:50,300
It lies there, hushed and immobile, smelling faintly of roasts, quite unlike anywhere else.

500
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,380
This is really where you're going with this, isn't it?

501
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,500
You can't catch the bus.

502
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,860
You can't catch the bus on the 25th.

503
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,660
So it's a big fucking problem.

504
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,540
This article is mainly just a big fat complaint.

505
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,380
It's not really worth going into.

506
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:09,140
But why does the end of it have something about Nigel Farage's coat?

507
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,500
It's not like it's a new article.

508
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,100
It still has the end of, it just has an excerpt.

509
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,820
Even reading it, it's an excerpt from a different article.

510
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,820
Did something fuck up?

511
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,820
Sometimes on some websites, if you scroll down long enough, the article changes, right?

512
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,980
You'll even see the URL change.

513
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,660
But this time, it doesn't happen at all.

514
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:34,460
They just tacked on the end of a different article into this one.

515
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,940
Here's another angry soy boy.

516
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,120
It's time for a real war on Christmas.

517
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,260
This is definitely not the most wonderful time of the year.

518
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:47,780
I'm not surprised that even in 2014, you were a fucking NPC, buddy.

519
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,180
Let's cancel Christmas.

520
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,180
No.

521
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,260
I understand that this is last minute, and some of you may have already started ordering

522
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,940
presents for family and loved ones on Amazon, bought airplane tickets, or planned a menu

523
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,940
for the big family meal.

524
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,940
But hear me out.

525
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,020
I think we will be better off, all of us as individuals, everyone together, society, the

526
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,200
world, if we stop celebrating this holiday.

527
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,740
In truth, I think we'd be better off if we stopped celebrating all holidays.

528
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,380
Holidays are stupid.

529
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,920
Everything must be equalized.

530
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,180
Everything must be the same.

531
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:21,500
The entire world must be a globe of tasteless, valueless, grey paste.

532
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,380
Differences are oppressive.

533
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,580
Value hierarchies do not exist.

534
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,300
Holiday cheer must be equally redistributed to all days.

535
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,300
It's miserable.

536
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,380
It's cold.

537
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,500
Everybody's getting sick.

538
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,940
All the plants are dead.

539
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:38,260
There's too much stuff to do before the calendar year ends anyway, and it gets dark right after

540
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,260
lunch.

541
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:43,600
And because you have such a terrible time, everyone else must be miserable as well.

542
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,840
We have to all be equal in our misery.

543
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,000
Holidays, especially Christmas, make people sad.

544
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,780
They make you sad if you have resigned yourself to being sad.

545
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:57,360
You can be affected by tragedies in life sometimes, but if you let them rule your life to the

546
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,080
point that years later they're destroying holidays for you, you have a serious problem

547
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,040
and the problem is not with the holiday.

548
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,360
You've surely read about the seasonal spike in suicide statistics.

549
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,440
It turns out that spike is apocryphal, but its persistence as a trope is instructive.

550
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,960
Well, no it's not.

551
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,720
If it's not fucking true, it's not fucking true.

552
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,860
Christmas and every other holiday simply marks a date on a calendar.

553
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,720
An arbitrary point in time.

554
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,360
Especially when you take into consideration the fluctuations in the rotation of the Earth

555
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,360
and the lunar cycle.

556
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,360
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

557
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,880
This is something that I see a lot of lefties do, especially a lot of socialists.

558
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,720
You see like Neil deGrasse Tyson talking about the new year is just an arbitrary day that

559
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,120
doesn't really mean much.

560
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:41,320
In fact, I guarantee you, check Twitter, January 1st, he's gonna have said something about

561
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,320
that.

562
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,600
He talks about how borders are just arbitrary lines that humans draw and have no real basis

563
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,600
in reality.

564
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,680
While at the same time, of course, having a wall around his house.

565
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,920
The point is, is that when you get into the radical left, they believe that all human

566
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,380
made distinctions are inherently meaningless and that if there is a value structure set

567
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,840
up around them, it is inherently corrupt.

568
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,760
That's why you have open borders activists, that's why you have people hating on holidays,

569
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,200
that's why they hate corporate culture or frankly entrepreneurs or anybody who, you

570
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,480
know, works hard or likes capitalism because capitalism itself is generally a hierarchy

571
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,440
of competence and so they just want the bare fucking minimum of everything and they want

572
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,960
everybody to only have the bare minimum so that everything can be equal.

573
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,400
They'd rather people be equal than be free and in fact, you can see it right here.

574
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,960
The best advice I've ever gotten, the surest path to happiness that I know is this, don't

575
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,920
expect, don't expect anything ever.

576
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,960
The less we expect, the happier we are.

577
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,020
Expectation is the worst.

578
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:46,520
It leads directly to disappointment, consistently, reliably, expectation produces misery.

579
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:53,340
This person would rather have a safe, okay life living in squalor and having everybody

580
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,760
else living in squalor with him so that he doesn't have to feel bad about being there

581
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,680
than to take a chance, give it a go, endure the ups and downs of life and try to make

582
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,000
something of yourself.

583
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,380
And now we come to the absolute bottom of the barrel.

584
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,500
No I will not wrap all the presents.

585
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,900
Why are women still responsible for the holiday joy?

586
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,460
Hello Jessica Valenti.

587
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,740
Someday I will do a dissecting a degenerate on Jessica Valenti because she is absolutely

588
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,740
ridiculous.

589
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,060
The holidays bring another set of gendered expectations.

590
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:28,220
This season should be all fun and family, not enduring more chores and consumerism.

591
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,060
I love everything about the holiday season.

592
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:34,140
I like the brisk weather, the festive wreaths, you've even decorated a tree already taught

593
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,420
with a cardboard glitter star that I made with my daughter when she was two years old.

594
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,900
It's the happiest season of all.

595
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:43,300
Maybe you should be redistributing all of that holiday cheer to the other days evenly,

596
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,000
like the previous article said if you want to be a good leftist.

597
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,420
We all know that women do the majority of domestic work like childcare, housework and

598
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,920
cooking, but the holidays bring on a whole new set of gendered expectations that make

599
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,620
the season less about simply enjoying fun and family and more about enduring consumerism,

600
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,120
chores and resentment.

601
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,060
If a present doesn't get somewhere on time, if at all, if the cookies for the school's

602
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:07,900
holiday bake-off are store-bought, or your family holiday cards arrive just shy of February,

603
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,100
it's not men who get looked at askance.

604
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,480
After decades of feminist progress, women are still considered primarily responsible

605
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,380
for an entire family's holiday joy.

606
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:19,540
I'm sorry that you live in this kind of relationship or this kind of family dynamic, but my girlfriend

607
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,300
and I take the holiday joy equally.

608
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,780
We wrap gifts together, we make meals together, and we spend time together.

609
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,680
What is it with all of these fucking people just wanting to hate something that other

610
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,760
people enjoy?

611
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,220
So please, as the women in your lives work their fingers to the point of bringing you

612
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,780
holiday cheer, get up and lend a hand.

613
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,980
Santa's not the only one who keeps a list of who's naughty and nice.

614
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,140
Oh god, this whole fucking thing is just stupid.

615
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:49,120
Like she's saying, I want help, and you know what, that's fine, you should be getting help.

616
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,040
Everyone should be given some help, especially when the chores start to rack up, not even

617
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,500
in a Christmas sense.

618
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,780
Like if the house is dirty, you should both be cleaning it.

619
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,660
And if one person has more time at home than the other, then the one person should probably

620
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,660
be cleaning it more.

621
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,180
But that shouldn't be a gendered thing, it should be a responsibility thing.

622
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,940
But look at how she titles it, I will not wrap all the presents.

623
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,980
Why am I responsible for joy?

624
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:16,020
How about everyone's responsible for joy, Jessica, including you?

625
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:20,380
How about the solution is to not act like a petulant fucking child who didn't get what

626
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,780
they wanted for Christmas?

627
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:26,640
Well this has been an enjoyable Guardian Christmas, I am sure that these people are absolutely

628
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,800
fucking insane, but you know what, it made for a good video, and I absolutely loved spending

629
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,300
the day with you guys.

630
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,980
And I'm going to continue to do so, because tonight I plan to do an extra long Christmas

631
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:42,980
stream of Yakuza Kiwami, which is a game that takes place during Christmas, so it's appropriately

632
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,980
festive.

633
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,380
My girlfriend and I will be happy to spend Christmas with you guys over at twitch.tv

634
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,900
slash Game Boomers.

635
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,440
Merry Christmas everybody, I hope you all enjoyed your holiday, and I will leave you

636
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,040
with a story told to me by somebody who's very active in my Discord, he's a very prominent

637
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,920
member of the community, he's the guy who wrote the Sargon's Tea poem for D&D, so he

638
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,760
definitely likes spinning a good yarn, and this one is all about Christmas.

639
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,700
Catch you guys later, I love you.

640
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:15,060
When I was in kindergarten, my dad thought it'd be a good idea to take me hunting on

641
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,060
a Sunday.

642
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,840
It's a foggy day, we're not seeing much, and then all of a sudden we see a deer.

643
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,680
My dad blasted it, all exciting shit, and it ran off.

644
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:31,600
He almost trips over the deer because it's so foggy, and then he notices it, he runs

645
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:37,680
back to the truck, grabs me by the shoulders, saying, we got Bambi, we got Bambi.
