00:00.000 --> 00:09.740
As you probably know, I generally don't talk about celebrities on this channel.

00:09.740 --> 00:14.460
I dipped my toes into that nightmarish mess last year with Sam Smith's decline from

00:14.460 --> 00:18.900
British pretty boy to swelled-up homunculus, and the year before with Demi Lovato deciding

00:18.900 --> 00:22.760
to come out as non-binary as an attempt to revive her floundering career.

00:22.760 --> 00:24.000
She walked it back, by the way.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
That was always just her trying to grasp for relevance.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.120
Hollywood is cancerous.

00:28.120 --> 00:32.080
I genuinely hate it, and I haven't paid attention to the latest actors or musicians

00:32.080 --> 00:34.120
or whatever in decades now.

00:34.120 --> 00:37.240
Even back in high school, when my peers were all over celebrity gossip, I just didn't

00:37.240 --> 00:38.240
care.

00:38.240 --> 00:39.240
I was too busy playing video games.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.160
And it's just as well, because Hollywood seems to be on its last legs.

00:42.160 --> 00:46.020
Coronavirus was the death knell for theaters, and they still really haven't seen a revival.

00:46.020 --> 00:48.600
Nobody cares about watching new movies or TV shows anymore.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.280
Mainstream music is all garbage.

00:50.280 --> 00:53.160
The celebrities themselves are all preachy pieces of shit.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.760
Like remember when they all came out to sing John Lennon's Imagine?

00:55.760 --> 00:59.080
It's come to the point that whenever I see a TikTok collage of celebs talking to the

00:59.080 --> 01:02.860
camera, I legitimately want to just do the opposite of whatever they're saying.

01:02.860 --> 01:07.400
The first time I'd ever even heard of Lizzo as an unplugged anti-normie was this article

01:07.400 --> 01:12.240
back during the George Floyd protests, where Lizzo along with other celebs joined the chorus

01:12.240 --> 01:15.040
of people calling for defunding the police.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.740
Remember in the last video, when I made the claim that the upper class calls for progressive

01:17.740 --> 01:21.240
policies that they won't have to bear the burden of because it makes them seem more

01:21.240 --> 01:22.920
morally righteous to their peers?

01:22.920 --> 01:24.880
Yeah, this is pretty much what I'm talking about.

01:24.880 --> 01:28.360
It's not the gated communities in Hollywood that Lizzo and the other celebs live in that

01:28.360 --> 01:32.540
experience anarchy when the police pull back from an Antifa riot, and they have more than

01:32.540 --> 01:35.280
enough wealth to afford private security when necessary.

01:35.280 --> 01:38.320
They will never feel the negative effects of defunding the police, which is why they

01:38.320 --> 01:40.000
can call for it so openly.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.360
But what I really remember Lizzo for, and probably the same with you guys, was the whole

01:43.360 --> 01:45.520
crystal flute thing from back in 2022.

01:45.520 --> 01:46.880
Does that ring a bell?

01:46.880 --> 01:47.880
Here's the story.

01:47.880 --> 01:52.080
During the War of 1812, when the British burned down the White House, Dolly Madison, the wife

01:52.080 --> 01:56.540
of President James Madison, managed to save some historical artifacts during her escape.

01:56.540 --> 02:00.840
The most famous one was a portrait of George Washington, but among the artifacts was James

02:00.840 --> 02:02.080
Madison's crystal flute.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.840
Claude Laurent, or is it Lorraine?

02:03.840 --> 02:09.280
A French watchmaker and mechanic, invented the process to create glass flutes in 1806.

02:09.280 --> 02:13.040
This was an important innovation as temperature change altered the sound of the commonly available

02:13.040 --> 02:15.140
wood and ivory flutes at the time.

02:15.140 --> 02:18.980
Many of his flutes are glass flutes, but he did use the same process to make significantly

02:18.980 --> 02:21.760
rarer and more ornate crystal flutes.

02:21.760 --> 02:25.640
He gifted one of the crystal flutes to President Madison to commemorate his second presidential

02:25.640 --> 02:26.640
inauguration.

02:26.640 --> 02:31.320
The flute passed from the Madison's to Dolly's son from her first marriage, a man named John

02:31.320 --> 02:32.440
Payne Todd.

02:32.440 --> 02:36.000
Todd was known as a gambler and a drinker, and upon his death, the flute passed to his

02:36.000 --> 02:37.640
doctor, Cornelius Boyle.

02:37.640 --> 02:41.400
It's not confirmed, but it's pretty obvious that Todd made this decision to cover his

02:41.400 --> 02:42.480
medical debts.

02:42.480 --> 02:46.180
The flute stayed in Dr. Boyle's family until it was shown off at the United States National

02:46.180 --> 02:47.740
Museum in 1903.

02:47.740 --> 02:51.780
The Boyle family sold it to Dayton C. Miller, a flute collector and physicist, who gifted

02:51.780 --> 02:57.100
his entire collection of 1,700 flutes to the Library of Congress in 1941.

02:57.100 --> 03:01.220
We don't know if the flute had ever actually been played during all the times it changed

03:01.220 --> 03:02.220
hands.

03:02.220 --> 03:05.900
I'm sure somebody picked it up and blew into it once or twice in private, but since 1941,

03:05.900 --> 03:11.120
the flute is confirmed to never have been played until Lizzo picked it up in 2022.

03:11.120 --> 03:14.820
Lizzo is not just a pop singer but also an accomplished flutist, and when she visited

03:14.820 --> 03:18.340
the Library of Congress, she requested to play Madison's flute.

03:18.340 --> 03:21.940
After negotiating with the library staff and Capitol Police, they allowed her to handle

03:21.940 --> 03:40.400
the flute under their watch.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.720
Her performance with the flute was actually pretty good, no real complaints here, at least

03:43.720 --> 03:50.480
until she twerked with it.

03:50.480 --> 03:54.200
It was at this point that the story became part of the culture war news cycle back in

03:54.200 --> 03:55.640
2022.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.920
Conservatives were in an uproar about the defiling of a priceless American artifact

03:58.920 --> 04:02.980
while progressives were declaring it a triumph of how far black women had come.

04:02.980 --> 04:07.400
After the event, Lizzo asked the library if she could borrow the flute for her Washington

04:07.400 --> 04:08.400
concert.

04:08.400 --> 04:12.000
They agreed, though they sent the flute to and from the venue under constant guard by

04:12.000 --> 04:13.280
Capitol Police.

04:13.280 --> 04:17.560
This is when the infamous viral clip took place of Lizzo twerking with the flute dressed

04:17.560 --> 04:33.200
up in her gaudy stage attire.

05:03.200 --> 05:21.600
Yes, this means this is actually the second time Lizzo twerked with the flute, the first

05:21.600 --> 05:24.120
impromptu at the Library of Congress, the second on stage.

05:24.120 --> 05:27.440
Now personally, I don't give a shit about the crystal flute, and honestly, I am hard

05:27.440 --> 05:30.600
pressed to believe that your average American conservative gave a shit about it before this

05:30.600 --> 05:32.040
event even took place.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.000
There are certain American artifacts that patriots hold dear.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.440
The Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the first American flag, the Liberty Bell, Mount

05:38.440 --> 05:42.800
Rushmore, and the Statue of Liberty, if we expand to things large enough to also be locations.

05:42.800 --> 05:47.240
These are all artifacts known the world over as being quintessentially American.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.720
But James Madison's flute?

05:48.720 --> 05:52.200
I've never even heard an American mention it before Lizzo twerked with it.

05:52.200 --> 05:56.100
Nonetheless, conservatives declared this to be a grave insult to America when this story

05:56.100 --> 05:57.100
went viral.

05:57.100 --> 06:01.940
That it was a defilement of a priceless artifact of Americana by an avatar of modernism dragging

06:01.940 --> 06:04.660
a sanctified symbol down to the level of the mundane.

06:04.660 --> 06:09.300
A common view of modernism by conservatives is that both the rejection of spirituality

06:09.300 --> 06:13.900
and the drive to make everything equal leads to the desire to deliberately profane anything

06:13.900 --> 06:17.060
considered sacred, that the high must be brought low.

06:17.060 --> 06:18.800
And there's at least some truth to this.

06:18.800 --> 06:22.020
While we don't know if Lizzo was actually the first person to play Madison's crystal

06:22.020 --> 06:25.660
flute, she probably wasn't in fact, when she stated on stage that nobody's ever played

06:25.660 --> 06:28.940
it before and that she was going to do it, that's the modernist impulse she's referring

06:28.940 --> 06:30.620
to, at least on a subconscious level.

06:30.620 --> 06:31.620
And that makes sense.

06:31.620 --> 06:32.620
Think about it.

06:32.620 --> 06:35.660
If I gave you a historical flute and I told you it had never been played by anybody before,

06:35.660 --> 06:38.220
once it's in your hands, you'd probably feel an urge to play it.

06:38.220 --> 06:41.420
That intrinsic human impulse to be a little chaotic, break a rule, mess with things a

06:41.420 --> 06:44.900
bit, along with the possibility of doing something that nobody's ever done before, that's all

06:44.900 --> 06:45.900
very understandable.

06:45.900 --> 06:49.860
Meanwhile, the people who care about such things would probably feel very strongly that

06:49.860 --> 06:54.020
the continuity of nobody's ever played this flute before should be preserved.

06:54.020 --> 06:57.820
It's very easy to put yourself in the shoes of either person and see why they want what

06:57.820 --> 06:58.820
they want.

06:58.820 --> 06:59.820
And here's the thing.

06:59.820 --> 07:03.660
The response to this conservative outcry by people on the extreme left kind of shows my

07:03.660 --> 07:05.420
analysis of this to be correct.

07:05.420 --> 07:10.200
For example, look at Jezebel's article, conservatives very offended by Lizzo twerking with slave

07:10.200 --> 07:11.540
owners' crystal flute.

07:11.540 --> 07:15.700
Lizzo played the antique instrument on stage for a brief solo, being the first person to

07:15.700 --> 07:19.780
ever do so, liberating it from its vault at the Library of Congress, where it's been stored

07:19.780 --> 07:21.700
for the better part of two centuries.

07:21.700 --> 07:25.900
Let's just take a moment to remind ourselves that Madison owned more than 100 slaves and

07:25.900 --> 07:30.300
originated the three-fifths compromise that refused to recognize black Americans as whole

07:30.300 --> 07:31.300
people.

07:31.300 --> 07:34.740
Lizzo does not owe him the respect of wearing pants to play his instrument two centuries

07:34.740 --> 07:35.740
later.

07:35.740 --> 07:36.740
Okay, fair enough.

07:36.740 --> 07:40.600
But this passage makes it sound like Matt Walsh was correct when he said that Lizzo's

07:40.600 --> 07:45.000
performance was a form of racial retribution, or that Ben Shapiro was correct when he called

07:45.000 --> 07:49.320
it a vulgarization of American history, both of whom are people that Jezebel mocked for

07:49.320 --> 07:51.440
caring about this in this very article.

07:51.440 --> 07:55.680
This is literally the don't be silly exclamation while the very thing being described is actually

07:55.680 --> 07:56.680
happening.

07:56.680 --> 08:02.340
This modernist impulse of bringing the high low has been termed as Lizzofication by conservatives.

08:02.340 --> 08:07.140
An article on Revolver titled The Lizzofication of America touches on the surface of the idea.

08:07.140 --> 08:11.720
The left is focused on pushing fat acceptance and beauty at any size, which despite some

08:11.720 --> 08:15.480
good intentions, gives many people who are struggling with food issues and obesity an

08:15.480 --> 08:18.880
excuse to stay in their dangerously unhealthy lifestyle.

08:18.880 --> 08:21.160
Think of it as the Lizzofication of America.

08:21.160 --> 08:25.680
Public artist Lizzo has put her obesity front and center and made her weight the cornerstone

08:25.680 --> 08:26.820
of her brand.

08:26.820 --> 08:31.400
The idea that's being appealed to here is worshipping vice, specifically when it comes

08:31.400 --> 08:32.680
to physical health.

08:32.680 --> 08:37.220
Rare thyroid issues notwithstanding, when somebody works out and does cardio and eats

08:37.220 --> 08:39.380
right, they're not the shape of Lizzo.

08:39.380 --> 08:41.960
They may have been blessed with genetics, but that only gets you so far, and you can

08:41.960 --> 08:45.380
see the result of their virtuous habits in the shape of their body.

08:45.380 --> 08:50.240
But Lizzofication here refers to not valuing the person who keeps himself in good shape,

08:50.240 --> 08:54.160
and viewing their positive, healthy habits as virtuous, but instead valuing letting

08:54.160 --> 08:59.200
yourself go, indulging in vice, becoming a pleasure-seeking animal, putting self-acceptance

08:59.200 --> 09:00.200
over self-improvement.

09:00.200 --> 09:04.720
That's what the phrase Lizzofication refers to in conservative circles.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.120
The weight part of the conversation is only one part.

09:07.120 --> 09:11.220
In a more general sense, Lizzofication refers to the abolishment of moral standards and

09:11.220 --> 09:13.180
a decline into perpetual vice.

09:13.180 --> 09:16.400
The internet has had conceptions of this idea from before Lizzo and the Crystal Flute, of

09:16.400 --> 09:17.400
course.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.520
One theme specifically comes to mind, where the guy is strapped into the coom machine

09:20.520 --> 09:22.960
and spends all day high and orgasming.

09:22.960 --> 09:26.640
Another guy shows up and says, this is kind of weird, and then he's critiqued with OMG

09:26.640 --> 09:28.240
LET PEOPLE ENJOY THINGS.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.640
This is getting at the same sentiment.

09:29.640 --> 09:31.780
We all understand what too little freedom looks like.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.320
It's an oppressive state, a calcified social structure.

09:34.320 --> 09:37.140
Everyone's behaviors are rigidly controlled by top-down power.

09:37.140 --> 09:38.600
That is the 1984 world.

09:38.600 --> 09:42.800
Lizzofication is the newest term in a long line of terms used to refer to what too much

09:42.800 --> 09:46.320
freedom looks like, a complete and total lack of moral standards.

09:46.320 --> 09:50.360
All limits and regulation abolished, everyone simply indulging in whatever base pleasure

09:50.360 --> 09:52.840
strikes their fancy without any thoughts of the future.

09:52.840 --> 09:56.940
This is the Brave New World world, and right-wingers of all stripes have been warning about it

09:56.940 --> 09:58.040
for a long time now.

09:58.040 --> 10:01.760
From the literal author of Brave New World, Huxley, who was a lukewarm conservative himself,

10:01.760 --> 10:06.240
to Julius Evola, the aristocratic post-fascist writer who warned about the Kali Yuga, the

10:06.240 --> 10:10.500
dark age of unleashed materialistic appetites, to Christopher Latch, the American historian

10:10.500 --> 10:15.200
and classical conservative, who wrote at length about how consumerist capitalism eroded traditional

10:15.200 --> 10:17.920
American institutions, like the family or the church.

10:17.920 --> 10:22.280
This is why people on the right tend to reject ideas like self-esteem or self-love.

10:22.280 --> 10:26.380
Not because they necessarily hate the idea of loving yourself, but because excessively

10:26.380 --> 10:31.320
focusing on that kind of purely inward thinking leads to the dissolution of standards.

10:31.320 --> 10:32.320
You've all heard this before.

10:32.320 --> 10:34.400
You don't need to change even though you're 600 pounds.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.400
Love yourself, girl.

10:35.400 --> 10:38.480
If the world doesn't accept you for who you are, that's their problem, not yours.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.480
There is a time and place for that kind of rhetoric.

10:40.480 --> 10:43.200
Sometimes you really are correct, and the world really is wrong.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.080
But do you think that's the case when you're the fucking blob?

10:46.080 --> 10:48.940
That is what conservatives mean when they say the phrase lizzification.

10:48.940 --> 10:53.720
It means they reject the post-Reagan, free-market neo-conservatism that dominated the right

10:53.720 --> 10:55.360
wing from the 80s onward.

10:55.360 --> 10:59.760
As the economics of that system was led by a specific type of classical liberal morality

10:59.760 --> 11:03.980
that posited freedom as the ultimate good, then any barriers or limits placed on people

11:03.980 --> 11:07.440
were restrictions that needed to be abolished in order for freedom to be achieved, even

11:07.440 --> 11:12.040
though in reality at least some of those barriers or limits are both restrictive and good.

11:12.040 --> 11:15.520
Picasso is being used to refer to this concept, because she's currently a big celebrity

11:15.520 --> 11:19.760
and weight gain is just an intuitively easy example of what's being described here.

11:19.760 --> 11:23.800
If you're limited by a rule that states, don't eat so much and work out every day,

11:23.800 --> 11:25.640
that is a restriction on your behavior.

11:25.640 --> 11:28.160
There are some things you can't do, and other things that you must do.

11:28.160 --> 11:32.120
Abolishing that limit does make you more free, but it also makes you a worse person.

11:32.120 --> 11:36.220
Therefore, some types of freedom must be bad for you, and some types of restriction must

11:36.220 --> 11:37.220
be good for you.

11:37.220 --> 11:41.440
For a conservative, this logic applies not only to weight and health, but to all domains

11:41.440 --> 11:44.320
of human activity, like monogamy and romantic relationships.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.120
That is a restriction on who you can sleep with.

11:46.120 --> 11:48.580
Or the duty to help your family and friends in times of need.

11:48.580 --> 11:50.700
That is a restriction on your time and your energy.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.740
These are restrictions, but they're still good.

11:52.740 --> 11:56.480
That is what conservatives mean when they talk about lizzofication, the idea that all

11:56.480 --> 12:00.740
limits and restrictions should be abolished for ideological reasons, even if it actually

12:00.740 --> 12:03.720
makes people's practical lives worse off for it.

12:03.720 --> 12:07.480
As is the case with most of my videos discussing ideas using a current event as a starting

12:07.480 --> 12:11.280
off point, Lizzo herself actually plays second fiddle to the concept of lizzification.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.480
She's the avatar of a more universal concept.

12:13.480 --> 12:16.220
That's not to say she doesn't embody what the conservatives are talking about, though.

12:16.220 --> 12:17.300
She obviously does.

12:17.300 --> 12:20.880
For example, when Lizzo did a Lord of the Rings spot, and Lizzo fans began demanding

12:20.880 --> 12:24.680
she make an appearance in Rings of Power season 2, as if that show couldn't get any worse,

12:24.680 --> 12:26.560
Lord of the Rings fans reacted with disgust.

12:26.560 --> 12:29.980
Okay, Lizzo lass is pretty funny, but seriously, it was mostly disgust.

12:29.980 --> 12:33.480
The disgust wasn't solely aimed at Lizzo, though she got her fair share of it.

12:33.480 --> 12:37.240
It was also aimed at the general concept of the lizzofication of Lord of the Rings, the

12:37.240 --> 12:40.300
idea of profaning what the fans hold as sacred.

12:40.300 --> 12:44.320
Not because Lizzo's in it, but because the loosening of moral standards required to make

12:44.320 --> 12:47.260
Lizzo being in it be considered acceptable.

12:47.260 --> 12:51.400
This clip of Lizzo came across my feed recently, and regular viewer J-Maxx said about it,

12:51.400 --> 12:54.860
I might get hate for this, but this makes me as upset as when super-thin models and

12:54.860 --> 12:58.420
celebrities were pushed into our cultural zeitgeist for girls to aspire to.

12:58.420 --> 13:01.600
The amount of childhood obesity I see in my day-to-day is heartbreaking.

13:01.600 --> 13:05.540
What's being described here is basically that super-thin women in media gave little

13:05.540 --> 13:07.600
girls anorexia in the 90s and 2000s.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.600
That's a pretty well-documented effect at this point.

13:09.600 --> 13:13.320
However, in an effort to tackle that mental health crisis, we've now overcorrected,

13:13.320 --> 13:15.920
and now we're starting to see the opposite negative effect.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.260
Fat women on TV, fat girls in real life.

13:18.260 --> 13:19.680
Neither of these things is good.

13:19.680 --> 13:23.600
We should be promoting health, not the people who throw up their lunch, or the people who

13:23.600 --> 13:24.600
ate the thrown-up lunch.

13:24.600 --> 13:28.680
I did a whole video on fat activism already, but I'm not sure if I ever covered the moral

13:28.680 --> 13:30.200
arguments that underpin it.

13:30.200 --> 13:33.580
There's certainly this attitude that only women have the license to be obese, while

13:33.580 --> 13:37.600
men still need to shape up, at least in the media, which we can partially lay the blame

13:37.600 --> 13:41.000
on feminist activism and no real male equivalent existing for that.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.040
We're seeing the same thing happen with Lizzo that we saw with Tess Holliday, or Adele,

13:45.040 --> 13:46.040
or Lena Dunham.

13:46.040 --> 13:50.160
The pushing of these figures and all of their obese glory as if they were something to aspire

13:50.160 --> 13:51.160
to.

13:51.160 --> 13:55.120
In fact, when we saw the backlash to Adele losing weight, in retrospect, that now seems

13:55.120 --> 13:58.760
to be people getting angry that Adele wasn't simply sticking to the lowest common denominator,

13:58.760 --> 14:00.600
that she was actually bettering herself.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.560
Because getting better means inequality.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.660
It means rising up in a hierarchy of value.

14:04.660 --> 14:06.660
It means virtuous behaviors and habits.

14:06.660 --> 14:11.120
It means rejecting the lowest common denominator that is essential to Lizzofication.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.020
But Dev, why are you talking about this now?

14:13.020 --> 14:15.060
The crystal flute thing isn't a recent event.

14:15.060 --> 14:19.480
Well, Lizzo got slapped with a lawsuit by her backup dancers a week or two ago, claiming

14:19.480 --> 14:23.060
that she made them eat bananas out of sex workers' vaginas.

14:23.060 --> 14:27.060
The court documents claim that during a night in Amsterdam's Red Light district, Lizzo's

14:27.060 --> 14:30.940
employees felt pressured by Lizzo to take turns touching the nude performers, catching

14:30.940 --> 14:35.560
dildos launched from the performers' vaginas, and eating bananas protruding from the performers'

14:35.560 --> 14:39.540
vaginas, and that Lizzo again deceive them into a similar show one month later.

14:39.540 --> 14:43.400
One of the workers, Ariana Davis, also made the claim that she had no choice but to soil

14:43.400 --> 14:47.400
herself on stage during an audition, fearing the repercussions of excusing herself to go

14:47.400 --> 14:48.400
to the bathroom.

14:48.400 --> 14:52.280
Lizzo fired her on the spot after learning that she was recording her meetings, despite

14:52.280 --> 14:56.440
her being contractually entitled to a copy of the notes of those meetings.

14:56.440 --> 15:00.720
The charges brought against Lizzo and her production company include sexual, religious

15:00.720 --> 15:04.860
and racial harassment, disability discrimination, assault, and false imprisonment.

15:04.860 --> 15:08.500
It's possible that Lizzo's innocent and that these are just disgruntled employees blowing

15:08.500 --> 15:11.420
up old stories from 2019 in order to get some money.

15:11.420 --> 15:15.140
We've seen a lot of that kind of thing recently, where people might have an edge case of a

15:15.140 --> 15:18.100
claim, but it's also plausible they were totally okay with it and now they're acting like they're

15:18.100 --> 15:20.180
not in retrospect in order to cancel somebody?

15:20.180 --> 15:21.380
That's pretty common right now.

15:21.380 --> 15:25.760
But despite being a progressive cultural darling, Lizzo is now being canceled because believing

15:25.760 --> 15:27.300
victims has become the new push.

15:27.300 --> 15:31.200
I know Brianna Wu mentioned to me on Twitter that the feminist position is believe women,

15:31.200 --> 15:35.540
as in take sexual assault claims seriously, not believe all women, as in consider all

15:35.540 --> 15:38.400
sexual assault claims to be fact regardless of proof.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.400
And you know what?

15:39.400 --> 15:40.400
Fair enough.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.560
I can actually get behind the first statement.

15:41.560 --> 15:45.440
But there is no doubt in my mind that in the current progressive cultural zeitgeist we

15:45.440 --> 15:49.820
have absolutely shifted towards the second statement, and Lizzo's cancellation is simply

15:49.820 --> 15:51.200
another instance of it happening.

15:51.200 --> 15:55.660
It is reasonable to wonder if these are simply disgruntled employees getting back at their

15:55.660 --> 15:59.260
rich boss a few years later, where nobody knows what actually happened anymore.

15:59.260 --> 16:02.480
But the people canceling Lizzo don't care about that kind of nuance.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.480
They just believe the victims.

16:04.480 --> 16:08.100
The only thing I have to say about that story is, I am not surprised that a woman who represents

16:08.100 --> 16:12.440
the philosophy of having low standards as a moral good might actually end up having

16:12.440 --> 16:14.040
low standards herself.

16:14.040 --> 16:17.820
Lizzo is not a good role model, for anyone, even less so than the celebrities who have

16:17.820 --> 16:20.960
actually said they're not role models, like Charles Barkley for example.

16:20.960 --> 16:25.200
It's one thing to be in the public eye, it's another thing to be held up as a standard.

16:25.240 --> 16:29.380
And Lizzo, just like Tess Holliday or Lena Dunham or Adele, is not a standard to judge

16:29.380 --> 16:30.380
anybody by.

16:30.380 --> 16:34.780
Though, I guess that's the ultimate point, Lizzofication is the final abolishing of the

16:34.780 --> 16:36.100
concept of standards.
