1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,740
As you probably know, I generally don't talk about celebrities on this channel.

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,460
I dipped my toes into that nightmarish mess last year with Sam Smith's decline from

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,900
British pretty boy to swelled-up homunculus, and the year before with Demi Lovato deciding

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,760
to come out as non-binary as an attempt to revive her floundering career.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,000
She walked it back, by the way.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That was always just her trying to grasp for relevance.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,120
Hollywood is cancerous.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,080
I genuinely hate it, and I haven't paid attention to the latest actors or musicians

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,120
or whatever in decades now.

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,240
Even back in high school, when my peers were all over celebrity gossip, I just didn't

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,240
care.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,240
I was too busy playing video games.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,160
And it's just as well, because Hollywood seems to be on its last legs.

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,020
Coronavirus was the death knell for theaters, and they still really haven't seen a revival.

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,600
Nobody cares about watching new movies or TV shows anymore.

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,280
Mainstream music is all garbage.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,160
The celebrities themselves are all preachy pieces of shit.

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,760
Like remember when they all came out to sing John Lennon's Imagine?

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,080
It's come to the point that whenever I see a TikTok collage of celebs talking to the

20
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,860
camera, I legitimately want to just do the opposite of whatever they're saying.

21
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,400
The first time I'd ever even heard of Lizzo as an unplugged anti-normie was this article

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,240
back during the George Floyd protests, where Lizzo along with other celebs joined the chorus

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,040
of people calling for defunding the police.

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,740
Remember in the last video, when I made the claim that the upper class calls for progressive

25
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,240
policies that they won't have to bear the burden of because it makes them seem more

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,920
morally righteous to their peers?

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,880
Yeah, this is pretty much what I'm talking about.

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,360
It's not the gated communities in Hollywood that Lizzo and the other celebs live in that

29
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,540
experience anarchy when the police pull back from an Antifa riot, and they have more than

30
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,280
enough wealth to afford private security when necessary.

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,320
They will never feel the negative effects of defunding the police, which is why they

32
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,000
can call for it so openly.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,360
But what I really remember Lizzo for, and probably the same with you guys, was the whole

34
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,520
crystal flute thing from back in 2022.

35
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,880
Does that ring a bell?

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,880
Here's the story.

37
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,080
During the War of 1812, when the British burned down the White House, Dolly Madison, the wife

38
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,540
of President James Madison, managed to save some historical artifacts during her escape.

39
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,840
The most famous one was a portrait of George Washington, but among the artifacts was James

40
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,080
Madison's crystal flute.

41
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,840
Claude Laurent, or is it Lorraine?

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,280
A French watchmaker and mechanic, invented the process to create glass flutes in 1806.

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,040
This was an important innovation as temperature change altered the sound of the commonly available

44
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,140
wood and ivory flutes at the time.

45
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,980
Many of his flutes are glass flutes, but he did use the same process to make significantly

46
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,760
rarer and more ornate crystal flutes.

47
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,640
He gifted one of the crystal flutes to President Madison to commemorate his second presidential

48
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
inauguration.

49
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,320
The flute passed from the Madison's to Dolly's son from her first marriage, a man named John

50
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,440
Payne Todd.

51
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,000
Todd was known as a gambler and a drinker, and upon his death, the flute passed to his

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,640
doctor, Cornelius Boyle.

53
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,400
It's not confirmed, but it's pretty obvious that Todd made this decision to cover his

54
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,480
medical debts.

55
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,180
The flute stayed in Dr. Boyle's family until it was shown off at the United States National

56
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,740
Museum in 1903.

57
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,780
The Boyle family sold it to Dayton C. Miller, a flute collector and physicist, who gifted

58
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,100
his entire collection of 1,700 flutes to the Library of Congress in 1941.

59
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,220
We don't know if the flute had ever actually been played during all the times it changed

60
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,220
hands.

61
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,900
I'm sure somebody picked it up and blew into it once or twice in private, but since 1941,

62
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:11,120
the flute is confirmed to never have been played until Lizzo picked it up in 2022.

63
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,820
Lizzo is not just a pop singer but also an accomplished flutist, and when she visited

64
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,340
the Library of Congress, she requested to play Madison's flute.

65
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,940
After negotiating with the library staff and Capitol Police, they allowed her to handle

66
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:40,400
the flute under their watch.

67
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,720
Her performance with the flute was actually pretty good, no real complaints here, at least

68
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:50,480
until she twerked with it.

69
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,200
It was at this point that the story became part of the culture war news cycle back in

70
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,640
2022.

71
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,920
Conservatives were in an uproar about the defiling of a priceless American artifact

72
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,980
while progressives were declaring it a triumph of how far black women had come.

73
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,400
After the event, Lizzo asked the library if she could borrow the flute for her Washington

74
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
concert.

75
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,000
They agreed, though they sent the flute to and from the venue under constant guard by

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,280
Capitol Police.

77
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,560
This is when the infamous viral clip took place of Lizzo twerking with the flute dressed

78
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:33,200
up in her gaudy stage attire.

79
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:21,600
Yes, this means this is actually the second time Lizzo twerked with the flute, the first

80
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,120
impromptu at the Library of Congress, the second on stage.

81
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,440
Now personally, I don't give a shit about the crystal flute, and honestly, I am hard

82
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,600
pressed to believe that your average American conservative gave a shit about it before this

83
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,040
event even took place.

84
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,000
There are certain American artifacts that patriots hold dear.

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,440
The Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the first American flag, the Liberty Bell, Mount

86
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,800
Rushmore, and the Statue of Liberty, if we expand to things large enough to also be locations.

87
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,240
These are all artifacts known the world over as being quintessentially American.

88
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,720
But James Madison's flute?

89
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,200
I've never even heard an American mention it before Lizzo twerked with it.

90
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,100
Nonetheless, conservatives declared this to be a grave insult to America when this story

91
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
went viral.

92
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,940
That it was a defilement of a priceless artifact of Americana by an avatar of modernism dragging

93
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,660
a sanctified symbol down to the level of the mundane.

94
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,300
A common view of modernism by conservatives is that both the rejection of spirituality

95
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,900
and the drive to make everything equal leads to the desire to deliberately profane anything

96
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,060
considered sacred, that the high must be brought low.

97
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,800
And there's at least some truth to this.

98
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,020
While we don't know if Lizzo was actually the first person to play Madison's crystal

99
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,660
flute, she probably wasn't in fact, when she stated on stage that nobody's ever played

100
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,940
it before and that she was going to do it, that's the modernist impulse she's referring

101
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,620
to, at least on a subconscious level.

102
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,620
And that makes sense.

103
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,620
Think about it.

104
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,660
If I gave you a historical flute and I told you it had never been played by anybody before,

105
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,220
once it's in your hands, you'd probably feel an urge to play it.

106
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,420
That intrinsic human impulse to be a little chaotic, break a rule, mess with things a

107
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,900
bit, along with the possibility of doing something that nobody's ever done before, that's all

108
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,900
very understandable.

109
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,860
Meanwhile, the people who care about such things would probably feel very strongly that

110
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,020
the continuity of nobody's ever played this flute before should be preserved.

111
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,820
It's very easy to put yourself in the shoes of either person and see why they want what

112
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,820
they want.

113
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,820
And here's the thing.

114
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,660
The response to this conservative outcry by people on the extreme left kind of shows my

115
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,420
analysis of this to be correct.

116
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,200
For example, look at Jezebel's article, conservatives very offended by Lizzo twerking with slave

117
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,540
owners' crystal flute.

118
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,700
Lizzo played the antique instrument on stage for a brief solo, being the first person to

119
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,780
ever do so, liberating it from its vault at the Library of Congress, where it's been stored

120
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,700
for the better part of two centuries.

121
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,900
Let's just take a moment to remind ourselves that Madison owned more than 100 slaves and

122
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,300
originated the three-fifths compromise that refused to recognize black Americans as whole

123
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,300
people.

124
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,740
Lizzo does not owe him the respect of wearing pants to play his instrument two centuries

125
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
later.

126
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,740
Okay, fair enough.

127
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,600
But this passage makes it sound like Matt Walsh was correct when he said that Lizzo's

128
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,000
performance was a form of racial retribution, or that Ben Shapiro was correct when he called

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,320
it a vulgarization of American history, both of whom are people that Jezebel mocked for

130
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,440
caring about this in this very article.

131
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,680
This is literally the don't be silly exclamation while the very thing being described is actually

132
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,680
happening.

133
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,340
This modernist impulse of bringing the high low has been termed as Lizzofication by conservatives.

134
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,140
An article on Revolver titled The Lizzofication of America touches on the surface of the idea.

135
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,720
The left is focused on pushing fat acceptance and beauty at any size, which despite some

136
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,480
good intentions, gives many people who are struggling with food issues and obesity an

137
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,880
excuse to stay in their dangerously unhealthy lifestyle.

138
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,160
Think of it as the Lizzofication of America.

139
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,680
Public artist Lizzo has put her obesity front and center and made her weight the cornerstone

140
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,820
of her brand.

141
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,400
The idea that's being appealed to here is worshipping vice, specifically when it comes

142
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,680
to physical health.

143
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,220
Rare thyroid issues notwithstanding, when somebody works out and does cardio and eats

144
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,380
right, they're not the shape of Lizzo.

145
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,960
They may have been blessed with genetics, but that only gets you so far, and you can

146
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,380
see the result of their virtuous habits in the shape of their body.

147
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,240
But Lizzofication here refers to not valuing the person who keeps himself in good shape,

148
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,160
and viewing their positive, healthy habits as virtuous, but instead valuing letting

149
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,200
yourself go, indulging in vice, becoming a pleasure-seeking animal, putting self-acceptance

150
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
over self-improvement.

151
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,720
That's what the phrase Lizzofication refers to in conservative circles.

152
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,120
The weight part of the conversation is only one part.

153
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,220
In a more general sense, Lizzofication refers to the abolishment of moral standards and

154
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,180
a decline into perpetual vice.

155
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,400
The internet has had conceptions of this idea from before Lizzo and the Crystal Flute, of

156
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
course.

157
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,520
One theme specifically comes to mind, where the guy is strapped into the coom machine

158
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,960
and spends all day high and orgasming.

159
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,640
Another guy shows up and says, this is kind of weird, and then he's critiqued with OMG

160
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,240
LET PEOPLE ENJOY THINGS.

161
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,640
This is getting at the same sentiment.

162
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,780
We all understand what too little freedom looks like.

163
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,320
It's an oppressive state, a calcified social structure.

164
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,140
Everyone's behaviors are rigidly controlled by top-down power.

165
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,600
That is the 1984 world.

166
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,800
Lizzofication is the newest term in a long line of terms used to refer to what too much

167
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,320
freedom looks like, a complete and total lack of moral standards.

168
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,360
All limits and regulation abolished, everyone simply indulging in whatever base pleasure

169
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,840
strikes their fancy without any thoughts of the future.

170
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,940
This is the Brave New World world, and right-wingers of all stripes have been warning about it

171
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,040
for a long time now.

172
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,760
From the literal author of Brave New World, Huxley, who was a lukewarm conservative himself,

173
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,240
to Julius Evola, the aristocratic post-fascist writer who warned about the Kali Yuga, the

174
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,500
dark age of unleashed materialistic appetites, to Christopher Latch, the American historian

175
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,200
and classical conservative, who wrote at length about how consumerist capitalism eroded traditional

176
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,920
American institutions, like the family or the church.

177
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,280
This is why people on the right tend to reject ideas like self-esteem or self-love.

178
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,380
Not because they necessarily hate the idea of loving yourself, but because excessively

179
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:31,320
focusing on that kind of purely inward thinking leads to the dissolution of standards.

180
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
You've all heard this before.

181
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,400
You don't need to change even though you're 600 pounds.

182
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Love yourself, girl.

183
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,480
If the world doesn't accept you for who you are, that's their problem, not yours.

184
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
There is a time and place for that kind of rhetoric.

185
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,200
Sometimes you really are correct, and the world really is wrong.

186
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,080
But do you think that's the case when you're the fucking blob?

187
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,940
That is what conservatives mean when they say the phrase lizzification.

188
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,720
It means they reject the post-Reagan, free-market neo-conservatism that dominated the right

189
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,360
wing from the 80s onward.

190
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,760
As the economics of that system was led by a specific type of classical liberal morality

191
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,980
that posited freedom as the ultimate good, then any barriers or limits placed on people

192
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,440
were restrictions that needed to be abolished in order for freedom to be achieved, even

193
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,040
though in reality at least some of those barriers or limits are both restrictive and good.

194
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,520
Picasso is being used to refer to this concept, because she's currently a big celebrity

195
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,760
and weight gain is just an intuitively easy example of what's being described here.

196
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,800
If you're limited by a rule that states, don't eat so much and work out every day,

197
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,640
that is a restriction on your behavior.

198
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,160
There are some things you can't do, and other things that you must do.

199
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,120
Abolishing that limit does make you more free, but it also makes you a worse person.

200
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,220
Therefore, some types of freedom must be bad for you, and some types of restriction must

201
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,220
be good for you.

202
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,440
For a conservative, this logic applies not only to weight and health, but to all domains

203
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,320
of human activity, like monogamy and romantic relationships.

204
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,120
That is a restriction on who you can sleep with.

205
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,580
Or the duty to help your family and friends in times of need.

206
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,700
That is a restriction on your time and your energy.

207
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,740
These are restrictions, but they're still good.

208
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,480
That is what conservatives mean when they talk about lizzofication, the idea that all

209
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,740
limits and restrictions should be abolished for ideological reasons, even if it actually

210
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,720
makes people's practical lives worse off for it.

211
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,480
As is the case with most of my videos discussing ideas using a current event as a starting

212
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,280
off point, Lizzo herself actually plays second fiddle to the concept of lizzification.

213
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,480
She's the avatar of a more universal concept.

214
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,220
That's not to say she doesn't embody what the conservatives are talking about, though.

215
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,300
She obviously does.

216
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,880
For example, when Lizzo did a Lord of the Rings spot, and Lizzo fans began demanding

217
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,680
she make an appearance in Rings of Power season 2, as if that show couldn't get any worse,

218
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,560
Lord of the Rings fans reacted with disgust.

219
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,980
Okay, Lizzo lass is pretty funny, but seriously, it was mostly disgust.

220
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,480
The disgust wasn't solely aimed at Lizzo, though she got her fair share of it.

221
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,240
It was also aimed at the general concept of the lizzofication of Lord of the Rings, the

222
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,300
idea of profaning what the fans hold as sacred.

223
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,320
Not because Lizzo's in it, but because the loosening of moral standards required to make

224
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,260
Lizzo being in it be considered acceptable.

225
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,400
This clip of Lizzo came across my feed recently, and regular viewer J-Maxx said about it,

226
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,860
I might get hate for this, but this makes me as upset as when super-thin models and

227
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,420
celebrities were pushed into our cultural zeitgeist for girls to aspire to.

228
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,600
The amount of childhood obesity I see in my day-to-day is heartbreaking.

229
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,540
What's being described here is basically that super-thin women in media gave little

230
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,600
girls anorexia in the 90s and 2000s.

231
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
That's a pretty well-documented effect at this point.

232
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,320
However, in an effort to tackle that mental health crisis, we've now overcorrected,

233
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,920
and now we're starting to see the opposite negative effect.

234
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,260
Fat women on TV, fat girls in real life.

235
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,680
Neither of these things is good.

236
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,600
We should be promoting health, not the people who throw up their lunch, or the people who

237
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
ate the thrown-up lunch.

238
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,680
I did a whole video on fat activism already, but I'm not sure if I ever covered the moral

239
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,200
arguments that underpin it.

240
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,580
There's certainly this attitude that only women have the license to be obese, while

241
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,600
men still need to shape up, at least in the media, which we can partially lay the blame

242
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,000
on feminist activism and no real male equivalent existing for that.

243
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,040
We're seeing the same thing happen with Lizzo that we saw with Tess Holliday, or Adele,

244
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
or Lena Dunham.

245
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,160
The pushing of these figures and all of their obese glory as if they were something to aspire

246
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
to.

247
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,120
In fact, when we saw the backlash to Adele losing weight, in retrospect, that now seems

248
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,760
to be people getting angry that Adele wasn't simply sticking to the lowest common denominator,

249
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,600
that she was actually bettering herself.

250
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,560
Because getting better means inequality.

251
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,660
It means rising up in a hierarchy of value.

252
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,660
It means virtuous behaviors and habits.

253
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,120
It means rejecting the lowest common denominator that is essential to Lizzofication.

254
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,020
But Dev, why are you talking about this now?

255
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,060
The crystal flute thing isn't a recent event.

256
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,480
Well, Lizzo got slapped with a lawsuit by her backup dancers a week or two ago, claiming

257
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,060
that she made them eat bananas out of sex workers' vaginas.

258
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,060
The court documents claim that during a night in Amsterdam's Red Light district, Lizzo's

259
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,940
employees felt pressured by Lizzo to take turns touching the nude performers, catching

260
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,560
dildos launched from the performers' vaginas, and eating bananas protruding from the performers'

261
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,540
vaginas, and that Lizzo again deceive them into a similar show one month later.

262
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,400
One of the workers, Ariana Davis, also made the claim that she had no choice but to soil

263
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,400
herself on stage during an audition, fearing the repercussions of excusing herself to go

264
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
to the bathroom.

265
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,280
Lizzo fired her on the spot after learning that she was recording her meetings, despite

266
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,440
her being contractually entitled to a copy of the notes of those meetings.

267
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,720
The charges brought against Lizzo and her production company include sexual, religious

268
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,860
and racial harassment, disability discrimination, assault, and false imprisonment.

269
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,500
It's possible that Lizzo's innocent and that these are just disgruntled employees blowing

270
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,420
up old stories from 2019 in order to get some money.

271
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,140
We've seen a lot of that kind of thing recently, where people might have an edge case of a

272
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,100
claim, but it's also plausible they were totally okay with it and now they're acting like they're

273
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,180
not in retrospect in order to cancel somebody?

274
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,380
That's pretty common right now.

275
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,760
But despite being a progressive cultural darling, Lizzo is now being canceled because believing

276
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,300
victims has become the new push.

277
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,200
I know Brianna Wu mentioned to me on Twitter that the feminist position is believe women,

278
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,540
as in take sexual assault claims seriously, not believe all women, as in consider all

279
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,400
sexual assault claims to be fact regardless of proof.

280
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
And you know what?

281
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
Fair enough.

282
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,560
I can actually get behind the first statement.

283
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,440
But there is no doubt in my mind that in the current progressive cultural zeitgeist we

284
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,820
have absolutely shifted towards the second statement, and Lizzo's cancellation is simply

285
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,200
another instance of it happening.

286
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,660
It is reasonable to wonder if these are simply disgruntled employees getting back at their

287
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,260
rich boss a few years later, where nobody knows what actually happened anymore.

288
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,480
But the people canceling Lizzo don't care about that kind of nuance.

289
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
They just believe the victims.

290
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,100
The only thing I have to say about that story is, I am not surprised that a woman who represents

291
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,440
the philosophy of having low standards as a moral good might actually end up having

292
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,040
low standards herself.

293
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,820
Lizzo is not a good role model, for anyone, even less so than the celebrities who have

294
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,960
actually said they're not role models, like Charles Barkley for example.

295
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,200
It's one thing to be in the public eye, it's another thing to be held up as a standard.

296
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,380
And Lizzo, just like Tess Holliday or Lena Dunham or Adele, is not a standard to judge

297
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,380
anybody by.

298
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,780
Though, I guess that's the ultimate point, Lizzofication is the final abolishing of the

299
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,100
concept of standards.
