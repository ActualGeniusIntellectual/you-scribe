0	9740	As you probably know, I generally don't talk about celebrities on this channel.
9740	14460	I dipped my toes into that nightmarish mess last year with Sam Smith's decline from
14460	18900	British pretty boy to swelled-up homunculus, and the year before with Demi Lovato deciding
18900	22760	to come out as non-binary as an attempt to revive her floundering career.
22760	24000	She walked it back, by the way.
24000	27000	That was always just her trying to grasp for relevance.
27000	28120	Hollywood is cancerous.
28120	32080	I genuinely hate it, and I haven't paid attention to the latest actors or musicians
32080	34120	or whatever in decades now.
34120	37240	Even back in high school, when my peers were all over celebrity gossip, I just didn't
37240	38240	care.
38240	39240	I was too busy playing video games.
39240	42160	And it's just as well, because Hollywood seems to be on its last legs.
42160	46020	Coronavirus was the death knell for theaters, and they still really haven't seen a revival.
46020	48600	Nobody cares about watching new movies or TV shows anymore.
48600	50280	Mainstream music is all garbage.
50280	53160	The celebrities themselves are all preachy pieces of shit.
53160	55760	Like remember when they all came out to sing John Lennon's Imagine?
55760	59080	It's come to the point that whenever I see a TikTok collage of celebs talking to the
59080	62860	camera, I legitimately want to just do the opposite of whatever they're saying.
62860	67400	The first time I'd ever even heard of Lizzo as an unplugged anti-normie was this article
67400	72240	back during the George Floyd protests, where Lizzo along with other celebs joined the chorus
72240	75040	of people calling for defunding the police.
75040	77740	Remember in the last video, when I made the claim that the upper class calls for progressive
77740	81240	policies that they won't have to bear the burden of because it makes them seem more
81240	82920	morally righteous to their peers?
82920	84880	Yeah, this is pretty much what I'm talking about.
84880	88360	It's not the gated communities in Hollywood that Lizzo and the other celebs live in that
88360	92540	experience anarchy when the police pull back from an Antifa riot, and they have more than
92540	95280	enough wealth to afford private security when necessary.
95280	98320	They will never feel the negative effects of defunding the police, which is why they
98320	100000	can call for it so openly.
100000	103360	But what I really remember Lizzo for, and probably the same with you guys, was the whole
103360	105520	crystal flute thing from back in 2022.
105520	106880	Does that ring a bell?
106880	107880	Here's the story.
107880	112080	During the War of 1812, when the British burned down the White House, Dolly Madison, the wife
112080	116540	of President James Madison, managed to save some historical artifacts during her escape.
116540	120840	The most famous one was a portrait of George Washington, but among the artifacts was James
120840	122080	Madison's crystal flute.
122080	123840	Claude Laurent, or is it Lorraine?
123840	129280	A French watchmaker and mechanic, invented the process to create glass flutes in 1806.
129280	133040	This was an important innovation as temperature change altered the sound of the commonly available
133040	135140	wood and ivory flutes at the time.
135140	138980	Many of his flutes are glass flutes, but he did use the same process to make significantly
138980	141760	rarer and more ornate crystal flutes.
141760	145640	He gifted one of the crystal flutes to President Madison to commemorate his second presidential
145640	146640	inauguration.
146640	151320	The flute passed from the Madison's to Dolly's son from her first marriage, a man named John
151320	152440	Payne Todd.
152440	156000	Todd was known as a gambler and a drinker, and upon his death, the flute passed to his
156000	157640	doctor, Cornelius Boyle.
157640	161400	It's not confirmed, but it's pretty obvious that Todd made this decision to cover his
161400	162480	medical debts.
162480	166180	The flute stayed in Dr. Boyle's family until it was shown off at the United States National
166180	167740	Museum in 1903.
167740	171780	The Boyle family sold it to Dayton C. Miller, a flute collector and physicist, who gifted
171780	177100	his entire collection of 1,700 flutes to the Library of Congress in 1941.
177100	181220	We don't know if the flute had ever actually been played during all the times it changed
181220	182220	hands.
182220	185900	I'm sure somebody picked it up and blew into it once or twice in private, but since 1941,
185900	191120	the flute is confirmed to never have been played until Lizzo picked it up in 2022.
191120	194820	Lizzo is not just a pop singer but also an accomplished flutist, and when she visited
194820	198340	the Library of Congress, she requested to play Madison's flute.
198340	201940	After negotiating with the library staff and Capitol Police, they allowed her to handle
201940	220400	the flute under their watch.
220400	223720	Her performance with the flute was actually pretty good, no real complaints here, at least
223720	230480	until she twerked with it.
230480	234200	It was at this point that the story became part of the culture war news cycle back in
234200	235640	2022.
235640	238920	Conservatives were in an uproar about the defiling of a priceless American artifact
238920	242980	while progressives were declaring it a triumph of how far black women had come.
242980	247400	After the event, Lizzo asked the library if she could borrow the flute for her Washington
247400	248400	concert.
248400	252000	They agreed, though they sent the flute to and from the venue under constant guard by
252000	253280	Capitol Police.
253280	257560	This is when the infamous viral clip took place of Lizzo twerking with the flute dressed
257560	273200	up in her gaudy stage attire.
303200	321600	Yes, this means this is actually the second time Lizzo twerked with the flute, the first
321600	324120	impromptu at the Library of Congress, the second on stage.
324120	327440	Now personally, I don't give a shit about the crystal flute, and honestly, I am hard
327440	330600	pressed to believe that your average American conservative gave a shit about it before this
330600	332040	event even took place.
332040	335000	There are certain American artifacts that patriots hold dear.
335000	338440	The Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the first American flag, the Liberty Bell, Mount
338440	342800	Rushmore, and the Statue of Liberty, if we expand to things large enough to also be locations.
342800	347240	These are all artifacts known the world over as being quintessentially American.
347240	348720	But James Madison's flute?
348720	352200	I've never even heard an American mention it before Lizzo twerked with it.
352200	356100	Nonetheless, conservatives declared this to be a grave insult to America when this story
356100	357100	went viral.
357100	361940	That it was a defilement of a priceless artifact of Americana by an avatar of modernism dragging
361940	364660	a sanctified symbol down to the level of the mundane.
364660	369300	A common view of modernism by conservatives is that both the rejection of spirituality
369300	373900	and the drive to make everything equal leads to the desire to deliberately profane anything
373900	377060	considered sacred, that the high must be brought low.
377060	378800	And there's at least some truth to this.
378800	382020	While we don't know if Lizzo was actually the first person to play Madison's crystal
382020	385660	flute, she probably wasn't in fact, when she stated on stage that nobody's ever played
385660	388940	it before and that she was going to do it, that's the modernist impulse she's referring
388940	390620	to, at least on a subconscious level.
390620	391620	And that makes sense.
391620	392620	Think about it.
392620	395660	If I gave you a historical flute and I told you it had never been played by anybody before,
395660	398220	once it's in your hands, you'd probably feel an urge to play it.
398220	401420	That intrinsic human impulse to be a little chaotic, break a rule, mess with things a
401420	404900	bit, along with the possibility of doing something that nobody's ever done before, that's all
404900	405900	very understandable.
405900	409860	Meanwhile, the people who care about such things would probably feel very strongly that
409860	414020	the continuity of nobody's ever played this flute before should be preserved.
414020	417820	It's very easy to put yourself in the shoes of either person and see why they want what
417820	418820	they want.
418820	419820	And here's the thing.
419820	423660	The response to this conservative outcry by people on the extreme left kind of shows my
423660	425420	analysis of this to be correct.
425420	430200	For example, look at Jezebel's article, conservatives very offended by Lizzo twerking with slave
430200	431540	owners' crystal flute.
431540	435700	Lizzo played the antique instrument on stage for a brief solo, being the first person to
435700	439780	ever do so, liberating it from its vault at the Library of Congress, where it's been stored
439780	441700	for the better part of two centuries.
441700	445900	Let's just take a moment to remind ourselves that Madison owned more than 100 slaves and
445900	450300	originated the three-fifths compromise that refused to recognize black Americans as whole
450300	451300	people.
451300	454740	Lizzo does not owe him the respect of wearing pants to play his instrument two centuries
454740	455740	later.
455740	456740	Okay, fair enough.
456740	460600	But this passage makes it sound like Matt Walsh was correct when he said that Lizzo's
460600	465000	performance was a form of racial retribution, or that Ben Shapiro was correct when he called
465000	469320	it a vulgarization of American history, both of whom are people that Jezebel mocked for
469320	471440	caring about this in this very article.
471440	475680	This is literally the don't be silly exclamation while the very thing being described is actually
475680	476680	happening.
476680	482340	This modernist impulse of bringing the high low has been termed as Lizzofication by conservatives.
482340	487140	An article on Revolver titled The Lizzofication of America touches on the surface of the idea.
487140	491720	The left is focused on pushing fat acceptance and beauty at any size, which despite some
491720	495480	good intentions, gives many people who are struggling with food issues and obesity an
495480	498880	excuse to stay in their dangerously unhealthy lifestyle.
498880	501160	Think of it as the Lizzofication of America.
501160	505680	Public artist Lizzo has put her obesity front and center and made her weight the cornerstone
505680	506820	of her brand.
506820	511400	The idea that's being appealed to here is worshipping vice, specifically when it comes
511400	512680	to physical health.
512680	517220	Rare thyroid issues notwithstanding, when somebody works out and does cardio and eats
517220	519380	right, they're not the shape of Lizzo.
519380	521960	They may have been blessed with genetics, but that only gets you so far, and you can
521960	525380	see the result of their virtuous habits in the shape of their body.
525380	530240	But Lizzofication here refers to not valuing the person who keeps himself in good shape,
530240	534160	and viewing their positive, healthy habits as virtuous, but instead valuing letting
534160	539200	yourself go, indulging in vice, becoming a pleasure-seeking animal, putting self-acceptance
539200	540200	over self-improvement.
540200	544720	That's what the phrase Lizzofication refers to in conservative circles.
544720	547120	The weight part of the conversation is only one part.
547120	551220	In a more general sense, Lizzofication refers to the abolishment of moral standards and
551220	553180	a decline into perpetual vice.
553180	556400	The internet has had conceptions of this idea from before Lizzo and the Crystal Flute, of
556400	557400	course.
557400	560520	One theme specifically comes to mind, where the guy is strapped into the coom machine
560520	562960	and spends all day high and orgasming.
562960	566640	Another guy shows up and says, this is kind of weird, and then he's critiqued with OMG
566640	568240	LET PEOPLE ENJOY THINGS.
568240	569640	This is getting at the same sentiment.
569640	571780	We all understand what too little freedom looks like.
571780	574320	It's an oppressive state, a calcified social structure.
574320	577140	Everyone's behaviors are rigidly controlled by top-down power.
577140	578600	That is the 1984 world.
578600	582800	Lizzofication is the newest term in a long line of terms used to refer to what too much
582800	586320	freedom looks like, a complete and total lack of moral standards.
586320	590360	All limits and regulation abolished, everyone simply indulging in whatever base pleasure
590360	592840	strikes their fancy without any thoughts of the future.
592840	596940	This is the Brave New World world, and right-wingers of all stripes have been warning about it
596940	598040	for a long time now.
598040	601760	From the literal author of Brave New World, Huxley, who was a lukewarm conservative himself,
601760	606240	to Julius Evola, the aristocratic post-fascist writer who warned about the Kali Yuga, the
606240	610500	dark age of unleashed materialistic appetites, to Christopher Latch, the American historian
610500	615200	and classical conservative, who wrote at length about how consumerist capitalism eroded traditional
615200	617920	American institutions, like the family or the church.
617920	622280	This is why people on the right tend to reject ideas like self-esteem or self-love.
622280	626380	Not because they necessarily hate the idea of loving yourself, but because excessively
626380	631320	focusing on that kind of purely inward thinking leads to the dissolution of standards.
631320	632320	You've all heard this before.
632320	634400	You don't need to change even though you're 600 pounds.
634400	635400	Love yourself, girl.
635400	638480	If the world doesn't accept you for who you are, that's their problem, not yours.
638480	640480	There is a time and place for that kind of rhetoric.
640480	643200	Sometimes you really are correct, and the world really is wrong.
643200	646080	But do you think that's the case when you're the fucking blob?
646080	648940	That is what conservatives mean when they say the phrase lizzification.
648940	653720	It means they reject the post-Reagan, free-market neo-conservatism that dominated the right
653720	655360	wing from the 80s onward.
655360	659760	As the economics of that system was led by a specific type of classical liberal morality
659760	663980	that posited freedom as the ultimate good, then any barriers or limits placed on people
663980	667440	were restrictions that needed to be abolished in order for freedom to be achieved, even
667440	672040	though in reality at least some of those barriers or limits are both restrictive and good.
672040	675520	Picasso is being used to refer to this concept, because she's currently a big celebrity
675520	679760	and weight gain is just an intuitively easy example of what's being described here.
679760	683800	If you're limited by a rule that states, don't eat so much and work out every day,
683800	685640	that is a restriction on your behavior.
685640	688160	There are some things you can't do, and other things that you must do.
688160	692120	Abolishing that limit does make you more free, but it also makes you a worse person.
692120	696220	Therefore, some types of freedom must be bad for you, and some types of restriction must
696220	697220	be good for you.
697220	701440	For a conservative, this logic applies not only to weight and health, but to all domains
701440	704320	of human activity, like monogamy and romantic relationships.
704320	706120	That is a restriction on who you can sleep with.
706120	708580	Or the duty to help your family and friends in times of need.
708580	710700	That is a restriction on your time and your energy.
710700	712740	These are restrictions, but they're still good.
712740	716480	That is what conservatives mean when they talk about lizzofication, the idea that all
716480	720740	limits and restrictions should be abolished for ideological reasons, even if it actually
720740	723720	makes people's practical lives worse off for it.
723720	727480	As is the case with most of my videos discussing ideas using a current event as a starting
727480	731280	off point, Lizzo herself actually plays second fiddle to the concept of lizzification.
731280	733480	She's the avatar of a more universal concept.
733480	736220	That's not to say she doesn't embody what the conservatives are talking about, though.
736220	737300	She obviously does.
737300	740880	For example, when Lizzo did a Lord of the Rings spot, and Lizzo fans began demanding
740880	744680	she make an appearance in Rings of Power season 2, as if that show couldn't get any worse,
744680	746560	Lord of the Rings fans reacted with disgust.
746560	749980	Okay, Lizzo lass is pretty funny, but seriously, it was mostly disgust.
749980	753480	The disgust wasn't solely aimed at Lizzo, though she got her fair share of it.
753480	757240	It was also aimed at the general concept of the lizzofication of Lord of the Rings, the
757240	760300	idea of profaning what the fans hold as sacred.
760300	764320	Not because Lizzo's in it, but because the loosening of moral standards required to make
764320	767260	Lizzo being in it be considered acceptable.
767260	771400	This clip of Lizzo came across my feed recently, and regular viewer J-Maxx said about it,
771400	774860	I might get hate for this, but this makes me as upset as when super-thin models and
774860	778420	celebrities were pushed into our cultural zeitgeist for girls to aspire to.
778420	781600	The amount of childhood obesity I see in my day-to-day is heartbreaking.
781600	785540	What's being described here is basically that super-thin women in media gave little
785540	787600	girls anorexia in the 90s and 2000s.
787600	789600	That's a pretty well-documented effect at this point.
789600	793320	However, in an effort to tackle that mental health crisis, we've now overcorrected,
793320	795920	and now we're starting to see the opposite negative effect.
795920	798260	Fat women on TV, fat girls in real life.
798260	799680	Neither of these things is good.
799680	803600	We should be promoting health, not the people who throw up their lunch, or the people who
803600	804600	ate the thrown-up lunch.
804600	808680	I did a whole video on fat activism already, but I'm not sure if I ever covered the moral
808680	810200	arguments that underpin it.
810200	813580	There's certainly this attitude that only women have the license to be obese, while
813580	817600	men still need to shape up, at least in the media, which we can partially lay the blame
817600	821000	on feminist activism and no real male equivalent existing for that.
821000	825040	We're seeing the same thing happen with Lizzo that we saw with Tess Holliday, or Adele,
825040	826040	or Lena Dunham.
826040	830160	The pushing of these figures and all of their obese glory as if they were something to aspire
830160	831160	to.
831160	835120	In fact, when we saw the backlash to Adele losing weight, in retrospect, that now seems
835120	838760	to be people getting angry that Adele wasn't simply sticking to the lowest common denominator,
838760	840600	that she was actually bettering herself.
840600	842560	Because getting better means inequality.
842560	844660	It means rising up in a hierarchy of value.
844660	846660	It means virtuous behaviors and habits.
846660	851120	It means rejecting the lowest common denominator that is essential to Lizzofication.
851120	853020	But Dev, why are you talking about this now?
853020	855060	The crystal flute thing isn't a recent event.
855060	859480	Well, Lizzo got slapped with a lawsuit by her backup dancers a week or two ago, claiming
859480	863060	that she made them eat bananas out of sex workers' vaginas.
863060	867060	The court documents claim that during a night in Amsterdam's Red Light district, Lizzo's
867060	870940	employees felt pressured by Lizzo to take turns touching the nude performers, catching
870940	875560	dildos launched from the performers' vaginas, and eating bananas protruding from the performers'
875560	879540	vaginas, and that Lizzo again deceive them into a similar show one month later.
879540	883400	One of the workers, Ariana Davis, also made the claim that she had no choice but to soil
883400	887400	herself on stage during an audition, fearing the repercussions of excusing herself to go
887400	888400	to the bathroom.
888400	892280	Lizzo fired her on the spot after learning that she was recording her meetings, despite
892280	896440	her being contractually entitled to a copy of the notes of those meetings.
896440	900720	The charges brought against Lizzo and her production company include sexual, religious
900720	904860	and racial harassment, disability discrimination, assault, and false imprisonment.
904860	908500	It's possible that Lizzo's innocent and that these are just disgruntled employees blowing
908500	911420	up old stories from 2019 in order to get some money.
911420	915140	We've seen a lot of that kind of thing recently, where people might have an edge case of a
915140	918100	claim, but it's also plausible they were totally okay with it and now they're acting like they're
918100	920180	not in retrospect in order to cancel somebody?
920180	921380	That's pretty common right now.
921380	925760	But despite being a progressive cultural darling, Lizzo is now being canceled because believing
925760	927300	victims has become the new push.
927300	931200	I know Brianna Wu mentioned to me on Twitter that the feminist position is believe women,
931200	935540	as in take sexual assault claims seriously, not believe all women, as in consider all
935540	938400	sexual assault claims to be fact regardless of proof.
938400	939400	And you know what?
939400	940400	Fair enough.
940400	941560	I can actually get behind the first statement.
941560	945440	But there is no doubt in my mind that in the current progressive cultural zeitgeist we
945440	949820	have absolutely shifted towards the second statement, and Lizzo's cancellation is simply
949820	951200	another instance of it happening.
951200	955660	It is reasonable to wonder if these are simply disgruntled employees getting back at their
955660	959260	rich boss a few years later, where nobody knows what actually happened anymore.
959260	962480	But the people canceling Lizzo don't care about that kind of nuance.
962480	964480	They just believe the victims.
964480	968100	The only thing I have to say about that story is, I am not surprised that a woman who represents
968100	972440	the philosophy of having low standards as a moral good might actually end up having
972440	974040	low standards herself.
974040	977820	Lizzo is not a good role model, for anyone, even less so than the celebrities who have
977820	980960	actually said they're not role models, like Charles Barkley for example.
980960	985200	It's one thing to be in the public eye, it's another thing to be held up as a standard.
985240	989380	And Lizzo, just like Tess Holliday or Lena Dunham or Adele, is not a standard to judge
989380	990380	anybody by.
990380	994780	Though, I guess that's the ultimate point, Lizzofication is the final abolishing of the
994780	996100	concept of standards.
