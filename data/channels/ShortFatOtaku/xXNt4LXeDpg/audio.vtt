00:00.000 --> 00:01.540
What's up guys, Dev here.

00:01.540 --> 00:03.640
Welcome to TikTok Tuesday once again.

00:03.640 --> 00:06.340
For those of you who actually do watch TikTok Tuesday

00:06.340 --> 00:08.140
and don't skip these videos,

00:08.140 --> 00:10.020
because, I mean, they are kind of trash,

00:10.020 --> 00:13.620
I'm going to give you guys a sneak peek,

00:13.620 --> 00:16.320
a hint at the upcoming content.

00:16.320 --> 00:19.500
I've spent a good chunk of today working on a script

00:19.500 --> 00:22.580
for the Skullgirls censorship controversy.

00:22.580 --> 00:24.260
Now, a lot of channels have talked about this, right?

00:24.260 --> 00:25.740
I think V has talked about it.

00:25.740 --> 00:27.620
Sid Alpha's talked about it.

00:27.620 --> 00:29.140
Affabend's talked about it.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.040
A whole bunch of these culture war channels

00:31.040 --> 00:33.000
have talked about Skullgirls getting censored.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.440
And I figured since I'm trying to work

00:34.440 --> 00:35.920
through some writer's block,

00:35.920 --> 00:38.700
that would be a pretty easy topic for me to tackle.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.420
I'll quickly whip up like a 10 minute video

00:40.420 --> 00:42.080
and put it out and we'll be on our way.

00:42.080 --> 00:43.800
But as I began researching for it,

00:43.800 --> 00:46.360
I found a whole bunch of stuff,

00:46.360 --> 00:47.800
a completely new angle

00:47.800 --> 00:49.720
that most people aren't really talking about.

00:49.720 --> 00:51.000
And I was like, oh my God,

00:51.000 --> 00:52.840
this story goes way further

00:52.840 --> 00:55.640
than just censoring old problematic content

00:55.640 --> 00:56.760
for a modern audience

00:56.760 --> 00:59.000
by a bunch of new woke game developers

00:59.700 --> 01:00.860
who took the IP from the original creators.

01:00.860 --> 01:01.700
No, no, no, no.

01:01.700 --> 01:02.860
That's actually surface level.

01:02.860 --> 01:04.860
My tiny 10 minute script turned

01:04.860 --> 01:06.700
into a Skullgirls deep dive

01:06.700 --> 01:08.900
and that'll be something that you guys will see soon.

01:08.900 --> 01:10.700
But for now, your TikToks.

01:10.700 --> 01:11.540
Let's roll them.

01:13.580 --> 01:15.360
Know your local fascists.

01:16.940 --> 01:20.020
We keep us, is it like publicly available?

01:21.180 --> 01:22.860
Oh, and it's just like everyone's docs.

01:22.860 --> 01:24.460
Okay, let's see what it says here.

01:24.460 --> 01:27.180
A list of prominent bigots transphobes

01:27.180 --> 01:32.180
working to advanced, advanced white Christian nationalism.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.920
You could at least spell check this, you know.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.400
But okay, this group is apparently,

01:35.400 --> 01:36.300
I don't know what city this is,

01:36.300 --> 01:37.640
but they're putting out a booklet

01:37.640 --> 01:38.800
where you can see the people

01:38.800 --> 01:41.360
that they call bigots and transphobes

01:41.360 --> 01:42.500
who live in the area.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.440
This is more of the apprehensible.

01:44.440 --> 01:47.280
This will be used by some extremist as a hit list.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.880
One, who the fuck even says these people

01:49.880 --> 01:52.020
are actually bigots or transphobes

01:52.020 --> 01:54.000
or Christian nationalists?

01:54.000 --> 01:56.680
And two, they shouldn't be randomly attacked

01:57.140 --> 01:58.580
in the street, even if they are.

01:58.580 --> 02:01.340
This is simply a political hit list.

02:01.340 --> 02:02.700
The publishing of this book

02:02.700 --> 02:05.460
should be treated as a call to violence.

02:05.460 --> 02:07.580
Also, I like how the first person they flip to

02:07.580 --> 02:08.780
isn't even a white person.

02:08.780 --> 02:09.700
Good job.

02:09.700 --> 02:11.260
Good job, you fucking retards.

02:13.340 --> 02:14.180
What is this?

02:17.260 --> 02:18.420
Just eating a burger.

02:21.980 --> 02:24.180
Oh, were they like vegan activists or something?

02:24.180 --> 02:25.380
That has to be it, hold on.

02:25.380 --> 02:26.300
Let's watch that again.

02:26.800 --> 02:27.920
He's eating like a chicken burger.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.560
Yeah, they gotta be vegan activists or something

02:30.560 --> 02:33.040
doing this sort of like sit-down protest.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.040
Yeah, look at how this person's looking at him.

02:35.040 --> 02:36.280
It's like, how dare you?

02:36.280 --> 02:38.680
How dare you eat a chicken burger in my vicinity?

02:38.680 --> 02:39.600
That's pretty good.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.960
That's a pretty good troll.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.240
This one's called Portland Core.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.080
Oh, here we go.

02:45.520 --> 02:46.920
This the inside of a subway?

02:49.080 --> 02:51.360
Hey, you left your backpack, sir.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.040
No, I know I did.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.920
Give me my sandwich.

02:54.940 --> 02:58.020
I need you to take your backpack in, please, please.

02:58.020 --> 02:59.740
Give me my sandwich.

03:00.580 --> 03:03.020
Give me my sandwich, bitch.

03:03.020 --> 03:05.780
Give me my sandwich, you fucking bitch.

03:06.780 --> 03:07.860
Do you think he was holding a gun?

03:07.860 --> 03:08.700
Like, yeah, that guy.

03:08.700 --> 03:10.020
Sir, I need you to take yours.

03:10.020 --> 03:12.100
Give me my sandwich, bitch.

03:12.100 --> 03:12.940
Please.

03:12.940 --> 03:15.060
Give me my sandwich, bitch.

03:15.060 --> 03:16.700
Give me my sandwich, bitch.

03:16.700 --> 03:17.820
What the fuck?

03:17.820 --> 03:19.700
Give me my shit, bitch.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.980
That's a knocked over chip display.

03:20.980 --> 03:23.100
Did he knock that over when he was here before?

03:23.120 --> 03:25.360
Okay, take the chips, please leave.

03:25.360 --> 03:30.360
No, I need you to give me my fucking shit, bitch.

03:30.840 --> 03:31.680
Oh my God.

03:31.680 --> 03:34.480
How about that, bitch?

03:34.480 --> 03:36.120
You think I'm stupid?

03:36.120 --> 03:38.040
Drugs, not even once, guys.

03:38.040 --> 03:39.000
Holy shit.

03:40.360 --> 03:42.160
Oh, the cops got him.

03:42.160 --> 03:45.480
What a fucking rude.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.520
Yeah, man, fuck that guy.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.400
Hey, man, like I said in my Portland video,

03:50.400 --> 03:51.640
get the fuck out of there.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.500
Inner city drug users are no joke.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.500
I mean, that guy kind of was.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.020
All he did was knock a few stands over.

03:56.020 --> 03:58.540
That's kind of annoying, but it wasn't really dangerous.

03:58.540 --> 03:59.660
He could have been, I guess,

03:59.660 --> 04:01.180
but he ended up just being a fucking loser.

04:01.180 --> 04:03.240
Still, these people are degenerates.

04:04.900 --> 04:07.100
Oh, another smash and grab.

04:08.740 --> 04:11.580
Looks like they're breaking into a jewelry store this time.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.460
Yeah, yeah.

04:14.540 --> 04:17.140
You got to redistribute the goods to the community, guys.

04:17.140 --> 04:17.960
That's what's going on.

04:17.960 --> 04:19.140
Oh, why'd you turn it sideways, dude?

04:19.140 --> 04:20.480
Come on.

04:20.500 --> 04:21.940
That's what's going on here, though.

04:21.940 --> 04:24.540
It's for the good of the whole community.

04:24.540 --> 04:26.740
This is expropriation, guys.

04:29.940 --> 04:32.300
They need these jewels, you know what I mean?

04:33.380 --> 04:35.620
I hate fucking looting at this point.

04:35.620 --> 04:37.820
I've seen so many goddamn looting videos

04:37.820 --> 04:40.660
and like shop listing videos, Christ.

04:40.660 --> 04:42.100
This can't continue indefinitely.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.280
Like either these stores pull out

04:44.280 --> 04:47.860
and let these places rot or they start having security

04:47.860 --> 04:49.300
or they start having police

04:49.320 --> 04:51.480
and the police got to arrest people who were doing this.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.280
You can't live like this in perpetuity.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.460
Why would companies just keep throwing money

04:55.460 --> 04:58.440
into a pit like this where everything keeps getting stolen?

04:58.440 --> 05:01.880
These people are destroying the social fabric

05:01.880 --> 05:03.560
of the places in which they live.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.120
He's just saying he doesn't want a girl

05:05.120 --> 05:07.600
who has dude friends and posts thirst traps.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.760
Wow, so abusive.

05:08.760 --> 05:11.640
It's wild to me that this has been normalized.

05:11.640 --> 05:14.400
Yes, trying to control who your partner can

05:14.400 --> 05:15.960
and cannot be friends with is controlling

05:15.960 --> 05:18.080
abusive, unacceptable behavior.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.020
In those texts, he was saying,

05:19.020 --> 05:20.820
not only can you not be friends with men,

05:20.820 --> 05:21.980
but you can't be friends with women

05:21.980 --> 05:23.860
that I deem troubled or a bad influence.

05:23.860 --> 05:25.140
Yeah, this is Jonah Hill things, okay.

05:25.140 --> 05:27.340
This is like paternalistic behavior.

05:27.340 --> 05:29.560
Who gives you the right to determine

05:29.560 --> 05:31.780
who your partner gets to be friends with?

05:31.780 --> 05:33.180
Listen, listen, it's part of being

05:33.180 --> 05:34.780
in a fucking relationship, honey.

05:34.780 --> 05:36.580
That's just how it is, you know what?

05:36.580 --> 05:39.020
There are certain restrictions I place on my girlfriend.

05:39.020 --> 05:42.340
There are certain restrictions she places on me in turn.

05:42.340 --> 05:43.980
It's almost like you think this should only go one way

05:43.980 --> 05:46.700
because you're an empowered woman and men are oppressors.

05:46.720 --> 05:49.080
It's okay to want your girlfriend to not have dude friends

05:49.080 --> 05:51.160
because, you know, who knows what it could turn into.

05:51.160 --> 05:54.000
No, no, that same logic can then lead to,

05:54.000 --> 05:55.560
well, it's okay to not want your girlfriend

05:55.560 --> 05:56.760
to go out at night without you

05:56.760 --> 05:58.160
because who knows what that could lead to.

05:58.160 --> 06:00.160
You need to trust your partner,

06:00.160 --> 06:02.480
trust your partner and not try to control them.

06:02.480 --> 06:03.840
And this same logic, by the way,

06:03.840 --> 06:06.880
leads to bisexual women being told in abusive relationships

06:06.880 --> 06:08.460
that they can't have any friends

06:08.460 --> 06:10.520
because whether it's a female friend or a male friend,

06:10.520 --> 06:11.600
who knows what that could lead to.

06:11.600 --> 06:15.200
It is so concerning to me that we have come to a point

06:15.220 --> 06:17.620
culturally where people think it's acceptable

06:17.620 --> 06:20.340
to control your partner's friendships.

06:20.340 --> 06:23.800
It is entirely acceptable to have boundaries

06:23.800 --> 06:26.100
with your partner and you know what?

06:26.100 --> 06:28.920
If they don't wanna follow them, they can just leave.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.680
It's not like Jonah was beating this chick

06:31.680 --> 06:33.020
to try to keep her around.

06:33.020 --> 06:35.180
He said, listen, I have certain things that I want.

06:35.180 --> 06:37.420
If you can't do them, that's fine.

06:37.420 --> 06:40.220
No hate against you, just not what I'm looking for.

06:40.220 --> 06:42.780
That's fine, having a standard is okay.

06:42.780 --> 06:45.020
Now, in terms of the thirst traps,

06:45.840 --> 06:48.200
I feel like if you want to be with someone

06:48.200 --> 06:51.120
that values like modesty and that doesn't believe

06:51.120 --> 06:53.360
in posting thirst traps online,

06:53.360 --> 06:55.220
then you should find someone from the get-go

06:55.220 --> 06:56.880
that shares those values with you.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.040
The thing with Jonah Hill is that he literally

06:59.040 --> 07:02.480
was sliding into her DMs, like heart eyeing her photos

07:02.480 --> 07:04.480
of her in a bikini on a surfboard,

07:04.480 --> 07:06.240
which by the way, they were not thirst traps.

07:06.240 --> 07:08.400
She's a professional surfer and they were just photos

07:08.400 --> 07:10.480
of her like existing in a bathing suit.

07:10.480 --> 07:13.600
Existing, fuck this, this person's a fucking retard.

07:13.620 --> 07:16.620
Okay, listen, listen, listen, listen, all right?

07:16.620 --> 07:19.780
It is completely reasonable to like see a hot girl

07:19.780 --> 07:21.540
who posts certain photos of herself.

07:21.540 --> 07:23.620
You're attracted to that, you start dating her.

07:23.620 --> 07:25.780
And then after the relationship gets going,

07:25.780 --> 07:29.420
you're like, hey, listen, about those like pictures

07:29.420 --> 07:31.140
that you're posting, I actually don't want you

07:31.140 --> 07:32.620
to do that anymore now that we're together.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.740
It's like, yes, you can actually do that.

07:34.740 --> 07:35.700
Yes, you can.

07:35.700 --> 07:40.740
It is 100% normal and reasonable for someone to say,

07:40.740 --> 07:42.620
yeah, I know that you acted in a certain way

07:42.640 --> 07:44.760
before we started dating, but now that we're dating,

07:44.760 --> 07:46.560
you can't act that way anymore.

07:46.560 --> 07:50.140
Relationships are necessarily restrictive.

07:50.140 --> 07:52.800
You negotiate the restrictions, but there are restrictions.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.140
You restrict your behavior for the benefit

07:55.140 --> 07:56.560
of your partner and vice versa.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.360
Now he thinks that he has the right to ask her

07:58.360 --> 08:01.420
to delete all those photos and change her entire lifestyle.

08:01.420 --> 08:04.640
So this is some distorted toxic ass thinking.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.840
This is, this is just fucking stupid.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.560
Sorry guys, I got a, I got a halls

08:08.560 --> 08:10.200
in the middle of that one because it was so long

08:10.200 --> 08:12.480
and boring and also I have a sore throat coming on.

08:13.180 --> 08:14.620
But yeah, this is just really fucking dumb.

08:14.620 --> 08:17.260
It's not abusive to ask your girlfriend

08:17.260 --> 08:20.100
to stop posting lewd pictures of herself online,

08:20.100 --> 08:22.140
even if she posted lewd pictures

08:22.140 --> 08:24.040
of herself before you started dating her.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.300
Now you can say that maybe Jonah Hill should have known

08:26.300 --> 08:28.220
what he was getting into, maybe,

08:28.220 --> 08:29.300
but we don't gotta talk about him specifically

08:29.300 --> 08:30.820
because I covered that in a previous video.

08:30.820 --> 08:33.340
In a more general sense, yes, there is a number

08:33.340 --> 08:35.500
of reasonable restrictions that you can introduce

08:35.500 --> 08:37.340
to a partner after you started dating them,

08:37.340 --> 08:38.280
where it's like, yep, you know what?

08:38.280 --> 08:41.380
You did X, Y, Z before I started dating you,

08:41.440 --> 08:44.000
but now that we're dating, you can't do X, Y, Z anymore.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.560
And if those restrictions don't jive with you,

08:45.560 --> 08:47.120
then you leave them and you're not compatible.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.000
But it's not abusive to have restrictions.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.200
That's just not how this works.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.120
These people think that women should just be free

08:52.120 --> 08:53.760
to do anything they want.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.800
I've even heard that like guys complaining

08:55.800 --> 08:57.840
that their girls cheated on them as abusive.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.240
No man, that's a sacrifice of a relationship.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.760
If you can't handle it, don't get in one.

09:02.760 --> 09:05.960
Hey Wendy's boy, wait, what the fuck are you doing?

09:05.960 --> 09:07.440
Just jump into the fish tank?

09:07.440 --> 09:12.440
Oh my God.

09:16.740 --> 09:18.260
Oh, you moron.

09:18.260 --> 09:19.780
You fucking idiot.

09:19.780 --> 09:22.380
The lengths that people will go to to go viral.

09:22.380 --> 09:23.220
That's right.

09:23.220 --> 09:25.620
I want to be known as the guy who wore the Wendy's shirt

09:25.620 --> 09:27.660
and then jumped into the aquarium.

09:27.660 --> 09:28.740
Yeah, I'm that guy.

09:28.740 --> 09:30.220
Guys, follow me on Instagram.

09:30.220 --> 09:31.060
Fuck.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.040
What the fuck?

09:34.460 --> 09:35.300
I'm awake lady.

09:38.420 --> 09:39.260
Okay.

09:41.820 --> 09:42.660
Jesus.

09:49.300 --> 09:51.660
Guys, I feel like at this point,

09:51.660 --> 09:53.940
the joke is on me now, isn't it?

09:53.940 --> 09:57.140
It's like, let's send Dev the dumbest shit we can.

09:57.140 --> 09:59.700
Here's just some random retard

09:59.700 --> 10:01.340
acting like a moron in public.

10:01.340 --> 10:02.320
Let's just send that to Dev

10:02.320 --> 10:04.760
so he can like groan at the state of humanity.

10:04.760 --> 10:06.660
Is that where the show is devolved into?

10:06.680 --> 10:09.960
Okay, kiddos, that was TikTok Tuesday for another week.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.880
Thanks very much for all your contributions.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.000
Thanks for being here.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.320
And yes, new videos coming soon.

10:15.320 --> 10:16.720
They're coming, I promise.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.220
I'm working on them.

10:18.220 --> 10:21.320
You will see the fruits of my labor eventually.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.840
Thanks for sticking with me, guys.

10:22.840 --> 10:25.140
I will see you next time.

10:25.140 --> 10:26.440
Have a good one.

10:26.440 --> 10:27.260
I love you.
