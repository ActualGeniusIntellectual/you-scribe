0	1540	What's up guys, Dev here.
1540	3640	Welcome to TikTok Tuesday once again.
3640	6340	For those of you who actually do watch TikTok Tuesday
6340	8140	and don't skip these videos,
8140	10020	because, I mean, they are kind of trash,
10020	13620	I'm going to give you guys a sneak peek,
13620	16320	a hint at the upcoming content.
16320	19500	I've spent a good chunk of today working on a script
19500	22580	for the Skullgirls censorship controversy.
22580	24260	Now, a lot of channels have talked about this, right?
24260	25740	I think V has talked about it.
25740	27620	Sid Alpha's talked about it.
27620	29140	Affabend's talked about it.
29160	31040	A whole bunch of these culture war channels
31040	33000	have talked about Skullgirls getting censored.
33000	34440	And I figured since I'm trying to work
34440	35920	through some writer's block,
35920	38700	that would be a pretty easy topic for me to tackle.
38700	40420	I'll quickly whip up like a 10 minute video
40420	42080	and put it out and we'll be on our way.
42080	43800	But as I began researching for it,
43800	46360	I found a whole bunch of stuff,
46360	47800	a completely new angle
47800	49720	that most people aren't really talking about.
49720	51000	And I was like, oh my God,
51000	52840	this story goes way further
52840	55640	than just censoring old problematic content
55640	56760	for a modern audience
56760	59000	by a bunch of new woke game developers
59700	60860	who took the IP from the original creators.
60860	61700	No, no, no, no.
61700	62860	That's actually surface level.
62860	64860	My tiny 10 minute script turned
64860	66700	into a Skullgirls deep dive
66700	68900	and that'll be something that you guys will see soon.
68900	70700	But for now, your TikToks.
70700	71540	Let's roll them.
73580	75360	Know your local fascists.
76940	80020	We keep us, is it like publicly available?
81180	82860	Oh, and it's just like everyone's docs.
82860	84460	Okay, let's see what it says here.
84460	87180	A list of prominent bigots transphobes
87180	92180	working to advanced, advanced white Christian nationalism.
92280	93920	You could at least spell check this, you know.
93920	95400	But okay, this group is apparently,
95400	96300	I don't know what city this is,
96300	97640	but they're putting out a booklet
97640	98800	where you can see the people
98800	101360	that they call bigots and transphobes
101360	102500	who live in the area.
102500	104440	This is more of the apprehensible.
104440	107280	This will be used by some extremist as a hit list.
107280	109880	One, who the fuck even says these people
109880	112020	are actually bigots or transphobes
112020	114000	or Christian nationalists?
114000	116680	And two, they shouldn't be randomly attacked
117140	118580	in the street, even if they are.
118580	121340	This is simply a political hit list.
121340	122700	The publishing of this book
122700	125460	should be treated as a call to violence.
125460	127580	Also, I like how the first person they flip to
127580	128780	isn't even a white person.
128780	129700	Good job.
129700	131260	Good job, you fucking retards.
133340	134180	What is this?
137260	138420	Just eating a burger.
141980	144180	Oh, were they like vegan activists or something?
144180	145380	That has to be it, hold on.
145380	146300	Let's watch that again.
146800	147920	He's eating like a chicken burger.
147920	150560	Yeah, they gotta be vegan activists or something
150560	153040	doing this sort of like sit-down protest.
153040	155040	Yeah, look at how this person's looking at him.
155040	156280	It's like, how dare you?
156280	158680	How dare you eat a chicken burger in my vicinity?
158680	159600	That's pretty good.
159600	160960	That's a pretty good troll.
161960	163240	This one's called Portland Core.
163240	164080	Oh, here we go.
165520	166920	This the inside of a subway?
169080	171360	Hey, you left your backpack, sir.
171360	173040	No, I know I did.
173040	174920	Give me my sandwich.
174940	178020	I need you to take your backpack in, please, please.
178020	179740	Give me my sandwich.
180580	183020	Give me my sandwich, bitch.
183020	185780	Give me my sandwich, you fucking bitch.
186780	187860	Do you think he was holding a gun?
187860	188700	Like, yeah, that guy.
188700	190020	Sir, I need you to take yours.
190020	192100	Give me my sandwich, bitch.
192100	192940	Please.
192940	195060	Give me my sandwich, bitch.
195060	196700	Give me my sandwich, bitch.
196700	197820	What the fuck?
197820	199700	Give me my shit, bitch.
199700	200980	That's a knocked over chip display.
200980	203100	Did he knock that over when he was here before?
203120	205360	Okay, take the chips, please leave.
205360	210360	No, I need you to give me my fucking shit, bitch.
210840	211680	Oh my God.
211680	214480	How about that, bitch?
214480	216120	You think I'm stupid?
216120	218040	Drugs, not even once, guys.
218040	219000	Holy shit.
220360	222160	Oh, the cops got him.
222160	225480	What a fucking rude.
226960	228520	Yeah, man, fuck that guy.
228520	230400	Hey, man, like I said in my Portland video,
230400	231640	get the fuck out of there.
231640	233500	Inner city drug users are no joke.
233500	234500	I mean, that guy kind of was.
234500	236020	All he did was knock a few stands over.
236020	238540	That's kind of annoying, but it wasn't really dangerous.
238540	239660	He could have been, I guess,
239660	241180	but he ended up just being a fucking loser.
241180	243240	Still, these people are degenerates.
244900	247100	Oh, another smash and grab.
248740	251580	Looks like they're breaking into a jewelry store this time.
252480	253460	Yeah, yeah.
254540	257140	You got to redistribute the goods to the community, guys.
257140	257960	That's what's going on.
257960	259140	Oh, why'd you turn it sideways, dude?
259140	260480	Come on.
260500	261940	That's what's going on here, though.
261940	264540	It's for the good of the whole community.
264540	266740	This is expropriation, guys.
269940	272300	They need these jewels, you know what I mean?
273380	275620	I hate fucking looting at this point.
275620	277820	I've seen so many goddamn looting videos
277820	280660	and like shop listing videos, Christ.
280660	282100	This can't continue indefinitely.
282100	284280	Like either these stores pull out
284280	287860	and let these places rot or they start having security
287860	289300	or they start having police
289320	291480	and the police got to arrest people who were doing this.
291480	293280	You can't live like this in perpetuity.
293280	295460	Why would companies just keep throwing money
295460	298440	into a pit like this where everything keeps getting stolen?
298440	301880	These people are destroying the social fabric
301880	303560	of the places in which they live.
303560	305120	He's just saying he doesn't want a girl
305120	307600	who has dude friends and posts thirst traps.
307600	308760	Wow, so abusive.
308760	311640	It's wild to me that this has been normalized.
311640	314400	Yes, trying to control who your partner can
314400	315960	and cannot be friends with is controlling
315960	318080	abusive, unacceptable behavior.
318100	319020	In those texts, he was saying,
319020	320820	not only can you not be friends with men,
320820	321980	but you can't be friends with women
321980	323860	that I deem troubled or a bad influence.
323860	325140	Yeah, this is Jonah Hill things, okay.
325140	327340	This is like paternalistic behavior.
327340	329560	Who gives you the right to determine
329560	331780	who your partner gets to be friends with?
331780	333180	Listen, listen, it's part of being
333180	334780	in a fucking relationship, honey.
334780	336580	That's just how it is, you know what?
336580	339020	There are certain restrictions I place on my girlfriend.
339020	342340	There are certain restrictions she places on me in turn.
342340	343980	It's almost like you think this should only go one way
343980	346700	because you're an empowered woman and men are oppressors.
346720	349080	It's okay to want your girlfriend to not have dude friends
349080	351160	because, you know, who knows what it could turn into.
351160	354000	No, no, that same logic can then lead to,
354000	355560	well, it's okay to not want your girlfriend
355560	356760	to go out at night without you
356760	358160	because who knows what that could lead to.
358160	360160	You need to trust your partner,
360160	362480	trust your partner and not try to control them.
362480	363840	And this same logic, by the way,
363840	366880	leads to bisexual women being told in abusive relationships
366880	368460	that they can't have any friends
368460	370520	because whether it's a female friend or a male friend,
370520	371600	who knows what that could lead to.
371600	375200	It is so concerning to me that we have come to a point
375220	377620	culturally where people think it's acceptable
377620	380340	to control your partner's friendships.
380340	383800	It is entirely acceptable to have boundaries
383800	386100	with your partner and you know what?
386100	388920	If they don't wanna follow them, they can just leave.
388920	391680	It's not like Jonah was beating this chick
391680	393020	to try to keep her around.
393020	395180	He said, listen, I have certain things that I want.
395180	397420	If you can't do them, that's fine.
397420	400220	No hate against you, just not what I'm looking for.
400220	402780	That's fine, having a standard is okay.
402780	405020	Now, in terms of the thirst traps,
405840	408200	I feel like if you want to be with someone
408200	411120	that values like modesty and that doesn't believe
411120	413360	in posting thirst traps online,
413360	415220	then you should find someone from the get-go
415220	416880	that shares those values with you.
416880	419040	The thing with Jonah Hill is that he literally
419040	422480	was sliding into her DMs, like heart eyeing her photos
422480	424480	of her in a bikini on a surfboard,
424480	426240	which by the way, they were not thirst traps.
426240	428400	She's a professional surfer and they were just photos
428400	430480	of her like existing in a bathing suit.
430480	433600	Existing, fuck this, this person's a fucking retard.
433620	436620	Okay, listen, listen, listen, listen, all right?
436620	439780	It is completely reasonable to like see a hot girl
439780	441540	who posts certain photos of herself.
441540	443620	You're attracted to that, you start dating her.
443620	445780	And then after the relationship gets going,
445780	449420	you're like, hey, listen, about those like pictures
449420	451140	that you're posting, I actually don't want you
451140	452620	to do that anymore now that we're together.
452620	454740	It's like, yes, you can actually do that.
454740	455700	Yes, you can.
455700	460740	It is 100% normal and reasonable for someone to say,
460740	462620	yeah, I know that you acted in a certain way
462640	464760	before we started dating, but now that we're dating,
464760	466560	you can't act that way anymore.
466560	470140	Relationships are necessarily restrictive.
470140	472800	You negotiate the restrictions, but there are restrictions.
472800	475140	You restrict your behavior for the benefit
475140	476560	of your partner and vice versa.
476560	478360	Now he thinks that he has the right to ask her
478360	481420	to delete all those photos and change her entire lifestyle.
481420	484640	So this is some distorted toxic ass thinking.
484640	486840	This is, this is just fucking stupid.
486840	488560	Sorry guys, I got a, I got a halls
488560	490200	in the middle of that one because it was so long
490200	492480	and boring and also I have a sore throat coming on.
493180	494620	But yeah, this is just really fucking dumb.
494620	497260	It's not abusive to ask your girlfriend
497260	500100	to stop posting lewd pictures of herself online,
500100	502140	even if she posted lewd pictures
502140	504040	of herself before you started dating her.
504040	506300	Now you can say that maybe Jonah Hill should have known
506300	508220	what he was getting into, maybe,
508220	509300	but we don't gotta talk about him specifically
509300	510820	because I covered that in a previous video.
510820	513340	In a more general sense, yes, there is a number
513340	515500	of reasonable restrictions that you can introduce
515500	517340	to a partner after you started dating them,
517340	518280	where it's like, yep, you know what?
518280	521380	You did X, Y, Z before I started dating you,
521440	524000	but now that we're dating, you can't do X, Y, Z anymore.
524000	525560	And if those restrictions don't jive with you,
525560	527120	then you leave them and you're not compatible.
527120	529000	But it's not abusive to have restrictions.
529000	530200	That's just not how this works.
530200	532120	These people think that women should just be free
532120	533760	to do anything they want.
533760	535800	I've even heard that like guys complaining
535800	537840	that their girls cheated on them as abusive.
537840	540240	No man, that's a sacrifice of a relationship.
540240	542760	If you can't handle it, don't get in one.
542760	545960	Hey Wendy's boy, wait, what the fuck are you doing?
545960	547440	Just jump into the fish tank?
547440	552440	Oh my God.
556740	558260	Oh, you moron.
558260	559780	You fucking idiot.
559780	562380	The lengths that people will go to to go viral.
562380	563220	That's right.
563220	565620	I want to be known as the guy who wore the Wendy's shirt
565620	567660	and then jumped into the aquarium.
567660	568740	Yeah, I'm that guy.
568740	570220	Guys, follow me on Instagram.
570220	571060	Fuck.
572200	573040	What the fuck?
574460	575300	I'm awake lady.
578420	579260	Okay.
581820	582660	Jesus.
589300	591660	Guys, I feel like at this point,
591660	593940	the joke is on me now, isn't it?
593940	597140	It's like, let's send Dev the dumbest shit we can.
597140	599700	Here's just some random retard
599700	601340	acting like a moron in public.
601340	602320	Let's just send that to Dev
602320	604760	so he can like groan at the state of humanity.
604760	606660	Is that where the show is devolved into?
606680	609960	Okay, kiddos, that was TikTok Tuesday for another week.
609960	611880	Thanks very much for all your contributions.
611880	613000	Thanks for being here.
613000	615320	And yes, new videos coming soon.
615320	616720	They're coming, I promise.
616720	618220	I'm working on them.
618220	621320	You will see the fruits of my labor eventually.
621320	622840	Thanks for sticking with me, guys.
622840	625140	I will see you next time.
625140	626440	Have a good one.
626440	627260	I love you.
