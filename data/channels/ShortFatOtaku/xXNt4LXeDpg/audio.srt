1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,540
What's up guys, Dev here.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,640
Welcome to TikTok Tuesday once again.

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,340
For those of you who actually do watch TikTok Tuesday

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,140
and don't skip these videos,

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,020
because, I mean, they are kind of trash,

6
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,620
I'm going to give you guys a sneak peek,

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,320
a hint at the upcoming content.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,500
I've spent a good chunk of today working on a script

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,580
for the Skullgirls censorship controversy.

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,260
Now, a lot of channels have talked about this, right?

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,740
I think V has talked about it.

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,620
Sid Alpha's talked about it.

13
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,140
Affabend's talked about it.

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,040
A whole bunch of these culture war channels

15
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,000
have talked about Skullgirls getting censored.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,440
And I figured since I'm trying to work

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,920
through some writer's block,

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,700
that would be a pretty easy topic for me to tackle.

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,420
I'll quickly whip up like a 10 minute video

20
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,080
and put it out and we'll be on our way.

21
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,800
But as I began researching for it,

22
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,360
I found a whole bunch of stuff,

23
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,800
a completely new angle

24
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,720
that most people aren't really talking about.

25
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,000
And I was like, oh my God,

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,840
this story goes way further

27
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,640
than just censoring old problematic content

28
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,760
for a modern audience

29
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,000
by a bunch of new woke game developers

30
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,860
who took the IP from the original creators.

31
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,700
No, no, no, no.

32
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,860
That's actually surface level.

33
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,860
My tiny 10 minute script turned

34
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,700
into a Skullgirls deep dive

35
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,900
and that'll be something that you guys will see soon.

36
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,700
But for now, your TikToks.

37
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,540
Let's roll them.

38
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,360
Know your local fascists.

39
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,020
We keep us, is it like publicly available?

40
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,860
Oh, and it's just like everyone's docs.

41
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,460
Okay, let's see what it says here.

42
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,180
A list of prominent bigots transphobes

43
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,180
working to advanced, advanced white Christian nationalism.

44
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,920
You could at least spell check this, you know.

45
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,400
But okay, this group is apparently,

46
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,300
I don't know what city this is,

47
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,640
but they're putting out a booklet

48
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,800
where you can see the people

49
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,360
that they call bigots and transphobes

50
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,500
who live in the area.

51
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,440
This is more of the apprehensible.

52
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,280
This will be used by some extremist as a hit list.

53
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,880
One, who the fuck even says these people

54
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,020
are actually bigots or transphobes

55
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,000
or Christian nationalists?

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,680
And two, they shouldn't be randomly attacked

57
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,580
in the street, even if they are.

58
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,340
This is simply a political hit list.

59
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,700
The publishing of this book

60
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,460
should be treated as a call to violence.

61
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,580
Also, I like how the first person they flip to

62
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,780
isn't even a white person.

63
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,700
Good job.

64
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,260
Good job, you fucking retards.

65
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,180
What is this?

66
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,420
Just eating a burger.

67
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,180
Oh, were they like vegan activists or something?

68
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,380
That has to be it, hold on.

69
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,300
Let's watch that again.

70
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,920
He's eating like a chicken burger.

71
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,560
Yeah, they gotta be vegan activists or something

72
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,040
doing this sort of like sit-down protest.

73
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,040
Yeah, look at how this person's looking at him.

74
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,280
It's like, how dare you?

75
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,680
How dare you eat a chicken burger in my vicinity?

76
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,600
That's pretty good.

77
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,960
That's a pretty good troll.

78
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,240
This one's called Portland Core.

79
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,080
Oh, here we go.

80
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,920
This the inside of a subway?

81
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,360
Hey, you left your backpack, sir.

82
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,040
No, I know I did.

83
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,920
Give me my sandwich.

84
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,020
I need you to take your backpack in, please, please.

85
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,740
Give me my sandwich.

86
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,020
Give me my sandwich, bitch.

87
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,780
Give me my sandwich, you fucking bitch.

88
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,860
Do you think he was holding a gun?

89
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,700
Like, yeah, that guy.

90
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,020
Sir, I need you to take yours.

91
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,100
Give me my sandwich, bitch.

92
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,940
Please.

93
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,060
Give me my sandwich, bitch.

94
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,700
Give me my sandwich, bitch.

95
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,820
What the fuck?

96
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,700
Give me my shit, bitch.

97
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,980
That's a knocked over chip display.

98
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,100
Did he knock that over when he was here before?

99
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,360
Okay, take the chips, please leave.

100
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,360
No, I need you to give me my fucking shit, bitch.

101
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,680
Oh my God.

102
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,480
How about that, bitch?

103
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,120
You think I'm stupid?

104
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,040
Drugs, not even once, guys.

105
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,000
Holy shit.

106
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,160
Oh, the cops got him.

107
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,480
What a fucking rude.

108
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,520
Yeah, man, fuck that guy.

109
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,400
Hey, man, like I said in my Portland video,

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,640
get the fuck out of there.

111
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,500
Inner city drug users are no joke.

112
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
I mean, that guy kind of was.

113
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,020
All he did was knock a few stands over.

114
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,540
That's kind of annoying, but it wasn't really dangerous.

115
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,660
He could have been, I guess,

116
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,180
but he ended up just being a fucking loser.

117
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,240
Still, these people are degenerates.

118
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,100
Oh, another smash and grab.

119
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,580
Looks like they're breaking into a jewelry store this time.

120
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,460
Yeah, yeah.

121
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,140
You got to redistribute the goods to the community, guys.

122
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,960
That's what's going on.

123
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,140
Oh, why'd you turn it sideways, dude?

124
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,480
Come on.

125
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,940
That's what's going on here, though.

126
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,540
It's for the good of the whole community.

127
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,740
This is expropriation, guys.

128
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,300
They need these jewels, you know what I mean?

129
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,620
I hate fucking looting at this point.

130
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,820
I've seen so many goddamn looting videos

131
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,660
and like shop listing videos, Christ.

132
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,100
This can't continue indefinitely.

133
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,280
Like either these stores pull out

134
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,860
and let these places rot or they start having security

135
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,300
or they start having police

136
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,480
and the police got to arrest people who were doing this.

137
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,280
You can't live like this in perpetuity.

138
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,460
Why would companies just keep throwing money

139
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,440
into a pit like this where everything keeps getting stolen?

140
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,880
These people are destroying the social fabric

141
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,560
of the places in which they live.

142
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,120
He's just saying he doesn't want a girl

143
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,600
who has dude friends and posts thirst traps.

144
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,760
Wow, so abusive.

145
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,640
It's wild to me that this has been normalized.

146
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,400
Yes, trying to control who your partner can

147
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,960
and cannot be friends with is controlling

148
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,080
abusive, unacceptable behavior.

149
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,020
In those texts, he was saying,

150
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,820
not only can you not be friends with men,

151
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,980
but you can't be friends with women

152
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,860
that I deem troubled or a bad influence.

153
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,140
Yeah, this is Jonah Hill things, okay.

154
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,340
This is like paternalistic behavior.

155
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,560
Who gives you the right to determine

156
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,780
who your partner gets to be friends with?

157
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,180
Listen, listen, it's part of being

158
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,780
in a fucking relationship, honey.

159
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,580
That's just how it is, you know what?

160
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,020
There are certain restrictions I place on my girlfriend.

161
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,340
There are certain restrictions she places on me in turn.

162
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,980
It's almost like you think this should only go one way

163
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,700
because you're an empowered woman and men are oppressors.

164
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,080
It's okay to want your girlfriend to not have dude friends

165
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,160
because, you know, who knows what it could turn into.

166
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,000
No, no, that same logic can then lead to,

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,560
well, it's okay to not want your girlfriend

168
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,760
to go out at night without you

169
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,160
because who knows what that could lead to.

170
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,160
You need to trust your partner,

171
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,480
trust your partner and not try to control them.

172
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,840
And this same logic, by the way,

173
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,880
leads to bisexual women being told in abusive relationships

174
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,460
that they can't have any friends

175
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,520
because whether it's a female friend or a male friend,

176
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,600
who knows what that could lead to.

177
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,200
It is so concerning to me that we have come to a point

178
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,620
culturally where people think it's acceptable

179
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,340
to control your partner's friendships.

180
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,800
It is entirely acceptable to have boundaries

181
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,100
with your partner and you know what?

182
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,920
If they don't wanna follow them, they can just leave.

183
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,680
It's not like Jonah was beating this chick

184
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,020
to try to keep her around.

185
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,180
He said, listen, I have certain things that I want.

186
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,420
If you can't do them, that's fine.

187
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,220
No hate against you, just not what I'm looking for.

188
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,780
That's fine, having a standard is okay.

189
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,020
Now, in terms of the thirst traps,

190
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,200
I feel like if you want to be with someone

191
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,120
that values like modesty and that doesn't believe

192
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,360
in posting thirst traps online,

193
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,220
then you should find someone from the get-go

194
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,880
that shares those values with you.

195
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,040
The thing with Jonah Hill is that he literally

196
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,480
was sliding into her DMs, like heart eyeing her photos

197
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
of her in a bikini on a surfboard,

198
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,240
which by the way, they were not thirst traps.

199
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,400
She's a professional surfer and they were just photos

200
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,480
of her like existing in a bathing suit.

201
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,600
Existing, fuck this, this person's a fucking retard.

202
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,620
Okay, listen, listen, listen, listen, all right?

203
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,780
It is completely reasonable to like see a hot girl

204
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,540
who posts certain photos of herself.

205
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,620
You're attracted to that, you start dating her.

206
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,780
And then after the relationship gets going,

207
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,420
you're like, hey, listen, about those like pictures

208
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,140
that you're posting, I actually don't want you

209
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,620
to do that anymore now that we're together.

210
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,740
It's like, yes, you can actually do that.

211
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,700
Yes, you can.

212
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,740
It is 100% normal and reasonable for someone to say,

213
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,620
yeah, I know that you acted in a certain way

214
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,760
before we started dating, but now that we're dating,

215
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,560
you can't act that way anymore.

216
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,140
Relationships are necessarily restrictive.

217
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,800
You negotiate the restrictions, but there are restrictions.

218
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,140
You restrict your behavior for the benefit

219
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,560
of your partner and vice versa.

220
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,360
Now he thinks that he has the right to ask her

221
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,420
to delete all those photos and change her entire lifestyle.

222
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,640
So this is some distorted toxic ass thinking.

223
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,840
This is, this is just fucking stupid.

224
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,560
Sorry guys, I got a, I got a halls

225
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,200
in the middle of that one because it was so long

226
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,480
and boring and also I have a sore throat coming on.

227
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,620
But yeah, this is just really fucking dumb.

228
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,260
It's not abusive to ask your girlfriend

229
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,100
to stop posting lewd pictures of herself online,

230
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,140
even if she posted lewd pictures

231
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,040
of herself before you started dating her.

232
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,300
Now you can say that maybe Jonah Hill should have known

233
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,220
what he was getting into, maybe,

234
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,300
but we don't gotta talk about him specifically

235
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,820
because I covered that in a previous video.

236
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,340
In a more general sense, yes, there is a number

237
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,500
of reasonable restrictions that you can introduce

238
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,340
to a partner after you started dating them,

239
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,280
where it's like, yep, you know what?

240
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,380
You did X, Y, Z before I started dating you,

241
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,000
but now that we're dating, you can't do X, Y, Z anymore.

242
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,560
And if those restrictions don't jive with you,

243
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,120
then you leave them and you're not compatible.

244
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,000
But it's not abusive to have restrictions.

245
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
That's just not how this works.

246
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,120
These people think that women should just be free

247
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,760
to do anything they want.

248
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,800
I've even heard that like guys complaining

249
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,840
that their girls cheated on them as abusive.

250
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,240
No man, that's a sacrifice of a relationship.

251
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,760
If you can't handle it, don't get in one.

252
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,960
Hey Wendy's boy, wait, what the fuck are you doing?

253
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,440
Just jump into the fish tank?

254
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Oh my God.

255
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,260
Oh, you moron.

256
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,780
You fucking idiot.

257
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,380
The lengths that people will go to to go viral.

258
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,220
That's right.

259
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,620
I want to be known as the guy who wore the Wendy's shirt

260
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,660
and then jumped into the aquarium.

261
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,740
Yeah, I'm that guy.

262
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,220
Guys, follow me on Instagram.

263
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,060
Fuck.

264
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,040
What the fuck?

265
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,300
I'm awake lady.

266
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,260
Okay.

267
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,660
Jesus.

268
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,660
Guys, I feel like at this point,

269
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,940
the joke is on me now, isn't it?

270
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,140
It's like, let's send Dev the dumbest shit we can.

271
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,700
Here's just some random retard

272
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,340
acting like a moron in public.

273
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,320
Let's just send that to Dev

274
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,760
so he can like groan at the state of humanity.

275
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,660
Is that where the show is devolved into?

276
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,960
Okay, kiddos, that was TikTok Tuesday for another week.

277
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,880
Thanks very much for all your contributions.

278
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,000
Thanks for being here.

279
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,320
And yes, new videos coming soon.

280
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,720
They're coming, I promise.

281
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,220
I'm working on them.

282
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,320
You will see the fruits of my labor eventually.

283
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,840
Thanks for sticking with me, guys.

284
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,140
I will see you next time.

285
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,440
Have a good one.

286
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,260
I love you.
