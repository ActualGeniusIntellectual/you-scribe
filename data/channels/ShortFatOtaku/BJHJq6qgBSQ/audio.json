You only get to do this even one time, you know You know, I don't think you get to slash anyone's tires any time in your life I guess the the whole like be destructive self-destructive abuse your partners throw things break things That's something you're supposed to grow to by the time you're 30 now see personally I thought you're supposed to go to that by the time you're five years old Enjoy your toxic 20s. I guess don't date anyone till they're 30 years old guys Oh shit delivery robots under attack don't invest in this company. Look it is watch this Yeah, he's just robbing it and no one cares Oh You can't have like delivery robots going around in a place like this for no one man look at Somebody knock them over who is it? It's Austin. They steal your food, too Oh Just sitting on it doesn't give a shit I Know I know everyone has like this vision of the future where you know robots are zipping around delivering packages You know like it's no big deal You know Amazon drones fly over to your front porch and drop the package off and fly away that vision of the future You see it a lot in sci-fi that might work in a high trust society, right? Where no one's gonna just rob the delivery robot but man like that looked like it was happening in LA or San Francisco Or something and I guarantee you there's gonna be like homeless people or crackheads or whatever They're gonna just rob the shit out of they don't care. They'll just tip it over take it there Well, you know if a drone like flies or head little shoot it down throw a rock at it And this isn't just like some sort of inner-city, you know druggie thing Imagine like an Amazon delivery drone flying over like Alabama or Arkansas or something, right? Yeah like a bunch of poor people living there and they just like it's like that it's like that picture that you see go viral a Lot of the people throwing their empty beer cans at a drone watching them Like I think imagine some redneck family sees a drone flying by carrying a package He's gonna knock out of the sky and they got the package, you know, as long as American society remains relatively low trust It's not as low trust as some crazy ones But like it's slower than other liberal democracies as long as America remains like that This whole automated delivery system isn't gonna work get ready with me today for therapy My best I'm gonna need therapy after watching this Gee, okay.
