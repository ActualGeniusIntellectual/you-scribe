Hello and welcome to another tick-tock Tuesday this time on Thursday once again

00:05.740 --> 00:09.780
Unfortunately, listen, I had to get that super mega video out. I hope you guys enjoyed it

00:10.100 --> 00:17.820
Apparently it made waves because uh while it was premiering guess what the girl in question Lex up dog. Yeah, she blocked me

00:18.360 --> 00:21.560
She blocked me while it was premiering so that came out on Tuesday

00:21.560 --> 00:22.660
I wanted to get it as soon as possible

00:22.660 --> 00:24.580
If you haven't seen it go back and watch it

00:24.580 --> 00:29.380
But for now, let's check out what tick-tock nonsense you guys have sent to me

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Hey ladies, how are you?

00:32.000 --> 00:33.120
Hey girl

00:33.120 --> 00:36.020
Call my twin and I just want to let y'all know

00:36.480 --> 00:41.560
Be toxic for the rest of your 20s. You only get one life be toxic toxic 20s

00:41.560 --> 00:44.760
You never get to be 20 years old the toxic 20s guys

00:46.760 --> 00:53.300
Be toxic cuz don't get in your 30s thinking you could just go slashing tires and doing all this crazy shit you two

00:54.020 --> 01:00.060
Slashing tires be toxic for the rest of your 20s and if you delusional turn it shit up a notch

01:01.540 --> 01:06.160
What are you doing? You only get to do this even one time, you know

01:08.420 --> 01:12.940
You know, I don't think you get to slash anyone's tires any time in your life

01:12.940 --> 01:19.940
I guess the the whole like be destructive self-destructive abuse your partners throw things break things

01:20.140 --> 01:23.860
That's something you're supposed to grow to by the time you're 30 now see personally

01:23.860 --> 01:26.400
I thought you're supposed to go to that by the time you're five years old

01:27.420 --> 01:33.660
Enjoy your toxic 20s. I guess don't date anyone till they're 30 years old guys

01:33.660 --> 01:39.460
Oh shit delivery robots under attack don't invest in this company. Look it is watch this

01:45.380 --> 01:48.640
Yeah, he's just robbing it and no one cares

01:49.940 --> 01:51.940
Oh

01:54.540 --> 02:00.100
You can't have like delivery robots going around in a place like this for no one man look at

02:03.780 --> 02:10.660
Somebody knock them over who is it? It's Austin. They steal your food, too

02:10.660 --> 02:12.660
Oh

02:19.020 --> 02:21.020
Just sitting on it doesn't give a shit

02:40.660 --> 02:42.660
I

02:45.380 --> 02:51.180
Know I know everyone has like this vision of the future where you know robots are zipping around delivering packages

02:51.180 --> 02:52.700
You know like it's no big deal

02:52.700 --> 02:59.060
You know Amazon drones fly over to your front porch and drop the package off and fly away that vision of the future

02:59.380 --> 03:03.820
You see it a lot in sci-fi that might work in a high trust society, right?

03:03.980 --> 03:10.460
Where no one's gonna just rob the delivery robot but man like that looked like it was happening in LA or San Francisco

03:10.660 --> 03:15.820
Or something and I guarantee you there's gonna be like homeless people or crackheads or whatever

03:15.820 --> 03:19.060
They're gonna just rob the shit out of they don't care. They'll just tip it over take it there

03:19.060 --> 03:22.400
Well, you know if a drone like flies or head little shoot it down throw a rock at it

03:22.400 --> 03:25.820
And this isn't just like some sort of inner-city, you know druggie thing

03:25.980 --> 03:32.740
Imagine like an Amazon delivery drone flying over like Alabama or Arkansas or something, right?

03:32.740 --> 03:33.100
Yeah

03:33.100 --> 03:38.220
like a bunch of poor people living there and they just like it's like that it's like that picture that you see go viral a

03:38.220 --> 03:42.180
Lot of the people throwing their empty beer cans at a drone watching them

03:42.180 --> 03:47.260
Like I think imagine some redneck family sees a drone flying by carrying a package

03:47.260 --> 03:52.700
He's gonna knock out of the sky and they got the package, you know, as long as American society remains relatively low trust

03:52.860 --> 03:54.900
It's not as low trust as some crazy ones

03:54.900 --> 03:58.460
But like it's slower than other liberal democracies as long as America remains like that

03:58.660 --> 04:04.020
This whole automated delivery system isn't gonna work get ready with me today for therapy

04:04.420 --> 04:06.420
My best

04:07.580 --> 04:10.660
I'm gonna need therapy after watching this

04:11.180 --> 04:14.620
Gee, okay. That's that's restart. Let's give her the benefit of the doubt

04:15.660 --> 04:18.620
Hey, what does it say backwards use a condom? Oh

04:19.420 --> 04:26.060
Okay, I mean if it prevents making more people like you sure get ready with me today for therapy

04:26.060 --> 04:29.160
Okay, my best makes me feel my best when I go to therapy

04:29.160 --> 04:35.440
So I'm going to style this super cute bow mini dress. Okay, here is the dress on and of course

04:35.440 --> 04:38.340
I'm not just gonna wear it like this. So let's style it

04:38.340 --> 04:45.080
I think these ruffle bloomer shorts underneath going to add this tiered skirt my croc earrings

04:45.160 --> 04:48.800
Of course, I had my bow accessories. Oh my god

04:49.200 --> 04:54.000
So I put one in my hair know what I'm going to add my cheetah tutu as well

04:54.000 --> 04:57.480
I think this little bustier bag is gonna be perfect

04:58.480 --> 05:04.940
My therapist in my Moschino blow-up wedges red frames to complement my makeup

05:05.200 --> 05:13.020
Here is my final look for therapy. Oh my gosh, it's so fun. She looks like she fucking needs it, doesn't she?

05:14.880 --> 05:18.180
I think I'm ready to slay my therapy session

05:19.180 --> 05:23.840
Remember baddies go to therapy to love you all this has to be a troll

05:23.840 --> 05:29.140
Like I can't believe this person's actually doing this like she has to be playing a fucking character or something

05:29.140 --> 05:32.540
Oh my god, like I was thinking she might have been like a professional clown

05:32.580 --> 05:36.440
Maybe any of you think you can fix her post in the comments. I can fix her

05:36.840 --> 05:41.840
No, no one can fix her do not even that fucking therapy can fix her think it's okay to transition children

05:42.600 --> 05:44.600
To Christianity

05:47.680 --> 05:53.560
Like I know that they don't care what the double standard or the hypocrisy they simply want what they want and that's that but it

05:53.560 --> 05:57.280
Is always, you know cathartic to see to see them just come out and say it, you know

05:59.040 --> 06:01.760
Whoa, she owes me. Oh I

06:02.840 --> 06:09.140
Was discriminated against twice tonight in less than two hours anti-demon action here guys

06:12.160 --> 06:17.140
Holy shit, let me explain while I take off the makeup that

06:18.080 --> 06:21.700
Let's hear about it. I covered myself and to appease

06:22.400 --> 06:24.360
the public I

06:24.360 --> 06:27.160
To get hired at jobs that I really don't even want

06:27.900 --> 06:29.900
Really, dude

06:30.000 --> 06:32.160
It's just something for me to get out of the house, you know

06:42.620 --> 06:44.620
Okay, that had to be an act all right

06:44.920 --> 06:48.400
Like okay. Okay. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on

06:48.400 --> 06:52.360
My brain's melting a little bit that one had to be an act like another clown lady

06:52.360 --> 06:54.780
I was like on the fence that I know I don't believe this

06:54.780 --> 06:55.960
I was like

06:55.960 --> 07:01.480
Believing that this person was real up until they're like I'm gonna take my makeup off and like a bunch of black sludge poured out

07:01.480 --> 07:07.420
Of their head. No, I don't believe in real demons. All right, I don't believe in this shit. That's a no I refuse

07:11.840 --> 07:13.840
You

07:14.280 --> 07:17.200
Know there's a whole continent of non-whites

07:18.240 --> 07:23.600
We're back at woke segregation. We're there. All right. Listen, listen, it's okay, dude. It's okay

07:23.600 --> 07:29.640

07:29.640 --> 07:31.600
We'll give you your own water fountains

If that's what you want, like how far back do you want to fucking go lady?

07:34.040 --> 07:35.360
These people are just racists

07:35.360 --> 07:35.800
All right

07:35.800 --> 07:38.160
Black lives matter is fucking racist all these race

07:38.440 --> 07:44.320
Agitators doesn't matter if they're like pro white or pro black doesn't matter. They're all fucking racists and you see me getting jumped

07:45.080 --> 07:47.000
What are you gonna do?

07:47.000 --> 07:54.280
In the moment probably point and laugh that shit's funny a cab but later that night. I mean good

07:54.280 --> 07:56.280
I'm having some pulled pork sandwiches

07:56.320 --> 07:58.320
Okay. All right

07:58.480 --> 08:03.160
Is it is that is it because it's a cop and you know pig pork like is that what you're doing?

08:03.160 --> 08:04.720
Are you literally gonna eat the police?

08:04.720 --> 08:10.420
I feel like it's a spongebob comic where this chick comes up and is like a cab and then you know Squidward's like

08:10.600 --> 08:16.320
Feeling daring today are we being anti cop is the most safe edgy bullshit. I've seen in my fucking life guys

08:16.320 --> 08:22.360
I'm literally shaking right now. I was just getting groceries and I live in San Francisco and I never really feel fully safe

08:22.600 --> 08:26.800
Why are you there? I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. And I just got groceries

08:26.800 --> 08:27.000
Yeah

08:27.000 --> 08:30.200

08:30.440 --> 08:34.640
Says move you stupid bitch and he spits in my face, but all over my face

08:34.640 --> 08:39.640
What do I say? Excuse me? Did you just spit in my face and he says move or I'll rape you

08:40.600 --> 08:46.120
People everywhere and everyone's just walking by because they're like, I can't handle something else in San Francisco. It's always something else

08:46.120 --> 08:50.840
I don't know even know I'm posting this just leave let's go. Do you feel this way all the time?

08:50.840 --> 08:56.440

08:56.640 --> 09:00.440
Yeah, what are you living here man, okay, listen listen, all right

09:00.440 --> 09:05.820
I've spent some time in Toronto and I never feel safe in Toronto. I feel like every single fucking person

09:05.820 --> 09:11.360
There's what a mug me. Okay, so fair enough. I get it. All right, but I've been to like other cities in Canada

09:11.360 --> 09:12.840
I've been in places in the United States

09:12.840 --> 09:18.720
I've been to other places and like no even in like larger Canadian cities or whatever. I feel like reasonably safe

09:18.720 --> 09:25.240
There's like a select few shitholes where it just seems like the entire city is hostile like it's out to get you

09:25.240 --> 09:32.000
All right, LA San Francisco definitely like that New York definitely like that Toronto definitely like that London definitely like that

09:32.000 --> 09:33.320
My sister used to live in London

09:33.320 --> 09:39.200
She's like yeah hundred percent go to a mid-sized city if you want somewhere that still has like the amenities and like the the cult

09:39.200 --> 09:43.600
The culture and and the the social aspect of living in a large city go to a mid-sized city

09:43.600 --> 09:48.040
Don't go to Portland. No Portland that city don't go to Portland. But like there are other mid-sized cities you can go to

09:48.040 --> 09:54.120
It'll be okay, you know, especially in Canada Ottawa Montreal Vancouver, Halifax. These are decent places in Canada

09:54.120 --> 09:58.500
You can live that aren't just like a Toronto Ian shithole full of like

09:59.280 --> 10:04.940
Non-integrative immigrants and just crime and just disgusting like filth everywhere or some cities you can go to that are nice

10:05.000 --> 10:09.440
But the biggest ones they're all like trash and get the fuck out of California guys
