Unfortunately, listen, I had to get that super mega video out. I hope you guys enjoyed it

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:17,820
Apparently it made waves because uh while it was premiering guess what the girl in question Lex up dog. Yeah, she blocked me

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,560
She blocked me while it was premiering so that came out on Tuesday

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,660
I wanted to get it as soon as possible

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,580
If you haven't seen it go back and watch it

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,380
But for now, let's check out what tick-tock nonsense you guys have sent to me

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,120
Hey girl

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,020
Call my twin and I just want to let y'all know

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,560
Be toxic for the rest of your 20s. You only get one life be toxic toxic 20s

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,760
You never get to be 20 years old the toxic 20s guys

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:53,300
Be toxic cuz don't get in your 30s thinking you could just go slashing tires and doing all this crazy shit you two

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:00,060
Slashing tires be toxic for the rest of your 20s and if you delusional turn it shit up a notch

15
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,160
What are you doing? You only get to do this even one time, you know

16
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,940
You know, I don't think you get to slash anyone's tires any time in your life

17
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:19,940
I guess the the whole like be destructive self-destructive abuse your partners throw things break things

18
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,860
That's something you're supposed to grow to by the time you're 30 now see personally

19
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,400
I thought you're supposed to go to that by the time you're five years old

20
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,660
Enjoy your toxic 20s. I guess don't date anyone till they're 30 years old guys

21
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:39,460
Oh shit delivery robots under attack don't invest in this company. Look it is watch this

22
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,640
Yeah, he's just robbing it and no one cares

23
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,940
Oh

24
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,100
You can't have like delivery robots going around in a place like this for no one man look at

25
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,660
Somebody knock them over who is it? It's Austin. They steal your food, too

26
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,660
Oh

27
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,020
Just sitting on it doesn't give a shit

28
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,660
I

29
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:51,180
Know I know everyone has like this vision of the future where you know robots are zipping around delivering packages

30
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,700
You know like it's no big deal

31
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:59,060
You know Amazon drones fly over to your front porch and drop the package off and fly away that vision of the future

32
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,820
You see it a lot in sci-fi that might work in a high trust society, right?

33
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:10,460
Where no one's gonna just rob the delivery robot but man like that looked like it was happening in LA or San Francisco

34
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,820
Or something and I guarantee you there's gonna be like homeless people or crackheads or whatever

35
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,060
They're gonna just rob the shit out of they don't care. They'll just tip it over take it there

36
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,400
Well, you know if a drone like flies or head little shoot it down throw a rock at it

37
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,820
And this isn't just like some sort of inner-city, you know druggie thing

38
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:32,740
Imagine like an Amazon delivery drone flying over like Alabama or Arkansas or something, right?

39
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,100
Yeah

40
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:38,220
like a bunch of poor people living there and they just like it's like that it's like that picture that you see go viral a

41
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,180
Lot of the people throwing their empty beer cans at a drone watching them

42
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,260
Like I think imagine some redneck family sees a drone flying by carrying a package

43
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,700
He's gonna knock out of the sky and they got the package, you know, as long as American society remains relatively low trust

44
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,900
It's not as low trust as some crazy ones

45
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,460
But like it's slower than other liberal democracies as long as America remains like that

46
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:04,020
This whole automated delivery system isn't gonna work get ready with me today for therapy

47
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,420
My best

48
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,660
I'm gonna need therapy after watching this

49
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,620
Gee, okay. That's that's restart. Let's give her the benefit of the doubt

50
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,620
Hey, what does it say backwards use a condom? Oh

51
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:26,060
Okay, I mean if it prevents making more people like you sure get ready with me today for therapy

52
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,160
Okay, my best makes me feel my best when I go to therapy

53
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,440
So I'm going to style this super cute bow mini dress. Okay, here is the dress on and of course

54
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,340
I'm not just gonna wear it like this. So let's style it

55
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:45,080
I think these ruffle bloomer shorts underneath going to add this tiered skirt my croc earrings

56
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,800
Of course, I had my bow accessories. Oh my god

57
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,000
So I put one in my hair know what I'm going to add my cheetah tutu as well

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,480
I think this little bustier bag is gonna be perfect

59
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:04,940
My therapist in my Moschino blow-up wedges red frames to complement my makeup

60
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:13,020
Here is my final look for therapy. Oh my gosh, it's so fun. She looks like she fucking needs it, doesn't she?

61
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,180
I think I'm ready to slay my therapy session

62
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,840
Remember baddies go to therapy to love you all this has to be a troll

63
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,140
Like I can't believe this person's actually doing this like she has to be playing a fucking character or something

64
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,540
Oh my god, like I was thinking she might have been like a professional clown

65
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,440
Maybe any of you think you can fix her post in the comments. I can fix her

66
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,840
No, no one can fix her do not even that fucking therapy can fix her think it's okay to transition children

67
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
To Christianity

68
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,560
Like I know that they don't care what the double standard or the hypocrisy they simply want what they want and that's that but it

69
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,280
Is always, you know cathartic to see to see them just come out and say it, you know

70
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,760
Whoa, she owes me. Oh I

71
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,140
Was discriminated against twice tonight in less than two hours anti-demon action here guys

72
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,140
Holy shit, let me explain while I take off the makeup that

73
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,700
Let's hear about it. I covered myself and to appease

74
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,360
the public I

75
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,160
To get hired at jobs that I really don't even want

76
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,900
Really, dude

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,160
It's just something for me to get out of the house, you know

78
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,620
Okay, that had to be an act all right

79
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,400
Like okay. Okay. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on

80
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,360
My brain's melting a little bit that one had to be an act like another clown lady

81
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,780
I was like on the fence that I know I don't believe this

82
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,960
I was like

83
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,480
Believing that this person was real up until they're like I'm gonna take my makeup off and like a bunch of black sludge poured out

84
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,420
Of their head. No, I don't believe in real demons. All right, I don't believe in this shit. That's a no I refuse

85
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,840
You

86
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,200
Know there's a whole continent of non-whites

87
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,600
We're back at woke segregation. We're there. All right. Listen, listen, it's okay, dude. It's okay

88
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,640
Listen, we'll totally provide you with your own entrances into businesses. We'll give you your own change rooms your own swimming pools

89
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,600
We'll give you your own water fountains

90
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,040
If that's what you want, like how far back do you want to fucking go lady?

91
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,360
These people are just racists

92
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,800
All right

93
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,160
Black lives matter is fucking racist all these race

94
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,320
Agitators doesn't matter if they're like pro white or pro black doesn't matter. They're all fucking racists and you see me getting jumped

95
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,000
What are you gonna do?

96
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,280
In the moment probably point and laugh that shit's funny a cab but later that night. I mean good

97
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,280
I'm having some pulled pork sandwiches

98
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,320
Okay. All right

99
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,160
Is it is that is it because it's a cop and you know pig pork like is that what you're doing?

100
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,720
Are you literally gonna eat the police?

101
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,420
I feel like it's a spongebob comic where this chick comes up and is like a cab and then you know Squidward's like

102
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:16,320
Feeling daring today are we being anti cop is the most safe edgy bullshit. I've seen in my fucking life guys

103
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:22,360
I'm literally shaking right now. I was just getting groceries and I live in San Francisco and I never really feel fully safe

104
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,800
Why are you there? I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. And I just got groceries

105
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah

106
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,200
literal shitting streets and this guy is walking past me and

107
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,640
Says move you stupid bitch and he spits in my face, but all over my face

108
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,640
What do I say? Excuse me? Did you just spit in my face and he says move or I'll rape you

109
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:46,120
People everywhere and everyone's just walking by because they're like, I can't handle something else in San Francisco. It's always something else

110
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,840
I don't know even know I'm posting this just leave let's go. Do you feel this way all the time?

111
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,440
I don't feel safe ever. I literally never feel safe. We just stay late but nighttime. No not leaving my house

112
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,440
Yeah, what are you living here man, okay, listen listen, all right

113
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,820
I've spent some time in Toronto and I never feel safe in Toronto. I feel like every single fucking person

114
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:11,360
There's what a mug me. Okay, so fair enough. I get it. All right, but I've been to like other cities in Canada

115
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,840
I've been in places in the United States

116
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:18,720
I've been to other places and like no even in like larger Canadian cities or whatever. I feel like reasonably safe

117
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,240
There's like a select few shitholes where it just seems like the entire city is hostile like it's out to get you

118
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:32,000
All right, LA San Francisco definitely like that New York definitely like that Toronto definitely like that London definitely like that

119
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,320
My sister used to live in London

120
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,200
She's like yeah hundred percent go to a mid-sized city if you want somewhere that still has like the amenities and like the the cult

121
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,600
The culture and and the the social aspect of living in a large city go to a mid-sized city

122
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,040
Don't go to Portland. No Portland that city don't go to Portland. But like there are other mid-sized cities you can go to

123
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,120
It'll be okay, you know, especially in Canada Ottawa Montreal Vancouver, Halifax. These are decent places in Canada

124
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,500
You can live that aren't just like a Toronto Ian shithole full of like

125
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,940
Non-integrative immigrants and just crime and just disgusting like filth everywhere or some cities you can go to that are nice

126
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,440
But the biggest ones they're all like trash and get the fuck out of California guys

127
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,080
If you're if you're listening to me, you're in California get the fuck out of California

128
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,720
