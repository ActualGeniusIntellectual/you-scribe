00:00.000 --> 00:04.380
So I've been working on a long-form Bolsonaro video, and in gathering up various sources

00:04.380 --> 00:08.780
and articles and tweets, I've noticed a trend developing among both the radical left

00:08.780 --> 00:13.200
and the alt-right, though the radical left seems to be currently the larger culprit.

00:13.200 --> 00:17.460
Why is there so much hatred towards people who consider themselves centrists or classical

00:17.460 --> 00:18.460
liberals?

00:18.460 --> 00:23.540
Here's Margo Pez, the founder of Esther, a Patreon alternative that sees Patreon somehow

00:23.540 --> 00:28.380
as far-right, and bills themselves as a progressive, lefty alternative.

00:28.380 --> 00:32.740
Wondering what happened to SubscribeStar, I hope nobody with the wrong opinions signs

00:32.740 --> 00:33.740
up to your service.

00:33.740 --> 00:38.740
I'm not a fan of the centrist fanbase Beto has, but I support his call for an end to

00:38.740 --> 00:39.860
this unjust system.

00:39.860 --> 00:44.500
She's talking about Beto O'Rourke, the center-left option currently filling the Democratic

00:44.500 --> 00:47.820
Party's power vacuum after the collapse of the Clinton machine.

00:47.820 --> 00:52.280
The fact that he's explicitly not a radical seems to be what Margo's complaining about.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.420
And what about Kyle Kalinske on the same topic?

00:54.420 --> 00:58.420
Beto apologized to Ted Cruz for saying that Lion Ted was an accurate nickname, and he

00:58.420 --> 01:00.460
livestreamed himself at the dentist.

01:00.460 --> 01:04.860
Even putting his super-centrist voting record aside, I don't think he'll be the Democratic

01:04.860 --> 01:05.860
nominee.

01:05.860 --> 01:07.540
Why is his centrist voting record a problem?

01:07.540 --> 01:11.020
Surely that would mean he has an ability to meet his opponents in the middle and compromise

01:11.020 --> 01:12.860
in order to get real work done, right?

01:12.860 --> 01:18.140
Here's a tweet from Anarkofak, a disabled trans woman libertarian socialist YouTuber

01:18.140 --> 01:20.340
who's trying to spread radical theory.

01:20.340 --> 01:22.860
I'm surprised there's no pronouns in that bio.

01:22.860 --> 01:25.740
Universities are not full of radical leftists.

01:25.740 --> 01:28.620
They're overwhelmingly full of liberal centrists.

01:28.620 --> 01:32.840
People on the right are just so reactionary that they mistake the mild progressivism of

01:32.840 --> 01:37.500
liberal centrists, such as supporting LGBTQ rights, as radical leftism.

01:37.500 --> 01:42.820
I think by your own self-identification, you are not an accurate judge of what is and isn't

01:42.820 --> 01:44.180
a radical leftist.

01:44.180 --> 01:49.420
And at the expense of exposing myself, and by extension you, as an old person, simply

01:49.420 --> 01:54.980
supporting LGBTQ rights is what your average university student did 15 years ago, back

01:54.980 --> 01:57.420
when I was at university for the first time.

01:57.420 --> 02:02.060
And there were a small minority of religious conservatives, ever shrinking, ever outraged

02:02.060 --> 02:04.500
at the on-campus support for the gays.

02:04.500 --> 02:07.100
But as I said, that was 15 years back.

02:07.100 --> 02:10.240
Canada and the US have since legalized gay marriage.

02:10.240 --> 02:15.040
Legal roadblocks for LGBTQ people are either gone or in the process of disappearing.

02:15.040 --> 02:19.680
We supported those rights back then because there was a need for legislative change.

02:19.680 --> 02:20.680
But now?

02:20.680 --> 02:22.920
The activist class was faced with a choice.

02:22.920 --> 02:27.800
Either shut down and disperse, or lurch ever more radically to the left in order to invent

02:27.800 --> 02:30.680
new causes to continually justify their existence.

02:30.680 --> 02:34.920
And whenever you lurch more left, centrists start to look an awful lot like the far right

02:34.920 --> 02:35.920
that you hate.

02:35.920 --> 02:39.880
I've had those three tweets linked to me by viewers of the channel, but just for fun's

02:39.880 --> 02:43.420
sake, let's do a quick scroll through the use of the word centrist on Twitter right

02:43.420 --> 02:45.100
now and see what we can find.

02:45.100 --> 02:48.500
Pretty cool how the only way this shutdown doesn't end with the complete political

02:48.500 --> 02:53.500
annihilation of Trump and the Republican party is if a lazy corporate centrist media skews

02:53.500 --> 02:57.160
the narrative into somehow being the Democrats' fault for not compromising and that's exactly

02:57.160 --> 02:58.160
what we're seeing.

02:58.160 --> 03:01.780
The media's been lurching left along with the SJWs, but I guess since they're not

03:01.780 --> 03:04.500
keeping pace, they're centrists now, eh?

03:04.500 --> 03:07.340
I only take criticism from Marxist feminists.

03:07.340 --> 03:11.340
I truly don't give a fuck about some centrist liberal's opinion, especially not through

03:11.340 --> 03:12.520
CC.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.520
After all, liberals get the bullet too.

03:14.520 --> 03:17.960
This isn't fact checking, it's a weird centrist mind exercise.

03:17.960 --> 03:21.240
This is in response to a fact check of a recent Donald Trump speech.

03:21.240 --> 03:23.920
It wasn't all good for Trump, but it was worse for the Dems.

03:23.920 --> 03:30.240
As it turns out, pesky things like truth and facts qualify as a weird centrist mind exercise.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.440
Responsible centrist.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.600
What about apartheid?

03:32.600 --> 03:37.480
The fact that you would compare border security in the face of violent militant cartels to

03:37.480 --> 03:42.160
apartheid simply because a wall is involved and that you would somehow pin that insane

03:42.200 --> 03:46.720
fantasyland justification on centrists is mind boggling to me.

03:46.720 --> 03:50.280
But it's not just Twitter nobodies that hold this view of politics.

03:50.280 --> 03:54.580
Like I said earlier, the media's radicalized itself leftward as well, and the demonization

03:54.580 --> 03:57.200
of centrists can be seen in some of the rhetoric they push.

03:57.200 --> 04:02.640
For example, in the 2016 election cycle HuffPo article, more evidence that centrist solutions

04:02.640 --> 04:03.640
can't save us.

04:03.640 --> 04:08.340
The presumed presidential nominee of the Democratic party is expected to embrace standard democratic

04:08.340 --> 04:12.140
initiatives like raising the minimum wage, investing in infrastructure, closing corporate

04:12.140 --> 04:16.580
tax loopholes and cutting taxes for the middle class, along with newer ideas like providing

04:16.580 --> 04:20.780
incentives to corporations to increase profit sharing with employees, and changing labor

04:20.780 --> 04:23.540
laws to give workers more collective bargaining power.

04:23.540 --> 04:28.680
These ideas, while worthwhile, will not reverse our multi-decade descent into equality.

04:28.680 --> 04:32.880
Nor does it seem likely that the philosophy of Hillary Clinton's advisers will resonate

04:32.880 --> 04:36.300
with the voters who have lost so much ground during this process of decline.

04:36.300 --> 04:40.300
They call it inclusive capitalism, and that's a formulation which would not have been out

04:40.300 --> 04:43.700
of place in conservative Republican platforms of recent decades.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.980
Do you see what this guy's saying?

04:45.980 --> 04:50.260
Inclusive capitalism, meaning capitalism with a safety net and a mechanism to get the poorest

04:50.260 --> 04:54.820
of the poor on the board, like a healthcare system or a student loan system, is not radical

04:54.820 --> 04:55.820
enough change.

04:55.820 --> 04:59.220
To me, that's about as far as we should be going, but that's why centrists are

04:59.220 --> 05:00.220
demonized.

05:00.220 --> 05:02.700
If it's not radicalism, it's simply a waste of time.

05:02.700 --> 05:07.940
But not only is centrism considered a counter-revolutionary force, it's also a pie-in-the-sky idea

05:07.940 --> 05:10.540
that will never actually exist, apparently.

05:10.540 --> 05:12.660
Stop whining, centrists.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.780
Bipartisanship is a myth that never existed.

05:14.780 --> 05:17.540
Everything is an eternal revolutionary struggle, comrade.

05:17.540 --> 05:19.220
All hierarchies are corrupt with power.

05:19.220 --> 05:22.660
All relations between individuals or group are always a form of combat.

05:22.660 --> 05:28.020
The difference between 2013 and 1963 is that in the earlier period, liberals and conservatives

05:28.020 --> 05:31.820
were found in both of the two parties, which still reflected the geographic realignment

05:31.820 --> 05:33.220
that had produced the Civil War.

05:33.220 --> 05:37.260
The Democrats, still based in the South, had their conservative Southern and Midwestern

05:37.260 --> 05:41.500
members, while the Republicans, still the Northern party of Lincoln, had many liberal

05:41.500 --> 05:42.500
members.

05:42.500 --> 05:46.580
So both parties had traditionally conservative and liberal wings, and likely were able to

05:46.580 --> 05:48.780
come together on multiple issues in the past?

05:48.780 --> 05:51.600
Isn't that the very nature of bipartisanship?

05:51.600 --> 05:55.480
Politics is civil war by bloodless means, ballots rather than bullets.

05:55.480 --> 05:59.700
For one side to win, the other side has to lose, and for one side to win, it needs to

05:59.700 --> 06:04.440
mobilize enough support to roll over a bitter and determined opposition if necessary.

06:04.440 --> 06:07.560
This is the analysis of somebody unwilling to compromise.

06:07.560 --> 06:11.920
If you don't give an inch, then yes, either you steamroll your opponent, or you get steamrolled

06:11.920 --> 06:12.920
yourself.

06:12.920 --> 06:16.780
But it only has to be that way if you are stupidly, suicidally stubborn.

06:16.780 --> 06:19.960
Take the current government shutdown over the funding of the wall, for example.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.520
What if the Democrats actually decided to stop being petulant children and presented

06:23.520 --> 06:24.700
Trump with a deal?

06:24.700 --> 06:28.720
Something like, say, we'll give you the wall if you give us Obamacare.

06:28.740 --> 06:33.100
That would be actual compromise, not one side simply crushing the other.

06:33.100 --> 06:36.220
Each party would walk away with something that they want, something they can show to

06:36.220 --> 06:40.180
their constituents and say, look, we can actually get work done sometimes.

06:40.180 --> 06:43.580
But if you come from the postmodernist school of thought where everything boils down to

06:43.580 --> 06:47.880
a simple power struggle, it's no surprise that you think centrists and their silly ideas

06:47.880 --> 06:50.280
like compromises are unrealistic.

06:50.280 --> 06:54.780
Another core tenet of centrism, horseshoe theory, that the radical left and the radical

06:54.780 --> 06:58.420
right have more in common with each other than they do with the center left and center

06:58.420 --> 07:02.340
right, is also, predictably, something that the media has in its sights.

07:02.340 --> 07:05.640
And just as predictably, they describe it as the tool of fascists.

07:05.640 --> 07:08.600
Let's put an end to horseshoe theory once and for all.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.200
Accusing the left of fascism only helps the real fascists.

07:11.200 --> 07:14.400
Well, no, I wouldn't accuse the radical left of being fascists.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.580
I'd accuse them of being tyrants.

07:16.580 --> 07:19.480
Fascism is a form of tyranny unique to the right, but that doesn't mean that the left

07:19.480 --> 07:20.960
can't also be tyrannical.

07:20.960 --> 07:25.720
For centrists and for right-wingers, horseshoe theory is a convenient chunk of heavy iron

07:25.720 --> 07:29.620
to toss in the faces of left-wing opponents, but its very convenience should be treated

07:29.620 --> 07:30.620
with suspicion.

07:30.620 --> 07:34.300
Everyone loves to hate the left, but hating the left isn't a good way to fight right-wing

07:34.300 --> 07:35.300
extremism.

07:35.300 --> 07:39.580
On the contrary, the conflation of alt-right Nazis with a supposed alt-left gives people

07:39.580 --> 07:44.020
like President Donald Trump and former Breitbart chairman Steve Bannon rhetorical cover to

07:44.020 --> 07:46.580
slime their critics as the real fascists.

07:46.580 --> 07:50.340
Perhaps even worse, claiming that the left is especially prone to fascist tendencies

07:50.340 --> 07:54.420
allows folks on other parts of the political spectrum to ignore their own complicity when

07:54.420 --> 07:56.600
actual fascism crawls out of the mud.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.480
And here is the core problem.

07:58.480 --> 08:02.320
Actual fascism has not yet crawled out of the mud, and your hyperbole does not make

08:02.320 --> 08:03.320
it so.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.880
Trump, for all of his faults, is not a fascist.

08:05.880 --> 08:09.600
Bolsonaro, for everything he's done since taking office, and we will talk about that

08:09.600 --> 08:12.800
on the channel soon too, is still not a fascist.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.320
Steve Bannon is not a fascist.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.560
Politicians that you disagree with are not simply fascists.

08:18.560 --> 08:22.480
For example, people called Brett Kavanaugh a fascist back during the nomination.

08:22.480 --> 08:25.620
Nobody on the left cared that it was a grossly inaccurate statement.

08:25.620 --> 08:30.780
Nobody cared that Kavanaugh considered, for example, Roe vs Wade to be a settled matter.

08:30.780 --> 08:34.780
He was just a fascist, because all people that aren't radical lefties are fascists.

08:34.780 --> 08:35.780
And that was that.

08:35.780 --> 08:40.000
As anybody with a brain could have predicted, Kavanaugh's actions since the confirmation

08:40.000 --> 08:43.160
have been characteristic of your average center-right conservative.

08:43.160 --> 08:46.860
But should you bring his name up to an SJW, they'd act like he's been personally leading

08:46.860 --> 08:50.200
right-wing death squads every day since he took his seat on the court.

08:50.200 --> 08:54.660
The real reason the radical left demonizes centrists as being part of the radical right,

08:54.660 --> 08:59.180
and vice versa, I might add, is because when viewing reasonable centrist positions through

08:59.180 --> 09:03.360
their ideological lens, they see opposing stripes of radicalism.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.740
Here's one final example.

09:04.740 --> 09:08.900
It's good that Dan Hodges is a centrist and would never push a far-right agenda.

09:08.900 --> 09:14.600
The poster is being sarcastic, and he includes three Dan Hodges quotes that he sees as far-right

09:14.600 --> 09:16.820
as a way to discredit the idea of centrism.

09:16.820 --> 09:17.820
The quotes read,

09:46.820 --> 09:50.320
There's not too much that's factually wrong with these statements.

09:50.320 --> 09:54.080
Maybe the first one is a stretch, equating ISIS with all Muslims, but the other two are

09:54.080 --> 09:56.480
spot on, 100% accurate.

09:56.480 --> 10:00.740
However, one of the radical left's core tenants right now is Islamic apologia.

10:00.740 --> 10:05.740
When somebody, anybody, is not willing to be an Islamic apologist, if instead they recognize

10:05.740 --> 10:10.500
the danger that Islam poses to the kafir, the non-believer, if instead they want individual

10:10.500 --> 10:14.720
Muslims held accountable for their repulsive actions, even if those actions are permitted

10:14.720 --> 10:19.820
under Sharia law, the radical left sees them not as a rational centrist, but as a fascist,

10:19.820 --> 10:22.460
a Nazi, a member of the dreaded alt-right.

10:22.460 --> 10:24.200
But that's not how the world works.

10:24.200 --> 10:28.540
The core ideology of the left has shifted so far into the territory of radicalism that

10:28.540 --> 10:31.420
to them, all centrists look like the far-right.

10:31.420 --> 10:35.280
And so the very concept of centrism itself becomes a joke in their eyes.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.500
They see no centrists, only Nazis.

10:37.500 --> 10:40.800
And when somebody proclaims themselves to be a centrist in their own defense, they simply

10:40.800 --> 10:42.980
view the word as a synonym for Nazi.

10:42.980 --> 10:46.180
There can be no compromise with these Nazis in centrist clothing.

10:46.180 --> 10:48.760
The only option left on the table is war.

10:48.760 --> 10:52.820
And while it's a war that the radical left will never win as they continue to radicalize

10:52.820 --> 10:57.700
even further and leave large swaths of the voting populace behind in their wake, it's

10:57.700 --> 11:00.060
also a war that none of us will ever win.

11:00.060 --> 11:04.020
What we all understand to be compromised in order to find the best possible solution,

11:04.020 --> 11:07.100
they view as an immoral collaboration with a hated enemy.

11:07.100 --> 11:11.420
The increasing demonization of the centrist is just a symptom of the radical left's, and

11:11.420 --> 11:16.020
the religious rights before it, unwillingness to compromise with those they see as tainted,

11:16.020 --> 11:20.580
impure, unclean, and unfortunately for society, that's almost everybody.

11:20.580 --> 11:24.740
As long as the left is unwilling to put aside its unending brinkmanship, come to the table

11:24.740 --> 11:29.420
and hammer out an agreement that nobody likes, everybody can live with, and allows the government

11:29.420 --> 11:32.020
to get some real work done, we are all going to suffer.
