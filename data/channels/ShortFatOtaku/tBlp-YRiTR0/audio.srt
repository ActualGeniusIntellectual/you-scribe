1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
So I've been working on a long-form Bolsonaro video, and in gathering up various sources

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,780
and articles and tweets, I've noticed a trend developing among both the radical left

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,200
and the alt-right, though the radical left seems to be currently the larger culprit.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,460
Why is there so much hatred towards people who consider themselves centrists or classical

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,460
liberals?

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,540
Here's Margo Pez, the founder of Esther, a Patreon alternative that sees Patreon somehow

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,380
as far-right, and bills themselves as a progressive, lefty alternative.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,740
Wondering what happened to SubscribeStar, I hope nobody with the wrong opinions signs

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,740
up to your service.

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,740
I'm not a fan of the centrist fanbase Beto has, but I support his call for an end to

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,860
this unjust system.

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,500
She's talking about Beto O'Rourke, the center-left option currently filling the Democratic

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,820
Party's power vacuum after the collapse of the Clinton machine.

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,280
The fact that he's explicitly not a radical seems to be what Margo's complaining about.

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,420
And what about Kyle Kalinske on the same topic?

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,420
Beto apologized to Ted Cruz for saying that Lion Ted was an accurate nickname, and he

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,460
livestreamed himself at the dentist.

18
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,860
Even putting his super-centrist voting record aside, I don't think he'll be the Democratic

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,860
nominee.

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,540
Why is his centrist voting record a problem?

21
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,020
Surely that would mean he has an ability to meet his opponents in the middle and compromise

22
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,860
in order to get real work done, right?

23
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,140
Here's a tweet from Anarkofak, a disabled trans woman libertarian socialist YouTuber

24
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,340
who's trying to spread radical theory.

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,860
I'm surprised there's no pronouns in that bio.

26
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,740
Universities are not full of radical leftists.

27
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,620
They're overwhelmingly full of liberal centrists.

28
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,840
People on the right are just so reactionary that they mistake the mild progressivism of

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,500
liberal centrists, such as supporting LGBTQ rights, as radical leftism.

30
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,820
I think by your own self-identification, you are not an accurate judge of what is and isn't

31
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,180
a radical leftist.

32
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,420
And at the expense of exposing myself, and by extension you, as an old person, simply

33
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,980
supporting LGBTQ rights is what your average university student did 15 years ago, back

34
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,420
when I was at university for the first time.

35
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,060
And there were a small minority of religious conservatives, ever shrinking, ever outraged

36
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,500
at the on-campus support for the gays.

37
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,100
But as I said, that was 15 years back.

38
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,240
Canada and the US have since legalized gay marriage.

39
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,040
Legal roadblocks for LGBTQ people are either gone or in the process of disappearing.

40
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,680
We supported those rights back then because there was a need for legislative change.

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,680
But now?

42
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,920
The activist class was faced with a choice.

43
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,800
Either shut down and disperse, or lurch ever more radically to the left in order to invent

44
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,680
new causes to continually justify their existence.

45
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,920
And whenever you lurch more left, centrists start to look an awful lot like the far right

46
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
that you hate.

47
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,880
I've had those three tweets linked to me by viewers of the channel, but just for fun's

48
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,420
sake, let's do a quick scroll through the use of the word centrist on Twitter right

49
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,100
now and see what we can find.

50
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,500
Pretty cool how the only way this shutdown doesn't end with the complete political

51
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,500
annihilation of Trump and the Republican party is if a lazy corporate centrist media skews

52
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,160
the narrative into somehow being the Democrats' fault for not compromising and that's exactly

53
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,160
what we're seeing.

54
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,780
The media's been lurching left along with the SJWs, but I guess since they're not

55
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,500
keeping pace, they're centrists now, eh?

56
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,340
I only take criticism from Marxist feminists.

57
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,340
I truly don't give a fuck about some centrist liberal's opinion, especially not through

58
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,520
CC.

59
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,520
After all, liberals get the bullet too.

60
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,960
This isn't fact checking, it's a weird centrist mind exercise.

61
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,240
This is in response to a fact check of a recent Donald Trump speech.

62
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,920
It wasn't all good for Trump, but it was worse for the Dems.

63
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,240
As it turns out, pesky things like truth and facts qualify as a weird centrist mind exercise.

64
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,440
Responsible centrist.

65
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,600
What about apartheid?

66
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,480
The fact that you would compare border security in the face of violent militant cartels to

67
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,160
apartheid simply because a wall is involved and that you would somehow pin that insane

68
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,720
fantasyland justification on centrists is mind boggling to me.

69
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,280
But it's not just Twitter nobodies that hold this view of politics.

70
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,580
Like I said earlier, the media's radicalized itself leftward as well, and the demonization

71
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,200
of centrists can be seen in some of the rhetoric they push.

72
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,640
For example, in the 2016 election cycle HuffPo article, more evidence that centrist solutions

73
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
can't save us.

74
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,340
The presumed presidential nominee of the Democratic party is expected to embrace standard democratic

75
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,140
initiatives like raising the minimum wage, investing in infrastructure, closing corporate

76
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,580
tax loopholes and cutting taxes for the middle class, along with newer ideas like providing

77
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,780
incentives to corporations to increase profit sharing with employees, and changing labor

78
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,540
laws to give workers more collective bargaining power.

79
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,680
These ideas, while worthwhile, will not reverse our multi-decade descent into equality.

80
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,880
Nor does it seem likely that the philosophy of Hillary Clinton's advisers will resonate

81
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,300
with the voters who have lost so much ground during this process of decline.

82
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,300
They call it inclusive capitalism, and that's a formulation which would not have been out

83
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,700
of place in conservative Republican platforms of recent decades.

84
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,980
Do you see what this guy's saying?

85
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:50,260
Inclusive capitalism, meaning capitalism with a safety net and a mechanism to get the poorest

86
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,820
of the poor on the board, like a healthcare system or a student loan system, is not radical

87
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,820
enough change.

88
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,220
To me, that's about as far as we should be going, but that's why centrists are

89
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,220
demonized.

90
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,700
If it's not radicalism, it's simply a waste of time.

91
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,940
But not only is centrism considered a counter-revolutionary force, it's also a pie-in-the-sky idea

92
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,540
that will never actually exist, apparently.

93
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,660
Stop whining, centrists.

94
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,780
Bipartisanship is a myth that never existed.

95
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,540
Everything is an eternal revolutionary struggle, comrade.

96
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,220
All hierarchies are corrupt with power.

97
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,660
All relations between individuals or group are always a form of combat.

98
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:28,020
The difference between 2013 and 1963 is that in the earlier period, liberals and conservatives

99
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,820
were found in both of the two parties, which still reflected the geographic realignment

100
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,220
that had produced the Civil War.

101
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,260
The Democrats, still based in the South, had their conservative Southern and Midwestern

102
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,500
members, while the Republicans, still the Northern party of Lincoln, had many liberal

103
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
members.

104
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,580
So both parties had traditionally conservative and liberal wings, and likely were able to

105
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,780
come together on multiple issues in the past?

106
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,600
Isn't that the very nature of bipartisanship?

107
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,480
Politics is civil war by bloodless means, ballots rather than bullets.

108
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,700
For one side to win, the other side has to lose, and for one side to win, it needs to

109
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,440
mobilize enough support to roll over a bitter and determined opposition if necessary.

110
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,560
This is the analysis of somebody unwilling to compromise.

111
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,920
If you don't give an inch, then yes, either you steamroll your opponent, or you get steamrolled

112
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
yourself.

113
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,780
But it only has to be that way if you are stupidly, suicidally stubborn.

114
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,960
Take the current government shutdown over the funding of the wall, for example.

115
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,520
What if the Democrats actually decided to stop being petulant children and presented

116
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,700
Trump with a deal?

117
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,720
Something like, say, we'll give you the wall if you give us Obamacare.

118
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,100
That would be actual compromise, not one side simply crushing the other.

119
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,220
Each party would walk away with something that they want, something they can show to

120
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,180
their constituents and say, look, we can actually get work done sometimes.

121
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,580
But if you come from the postmodernist school of thought where everything boils down to

122
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,880
a simple power struggle, it's no surprise that you think centrists and their silly ideas

123
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,280
like compromises are unrealistic.

124
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,780
Another core tenet of centrism, horseshoe theory, that the radical left and the radical

125
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,420
right have more in common with each other than they do with the center left and center

126
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,340
right, is also, predictably, something that the media has in its sights.

127
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,640
And just as predictably, they describe it as the tool of fascists.

128
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,600
Let's put an end to horseshoe theory once and for all.

129
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,200
Accusing the left of fascism only helps the real fascists.

130
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,400
Well, no, I wouldn't accuse the radical left of being fascists.

131
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,580
I'd accuse them of being tyrants.

132
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,480
Fascism is a form of tyranny unique to the right, but that doesn't mean that the left

133
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,960
can't also be tyrannical.

134
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,720
For centrists and for right-wingers, horseshoe theory is a convenient chunk of heavy iron

135
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,620
to toss in the faces of left-wing opponents, but its very convenience should be treated

136
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,620
with suspicion.

137
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,300
Everyone loves to hate the left, but hating the left isn't a good way to fight right-wing

138
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,300
extremism.

139
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,580
On the contrary, the conflation of alt-right Nazis with a supposed alt-left gives people

140
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,020
like President Donald Trump and former Breitbart chairman Steve Bannon rhetorical cover to

141
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,580
slime their critics as the real fascists.

142
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,340
Perhaps even worse, claiming that the left is especially prone to fascist tendencies

143
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,420
allows folks on other parts of the political spectrum to ignore their own complicity when

144
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,600
actual fascism crawls out of the mud.

145
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,480
And here is the core problem.

146
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,320
Actual fascism has not yet crawled out of the mud, and your hyperbole does not make

147
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
it so.

148
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,880
Trump, for all of his faults, is not a fascist.

149
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,600
Bolsonaro, for everything he's done since taking office, and we will talk about that

150
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,800
on the channel soon too, is still not a fascist.

151
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,320
Steve Bannon is not a fascist.

152
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,560
Politicians that you disagree with are not simply fascists.

153
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,480
For example, people called Brett Kavanaugh a fascist back during the nomination.

154
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,620
Nobody on the left cared that it was a grossly inaccurate statement.

155
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,780
Nobody cared that Kavanaugh considered, for example, Roe vs Wade to be a settled matter.

156
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,780
He was just a fascist, because all people that aren't radical lefties are fascists.

157
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,780
And that was that.

158
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,000
As anybody with a brain could have predicted, Kavanaugh's actions since the confirmation

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,160
have been characteristic of your average center-right conservative.

160
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,860
But should you bring his name up to an SJW, they'd act like he's been personally leading

161
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,200
right-wing death squads every day since he took his seat on the court.

162
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,660
The real reason the radical left demonizes centrists as being part of the radical right,

163
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,180
and vice versa, I might add, is because when viewing reasonable centrist positions through

164
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,360
their ideological lens, they see opposing stripes of radicalism.

165
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,740
Here's one final example.

166
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,900
It's good that Dan Hodges is a centrist and would never push a far-right agenda.

167
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:14,600
The poster is being sarcastic, and he includes three Dan Hodges quotes that he sees as far-right

168
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,820
as a way to discredit the idea of centrism.

169
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,820
The quotes read,

170
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,320
There's not too much that's factually wrong with these statements.

171
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,080
Maybe the first one is a stretch, equating ISIS with all Muslims, but the other two are

172
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,480
spot on, 100% accurate.

173
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,740
However, one of the radical left's core tenants right now is Islamic apologia.

174
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,740
When somebody, anybody, is not willing to be an Islamic apologist, if instead they recognize

175
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,500
the danger that Islam poses to the kafir, the non-believer, if instead they want individual

176
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,720
Muslims held accountable for their repulsive actions, even if those actions are permitted

177
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,820
under Sharia law, the radical left sees them not as a rational centrist, but as a fascist,

178
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,460
a Nazi, a member of the dreaded alt-right.

179
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,200
But that's not how the world works.

180
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,540
The core ideology of the left has shifted so far into the territory of radicalism that

181
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,420
to them, all centrists look like the far-right.

182
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,280
And so the very concept of centrism itself becomes a joke in their eyes.

183
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,500
They see no centrists, only Nazis.

184
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,800
And when somebody proclaims themselves to be a centrist in their own defense, they simply

185
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,980
view the word as a synonym for Nazi.

186
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,180
There can be no compromise with these Nazis in centrist clothing.

187
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,760
The only option left on the table is war.

188
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,820
And while it's a war that the radical left will never win as they continue to radicalize

189
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,700
even further and leave large swaths of the voting populace behind in their wake, it's

190
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,060
also a war that none of us will ever win.

191
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,020
What we all understand to be compromised in order to find the best possible solution,

192
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,100
they view as an immoral collaboration with a hated enemy.

193
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,420
The increasing demonization of the centrist is just a symptom of the radical left's, and

194
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:16,020
the religious rights before it, unwillingness to compromise with those they see as tainted,

195
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,580
impure, unclean, and unfortunately for society, that's almost everybody.

196
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,740
As long as the left is unwilling to put aside its unending brinkmanship, come to the table

197
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,420
and hammer out an agreement that nobody likes, everybody can live with, and allows the government

198
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,020
to get some real work done, we are all going to suffer.
