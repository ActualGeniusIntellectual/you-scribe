0	4380	So I've been working on a long-form Bolsonaro video, and in gathering up various sources
4380	8780	and articles and tweets, I've noticed a trend developing among both the radical left
8780	13200	and the alt-right, though the radical left seems to be currently the larger culprit.
13200	17460	Why is there so much hatred towards people who consider themselves centrists or classical
17460	18460	liberals?
18460	23540	Here's Margo Pez, the founder of Esther, a Patreon alternative that sees Patreon somehow
23540	28380	as far-right, and bills themselves as a progressive, lefty alternative.
28380	32740	Wondering what happened to SubscribeStar, I hope nobody with the wrong opinions signs
32740	33740	up to your service.
33740	38740	I'm not a fan of the centrist fanbase Beto has, but I support his call for an end to
38740	39860	this unjust system.
39860	44500	She's talking about Beto O'Rourke, the center-left option currently filling the Democratic
44500	47820	Party's power vacuum after the collapse of the Clinton machine.
47820	52280	The fact that he's explicitly not a radical seems to be what Margo's complaining about.
52280	54420	And what about Kyle Kalinske on the same topic?
54420	58420	Beto apologized to Ted Cruz for saying that Lion Ted was an accurate nickname, and he
58420	60460	livestreamed himself at the dentist.
60460	64860	Even putting his super-centrist voting record aside, I don't think he'll be the Democratic
64860	65860	nominee.
65860	67540	Why is his centrist voting record a problem?
67540	71020	Surely that would mean he has an ability to meet his opponents in the middle and compromise
71020	72860	in order to get real work done, right?
72860	78140	Here's a tweet from Anarkofak, a disabled trans woman libertarian socialist YouTuber
78140	80340	who's trying to spread radical theory.
80340	82860	I'm surprised there's no pronouns in that bio.
82860	85740	Universities are not full of radical leftists.
85740	88620	They're overwhelmingly full of liberal centrists.
88620	92840	People on the right are just so reactionary that they mistake the mild progressivism of
92840	97500	liberal centrists, such as supporting LGBTQ rights, as radical leftism.
97500	102820	I think by your own self-identification, you are not an accurate judge of what is and isn't
102820	104180	a radical leftist.
104180	109420	And at the expense of exposing myself, and by extension you, as an old person, simply
109420	114980	supporting LGBTQ rights is what your average university student did 15 years ago, back
114980	117420	when I was at university for the first time.
117420	122060	And there were a small minority of religious conservatives, ever shrinking, ever outraged
122060	124500	at the on-campus support for the gays.
124500	127100	But as I said, that was 15 years back.
127100	130240	Canada and the US have since legalized gay marriage.
130240	135040	Legal roadblocks for LGBTQ people are either gone or in the process of disappearing.
135040	139680	We supported those rights back then because there was a need for legislative change.
139680	140680	But now?
140680	142920	The activist class was faced with a choice.
142920	147800	Either shut down and disperse, or lurch ever more radically to the left in order to invent
147800	150680	new causes to continually justify their existence.
150680	154920	And whenever you lurch more left, centrists start to look an awful lot like the far right
154920	155920	that you hate.
155920	159880	I've had those three tweets linked to me by viewers of the channel, but just for fun's
159880	163420	sake, let's do a quick scroll through the use of the word centrist on Twitter right
163420	165100	now and see what we can find.
165100	168500	Pretty cool how the only way this shutdown doesn't end with the complete political
168500	173500	annihilation of Trump and the Republican party is if a lazy corporate centrist media skews
173500	177160	the narrative into somehow being the Democrats' fault for not compromising and that's exactly
177160	178160	what we're seeing.
178160	181780	The media's been lurching left along with the SJWs, but I guess since they're not
181780	184500	keeping pace, they're centrists now, eh?
184500	187340	I only take criticism from Marxist feminists.
187340	191340	I truly don't give a fuck about some centrist liberal's opinion, especially not through
191340	192520	CC.
192520	194520	After all, liberals get the bullet too.
194520	197960	This isn't fact checking, it's a weird centrist mind exercise.
197960	201240	This is in response to a fact check of a recent Donald Trump speech.
201240	203920	It wasn't all good for Trump, but it was worse for the Dems.
203920	210240	As it turns out, pesky things like truth and facts qualify as a weird centrist mind exercise.
210240	211440	Responsible centrist.
211440	212600	What about apartheid?
212600	217480	The fact that you would compare border security in the face of violent militant cartels to
217480	222160	apartheid simply because a wall is involved and that you would somehow pin that insane
222200	226720	fantasyland justification on centrists is mind boggling to me.
226720	230280	But it's not just Twitter nobodies that hold this view of politics.
230280	234580	Like I said earlier, the media's radicalized itself leftward as well, and the demonization
234580	237200	of centrists can be seen in some of the rhetoric they push.
237200	242640	For example, in the 2016 election cycle HuffPo article, more evidence that centrist solutions
242640	243640	can't save us.
243640	248340	The presumed presidential nominee of the Democratic party is expected to embrace standard democratic
248340	252140	initiatives like raising the minimum wage, investing in infrastructure, closing corporate
252140	256580	tax loopholes and cutting taxes for the middle class, along with newer ideas like providing
256580	260780	incentives to corporations to increase profit sharing with employees, and changing labor
260780	263540	laws to give workers more collective bargaining power.
263540	268680	These ideas, while worthwhile, will not reverse our multi-decade descent into equality.
268680	272880	Nor does it seem likely that the philosophy of Hillary Clinton's advisers will resonate
272880	276300	with the voters who have lost so much ground during this process of decline.
276300	280300	They call it inclusive capitalism, and that's a formulation which would not have been out
280300	283700	of place in conservative Republican platforms of recent decades.
283700	285980	Do you see what this guy's saying?
285980	290260	Inclusive capitalism, meaning capitalism with a safety net and a mechanism to get the poorest
290260	294820	of the poor on the board, like a healthcare system or a student loan system, is not radical
294820	295820	enough change.
295820	299220	To me, that's about as far as we should be going, but that's why centrists are
299220	300220	demonized.
300220	302700	If it's not radicalism, it's simply a waste of time.
302700	307940	But not only is centrism considered a counter-revolutionary force, it's also a pie-in-the-sky idea
307940	310540	that will never actually exist, apparently.
310540	312660	Stop whining, centrists.
312660	314780	Bipartisanship is a myth that never existed.
314780	317540	Everything is an eternal revolutionary struggle, comrade.
317540	319220	All hierarchies are corrupt with power.
319220	322660	All relations between individuals or group are always a form of combat.
322660	328020	The difference between 2013 and 1963 is that in the earlier period, liberals and conservatives
328020	331820	were found in both of the two parties, which still reflected the geographic realignment
331820	333220	that had produced the Civil War.
333220	337260	The Democrats, still based in the South, had their conservative Southern and Midwestern
337260	341500	members, while the Republicans, still the Northern party of Lincoln, had many liberal
341500	342500	members.
342500	346580	So both parties had traditionally conservative and liberal wings, and likely were able to
346580	348780	come together on multiple issues in the past?
348780	351600	Isn't that the very nature of bipartisanship?
351600	355480	Politics is civil war by bloodless means, ballots rather than bullets.
355480	359700	For one side to win, the other side has to lose, and for one side to win, it needs to
359700	364440	mobilize enough support to roll over a bitter and determined opposition if necessary.
364440	367560	This is the analysis of somebody unwilling to compromise.
367560	371920	If you don't give an inch, then yes, either you steamroll your opponent, or you get steamrolled
371920	372920	yourself.
372920	376780	But it only has to be that way if you are stupidly, suicidally stubborn.
376780	379960	Take the current government shutdown over the funding of the wall, for example.
379960	383520	What if the Democrats actually decided to stop being petulant children and presented
383520	384700	Trump with a deal?
384700	388720	Something like, say, we'll give you the wall if you give us Obamacare.
388740	393100	That would be actual compromise, not one side simply crushing the other.
393100	396220	Each party would walk away with something that they want, something they can show to
396220	400180	their constituents and say, look, we can actually get work done sometimes.
400180	403580	But if you come from the postmodernist school of thought where everything boils down to
403580	407880	a simple power struggle, it's no surprise that you think centrists and their silly ideas
407880	410280	like compromises are unrealistic.
410280	414780	Another core tenet of centrism, horseshoe theory, that the radical left and the radical
414780	418420	right have more in common with each other than they do with the center left and center
418420	422340	right, is also, predictably, something that the media has in its sights.
422340	425640	And just as predictably, they describe it as the tool of fascists.
425640	428600	Let's put an end to horseshoe theory once and for all.
428600	431200	Accusing the left of fascism only helps the real fascists.
431200	434400	Well, no, I wouldn't accuse the radical left of being fascists.
434400	436580	I'd accuse them of being tyrants.
436580	439480	Fascism is a form of tyranny unique to the right, but that doesn't mean that the left
439480	440960	can't also be tyrannical.
440960	445720	For centrists and for right-wingers, horseshoe theory is a convenient chunk of heavy iron
445720	449620	to toss in the faces of left-wing opponents, but its very convenience should be treated
449620	450620	with suspicion.
450620	454300	Everyone loves to hate the left, but hating the left isn't a good way to fight right-wing
454300	455300	extremism.
455300	459580	On the contrary, the conflation of alt-right Nazis with a supposed alt-left gives people
459580	464020	like President Donald Trump and former Breitbart chairman Steve Bannon rhetorical cover to
464020	466580	slime their critics as the real fascists.
466580	470340	Perhaps even worse, claiming that the left is especially prone to fascist tendencies
470340	474420	allows folks on other parts of the political spectrum to ignore their own complicity when
474420	476600	actual fascism crawls out of the mud.
476600	478480	And here is the core problem.
478480	482320	Actual fascism has not yet crawled out of the mud, and your hyperbole does not make
482320	483320	it so.
483320	485880	Trump, for all of his faults, is not a fascist.
485880	489600	Bolsonaro, for everything he's done since taking office, and we will talk about that
489600	492800	on the channel soon too, is still not a fascist.
492800	495320	Steve Bannon is not a fascist.
495320	498560	Politicians that you disagree with are not simply fascists.
498560	502480	For example, people called Brett Kavanaugh a fascist back during the nomination.
502480	505620	Nobody on the left cared that it was a grossly inaccurate statement.
505620	510780	Nobody cared that Kavanaugh considered, for example, Roe vs Wade to be a settled matter.
510780	514780	He was just a fascist, because all people that aren't radical lefties are fascists.
514780	515780	And that was that.
515780	520000	As anybody with a brain could have predicted, Kavanaugh's actions since the confirmation
520000	523160	have been characteristic of your average center-right conservative.
523160	526860	But should you bring his name up to an SJW, they'd act like he's been personally leading
526860	530200	right-wing death squads every day since he took his seat on the court.
530200	534660	The real reason the radical left demonizes centrists as being part of the radical right,
534660	539180	and vice versa, I might add, is because when viewing reasonable centrist positions through
539180	543360	their ideological lens, they see opposing stripes of radicalism.
543360	544740	Here's one final example.
544740	548900	It's good that Dan Hodges is a centrist and would never push a far-right agenda.
548900	554600	The poster is being sarcastic, and he includes three Dan Hodges quotes that he sees as far-right
554600	556820	as a way to discredit the idea of centrism.
556820	557820	The quotes read,
586820	590320	There's not too much that's factually wrong with these statements.
590320	594080	Maybe the first one is a stretch, equating ISIS with all Muslims, but the other two are
594080	596480	spot on, 100% accurate.
596480	600740	However, one of the radical left's core tenants right now is Islamic apologia.
600740	605740	When somebody, anybody, is not willing to be an Islamic apologist, if instead they recognize
605740	610500	the danger that Islam poses to the kafir, the non-believer, if instead they want individual
610500	614720	Muslims held accountable for their repulsive actions, even if those actions are permitted
614720	619820	under Sharia law, the radical left sees them not as a rational centrist, but as a fascist,
619820	622460	a Nazi, a member of the dreaded alt-right.
622460	624200	But that's not how the world works.
624200	628540	The core ideology of the left has shifted so far into the territory of radicalism that
628540	631420	to them, all centrists look like the far-right.
631420	635280	And so the very concept of centrism itself becomes a joke in their eyes.
635280	637500	They see no centrists, only Nazis.
637500	640800	And when somebody proclaims themselves to be a centrist in their own defense, they simply
640800	642980	view the word as a synonym for Nazi.
642980	646180	There can be no compromise with these Nazis in centrist clothing.
646180	648760	The only option left on the table is war.
648760	652820	And while it's a war that the radical left will never win as they continue to radicalize
652820	657700	even further and leave large swaths of the voting populace behind in their wake, it's
657700	660060	also a war that none of us will ever win.
660060	664020	What we all understand to be compromised in order to find the best possible solution,
664020	667100	they view as an immoral collaboration with a hated enemy.
667100	671420	The increasing demonization of the centrist is just a symptom of the radical left's, and
671420	676020	the religious rights before it, unwillingness to compromise with those they see as tainted,
676020	680580	impure, unclean, and unfortunately for society, that's almost everybody.
680580	684740	As long as the left is unwilling to put aside its unending brinkmanship, come to the table
684740	689420	and hammer out an agreement that nobody likes, everybody can live with, and allows the government
689420	692020	to get some real work done, we are all going to suffer.
