00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Trans Women Are Women

00:05.680 --> 00:10.980
In this year's Christmas video, Merry Turfmas, I put forward the opinion that the trans activist

00:10.980 --> 00:15.960
position of either you believe trans women are women or you're transphobic is a ridiculous

00:15.960 --> 00:16.960
one.

00:16.960 --> 00:20.120
The reason it's ridiculous is that it goes beyond asking for tolerance for that liberal

00:20.120 --> 00:24.380
live-and-let-live ideal and instead aims for ideological colonization.

00:24.380 --> 00:28.200
If I believed that trans women were men, then the liberal prescription would be something

00:28.200 --> 00:32.560
like, okay, I can hold that opinion, I can express it, I can institute rules of conduct

00:32.560 --> 00:36.760
for my private spaces, but I can't barge into a trans woman's private space and call

00:36.760 --> 00:41.560
her a man there, that's her house, not mine, and I can't try to enforce my views on others

00:41.560 --> 00:44.880
in the neutral public space through violence or coercion.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.560
Trans activists generally don't agree with that liberal compromise.

00:48.560 --> 00:52.640
They want everyone to believe, deep down in their heart of hearts, that trans women are

00:52.640 --> 00:53.640
women.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.360
That's why they consider not holding to their belief to be bigotry.

00:56.360 --> 00:59.760
And what logically follows from that position is that treating a trans woman differently

00:59.760 --> 01:02.960
than cis women in any way also has to be bigotry.

01:02.960 --> 01:04.840
Because if you're not a bigot, they're the same thing.

01:04.840 --> 01:08.180
There's no reason to treat them differently, even though that belief causes a lot of problems

01:08.180 --> 01:09.320
in the real world.

01:09.320 --> 01:14.440
My explanation as to why this is an unreasonable position is that having a belief doesn't mean

01:14.440 --> 01:16.920
that you hate people who don't share your belief.

01:16.920 --> 01:18.720
I use the example of religion to make the point.

01:18.720 --> 01:22.080
You can call me an Islamophobe for harassing Muslims on the street or vandalizing their

01:22.080 --> 01:26.000
mosques or their private property, but you can't call me an Islamophobe for not believing

01:26.040 --> 01:27.440
what Muslims believe.

01:27.440 --> 01:31.160
The same works with transphobia and not believing that trans women are women.

01:31.160 --> 01:34.720
Among the rightoids, going to somebody's Twitter profile, noticing that the leftoid

01:34.720 --> 01:38.280
they're arguing with online has pronouns in their bio, and then making a joke about

01:38.280 --> 01:39.840
it is a pretty common thing to do.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.160
The joke's got two pretty simple foundations.

01:42.160 --> 01:45.000
The first is that on the internet, it doesn't matter what pronouns you have.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.360
It doesn't matter what your gender or sex is, or your race or anything else.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.040
On the internet, we're all words on a screen.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.560
The internet isn't a real place.

01:51.560 --> 01:55.500
And the trend over the past couple of decades of bringing more and more of your real life

01:55.500 --> 01:59.420
into the online space makes people seem exceptionally vain.

01:59.420 --> 02:04.020
Millennial edgelords tend to make fun of Zoomer woke-schools for this very thing, not realizing

02:04.020 --> 02:06.940
that they don't actually live in their computer or on their phone.

02:06.940 --> 02:10.700
The second foundation, and this one's probably more important, is that for most people, you

02:10.700 --> 02:12.740
don't actually have to announce your pronouns.

02:12.740 --> 02:14.540
If you look at me, you can tell I'm a man.

02:14.540 --> 02:17.020
You don't need me to say that my pronouns are he-him.

02:17.020 --> 02:18.780
You pick that up just by looking at me.

02:18.780 --> 02:20.100
If you look at Naomi, same thing.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.380
She doesn't need to say that her pronouns are she-her.

02:22.380 --> 02:23.380
And you know what?

02:23.380 --> 02:25.100
This generally works for trans people too.

02:25.100 --> 02:29.140
Blaire White and Buck Angel don't need to inform you what their pronouns are.

02:29.140 --> 02:34.020
That intuitive knowing, where a well-passing, hyper-feminine or hyper-masculine trans person

02:34.020 --> 02:37.860
feels like they should be called by the set of pronouns that is the opposite set attached

02:37.860 --> 02:38.860
to their birth sex.

02:38.860 --> 02:40.220
That's a very common feeling.

02:40.220 --> 02:45.020
So common, in fact, that Ben Shapiro had to actually try to call Blaire White a he, working

02:45.020 --> 02:47.860
against his own intuition for comedic effect.

02:47.860 --> 02:50.160
Which was hilarious to the rest of us.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.440
Intuition rules the day when it comes to pronoun usage.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.220
We default to what feels right.

02:54.220 --> 02:58.120
And when somebody announces their pronouns, like in a Twitter bio, the normie reaction

02:58.120 --> 02:59.980
is to think, why are you saying this?

02:59.980 --> 03:01.600
This isn't information you need to tell me.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.940
This is information that your appearance will show me.

03:03.940 --> 03:07.140
And of course, ruder people might point out the obvious implication.

03:07.140 --> 03:11.660
That if you have to tell people your pronouns, it may be because you can't rely on their

03:11.660 --> 03:14.340
intuition to pick up the signals you've put out there.

03:14.340 --> 03:18.240
And that may be because you have not done a very good job at putting those signals out.

03:18.240 --> 03:21.820
This commonly comes up when the media is discussing trans criminals.

03:21.820 --> 03:25.460
There have been cases where a criminal claims to be trans or non-binary, and the article

03:25.460 --> 03:27.940
is stepping all over itself to use proper pronouns.

03:27.940 --> 03:32.740
Making it halfway illegible if they're respecting neo pronouns, or even sometimes just the singular

03:32.740 --> 03:33.740
they.

03:33.740 --> 03:37.100
Sometimes the media won't show a picture of the criminal in question, because the trans

03:37.100 --> 03:40.660
woman they're talking about is clearly just a guy who hasn't done any transitioning

03:40.660 --> 03:41.660
at all.

03:41.660 --> 03:45.180
Sometimes the media will reveal that the criminal in question is clearly faking their identity

03:45.180 --> 03:48.920
because it's become potentially useful in court to do so in the modern era.

03:48.920 --> 03:52.720
And even then, it's a 50-50 shot on what pronouns the article will choose to use.

03:52.720 --> 03:55.560
However, in the world of normies, most people just don't care.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.400
They still default to what their eyes see.

03:57.400 --> 04:00.720
Blair White's a she and this guy isn't, even if they both claim to be.

04:00.720 --> 04:04.360
None of this pronoun conversation is an issue for them, and every once in a while you'll

04:04.360 --> 04:07.760
see the wokeoids complaining about how much of a not-issue it is.

04:07.760 --> 04:11.440
How transphobic is it that cis people don't put their pronouns in their bio in an effort

04:11.440 --> 04:12.700
to be more inclusive?

04:12.700 --> 04:16.600
How we're heading towards a misgendering crisis simply because your average joe doesn't

04:16.600 --> 04:18.880
talk about any of this shit and just gets on with their day?

04:18.880 --> 04:22.720
How most people don't sign their corporate emails with pronouns, along with their name,

04:22.720 --> 04:24.280
titles, and contact info?

04:24.280 --> 04:27.760
In fact, signing emails with pronouns is a whole other rabbit hole that's come about

04:27.760 --> 04:29.120
in the past five years too.

04:29.120 --> 04:32.120
On the one hand, some people say you should absolutely do it, and it should be pushed

04:32.120 --> 04:36.400
forward positively in the workplace as a component of professional business behavior in the modern

04:36.400 --> 04:37.400
era.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.680
On the other hand, some people say it's simply performative.

04:39.680 --> 04:44.400
It's straight cis people demanding that gay trans people perform their queerness online,

04:44.400 --> 04:47.920
and that demanding it may inadvertently drag people out of the closet.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.920
But again, most normies don't care.

04:49.920 --> 04:54.360
The push to socially normalize this stuff has largely been received as cringey, especially

04:54.360 --> 04:55.360
when politicians do it.

04:55.360 --> 05:00.480
I am Kamala Harris, my pronouns are she and her, I am a woman sitting at the table wearing

05:00.480 --> 05:02.240
a blue suit.

05:02.240 --> 05:06.120
Most of the time, a pronouns workshop or seminar, where people go through these rounds of social

05:06.120 --> 05:09.000
normalization, will look and sound something like this.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.760
Hi, my name is Johnny and I use he-him pronouns.

05:11.760 --> 05:14.760
Hi, and I am Conchi and I use she-her pronouns.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.400
And we're here to talk about pronouns.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.400
What is a pronoun?

05:18.400 --> 05:22.640
A pronoun is how we identify ourselves apart from our name.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.440
And it's also how people refer to us in conversations.

05:25.440 --> 05:29.120
If you work a regular nine to five nowadays, you will likely have to at some point sit

05:29.120 --> 05:34.280
through some god awful sensitivity training where some gormless low IQ diversity hire

05:34.280 --> 05:36.320
will mumble the correct politics at you.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.920
I'm so glad I don't have to do this shit anymore, dude.

05:38.920 --> 05:43.120
Using the right pronouns is a really simple way to affirm someone's identity.

05:43.120 --> 05:46.400
It is a signal of acceptance and respect.

05:46.400 --> 05:51.040
If it's a signal of acceptance and respect, how do we go about creating a safe space for

05:51.040 --> 05:52.680
everybody?

05:52.680 --> 05:53.680
That's a good question.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.800
A really good way to do that is to use inclusive language.

05:56.800 --> 06:02.800
Instead of saying something like, hey, guys, you can say, hey, everyone or hey, team.

06:02.800 --> 06:03.800
Yeah.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.360
And now that you say that, another way that we could show that we're allies and that we

06:07.360 --> 06:13.800
accept everybody is to maybe include our pronouns in our emails or like we just did, introduce

06:13.800 --> 06:15.760
ourselves using our pronouns.

06:15.760 --> 06:20.640
But what would I do if I misgender someone?

06:20.640 --> 06:24.160
I think the first thing to recognize is that it's not the end of the world.

06:24.160 --> 06:27.940
You correct yourself and move on or you accept the correction and move on.

06:27.940 --> 06:28.940
Not according to Twitter.

06:28.940 --> 06:32.480
There are unironically people out there who think that using the wrong pronouns is a slur

06:32.480 --> 06:35.280
on par or worse than various racial slurs.

06:35.280 --> 06:36.280
Yeah.

06:36.280 --> 06:42.640
And another tip for you to remember their pronoun next time, it's in your mind.

06:42.680 --> 06:47.760
You want to go through a progression of three good things about the person using their pronouns.

06:47.760 --> 06:54.080
So let's say the person chooses to use they, then you will in your mind go, they have a

06:54.080 --> 06:55.080
nice shirt.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.600
Hey, the pronoun is they, not day.

06:57.600 --> 06:58.600
Are you misgendering?

06:58.600 --> 07:04.480
What would I do if I want to know someone's gender identity or pronouns?

07:04.480 --> 07:11.060
The most important thing is do not pressure anybody into giving you their pronouns.

07:11.100 --> 07:15.100
Some people may be going through the process of discovery and they are not ready yet to

07:15.100 --> 07:17.020
tell you what their pronouns are.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.020
And that's okay.

07:18.020 --> 07:21.860
Wait, if that's the case, until they figure it out, how do I refer to them?

07:21.860 --> 07:23.540
I mean, we all know what the answer actually is.

07:23.540 --> 07:24.720
You return to intuition.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.400
That's the answer for all of this nonsense.

07:26.400 --> 07:30.400
But workshops like this are explicitly meant to override intuition.

07:30.400 --> 07:34.380
Like if your intuition tells you that the it is ma'am person is not a woman, but a man

07:34.380 --> 07:35.380
in a dress.

07:35.380 --> 07:38.120
The point of these workshops is to say, no, intuition is wrong.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.300
It will lead you to misgender and insult people.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.700
Therefore, you must use this rationalistic set of rules instead.

07:43.700 --> 07:48.340
But because the rules create more edge cases as they try to cover up previous ones, you're

07:48.340 --> 07:50.500
likely to just default to intuition anyway.

07:50.500 --> 07:55.340
Just to share something with you that happened the other day at a kukat I was at.

07:55.340 --> 08:04.340
We were talking about pronouns and somebody was disagreeing with how different people

08:04.340 --> 08:06.860
see themselves as different pronouns.

08:06.860 --> 08:13.100
And the argument was, if you look like a female, then it's she her because that's what's normal.

08:13.100 --> 08:16.880
And if you make me call you something else, then you're infringing on my rights.

08:16.880 --> 08:22.300
And I was really taken aback by the comment and I really wasn't sure how to respond.

08:22.300 --> 08:29.860
And the only thing I could really think quickly to say was, it's not about you at all.

08:29.860 --> 08:33.620
And it's mostly and ultimately about respect.

08:33.620 --> 08:34.940
And this is what I mean.

08:35.020 --> 08:37.740
The guy she's talking about is making the intuitive argument.

08:37.740 --> 08:39.660
And she's saying, no, it's about respect.

08:39.660 --> 08:42.420
But there isn't really a respectful non-intuitive option here.

08:42.420 --> 08:46.100
Also, none of you even noticed that I just referred to this person with she without her

08:46.100 --> 08:48.100
even giving her pronouns in the video.

08:48.100 --> 08:50.780
That's how deep intuition on gender runs.

08:50.780 --> 08:56.900
What I would have said to help them understand better is to talk about mispronouncing names.

08:56.900 --> 09:01.660
For example, my name is Johnny spelled J-O-N-Y.

09:01.660 --> 09:05.900
And it's normal for someone to pronounce my name like Joni.

09:05.900 --> 09:12.180
But if I were to tell you over and over again, my name is Joni and you insist on mispronouncing

09:12.180 --> 09:16.280
my name, I would feel disrespected by you.

09:16.280 --> 09:21.480
Some names are very difficult to pronounce, but you know what is very easy to pronounce?

09:21.480 --> 09:23.320
She he they.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.860
Names aren't pronouns.

09:24.860 --> 09:29.180
In fact, names are fundamentally different from all other qualities we have about ourselves.

09:29.180 --> 09:32.900
I'm referring back again to the Dr. Thomas Bogardus prop logic that I went over in my

09:32.900 --> 09:34.940
Are Trans Women Actually Women video.

09:34.940 --> 09:37.500
You can't be a thing by identifying as it.

09:37.500 --> 09:41.540
There has to be an underlying objective reality that your identification attaches to, to make

09:41.540 --> 09:42.540
it valid.

09:42.540 --> 09:43.540
I'm a short guy, 5'7".

09:43.540 --> 09:45.380
I can identify as tall, but it doesn't make me tall.

09:45.380 --> 09:48.820
I could be tall and identify as short, but I would still be tall.

09:48.820 --> 09:50.820
Reality is distinct from identification.

09:50.820 --> 09:53.080
This works for all possible attributes about you.

09:53.080 --> 09:55.260
You can identify as being rich, but not be rich.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.260
You can be rich, but not identify as being rich.

09:57.260 --> 09:58.340
It's the same thing.

09:58.340 --> 10:02.820
Of course, you can become rich, but that involves changing the reality as well, not

10:02.820 --> 10:03.820
just your identification.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.700
And this is how it is with gender too.

10:05.700 --> 10:08.920
You can identify as being a woman, while not being a woman.

10:08.920 --> 10:12.300
The self-ID view of gender is fundamentally broken.

10:12.300 --> 10:16.180
Oftentimes trans activists will say, like they did in that clip, that your name is simply

10:16.180 --> 10:17.280
a self-identifier.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.280
And you can choose your name.

10:18.280 --> 10:19.340
It can be anything you want.

10:19.340 --> 10:22.360
And it will always still refer to the same thing in reality, you.

10:22.360 --> 10:23.760
But names are fundamentally different.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.540
A name is, by definition, what you want it to be.

10:26.540 --> 10:30.020
But that's not how it is with your sex, or your age, or your height, or your occupation,

10:30.020 --> 10:31.140
or anything else about you.

10:31.140 --> 10:34.700
All of those other things refer to qualities that exist outside of you.

10:34.700 --> 10:39.980
When you self-ID as tall, the quality of tall does not exist only in you, it exists also

10:39.980 --> 10:43.340
in other people, and therefore it's outside of the domain of your control.

10:43.340 --> 10:46.960
Same with gender, which is why you're not a woman solely for identifying as one.

10:46.960 --> 10:51.500
But a name refers to a quality that only exists inside of you, and therefore you have total

10:51.500 --> 10:52.500
control over it.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.400
That quality being your sense of self.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.300
This also loops back around to intuition.

10:56.300 --> 10:59.900
Your gender is not something under direct and total control of you.

10:59.900 --> 11:03.240
It also exists in the minds of other people, as their perception of you.

11:03.240 --> 11:07.780
So when I call Lilith, a trans woman, a she, that tells you some information about her,

11:07.780 --> 11:10.600
but it also tells you some information about my perception of her.

11:10.600 --> 11:14.700
Which is why being a polite, decent human being means respecting the pronouns of trans

11:14.700 --> 11:15.800
people in your life.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.280
It shows them that you have a positive perception of them.

11:18.280 --> 11:21.720
But this is also why you should not be forced to use the pronouns that they want you to

11:21.720 --> 11:25.760
use, and that the act of them giving those pronouns is also unreasonable.

11:25.760 --> 11:29.680
Your perception is yours, not theirs, and you have the right to be rude if you want

11:29.680 --> 11:30.680
to be.

11:30.680 --> 11:31.680
That's not up to them.

11:31.680 --> 11:34.680
And the trans activist attempt to make it up to them amounts to other people controlling

11:34.680 --> 11:38.140
what you say about them when they're not even in the room, because you generally don't

11:38.140 --> 11:41.540
use a person's pronouns to their face, that's also kind of rude, for reasons of political

11:41.540 --> 11:42.540
correctness.

11:42.540 --> 11:47.980
This is why I said in yesterday's video that LGBTQ ideology is in a sense totalitarian.

11:47.980 --> 11:52.460
Because its most extreme variant requires everyone to believe that it's the truth.

11:52.460 --> 11:57.040
This is also why people like Jordan Peterson got so up in arms about Bill C-16 in Canada

11:57.040 --> 11:58.400
back in 2017.

11:58.400 --> 12:01.800
It was Peterson's belief that adding gender identity and gender expression to Canada's

12:01.800 --> 12:05.600
list of prohibited grounds of discrimination in the Canadian Human Rights Act would compel

12:05.600 --> 12:09.780
people to use trans people's chosen names and preferred pronouns under threat of legal

12:09.780 --> 12:10.780
punishment.

12:10.780 --> 12:14.580
It turns out that five years later, Jordan Peterson wasn't entirely correct on his

12:14.580 --> 12:16.260
interpretation of that law.

12:16.260 --> 12:20.820
The law that was amended by Bill C-16 governed specific types of relationships.

12:20.820 --> 12:24.980
For example, it made it illegal for an employer to fire a trans person for being trans, in

12:24.980 --> 12:27.980
the same way that you can't fire a black person for being black.

12:27.980 --> 12:29.040
That seems fair to me.

12:29.040 --> 12:33.220
But it did not compel your average person on the street to be more respectful of a random

12:33.220 --> 12:35.160
trans passerby than anyone else.

12:35.160 --> 12:39.620
Peterson did ultimately testify to the Canadian Senate that the biggest problem with C-16

12:39.620 --> 12:42.660
was that it was poorly worded, and that it might compel speech.

12:42.660 --> 12:44.140
But so far, it hasn't.

12:44.140 --> 12:49.260
It's not actually illegal to misgender people in Canada even though Bill C-16 passed.

12:49.260 --> 12:53.020
Instead, if you do it while firing or evicting a trans person, you're likely going to face

12:53.020 --> 12:54.020
a hate crime lawsuit.

12:54.020 --> 12:56.520
But other than that, you still have free speech.

12:56.520 --> 13:00.580
Let me refer back to that Demon Mama clip I used during Mary Turfmas.

13:00.580 --> 13:04.760
What would be the problem with dear gender?

13:04.760 --> 13:11.380
Can anybody tell me if there would be a problem with dear gender?

13:11.380 --> 13:12.940
Is there anybody who could even do this?

13:12.940 --> 13:15.380
There would be nothing wrong with dear gender.

13:15.380 --> 13:19.240
Do you want to know why there would be no problem with dear gender?

13:19.240 --> 13:28.560
Because gender is a category of self-identification that means what you want it to mean.

13:28.560 --> 13:37.740
And it refers to how you engage socially and how you assert your own identity.

13:37.740 --> 13:45.020
So yeah, it is fair to say that gender is essentially an aesthetic.

13:45.020 --> 13:51.440
There is nothing less valid about dear gender than there is about non-binary gender.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.260
I think this gets at the heart of it.

13:53.260 --> 13:57.620
There is a sizable wing of the trans activists that believes that gender is simply an aesthetic.

13:57.620 --> 14:01.040
And yet it should be respected to the utmost, to the point that you're a transphobe if you

14:01.040 --> 14:02.520
don't respect that aesthetic.

14:02.520 --> 14:05.580
We've moved away from respecting immutable characteristics at this point because those

14:05.580 --> 14:07.020
aren't aesthetics.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.900
Aesthetics are things you can adopt at will.

14:08.900 --> 14:13.400
Why should anything that I can adopt at will be treated with the deepest, most fundamental

14:13.400 --> 14:18.300
respect by my entire society, such that you want to see the lack of that respect criminalized,

14:18.300 --> 14:22.580
all the way down to jail them if they don't use neo or xeno pronouns?

14:22.580 --> 14:25.900
Is it because it makes you feel so good and affirmed, and you're such a soft person that

14:25.900 --> 14:30.340
not being affirmed, or better yet, being treated neutrally makes you feel enraged?

14:30.340 --> 14:33.940
Isn't there a phrase that leftoids have for that, losing privilege feels like oppression?

14:33.940 --> 14:38.420
Aren't you just asking for what you derisively claim liberals want, civility politics?

14:38.420 --> 14:40.220
But okay, let's go along with it.

14:40.220 --> 14:44.320
Anything that anybody can adopt at will should be treated with deep respect, and those who

14:44.320 --> 14:46.600
don't grant that respect should be punished.

14:46.600 --> 14:47.600
Got it.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.680
I do actually think the leftoids think this way, beyond my irony posting, because they

14:50.680 --> 14:51.680
act like it.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.280
They've diluted gender down to a simple fashion choice.

14:54.280 --> 14:58.160
But they often believe that fashion choices should be no grounds to treat anybody differently,

14:58.160 --> 14:59.160
ever.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.240
For example, just look at the nudist activists we've talked about on the channel.

15:01.240 --> 15:04.980
They often believe that all sexual preferences, even when presented publicly and inappropriately,

15:04.980 --> 15:06.440
should be affirmed as well.

15:06.440 --> 15:09.880
And if the pedophiles sneak into the left, this is the vector by which they'll do it.

15:09.880 --> 15:12.900
They treat mental illness the same way.

15:12.900 --> 15:16.820
That holding people with mental problems to any sort of a standard is oppressing them

15:16.820 --> 15:18.860
and failing to affirm their identity.

15:18.860 --> 15:23.060
Basically, even though your average leftist probably doesn't believe in this, or doesn't

15:23.060 --> 15:26.860
even know what I'm talking about, I think, leftist affirmation theory has moved into

15:26.860 --> 15:31.300
a position where, because transness doesn't rely on dysphoria anymore, but instead simply

15:31.300 --> 15:37.060
self-identification, and being anti-bigoted requires affirmation of what is an aesthetic.

15:37.060 --> 15:41.300
The natural end result of this logic is that all aesthetics, all habits, all components

15:41.300 --> 15:45.920
of a person's personality must be affirmed in order to be truly inclusive, and a lack

15:45.920 --> 15:50.960
of affirmation of even the most grotesque qualities must be treated as a form of bigotry.

15:50.960 --> 15:55.560
This is ultimately why I'm against LGBT activism, but not gay or trans people.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.880
Most of them don't think this way, they don't want this shit.

15:57.880 --> 16:02.920
But this is the natural end result of the political ideology that underpins the LGBT

16:02.920 --> 16:03.920
activist movement.

16:03.920 --> 16:06.600
Dylan Burns asked me about this in the TUBcast before, and I didn't quite have a solid

16:07.140 --> 16:08.140
answer for him on the spot.

16:08.140 --> 16:10.140
But after thinking about it and reading some more, now I do.

16:10.140 --> 16:12.860
I guess that's why I was always meant to be an essayist and not a debater.

16:12.860 --> 16:18.760
I'm not LGBT because I oppose LGBT activist ideology, which is rooted in the unrestricted

16:18.760 --> 16:24.060
affirmation of the worst components of every single person, unmoored by any sort of standards

16:24.060 --> 16:28.900
due to the rejection of the previous foundation of immutable conditions, and instead replacing

16:28.900 --> 16:34.480
it with, self-ID is valid, leading to anything, even the worst things, being valid, as long

16:34.480 --> 16:35.940
as you self-ID it.

16:36.280 --> 16:40.080
Most individual trans activists themselves will never claim to actually believe in this,

16:40.080 --> 16:43.220
but it is the natural end result of the self-ID logic.

16:43.220 --> 16:46.700
And as people follow their thoughts through to their natural conclusions, you will see

16:46.700 --> 16:50.400
more and more people publicly take this up in the coming years.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.920
And that's why I think somebody who presents their pronouns to you and demands that you

16:53.920 --> 16:58.060
take them up, rather than working hard to present themselves such that your intuition

16:58.060 --> 17:01.720
will line up with how they want to be viewed, is an unreasonable person.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.560
It's one small component of a much larger problem.

17:04.560 --> 17:07.940
The idea that you should be able to dictate to other people the thoughts they think about

17:07.940 --> 17:12.000
you in their head, or what they say about you in private, because you think self-ID

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
is the highest value.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
But it's not.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.300
I generally make the choice to use trans people's pronouns because I think it's the polite

17:18.300 --> 17:19.300
thing to do.

17:19.300 --> 17:23.680
But I reserve the unrestricted right to revoke that at any time, even at the risk of being

17:23.680 --> 17:25.400
rude or losing a friendship.

17:25.400 --> 17:28.400
Because nobody has that kind of power over me, period.
