1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Trans Women Are Women

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,980
In this year's Christmas video, Merry Turfmas, I put forward the opinion that the trans activist

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,960
position of either you believe trans women are women or you're transphobic is a ridiculous

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,960
one.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,120
The reason it's ridiculous is that it goes beyond asking for tolerance for that liberal

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,380
live-and-let-live ideal and instead aims for ideological colonization.

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,200
If I believed that trans women were men, then the liberal prescription would be something

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,560
like, okay, I can hold that opinion, I can express it, I can institute rules of conduct

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,760
for my private spaces, but I can't barge into a trans woman's private space and call

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,560
her a man there, that's her house, not mine, and I can't try to enforce my views on others

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,880
in the neutral public space through violence or coercion.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,560
Trans activists generally don't agree with that liberal compromise.

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,640
They want everyone to believe, deep down in their heart of hearts, that trans women are

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
women.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,360
That's why they consider not holding to their belief to be bigotry.

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,760
And what logically follows from that position is that treating a trans woman differently

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,960
than cis women in any way also has to be bigotry.

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,840
Because if you're not a bigot, they're the same thing.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,180
There's no reason to treat them differently, even though that belief causes a lot of problems

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,320
in the real world.

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,440
My explanation as to why this is an unreasonable position is that having a belief doesn't mean

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,920
that you hate people who don't share your belief.

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,720
I use the example of religion to make the point.

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,080
You can call me an Islamophobe for harassing Muslims on the street or vandalizing their

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,000
mosques or their private property, but you can't call me an Islamophobe for not believing

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,440
what Muslims believe.

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,160
The same works with transphobia and not believing that trans women are women.

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,720
Among the rightoids, going to somebody's Twitter profile, noticing that the leftoid

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,280
they're arguing with online has pronouns in their bio, and then making a joke about

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,840
it is a pretty common thing to do.

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,160
The joke's got two pretty simple foundations.

32
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,000
The first is that on the internet, it doesn't matter what pronouns you have.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,360
It doesn't matter what your gender or sex is, or your race or anything else.

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,040
On the internet, we're all words on a screen.

35
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,560
The internet isn't a real place.

36
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,500
And the trend over the past couple of decades of bringing more and more of your real life

37
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,420
into the online space makes people seem exceptionally vain.

38
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,020
Millennial edgelords tend to make fun of Zoomer woke-schools for this very thing, not realizing

39
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,940
that they don't actually live in their computer or on their phone.

40
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,700
The second foundation, and this one's probably more important, is that for most people, you

41
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,740
don't actually have to announce your pronouns.

42
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,540
If you look at me, you can tell I'm a man.

43
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,020
You don't need me to say that my pronouns are he-him.

44
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,780
You pick that up just by looking at me.

45
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,100
If you look at Naomi, same thing.

46
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,380
She doesn't need to say that her pronouns are she-her.

47
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,380
And you know what?

48
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,100
This generally works for trans people too.

49
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,140
Blaire White and Buck Angel don't need to inform you what their pronouns are.

50
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,020
That intuitive knowing, where a well-passing, hyper-feminine or hyper-masculine trans person

51
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,860
feels like they should be called by the set of pronouns that is the opposite set attached

52
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,860
to their birth sex.

53
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,220
That's a very common feeling.

54
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,020
So common, in fact, that Ben Shapiro had to actually try to call Blaire White a he, working

55
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,860
against his own intuition for comedic effect.

56
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,160
Which was hilarious to the rest of us.

57
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,440
Intuition rules the day when it comes to pronoun usage.

58
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,220
We default to what feels right.

59
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,120
And when somebody announces their pronouns, like in a Twitter bio, the normie reaction

60
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,980
is to think, why are you saying this?

61
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,600
This isn't information you need to tell me.

62
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,940
This is information that your appearance will show me.

63
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,140
And of course, ruder people might point out the obvious implication.

64
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,660
That if you have to tell people your pronouns, it may be because you can't rely on their

65
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,340
intuition to pick up the signals you've put out there.

66
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,240
And that may be because you have not done a very good job at putting those signals out.

67
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,820
This commonly comes up when the media is discussing trans criminals.

68
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,460
There have been cases where a criminal claims to be trans or non-binary, and the article

69
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,940
is stepping all over itself to use proper pronouns.

70
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,740
Making it halfway illegible if they're respecting neo pronouns, or even sometimes just the singular

71
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,740
they.

72
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,100
Sometimes the media won't show a picture of the criminal in question, because the trans

73
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,660
woman they're talking about is clearly just a guy who hasn't done any transitioning

74
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,660
at all.

75
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,180
Sometimes the media will reveal that the criminal in question is clearly faking their identity

76
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,920
because it's become potentially useful in court to do so in the modern era.

77
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,720
And even then, it's a 50-50 shot on what pronouns the article will choose to use.

78
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,560
However, in the world of normies, most people just don't care.

79
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,400
They still default to what their eyes see.

80
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,720
Blair White's a she and this guy isn't, even if they both claim to be.

81
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,360
None of this pronoun conversation is an issue for them, and every once in a while you'll

82
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,760
see the wokeoids complaining about how much of a not-issue it is.

83
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,440
How transphobic is it that cis people don't put their pronouns in their bio in an effort

84
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,700
to be more inclusive?

85
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,600
How we're heading towards a misgendering crisis simply because your average joe doesn't

86
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,880
talk about any of this shit and just gets on with their day?

87
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,720
How most people don't sign their corporate emails with pronouns, along with their name,

88
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,280
titles, and contact info?

89
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,760
In fact, signing emails with pronouns is a whole other rabbit hole that's come about

90
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,120
in the past five years too.

91
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,120
On the one hand, some people say you should absolutely do it, and it should be pushed

92
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,400
forward positively in the workplace as a component of professional business behavior in the modern

93
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
era.

94
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,680
On the other hand, some people say it's simply performative.

95
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,400
It's straight cis people demanding that gay trans people perform their queerness online,

96
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,920
and that demanding it may inadvertently drag people out of the closet.

97
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,920
But again, most normies don't care.

98
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,360
The push to socially normalize this stuff has largely been received as cringey, especially

99
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
when politicians do it.

100
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,480
I am Kamala Harris, my pronouns are she and her, I am a woman sitting at the table wearing

101
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,240
a blue suit.

102
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,120
Most of the time, a pronouns workshop or seminar, where people go through these rounds of social

103
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,000
normalization, will look and sound something like this.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,760
Hi, my name is Johnny and I use he-him pronouns.

105
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,760
Hi, and I am Conchi and I use she-her pronouns.

106
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,400
And we're here to talk about pronouns.

107
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
What is a pronoun?

108
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,640
A pronoun is how we identify ourselves apart from our name.

109
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,440
And it's also how people refer to us in conversations.

110
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,120
If you work a regular nine to five nowadays, you will likely have to at some point sit

111
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,280
through some god awful sensitivity training where some gormless low IQ diversity hire

112
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,320
will mumble the correct politics at you.

113
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,920
I'm so glad I don't have to do this shit anymore, dude.

114
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,120
Using the right pronouns is a really simple way to affirm someone's identity.

115
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,400
It is a signal of acceptance and respect.

116
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,040
If it's a signal of acceptance and respect, how do we go about creating a safe space for

117
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,680
everybody?

118
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
That's a good question.

119
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,800
A really good way to do that is to use inclusive language.

120
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Instead of saying something like, hey, guys, you can say, hey, everyone or hey, team.

121
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Yeah.

122
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,360
And now that you say that, another way that we could show that we're allies and that we

123
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,800
accept everybody is to maybe include our pronouns in our emails or like we just did, introduce

124
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,760
ourselves using our pronouns.

125
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,640
But what would I do if I misgender someone?

126
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,160
I think the first thing to recognize is that it's not the end of the world.

127
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,940
You correct yourself and move on or you accept the correction and move on.

128
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,940
Not according to Twitter.

129
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,480
There are unironically people out there who think that using the wrong pronouns is a slur

130
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,280
on par or worse than various racial slurs.

131
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
Yeah.

132
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:42,640
And another tip for you to remember their pronoun next time, it's in your mind.

133
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,760
You want to go through a progression of three good things about the person using their pronouns.

134
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:54,080
So let's say the person chooses to use they, then you will in your mind go, they have a

135
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
nice shirt.

136
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,600
Hey, the pronoun is they, not day.

137
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Are you misgendering?

138
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,480
What would I do if I want to know someone's gender identity or pronouns?

139
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:11,060
The most important thing is do not pressure anybody into giving you their pronouns.

140
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,100
Some people may be going through the process of discovery and they are not ready yet to

141
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,020
tell you what their pronouns are.

142
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,020
And that's okay.

143
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,860
Wait, if that's the case, until they figure it out, how do I refer to them?

144
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,540
I mean, we all know what the answer actually is.

145
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,720
You return to intuition.

146
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,400
That's the answer for all of this nonsense.

147
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,400
But workshops like this are explicitly meant to override intuition.

148
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,380
Like if your intuition tells you that the it is ma'am person is not a woman, but a man

149
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,380
in a dress.

150
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,120
The point of these workshops is to say, no, intuition is wrong.

151
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,300
It will lead you to misgender and insult people.

152
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,700
Therefore, you must use this rationalistic set of rules instead.

153
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,340
But because the rules create more edge cases as they try to cover up previous ones, you're

154
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,500
likely to just default to intuition anyway.

155
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,340
Just to share something with you that happened the other day at a kukat I was at.

156
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:04,340
We were talking about pronouns and somebody was disagreeing with how different people

157
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,860
see themselves as different pronouns.

158
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:13,100
And the argument was, if you look like a female, then it's she her because that's what's normal.

159
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,880
And if you make me call you something else, then you're infringing on my rights.

160
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,300
And I was really taken aback by the comment and I really wasn't sure how to respond.

161
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:29,860
And the only thing I could really think quickly to say was, it's not about you at all.

162
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,620
And it's mostly and ultimately about respect.

163
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,940
And this is what I mean.

164
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,740
The guy she's talking about is making the intuitive argument.

165
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,660
And she's saying, no, it's about respect.

166
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,420
But there isn't really a respectful non-intuitive option here.

167
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,100
Also, none of you even noticed that I just referred to this person with she without her

168
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,100
even giving her pronouns in the video.

169
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,780
That's how deep intuition on gender runs.

170
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:56,900
What I would have said to help them understand better is to talk about mispronouncing names.

171
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,660
For example, my name is Johnny spelled J-O-N-Y.

172
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,900
And it's normal for someone to pronounce my name like Joni.

173
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:12,180
But if I were to tell you over and over again, my name is Joni and you insist on mispronouncing

174
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,280
my name, I would feel disrespected by you.

175
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,480
Some names are very difficult to pronounce, but you know what is very easy to pronounce?

176
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,320
She he they.

177
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,860
Names aren't pronouns.

178
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,180
In fact, names are fundamentally different from all other qualities we have about ourselves.

179
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,900
I'm referring back again to the Dr. Thomas Bogardus prop logic that I went over in my

180
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,940
Are Trans Women Actually Women video.

181
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,500
You can't be a thing by identifying as it.

182
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,540
There has to be an underlying objective reality that your identification attaches to, to make

183
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,540
it valid.

184
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,540
I'm a short guy, 5'7".

185
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,380
I can identify as tall, but it doesn't make me tall.

186
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,820
I could be tall and identify as short, but I would still be tall.

187
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
Reality is distinct from identification.

188
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,080
This works for all possible attributes about you.

189
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,260
You can identify as being rich, but not be rich.

190
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,260
You can be rich, but not identify as being rich.

191
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,340
It's the same thing.

192
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,820
Of course, you can become rich, but that involves changing the reality as well, not

193
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,820
just your identification.

194
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,700
And this is how it is with gender too.

195
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,920
You can identify as being a woman, while not being a woman.

196
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,300
The self-ID view of gender is fundamentally broken.

197
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,180
Oftentimes trans activists will say, like they did in that clip, that your name is simply

198
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,280
a self-identifier.

199
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
And you can choose your name.

200
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,340
It can be anything you want.

201
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,360
And it will always still refer to the same thing in reality, you.

202
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,760
But names are fundamentally different.

203
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,540
A name is, by definition, what you want it to be.

204
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,020
But that's not how it is with your sex, or your age, or your height, or your occupation,

205
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,140
or anything else about you.

206
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,700
All of those other things refer to qualities that exist outside of you.

207
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,980
When you self-ID as tall, the quality of tall does not exist only in you, it exists also

208
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,340
in other people, and therefore it's outside of the domain of your control.

209
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,960
Same with gender, which is why you're not a woman solely for identifying as one.

210
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,500
But a name refers to a quality that only exists inside of you, and therefore you have total

211
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,500
control over it.

212
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,400
That quality being your sense of self.

213
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,300
This also loops back around to intuition.

214
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,900
Your gender is not something under direct and total control of you.

215
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,240
It also exists in the minds of other people, as their perception of you.

216
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,780
So when I call Lilith, a trans woman, a she, that tells you some information about her,

217
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,600
but it also tells you some information about my perception of her.

218
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,700
Which is why being a polite, decent human being means respecting the pronouns of trans

219
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,800
people in your life.

220
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,280
It shows them that you have a positive perception of them.

221
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,720
But this is also why you should not be forced to use the pronouns that they want you to

222
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,760
use, and that the act of them giving those pronouns is also unreasonable.

223
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,680
Your perception is yours, not theirs, and you have the right to be rude if you want

224
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,680
to be.

225
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,680
That's not up to them.

226
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,680
And the trans activist attempt to make it up to them amounts to other people controlling

227
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,140
what you say about them when they're not even in the room, because you generally don't

228
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,540
use a person's pronouns to their face, that's also kind of rude, for reasons of political

229
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,540
correctness.

230
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,980
This is why I said in yesterday's video that LGBTQ ideology is in a sense totalitarian.

231
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,460
Because its most extreme variant requires everyone to believe that it's the truth.

232
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,040
This is also why people like Jordan Peterson got so up in arms about Bill C-16 in Canada

233
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,400
back in 2017.

234
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,800
It was Peterson's belief that adding gender identity and gender expression to Canada's

235
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,600
list of prohibited grounds of discrimination in the Canadian Human Rights Act would compel

236
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,780
people to use trans people's chosen names and preferred pronouns under threat of legal

237
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,780
punishment.

238
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,580
It turns out that five years later, Jordan Peterson wasn't entirely correct on his

239
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,260
interpretation of that law.

240
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,820
The law that was amended by Bill C-16 governed specific types of relationships.

241
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,980
For example, it made it illegal for an employer to fire a trans person for being trans, in

242
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,980
the same way that you can't fire a black person for being black.

243
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,040
That seems fair to me.

244
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,220
But it did not compel your average person on the street to be more respectful of a random

245
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,160
trans passerby than anyone else.

246
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,620
Peterson did ultimately testify to the Canadian Senate that the biggest problem with C-16

247
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,660
was that it was poorly worded, and that it might compel speech.

248
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,140
But so far, it hasn't.

249
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:49,260
It's not actually illegal to misgender people in Canada even though Bill C-16 passed.

250
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,020
Instead, if you do it while firing or evicting a trans person, you're likely going to face

251
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,020
a hate crime lawsuit.

252
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,520
But other than that, you still have free speech.

253
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,580
Let me refer back to that Demon Mama clip I used during Mary Turfmas.

254
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,760
What would be the problem with dear gender?

255
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:11,380
Can anybody tell me if there would be a problem with dear gender?

256
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,940
Is there anybody who could even do this?

257
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,380
There would be nothing wrong with dear gender.

258
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,240
Do you want to know why there would be no problem with dear gender?

259
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:28,560
Because gender is a category of self-identification that means what you want it to mean.

260
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:37,740
And it refers to how you engage socially and how you assert your own identity.

261
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:45,020
So yeah, it is fair to say that gender is essentially an aesthetic.

262
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:51,440
There is nothing less valid about dear gender than there is about non-binary gender.

263
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,260
I think this gets at the heart of it.

264
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,620
There is a sizable wing of the trans activists that believes that gender is simply an aesthetic.

265
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,040
And yet it should be respected to the utmost, to the point that you're a transphobe if you

266
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,520
don't respect that aesthetic.

267
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,580
We've moved away from respecting immutable characteristics at this point because those

268
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,020
aren't aesthetics.

269
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,900
Aesthetics are things you can adopt at will.

270
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,400
Why should anything that I can adopt at will be treated with the deepest, most fundamental

271
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,300
respect by my entire society, such that you want to see the lack of that respect criminalized,

272
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,580
all the way down to jail them if they don't use neo or xeno pronouns?

273
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,900
Is it because it makes you feel so good and affirmed, and you're such a soft person that

274
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:30,340
not being affirmed, or better yet, being treated neutrally makes you feel enraged?

275
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,940
Isn't there a phrase that leftoids have for that, losing privilege feels like oppression?

276
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,420
Aren't you just asking for what you derisively claim liberals want, civility politics?

277
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,220
But okay, let's go along with it.

278
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,320
Anything that anybody can adopt at will should be treated with deep respect, and those who

279
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,600
don't grant that respect should be punished.

280
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Got it.

281
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,680
I do actually think the leftoids think this way, beyond my irony posting, because they

282
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,680
act like it.

283
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,280
They've diluted gender down to a simple fashion choice.

284
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,160
But they often believe that fashion choices should be no grounds to treat anybody differently,

285
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
ever.

286
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,240
For example, just look at the nudist activists we've talked about on the channel.

287
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,980
They often believe that all sexual preferences, even when presented publicly and inappropriately,

288
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,440
should be affirmed as well.

289
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,880
And if the pedophiles sneak into the left, this is the vector by which they'll do it.

290
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,900
They treat mental illness the same way.

291
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,820
That holding people with mental problems to any sort of a standard is oppressing them

292
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,860
and failing to affirm their identity.

293
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,060
Basically, even though your average leftist probably doesn't believe in this, or doesn't

294
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,860
even know what I'm talking about, I think, leftist affirmation theory has moved into

295
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,300
a position where, because transness doesn't rely on dysphoria anymore, but instead simply

296
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:37,060
self-identification, and being anti-bigoted requires affirmation of what is an aesthetic.

297
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,300
The natural end result of this logic is that all aesthetics, all habits, all components

298
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,920
of a person's personality must be affirmed in order to be truly inclusive, and a lack

299
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,960
of affirmation of even the most grotesque qualities must be treated as a form of bigotry.

300
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,560
This is ultimately why I'm against LGBT activism, but not gay or trans people.

301
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,880
Most of them don't think this way, they don't want this shit.

302
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,920
But this is the natural end result of the political ideology that underpins the LGBT

303
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,920
activist movement.

304
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,600
Dylan Burns asked me about this in the TUBcast before, and I didn't quite have a solid

305
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,140
answer for him on the spot.

306
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,140
But after thinking about it and reading some more, now I do.

307
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,860
I guess that's why I was always meant to be an essayist and not a debater.

308
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:18,760
I'm not LGBT because I oppose LGBT activist ideology, which is rooted in the unrestricted

309
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,060
affirmation of the worst components of every single person, unmoored by any sort of standards

310
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,900
due to the rejection of the previous foundation of immutable conditions, and instead replacing

311
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:34,480
it with, self-ID is valid, leading to anything, even the worst things, being valid, as long

312
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,940
as you self-ID it.

313
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,080
Most individual trans activists themselves will never claim to actually believe in this,

314
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,220
but it is the natural end result of the self-ID logic.

315
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,700
And as people follow their thoughts through to their natural conclusions, you will see

316
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,400
more and more people publicly take this up in the coming years.

317
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,920
And that's why I think somebody who presents their pronouns to you and demands that you

318
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,060
take them up, rather than working hard to present themselves such that your intuition

319
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,720
will line up with how they want to be viewed, is an unreasonable person.

320
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,560
It's one small component of a much larger problem.

321
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,940
The idea that you should be able to dictate to other people the thoughts they think about

322
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,000
you in their head, or what they say about you in private, because you think self-ID

323
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
is the highest value.

324
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But it's not.

325
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,300
I generally make the choice to use trans people's pronouns because I think it's the polite

326
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,300
thing to do.

327
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,680
But I reserve the unrestricted right to revoke that at any time, even at the risk of being

328
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,400
rude or losing a friendship.

329
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Because nobody has that kind of power over me, period.
