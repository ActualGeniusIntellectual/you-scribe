0	5680	Trans Women Are Women
5680	10980	In this year's Christmas video, Merry Turfmas, I put forward the opinion that the trans activist
10980	15960	position of either you believe trans women are women or you're transphobic is a ridiculous
15960	16960	one.
16960	20120	The reason it's ridiculous is that it goes beyond asking for tolerance for that liberal
20120	24380	live-and-let-live ideal and instead aims for ideological colonization.
24380	28200	If I believed that trans women were men, then the liberal prescription would be something
28200	32560	like, okay, I can hold that opinion, I can express it, I can institute rules of conduct
32560	36760	for my private spaces, but I can't barge into a trans woman's private space and call
36760	41560	her a man there, that's her house, not mine, and I can't try to enforce my views on others
41560	44880	in the neutral public space through violence or coercion.
44880	48560	Trans activists generally don't agree with that liberal compromise.
48560	52640	They want everyone to believe, deep down in their heart of hearts, that trans women are
52640	53640	women.
53640	56360	That's why they consider not holding to their belief to be bigotry.
56360	59760	And what logically follows from that position is that treating a trans woman differently
59760	62960	than cis women in any way also has to be bigotry.
62960	64840	Because if you're not a bigot, they're the same thing.
64840	68180	There's no reason to treat them differently, even though that belief causes a lot of problems
68180	69320	in the real world.
69320	74440	My explanation as to why this is an unreasonable position is that having a belief doesn't mean
74440	76920	that you hate people who don't share your belief.
76920	78720	I use the example of religion to make the point.
78720	82080	You can call me an Islamophobe for harassing Muslims on the street or vandalizing their
82080	86000	mosques or their private property, but you can't call me an Islamophobe for not believing
86040	87440	what Muslims believe.
87440	91160	The same works with transphobia and not believing that trans women are women.
91160	94720	Among the rightoids, going to somebody's Twitter profile, noticing that the leftoid
94720	98280	they're arguing with online has pronouns in their bio, and then making a joke about
98280	99840	it is a pretty common thing to do.
99840	102160	The joke's got two pretty simple foundations.
102160	105000	The first is that on the internet, it doesn't matter what pronouns you have.
105000	108360	It doesn't matter what your gender or sex is, or your race or anything else.
108360	110040	On the internet, we're all words on a screen.
110040	111560	The internet isn't a real place.
111560	115500	And the trend over the past couple of decades of bringing more and more of your real life
115500	119420	into the online space makes people seem exceptionally vain.
119420	124020	Millennial edgelords tend to make fun of Zoomer woke-schools for this very thing, not realizing
124020	126940	that they don't actually live in their computer or on their phone.
126940	130700	The second foundation, and this one's probably more important, is that for most people, you
130700	132740	don't actually have to announce your pronouns.
132740	134540	If you look at me, you can tell I'm a man.
134540	137020	You don't need me to say that my pronouns are he-him.
137020	138780	You pick that up just by looking at me.
138780	140100	If you look at Naomi, same thing.
140100	142380	She doesn't need to say that her pronouns are she-her.
142380	143380	And you know what?
143380	145100	This generally works for trans people too.
145100	149140	Blaire White and Buck Angel don't need to inform you what their pronouns are.
149140	154020	That intuitive knowing, where a well-passing, hyper-feminine or hyper-masculine trans person
154020	157860	feels like they should be called by the set of pronouns that is the opposite set attached
157860	158860	to their birth sex.
158860	160220	That's a very common feeling.
160220	165020	So common, in fact, that Ben Shapiro had to actually try to call Blaire White a he, working
165020	167860	against his own intuition for comedic effect.
167860	170160	Which was hilarious to the rest of us.
170160	172440	Intuition rules the day when it comes to pronoun usage.
172440	174220	We default to what feels right.
174220	178120	And when somebody announces their pronouns, like in a Twitter bio, the normie reaction
178120	179980	is to think, why are you saying this?
179980	181600	This isn't information you need to tell me.
181600	183940	This is information that your appearance will show me.
183940	187140	And of course, ruder people might point out the obvious implication.
187140	191660	That if you have to tell people your pronouns, it may be because you can't rely on their
191660	194340	intuition to pick up the signals you've put out there.
194340	198240	And that may be because you have not done a very good job at putting those signals out.
198240	201820	This commonly comes up when the media is discussing trans criminals.
201820	205460	There have been cases where a criminal claims to be trans or non-binary, and the article
205460	207940	is stepping all over itself to use proper pronouns.
207940	212740	Making it halfway illegible if they're respecting neo pronouns, or even sometimes just the singular
212740	213740	they.
213740	217100	Sometimes the media won't show a picture of the criminal in question, because the trans
217100	220660	woman they're talking about is clearly just a guy who hasn't done any transitioning
220660	221660	at all.
221660	225180	Sometimes the media will reveal that the criminal in question is clearly faking their identity
225180	228920	because it's become potentially useful in court to do so in the modern era.
228920	232720	And even then, it's a 50-50 shot on what pronouns the article will choose to use.
232720	235560	However, in the world of normies, most people just don't care.
235560	237400	They still default to what their eyes see.
237400	240720	Blair White's a she and this guy isn't, even if they both claim to be.
240720	244360	None of this pronoun conversation is an issue for them, and every once in a while you'll
244360	247760	see the wokeoids complaining about how much of a not-issue it is.
247760	251440	How transphobic is it that cis people don't put their pronouns in their bio in an effort
251440	252700	to be more inclusive?
252700	256600	How we're heading towards a misgendering crisis simply because your average joe doesn't
256600	258880	talk about any of this shit and just gets on with their day?
258880	262720	How most people don't sign their corporate emails with pronouns, along with their name,
262720	264280	titles, and contact info?
264280	267760	In fact, signing emails with pronouns is a whole other rabbit hole that's come about
267760	269120	in the past five years too.
269120	272120	On the one hand, some people say you should absolutely do it, and it should be pushed
272120	276400	forward positively in the workplace as a component of professional business behavior in the modern
276400	277400	era.
277400	279680	On the other hand, some people say it's simply performative.
279680	284400	It's straight cis people demanding that gay trans people perform their queerness online,
284400	287920	and that demanding it may inadvertently drag people out of the closet.
287960	289920	But again, most normies don't care.
289920	294360	The push to socially normalize this stuff has largely been received as cringey, especially
294360	295360	when politicians do it.
295360	300480	I am Kamala Harris, my pronouns are she and her, I am a woman sitting at the table wearing
300480	302240	a blue suit.
302240	306120	Most of the time, a pronouns workshop or seminar, where people go through these rounds of social
306120	309000	normalization, will look and sound something like this.
309000	311760	Hi, my name is Johnny and I use he-him pronouns.
311760	314760	Hi, and I am Conchi and I use she-her pronouns.
314760	317400	And we're here to talk about pronouns.
317400	318400	What is a pronoun?
318400	322640	A pronoun is how we identify ourselves apart from our name.
322640	325440	And it's also how people refer to us in conversations.
325440	329120	If you work a regular nine to five nowadays, you will likely have to at some point sit
329120	334280	through some god awful sensitivity training where some gormless low IQ diversity hire
334280	336320	will mumble the correct politics at you.
336320	338920	I'm so glad I don't have to do this shit anymore, dude.
338920	343120	Using the right pronouns is a really simple way to affirm someone's identity.
343120	346400	It is a signal of acceptance and respect.
346400	351040	If it's a signal of acceptance and respect, how do we go about creating a safe space for
351040	352680	everybody?
352680	353680	That's a good question.
353680	356800	A really good way to do that is to use inclusive language.
356800	362800	Instead of saying something like, hey, guys, you can say, hey, everyone or hey, team.
362800	363800	Yeah.
363800	367360	And now that you say that, another way that we could show that we're allies and that we
367360	373800	accept everybody is to maybe include our pronouns in our emails or like we just did, introduce
373800	375760	ourselves using our pronouns.
375760	380640	But what would I do if I misgender someone?
380640	384160	I think the first thing to recognize is that it's not the end of the world.
384160	387940	You correct yourself and move on or you accept the correction and move on.
387940	388940	Not according to Twitter.
388940	392480	There are unironically people out there who think that using the wrong pronouns is a slur
392480	395280	on par or worse than various racial slurs.
395280	396280	Yeah.
396280	402640	And another tip for you to remember their pronoun next time, it's in your mind.
402680	407760	You want to go through a progression of three good things about the person using their pronouns.
407760	414080	So let's say the person chooses to use they, then you will in your mind go, they have a
414080	415080	nice shirt.
415080	417600	Hey, the pronoun is they, not day.
417600	418600	Are you misgendering?
418600	424480	What would I do if I want to know someone's gender identity or pronouns?
424480	431060	The most important thing is do not pressure anybody into giving you their pronouns.
431100	435100	Some people may be going through the process of discovery and they are not ready yet to
435100	437020	tell you what their pronouns are.
437020	438020	And that's okay.
438020	441860	Wait, if that's the case, until they figure it out, how do I refer to them?
441860	443540	I mean, we all know what the answer actually is.
443540	444720	You return to intuition.
444720	446400	That's the answer for all of this nonsense.
446400	450400	But workshops like this are explicitly meant to override intuition.
450400	454380	Like if your intuition tells you that the it is ma'am person is not a woman, but a man
454380	455380	in a dress.
455380	458120	The point of these workshops is to say, no, intuition is wrong.
458120	460300	It will lead you to misgender and insult people.
460500	463700	Therefore, you must use this rationalistic set of rules instead.
463700	468340	But because the rules create more edge cases as they try to cover up previous ones, you're
468340	470500	likely to just default to intuition anyway.
470500	475340	Just to share something with you that happened the other day at a kukat I was at.
475340	484340	We were talking about pronouns and somebody was disagreeing with how different people
484340	486860	see themselves as different pronouns.
486860	493100	And the argument was, if you look like a female, then it's she her because that's what's normal.
493100	496880	And if you make me call you something else, then you're infringing on my rights.
496880	502300	And I was really taken aback by the comment and I really wasn't sure how to respond.
502300	509860	And the only thing I could really think quickly to say was, it's not about you at all.
509860	513620	And it's mostly and ultimately about respect.
513620	514940	And this is what I mean.
515020	517740	The guy she's talking about is making the intuitive argument.
517740	519660	And she's saying, no, it's about respect.
519660	522420	But there isn't really a respectful non-intuitive option here.
522420	526100	Also, none of you even noticed that I just referred to this person with she without her
526100	528100	even giving her pronouns in the video.
528100	530780	That's how deep intuition on gender runs.
530780	536900	What I would have said to help them understand better is to talk about mispronouncing names.
536900	541660	For example, my name is Johnny spelled J-O-N-Y.
541660	545900	And it's normal for someone to pronounce my name like Joni.
545900	552180	But if I were to tell you over and over again, my name is Joni and you insist on mispronouncing
552180	556280	my name, I would feel disrespected by you.
556280	561480	Some names are very difficult to pronounce, but you know what is very easy to pronounce?
561480	563320	She he they.
563320	564860	Names aren't pronouns.
564860	569180	In fact, names are fundamentally different from all other qualities we have about ourselves.
569180	572900	I'm referring back again to the Dr. Thomas Bogardus prop logic that I went over in my
572900	574940	Are Trans Women Actually Women video.
574940	577500	You can't be a thing by identifying as it.
577500	581540	There has to be an underlying objective reality that your identification attaches to, to make
581540	582540	it valid.
582540	583540	I'm a short guy, 5'7".
583540	585380	I can identify as tall, but it doesn't make me tall.
585380	588820	I could be tall and identify as short, but I would still be tall.
588820	590820	Reality is distinct from identification.
590820	593080	This works for all possible attributes about you.
593080	595260	You can identify as being rich, but not be rich.
595260	597260	You can be rich, but not identify as being rich.
597260	598340	It's the same thing.
598340	602820	Of course, you can become rich, but that involves changing the reality as well, not
602820	603820	just your identification.
603820	605700	And this is how it is with gender too.
605700	608920	You can identify as being a woman, while not being a woman.
608920	612300	The self-ID view of gender is fundamentally broken.
612300	616180	Oftentimes trans activists will say, like they did in that clip, that your name is simply
616180	617280	a self-identifier.
617280	618280	And you can choose your name.
618280	619340	It can be anything you want.
619340	622360	And it will always still refer to the same thing in reality, you.
622360	623760	But names are fundamentally different.
623760	626540	A name is, by definition, what you want it to be.
626540	630020	But that's not how it is with your sex, or your age, or your height, or your occupation,
630020	631140	or anything else about you.
631140	634700	All of those other things refer to qualities that exist outside of you.
634700	639980	When you self-ID as tall, the quality of tall does not exist only in you, it exists also
639980	643340	in other people, and therefore it's outside of the domain of your control.
643340	646960	Same with gender, which is why you're not a woman solely for identifying as one.
646960	651500	But a name refers to a quality that only exists inside of you, and therefore you have total
651500	652500	control over it.
652500	654400	That quality being your sense of self.
654400	656300	This also loops back around to intuition.
656300	659900	Your gender is not something under direct and total control of you.
659900	663240	It also exists in the minds of other people, as their perception of you.
663240	667780	So when I call Lilith, a trans woman, a she, that tells you some information about her,
667780	670600	but it also tells you some information about my perception of her.
670600	674700	Which is why being a polite, decent human being means respecting the pronouns of trans
674700	675800	people in your life.
675800	678280	It shows them that you have a positive perception of them.
678280	681720	But this is also why you should not be forced to use the pronouns that they want you to
681720	685760	use, and that the act of them giving those pronouns is also unreasonable.
685760	689680	Your perception is yours, not theirs, and you have the right to be rude if you want
689680	690680	to be.
690680	691680	That's not up to them.
691680	694680	And the trans activist attempt to make it up to them amounts to other people controlling
694680	698140	what you say about them when they're not even in the room, because you generally don't
698140	701540	use a person's pronouns to their face, that's also kind of rude, for reasons of political
701540	702540	correctness.
702540	707980	This is why I said in yesterday's video that LGBTQ ideology is in a sense totalitarian.
707980	712460	Because its most extreme variant requires everyone to believe that it's the truth.
712460	717040	This is also why people like Jordan Peterson got so up in arms about Bill C-16 in Canada
717040	718400	back in 2017.
718400	721800	It was Peterson's belief that adding gender identity and gender expression to Canada's
721800	725600	list of prohibited grounds of discrimination in the Canadian Human Rights Act would compel
725600	729780	people to use trans people's chosen names and preferred pronouns under threat of legal
729780	730780	punishment.
730780	734580	It turns out that five years later, Jordan Peterson wasn't entirely correct on his
734580	736260	interpretation of that law.
736260	740820	The law that was amended by Bill C-16 governed specific types of relationships.
740820	744980	For example, it made it illegal for an employer to fire a trans person for being trans, in
744980	747980	the same way that you can't fire a black person for being black.
747980	749040	That seems fair to me.
749040	753220	But it did not compel your average person on the street to be more respectful of a random
753220	755160	trans passerby than anyone else.
755160	759620	Peterson did ultimately testify to the Canadian Senate that the biggest problem with C-16
759620	762660	was that it was poorly worded, and that it might compel speech.
762660	764140	But so far, it hasn't.
764140	769260	It's not actually illegal to misgender people in Canada even though Bill C-16 passed.
769260	773020	Instead, if you do it while firing or evicting a trans person, you're likely going to face
773020	774020	a hate crime lawsuit.
774020	776520	But other than that, you still have free speech.
776520	780580	Let me refer back to that Demon Mama clip I used during Mary Turfmas.
780580	784760	What would be the problem with dear gender?
784760	791380	Can anybody tell me if there would be a problem with dear gender?
791380	792940	Is there anybody who could even do this?
792940	795380	There would be nothing wrong with dear gender.
795380	799240	Do you want to know why there would be no problem with dear gender?
799240	808560	Because gender is a category of self-identification that means what you want it to mean.
808560	817740	And it refers to how you engage socially and how you assert your own identity.
817740	825020	So yeah, it is fair to say that gender is essentially an aesthetic.
825020	831440	There is nothing less valid about dear gender than there is about non-binary gender.
831440	833260	I think this gets at the heart of it.
833260	837620	There is a sizable wing of the trans activists that believes that gender is simply an aesthetic.
837620	841040	And yet it should be respected to the utmost, to the point that you're a transphobe if you
841040	842520	don't respect that aesthetic.
842520	845580	We've moved away from respecting immutable characteristics at this point because those
845580	847020	aren't aesthetics.
847020	848900	Aesthetics are things you can adopt at will.
848900	853400	Why should anything that I can adopt at will be treated with the deepest, most fundamental
853400	858300	respect by my entire society, such that you want to see the lack of that respect criminalized,
858300	862580	all the way down to jail them if they don't use neo or xeno pronouns?
862580	865900	Is it because it makes you feel so good and affirmed, and you're such a soft person that
865900	870340	not being affirmed, or better yet, being treated neutrally makes you feel enraged?
870340	873940	Isn't there a phrase that leftoids have for that, losing privilege feels like oppression?
873940	878420	Aren't you just asking for what you derisively claim liberals want, civility politics?
878420	880220	But okay, let's go along with it.
880220	884320	Anything that anybody can adopt at will should be treated with deep respect, and those who
884320	886600	don't grant that respect should be punished.
886600	887600	Got it.
887600	890680	I do actually think the leftoids think this way, beyond my irony posting, because they
890680	891680	act like it.
891680	894280	They've diluted gender down to a simple fashion choice.
894280	898160	But they often believe that fashion choices should be no grounds to treat anybody differently,
898160	899160	ever.
899160	901240	For example, just look at the nudist activists we've talked about on the channel.
901240	904980	They often believe that all sexual preferences, even when presented publicly and inappropriately,
904980	906440	should be affirmed as well.
906440	909880	And if the pedophiles sneak into the left, this is the vector by which they'll do it.
909880	912900	They treat mental illness the same way.
912900	916820	That holding people with mental problems to any sort of a standard is oppressing them
916820	918860	and failing to affirm their identity.
918860	923060	Basically, even though your average leftist probably doesn't believe in this, or doesn't
923060	926860	even know what I'm talking about, I think, leftist affirmation theory has moved into
926860	931300	a position where, because transness doesn't rely on dysphoria anymore, but instead simply
931300	937060	self-identification, and being anti-bigoted requires affirmation of what is an aesthetic.
937060	941300	The natural end result of this logic is that all aesthetics, all habits, all components
941300	945920	of a person's personality must be affirmed in order to be truly inclusive, and a lack
945920	950960	of affirmation of even the most grotesque qualities must be treated as a form of bigotry.
950960	955560	This is ultimately why I'm against LGBT activism, but not gay or trans people.
955560	957880	Most of them don't think this way, they don't want this shit.
957880	962920	But this is the natural end result of the political ideology that underpins the LGBT
962920	963920	activist movement.
963920	966600	Dylan Burns asked me about this in the TUBcast before, and I didn't quite have a solid
967140	968140	answer for him on the spot.
968140	970140	But after thinking about it and reading some more, now I do.
970140	972860	I guess that's why I was always meant to be an essayist and not a debater.
972860	978760	I'm not LGBT because I oppose LGBT activist ideology, which is rooted in the unrestricted
978760	984060	affirmation of the worst components of every single person, unmoored by any sort of standards
984060	988900	due to the rejection of the previous foundation of immutable conditions, and instead replacing
988900	994480	it with, self-ID is valid, leading to anything, even the worst things, being valid, as long
994480	995940	as you self-ID it.
996280	1000080	Most individual trans activists themselves will never claim to actually believe in this,
1000080	1003220	but it is the natural end result of the self-ID logic.
1003220	1006700	And as people follow their thoughts through to their natural conclusions, you will see
1006700	1010400	more and more people publicly take this up in the coming years.
1010400	1013920	And that's why I think somebody who presents their pronouns to you and demands that you
1013920	1018060	take them up, rather than working hard to present themselves such that your intuition
1018060	1021720	will line up with how they want to be viewed, is an unreasonable person.
1021720	1024560	It's one small component of a much larger problem.
1024560	1027940	The idea that you should be able to dictate to other people the thoughts they think about
1027940	1032000	you in their head, or what they say about you in private, because you think self-ID
1032000	1033000	is the highest value.
1033000	1034000	But it's not.
1034000	1038300	I generally make the choice to use trans people's pronouns because I think it's the polite
1038300	1039300	thing to do.
1039300	1043680	But I reserve the unrestricted right to revoke that at any time, even at the risk of being
1043680	1045400	rude or losing a friendship.
1045400	1048400	Because nobody has that kind of power over me, period.
