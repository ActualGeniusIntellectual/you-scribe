WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.280
So, my last video got copyright struck, no not the April Fools one, though I hope you

00:11.280 --> 00:12.280
enjoyed it.

00:12.280 --> 00:15.120
I told Naomi that you should actually do a VTuber channel, I'd even help her with it,

00:15.120 --> 00:16.560
but it seems like she doesn't want to.

00:16.560 --> 00:18.960
If you want though guys, you can always keep trying to convince her.

00:18.960 --> 00:23.200
No, my last real video, Don't Follow the Trends, got a copyright strike.

00:23.200 --> 00:27.760
It was nominally about Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars, as well as the Chinese

00:27.760 --> 00:28.760
Olympics.

00:28.760 --> 00:33.000
But the actual topic was about the rising expectation of people to engage with society

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
in a certain way.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.500
The whole point of being an outsider, the point of punk to turn a phrase, is to specifically

00:38.500 --> 00:39.640
go against the trend.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.360
There's a meme on the right that if your point of view is parroted by every academic

00:43.360 --> 00:47.580
institution, every government official, every corpo in their HR department, every celebrity

00:47.580 --> 00:51.520
and newscaster, you're not punk, you're not alt, you're not going against the trend,

00:51.520 --> 00:52.520
you are part of it.

00:52.520 --> 00:56.360
At this point though, the video is thankfully back online, but while I was in the middle

00:56.360 --> 00:59.480
of making it, I actually had a hunch that it would catch some heat.

00:59.480 --> 01:03.520
Because I used the full clip of the Will Smith Oscars slap, and I figured that whoever puts

01:03.520 --> 01:06.040
on the Oscars would get their panties in a bunch about it.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.920
But no, it actually wasn't them at all.

01:07.920 --> 01:13.120
Instead it was British GQ, because I used a clip from Helen Lewis' 2018 interview

01:13.120 --> 01:14.220
of Jordan Peterson.

01:14.220 --> 01:18.320
In that interview, no I'm not dumb enough to bring up the clip again, it was an automated

01:18.320 --> 01:19.380
YouTube strike.

01:19.380 --> 01:23.620
Peterson made the point to Lewis that if somebody is fully ideological in their thinking, you

01:23.620 --> 01:27.060
only need to talk to them for a few minutes before you can predict what answers they have

01:27.060 --> 01:28.280
for any given question.

01:28.280 --> 01:31.580
These people aren't actually thinking, they're filtering the inputs you give them through

01:31.580 --> 01:35.140
a lens that distills them down into an ideological talking point.

01:35.140 --> 01:36.780
They're basically running on autopilot.

01:36.780 --> 01:40.980
I liken this to a Markov chain for conversations in the blocked video, in that this type of

01:40.980 --> 01:44.640
thinking is supported by the trending pages on social media, full of meaningless garbage

01:44.640 --> 01:46.280
that nobody actually cares about.

01:46.280 --> 01:50.500
These trending pages promote not just trending topics, both artificial and organic, but also

01:50.500 --> 01:53.080
the idea that everybody must have an opinion on the current thing.

01:53.080 --> 01:57.260
If you don't, then you're not properly engaging with society, and because everything is political,

01:57.260 --> 01:59.000
your neutrality is inherently offensive.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
In other words, refusing to walk the walk, refusing to virtue signal, especially if you

02:03.000 --> 02:07.840
have, say, a large platform, is now considered just as bad as being a legitimate fascist.

02:07.840 --> 02:10.440
At least to the terminally online radical activists.

02:10.440 --> 02:14.360
The reason that I'm rehashing this stuff from the last video isn't just because it got the

02:14.360 --> 02:16.640
ban hammer, and a lot of you probably haven't seen it.

02:16.640 --> 02:20.840
It's also because that lensing idea deserves a bit more exploration than I had the time

02:20.840 --> 02:21.840
to give it.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.560
Here's another video about Will Smith and the trending tab.

02:51.840 --> 02:56.120
These contributions include the subjective theory of value, that the value of an economic

02:56.120 --> 03:00.400
good is not determined by any inherent property, nor by the amount of labor necessary to produce

03:00.400 --> 03:03.760
it, but by the importance the individual places on it for their own ends.

03:03.760 --> 03:07.960
The law of diminishing marginal utility, that the benefit derived from consuming a product,

03:07.960 --> 03:11.320
tends to change depending on how many previous identical products have been consumed.

03:11.320 --> 03:15.280
Like how you might highly enjoy your first piece of cake, only somewhat enjoy your second,

03:15.280 --> 03:18.080
feel neutral about your third, and feel sick after your fourth.

03:18.080 --> 03:22.800
Giving each piece of cake a different subjective value to you, despite being identical products.

03:22.800 --> 03:26.960
And the economic calculation problem, that any centralized redistribution effort lacks

03:26.960 --> 03:30.680
the on-the-ground knowledge to be able to efficiently distribute any commodities, as

03:30.680 --> 03:34.960
the central planners do not have the knowledge or experience that decentralized individuals

03:34.960 --> 03:35.960
do.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.760
In other words, a government can't replicate the total knowledge of every person living

03:38.760 --> 03:42.980
under it, and so a command economy will always be less efficient than a free market.

03:42.980 --> 03:47.080
These are all real innovations in economics, and they all came from the Austrian school.

03:47.080 --> 03:50.640
But as I was talking to a Conoboy about it, I was reminded of this quotation from Frederick

03:50.640 --> 03:51.640
Hayek.

03:51.640 --> 03:55.320
The greatest success of a school is that it stops existing because its fundamental teachings

03:55.320 --> 03:58.240
have become parts of the general body of commonly accepted thought.

03:58.240 --> 04:02.240
Hayek was talking about those Austrian contributions to mainstream econ, because even though they

04:02.240 --> 04:05.920
were formulated by Austrian economics, it turned out that they were so correct that

04:05.920 --> 04:07.960
they just got absorbed by the mainstream of the field.

04:07.960 --> 04:11.480
Let me describe to you a concept that I'm sure somebody else before me has coined it,

04:11.480 --> 04:12.480
but I don't know what it's called.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.120
I call it correct enough.

04:14.160 --> 04:19.120
The truth, the real truth of anything, is almost always entirely incomprehensible by

04:19.120 --> 04:20.280
human minds.

04:20.280 --> 04:22.520
Consider the mug on my desk made of ceramic.

04:22.520 --> 04:25.840
When I'm drinking out of it, it's correct enough for me to consider it an object that

04:25.840 --> 04:27.680
holds liquid, because that's what I'm using it for.

04:27.680 --> 04:30.460
But if I had to describe it to you, that's not correct enough anymore.

04:30.460 --> 04:34.680
I need to tell you roughly its size and shape and color for you to understand the nature

04:34.680 --> 04:35.680
of the mug.

04:35.680 --> 04:39.200
If you wanted to buy an identical mug, this is also not enough information, so I would

04:39.200 --> 04:41.200
also need to tell you the price and where I bought it.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.640
If you wanted a more detailed makeup of the mug, where the ceramic came from, how it was

04:44.640 --> 04:46.960
made, then it's still not correct enough.

04:46.960 --> 04:50.480
To a scientist interested in studying the mug on the atomic level, I would need to zoom

04:50.480 --> 04:54.360
in on the mug so much that we could identify the atoms that the ceramic is composed of

04:54.360 --> 04:58.320
– that would be alumina, rock salt, and magnesium oxide, by the way – and that those

04:58.320 --> 05:02.680
atoms were in fact constantly moving and vibrating around, and that the distinction between the

05:02.680 --> 05:07.800
mug and the non-mug, atomically, is purely conceptual, imposed by my brain for my purposes,

05:07.800 --> 05:10.040
since it's all just atomic particles anyway.

05:10.080 --> 05:14.200
And then, if you wanted to get even more serious, even that's not correct enough.

05:14.200 --> 05:17.120
There's actually no particles out there in the world at all – that's a convenient

05:17.120 --> 05:20.560
fiction that we tell ourselves to be able to get an intuitive handle on physics.

05:20.560 --> 05:24.680
The reality is that it's all just clouds of amplitude that exist within a configuration

05:24.680 --> 05:29.420
space, and what my brain recognizes as a mug is just a large wave function that just so

05:29.420 --> 05:34.000
happened to factorize, having no separate existence any more than anything else does.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.680
The real world is actually pretty unknowable by human standards.

05:36.680 --> 05:39.680
We like to think that we're rational beings that can comprehend anything, but reality

05:39.720 --> 05:42.000
is actually utterly alien to us.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.400
Our senses take in what they can, and we focus on what we desire, because that's the only

05:45.400 --> 05:48.720
way that humans can function, and that's what correct enough means.

05:48.720 --> 05:53.280
It's almost impossible to get anything right, as in, to describe the universe perfectly

05:53.280 --> 05:54.280
accurately.

05:54.280 --> 05:58.480
The amount of information contained within any one thing is theoretically infinite, but

05:58.480 --> 06:02.360
it is entirely within our grasp to get things right, as in, to establish something that

06:02.360 --> 06:05.200
approximates the truth enough that we can use it to achieve our goals.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.120
That's why I don't need to understand quantum mechanics to be able to drink from

06:08.120 --> 06:09.120
my mug.

06:09.560 --> 06:10.680
I don't need to know that it doesn't have a hole in it.

06:10.680 --> 06:13.080
That level of resolution is enough to accomplish my goal.

06:13.080 --> 06:14.680
Hence, it is correct enough.

06:14.680 --> 06:19.000
In general, Newtonian physics works in everyday situations because it's correct enough.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.600
General relativity is more correct, but it's also significantly more detailed.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.600
Check this out.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.120
This was used in one of my psychology classes back in university.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.560
Yes, I know that Jordan Peterson also uses it in one of his lectures.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.760
I didn't actually take his lectures back in the day.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.800
I think this is just a common psych thing.

06:33.800 --> 06:36.840
Depending on what level of resolution you focus on, you can divide this image up into

06:36.840 --> 06:42.080
multiple groupings, and each one feels intuitively correct in your own head as you do so, meaning

06:42.080 --> 06:46.520
that from your perspective, the world appears to change as you change your focus.

06:46.520 --> 06:50.440
And what constitutes correct depends on what level of resolution you're operating on.

06:50.440 --> 06:54.040
All the way down to the makeup of the atoms that constitute this image, if it were printed

06:54.040 --> 06:58.280
on a piece of paper, all the way up to recognizing the image as a single unitary thing, the image,

06:58.280 --> 07:02.600
with no constituent parts, each of these views is correct enough, as long as it aligns with

07:02.600 --> 07:03.600
your purposes.

07:03.600 --> 07:04.960
And it's not just a physics thing.

07:04.960 --> 07:07.680
This is how our brains operate everywhere, all the time.

07:07.680 --> 07:11.320
When primitive tribal people saw an eclipse for the first time, they believed it to be

07:11.320 --> 07:13.040
a mystical divine event.

07:13.040 --> 07:16.960
They were absolutely incorrect, but they were correct enough for their purposes.

07:16.960 --> 07:21.200
The goals of a tribal being to maintain social cohesion, something that a shared religious

07:21.200 --> 07:22.880
narrative can help accomplish.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.800
A pure materialist, a Marxist, let's say, will hear all of this and say that it's all

07:26.800 --> 07:31.600
just chemicals in the brain, so it's not real, it's not worth anything, it's not worth consideration.

07:31.600 --> 07:35.280
Whatever hypocrite that he is, he is depending on chemicals in his brain to tell them that

07:35.280 --> 07:36.940
they are chemicals in the first place.

07:36.940 --> 07:42.080
He is not actually the purely rational, disembodied spirit, caged in a prison of flesh, like he

07:42.080 --> 07:46.520
claims to be, able to peer directly at the nature of the universe, if only he were more

07:46.520 --> 07:47.520
free.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.520
His intelligence is built upon the physical world.

07:49.520 --> 07:53.960
His brain is a thing, after all, and it exists in a physical location where his conscious

07:53.960 --> 07:57.040
experience and mental processing specifically happens.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.280
And so he is also subject to these forces.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.320
He can only ever be correct enough.

08:01.320 --> 08:05.840
For as much as he claims to truly be objective, to truly trust the science, he can only ever

08:05.840 --> 08:07.840
be correct enough.

08:07.840 --> 08:11.980
Remember those Austrian innovations in economics, becoming part of mainstream thought because

08:11.980 --> 08:14.320
they were, let's say, correct enough?

08:14.320 --> 08:18.720
They spoke to an economic truth that wasn't simply a part of any one specific ideology,

08:18.720 --> 08:22.360
but instead was so correct that it became part of the total discipline.

08:22.360 --> 08:25.240
We might say that those innovations transcended their initial resolution.

08:25.240 --> 08:29.140
They didn't only work here, but they also worked there and there and there.

08:29.140 --> 08:32.980
The purpose of a school of thought, whether that's in economics or in physics or in psychology

08:32.980 --> 08:37.300
or philosophy or anywhere else, is to put forward ideas that may not necessarily be

08:37.300 --> 08:40.900
mainstream in the whole of their field, but that contribute to the tapestry of thought

08:40.900 --> 08:42.040
that is the school.

08:42.040 --> 08:46.140
And as Hayek said, when an idea that began in a school sees that much success, it leaves

08:46.140 --> 08:47.820
the school and becomes mainstream.

08:47.820 --> 08:50.620
In other words, it becomes adopted by all the other schools in the field, since evidence

08:50.620 --> 08:51.940
for it is overwhelming.

08:51.940 --> 08:55.380
I think that a school of thought is roughly analogous to what people on the left like

08:55.380 --> 08:56.620
to call a lens.

08:56.620 --> 09:00.180
Remember Destiny saying at one point, on some stream that I can't find, sorry, that

09:00.180 --> 09:04.580
it's useful to understand various lenses, but not to dogmatically hold them because

09:04.580 --> 09:07.980
occasionally looking at an issue through a lens might provide new insight.

09:07.980 --> 09:11.740
In the same vein, it's a good idea to understand multiple schools of thought in a given field,

09:11.740 --> 09:15.580
because if one school of thought can't really tackle a problem, maybe an insight from another

09:15.580 --> 09:16.580
school can help you out.

09:16.580 --> 09:17.580
Here's a great example.

09:17.580 --> 09:21.540
I'm not a progressive or an intersectionalist, but the intersectionalist lens can be useful

09:21.540 --> 09:25.620
at times to view things from a different perspective and gain new information, even if you would

09:25.620 --> 09:28.220
not agree with the prescriptions of that school of thought.

09:28.220 --> 09:32.660
For example, every leftoid screeching about how America is institutionally racist, that

09:32.660 --> 09:37.420
the laws are anti-black, the cops are anti-black, the culture is anti-black, they just seem

09:37.420 --> 09:38.660
to be incorrect.

09:38.660 --> 09:42.860
That doesn't mean that those things didn't once exist, and there hasn't been some snowballing

09:42.860 --> 09:44.260
effects.

09:44.260 --> 09:48.060
Intergenerational wealth is an important part of climbing from working class to middle class,

09:48.060 --> 09:52.380
and if past racism has broken the black family, then that intergenerational wealth doesn't

09:52.380 --> 09:53.460
exist for them.

09:53.460 --> 09:57.980
Even if nobody alive now actually committed any of those acts, and the legitimate racism

09:57.980 --> 10:01.080
has been removed from the legal system, that doesn't mean that black people don't still

10:01.080 --> 10:03.060
face some kind of uphill battle.

10:03.060 --> 10:07.420
In the same vein, I'm not an ANCAP, but I find Hopp's conception of time preference

10:07.420 --> 10:12.620
and his theory of property in a post-scarcity society to be two useful tools to help analyze

10:12.620 --> 10:13.620
other ideas.

10:13.620 --> 10:17.260
For example, one of Hopp's contentions with communism is that there can never truly be

10:17.260 --> 10:23.260
a stateless, moneyless, classless, post-scarcity society, because even if every good and service

10:23.260 --> 10:28.860
are infinite and provided freely, there are still some scarce resources, namely your body,

10:28.860 --> 10:31.840
your time, and downstream from those two, your attention.

10:31.840 --> 10:36.460
You would still need to hold exclusive ownership and domain over those things, and you would

10:36.460 --> 10:40.180
still need to negotiate trade with others who want those things from you.

10:40.180 --> 10:44.680
That requires a conception of property that is not communal in nature, but individualistic,

10:44.680 --> 10:48.260
and everything else that is capitalist flows downstream from that position.

10:48.260 --> 10:52.480
The problem is when you become ideologically attached to one school, one lens, that you

10:52.480 --> 10:56.540
dogmatically filter everything through it without even thinking, and you mindlessly

10:56.540 --> 11:01.000
accept the answer that it spits out without checking whether or not it maps onto reality.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.600
Socialists do this, ANCAPs do this, intersectionalists and progressives do this, religious conservatives

11:05.600 --> 11:06.600
do this.

11:06.600 --> 11:11.620
They all have a rigid set of ideas, books or rules or laws or views that they feed every

11:11.620 --> 11:13.560
possible stimuli into.

11:13.560 --> 11:17.000
How does this relate to the bourgeoisie's class war against the proletariat?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.760
How did state regulation cause this market failure?

11:19.760 --> 11:23.540
How is it a product of a patriarchal society and the privileged power dynamic?

11:23.540 --> 11:25.940
What does Jesus and the Bible have to say about it?

11:25.940 --> 11:31.480
All of these can be useful questions to ask that might provide some insight, but for none

11:31.480 --> 11:36.000
of them is it appropriate to ask them and only ask them, nothing else, every single

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
time.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.360
The proper use for a school of thought isn't to follow it constantly, even when it's obviously

11:40.360 --> 11:41.360
wrong.

11:41.360 --> 11:44.720
The proper use of a lens isn't to keep it hooked up to your eye 24-7.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.680
If you do, that's why you can't understand what's going on around you, you're restricting

11:47.680 --> 11:48.680
your vision.

11:48.680 --> 11:52.520
It's not to understand how these structures work, but to be open to new ideas, it's to

11:52.520 --> 11:56.220
keep them in your back pocket as a potential mode of analysis that might occasionally yield

11:56.220 --> 11:57.280
a good result.

11:57.280 --> 12:01.600
Because you're not a disembodied being looking for the truth, you are not nearly smart enough

12:01.600 --> 12:02.920
for that, none of us are.

12:02.920 --> 12:06.480
You are looking to solve a problem, whatever the problem is, and if a new way of looking

12:06.480 --> 12:09.200
at the problem might help solve it, why wouldn't you do so?

12:09.200 --> 12:12.880
You don't need to follow that way dogmatically, you're not swearing an oath to it, you're

12:12.880 --> 12:13.880
solving a problem.

12:13.880 --> 12:17.000
That was the point of that Helen Lewis Jordan Peterson clip that I used, the one that got

12:17.000 --> 12:18.080
me copyright struck.

12:18.080 --> 12:21.680
Lewis said that she found Peterson confusing because he didn't seem to have an ideology

12:21.680 --> 12:25.960
that he operated from, and Peterson correctly told her that you don't need one, and in fact,

12:25.960 --> 12:28.800
having one basically destroyed her ability to independently think.

12:28.800 --> 12:32.320
He was right, that's how he predicted her responses before she gave them, by simply

12:32.320 --> 12:33.800
adopting her lens.

12:33.800 --> 12:38.440
That's the correct position by the way, don't be ideological, or at least be as non-ideological

12:38.440 --> 12:39.440
as you can.

12:39.440 --> 12:43.080
But as I said at the beginning, if you're not ideological, you are stupidly called a

12:43.080 --> 12:47.680
racist, fascist, bigot, nazi, whatever nowadays with a terminally online radical activists.

12:47.680 --> 12:51.960
They expect an ideology, like Lewis did, they expect you to dance the dance, to perform

12:51.960 --> 12:54.180
for them, and to observe their performances.

12:54.180 --> 12:57.100
Doing so socially signals that you have the correct thoughts, that you're on the right

12:57.100 --> 12:58.100
side of history.

12:58.100 --> 13:01.400
And if you don't, then you're the enemy, because everything is political.

13:01.400 --> 13:05.320
So if you disengage from anything, then you are opposing their politics.

13:05.320 --> 13:08.080
You are the wrench thrown into their next five year plan.

13:08.080 --> 13:11.760
So I'll leave you with the same moral lesson as the last video, since you probably didn't

13:11.760 --> 13:12.760
get to hear it.

13:12.760 --> 13:15.960
Only make a show of caring about something, if you actually care about it.

13:15.960 --> 13:20.280
You have no obligation to care about everything, or anything, regardless of what they say.

13:20.280 --> 13:24.000
And if you do want to resist them, then you have an obligation to be stubborn and obstinate

13:24.000 --> 13:25.120
in your not caring.

13:25.120 --> 13:29.880
The house of cards that they sit atop collapses every time you just say no, so say it loud

13:29.880 --> 13:30.720
and say it proud.
