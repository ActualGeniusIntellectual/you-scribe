0	11280	So, my last video got copyright struck, no not the April Fools one, though I hope you
11280	12280	enjoyed it.
12280	15120	I told Naomi that you should actually do a VTuber channel, I'd even help her with it,
15120	16560	but it seems like she doesn't want to.
16560	18960	If you want though guys, you can always keep trying to convince her.
18960	23200	No, my last real video, Don't Follow the Trends, got a copyright strike.
23200	27760	It was nominally about Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars, as well as the Chinese
27760	28760	Olympics.
28760	33000	But the actual topic was about the rising expectation of people to engage with society
33000	34000	in a certain way.
34000	38500	The whole point of being an outsider, the point of punk to turn a phrase, is to specifically
38500	39640	go against the trend.
39640	43360	There's a meme on the right that if your point of view is parroted by every academic
43360	47580	institution, every government official, every corpo in their HR department, every celebrity
47580	51520	and newscaster, you're not punk, you're not alt, you're not going against the trend,
51520	52520	you are part of it.
52520	56360	At this point though, the video is thankfully back online, but while I was in the middle
56360	59480	of making it, I actually had a hunch that it would catch some heat.
59480	63520	Because I used the full clip of the Will Smith Oscars slap, and I figured that whoever puts
63520	66040	on the Oscars would get their panties in a bunch about it.
66040	67920	But no, it actually wasn't them at all.
67920	73120	Instead it was British GQ, because I used a clip from Helen Lewis' 2018 interview
73120	74220	of Jordan Peterson.
74220	78320	In that interview, no I'm not dumb enough to bring up the clip again, it was an automated
78320	79380	YouTube strike.
79380	83620	Peterson made the point to Lewis that if somebody is fully ideological in their thinking, you
83620	87060	only need to talk to them for a few minutes before you can predict what answers they have
87060	88280	for any given question.
88280	91580	These people aren't actually thinking, they're filtering the inputs you give them through
91580	95140	a lens that distills them down into an ideological talking point.
95140	96780	They're basically running on autopilot.
96780	100980	I liken this to a Markov chain for conversations in the blocked video, in that this type of
100980	104640	thinking is supported by the trending pages on social media, full of meaningless garbage
104640	106280	that nobody actually cares about.
106280	110500	These trending pages promote not just trending topics, both artificial and organic, but also
110500	113080	the idea that everybody must have an opinion on the current thing.
113080	117260	If you don't, then you're not properly engaging with society, and because everything is political,
117260	119000	your neutrality is inherently offensive.
119000	123000	In other words, refusing to walk the walk, refusing to virtue signal, especially if you
123000	127840	have, say, a large platform, is now considered just as bad as being a legitimate fascist.
127840	130440	At least to the terminally online radical activists.
130440	134360	The reason that I'm rehashing this stuff from the last video isn't just because it got the
134360	136640	ban hammer, and a lot of you probably haven't seen it.
136640	140840	It's also because that lensing idea deserves a bit more exploration than I had the time
140840	141840	to give it.
141840	143560	Here's another video about Will Smith and the trending tab.
171840	176120	These contributions include the subjective theory of value, that the value of an economic
176120	180400	good is not determined by any inherent property, nor by the amount of labor necessary to produce
180400	183760	it, but by the importance the individual places on it for their own ends.
183760	187960	The law of diminishing marginal utility, that the benefit derived from consuming a product,
187960	191320	tends to change depending on how many previous identical products have been consumed.
191320	195280	Like how you might highly enjoy your first piece of cake, only somewhat enjoy your second,
195280	198080	feel neutral about your third, and feel sick after your fourth.
198080	202800	Giving each piece of cake a different subjective value to you, despite being identical products.
202800	206960	And the economic calculation problem, that any centralized redistribution effort lacks
206960	210680	the on-the-ground knowledge to be able to efficiently distribute any commodities, as
210680	214960	the central planners do not have the knowledge or experience that decentralized individuals
214960	215960	do.
215960	218760	In other words, a government can't replicate the total knowledge of every person living
218760	222980	under it, and so a command economy will always be less efficient than a free market.
222980	227080	These are all real innovations in economics, and they all came from the Austrian school.
227080	230640	But as I was talking to a Conoboy about it, I was reminded of this quotation from Frederick
230640	231640	Hayek.
231640	235320	The greatest success of a school is that it stops existing because its fundamental teachings
235320	238240	have become parts of the general body of commonly accepted thought.
238240	242240	Hayek was talking about those Austrian contributions to mainstream econ, because even though they
242240	245920	were formulated by Austrian economics, it turned out that they were so correct that
245920	247960	they just got absorbed by the mainstream of the field.
247960	251480	Let me describe to you a concept that I'm sure somebody else before me has coined it,
251480	252480	but I don't know what it's called.
252480	254120	I call it correct enough.
254160	259120	The truth, the real truth of anything, is almost always entirely incomprehensible by
259120	260280	human minds.
260280	262520	Consider the mug on my desk made of ceramic.
262520	265840	When I'm drinking out of it, it's correct enough for me to consider it an object that
265840	267680	holds liquid, because that's what I'm using it for.
267680	270460	But if I had to describe it to you, that's not correct enough anymore.
270460	274680	I need to tell you roughly its size and shape and color for you to understand the nature
274680	275680	of the mug.
275680	279200	If you wanted to buy an identical mug, this is also not enough information, so I would
279200	281200	also need to tell you the price and where I bought it.
281200	284640	If you wanted a more detailed makeup of the mug, where the ceramic came from, how it was
284640	286960	made, then it's still not correct enough.
286960	290480	To a scientist interested in studying the mug on the atomic level, I would need to zoom
290480	294360	in on the mug so much that we could identify the atoms that the ceramic is composed of
294360	298320	– that would be alumina, rock salt, and magnesium oxide, by the way – and that those
298320	302680	atoms were in fact constantly moving and vibrating around, and that the distinction between the
302680	307800	mug and the non-mug, atomically, is purely conceptual, imposed by my brain for my purposes,
307800	310040	since it's all just atomic particles anyway.
310080	314200	And then, if you wanted to get even more serious, even that's not correct enough.
314200	317120	There's actually no particles out there in the world at all – that's a convenient
317120	320560	fiction that we tell ourselves to be able to get an intuitive handle on physics.
320560	324680	The reality is that it's all just clouds of amplitude that exist within a configuration
324680	329420	space, and what my brain recognizes as a mug is just a large wave function that just so
329420	334000	happened to factorize, having no separate existence any more than anything else does.
334000	336680	The real world is actually pretty unknowable by human standards.
336680	339680	We like to think that we're rational beings that can comprehend anything, but reality
339720	342000	is actually utterly alien to us.
342000	345400	Our senses take in what they can, and we focus on what we desire, because that's the only
345400	348720	way that humans can function, and that's what correct enough means.
348720	353280	It's almost impossible to get anything right, as in, to describe the universe perfectly
353280	354280	accurately.
354280	358480	The amount of information contained within any one thing is theoretically infinite, but
358480	362360	it is entirely within our grasp to get things right, as in, to establish something that
362360	365200	approximates the truth enough that we can use it to achieve our goals.
365200	368120	That's why I don't need to understand quantum mechanics to be able to drink from
368120	369120	my mug.
369560	370680	I don't need to know that it doesn't have a hole in it.
370680	373080	That level of resolution is enough to accomplish my goal.
373080	374680	Hence, it is correct enough.
374680	379000	In general, Newtonian physics works in everyday situations because it's correct enough.
379000	382600	General relativity is more correct, but it's also significantly more detailed.
382600	383600	Check this out.
383600	386120	This was used in one of my psychology classes back in university.
386120	389560	Yes, I know that Jordan Peterson also uses it in one of his lectures.
389560	391760	I didn't actually take his lectures back in the day.
391760	393800	I think this is just a common psych thing.
393800	396840	Depending on what level of resolution you focus on, you can divide this image up into
396840	402080	multiple groupings, and each one feels intuitively correct in your own head as you do so, meaning
402080	406520	that from your perspective, the world appears to change as you change your focus.
406520	410440	And what constitutes correct depends on what level of resolution you're operating on.
410440	414040	All the way down to the makeup of the atoms that constitute this image, if it were printed
414040	418280	on a piece of paper, all the way up to recognizing the image as a single unitary thing, the image,
418280	422600	with no constituent parts, each of these views is correct enough, as long as it aligns with
422600	423600	your purposes.
423600	424960	And it's not just a physics thing.
424960	427680	This is how our brains operate everywhere, all the time.
427680	431320	When primitive tribal people saw an eclipse for the first time, they believed it to be
431320	433040	a mystical divine event.
433040	436960	They were absolutely incorrect, but they were correct enough for their purposes.
436960	441200	The goals of a tribal being to maintain social cohesion, something that a shared religious
441200	442880	narrative can help accomplish.
442880	446800	A pure materialist, a Marxist, let's say, will hear all of this and say that it's all
446800	451600	just chemicals in the brain, so it's not real, it's not worth anything, it's not worth consideration.
451600	455280	Whatever hypocrite that he is, he is depending on chemicals in his brain to tell them that
455280	456940	they are chemicals in the first place.
456940	462080	He is not actually the purely rational, disembodied spirit, caged in a prison of flesh, like he
462080	466520	claims to be, able to peer directly at the nature of the universe, if only he were more
466520	467520	free.
467520	469520	His intelligence is built upon the physical world.
469520	473960	His brain is a thing, after all, and it exists in a physical location where his conscious
473960	477040	experience and mental processing specifically happens.
477040	479280	And so he is also subject to these forces.
479280	481320	He can only ever be correct enough.
481320	485840	For as much as he claims to truly be objective, to truly trust the science, he can only ever
485840	487840	be correct enough.
487840	491980	Remember those Austrian innovations in economics, becoming part of mainstream thought because
491980	494320	they were, let's say, correct enough?
494320	498720	They spoke to an economic truth that wasn't simply a part of any one specific ideology,
498720	502360	but instead was so correct that it became part of the total discipline.
502360	505240	We might say that those innovations transcended their initial resolution.
505240	509140	They didn't only work here, but they also worked there and there and there.
509140	512980	The purpose of a school of thought, whether that's in economics or in physics or in psychology
512980	517300	or philosophy or anywhere else, is to put forward ideas that may not necessarily be
517300	520900	mainstream in the whole of their field, but that contribute to the tapestry of thought
520900	522040	that is the school.
522040	526140	And as Hayek said, when an idea that began in a school sees that much success, it leaves
526140	527820	the school and becomes mainstream.
527820	530620	In other words, it becomes adopted by all the other schools in the field, since evidence
530620	531940	for it is overwhelming.
531940	535380	I think that a school of thought is roughly analogous to what people on the left like
535380	536620	to call a lens.
536620	540180	Remember Destiny saying at one point, on some stream that I can't find, sorry, that
540180	544580	it's useful to understand various lenses, but not to dogmatically hold them because
544580	547980	occasionally looking at an issue through a lens might provide new insight.
547980	551740	In the same vein, it's a good idea to understand multiple schools of thought in a given field,
551740	555580	because if one school of thought can't really tackle a problem, maybe an insight from another
555580	556580	school can help you out.
556580	557580	Here's a great example.
557580	561540	I'm not a progressive or an intersectionalist, but the intersectionalist lens can be useful
561540	565620	at times to view things from a different perspective and gain new information, even if you would
565620	568220	not agree with the prescriptions of that school of thought.
568220	572660	For example, every leftoid screeching about how America is institutionally racist, that
572660	577420	the laws are anti-black, the cops are anti-black, the culture is anti-black, they just seem
577420	578660	to be incorrect.
578660	582860	That doesn't mean that those things didn't once exist, and there hasn't been some snowballing
582860	584260	effects.
584260	588060	Intergenerational wealth is an important part of climbing from working class to middle class,
588060	592380	and if past racism has broken the black family, then that intergenerational wealth doesn't
592380	593460	exist for them.
593460	597980	Even if nobody alive now actually committed any of those acts, and the legitimate racism
597980	601080	has been removed from the legal system, that doesn't mean that black people don't still
601080	603060	face some kind of uphill battle.
603060	607420	In the same vein, I'm not an ANCAP, but I find Hopp's conception of time preference
607420	612620	and his theory of property in a post-scarcity society to be two useful tools to help analyze
612620	613620	other ideas.
613620	617260	For example, one of Hopp's contentions with communism is that there can never truly be
617260	623260	a stateless, moneyless, classless, post-scarcity society, because even if every good and service
623260	628860	are infinite and provided freely, there are still some scarce resources, namely your body,
628860	631840	your time, and downstream from those two, your attention.
631840	636460	You would still need to hold exclusive ownership and domain over those things, and you would
636460	640180	still need to negotiate trade with others who want those things from you.
640180	644680	That requires a conception of property that is not communal in nature, but individualistic,
644680	648260	and everything else that is capitalist flows downstream from that position.
648260	652480	The problem is when you become ideologically attached to one school, one lens, that you
652480	656540	dogmatically filter everything through it without even thinking, and you mindlessly
656540	661000	accept the answer that it spits out without checking whether or not it maps onto reality.
661000	665600	Socialists do this, ANCAPs do this, intersectionalists and progressives do this, religious conservatives
665600	666600	do this.
666600	671620	They all have a rigid set of ideas, books or rules or laws or views that they feed every
671620	673560	possible stimuli into.
673560	677000	How does this relate to the bourgeoisie's class war against the proletariat?
677000	679760	How did state regulation cause this market failure?
679760	683540	How is it a product of a patriarchal society and the privileged power dynamic?
683540	685940	What does Jesus and the Bible have to say about it?
685940	691480	All of these can be useful questions to ask that might provide some insight, but for none
691480	696000	of them is it appropriate to ask them and only ask them, nothing else, every single
696000	697000	time.
697000	700360	The proper use for a school of thought isn't to follow it constantly, even when it's obviously
700360	701360	wrong.
701360	704720	The proper use of a lens isn't to keep it hooked up to your eye 24-7.
704720	707680	If you do, that's why you can't understand what's going on around you, you're restricting
707680	708680	your vision.
708680	712520	It's not to understand how these structures work, but to be open to new ideas, it's to
712520	716220	keep them in your back pocket as a potential mode of analysis that might occasionally yield
716220	717280	a good result.
717280	721600	Because you're not a disembodied being looking for the truth, you are not nearly smart enough
721600	722920	for that, none of us are.
722920	726480	You are looking to solve a problem, whatever the problem is, and if a new way of looking
726480	729200	at the problem might help solve it, why wouldn't you do so?
729200	732880	You don't need to follow that way dogmatically, you're not swearing an oath to it, you're
732880	733880	solving a problem.
733880	737000	That was the point of that Helen Lewis Jordan Peterson clip that I used, the one that got
737000	738080	me copyright struck.
738080	741680	Lewis said that she found Peterson confusing because he didn't seem to have an ideology
741680	745960	that he operated from, and Peterson correctly told her that you don't need one, and in fact,
745960	748800	having one basically destroyed her ability to independently think.
748800	752320	He was right, that's how he predicted her responses before she gave them, by simply
752320	753800	adopting her lens.
753800	758440	That's the correct position by the way, don't be ideological, or at least be as non-ideological
758440	759440	as you can.
759440	763080	But as I said at the beginning, if you're not ideological, you are stupidly called a
763080	767680	racist, fascist, bigot, nazi, whatever nowadays with a terminally online radical activists.
767680	771960	They expect an ideology, like Lewis did, they expect you to dance the dance, to perform
771960	774180	for them, and to observe their performances.
774180	777100	Doing so socially signals that you have the correct thoughts, that you're on the right
777100	778100	side of history.
778100	781400	And if you don't, then you're the enemy, because everything is political.
781400	785320	So if you disengage from anything, then you are opposing their politics.
785320	788080	You are the wrench thrown into their next five year plan.
788080	791760	So I'll leave you with the same moral lesson as the last video, since you probably didn't
791760	792760	get to hear it.
792760	795960	Only make a show of caring about something, if you actually care about it.
795960	800280	You have no obligation to care about everything, or anything, regardless of what they say.
800280	804000	And if you do want to resist them, then you have an obligation to be stubborn and obstinate
804000	805120	in your not caring.
805120	809880	The house of cards that they sit atop collapses every time you just say no, so say it loud
809880	810720	and say it proud.
