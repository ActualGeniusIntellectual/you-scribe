1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,280
So, my last video got copyright struck, no not the April Fools one, though I hope you

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,280
enjoyed it.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,120
I told Naomi that you should actually do a VTuber channel, I'd even help her with it,

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,560
but it seems like she doesn't want to.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,960
If you want though guys, you can always keep trying to convince her.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,200
No, my last real video, Don't Follow the Trends, got a copyright strike.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,760
It was nominally about Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars, as well as the Chinese

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,760
Olympics.

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,000
But the actual topic was about the rising expectation of people to engage with society

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
in a certain way.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,500
The whole point of being an outsider, the point of punk to turn a phrase, is to specifically

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,640
go against the trend.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,360
There's a meme on the right that if your point of view is parroted by every academic

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,580
institution, every government official, every corpo in their HR department, every celebrity

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,520
and newscaster, you're not punk, you're not alt, you're not going against the trend,

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,520
you are part of it.

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,360
At this point though, the video is thankfully back online, but while I was in the middle

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,480
of making it, I actually had a hunch that it would catch some heat.

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,520
Because I used the full clip of the Will Smith Oscars slap, and I figured that whoever puts

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,040
on the Oscars would get their panties in a bunch about it.

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,920
But no, it actually wasn't them at all.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,120
Instead it was British GQ, because I used a clip from Helen Lewis' 2018 interview

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,220
of Jordan Peterson.

24
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,320
In that interview, no I'm not dumb enough to bring up the clip again, it was an automated

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,380
YouTube strike.

26
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,620
Peterson made the point to Lewis that if somebody is fully ideological in their thinking, you

27
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,060
only need to talk to them for a few minutes before you can predict what answers they have

28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,280
for any given question.

29
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,580
These people aren't actually thinking, they're filtering the inputs you give them through

30
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,140
a lens that distills them down into an ideological talking point.

31
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,780
They're basically running on autopilot.

32
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,980
I liken this to a Markov chain for conversations in the blocked video, in that this type of

33
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,640
thinking is supported by the trending pages on social media, full of meaningless garbage

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,280
that nobody actually cares about.

35
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,500
These trending pages promote not just trending topics, both artificial and organic, but also

36
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,080
the idea that everybody must have an opinion on the current thing.

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,260
If you don't, then you're not properly engaging with society, and because everything is political,

38
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,000
your neutrality is inherently offensive.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
In other words, refusing to walk the walk, refusing to virtue signal, especially if you

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,840
have, say, a large platform, is now considered just as bad as being a legitimate fascist.

41
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,440
At least to the terminally online radical activists.

42
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,360
The reason that I'm rehashing this stuff from the last video isn't just because it got the

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,640
ban hammer, and a lot of you probably haven't seen it.

44
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,840
It's also because that lensing idea deserves a bit more exploration than I had the time

45
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
to give it.

46
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,560
Here's another video about Will Smith and the trending tab.

47
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,120
These contributions include the subjective theory of value, that the value of an economic

48
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,400
good is not determined by any inherent property, nor by the amount of labor necessary to produce

49
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,760
it, but by the importance the individual places on it for their own ends.

50
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,960
The law of diminishing marginal utility, that the benefit derived from consuming a product,

51
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,320
tends to change depending on how many previous identical products have been consumed.

52
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,280
Like how you might highly enjoy your first piece of cake, only somewhat enjoy your second,

53
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,080
feel neutral about your third, and feel sick after your fourth.

54
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,800
Giving each piece of cake a different subjective value to you, despite being identical products.

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,960
And the economic calculation problem, that any centralized redistribution effort lacks

56
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,680
the on-the-ground knowledge to be able to efficiently distribute any commodities, as

57
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,960
the central planners do not have the knowledge or experience that decentralized individuals

58
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
do.

59
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,760
In other words, a government can't replicate the total knowledge of every person living

60
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,980
under it, and so a command economy will always be less efficient than a free market.

61
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,080
These are all real innovations in economics, and they all came from the Austrian school.

62
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,640
But as I was talking to a Conoboy about it, I was reminded of this quotation from Frederick

63
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
Hayek.

64
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,320
The greatest success of a school is that it stops existing because its fundamental teachings

65
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,240
have become parts of the general body of commonly accepted thought.

66
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,240
Hayek was talking about those Austrian contributions to mainstream econ, because even though they

67
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,920
were formulated by Austrian economics, it turned out that they were so correct that

68
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,960
they just got absorbed by the mainstream of the field.

69
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,480
Let me describe to you a concept that I'm sure somebody else before me has coined it,

70
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,480
but I don't know what it's called.

71
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,120
I call it correct enough.

72
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,120
The truth, the real truth of anything, is almost always entirely incomprehensible by

73
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,280
human minds.

74
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,520
Consider the mug on my desk made of ceramic.

75
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,840
When I'm drinking out of it, it's correct enough for me to consider it an object that

76
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,680
holds liquid, because that's what I'm using it for.

77
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,460
But if I had to describe it to you, that's not correct enough anymore.

78
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,680
I need to tell you roughly its size and shape and color for you to understand the nature

79
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
of the mug.

80
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,200
If you wanted to buy an identical mug, this is also not enough information, so I would

81
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,200
also need to tell you the price and where I bought it.

82
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,640
If you wanted a more detailed makeup of the mug, where the ceramic came from, how it was

83
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,960
made, then it's still not correct enough.

84
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,480
To a scientist interested in studying the mug on the atomic level, I would need to zoom

85
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,360
in on the mug so much that we could identify the atoms that the ceramic is composed of

86
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,320
– that would be alumina, rock salt, and magnesium oxide, by the way – and that those

87
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,680
atoms were in fact constantly moving and vibrating around, and that the distinction between the

88
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,800
mug and the non-mug, atomically, is purely conceptual, imposed by my brain for my purposes,

89
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,040
since it's all just atomic particles anyway.

90
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,200
And then, if you wanted to get even more serious, even that's not correct enough.

91
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,120
There's actually no particles out there in the world at all – that's a convenient

92
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,560
fiction that we tell ourselves to be able to get an intuitive handle on physics.

93
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,680
The reality is that it's all just clouds of amplitude that exist within a configuration

94
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,420
space, and what my brain recognizes as a mug is just a large wave function that just so

95
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,000
happened to factorize, having no separate existence any more than anything else does.

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,680
The real world is actually pretty unknowable by human standards.

97
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,680
We like to think that we're rational beings that can comprehend anything, but reality

98
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,000
is actually utterly alien to us.

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,400
Our senses take in what they can, and we focus on what we desire, because that's the only

100
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,720
way that humans can function, and that's what correct enough means.

101
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,280
It's almost impossible to get anything right, as in, to describe the universe perfectly

102
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
accurately.

103
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,480
The amount of information contained within any one thing is theoretically infinite, but

104
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,360
it is entirely within our grasp to get things right, as in, to establish something that

105
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,200
approximates the truth enough that we can use it to achieve our goals.

106
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,120
That's why I don't need to understand quantum mechanics to be able to drink from

107
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
my mug.

108
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,680
I don't need to know that it doesn't have a hole in it.

109
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,080
That level of resolution is enough to accomplish my goal.

110
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,680
Hence, it is correct enough.

111
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,000
In general, Newtonian physics works in everyday situations because it's correct enough.

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,600
General relativity is more correct, but it's also significantly more detailed.

113
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Check this out.

114
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,120
This was used in one of my psychology classes back in university.

115
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,560
Yes, I know that Jordan Peterson also uses it in one of his lectures.

116
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,760
I didn't actually take his lectures back in the day.

117
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,800
I think this is just a common psych thing.

118
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,840
Depending on what level of resolution you focus on, you can divide this image up into

119
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,080
multiple groupings, and each one feels intuitively correct in your own head as you do so, meaning

120
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,520
that from your perspective, the world appears to change as you change your focus.

121
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,440
And what constitutes correct depends on what level of resolution you're operating on.

122
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,040
All the way down to the makeup of the atoms that constitute this image, if it were printed

123
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,280
on a piece of paper, all the way up to recognizing the image as a single unitary thing, the image,

124
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,600
with no constituent parts, each of these views is correct enough, as long as it aligns with

125
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
your purposes.

126
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,960
And it's not just a physics thing.

127
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,680
This is how our brains operate everywhere, all the time.

128
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,320
When primitive tribal people saw an eclipse for the first time, they believed it to be

129
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,040
a mystical divine event.

130
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,960
They were absolutely incorrect, but they were correct enough for their purposes.

131
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,200
The goals of a tribal being to maintain social cohesion, something that a shared religious

132
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,880
narrative can help accomplish.

133
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,800
A pure materialist, a Marxist, let's say, will hear all of this and say that it's all

134
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,600
just chemicals in the brain, so it's not real, it's not worth anything, it's not worth consideration.

135
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,280
Whatever hypocrite that he is, he is depending on chemicals in his brain to tell them that

136
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,940
they are chemicals in the first place.

137
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:42,080
He is not actually the purely rational, disembodied spirit, caged in a prison of flesh, like he

138
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,520
claims to be, able to peer directly at the nature of the universe, if only he were more

139
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,520
free.

140
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
His intelligence is built upon the physical world.

141
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,960
His brain is a thing, after all, and it exists in a physical location where his conscious

142
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,040
experience and mental processing specifically happens.

143
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,280
And so he is also subject to these forces.

144
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,320
He can only ever be correct enough.

145
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,840
For as much as he claims to truly be objective, to truly trust the science, he can only ever

146
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,840
be correct enough.

147
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,980
Remember those Austrian innovations in economics, becoming part of mainstream thought because

148
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,320
they were, let's say, correct enough?

149
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,720
They spoke to an economic truth that wasn't simply a part of any one specific ideology,

150
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,360
but instead was so correct that it became part of the total discipline.

151
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,240
We might say that those innovations transcended their initial resolution.

152
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,140
They didn't only work here, but they also worked there and there and there.

153
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,980
The purpose of a school of thought, whether that's in economics or in physics or in psychology

154
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,300
or philosophy or anywhere else, is to put forward ideas that may not necessarily be

155
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,900
mainstream in the whole of their field, but that contribute to the tapestry of thought

156
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,040
that is the school.

157
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,140
And as Hayek said, when an idea that began in a school sees that much success, it leaves

158
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,820
the school and becomes mainstream.

159
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,620
In other words, it becomes adopted by all the other schools in the field, since evidence

160
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,940
for it is overwhelming.

161
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,380
I think that a school of thought is roughly analogous to what people on the left like

162
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,620
to call a lens.

163
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,180
Remember Destiny saying at one point, on some stream that I can't find, sorry, that

164
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,580
it's useful to understand various lenses, but not to dogmatically hold them because

165
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,980
occasionally looking at an issue through a lens might provide new insight.

166
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,740
In the same vein, it's a good idea to understand multiple schools of thought in a given field,

167
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,580
because if one school of thought can't really tackle a problem, maybe an insight from another

168
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,580
school can help you out.

169
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,580
Here's a great example.

170
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,540
I'm not a progressive or an intersectionalist, but the intersectionalist lens can be useful

171
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,620
at times to view things from a different perspective and gain new information, even if you would

172
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,220
not agree with the prescriptions of that school of thought.

173
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,660
For example, every leftoid screeching about how America is institutionally racist, that

174
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,420
the laws are anti-black, the cops are anti-black, the culture is anti-black, they just seem

175
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,660
to be incorrect.

176
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,860
That doesn't mean that those things didn't once exist, and there hasn't been some snowballing

177
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,260
effects.

178
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,060
Intergenerational wealth is an important part of climbing from working class to middle class,

179
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,380
and if past racism has broken the black family, then that intergenerational wealth doesn't

180
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,460
exist for them.

181
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,980
Even if nobody alive now actually committed any of those acts, and the legitimate racism

182
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,080
has been removed from the legal system, that doesn't mean that black people don't still

183
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,060
face some kind of uphill battle.

184
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,420
In the same vein, I'm not an ANCAP, but I find Hopp's conception of time preference

185
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,620
and his theory of property in a post-scarcity society to be two useful tools to help analyze

186
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,620
other ideas.

187
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,260
For example, one of Hopp's contentions with communism is that there can never truly be

188
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:23,260
a stateless, moneyless, classless, post-scarcity society, because even if every good and service

189
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:28,860
are infinite and provided freely, there are still some scarce resources, namely your body,

190
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,840
your time, and downstream from those two, your attention.

191
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,460
You would still need to hold exclusive ownership and domain over those things, and you would

192
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,180
still need to negotiate trade with others who want those things from you.

193
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,680
That requires a conception of property that is not communal in nature, but individualistic,

194
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,260
and everything else that is capitalist flows downstream from that position.

195
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,480
The problem is when you become ideologically attached to one school, one lens, that you

196
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,540
dogmatically filter everything through it without even thinking, and you mindlessly

197
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,000
accept the answer that it spits out without checking whether or not it maps onto reality.

198
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,600
Socialists do this, ANCAPs do this, intersectionalists and progressives do this, religious conservatives

199
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
do this.

200
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,620
They all have a rigid set of ideas, books or rules or laws or views that they feed every

201
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,560
possible stimuli into.

202
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,000
How does this relate to the bourgeoisie's class war against the proletariat?

203
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,760
How did state regulation cause this market failure?

204
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,540
How is it a product of a patriarchal society and the privileged power dynamic?

205
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,940
What does Jesus and the Bible have to say about it?

206
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:31,480
All of these can be useful questions to ask that might provide some insight, but for none

207
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,000
of them is it appropriate to ask them and only ask them, nothing else, every single

208
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
time.

209
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,360
The proper use for a school of thought isn't to follow it constantly, even when it's obviously

210
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
wrong.

211
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,720
The proper use of a lens isn't to keep it hooked up to your eye 24-7.

212
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,680
If you do, that's why you can't understand what's going on around you, you're restricting

213
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,680
your vision.

214
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,520
It's not to understand how these structures work, but to be open to new ideas, it's to

215
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,220
keep them in your back pocket as a potential mode of analysis that might occasionally yield

216
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,280
a good result.

217
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,600
Because you're not a disembodied being looking for the truth, you are not nearly smart enough

218
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,920
for that, none of us are.

219
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,480
You are looking to solve a problem, whatever the problem is, and if a new way of looking

220
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,200
at the problem might help solve it, why wouldn't you do so?

221
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,880
You don't need to follow that way dogmatically, you're not swearing an oath to it, you're

222
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
solving a problem.

223
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,000
That was the point of that Helen Lewis Jordan Peterson clip that I used, the one that got

224
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,080
me copyright struck.

225
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,680
Lewis said that she found Peterson confusing because he didn't seem to have an ideology

226
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,960
that he operated from, and Peterson correctly told her that you don't need one, and in fact,

227
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,800
having one basically destroyed her ability to independently think.

228
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,320
He was right, that's how he predicted her responses before she gave them, by simply

229
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,800
adopting her lens.

230
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,440
That's the correct position by the way, don't be ideological, or at least be as non-ideological

231
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
as you can.

232
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,080
But as I said at the beginning, if you're not ideological, you are stupidly called a

233
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,680
racist, fascist, bigot, nazi, whatever nowadays with a terminally online radical activists.

234
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,960
They expect an ideology, like Lewis did, they expect you to dance the dance, to perform

235
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,180
for them, and to observe their performances.

236
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,100
Doing so socially signals that you have the correct thoughts, that you're on the right

237
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
side of history.

238
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,400
And if you don't, then you're the enemy, because everything is political.

239
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,320
So if you disengage from anything, then you are opposing their politics.

240
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,080
You are the wrench thrown into their next five year plan.

241
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,760
So I'll leave you with the same moral lesson as the last video, since you probably didn't

242
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,760
get to hear it.

243
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,960
Only make a show of caring about something, if you actually care about it.

244
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,280
You have no obligation to care about everything, or anything, regardless of what they say.

245
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,000
And if you do want to resist them, then you have an obligation to be stubborn and obstinate

246
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,120
in your not caring.

247
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,880
The house of cards that they sit atop collapses every time you just say no, so say it loud

248
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,720
and say it proud.
