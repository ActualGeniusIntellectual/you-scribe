00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
Gab's Dissenter service came out recently, and I've been making a point to try and

00:04.560 --> 00:07.480
use it regularly because it is absolutely phenomenal.

00:07.480 --> 00:08.920
Here's how it works.

00:08.920 --> 00:12.880
Do you sometimes go to leave a comment on a video or an article, only to find that the

00:12.880 --> 00:14.240
comment section is disabled?

00:14.240 --> 00:15.900
Well, worry no more.

00:15.900 --> 00:21.120
Just head over to www.dissenter.com, type in whatever article you want to comment on,

00:21.120 --> 00:23.320
and boom, you've got a comment section.

00:23.320 --> 00:26.720
You can do this with any URL you like, like say, my YouTube channel.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.760
I've got comments open, of course.

00:28.760 --> 00:35.240
But Dissenter organizes every post by URL—hey, what the—fuck you, butters!

00:35.240 --> 00:37.160
I didn't expect anything to be here.

00:37.160 --> 00:40.960
Anyway, that's how you use Dissenter, if you're excessively anal about it.

00:40.960 --> 00:45.000
Alternatively, if you're a regular human being, you pick up the Dissenter app, click

00:45.000 --> 00:49.060
on the Dissenter button in your browser when you're on a webpage, and the Dissenter comments

00:49.060 --> 00:51.980
section for that page will load up in a side window.

00:51.980 --> 00:55.360
This is, by far, the easier way to use the service.

00:55.360 --> 00:58.580
But either way you use Dissenter, it is revolutionary.

00:58.580 --> 01:03.260
For years, people online have been complaining about the increasing centralization of power

01:03.260 --> 01:05.300
into the hands of Silicon Valley.

01:05.300 --> 01:09.660
Communities no longer have specialized forums, they just have subreddits or Facebook pages.

01:09.660 --> 01:14.400
A significant amount of public discourse—and to society's detriment, journalism—happens

01:14.400 --> 01:15.580
on Twitter.

01:15.580 --> 01:19.720
YouTube and Twitch have been more heavy-handed in auto-moderating comments and streamchats

01:19.720 --> 01:24.880
as time passes, with both demonetizations and expulsions becoming more and more common

01:24.880 --> 01:26.740
for even the slightest infraction.

01:26.740 --> 01:31.540
To the point that YouTube is now demonetizing videos if the comments posted on those videos

01:31.540 --> 01:33.500
are not family-friendly.

01:33.500 --> 01:37.020
Media outlets have begun removing comment sections on their articles, as more and more

01:37.020 --> 01:41.980
people become wise to their attempts to push narratives and ideologies into the mainstream.

01:41.980 --> 01:47.340
The internet is not the chaotic, frenzied, lively, amazing place it was ten or fifteen

01:47.340 --> 01:48.340
years ago.

01:48.340 --> 01:50.940
But Dissenter brings that all back, at least partially.

01:50.940 --> 01:55.940
Oh, Apple insiders no longer allowing comments on this Global Feminist Day article.

01:55.940 --> 01:58.220
No discourse allowed on leftist articles?

01:58.220 --> 02:01.420
Thank you, Dissenter, for proving my exact point right out the gate.

02:01.420 --> 02:03.540
Comments off on the related video, Apple.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.540
Not anymore.

02:04.540 --> 02:06.220
Haha, block this, Apple.

02:06.220 --> 02:08.220
Torba is a national treasure.

02:08.220 --> 02:11.340
Amazon isn't allowing any more reviews of the QAnon book?

02:11.340 --> 02:12.840
Review it using Dissenter.

02:12.840 --> 02:13.840
Amazon can't stop you.

02:13.840 --> 02:16.300
And as it turns out, people are doing just that.

02:16.300 --> 02:18.600
Here's Vice's take on the whole situation.

02:18.600 --> 02:22.980
Users of far-right social network Gab can now comment on the entire internet.

02:22.980 --> 02:25.300
Oh no, we can't control the narrative anymore!

02:25.300 --> 02:27.700
Quick, get the hit pieces out as fast as we can!

02:27.700 --> 02:29.380
Make sure nobody chooses freedom!

02:29.380 --> 02:33.980
Gab, the social network of the far right, has extended its free speech platform with

02:33.980 --> 02:39.060
a tool that allows users to bypass rampant corporate censorship and comment on almost

02:39.060 --> 02:41.140
anything the company said Tuesday.

02:41.140 --> 02:46.380
Called Dissenter, the new service lets users comment on news articles, YouTube videos,

02:46.380 --> 02:51.260
and even individual social media posts, even if those sites don't have comment sections

02:51.260 --> 02:52.920
or have comments switched off.

02:52.920 --> 02:57.240
For example, movie review website Rotten Tomatoes announced that it was switching off

02:57.240 --> 03:01.560
comments on the new Captain Marvel movie this week over concerns that trolls plan to

03:01.560 --> 03:05.560
leave negative comments following remarks by the film's star.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.040
And thank god, Rotten Tomatoes has really been circling the bowl recently.

03:09.040 --> 03:12.120
I remember actually trusting it for unbiased opinions once.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.960
At least Dissenter allows us to solve the problem the way that we've solved most other

03:15.960 --> 03:16.960
problems.

03:16.960 --> 03:17.960
Outsource it to the marketplace!

03:17.960 --> 03:22.840
Another popular use is to comment on YouTube videos where comments have been disabled.

03:22.840 --> 03:27.680
YouTube last week purged the site of tens of millions of comments after it was revealed

03:27.680 --> 03:31.720
that they were being used to direct users to potentially sexual videos of children.

03:31.720 --> 03:35.820
The way this is written, the implication here is that Gab wouldn't delete comments that

03:35.820 --> 03:40.800
also somehow involved linking to sexual videos of children, but Gab's policy has always

03:40.800 --> 03:45.840
been to uphold the law of the United States and go not one step farther in so far as free

03:45.840 --> 03:47.000
speech is concerned.

03:47.040 --> 03:51.520
Radical ideologues like the ones at Vice would have you believe there's no middle ground

03:51.520 --> 03:57.560
between complete unfettered free speech including all slanderous inciting illegal pedophilic

03:57.560 --> 04:02.480
content and overarching totalitarian control of speech and thought with Silicon Valley's

04:02.480 --> 04:06.080
trust and safety team directly jacked into our brains at all times.

04:06.080 --> 04:09.600
Oh what's this David, no comment section on your shitty article?

04:09.600 --> 04:11.160
Ah ha, too bad!

04:11.160 --> 04:12.600
This is what Vice hates.

04:12.600 --> 04:16.600
The fact that with a simple click of the mouse the narrative is now out of their control.

04:16.600 --> 04:22.080
And nobody is surprised that Vice supporting SJWs on Twitter see this as problematic.

04:22.080 --> 04:27.160
So the alt-right platform Gab has produced an app called Dissenter that lets neo-Nazi

04:27.160 --> 04:31.360
shitstains and MRAs comment on closed webpages and social media.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.000
I'm not any of those though.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.800
Well you are if you use Dissenter.

04:34.800 --> 04:38.360
You'll be getting your Nazi membership card in the mail shortly.

04:38.360 --> 04:42.280
Tommy Robinson fans find a new way to get around Facebook and Twitter bans.

04:42.280 --> 04:47.160
I know that Tommy's panorama situation has made the UK's media institutions massively

04:47.160 --> 04:51.880
butthurt but Dissenter isn't just for Tommy Robinson fans, it's for everyone.

04:51.880 --> 04:55.800
This one actually reads more Orwellian than the Vice article, like listen to this.

04:55.800 --> 04:59.880
In the BBC's article announcing Robinson's latest social media ban, the comment section

04:59.880 --> 05:04.820
has been disabled but in its place there is a flowing conversation on Dissenter.

05:04.820 --> 05:09.600
One Gab user, Crusader Keith, proclaimed his joy at being able to say what he likes in

05:09.600 --> 05:11.040
a BBC article.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.600
That is the problem these tyrants have in the end.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.960
Somebody is able to say what they like.

05:15.960 --> 05:16.960
Somebody is happy.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.520
Gab wants to add a comment section to everything on the internet.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.800
I remember the early days of the internet when implementing a comment section was a

05:22.800 --> 05:24.800
big deal for a growing website.

05:24.800 --> 05:28.620
But now the true sign of growth is removing features, not adding them.

05:28.620 --> 05:29.960
What a strange world we live in.

05:29.960 --> 05:33.880
Dissenter comes at a time when platforms are struggling with how to manage what gets posted

05:33.880 --> 05:35.000
on their services.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.440
Which is why it's so important.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.540
Freedom is the solution, not the problem.

05:39.540 --> 05:44.100
In February, YouTube disabled comments for tens of millions of videos and also booted

05:44.100 --> 05:46.980
more than 400 channels for the comments that had been left.

05:46.980 --> 05:50.340
Imagine saying this in your article as if it's a good thing, that people lost their

05:50.340 --> 05:54.360
YouTube channels because of the comments posted on those channels by other people.

05:54.360 --> 05:58.380
That means that this person, the author of this article, Aaron Carson, thinks it's acceptable

05:58.380 --> 06:03.740
for me to go on an innocent channel with false troll accounts and spam it with YouTube disapproved

06:03.740 --> 06:07.420
rhetoric until YouTube decides to ban that channel for my actions.

06:07.420 --> 06:10.300
Nobody with a brain can think this is a good idea.

06:10.300 --> 06:15.140
Gab browser extension puts a far right comment section on every site, and how dare they do

06:15.140 --> 06:16.140
so.

06:16.140 --> 06:21.760
The Dissenter plugin, even just dissenting now warrants scare quotes, allows Gab users

06:21.760 --> 06:27.020
to discuss everything from tweets to Wikipedia pages in real time, without the fear of said

06:27.020 --> 06:29.660
comment being removed by the site's moderators.

06:29.660 --> 06:33.580
You know, I really think this is the online version of the overbearing helicopter parent

06:33.580 --> 06:37.540
who wants to prevent their children from having any secrets, getting into any trouble,

06:37.540 --> 06:41.820
or enjoying any fun until they're fucking 35, all the while forgetting what it was like

06:41.820 --> 06:42.820
to be young themselves.

06:42.820 --> 06:46.620
Now that they've lived through their own childhoods as free spirits, it's time for

06:46.620 --> 06:50.220
the entirety of human existence to be tightly controlled and regulated.

06:50.220 --> 06:51.820
It's hardly a unique idea.

06:51.820 --> 06:56.900
Pre-Reddit social aggregator dig launched a comments tool in 2015 to encourage conversations

06:56.900 --> 07:00.860
on newslinks, but Dissenter is clearly tailor-made for the Gab crowd.

07:00.860 --> 07:03.620
And that reminds me, wasn't Dissenter made before?

07:03.620 --> 07:04.620
Oh yeah.

07:04.620 --> 07:09.100
I remember a web app like Dissenter 15 years ago, and it dried up because who gives a fuck

07:09.100 --> 07:11.540
what a bunch of random trolls online think.

07:11.540 --> 07:13.100
It was built by Google.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.100
It didn't dry up.

07:14.100 --> 07:18.380
They shut it down because the media, publishers, and advertisers lost their minds and pressured

07:18.380 --> 07:19.380
them to.

07:19.380 --> 07:20.380
We won't.

07:20.380 --> 07:21.380
Trolls surface truth.

07:21.380 --> 07:25.940
Truth is found in the comments section, always, which is why publishers shut them all down.

07:25.940 --> 07:27.420
And here's the core of the matter.

07:27.420 --> 07:30.840
Dissenter is something that people all across the internet, with the exception of the isolated

07:30.840 --> 07:35.040
bubble that is the radical left, have been clamoring for for years now.

07:35.040 --> 07:38.160
Of course, we should remember that censorship isn't a left-right issue.

07:38.160 --> 07:41.720
Today's censors are on the left, sure, but the right has been the great censor in the

07:41.720 --> 07:43.960
past, and they probably will be again in the future.

07:43.960 --> 07:48.920
The common view of the censor, at least when I was young, was either a fascist or religious

07:48.920 --> 07:52.220
fanatic, both figures commonly associated with the radical right.

07:52.220 --> 07:56.760
But nowadays, it's the genderless, plaid-wearing, dyed-hair, hipster tech journal.

07:56.760 --> 08:01.840
But regardless of their differences in politics, they all arbitrarily find some speech offensive

08:01.840 --> 08:06.720
to their sensibilities, they all desire social control, and so they all censor.

08:06.720 --> 08:11.200
If you hold an opinion, there's somebody, somewhere, who wants you to shut up.

08:11.200 --> 08:15.120
And in regards to public discourse, progressives have created a list of prohibited words and

08:15.120 --> 08:20.420
ideas, continually expanding it to include more and more speech as more and more people

08:20.420 --> 08:23.040
voice their own individual special complaints.

08:23.040 --> 08:26.640
With the common fear that, eventually, no speech at all will ever be allowed.

08:26.640 --> 08:31.200
The real solution, though, is to not cave to any complaints in the first place.

08:31.200 --> 08:35.600
As the ability for people to voice themselves dwindles, an ability that was and remains

08:35.600 --> 08:40.400
the foundation of the entire internet, Dissenter re-enpowers the people in a monumental way.

08:40.400 --> 08:46.280
In the current digitized world, trivial information is accumulating every second, preserved in

08:46.280 --> 08:50.760
all its triteness, never fading, always accessible.

08:50.760 --> 08:55.600
Rumors about petty issues, misinterpretations, slander.

08:55.600 --> 09:01.960
All this junk data, preserved in an unfiltered state, growing at an alarming rate.

09:01.960 --> 09:05.920
It will only slow down social progress, reduce the rate of evolution.

09:05.920 --> 09:06.920
Right.

09:06.920 --> 09:10.120
You seem to think that our plan is one of censorship.

09:10.120 --> 09:12.000
Are you telling me it's not?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
You're being silly.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.680
What we propose to do is not to control content, but to create context.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.000
In an age of curated content, where large companies dictate to their users that they

09:22.000 --> 09:27.200
will enjoy safe, plastic wrapped, mindless, non-controversial media, Dissenter allows

09:27.200 --> 09:29.080
people to debate and discuss again.

09:29.080 --> 09:33.240
It allows things to actually trend instead of old media purchasing front page spots.

09:33.240 --> 09:37.760
And it allows complaints to be freely aired without them being labeled as problematic.

09:37.760 --> 09:42.180
YouTube and Facebook are going the way of Las Vegas, where what happened in Vegas stays

09:42.180 --> 09:47.420
in Vegas was a saying that once actually referred to wild cocaine gangbangs, but is now only

09:47.420 --> 09:52.100
uttered by obese moms in their fifties, sipping on fruity drinks, losing a couple hundred

09:52.100 --> 09:54.780
bucks at the casino and turning in at 8 30 PM.

09:54.780 --> 09:58.340
But the rough edges of the internet can't be rounded off the same way that Vegas is

09:58.340 --> 09:59.900
or Times Squares have been.

09:59.900 --> 10:03.460
I mentioned at the beginning of the video that smaller communities used to run their

10:03.460 --> 10:04.740
own tiny forms.

10:04.740 --> 10:08.020
The internet was once an endless frontier where everybody could carve out their own

10:08.020 --> 10:09.820
little homestead in the wild.

10:09.820 --> 10:13.940
But now a lot of these communities simply rely on Reddit subs or Facebook pages due

10:13.940 --> 10:15.060
to the ease of it.

10:15.060 --> 10:16.420
And for a lot of them, that's fine.

10:16.420 --> 10:21.020
But as that list of prohibited words and ideas expands ever outward, more and more

10:21.020 --> 10:23.400
people will be banned from these huge platforms.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.920
Back in the day, if you were banned from a form, fine, whatever.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.300
You move on to the next community.

10:27.300 --> 10:31.060
But now when you're banned, you've been completely cut off from public discourse.

10:31.060 --> 10:34.540
There is no going to the next one when there is only one.

10:34.540 --> 10:37.980
Do that enough and people start to group together on the fringes of the internet.

10:37.980 --> 10:42.260
When Gab popped up, both Silicon Valley and the left-leaning media realized that the internet

10:42.260 --> 10:46.580
wasn't like Yu-Gi-Oh!, where banning somebody to the shadow realm wasn't just a clever

10:46.580 --> 10:54.940
euphemism for killing someone.

10:54.940 --> 10:57.540
When you ban somebody, they don't just vanish.

10:57.540 --> 11:01.260
When you erect walls, the world beyond them continues to exist.

11:01.260 --> 11:06.020
These tech giants centralized so much power that those who were banned had no alternative

11:06.020 --> 11:07.100
but to innovate.

11:07.100 --> 11:11.460
To center is the graffiti on the walls that big tech erected around their consolidated

11:11.460 --> 11:12.460
internet.

11:12.460 --> 11:16.860
Decentre has done something that, so far, Gab has unfortunately failed to do, and that's

11:16.860 --> 11:17.860
go mainstream.

11:17.860 --> 11:23.000
Gab's official Twitter account claims that 43% of Decentre users have commented using

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
the service.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.400
In comparison, most platforms see an 8-9% usage rate, with 90% of people simply passively

11:29.400 --> 11:30.980
consuming whatever's in front of them.

11:30.980 --> 11:34.720
Some of this can be chalked up to Decentre being new, sure, but I do think a good chunk

11:34.720 --> 11:37.580
of it is a genuine desire for people to have a voice again.

11:37.580 --> 11:40.420
Honestly, the most fun I've had with Decentre is outside of the culture war.

11:40.420 --> 11:44.260
I'll load it up on something completely apolitical and sometimes even ancient, like

11:44.260 --> 11:50.380
a Wii U soft mod guide, or an old is it a good idea to microwave this video from 2007,

11:50.380 --> 11:54.680
or instructions on how to cook the perfect stir fry, and I'll just leave a random message.

11:54.680 --> 11:58.540
Something innocuous, something that somebody might not even see for another five years

11:58.540 --> 11:59.540
or something.

11:59.540 --> 12:00.780
It's like leaving behind a time capsule.

12:00.780 --> 12:02.720
I hope Decentre continues to succeed.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.700
It absolutely is a work in progress.

12:04.700 --> 12:08.020
They've announced that they're creating their own trending pages for every single

12:08.020 --> 12:09.020
domain.

12:09.020 --> 12:14.020
Rather than dealing with, for example, YouTube's curated crap on the recommended page, we can

12:14.020 --> 12:17.100
just see Decentre's neutral trending on YouTube selection.

12:17.100 --> 12:21.040
In my opinion, I could also use a follow or friends feature so that you can see what people

12:21.040 --> 12:22.820
you want to follow are commenting on.

12:22.820 --> 12:26.300
But long term, I think Decentre's going to change the internet in a huge way, far

12:26.300 --> 12:29.700
more than Gab ever could as a simple social media platform.

12:29.700 --> 12:32.800
When I set up a new PC, there's a few things I do right off.

12:32.800 --> 12:37.580
Replace Internet Explorer, get Discord and Skype, install basic useful apps like ImageBurn

12:37.580 --> 12:40.240
and Recuva and Hardware Monitor and Steam.

12:40.240 --> 12:42.900
I think the Decentre plugin is going on that list.

12:42.900 --> 12:44.780
With it, the internet feels like home again.

12:44.780 --> 12:48.520
It feels like I can voice my opinion and not have to worry about being blacklisted from

12:48.520 --> 12:51.740
five different social media companies Alex Jones style.

12:51.740 --> 12:55.900
Push comes to shove, I would rather be offended than be censored.

13:21.740 --> 13:25.020
Long enough you're likely to come to believe it.

13:25.020 --> 13:31.700
I spoke to somebody who said that when she watched her 15th Alex Jones Info Wars video,

13:31.700 --> 13:36.540
he said something that made sense to her and it freaked her out because she had been trying

13:36.540 --> 13:40.020
to keep her wits about her and trying to make sure that she didn't get taken down a rabbit

13:40.020 --> 13:43.900
hole and all of a sudden she herself was starting to believe in these views.

13:43.900 --> 13:48.820
So it seems like it's a really underexplored aspect of being a content moderator.

13:48.820 --> 13:53.100
And of course the scary thing is you might only do this job for eight months, ten months,

13:53.100 --> 13:56.260
but then you know these new beliefs that you have can last for a lot longer.
