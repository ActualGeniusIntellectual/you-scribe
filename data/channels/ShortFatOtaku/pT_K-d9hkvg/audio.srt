00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Gab's Dissenter service came out recently, and I've been making a point to try and

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,480
use it regularly because it is absolutely phenomenal.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,920
Here's how it works.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,880
Do you sometimes go to leave a comment on a video or an article, only to find that the

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,240
comment section is disabled?

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,900
Well, worry no more.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,120
Just head over to www.dissenter.com, type in whatever article you want to comment on,

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,320
and boom, you've got a comment section.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,720
You can do this with any URL you like, like say, my YouTube channel.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,760
I've got comments open, of course.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:35,240
But Dissenter organizes every post by URL—hey, what the—fuck you, butters!

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,160
I didn't expect anything to be here.

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,960
Anyway, that's how you use Dissenter, if you're excessively anal about it.

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,000
Alternatively, if you're a regular human being, you pick up the Dissenter app, click

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,060
on the Dissenter button in your browser when you're on a webpage, and the Dissenter comments

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,980
section for that page will load up in a side window.

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,360
This is, by far, the easier way to use the service.

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,580
But either way you use Dissenter, it is revolutionary.

19
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,260
For years, people online have been complaining about the increasing centralization of power

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,300
into the hands of Silicon Valley.

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,660
Communities no longer have specialized forums, they just have subreddits or Facebook pages.

22
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,400
A significant amount of public discourse—and to society's detriment, journalism—happens

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,580
on Twitter.

24
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,720
YouTube and Twitch have been more heavy-handed in auto-moderating comments and streamchats

25
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,880
as time passes, with both demonetizations and expulsions becoming more and more common

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,740
for even the slightest infraction.

27
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,540
To the point that YouTube is now demonetizing videos if the comments posted on those videos

28
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,500
are not family-friendly.

29
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,020
Media outlets have begun removing comment sections on their articles, as more and more

30
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,980
people become wise to their attempts to push narratives and ideologies into the mainstream.

31
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:47,340
The internet is not the chaotic, frenzied, lively, amazing place it was ten or fifteen

32
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,340
years ago.

33
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,940
But Dissenter brings that all back, at least partially.

34
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,940
Oh, Apple insiders no longer allowing comments on this Global Feminist Day article.

35
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,220
No discourse allowed on leftist articles?

36
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,420
Thank you, Dissenter, for proving my exact point right out the gate.

37
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,540
Comments off on the related video, Apple.

38
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,540
Not anymore.

39
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,220
Haha, block this, Apple.

40
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,220
Torba is a national treasure.

41
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,340
Amazon isn't allowing any more reviews of the QAnon book?

42
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,840
Review it using Dissenter.

43
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Amazon can't stop you.

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,300
And as it turns out, people are doing just that.

45
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,600
Here's Vice's take on the whole situation.

46
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,980
Users of far-right social network Gab can now comment on the entire internet.

47
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,300
Oh no, we can't control the narrative anymore!

48
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,700
Quick, get the hit pieces out as fast as we can!

49
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,380
Make sure nobody chooses freedom!

50
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,980
Gab, the social network of the far right, has extended its free speech platform with

51
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:39,060
a tool that allows users to bypass rampant corporate censorship and comment on almost

52
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,140
anything the company said Tuesday.

53
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,380
Called Dissenter, the new service lets users comment on news articles, YouTube videos,

54
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,260
and even individual social media posts, even if those sites don't have comment sections

55
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,920
or have comments switched off.

56
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,240
For example, movie review website Rotten Tomatoes announced that it was switching off

57
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,560
comments on the new Captain Marvel movie this week over concerns that trolls plan to

58
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,560
leave negative comments following remarks by the film's star.

59
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,040
And thank god, Rotten Tomatoes has really been circling the bowl recently.

60
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,120
I remember actually trusting it for unbiased opinions once.

61
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,960
At least Dissenter allows us to solve the problem the way that we've solved most other

62
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
problems.

63
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
Outsource it to the marketplace!

64
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,840
Another popular use is to comment on YouTube videos where comments have been disabled.

65
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,680
YouTube last week purged the site of tens of millions of comments after it was revealed

66
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,720
that they were being used to direct users to potentially sexual videos of children.

67
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,820
The way this is written, the implication here is that Gab wouldn't delete comments that

68
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,800
also somehow involved linking to sexual videos of children, but Gab's policy has always

69
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,840
been to uphold the law of the United States and go not one step farther in so far as free

70
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,000
speech is concerned.

71
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,520
Radical ideologues like the ones at Vice would have you believe there's no middle ground

72
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:57,560
between complete unfettered free speech including all slanderous inciting illegal pedophilic

73
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,480
content and overarching totalitarian control of speech and thought with Silicon Valley's

74
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,080
trust and safety team directly jacked into our brains at all times.

75
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,600
Oh what's this David, no comment section on your shitty article?

76
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,160
Ah ha, too bad!

77
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,600
This is what Vice hates.

78
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
The fact that with a simple click of the mouse the narrative is now out of their control.

79
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,080
And nobody is surprised that Vice supporting SJWs on Twitter see this as problematic.

80
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,160
So the alt-right platform Gab has produced an app called Dissenter that lets neo-Nazi

81
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,360
shitstains and MRAs comment on closed webpages and social media.

82
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm not any of those though.

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,800
Well you are if you use Dissenter.

84
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,360
You'll be getting your Nazi membership card in the mail shortly.

85
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,280
Tommy Robinson fans find a new way to get around Facebook and Twitter bans.

86
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,160
I know that Tommy's panorama situation has made the UK's media institutions massively

87
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,880
butthurt but Dissenter isn't just for Tommy Robinson fans, it's for everyone.

88
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,800
This one actually reads more Orwellian than the Vice article, like listen to this.

89
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,880
In the BBC's article announcing Robinson's latest social media ban, the comment section

90
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,820
has been disabled but in its place there is a flowing conversation on Dissenter.

91
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,600
One Gab user, Crusader Keith, proclaimed his joy at being able to say what he likes in

92
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,040
a BBC article.

93
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,600
That is the problem these tyrants have in the end.

94
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,960
Somebody is able to say what they like.

95
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Somebody is happy.

96
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,520
Gab wants to add a comment section to everything on the internet.

97
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,800
I remember the early days of the internet when implementing a comment section was a

98
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
big deal for a growing website.

99
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,620
But now the true sign of growth is removing features, not adding them.

100
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,960
What a strange world we live in.

101
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,880
Dissenter comes at a time when platforms are struggling with how to manage what gets posted

102
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,000
on their services.

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,440
Which is why it's so important.

104
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,540
Freedom is the solution, not the problem.

105
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,100
In February, YouTube disabled comments for tens of millions of videos and also booted

106
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,980
more than 400 channels for the comments that had been left.

107
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,340
Imagine saying this in your article as if it's a good thing, that people lost their

108
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,360
YouTube channels because of the comments posted on those channels by other people.

109
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,380
That means that this person, the author of this article, Aaron Carson, thinks it's acceptable

110
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,740
for me to go on an innocent channel with false troll accounts and spam it with YouTube disapproved

111
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,420
rhetoric until YouTube decides to ban that channel for my actions.

112
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,300
Nobody with a brain can think this is a good idea.

113
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,140
Gab browser extension puts a far right comment section on every site, and how dare they do

114
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,140
so.

115
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,760
The Dissenter plugin, even just dissenting now warrants scare quotes, allows Gab users

116
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,020
to discuss everything from tweets to Wikipedia pages in real time, without the fear of said

117
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,660
comment being removed by the site's moderators.

118
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,580
You know, I really think this is the online version of the overbearing helicopter parent

119
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,540
who wants to prevent their children from having any secrets, getting into any trouble,

120
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,820
or enjoying any fun until they're fucking 35, all the while forgetting what it was like

121
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,820
to be young themselves.

122
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,620
Now that they've lived through their own childhoods as free spirits, it's time for

123
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,220
the entirety of human existence to be tightly controlled and regulated.

124
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,820
It's hardly a unique idea.

125
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,900
Pre-Reddit social aggregator dig launched a comments tool in 2015 to encourage conversations

126
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,860
on newslinks, but Dissenter is clearly tailor-made for the Gab crowd.

127
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,620
And that reminds me, wasn't Dissenter made before?

128
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,620
Oh yeah.

129
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,100
I remember a web app like Dissenter 15 years ago, and it dried up because who gives a fuck

130
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,540
what a bunch of random trolls online think.

131
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,100
It was built by Google.

132
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,100
It didn't dry up.

133
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,380
They shut it down because the media, publishers, and advertisers lost their minds and pressured

134
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,380
them to.

135
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,380
We won't.

136
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,380
Trolls surface truth.

137
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,940
Truth is found in the comments section, always, which is why publishers shut them all down.

138
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,420
And here's the core of the matter.

139
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,840
Dissenter is something that people all across the internet, with the exception of the isolated

140
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,040
bubble that is the radical left, have been clamoring for for years now.

141
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,160
Of course, we should remember that censorship isn't a left-right issue.

142
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,720
Today's censors are on the left, sure, but the right has been the great censor in the

143
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,960
past, and they probably will be again in the future.

144
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,920
The common view of the censor, at least when I was young, was either a fascist or religious

145
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,220
fanatic, both figures commonly associated with the radical right.

146
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,760
But nowadays, it's the genderless, plaid-wearing, dyed-hair, hipster tech journal.

147
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,840
But regardless of their differences in politics, they all arbitrarily find some speech offensive

148
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,720
to their sensibilities, they all desire social control, and so they all censor.

149
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,200
If you hold an opinion, there's somebody, somewhere, who wants you to shut up.

150
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,120
And in regards to public discourse, progressives have created a list of prohibited words and

151
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,420
ideas, continually expanding it to include more and more speech as more and more people

152
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,040
voice their own individual special complaints.

153
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,640
With the common fear that, eventually, no speech at all will ever be allowed.

154
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,200
The real solution, though, is to not cave to any complaints in the first place.

155
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,600
As the ability for people to voice themselves dwindles, an ability that was and remains

156
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,400
the foundation of the entire internet, Dissenter re-enpowers the people in a monumental way.

157
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:46,280
In the current digitized world, trivial information is accumulating every second, preserved in

158
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,760
all its triteness, never fading, always accessible.

159
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,600
Rumors about petty issues, misinterpretations, slander.

160
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,960
All this junk data, preserved in an unfiltered state, growing at an alarming rate.

161
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,920
It will only slow down social progress, reduce the rate of evolution.

162
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Right.

163
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,120
You seem to think that our plan is one of censorship.

164
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,000
Are you telling me it's not?

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You're being silly.

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,680
What we propose to do is not to control content, but to create context.

167
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,000
In an age of curated content, where large companies dictate to their users that they

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,200
will enjoy safe, plastic wrapped, mindless, non-controversial media, Dissenter allows

169
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,080
people to debate and discuss again.

170
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,240
It allows things to actually trend instead of old media purchasing front page spots.

171
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,760
And it allows complaints to be freely aired without them being labeled as problematic.

172
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,180
YouTube and Facebook are going the way of Las Vegas, where what happened in Vegas stays

173
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,420
in Vegas was a saying that once actually referred to wild cocaine gangbangs, but is now only

174
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,100
uttered by obese moms in their fifties, sipping on fruity drinks, losing a couple hundred

175
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,780
bucks at the casino and turning in at 8 30 PM.

176
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,340
But the rough edges of the internet can't be rounded off the same way that Vegas is

177
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,900
or Times Squares have been.

178
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,460
I mentioned at the beginning of the video that smaller communities used to run their

179
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,740
own tiny forms.

180
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,020
The internet was once an endless frontier where everybody could carve out their own

181
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,820
little homestead in the wild.

182
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,940
But now a lot of these communities simply rely on Reddit subs or Facebook pages due

183
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,060
to the ease of it.

184
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,420
And for a lot of them, that's fine.

185
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:21,020
But as that list of prohibited words and ideas expands ever outward, more and more

186
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,400
people will be banned from these huge platforms.

187
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,920
Back in the day, if you were banned from a form, fine, whatever.

188
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,300
You move on to the next community.

189
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,060
But now when you're banned, you've been completely cut off from public discourse.

190
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,540
There is no going to the next one when there is only one.

191
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,980
Do that enough and people start to group together on the fringes of the internet.

192
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,260
When Gab popped up, both Silicon Valley and the left-leaning media realized that the internet

193
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,580
wasn't like Yu-Gi-Oh!, where banning somebody to the shadow realm wasn't just a clever

194
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:54,940
euphemism for killing someone.

195
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,540
When you ban somebody, they don't just vanish.

196
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,260
When you erect walls, the world beyond them continues to exist.

197
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,020
These tech giants centralized so much power that those who were banned had no alternative

198
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,100
but to innovate.

199
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,460
To center is the graffiti on the walls that big tech erected around their consolidated

200
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,460
internet.

201
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,860
Decentre has done something that, so far, Gab has unfortunately failed to do, and that's

202
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,860
go mainstream.

203
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:23,000
Gab's official Twitter account claims that 43% of Decentre users have commented using

204
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
the service.

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,400
In comparison, most platforms see an 8-9% usage rate, with 90% of people simply passively

206
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,980
consuming whatever's in front of them.

207
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,720
Some of this can be chalked up to Decentre being new, sure, but I do think a good chunk

208
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,580
of it is a genuine desire for people to have a voice again.

209
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,420
Honestly, the most fun I've had with Decentre is outside of the culture war.

210
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,260
I'll load it up on something completely apolitical and sometimes even ancient, like

211
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:50,380
a Wii U soft mod guide, or an old is it a good idea to microwave this video from 2007,

212
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,680
or instructions on how to cook the perfect stir fry, and I'll just leave a random message.

213
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,540
Something innocuous, something that somebody might not even see for another five years

214
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,540
or something.

215
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,780
It's like leaving behind a time capsule.

216
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,720
I hope Decentre continues to succeed.

217
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,700
It absolutely is a work in progress.

218
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,020
They've announced that they're creating their own trending pages for every single

219
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,020
domain.

220
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:14,020
Rather than dealing with, for example, YouTube's curated crap on the recommended page, we can

221
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,100
just see Decentre's neutral trending on YouTube selection.

222
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,040
In my opinion, I could also use a follow or friends feature so that you can see what people

223
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,820
you want to follow are commenting on.

224
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,300
But long term, I think Decentre's going to change the internet in a huge way, far

225
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,700
more than Gab ever could as a simple social media platform.

226
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,800
When I set up a new PC, there's a few things I do right off.

227
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,580
Replace Internet Explorer, get Discord and Skype, install basic useful apps like ImageBurn

228
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,240
and Recuva and Hardware Monitor and Steam.

229
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,900
I think the Decentre plugin is going on that list.

230
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,780
With it, the internet feels like home again.

231
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,520
It feels like I can voice my opinion and not have to worry about being blacklisted from

232
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,740
five different social media companies Alex Jones style.

233
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,900
Push comes to shove, I would rather be offended than be censored.

234
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,020
Long enough you're likely to come to believe it.

235
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:31,700
I spoke to somebody who said that when she watched her 15th Alex Jones Info Wars video,

236
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,540
he said something that made sense to her and it freaked her out because she had been trying

237
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,020
to keep her wits about her and trying to make sure that she didn't get taken down a rabbit

238
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,900
hole and all of a sudden she herself was starting to believe in these views.

239
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,820
So it seems like it's a really underexplored aspect of being a content moderator.

240
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,100
And of course the scary thing is you might only do this job for eight months, ten months,

241
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,260
but then you know these new beliefs that you have can last for a lot longer.
