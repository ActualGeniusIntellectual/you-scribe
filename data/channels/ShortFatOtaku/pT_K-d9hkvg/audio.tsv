0	4560	Gab's Dissenter service came out recently, and I've been making a point to try and
4560	7480	use it regularly because it is absolutely phenomenal.
7480	8920	Here's how it works.
8920	12880	Do you sometimes go to leave a comment on a video or an article, only to find that the
12880	14240	comment section is disabled?
14240	15900	Well, worry no more.
15900	21120	Just head over to www.dissenter.com, type in whatever article you want to comment on,
21120	23320	and boom, you've got a comment section.
23320	26720	You can do this with any URL you like, like say, my YouTube channel.
26720	28760	I've got comments open, of course.
28760	35240	But Dissenter organizes every post by URL—hey, what the—fuck you, butters!
35240	37160	I didn't expect anything to be here.
37160	40960	Anyway, that's how you use Dissenter, if you're excessively anal about it.
40960	45000	Alternatively, if you're a regular human being, you pick up the Dissenter app, click
45000	49060	on the Dissenter button in your browser when you're on a webpage, and the Dissenter comments
49060	51980	section for that page will load up in a side window.
51980	55360	This is, by far, the easier way to use the service.
55360	58580	But either way you use Dissenter, it is revolutionary.
58580	63260	For years, people online have been complaining about the increasing centralization of power
63260	65300	into the hands of Silicon Valley.
65300	69660	Communities no longer have specialized forums, they just have subreddits or Facebook pages.
69660	74400	A significant amount of public discourse—and to society's detriment, journalism—happens
74400	75580	on Twitter.
75580	79720	YouTube and Twitch have been more heavy-handed in auto-moderating comments and streamchats
79720	84880	as time passes, with both demonetizations and expulsions becoming more and more common
84880	86740	for even the slightest infraction.
86740	91540	To the point that YouTube is now demonetizing videos if the comments posted on those videos
91540	93500	are not family-friendly.
93500	97020	Media outlets have begun removing comment sections on their articles, as more and more
97020	101980	people become wise to their attempts to push narratives and ideologies into the mainstream.
101980	107340	The internet is not the chaotic, frenzied, lively, amazing place it was ten or fifteen
107340	108340	years ago.
108340	110940	But Dissenter brings that all back, at least partially.
110940	115940	Oh, Apple insiders no longer allowing comments on this Global Feminist Day article.
115940	118220	No discourse allowed on leftist articles?
118220	121420	Thank you, Dissenter, for proving my exact point right out the gate.
121420	123540	Comments off on the related video, Apple.
123540	124540	Not anymore.
124540	126220	Haha, block this, Apple.
126220	128220	Torba is a national treasure.
128220	131340	Amazon isn't allowing any more reviews of the QAnon book?
131340	132840	Review it using Dissenter.
132840	133840	Amazon can't stop you.
133840	136300	And as it turns out, people are doing just that.
136300	138600	Here's Vice's take on the whole situation.
138600	142980	Users of far-right social network Gab can now comment on the entire internet.
142980	145300	Oh no, we can't control the narrative anymore!
145300	147700	Quick, get the hit pieces out as fast as we can!
147700	149380	Make sure nobody chooses freedom!
149380	153980	Gab, the social network of the far right, has extended its free speech platform with
153980	159060	a tool that allows users to bypass rampant corporate censorship and comment on almost
159060	161140	anything the company said Tuesday.
161140	166380	Called Dissenter, the new service lets users comment on news articles, YouTube videos,
166380	171260	and even individual social media posts, even if those sites don't have comment sections
171260	172920	or have comments switched off.
172920	177240	For example, movie review website Rotten Tomatoes announced that it was switching off
177240	181560	comments on the new Captain Marvel movie this week over concerns that trolls plan to
181560	185560	leave negative comments following remarks by the film's star.
185560	189040	And thank god, Rotten Tomatoes has really been circling the bowl recently.
189040	192120	I remember actually trusting it for unbiased opinions once.
192120	195960	At least Dissenter allows us to solve the problem the way that we've solved most other
195960	196960	problems.
196960	197960	Outsource it to the marketplace!
197960	202840	Another popular use is to comment on YouTube videos where comments have been disabled.
202840	207680	YouTube last week purged the site of tens of millions of comments after it was revealed
207680	211720	that they were being used to direct users to potentially sexual videos of children.
211720	215820	The way this is written, the implication here is that Gab wouldn't delete comments that
215820	220800	also somehow involved linking to sexual videos of children, but Gab's policy has always
220800	225840	been to uphold the law of the United States and go not one step farther in so far as free
225840	227000	speech is concerned.
227040	231520	Radical ideologues like the ones at Vice would have you believe there's no middle ground
231520	237560	between complete unfettered free speech including all slanderous inciting illegal pedophilic
237560	242480	content and overarching totalitarian control of speech and thought with Silicon Valley's
242480	246080	trust and safety team directly jacked into our brains at all times.
246080	249600	Oh what's this David, no comment section on your shitty article?
249600	251160	Ah ha, too bad!
251160	252600	This is what Vice hates.
252600	256600	The fact that with a simple click of the mouse the narrative is now out of their control.
256600	262080	And nobody is surprised that Vice supporting SJWs on Twitter see this as problematic.
262080	267160	So the alt-right platform Gab has produced an app called Dissenter that lets neo-Nazi
267160	271360	shitstains and MRAs comment on closed webpages and social media.
271360	273000	I'm not any of those though.
273000	274800	Well you are if you use Dissenter.
274800	278360	You'll be getting your Nazi membership card in the mail shortly.
278360	282280	Tommy Robinson fans find a new way to get around Facebook and Twitter bans.
282280	287160	I know that Tommy's panorama situation has made the UK's media institutions massively
287160	291880	butthurt but Dissenter isn't just for Tommy Robinson fans, it's for everyone.
291880	295800	This one actually reads more Orwellian than the Vice article, like listen to this.
295800	299880	In the BBC's article announcing Robinson's latest social media ban, the comment section
299880	304820	has been disabled but in its place there is a flowing conversation on Dissenter.
304820	309600	One Gab user, Crusader Keith, proclaimed his joy at being able to say what he likes in
309600	311040	a BBC article.
311040	313600	That is the problem these tyrants have in the end.
313600	315960	Somebody is able to say what they like.
315960	316960	Somebody is happy.
316960	319520	Gab wants to add a comment section to everything on the internet.
319520	322800	I remember the early days of the internet when implementing a comment section was a
322800	324800	big deal for a growing website.
324800	328620	But now the true sign of growth is removing features, not adding them.
328620	329960	What a strange world we live in.
329960	333880	Dissenter comes at a time when platforms are struggling with how to manage what gets posted
333880	335000	on their services.
335000	337440	Which is why it's so important.
337440	339540	Freedom is the solution, not the problem.
339540	344100	In February, YouTube disabled comments for tens of millions of videos and also booted
344100	346980	more than 400 channels for the comments that had been left.
346980	350340	Imagine saying this in your article as if it's a good thing, that people lost their
350340	354360	YouTube channels because of the comments posted on those channels by other people.
354360	358380	That means that this person, the author of this article, Aaron Carson, thinks it's acceptable
358380	363740	for me to go on an innocent channel with false troll accounts and spam it with YouTube disapproved
363740	367420	rhetoric until YouTube decides to ban that channel for my actions.
367420	370300	Nobody with a brain can think this is a good idea.
370300	375140	Gab browser extension puts a far right comment section on every site, and how dare they do
375140	376140	so.
376140	381760	The Dissenter plugin, even just dissenting now warrants scare quotes, allows Gab users
381760	387020	to discuss everything from tweets to Wikipedia pages in real time, without the fear of said
387020	389660	comment being removed by the site's moderators.
389660	393580	You know, I really think this is the online version of the overbearing helicopter parent
393580	397540	who wants to prevent their children from having any secrets, getting into any trouble,
397540	401820	or enjoying any fun until they're fucking 35, all the while forgetting what it was like
401820	402820	to be young themselves.
402820	406620	Now that they've lived through their own childhoods as free spirits, it's time for
406620	410220	the entirety of human existence to be tightly controlled and regulated.
410220	411820	It's hardly a unique idea.
411820	416900	Pre-Reddit social aggregator dig launched a comments tool in 2015 to encourage conversations
416900	420860	on newslinks, but Dissenter is clearly tailor-made for the Gab crowd.
420860	423620	And that reminds me, wasn't Dissenter made before?
423620	424620	Oh yeah.
424620	429100	I remember a web app like Dissenter 15 years ago, and it dried up because who gives a fuck
429100	431540	what a bunch of random trolls online think.
431540	433100	It was built by Google.
433100	434100	It didn't dry up.
434100	438380	They shut it down because the media, publishers, and advertisers lost their minds and pressured
438380	439380	them to.
439380	440380	We won't.
440380	441380	Trolls surface truth.
441380	445940	Truth is found in the comments section, always, which is why publishers shut them all down.
445940	447420	And here's the core of the matter.
447420	450840	Dissenter is something that people all across the internet, with the exception of the isolated
450840	455040	bubble that is the radical left, have been clamoring for for years now.
455040	458160	Of course, we should remember that censorship isn't a left-right issue.
458160	461720	Today's censors are on the left, sure, but the right has been the great censor in the
461720	463960	past, and they probably will be again in the future.
463960	468920	The common view of the censor, at least when I was young, was either a fascist or religious
468920	472220	fanatic, both figures commonly associated with the radical right.
472220	476760	But nowadays, it's the genderless, plaid-wearing, dyed-hair, hipster tech journal.
476760	481840	But regardless of their differences in politics, they all arbitrarily find some speech offensive
481840	486720	to their sensibilities, they all desire social control, and so they all censor.
486720	491200	If you hold an opinion, there's somebody, somewhere, who wants you to shut up.
491200	495120	And in regards to public discourse, progressives have created a list of prohibited words and
495120	500420	ideas, continually expanding it to include more and more speech as more and more people
500420	503040	voice their own individual special complaints.
503040	506640	With the common fear that, eventually, no speech at all will ever be allowed.
506640	511200	The real solution, though, is to not cave to any complaints in the first place.
511200	515600	As the ability for people to voice themselves dwindles, an ability that was and remains
515600	520400	the foundation of the entire internet, Dissenter re-enpowers the people in a monumental way.
520400	526280	In the current digitized world, trivial information is accumulating every second, preserved in
526280	530760	all its triteness, never fading, always accessible.
530760	535600	Rumors about petty issues, misinterpretations, slander.
535600	541960	All this junk data, preserved in an unfiltered state, growing at an alarming rate.
541960	545920	It will only slow down social progress, reduce the rate of evolution.
545920	546920	Right.
546920	550120	You seem to think that our plan is one of censorship.
550120	552000	Are you telling me it's not?
552000	553000	You're being silly.
553000	557680	What we propose to do is not to control content, but to create context.
558080	562000	In an age of curated content, where large companies dictate to their users that they
562000	567200	will enjoy safe, plastic wrapped, mindless, non-controversial media, Dissenter allows
567200	569080	people to debate and discuss again.
569080	573240	It allows things to actually trend instead of old media purchasing front page spots.
573240	577760	And it allows complaints to be freely aired without them being labeled as problematic.
577760	582180	YouTube and Facebook are going the way of Las Vegas, where what happened in Vegas stays
582180	587420	in Vegas was a saying that once actually referred to wild cocaine gangbangs, but is now only
587420	592100	uttered by obese moms in their fifties, sipping on fruity drinks, losing a couple hundred
592100	594780	bucks at the casino and turning in at 8 30 PM.
594780	598340	But the rough edges of the internet can't be rounded off the same way that Vegas is
598340	599900	or Times Squares have been.
599900	603460	I mentioned at the beginning of the video that smaller communities used to run their
603460	604740	own tiny forms.
604740	608020	The internet was once an endless frontier where everybody could carve out their own
608020	609820	little homestead in the wild.
609820	613940	But now a lot of these communities simply rely on Reddit subs or Facebook pages due
613940	615060	to the ease of it.
615060	616420	And for a lot of them, that's fine.
616420	621020	But as that list of prohibited words and ideas expands ever outward, more and more
621020	623400	people will be banned from these huge platforms.
623400	625920	Back in the day, if you were banned from a form, fine, whatever.
625920	627300	You move on to the next community.
627300	631060	But now when you're banned, you've been completely cut off from public discourse.
631060	634540	There is no going to the next one when there is only one.
634540	637980	Do that enough and people start to group together on the fringes of the internet.
637980	642260	When Gab popped up, both Silicon Valley and the left-leaning media realized that the internet
642260	646580	wasn't like Yu-Gi-Oh!, where banning somebody to the shadow realm wasn't just a clever
646580	654940	euphemism for killing someone.
654940	657540	When you ban somebody, they don't just vanish.
657540	661260	When you erect walls, the world beyond them continues to exist.
661260	666020	These tech giants centralized so much power that those who were banned had no alternative
666020	667100	but to innovate.
667100	671460	To center is the graffiti on the walls that big tech erected around their consolidated
671460	672460	internet.
672460	676860	Decentre has done something that, so far, Gab has unfortunately failed to do, and that's
676860	677860	go mainstream.
677860	683000	Gab's official Twitter account claims that 43% of Decentre users have commented using
683000	684000	the service.
684000	689400	In comparison, most platforms see an 8-9% usage rate, with 90% of people simply passively
689400	690980	consuming whatever's in front of them.
690980	694720	Some of this can be chalked up to Decentre being new, sure, but I do think a good chunk
694720	697580	of it is a genuine desire for people to have a voice again.
697580	700420	Honestly, the most fun I've had with Decentre is outside of the culture war.
700420	704260	I'll load it up on something completely apolitical and sometimes even ancient, like
704260	710380	a Wii U soft mod guide, or an old is it a good idea to microwave this video from 2007,
710380	714680	or instructions on how to cook the perfect stir fry, and I'll just leave a random message.
714680	718540	Something innocuous, something that somebody might not even see for another five years
718540	719540	or something.
719540	720780	It's like leaving behind a time capsule.
720780	722720	I hope Decentre continues to succeed.
722720	724700	It absolutely is a work in progress.
724700	728020	They've announced that they're creating their own trending pages for every single
728020	729020	domain.
729020	734020	Rather than dealing with, for example, YouTube's curated crap on the recommended page, we can
734020	737100	just see Decentre's neutral trending on YouTube selection.
737100	741040	In my opinion, I could also use a follow or friends feature so that you can see what people
741040	742820	you want to follow are commenting on.
742820	746300	But long term, I think Decentre's going to change the internet in a huge way, far
746300	749700	more than Gab ever could as a simple social media platform.
749700	752800	When I set up a new PC, there's a few things I do right off.
752800	757580	Replace Internet Explorer, get Discord and Skype, install basic useful apps like ImageBurn
757580	760240	and Recuva and Hardware Monitor and Steam.
760240	762900	I think the Decentre plugin is going on that list.
762900	764780	With it, the internet feels like home again.
764780	768520	It feels like I can voice my opinion and not have to worry about being blacklisted from
768520	771740	five different social media companies Alex Jones style.
771740	775900	Push comes to shove, I would rather be offended than be censored.
801740	805020	Long enough you're likely to come to believe it.
805020	811700	I spoke to somebody who said that when she watched her 15th Alex Jones Info Wars video,
811700	816540	he said something that made sense to her and it freaked her out because she had been trying
816540	820020	to keep her wits about her and trying to make sure that she didn't get taken down a rabbit
820020	823900	hole and all of a sudden she herself was starting to believe in these views.
823900	828820	So it seems like it's a really underexplored aspect of being a content moderator.
828820	833100	And of course the scary thing is you might only do this job for eight months, ten months,
833100	836260	but then you know these new beliefs that you have can last for a lot longer.
