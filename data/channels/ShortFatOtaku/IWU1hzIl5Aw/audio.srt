00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Hello my friends. This is a bit of a different video in that I don't really have any articles,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,360
and frankly not even much of a script. This is just going to be me giving my own thoughts

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,400
on the idea of pride. Pride has a dual nature. On the one hand, pride is considered to be a

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,720
positive trait. LGBTQ pride exists because traditionally LGBTQ people were shamed for

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,440
what the wider culture considered deviant behavior. Black pride, as defined by those

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,320
who espouse the position, is a response to the dominance of white cultures and encourages black

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,800
people to celebrate black culture and embrace their African heritage. And, because this is

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,880
how social justice likes to fractionate its identity politics, there seem to be pride

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,960
movements for just about everything out there. Autism pride, disability pride, furry pride,

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,200
hell there's even illegal immigrant pride or undocumented pride or whatever you want to call

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,200
it. If you've got an identity, then there's a pride movement for you. But on the other hand,

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,120
just because you've got an identity with a pride movement, doesn't mean it's automatically going

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,640
to be considered a good thing. White pride on the surface sounds like the mirror of black pride,

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,440
but is also the main slogan used by legitimate white supremacists. Straight pride sounds,

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,560
frankly, a little bit silly, but it was actually considered deadly serious by the alt-left,

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,040
considering just how much pushback the straight pride parade earlier this year received. And

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,280
there's a whole lot of public discourse right now surrounding the negativity of nationalism,

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,920
and what is nationalism if not national pride. But nationalism is where the discussion starts

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,800
to get a little bit weird, isn't it? Nationalist sentiments in the US or the UK are considered to

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,840
be oppressive by the social justice warriors. They view these nations as having uniquely problematic

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,960
pasts. So an American citizen with national pride for the US, or a British citizen with national

22
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,160
pride for the UK, are simply a part of that problem. But not all forms of nationalism are

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,840
considered to be bad by the SJWs. For example, they'll often see Israeli nationalism as horrifying,

24
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,400
but Palestinian nationalism as a moral obligation to support. Or, back in the UK,

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,840
they'll often view British nationalism as bad, but consider the remainers and their quasi-nationalistic

26
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,440
devotion to the European Union as having the correct form of nationalism. An EU nationalism

27
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,520
supporting continental unity. And then, when you get into ethnic pride, the whole thing really does

28
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,000
go out the window, doesn't it? French pride is problematic in France, but empowering in Canada.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,640
Aboriginal pride, Chinese pride, Jewish pride. Choose an ethnicity, and frankly, as long as

30
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,400
they're not predominantly native to Europe, they'll probably be considered beautiful instead

31
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,880
of oppressive. And even then, that's not a hard and fast rule, because Irish and Italian pride

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,800
are certainly more accepted in the US than British or German pride. And heaven forbid,

33
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,560
you're a person with open Taiwanese pride walking through a Chinatown. Pride has a dual nature.

34
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,040
There's a reason that religious types figured out that pride is both the greatest source of sin,

35
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,440
as well as the greatest form, as well as the greatest font of empowerment. Pride is equal

36
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,160
parts self-respect and arrogance. And I think the reason why the radical left swings between

37
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,880
extreme acceptance and extreme opposition of pride, depending on its source, is because they

38
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,000
don't understand that pride is both self-respect and arrogance at the same time. It's not that

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,760
some forms of pride are self-respect and other forms of pride are arrogance. That would be too

40
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,000
easy, and frankly, too convenient. That would just allow the opportunists to label their pride as

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
self-respect, their opponent's pride as arrogance, and call it a day. No. All pride is equal parts

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,880
self-respect and arrogance. And it is those two qualities at the exact same time. Because when

43
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,600
you get right down to it, people are not the anima of their demographics. People are individuals.

44
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,240
It's easy to see the self-respect in something like black pride. The ethnic story of African

45
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,480
Americans is of a people who survived the generational slavery and poverty. There is

46
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,480
self-respect to be found in that. But the black people of today claiming their ancestors'

47
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,120
accomplishments as their own is arrogance. Frankly, I don't think there's that many black

48
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,960
slaves left in the US anymore. And for a modern black person to talk as if they

49
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,640
personally know what slavery is like, and that the white people around them are personally

50
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,160
responsible for slavery, is where the arrogance comes in. The idea of pride as both self-respect

51
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,800
and arrogance at the same time can be mapped to any type of pride in this manner. Yes,

52
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,440
even something as near universally maligned as white pride. It will always be a form of

53
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,160
self-respect to appreciate your own immutable traits, whatever they may be, as an intrinsic

54
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,160
part of you, of which you have the exclusive right to enjoy in any way you like. And it

55
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,080
will always be a form of arrogance to believe that these immutable traits somehow give you

56
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,320
dominion over the hardships or the accomplishments of other people who just so happen to share

57
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,240
those same immutable traits with you. In other words, it's good to appreciate that you are

58
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,320
the inheritor of a legacy, whatever that legacy is. And it's not good to claim that just because

59
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,320
you've inherited that legacy, that the deeds of its previous inheritors are now your deeds.

60
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,680
Here's where gratitude comes in. I think the idea of pride is fundamentally flawed.

61
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,960
I think, even though pride is self-respect and arrogance at the same time, there is a better

62
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,280
way to conceptualize the situation, and that would be gratitude. When you're prideful of your race,

63
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,240
your ethnicity, your nation, even your sexuality, you have to constantly balance the dark side of

64
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,840
that pride. I understand why pride was originally chosen as the concept. For example, with LGBTQ

65
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,640
pride or Black pride, pushback against those movements was so overpowering that they required

66
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,120
an overshooting of the mark just to land in neutral territory. It's very much a, our opponents

67
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,680
are extremists, so we have to be extremists too, in order to reach middle ground mentality.

68
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,240
But that's simply the wrong model. I'm grateful for the heritage I've inherited. Not even in a

69
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,200
familial sense, though that obviously counts, but the cultural heritage of being Canadian,

70
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,680
and the British and French heritage that Canada spawned from. It includes personal freedom,

71
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,520
equality under the law, the consent of the governed, it's the heritage of liberalism.

72
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,640
But not just that, the racial heritage, the ethnic heritage, even other things like sexuality,

73
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,560
or talents, or interests, or local sub-heritage, or anything else that I was given at birth by

74
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,280
virtue of being born that I did not have to cultivate myself. I'm grateful for all that

75
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,760
stuff. I make no attempts at pride about it. I don't pretend that, just because I was given

76
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,560
a specific list of qualities at birth, that list is automatically better than somebody else's list

77
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,480
who might have had a different role at the dice. I'm simply grateful for what I do have.

78
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,560
That's why gratitude is better than pride. Pride is for people who believe the world is a zero-sum

79
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,720
game, where the less territory you stake for your team means the more territory other teams will

80
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,720
stake out for themselves. So everybody has to enter into the eternal power struggle. I would

81
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,640
guess that's why it appeals to the postmodernist left. But that's not how I see the world.

82
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,440
Unlike pride, gratitude is not an external claim that must be constantly enforced and reinforced

83
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,920
through grandiose statements or large public displays of egotism. Gratitude is internal.

84
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,720
It's understanding that evolution has worked for millions of years to create you. Yes, with all of

85
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,520
your flaws, but also with all of your merits. And the right path forward is taking what you've been

86
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,400
given and building onto it in your own unique way. If pride gets in the way of that, it's because

87
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,320
the prideful are too busy claiming what they've already inherited as their own accomplishments,

88
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,400
to actually accomplish anything themselves. As you live in your culture, it shapes you,

89
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,240
but you also shape it, and over the course of your life you become a part of that heritage.

90
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,560
And someday, somebody else will have the choice between being grateful for what you've given them

91
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,440
and continuing the work, or being prideful in what you've given them and claim your achievements as

92
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,600
theirs. I'm not even talking in terms of reproduction. Obviously having kids is one way

93
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,440
to leave a legacy behind. But there's many other ways to contribute to a heritage too.

94
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,120
What I mean is, every time I see a pride parade, or I see any identity-based movement or protest or

95
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,560
whatever, I see a person who has no personality outside of what they've inherited from others,

96
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,400
and therefore has nothing of their own to contribute to that heritage. I see a person

97
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,600
who does not shape politics, but merely acts it out. I see a person who has become so subsumed

98
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,480
in their pride that they've forgotten the virtue of humility. I see a person who isn't grateful

99
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,760
for what they've been given, beyond its use as a hammer to bludgeon their opponents. And frankly,

100
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,040
I've seen somebody who's missed the whole point. The whole point of pride, the whole point of

101
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,560
gratitude of all of it. Self-love doesn't mean being out and loud and proud, whatever it is

102
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,520
you're out about. In fact, if you had true self-love, you probably wouldn't even feel a

103
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,320
need to be loud and proud in the first place.
