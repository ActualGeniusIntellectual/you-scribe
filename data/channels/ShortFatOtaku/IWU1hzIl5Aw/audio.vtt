00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
Hello my friends. This is a bit of a different video in that I don't really have any articles,

00:04.640 --> 00:09.360
and frankly not even much of a script. This is just going to be me giving my own thoughts

00:09.360 --> 00:14.400
on the idea of pride. Pride has a dual nature. On the one hand, pride is considered to be a

00:14.400 --> 00:20.720
positive trait. LGBTQ pride exists because traditionally LGBTQ people were shamed for

00:20.720 --> 00:25.440
what the wider culture considered deviant behavior. Black pride, as defined by those

00:25.440 --> 00:30.320
who espouse the position, is a response to the dominance of white cultures and encourages black

00:30.320 --> 00:34.800
people to celebrate black culture and embrace their African heritage. And, because this is

00:34.800 --> 00:38.880
how social justice likes to fractionate its identity politics, there seem to be pride

00:38.880 --> 00:42.960
movements for just about everything out there. Autism pride, disability pride, furry pride,

00:42.960 --> 00:47.200
hell there's even illegal immigrant pride or undocumented pride or whatever you want to call

00:47.200 --> 00:51.200
it. If you've got an identity, then there's a pride movement for you. But on the other hand,

00:51.200 --> 00:55.120
just because you've got an identity with a pride movement, doesn't mean it's automatically going

00:55.120 --> 01:00.640
to be considered a good thing. White pride on the surface sounds like the mirror of black pride,

01:00.640 --> 01:05.440
but is also the main slogan used by legitimate white supremacists. Straight pride sounds,

01:05.440 --> 01:10.560
frankly, a little bit silly, but it was actually considered deadly serious by the alt-left,

01:10.560 --> 01:15.040
considering just how much pushback the straight pride parade earlier this year received. And

01:15.040 --> 01:19.280
there's a whole lot of public discourse right now surrounding the negativity of nationalism,

01:19.280 --> 01:23.920
and what is nationalism if not national pride. But nationalism is where the discussion starts

01:23.920 --> 01:28.800
to get a little bit weird, isn't it? Nationalist sentiments in the US or the UK are considered to

01:28.800 --> 01:33.840
be oppressive by the social justice warriors. They view these nations as having uniquely problematic

01:33.840 --> 01:38.960
pasts. So an American citizen with national pride for the US, or a British citizen with national

01:38.960 --> 01:44.160
pride for the UK, are simply a part of that problem. But not all forms of nationalism are

01:44.160 --> 01:49.840
considered to be bad by the SJWs. For example, they'll often see Israeli nationalism as horrifying,

01:49.840 --> 01:54.400
but Palestinian nationalism as a moral obligation to support. Or, back in the UK,

01:54.400 --> 01:59.840
they'll often view British nationalism as bad, but consider the remainers and their quasi-nationalistic

01:59.840 --> 02:05.440
devotion to the European Union as having the correct form of nationalism. An EU nationalism

02:05.440 --> 02:09.520
supporting continental unity. And then, when you get into ethnic pride, the whole thing really does

02:09.520 --> 02:14.000
go out the window, doesn't it? French pride is problematic in France, but empowering in Canada.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.640
Aboriginal pride, Chinese pride, Jewish pride. Choose an ethnicity, and frankly, as long as

02:18.640 --> 02:22.400
they're not predominantly native to Europe, they'll probably be considered beautiful instead

02:22.400 --> 02:26.880
of oppressive. And even then, that's not a hard and fast rule, because Irish and Italian pride

02:26.880 --> 02:30.800
are certainly more accepted in the US than British or German pride. And heaven forbid,

02:30.800 --> 02:36.560
you're a person with open Taiwanese pride walking through a Chinatown. Pride has a dual nature.

02:36.560 --> 02:41.040
There's a reason that religious types figured out that pride is both the greatest source of sin,

02:41.040 --> 02:45.440
as well as the greatest form, as well as the greatest font of empowerment. Pride is equal

02:45.440 --> 02:50.160
parts self-respect and arrogance. And I think the reason why the radical left swings between

02:50.160 --> 02:54.880
extreme acceptance and extreme opposition of pride, depending on its source, is because they

02:54.880 --> 03:00.000
don't understand that pride is both self-respect and arrogance at the same time. It's not that

03:00.000 --> 03:03.760
some forms of pride are self-respect and other forms of pride are arrogance. That would be too

03:03.760 --> 03:08.000
easy, and frankly, too convenient. That would just allow the opportunists to label their pride as

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
self-respect, their opponent's pride as arrogance, and call it a day. No. All pride is equal parts

03:14.000 --> 03:18.880
self-respect and arrogance. And it is those two qualities at the exact same time. Because when

03:18.880 --> 03:23.600
you get right down to it, people are not the anima of their demographics. People are individuals.

03:23.600 --> 03:28.240
It's easy to see the self-respect in something like black pride. The ethnic story of African

03:28.240 --> 03:32.480
Americans is of a people who survived the generational slavery and poverty. There is

03:32.480 --> 03:36.480
self-respect to be found in that. But the black people of today claiming their ancestors'

03:36.480 --> 03:41.120
accomplishments as their own is arrogance. Frankly, I don't think there's that many black

03:41.120 --> 03:44.960
slaves left in the US anymore. And for a modern black person to talk as if they

03:44.960 --> 03:48.640
personally know what slavery is like, and that the white people around them are personally

03:48.640 --> 03:54.160
responsible for slavery, is where the arrogance comes in. The idea of pride as both self-respect

03:54.160 --> 03:58.800
and arrogance at the same time can be mapped to any type of pride in this manner. Yes,

03:58.800 --> 04:03.440
even something as near universally maligned as white pride. It will always be a form of

04:03.440 --> 04:08.160
self-respect to appreciate your own immutable traits, whatever they may be, as an intrinsic

04:08.160 --> 04:12.160
part of you, of which you have the exclusive right to enjoy in any way you like. And it

04:12.160 --> 04:16.080
will always be a form of arrogance to believe that these immutable traits somehow give you

04:16.080 --> 04:20.320
dominion over the hardships or the accomplishments of other people who just so happen to share

04:20.320 --> 04:24.240
those same immutable traits with you. In other words, it's good to appreciate that you are

04:24.240 --> 04:28.320
the inheritor of a legacy, whatever that legacy is. And it's not good to claim that just because

04:28.320 --> 04:32.320
you've inherited that legacy, that the deeds of its previous inheritors are now your deeds.

04:32.320 --> 04:37.680
Here's where gratitude comes in. I think the idea of pride is fundamentally flawed.

04:38.480 --> 04:42.960
I think, even though pride is self-respect and arrogance at the same time, there is a better

04:42.960 --> 04:47.280
way to conceptualize the situation, and that would be gratitude. When you're prideful of your race,

04:47.280 --> 04:52.240
your ethnicity, your nation, even your sexuality, you have to constantly balance the dark side of

04:52.240 --> 04:57.840
that pride. I understand why pride was originally chosen as the concept. For example, with LGBTQ

04:57.840 --> 05:02.640
pride or Black pride, pushback against those movements was so overpowering that they required

05:02.640 --> 05:07.120
an overshooting of the mark just to land in neutral territory. It's very much a, our opponents

05:07.120 --> 05:11.680
are extremists, so we have to be extremists too, in order to reach middle ground mentality.

05:11.680 --> 05:16.240
But that's simply the wrong model. I'm grateful for the heritage I've inherited. Not even in a

05:16.240 --> 05:21.200
familial sense, though that obviously counts, but the cultural heritage of being Canadian,

05:21.200 --> 05:25.680
and the British and French heritage that Canada spawned from. It includes personal freedom,

05:25.680 --> 05:29.520
equality under the law, the consent of the governed, it's the heritage of liberalism.

05:29.520 --> 05:34.640
But not just that, the racial heritage, the ethnic heritage, even other things like sexuality,

05:34.640 --> 05:40.560
or talents, or interests, or local sub-heritage, or anything else that I was given at birth by

05:40.560 --> 05:45.280
virtue of being born that I did not have to cultivate myself. I'm grateful for all that

05:45.280 --> 05:49.760
stuff. I make no attempts at pride about it. I don't pretend that, just because I was given

05:49.760 --> 05:54.560
a specific list of qualities at birth, that list is automatically better than somebody else's list

05:54.560 --> 05:58.480
who might have had a different role at the dice. I'm simply grateful for what I do have.

05:58.480 --> 06:02.560
That's why gratitude is better than pride. Pride is for people who believe the world is a zero-sum

06:02.560 --> 06:06.720
game, where the less territory you stake for your team means the more territory other teams will

06:06.720 --> 06:10.720
stake out for themselves. So everybody has to enter into the eternal power struggle. I would

06:10.720 --> 06:14.640
guess that's why it appeals to the postmodernist left. But that's not how I see the world.

06:14.640 --> 06:19.440
Unlike pride, gratitude is not an external claim that must be constantly enforced and reinforced

06:19.440 --> 06:23.920
through grandiose statements or large public displays of egotism. Gratitude is internal.

06:23.920 --> 06:28.720
It's understanding that evolution has worked for millions of years to create you. Yes, with all of

06:28.720 --> 06:33.520
your flaws, but also with all of your merits. And the right path forward is taking what you've been

06:33.520 --> 06:38.400
given and building onto it in your own unique way. If pride gets in the way of that, it's because

06:38.400 --> 06:42.320
the prideful are too busy claiming what they've already inherited as their own accomplishments,

06:42.320 --> 06:46.400
to actually accomplish anything themselves. As you live in your culture, it shapes you,

06:46.400 --> 06:50.240
but you also shape it, and over the course of your life you become a part of that heritage.

06:50.240 --> 06:54.560
And someday, somebody else will have the choice between being grateful for what you've given them

06:54.560 --> 06:59.440
and continuing the work, or being prideful in what you've given them and claim your achievements as

06:59.440 --> 07:03.600
theirs. I'm not even talking in terms of reproduction. Obviously having kids is one way

07:03.600 --> 07:07.440
to leave a legacy behind. But there's many other ways to contribute to a heritage too.

07:07.440 --> 07:13.120
What I mean is, every time I see a pride parade, or I see any identity-based movement or protest or

07:13.120 --> 07:18.560
whatever, I see a person who has no personality outside of what they've inherited from others,

07:18.560 --> 07:22.400
and therefore has nothing of their own to contribute to that heritage. I see a person

07:22.400 --> 07:27.600
who does not shape politics, but merely acts it out. I see a person who has become so subsumed

07:27.600 --> 07:32.480
in their pride that they've forgotten the virtue of humility. I see a person who isn't grateful

07:32.480 --> 07:37.760
for what they've been given, beyond its use as a hammer to bludgeon their opponents. And frankly,

07:38.640 --> 07:43.040
I've seen somebody who's missed the whole point. The whole point of pride, the whole point of

07:43.040 --> 07:48.560
gratitude of all of it. Self-love doesn't mean being out and loud and proud, whatever it is

07:48.560 --> 07:53.520
you're out about. In fact, if you had true self-love, you probably wouldn't even feel a

07:53.520 --> 07:56.320
need to be loud and proud in the first place.
