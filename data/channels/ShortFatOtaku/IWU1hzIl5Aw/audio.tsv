0	4640	Hello my friends. This is a bit of a different video in that I don't really have any articles,
4640	9360	and frankly not even much of a script. This is just going to be me giving my own thoughts
9360	14400	on the idea of pride. Pride has a dual nature. On the one hand, pride is considered to be a
14400	20720	positive trait. LGBTQ pride exists because traditionally LGBTQ people were shamed for
20720	25440	what the wider culture considered deviant behavior. Black pride, as defined by those
25440	30320	who espouse the position, is a response to the dominance of white cultures and encourages black
30320	34800	people to celebrate black culture and embrace their African heritage. And, because this is
34800	38880	how social justice likes to fractionate its identity politics, there seem to be pride
38880	42960	movements for just about everything out there. Autism pride, disability pride, furry pride,
42960	47200	hell there's even illegal immigrant pride or undocumented pride or whatever you want to call
47200	51200	it. If you've got an identity, then there's a pride movement for you. But on the other hand,
51200	55120	just because you've got an identity with a pride movement, doesn't mean it's automatically going
55120	60640	to be considered a good thing. White pride on the surface sounds like the mirror of black pride,
60640	65440	but is also the main slogan used by legitimate white supremacists. Straight pride sounds,
65440	70560	frankly, a little bit silly, but it was actually considered deadly serious by the alt-left,
70560	75040	considering just how much pushback the straight pride parade earlier this year received. And
75040	79280	there's a whole lot of public discourse right now surrounding the negativity of nationalism,
79280	83920	and what is nationalism if not national pride. But nationalism is where the discussion starts
83920	88800	to get a little bit weird, isn't it? Nationalist sentiments in the US or the UK are considered to
88800	93840	be oppressive by the social justice warriors. They view these nations as having uniquely problematic
93840	98960	pasts. So an American citizen with national pride for the US, or a British citizen with national
98960	104160	pride for the UK, are simply a part of that problem. But not all forms of nationalism are
104160	109840	considered to be bad by the SJWs. For example, they'll often see Israeli nationalism as horrifying,
109840	114400	but Palestinian nationalism as a moral obligation to support. Or, back in the UK,
114400	119840	they'll often view British nationalism as bad, but consider the remainers and their quasi-nationalistic
119840	125440	devotion to the European Union as having the correct form of nationalism. An EU nationalism
125440	129520	supporting continental unity. And then, when you get into ethnic pride, the whole thing really does
129520	134000	go out the window, doesn't it? French pride is problematic in France, but empowering in Canada.
134000	138640	Aboriginal pride, Chinese pride, Jewish pride. Choose an ethnicity, and frankly, as long as
138640	142400	they're not predominantly native to Europe, they'll probably be considered beautiful instead
142400	146880	of oppressive. And even then, that's not a hard and fast rule, because Irish and Italian pride
146880	150800	are certainly more accepted in the US than British or German pride. And heaven forbid,
150800	156560	you're a person with open Taiwanese pride walking through a Chinatown. Pride has a dual nature.
156560	161040	There's a reason that religious types figured out that pride is both the greatest source of sin,
161040	165440	as well as the greatest form, as well as the greatest font of empowerment. Pride is equal
165440	170160	parts self-respect and arrogance. And I think the reason why the radical left swings between
170160	174880	extreme acceptance and extreme opposition of pride, depending on its source, is because they
174880	180000	don't understand that pride is both self-respect and arrogance at the same time. It's not that
180000	183760	some forms of pride are self-respect and other forms of pride are arrogance. That would be too
183760	188000	easy, and frankly, too convenient. That would just allow the opportunists to label their pride as
188000	194000	self-respect, their opponent's pride as arrogance, and call it a day. No. All pride is equal parts
194000	198880	self-respect and arrogance. And it is those two qualities at the exact same time. Because when
198880	203600	you get right down to it, people are not the anima of their demographics. People are individuals.
203600	208240	It's easy to see the self-respect in something like black pride. The ethnic story of African
208240	212480	Americans is of a people who survived the generational slavery and poverty. There is
212480	216480	self-respect to be found in that. But the black people of today claiming their ancestors'
216480	221120	accomplishments as their own is arrogance. Frankly, I don't think there's that many black
221120	224960	slaves left in the US anymore. And for a modern black person to talk as if they
224960	228640	personally know what slavery is like, and that the white people around them are personally
228640	234160	responsible for slavery, is where the arrogance comes in. The idea of pride as both self-respect
234160	238800	and arrogance at the same time can be mapped to any type of pride in this manner. Yes,
238800	243440	even something as near universally maligned as white pride. It will always be a form of
243440	248160	self-respect to appreciate your own immutable traits, whatever they may be, as an intrinsic
248160	252160	part of you, of which you have the exclusive right to enjoy in any way you like. And it
252160	256080	will always be a form of arrogance to believe that these immutable traits somehow give you
256080	260320	dominion over the hardships or the accomplishments of other people who just so happen to share
260320	264240	those same immutable traits with you. In other words, it's good to appreciate that you are
264240	268320	the inheritor of a legacy, whatever that legacy is. And it's not good to claim that just because
268320	272320	you've inherited that legacy, that the deeds of its previous inheritors are now your deeds.
272320	277680	Here's where gratitude comes in. I think the idea of pride is fundamentally flawed.
278480	282960	I think, even though pride is self-respect and arrogance at the same time, there is a better
282960	287280	way to conceptualize the situation, and that would be gratitude. When you're prideful of your race,
287280	292240	your ethnicity, your nation, even your sexuality, you have to constantly balance the dark side of
292240	297840	that pride. I understand why pride was originally chosen as the concept. For example, with LGBTQ
297840	302640	pride or Black pride, pushback against those movements was so overpowering that they required
302640	307120	an overshooting of the mark just to land in neutral territory. It's very much a, our opponents
307120	311680	are extremists, so we have to be extremists too, in order to reach middle ground mentality.
311680	316240	But that's simply the wrong model. I'm grateful for the heritage I've inherited. Not even in a
316240	321200	familial sense, though that obviously counts, but the cultural heritage of being Canadian,
321200	325680	and the British and French heritage that Canada spawned from. It includes personal freedom,
325680	329520	equality under the law, the consent of the governed, it's the heritage of liberalism.
329520	334640	But not just that, the racial heritage, the ethnic heritage, even other things like sexuality,
334640	340560	or talents, or interests, or local sub-heritage, or anything else that I was given at birth by
340560	345280	virtue of being born that I did not have to cultivate myself. I'm grateful for all that
345280	349760	stuff. I make no attempts at pride about it. I don't pretend that, just because I was given
349760	354560	a specific list of qualities at birth, that list is automatically better than somebody else's list
354560	358480	who might have had a different role at the dice. I'm simply grateful for what I do have.
358480	362560	That's why gratitude is better than pride. Pride is for people who believe the world is a zero-sum
362560	366720	game, where the less territory you stake for your team means the more territory other teams will
366720	370720	stake out for themselves. So everybody has to enter into the eternal power struggle. I would
370720	374640	guess that's why it appeals to the postmodernist left. But that's not how I see the world.
374640	379440	Unlike pride, gratitude is not an external claim that must be constantly enforced and reinforced
379440	383920	through grandiose statements or large public displays of egotism. Gratitude is internal.
383920	388720	It's understanding that evolution has worked for millions of years to create you. Yes, with all of
388720	393520	your flaws, but also with all of your merits. And the right path forward is taking what you've been
393520	398400	given and building onto it in your own unique way. If pride gets in the way of that, it's because
398400	402320	the prideful are too busy claiming what they've already inherited as their own accomplishments,
402320	406400	to actually accomplish anything themselves. As you live in your culture, it shapes you,
406400	410240	but you also shape it, and over the course of your life you become a part of that heritage.
410240	414560	And someday, somebody else will have the choice between being grateful for what you've given them
414560	419440	and continuing the work, or being prideful in what you've given them and claim your achievements as
419440	423600	theirs. I'm not even talking in terms of reproduction. Obviously having kids is one way
423600	427440	to leave a legacy behind. But there's many other ways to contribute to a heritage too.
427440	433120	What I mean is, every time I see a pride parade, or I see any identity-based movement or protest or
433120	438560	whatever, I see a person who has no personality outside of what they've inherited from others,
438560	442400	and therefore has nothing of their own to contribute to that heritage. I see a person
442400	447600	who does not shape politics, but merely acts it out. I see a person who has become so subsumed
447600	452480	in their pride that they've forgotten the virtue of humility. I see a person who isn't grateful
452480	457760	for what they've been given, beyond its use as a hammer to bludgeon their opponents. And frankly,
458640	463040	I've seen somebody who's missed the whole point. The whole point of pride, the whole point of
463040	468560	gratitude of all of it. Self-love doesn't mean being out and loud and proud, whatever it is
468560	473520	you're out about. In fact, if you had true self-love, you probably wouldn't even feel a
473520	476320	need to be loud and proud in the first place.
