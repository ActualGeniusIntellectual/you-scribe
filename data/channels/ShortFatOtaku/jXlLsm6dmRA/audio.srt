1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,480
So, E3 has come and gone for another year.

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,120
That's the Electronics Entertainment Expo, by the way.

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,400
It's the year's largest video game trade show, where companies gather in LA to show

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,020
off their upcoming games and hardware for the new year.

5
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,220
My friends and I watched all the major conferences on our gaming channel, in fact, including

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,500
the absolute shitshow that was Devolver Digital's conference.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,980
But the game that stood out the most to me was The Last Knight, and you can probably

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,940
see why just by looking at the trailer.

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,220
I know that the 2D pixel indie thing is certainly a huge trend right now, but this is different

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,500
than say Mega Man 9, Shovel Knight, or Stardew Valley.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,940
Those were all good looking quality games in their own right, but The Last Knight, in

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,960
my opinion, is on another level entirely, with the amazing lighting effects, the perspective

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,640
and scaling, and the sheer detail of the pixel art.

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,080
In fact, The Last Knight ended up being one of the most talked about games of this year's

15
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,960
E3, with only the Metroid Prime 4 announcement significantly surpassing it on social media.

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,200
It was, by far, the most talked about indie title of the convention, but as we'll soon

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,480
see, not all of the social media buzz regarding The Last Knight was positive.

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,700
The Last Knight was a surprise out of nowhere hit during the Xbox conference.

19
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,700
This conference was unique among E3 conferences in that it had very little showmanship, with

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,620
the exception of a car on stage at the beginning as advertisement for a new racing title that

21
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,620
most gamers probably don't give a shit about.

22
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,740
You can generally tell when a company has very little to show at E3.

23
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,780
They'll pad the conference out with something like a sitar band playing in front of a waterfall

24
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,100
light show, or a nostalgic montage that tugs at an old gamer's heartstrings but brings

25
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,340
nothing to the table.

26
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,060
On the flip side, when a company has actual content to show, they often proudly announce

27
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,860
that they're just going to machine gun fire game trailers at the audience, and The Last

28
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,620
Knight made its first debut as one of those many bullets during the Xbox conference.

29
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,580
So right out the gate, The Last Knight was up against some pretty hefty competition,

30
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,060
and yet still managed to be the sleeper hit of the show.

31
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,900
And that got a lot of people talking.

32
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,620
As well as looking into who exactly was responsible for the game's development, which is where

33
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,580
we hit our social media snag.

34
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,460
Meet Tim Saray, one of the two Frenchman brothers who run the indie company Odd Tales, which

35
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,700
contrary to my initial knee-jerk reaction has nothing to do with the Oddworld franchise.

36
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,860
Tim Saray, years before The Last Knight's trailer took E3 by storm, made a few tweets

37
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,860
that some people might consider wrongthink, but that the rest of us just see as healthy

38
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,860
skepticism.

39
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,860
Let's look at them.

40
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,740
I'm against feminism, because it's getting more and more skewed.

41
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,620
I am for egalitarianism.

42
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,300
I don't care boy, girl, alien.

43
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,060
And feminism now forces you to think from the woman point of view, whereas egalitarianism

44
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,380
is really universal.

45
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,980
These tweets tap into the larger conversation of feminism versus egalitarianism.

46
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,420
Proponents of feminism claim that it is inherently egalitarian, because they believe that women

47
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,500
are disadvantaged, and that egalitarianism is achieved by lifting women up to the level

48
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
of men.

49
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,320
Strict egalitarianism proponents, meanwhile, claim that feminism's exclusive focus on

50
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,900
women is anti-egalitarian in nature, as it fails to take into account instances where

51
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,280
men may be disadvantaged, where men face problems unique to their gender that women have no

52
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,880
experience with, or where both genders face similar problems, but only women receive assistance

53
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
for it.

54
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,560
In essence, the argument boils down to this picture.

55
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,840
The frame on the left is equality, where each person is treated the same, regardless of

56
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,920
their individual needs, and the frame on the right shows an uneven distribution of social

57
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,840
assistance, represented by crates, according to each individual's needs.

58
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,480
The right frame does paint a compelling argument.

59
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,040
For example, of course the sick or the homeless should receive social assistance that a healthy,

60
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,740
wealthy person may not need.

61
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,140
But when this idea falls apart is when you apply it to gender.

62
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,380
Do you really believe that this taller individual is an accurate representation of men, as a

63
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,620
class of people?

64
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,700
Do you really believe that the child accurately represents women?

65
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,400
Applying this form of equity to gender simply means that the person doing the application

66
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,020
believes women are inherently weaker or inferior, and that they need society to lift them up

67
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,020
to equal standing.

68
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,940
I don't think I'm reading too much into it when I say that Tim Saray's tweets are

69
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,940
part of this argument.

70
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,180
He doesn't mention the crate metaphor, but he doesn't have to.

71
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,800
His belief in strict egalitarianism over feminism here is a stand-in for a much larger

72
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,780
conversation that won't fit into 140 characters.

73
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,820
That Tim believes that individual women can be just as strong, powerful, and capable as

74
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,100
individual men.

75
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:31,020
And it is vitally more important that society treat everyone equally, aka equality of opportunity,

76
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,900
rather than force equity simply for the sake of quotas and representation, aka equality

77
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,900
of outcome.

78
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,700
And this is one of the big reasons that SJWs went after him like a pack of hyenas after

79
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,700
the Xbox conference.

80
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,620
But it's not the only one.

81
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,140
People who blame art and entertainment for society's ills are always on the wrong side

82
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,140
of history.

83
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,820
Hashtag gamergate, hashtag not your shield.

84
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,180
Oh my.

85
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,540
If conservative Christians campaigning against D&D, rock and roll, and video games still

86
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,700
had any political clout, they'd be coming after you right now, Tim.

87
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,980
Oh well, I guess our friend Anita Sarkeesian will have to do.

88
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,640
She's ideologically close enough.

89
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,360
Our game The Last Knight will take place in a cyberpunk world where modern feminism won

90
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,840
instead of egalitarianism.

91
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,720
I find it interesting to show the danger of extreme progressivism in the background of

92
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,640
the game, the characters, and the story.

93
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,440
Finally, we'll have another take on cyberpunk oppression instead of Big Brother, 1984, HAL,

94
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
and big companies.

95
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,640
What if the surveillance, bullying, marginalization won't come from governments, but from the

96
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
internet?

97
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,660
That actually sounds like a really, really interesting idea for a game world.

98
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,480
Maybe not an entire game on its own, because I have a feeling that it would get way too

99
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
preachy.

100
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,760
If a game tries to be a critique of a specific method of constructing society, it often trips

101
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,340
over its own soapbox, the Bioshock series being a great example, but I'm still extremely

102
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,860
interested in this concept, and I hope it survives to make it into the release version

103
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,040
of The Last Knight.

104
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,840
That may be in jeopardy, however, because after the Xbox conference, Tim Sarkees got

105
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,940
absolutely dogpiled on social media for allegedly shoehorning an anti-regressive left message

106
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,940
into his game.

107
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,000
But wait, Kotaku, and other shitty regressive game journal sites, I thought it was important

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,540
for game devs to include politics in their games.

109
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,120
In fact, I thought it was ridiculous of Gamergate to want games to be apolitical.

110
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,560
Oh, oh, does that only apply to your politics?

111
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,680
Is it suddenly gross, or not okay, or some other bit of childish terminology, when somebody

112
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,980
takes your ideology, your pet projects, and extrapolates them into the dystopian nightmare

113
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,480
and result that they would inevitably lead us to if you and your kind ever got ahold

114
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,920
of serious institutional power?

115
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,120
I guess somebody like that absolutely would need censoring, wouldn't they?

116
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,360
The next day, PC gaming conference went live at E3, hosted by the Hearthstone streamer

117
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
Day9.

118
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,000
Or about two thirds of Day9.

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,480
Good job at losing the weight, dude.

120
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,680
When The Last Knight's PC version was scheduled to be shown, Tim Sarkees hit the stage and

121
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,800
profusely apologized for the aforementioned tweets during the height of Gamergate.

122
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,600
He also tweeted about it later, stating,

123
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,760
And I'm more interested in judging people by the ideas that they hold than the labels

124
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,080
they define themselves with.

125
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,200
I do, in fact, personally know people who are absolutely egalitarians, but call themselves

126
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
feminists.

127
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,000
And I've also met feminists who are more interested in female supremacy than gender

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,040
equality.

129
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,560
Often this comes down to a case-by-case thing, and I don't think it's inherently immoral

130
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,360
or anything to critique feminism.

131
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,760
Tim, this is not something to apologize for.

132
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,760
3.

133
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,260
The fictional setting of the game does challenge techno-social progress as a whole, but certainly

134
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,380
not trying to promote regressive ideas.

135
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,540
This honestly sounds like he's trying to do a PR spin.

136
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,260
Technosocial progress refers specifically, in this case, to automation, and the universal

137
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,460
basic income that some people believe society must adopt in order to prevent massive societal

138
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,460
collapse.

139
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,460
Know how I know this?

140
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,260
From this old description of The Last Knight that has since been pulled.

141
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,820
Humans first knew the era of survival, then they knew the era of work.

142
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,940
Now they live in the era of leisure.

143
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,540
Machines have surpassed human labor not only in strength but in precision, intellect, and

144
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,540
creativity.

145
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,560
Stabilized by universal income, people struggle to find their calling or identity, and define

146
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,500
themselves by what they consume rather than what they create.

147
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,360
The Last Knight immerses you in the everyday life of Charlie, a second-class citizen living

148
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,720
in a city brimming with augmentation and citizens living a gamified existence, none of which

149
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,500
Charlie can experience himself due to a childhood accident.

150
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,060
Apathetic and disheartened by the seemingly pointless world around him, Charlie is presented

151
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,380
an opportunity to take matters into his own hands.

152
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,880
But at what risk?

153
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,300
This does sound like a really interesting concept for a game world.

154
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,380
Assuming the real-world effects of universal basic income is well beyond the scope of this

155
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,820
video, I'm not sure it would completely destroy everyone's passions like this description

156
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,900
says it would, but I think it would absolutely do that to at least a section of the population.

157
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,460
A future video topic, maybe.

158
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,320
But as far as The Last Knight is concerned, it's a great setup.

159
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,600
Humanity wants for nothing, but in the process, has lost something core to its being.

160
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,180
It sounds like it's got people jacking themselves willing into a Matrix-style VR pleasure parlor,

161
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,380
which the hero bitterly cannot participate in.

162
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,660
It smacks of Fight Club with meaningless consumerism desperately and unsuccessfully filling an existential

163
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,660
void.

164
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,260
And of course, there's Blade Runner.

165
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,940
Lots and lots of Blade Runner.

166
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,100
If The Last Knight continues to challenge techno-social progress, as originally described

167
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,820
in the game's first background blurb, Tim Cerae's vision still may be intact in the

168
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,140
final release, regardless of the social media backlash from SJWs and the regressive left.

169
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,700
In fact, I decided to go and see what Tim's original vision for The Last Knight was for

170
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,700
myself.

171
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,420
It's not commonly known that The Last Knight was originally a Flash game made by Tim years

172
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,420
ago.

173
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,780
It's certainly cruder than its newer counterpart, but the heart and soul the game persists.

174
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:04,360
The original The Last Knight was envisioned as an entry to the Cyberpunk Jam, a contest

175
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,180
run by Deviever that spanned from March 1st, 2014 to March 12th, 2014.

176
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,380
In that timeframe, indie developers were invited to quickly create a game from scratch, with

177
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,700
all entries using the Cyberpunk theme.

178
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,220
The Last Knight was awarded first place in the Cyberpunk Jam, with sub-rankings of 1st

179
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,060
in Aesthetics, 4th in Synergy, 4th in Polish, and 31st in Relevance.

180
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,900
As a quick side note, those of you from the old days of Gamergate will recognize the

181
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,060
name Deviever, but really, there's not much of a story here.

182
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,220
She's also gone by Grace Lynn, PixelGoth, and a few other names.

183
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,920
She used to make guitar pedals, but sold the brand, and then maybe re-bought it back?

184
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,160
She used to be pro-GG, and then was anti, and then was pro again.

185
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,480
She started Patreons and Kickstarters galore, and played both sides for a few small sums

186
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
of money.

187
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,480
She used to be involved in real life with Chobitcoin and Battlefield Trip, two other

188
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,160
gamergate flip floppers who used the hashtag to raise money for unrelated shit, like dental

189
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
surgery.

190
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,660
Honestly, I think the whole thing is just personal drama, with their entire crowd being

191
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,140
made up of a bunch of cancerous fraudsters.

192
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,120
She even stole a shoe on heads trademark choker.

193
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,120
But in the end, there's nothing here.

194
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,140
No corruption or collusion, just a familiar name that brought back a few memories.

195
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,840
As for The Last Knight's original Flash incarnation, it's very simplistic, but you

196
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,920
can absolutely see the original ideas of Tim and Adrian Saray begin to take shape.

197
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,920
In just two short minutes of gameplay, The Last Knight conveys the idea of living as

198
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,900
a permanent outsider in a decadent futuristic culture, surrounded by constant surveillance.

199
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,120
It almost feels like a very primitive Deus Ex in its theming.

200
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,120
But is it a generic anti-big government or anti-big corporation cyberpunk dystopia, like

201
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,680
most others of the genre?

202
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,280
Or does the very specific World War Xtreme Progressivism I idea shine through?

203
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,860
It's hard to say either way.

204
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,240
There's just not enough to go on in the Flash version.

205
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,320
But nonetheless, it's very well done.

206
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,560
In the end, I have no problem with stating unequivocally that Tim Saray did nothing wrong.

207
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,000
Maybe he's legitimately changed his views between 2014 and now, and no longer wants

208
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,680
to make an anti-radical leftist cyberpunk game.

209
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,840
If so, that's entirely fine with me.

210
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,600
I'll still play and probably enjoy The Last Knight, but I find it more likely that he's

211
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,480
been browbeaten and censored by the very vocal minority of GamesPress and Twitter SJWs

212
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,480
into either giving lip service to the ideas that The Last Knight is critiquing, or removing

213
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,840
the critique from the game entirely.

214
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,600
And if that's the case, Tim, I'll say to you what I said to many other small indie

215
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,660
devs back during Gamergate's height.

216
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,820
You don't need to rely on them.

217
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,340
The shitty journos, the regressive SJW devs with their connections.

218
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,340
The clique.

219
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,380
The clique does not have to be your audience.

220
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,840
The clique is over.

221
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,800
Look at the hype your game has garnered.

222
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,400
You went from winning a game jam nobody had ever heard of, to hitting the stage of two

223
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,760
E3 conferences this past year.

224
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,060
People are talking about your game all over the internet.

225
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,340
And despite what's bubbled to the top of your feed, it's been mostly positive.

226
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,120
YouTubers will be lining up to do reviews and day one let's plays of The Last Knight,

227
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
myself included.

228
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,920
It's only a small vocal minority that actually cares about this shit that's been slung

229
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,000
at you.

230
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,400
And they really are very, very small, with only a tiny amount of influence that continues

231
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,320
to wane day by day.

232
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,880
You want proof of this?

233
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,400
The On Good and Evil 2 announcement trailer was great in many ways, but when they mentioned

234
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,320
diversity it was only a small crowd at the back of the auditorium that gave the tiniest

235
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:38,800
chirping of a cheer.

236
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:53,720
That's not because everybody else in attendance was against diversity or something.

237
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,680
It's because everybody else knows that diversity in video games, or more broadly diversity

238
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,040
in sci-fi, has been a non-issue ever since Kirk Kistuhura back in 1968.

239
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,960
It's been a non-issue elsewhere as well.

240
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,280
It is completely disingenuous for young feminists to let out a long sigh and a FINALLY at the

241
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,240
new Wonder Woman movie when film is filled with strong, principled female leads.

242
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,680
And the same goes with the animation scene as well.

243
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,780
Japan, of all places, has seen to it that women take the center stage as heroines, protectors

244
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,520
and dispensers of justice for an extremely long time now.

245
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,520
What I'm saying, Tim, is that if you haven't changed, and you still hold the view as you

246
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,620
used to, you do not need to bend the knee to these people.

247
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,040
They hold no power over you.

248
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,160
Don't let them beat your artistic vision into submission with their baseless threats.

249
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,200
Your audience will play your game regardless.

250
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,720
YouTubers and streamers will promote it regardless.

251
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,340
And honestly, even with your apology, these dying outlets with their dead inside supporters

252
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,100
will likely slander you anyway.

253
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,560
In my opinion, that's the biggest difference between those who supported Gamergate, or the

254
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,360
skeptic community or whatever you want to call them, and the SJW crowd.

255
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,220
We generally have a capacity to forgive that they lack.

256
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,980
When Ian Miles-Chiang apologized, and worked extremely hard to rebuild his reputation and

257
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,140
brand among gamers, we accepted him back into the fold.

258
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,400
When Laci Green decided to simply hold a dialogue with us, not even change her position, just

259
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,820
speak to us, we accepted her, and her former supporters burnt her at the stake.

260
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,780
And this is already happening to you, Tim.

261
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,060
You've apologized, and they haven't forgiven you.

262
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,900
They expect you to toe their line anyway, of course, but they haven't forgiven you,

263
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,900
and they never will.

264
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,340
The Last Night comes out on PC and Xbox One in 2018.

265
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,520
Regardless of how this whole thing plays out in the future, or whether or not the original

266
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,120
theme is still in the game, I plan to play it.

267
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,640
And based on the trailers, I hope you do too.

268
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,520
And I stand with Tim Saray, whether or not he's actually changed his opinion, because

269
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,400
I believe that artists should be free to create the works of art that exists in their hearts.

270
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,600
All I ask of you, Tim, is that in making The Last Night, you be true to yourself.

271
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,160
Anyway, I can't wait for it.

272
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,720
It's gonna be awesome to attend some of these in-game parties.

273
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,560
I can't wait to grind up on some pixelated women like some misogynist pig.

274
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,420
Actually, if we're speaking of being true to myself, it would probably go something

275
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,300
more like this.
