0	17480	So, E3 has come and gone for another year.
17480	20120	That's the Electronics Entertainment Expo, by the way.
20120	24400	It's the year's largest video game trade show, where companies gather in LA to show
24400	27020	off their upcoming games and hardware for the new year.
27020	31220	My friends and I watched all the major conferences on our gaming channel, in fact, including
31220	34500	the absolute shitshow that was Devolver Digital's conference.
34500	37980	But the game that stood out the most to me was The Last Knight, and you can probably
37980	39940	see why just by looking at the trailer.
39940	44220	I know that the 2D pixel indie thing is certainly a huge trend right now, but this is different
44220	47500	than say Mega Man 9, Shovel Knight, or Stardew Valley.
47500	50940	Those were all good looking quality games in their own right, but The Last Knight, in
50940	55960	my opinion, is on another level entirely, with the amazing lighting effects, the perspective
55960	58640	and scaling, and the sheer detail of the pixel art.
58640	63080	In fact, The Last Knight ended up being one of the most talked about games of this year's
63080	67960	E3, with only the Metroid Prime 4 announcement significantly surpassing it on social media.
67960	73200	It was, by far, the most talked about indie title of the convention, but as we'll soon
73200	77480	see, not all of the social media buzz regarding The Last Knight was positive.
77480	81700	The Last Knight was a surprise out of nowhere hit during the Xbox conference.
81700	86700	This conference was unique among E3 conferences in that it had very little showmanship, with
86700	90620	the exception of a car on stage at the beginning as advertisement for a new racing title that
90620	92620	most gamers probably don't give a shit about.
92620	95740	You can generally tell when a company has very little to show at E3.
95740	99780	They'll pad the conference out with something like a sitar band playing in front of a waterfall
99780	104100	light show, or a nostalgic montage that tugs at an old gamer's heartstrings but brings
104100	105340	nothing to the table.
105340	110060	On the flip side, when a company has actual content to show, they often proudly announce
110060	113860	that they're just going to machine gun fire game trailers at the audience, and The Last
113860	118620	Knight made its first debut as one of those many bullets during the Xbox conference.
118620	122580	So right out the gate, The Last Knight was up against some pretty hefty competition,
122580	125060	and yet still managed to be the sleeper hit of the show.
125060	126900	And that got a lot of people talking.
126900	130620	As well as looking into who exactly was responsible for the game's development, which is where
130620	132580	we hit our social media snag.
132580	137460	Meet Tim Saray, one of the two Frenchman brothers who run the indie company Odd Tales, which
137460	141700	contrary to my initial knee-jerk reaction has nothing to do with the Oddworld franchise.
141700	146860	Tim Saray, years before The Last Knight's trailer took E3 by storm, made a few tweets
146860	150860	that some people might consider wrongthink, but that the rest of us just see as healthy
150860	151860	skepticism.
151860	152860	Let's look at them.
152860	156740	I'm against feminism, because it's getting more and more skewed.
156740	158620	I am for egalitarianism.
158620	161300	I don't care boy, girl, alien.
161300	166060	And feminism now forces you to think from the woman point of view, whereas egalitarianism
166060	167380	is really universal.
167380	171980	These tweets tap into the larger conversation of feminism versus egalitarianism.
171980	175420	Proponents of feminism claim that it is inherently egalitarian, because they believe that women
175420	179500	are disadvantaged, and that egalitarianism is achieved by lifting women up to the level
179500	180500	of men.
180500	184320	Strict egalitarianism proponents, meanwhile, claim that feminism's exclusive focus on
184320	188900	women is anti-egalitarian in nature, as it fails to take into account instances where
188900	193280	men may be disadvantaged, where men face problems unique to their gender that women have no
193280	197880	experience with, or where both genders face similar problems, but only women receive assistance
197880	198880	for it.
198880	201560	In essence, the argument boils down to this picture.
201560	205840	The frame on the left is equality, where each person is treated the same, regardless of
205840	209920	their individual needs, and the frame on the right shows an uneven distribution of social
209920	213840	assistance, represented by crates, according to each individual's needs.
213840	216480	The right frame does paint a compelling argument.
216480	221040	For example, of course the sick or the homeless should receive social assistance that a healthy,
221040	222740	wealthy person may not need.
222740	226140	But when this idea falls apart is when you apply it to gender.
226140	230380	Do you really believe that this taller individual is an accurate representation of men, as a
230380	231620	class of people?
231620	234700	Do you really believe that the child accurately represents women?
234700	238400	Applying this form of equity to gender simply means that the person doing the application
238400	243020	believes women are inherently weaker or inferior, and that they need society to lift them up
243020	244020	to equal standing.
244020	247940	I don't think I'm reading too much into it when I say that Tim Saray's tweets are
247940	248940	part of this argument.
248940	252180	He doesn't mention the crate metaphor, but he doesn't have to.
252180	256800	His belief in strict egalitarianism over feminism here is a stand-in for a much larger
256800	259780	conversation that won't fit into 140 characters.
259780	263820	That Tim believes that individual women can be just as strong, powerful, and capable as
263820	265100	individual men.
265100	271020	And it is vitally more important that society treat everyone equally, aka equality of opportunity,
271020	275900	rather than force equity simply for the sake of quotas and representation, aka equality
275900	276900	of outcome.
276900	280700	And this is one of the big reasons that SJWs went after him like a pack of hyenas after
280700	281700	the Xbox conference.
281700	283620	But it's not the only one.
283620	287140	People who blame art and entertainment for society's ills are always on the wrong side
287140	288140	of history.
288140	290820	Hashtag gamergate, hashtag not your shield.
290820	292180	Oh my.
292180	296540	If conservative Christians campaigning against D&D, rock and roll, and video games still
296540	299700	had any political clout, they'd be coming after you right now, Tim.
299700	302980	Oh well, I guess our friend Anita Sarkeesian will have to do.
302980	304640	She's ideologically close enough.
304640	309360	Our game The Last Knight will take place in a cyberpunk world where modern feminism won
309360	310840	instead of egalitarianism.
310840	314720	I find it interesting to show the danger of extreme progressivism in the background of
314720	316640	the game, the characters, and the story.
316640	321440	Finally, we'll have another take on cyberpunk oppression instead of Big Brother, 1984, HAL,
321440	322440	and big companies.
322440	326640	What if the surveillance, bullying, marginalization won't come from governments, but from the
326640	327640	internet?
327640	330660	That actually sounds like a really, really interesting idea for a game world.
330660	334480	Maybe not an entire game on its own, because I have a feeling that it would get way too
334480	335480	preachy.
335480	339760	If a game tries to be a critique of a specific method of constructing society, it often trips
339760	344340	over its own soapbox, the Bioshock series being a great example, but I'm still extremely
344340	347860	interested in this concept, and I hope it survives to make it into the release version
347860	349040	of The Last Knight.
349040	352840	That may be in jeopardy, however, because after the Xbox conference, Tim Sarkees got
352840	357940	absolutely dogpiled on social media for allegedly shoehorning an anti-regressive left message
357940	358940	into his game.
358940	363000	But wait, Kotaku, and other shitty regressive game journal sites, I thought it was important
363000	365540	for game devs to include politics in their games.
365540	369120	In fact, I thought it was ridiculous of Gamergate to want games to be apolitical.
369120	372560	Oh, oh, does that only apply to your politics?
372560	377680	Is it suddenly gross, or not okay, or some other bit of childish terminology, when somebody
377680	381980	takes your ideology, your pet projects, and extrapolates them into the dystopian nightmare
381980	385480	and result that they would inevitably lead us to if you and your kind ever got ahold
385480	386920	of serious institutional power?
386920	390120	I guess somebody like that absolutely would need censoring, wouldn't they?
390160	394360	The next day, PC gaming conference went live at E3, hosted by the Hearthstone streamer
394360	395360	Day9.
395360	397000	Or about two thirds of Day9.
397000	398480	Good job at losing the weight, dude.
398480	402680	When The Last Knight's PC version was scheduled to be shown, Tim Sarkees hit the stage and
402680	405800	profusely apologized for the aforementioned tweets during the height of Gamergate.
420120	422600	He also tweeted about it later, stating,
450120	453760	And I'm more interested in judging people by the ideas that they hold than the labels
453760	455080	they define themselves with.
455080	460200	I do, in fact, personally know people who are absolutely egalitarians, but call themselves
460200	461200	feminists.
461200	464000	And I've also met feminists who are more interested in female supremacy than gender
464000	465040	equality.
465040	468560	Often this comes down to a case-by-case thing, and I don't think it's inherently immoral
468560	470360	or anything to critique feminism.
470360	472760	Tim, this is not something to apologize for.
472760	473760	3.
473760	477260	The fictional setting of the game does challenge techno-social progress as a whole, but certainly
477260	479380	not trying to promote regressive ideas.
479380	482540	This honestly sounds like he's trying to do a PR spin.
482540	486260	Technosocial progress refers specifically, in this case, to automation, and the universal
486260	490460	basic income that some people believe society must adopt in order to prevent massive societal
490460	491460	collapse.
491460	492460	Know how I know this?
492460	495260	From this old description of The Last Knight that has since been pulled.
495260	498820	Humans first knew the era of survival, then they knew the era of work.
498820	500940	Now they live in the era of leisure.
500940	504540	Machines have surpassed human labor not only in strength but in precision, intellect, and
504540	505540	creativity.
505540	509560	Stabilized by universal income, people struggle to find their calling or identity, and define
509560	512500	themselves by what they consume rather than what they create.
512500	516360	The Last Knight immerses you in the everyday life of Charlie, a second-class citizen living
516360	520720	in a city brimming with augmentation and citizens living a gamified existence, none of which
520720	523500	Charlie can experience himself due to a childhood accident.
523500	527060	Apathetic and disheartened by the seemingly pointless world around him, Charlie is presented
527060	529380	an opportunity to take matters into his own hands.
529380	530880	But at what risk?
530880	534300	This does sound like a really interesting concept for a game world.
534300	538380	Assuming the real-world effects of universal basic income is well beyond the scope of this
538380	541820	video, I'm not sure it would completely destroy everyone's passions like this description
541820	545900	says it would, but I think it would absolutely do that to at least a section of the population.
545900	547460	A future video topic, maybe.
547460	550320	But as far as The Last Knight is concerned, it's a great setup.
550320	554600	Humanity wants for nothing, but in the process, has lost something core to its being.
554600	559180	It sounds like it's got people jacking themselves willing into a Matrix-style VR pleasure parlor,
559180	561380	which the hero bitterly cannot participate in.
561380	566660	It smacks of Fight Club with meaningless consumerism desperately and unsuccessfully filling an existential
566660	567660	void.
567660	569260	And of course, there's Blade Runner.
569260	570940	Lots and lots of Blade Runner.
570940	575100	If The Last Knight continues to challenge techno-social progress, as originally described
575100	578820	in the game's first background blurb, Tim Cerae's vision still may be intact in the
578820	584140	final release, regardless of the social media backlash from SJWs and the regressive left.
584140	588700	In fact, I decided to go and see what Tim's original vision for The Last Knight was for
588700	589700	myself.
589900	594420	It's not commonly known that The Last Knight was originally a Flash game made by Tim years
594420	595420	ago.
595420	599780	It's certainly cruder than its newer counterpart, but the heart and soul the game persists.
599780	604360	The original The Last Knight was envisioned as an entry to the Cyberpunk Jam, a contest
604360	609180	run by Deviever that spanned from March 1st, 2014 to March 12th, 2014.
609180	613380	In that timeframe, indie developers were invited to quickly create a game from scratch, with
613380	615700	all entries using the Cyberpunk theme.
615700	620220	The Last Knight was awarded first place in the Cyberpunk Jam, with sub-rankings of 1st
620220	625060	in Aesthetics, 4th in Synergy, 4th in Polish, and 31st in Relevance.
625060	628900	As a quick side note, those of you from the old days of Gamergate will recognize the
628900	632060	name Deviever, but really, there's not much of a story here.
632060	635220	She's also gone by Grace Lynn, PixelGoth, and a few other names.
635220	640920	She used to make guitar pedals, but sold the brand, and then maybe re-bought it back?
640920	645160	She used to be pro-GG, and then was anti, and then was pro again.
645160	649480	She started Patreons and Kickstarters galore, and played both sides for a few small sums
649480	650480	of money.
650480	654480	She used to be involved in real life with Chobitcoin and Battlefield Trip, two other
654480	659160	gamergate flip floppers who used the hashtag to raise money for unrelated shit, like dental
659160	660160	surgery.
660160	663660	Honestly, I think the whole thing is just personal drama, with their entire crowd being
663660	666140	made up of a bunch of cancerous fraudsters.
666140	668120	She even stole a shoe on heads trademark choker.
668120	670120	But in the end, there's nothing here.
670120	674140	No corruption or collusion, just a familiar name that brought back a few memories.
674140	677840	As for The Last Knight's original Flash incarnation, it's very simplistic, but you
677840	681920	can absolutely see the original ideas of Tim and Adrian Saray begin to take shape.
681920	685920	In just two short minutes of gameplay, The Last Knight conveys the idea of living as
685920	690900	a permanent outsider in a decadent futuristic culture, surrounded by constant surveillance.
690900	694120	It almost feels like a very primitive Deus Ex in its theming.
694120	699120	But is it a generic anti-big government or anti-big corporation cyberpunk dystopia, like
699120	700680	most others of the genre?
700680	705280	Or does the very specific World War Xtreme Progressivism I idea shine through?
705280	706860	It's hard to say either way.
706860	709240	There's just not enough to go on in the Flash version.
709240	711320	But nonetheless, it's very well done.
711320	716560	In the end, I have no problem with stating unequivocally that Tim Saray did nothing wrong.
716560	721000	Maybe he's legitimately changed his views between 2014 and now, and no longer wants
721000	723680	to make an anti-radical leftist cyberpunk game.
723680	725840	If so, that's entirely fine with me.
725840	729600	I'll still play and probably enjoy The Last Knight, but I find it more likely that he's
729600	734480	been browbeaten and censored by the very vocal minority of GamesPress and Twitter SJWs
734480	738480	into either giving lip service to the ideas that The Last Knight is critiquing, or removing
738480	739840	the critique from the game entirely.
739840	743600	And if that's the case, Tim, I'll say to you what I said to many other small indie
743600	745660	devs back during Gamergate's height.
745660	747820	You don't need to rely on them.
747820	751340	The shitty journos, the regressive SJW devs with their connections.
751340	752340	The clique.
752340	754380	The clique does not have to be your audience.
754380	755840	The clique is over.
755840	757800	Look at the hype your game has garnered.
757800	761400	You went from winning a game jam nobody had ever heard of, to hitting the stage of two
761400	763760	E3 conferences this past year.
763760	766060	People are talking about your game all over the internet.
766060	769340	And despite what's bubbled to the top of your feed, it's been mostly positive.
769340	773120	YouTubers will be lining up to do reviews and day one let's plays of The Last Knight,
773120	774120	myself included.
774120	777920	It's only a small vocal minority that actually cares about this shit that's been slung
777920	779000	at you.
779000	783400	And they really are very, very small, with only a tiny amount of influence that continues
783400	785320	to wane day by day.
785320	786880	You want proof of this?
786880	791400	The On Good and Evil 2 announcement trailer was great in many ways, but when they mentioned
791400	795320	diversity it was only a small crowd at the back of the auditorium that gave the tiniest
795320	818800	chirping of a cheer.
818800	833720	That's not because everybody else in attendance was against diversity or something.
833720	837680	It's because everybody else knows that diversity in video games, or more broadly diversity
837680	843040	in sci-fi, has been a non-issue ever since Kirk Kistuhura back in 1968.
843040	844960	It's been a non-issue elsewhere as well.
844960	850280	It is completely disingenuous for young feminists to let out a long sigh and a FINALLY at the
850280	854240	new Wonder Woman movie when film is filled with strong, principled female leads.
854240	856680	And the same goes with the animation scene as well.
856680	860780	Japan, of all places, has seen to it that women take the center stage as heroines, protectors
860780	863520	and dispensers of justice for an extremely long time now.
863520	867520	What I'm saying, Tim, is that if you haven't changed, and you still hold the view as you
867520	870620	used to, you do not need to bend the knee to these people.
870620	872040	They hold no power over you.
872120	876160	Don't let them beat your artistic vision into submission with their baseless threats.
876160	878200	Your audience will play your game regardless.
878200	880720	YouTubers and streamers will promote it regardless.
880720	885340	And honestly, even with your apology, these dying outlets with their dead inside supporters
885340	887100	will likely slander you anyway.
887100	890560	In my opinion, that's the biggest difference between those who supported Gamergate, or the
890560	894360	skeptic community or whatever you want to call them, and the SJW crowd.
894360	897220	We generally have a capacity to forgive that they lack.
897220	900980	When Ian Miles-Chiang apologized, and worked extremely hard to rebuild his reputation and
900980	904140	brand among gamers, we accepted him back into the fold.
904140	908400	When Laci Green decided to simply hold a dialogue with us, not even change her position, just
908400	912820	speak to us, we accepted her, and her former supporters burnt her at the stake.
912820	914780	And this is already happening to you, Tim.
914780	917060	You've apologized, and they haven't forgiven you.
917060	920900	They expect you to toe their line anyway, of course, but they haven't forgiven you,
920900	921900	and they never will.
921900	925340	The Last Night comes out on PC and Xbox One in 2018.
925340	928520	Regardless of how this whole thing plays out in the future, or whether or not the original
928520	931120	theme is still in the game, I plan to play it.
931120	933640	And based on the trailers, I hope you do too.
933640	937520	And I stand with Tim Saray, whether or not he's actually changed his opinion, because
937520	941400	I believe that artists should be free to create the works of art that exists in their hearts.
941400	945600	All I ask of you, Tim, is that in making The Last Night, you be true to yourself.
945600	947160	Anyway, I can't wait for it.
947160	949720	It's gonna be awesome to attend some of these in-game parties.
949720	953560	I can't wait to grind up on some pixelated women like some misogynist pig.
953560	957420	Actually, if we're speaking of being true to myself, it would probably go something
957420	958300	more like this.
