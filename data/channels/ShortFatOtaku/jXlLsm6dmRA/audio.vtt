00:00.000 --> 00:17.480
So, E3 has come and gone for another year.

00:17.480 --> 00:20.120
That's the Electronics Entertainment Expo, by the way.

00:20.120 --> 00:24.400
It's the year's largest video game trade show, where companies gather in LA to show

00:24.400 --> 00:27.020
off their upcoming games and hardware for the new year.

00:27.020 --> 00:31.220
My friends and I watched all the major conferences on our gaming channel, in fact, including

00:31.220 --> 00:34.500
the absolute shitshow that was Devolver Digital's conference.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.980
But the game that stood out the most to me was The Last Knight, and you can probably

00:37.980 --> 00:39.940
see why just by looking at the trailer.

00:39.940 --> 00:44.220
I know that the 2D pixel indie thing is certainly a huge trend right now, but this is different

00:44.220 --> 00:47.500
than say Mega Man 9, Shovel Knight, or Stardew Valley.

00:47.500 --> 00:50.940
Those were all good looking quality games in their own right, but The Last Knight, in

00:50.940 --> 00:55.960
my opinion, is on another level entirely, with the amazing lighting effects, the perspective

00:55.960 --> 00:58.640
and scaling, and the sheer detail of the pixel art.

00:58.640 --> 01:03.080
In fact, The Last Knight ended up being one of the most talked about games of this year's

01:03.080 --> 01:07.960
E3, with only the Metroid Prime 4 announcement significantly surpassing it on social media.

01:07.960 --> 01:13.200
It was, by far, the most talked about indie title of the convention, but as we'll soon

01:13.200 --> 01:17.480
see, not all of the social media buzz regarding The Last Knight was positive.

01:17.480 --> 01:21.700
The Last Knight was a surprise out of nowhere hit during the Xbox conference.

01:21.700 --> 01:26.700
This conference was unique among E3 conferences in that it had very little showmanship, with

01:26.700 --> 01:30.620
the exception of a car on stage at the beginning as advertisement for a new racing title that

01:30.620 --> 01:32.620
most gamers probably don't give a shit about.

01:32.620 --> 01:35.740
You can generally tell when a company has very little to show at E3.

01:35.740 --> 01:39.780
They'll pad the conference out with something like a sitar band playing in front of a waterfall

01:39.780 --> 01:44.100
light show, or a nostalgic montage that tugs at an old gamer's heartstrings but brings

01:44.100 --> 01:45.340
nothing to the table.

01:45.340 --> 01:50.060
On the flip side, when a company has actual content to show, they often proudly announce

01:50.060 --> 01:53.860
that they're just going to machine gun fire game trailers at the audience, and The Last

01:53.860 --> 01:58.620
Knight made its first debut as one of those many bullets during the Xbox conference.

01:58.620 --> 02:02.580
So right out the gate, The Last Knight was up against some pretty hefty competition,

02:02.580 --> 02:05.060
and yet still managed to be the sleeper hit of the show.

02:05.060 --> 02:06.900
And that got a lot of people talking.

02:06.900 --> 02:10.620
As well as looking into who exactly was responsible for the game's development, which is where

02:10.620 --> 02:12.580
we hit our social media snag.

02:12.580 --> 02:17.460
Meet Tim Saray, one of the two Frenchman brothers who run the indie company Odd Tales, which

02:17.460 --> 02:21.700
contrary to my initial knee-jerk reaction has nothing to do with the Oddworld franchise.

02:21.700 --> 02:26.860
Tim Saray, years before The Last Knight's trailer took E3 by storm, made a few tweets

02:26.860 --> 02:30.860
that some people might consider wrongthink, but that the rest of us just see as healthy

02:30.860 --> 02:31.860
skepticism.

02:31.860 --> 02:32.860
Let's look at them.

02:32.860 --> 02:36.740
I'm against feminism, because it's getting more and more skewed.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.620
I am for egalitarianism.

02:38.620 --> 02:41.300
I don't care boy, girl, alien.

02:41.300 --> 02:46.060
And feminism now forces you to think from the woman point of view, whereas egalitarianism

02:46.060 --> 02:47.380
is really universal.

02:47.380 --> 02:51.980
These tweets tap into the larger conversation of feminism versus egalitarianism.

02:51.980 --> 02:55.420
Proponents of feminism claim that it is inherently egalitarian, because they believe that women

02:55.420 --> 02:59.500
are disadvantaged, and that egalitarianism is achieved by lifting women up to the level

02:59.500 --> 03:00.500
of men.

03:00.500 --> 03:04.320
Strict egalitarianism proponents, meanwhile, claim that feminism's exclusive focus on

03:04.320 --> 03:08.900
women is anti-egalitarian in nature, as it fails to take into account instances where

03:08.900 --> 03:13.280
men may be disadvantaged, where men face problems unique to their gender that women have no

03:13.280 --> 03:17.880
experience with, or where both genders face similar problems, but only women receive assistance

03:17.880 --> 03:18.880
for it.

03:18.880 --> 03:21.560
In essence, the argument boils down to this picture.

03:21.560 --> 03:25.840
The frame on the left is equality, where each person is treated the same, regardless of

03:25.840 --> 03:29.920
their individual needs, and the frame on the right shows an uneven distribution of social

03:29.920 --> 03:33.840
assistance, represented by crates, according to each individual's needs.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.480
The right frame does paint a compelling argument.

03:36.480 --> 03:41.040
For example, of course the sick or the homeless should receive social assistance that a healthy,

03:41.040 --> 03:42.740
wealthy person may not need.

03:42.740 --> 03:46.140
But when this idea falls apart is when you apply it to gender.

03:46.140 --> 03:50.380
Do you really believe that this taller individual is an accurate representation of men, as a

03:50.380 --> 03:51.620
class of people?

03:51.620 --> 03:54.700
Do you really believe that the child accurately represents women?

03:54.700 --> 03:58.400
Applying this form of equity to gender simply means that the person doing the application

03:58.400 --> 04:03.020
believes women are inherently weaker or inferior, and that they need society to lift them up

04:03.020 --> 04:04.020
to equal standing.

04:04.020 --> 04:07.940
I don't think I'm reading too much into it when I say that Tim Saray's tweets are

04:07.940 --> 04:08.940
part of this argument.

04:08.940 --> 04:12.180
He doesn't mention the crate metaphor, but he doesn't have to.

04:12.180 --> 04:16.800
His belief in strict egalitarianism over feminism here is a stand-in for a much larger

04:16.800 --> 04:19.780
conversation that won't fit into 140 characters.

04:19.780 --> 04:23.820
That Tim believes that individual women can be just as strong, powerful, and capable as

04:23.820 --> 04:25.100
individual men.

04:25.100 --> 04:31.020
And it is vitally more important that society treat everyone equally, aka equality of opportunity,

04:31.020 --> 04:35.900
rather than force equity simply for the sake of quotas and representation, aka equality

04:35.900 --> 04:36.900
of outcome.

04:36.900 --> 04:40.700
And this is one of the big reasons that SJWs went after him like a pack of hyenas after

04:40.700 --> 04:41.700
the Xbox conference.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.620
But it's not the only one.

04:43.620 --> 04:47.140
People who blame art and entertainment for society's ills are always on the wrong side

04:47.140 --> 04:48.140
of history.

04:48.140 --> 04:50.820
Hashtag gamergate, hashtag not your shield.

04:50.820 --> 04:52.180
Oh my.

04:52.180 --> 04:56.540
If conservative Christians campaigning against D&D, rock and roll, and video games still

04:56.540 --> 04:59.700
had any political clout, they'd be coming after you right now, Tim.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.980
Oh well, I guess our friend Anita Sarkeesian will have to do.

05:02.980 --> 05:04.640
She's ideologically close enough.

05:04.640 --> 05:09.360
Our game The Last Knight will take place in a cyberpunk world where modern feminism won

05:09.360 --> 05:10.840
instead of egalitarianism.

05:10.840 --> 05:14.720
I find it interesting to show the danger of extreme progressivism in the background of

05:14.720 --> 05:16.640
the game, the characters, and the story.

05:16.640 --> 05:21.440
Finally, we'll have another take on cyberpunk oppression instead of Big Brother, 1984, HAL,

05:21.440 --> 05:22.440
and big companies.

05:22.440 --> 05:26.640
What if the surveillance, bullying, marginalization won't come from governments, but from the

05:26.640 --> 05:27.640
internet?

05:27.640 --> 05:30.660
That actually sounds like a really, really interesting idea for a game world.

05:30.660 --> 05:34.480
Maybe not an entire game on its own, because I have a feeling that it would get way too

05:34.480 --> 05:35.480
preachy.

05:35.480 --> 05:39.760
If a game tries to be a critique of a specific method of constructing society, it often trips

05:39.760 --> 05:44.340
over its own soapbox, the Bioshock series being a great example, but I'm still extremely

05:44.340 --> 05:47.860
interested in this concept, and I hope it survives to make it into the release version

05:47.860 --> 05:49.040
of The Last Knight.

05:49.040 --> 05:52.840
That may be in jeopardy, however, because after the Xbox conference, Tim Sarkees got

05:52.840 --> 05:57.940
absolutely dogpiled on social media for allegedly shoehorning an anti-regressive left message

05:57.940 --> 05:58.940
into his game.

05:58.940 --> 06:03.000
But wait, Kotaku, and other shitty regressive game journal sites, I thought it was important

06:03.000 --> 06:05.540
for game devs to include politics in their games.

06:05.540 --> 06:09.120
In fact, I thought it was ridiculous of Gamergate to want games to be apolitical.

06:09.120 --> 06:12.560
Oh, oh, does that only apply to your politics?

06:12.560 --> 06:17.680
Is it suddenly gross, or not okay, or some other bit of childish terminology, when somebody

06:17.680 --> 06:21.980
takes your ideology, your pet projects, and extrapolates them into the dystopian nightmare

06:21.980 --> 06:25.480
and result that they would inevitably lead us to if you and your kind ever got ahold

06:25.480 --> 06:26.920
of serious institutional power?

06:26.920 --> 06:30.120
I guess somebody like that absolutely would need censoring, wouldn't they?

06:30.160 --> 06:34.360
The next day, PC gaming conference went live at E3, hosted by the Hearthstone streamer

06:34.360 --> 06:35.360
Day9.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.000
Or about two thirds of Day9.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.480
Good job at losing the weight, dude.

06:38.480 --> 06:42.680
When The Last Knight's PC version was scheduled to be shown, Tim Sarkees hit the stage and

06:42.680 --> 06:45.800
profusely apologized for the aforementioned tweets during the height of Gamergate.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.600
He also tweeted about it later, stating,

07:30.120 --> 07:33.760
And I'm more interested in judging people by the ideas that they hold than the labels

07:33.760 --> 07:35.080
they define themselves with.

07:35.080 --> 07:40.200
I do, in fact, personally know people who are absolutely egalitarians, but call themselves

07:40.200 --> 07:41.200
feminists.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.000
And I've also met feminists who are more interested in female supremacy than gender

07:44.000 --> 07:45.040
equality.

07:45.040 --> 07:48.560
Often this comes down to a case-by-case thing, and I don't think it's inherently immoral

07:48.560 --> 07:50.360
or anything to critique feminism.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.760
Tim, this is not something to apologize for.

07:52.760 --> 07:53.760
3.

07:53.760 --> 07:57.260
The fictional setting of the game does challenge techno-social progress as a whole, but certainly

07:57.260 --> 07:59.380
not trying to promote regressive ideas.

07:59.380 --> 08:02.540
This honestly sounds like he's trying to do a PR spin.

08:02.540 --> 08:06.260
Technosocial progress refers specifically, in this case, to automation, and the universal

08:06.260 --> 08:10.460
basic income that some people believe society must adopt in order to prevent massive societal

08:10.460 --> 08:11.460
collapse.

08:11.460 --> 08:12.460
Know how I know this?

08:12.460 --> 08:15.260
From this old description of The Last Knight that has since been pulled.

08:15.260 --> 08:18.820
Humans first knew the era of survival, then they knew the era of work.

08:18.820 --> 08:20.940
Now they live in the era of leisure.

08:20.940 --> 08:24.540
Machines have surpassed human labor not only in strength but in precision, intellect, and

08:24.540 --> 08:25.540
creativity.

08:25.540 --> 08:29.560
Stabilized by universal income, people struggle to find their calling or identity, and define

08:29.560 --> 08:32.500
themselves by what they consume rather than what they create.

08:32.500 --> 08:36.360
The Last Knight immerses you in the everyday life of Charlie, a second-class citizen living

08:36.360 --> 08:40.720
in a city brimming with augmentation and citizens living a gamified existence, none of which

08:40.720 --> 08:43.500
Charlie can experience himself due to a childhood accident.

08:43.500 --> 08:47.060
Apathetic and disheartened by the seemingly pointless world around him, Charlie is presented

08:47.060 --> 08:49.380
an opportunity to take matters into his own hands.

08:49.380 --> 08:50.880
But at what risk?

08:50.880 --> 08:54.300
This does sound like a really interesting concept for a game world.

08:54.300 --> 08:58.380
Assuming the real-world effects of universal basic income is well beyond the scope of this

08:58.380 --> 09:01.820
video, I'm not sure it would completely destroy everyone's passions like this description

09:01.820 --> 09:05.900
says it would, but I think it would absolutely do that to at least a section of the population.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.460
A future video topic, maybe.

09:07.460 --> 09:10.320
But as far as The Last Knight is concerned, it's a great setup.

09:10.320 --> 09:14.600
Humanity wants for nothing, but in the process, has lost something core to its being.

09:14.600 --> 09:19.180
It sounds like it's got people jacking themselves willing into a Matrix-style VR pleasure parlor,

09:19.180 --> 09:21.380
which the hero bitterly cannot participate in.

09:21.380 --> 09:26.660
It smacks of Fight Club with meaningless consumerism desperately and unsuccessfully filling an existential

09:26.660 --> 09:27.660
void.

09:27.660 --> 09:29.260
And of course, there's Blade Runner.

09:29.260 --> 09:30.940
Lots and lots of Blade Runner.

09:30.940 --> 09:35.100
If The Last Knight continues to challenge techno-social progress, as originally described

09:35.100 --> 09:38.820
in the game's first background blurb, Tim Cerae's vision still may be intact in the

09:38.820 --> 09:44.140
final release, regardless of the social media backlash from SJWs and the regressive left.

09:44.140 --> 09:48.700
In fact, I decided to go and see what Tim's original vision for The Last Knight was for

09:48.700 --> 09:49.700
myself.

09:49.900 --> 09:54.420
It's not commonly known that The Last Knight was originally a Flash game made by Tim years

09:54.420 --> 09:55.420
ago.

09:55.420 --> 09:59.780
It's certainly cruder than its newer counterpart, but the heart and soul the game persists.

09:59.780 --> 10:04.360
The original The Last Knight was envisioned as an entry to the Cyberpunk Jam, a contest

10:04.360 --> 10:09.180
run by Deviever that spanned from March 1st, 2014 to March 12th, 2014.

10:09.180 --> 10:13.380
In that timeframe, indie developers were invited to quickly create a game from scratch, with

10:13.380 --> 10:15.700
all entries using the Cyberpunk theme.

10:15.700 --> 10:20.220
The Last Knight was awarded first place in the Cyberpunk Jam, with sub-rankings of 1st

10:20.220 --> 10:25.060
in Aesthetics, 4th in Synergy, 4th in Polish, and 31st in Relevance.

10:25.060 --> 10:28.900
As a quick side note, those of you from the old days of Gamergate will recognize the

10:28.900 --> 10:32.060
name Deviever, but really, there's not much of a story here.

10:32.060 --> 10:35.220
She's also gone by Grace Lynn, PixelGoth, and a few other names.

10:35.220 --> 10:40.920
She used to make guitar pedals, but sold the brand, and then maybe re-bought it back?

10:40.920 --> 10:45.160
She used to be pro-GG, and then was anti, and then was pro again.

10:45.160 --> 10:49.480
She started Patreons and Kickstarters galore, and played both sides for a few small sums

10:49.480 --> 10:50.480
of money.

10:50.480 --> 10:54.480
She used to be involved in real life with Chobitcoin and Battlefield Trip, two other

10:54.480 --> 10:59.160
gamergate flip floppers who used the hashtag to raise money for unrelated shit, like dental

10:59.160 --> 11:00.160
surgery.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.660
Honestly, I think the whole thing is just personal drama, with their entire crowd being

11:03.660 --> 11:06.140
made up of a bunch of cancerous fraudsters.

11:06.140 --> 11:08.120
She even stole a shoe on heads trademark choker.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.120
But in the end, there's nothing here.

11:10.120 --> 11:14.140
No corruption or collusion, just a familiar name that brought back a few memories.

11:14.140 --> 11:17.840
As for The Last Knight's original Flash incarnation, it's very simplistic, but you

11:17.840 --> 11:21.920
can absolutely see the original ideas of Tim and Adrian Saray begin to take shape.

11:21.920 --> 11:25.920
In just two short minutes of gameplay, The Last Knight conveys the idea of living as

11:25.920 --> 11:30.900
a permanent outsider in a decadent futuristic culture, surrounded by constant surveillance.

11:30.900 --> 11:34.120
It almost feels like a very primitive Deus Ex in its theming.

11:34.120 --> 11:39.120
But is it a generic anti-big government or anti-big corporation cyberpunk dystopia, like

11:39.120 --> 11:40.680
most others of the genre?

11:40.680 --> 11:45.280
Or does the very specific World War Xtreme Progressivism I idea shine through?

11:45.280 --> 11:46.860
It's hard to say either way.

11:46.860 --> 11:49.240
There's just not enough to go on in the Flash version.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.320
But nonetheless, it's very well done.

11:51.320 --> 11:56.560
In the end, I have no problem with stating unequivocally that Tim Saray did nothing wrong.

11:56.560 --> 12:01.000
Maybe he's legitimately changed his views between 2014 and now, and no longer wants

12:01.000 --> 12:03.680
to make an anti-radical leftist cyberpunk game.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.840
If so, that's entirely fine with me.

12:05.840 --> 12:09.600
I'll still play and probably enjoy The Last Knight, but I find it more likely that he's

12:09.600 --> 12:14.480
been browbeaten and censored by the very vocal minority of GamesPress and Twitter SJWs

12:14.480 --> 12:18.480
into either giving lip service to the ideas that The Last Knight is critiquing, or removing

12:18.480 --> 12:19.840
the critique from the game entirely.

12:19.840 --> 12:23.600
And if that's the case, Tim, I'll say to you what I said to many other small indie

12:23.600 --> 12:25.660
devs back during Gamergate's height.

12:25.660 --> 12:27.820
You don't need to rely on them.

12:27.820 --> 12:31.340
The shitty journos, the regressive SJW devs with their connections.

12:31.340 --> 12:32.340
The clique.

12:32.340 --> 12:34.380
The clique does not have to be your audience.

12:34.380 --> 12:35.840
The clique is over.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.800
Look at the hype your game has garnered.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.400
You went from winning a game jam nobody had ever heard of, to hitting the stage of two

12:41.400 --> 12:43.760
E3 conferences this past year.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.060
People are talking about your game all over the internet.

12:46.060 --> 12:49.340
And despite what's bubbled to the top of your feed, it's been mostly positive.

12:49.340 --> 12:53.120
YouTubers will be lining up to do reviews and day one let's plays of The Last Knight,

12:53.120 --> 12:54.120
myself included.

12:54.120 --> 12:57.920
It's only a small vocal minority that actually cares about this shit that's been slung

12:57.920 --> 12:59.000
at you.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.400
And they really are very, very small, with only a tiny amount of influence that continues

13:03.400 --> 13:05.320
to wane day by day.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.880
You want proof of this?

13:06.880 --> 13:11.400
The On Good and Evil 2 announcement trailer was great in many ways, but when they mentioned

13:11.400 --> 13:15.320
diversity it was only a small crowd at the back of the auditorium that gave the tiniest

13:15.320 --> 13:38.800
chirping of a cheer.

13:38.800 --> 13:53.720
That's not because everybody else in attendance was against diversity or something.

13:53.720 --> 13:57.680
It's because everybody else knows that diversity in video games, or more broadly diversity

13:57.680 --> 14:03.040
in sci-fi, has been a non-issue ever since Kirk Kistuhura back in 1968.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.960
It's been a non-issue elsewhere as well.

14:04.960 --> 14:10.280
It is completely disingenuous for young feminists to let out a long sigh and a FINALLY at the

14:10.280 --> 14:14.240
new Wonder Woman movie when film is filled with strong, principled female leads.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.680
And the same goes with the animation scene as well.

14:16.680 --> 14:20.780
Japan, of all places, has seen to it that women take the center stage as heroines, protectors

14:20.780 --> 14:23.520
and dispensers of justice for an extremely long time now.

14:23.520 --> 14:27.520
What I'm saying, Tim, is that if you haven't changed, and you still hold the view as you

14:27.520 --> 14:30.620
used to, you do not need to bend the knee to these people.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.040
They hold no power over you.

14:32.120 --> 14:36.160
Don't let them beat your artistic vision into submission with their baseless threats.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.200
Your audience will play your game regardless.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.720
YouTubers and streamers will promote it regardless.

14:40.720 --> 14:45.340
And honestly, even with your apology, these dying outlets with their dead inside supporters

14:45.340 --> 14:47.100
will likely slander you anyway.

14:47.100 --> 14:50.560
In my opinion, that's the biggest difference between those who supported Gamergate, or the

14:50.560 --> 14:54.360
skeptic community or whatever you want to call them, and the SJW crowd.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.220
We generally have a capacity to forgive that they lack.

14:57.220 --> 15:00.980
When Ian Miles-Chiang apologized, and worked extremely hard to rebuild his reputation and

15:00.980 --> 15:04.140
brand among gamers, we accepted him back into the fold.

15:04.140 --> 15:08.400
When Laci Green decided to simply hold a dialogue with us, not even change her position, just

15:08.400 --> 15:12.820
speak to us, we accepted her, and her former supporters burnt her at the stake.

15:12.820 --> 15:14.780
And this is already happening to you, Tim.

15:14.780 --> 15:17.060
You've apologized, and they haven't forgiven you.

15:17.060 --> 15:20.900
They expect you to toe their line anyway, of course, but they haven't forgiven you,

15:20.900 --> 15:21.900
and they never will.

15:21.900 --> 15:25.340
The Last Night comes out on PC and Xbox One in 2018.

15:25.340 --> 15:28.520
Regardless of how this whole thing plays out in the future, or whether or not the original

15:28.520 --> 15:31.120
theme is still in the game, I plan to play it.

15:31.120 --> 15:33.640
And based on the trailers, I hope you do too.

15:33.640 --> 15:37.520
And I stand with Tim Saray, whether or not he's actually changed his opinion, because

15:37.520 --> 15:41.400
I believe that artists should be free to create the works of art that exists in their hearts.

15:41.400 --> 15:45.600
All I ask of you, Tim, is that in making The Last Night, you be true to yourself.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.160
Anyway, I can't wait for it.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.720
It's gonna be awesome to attend some of these in-game parties.

15:49.720 --> 15:53.560
I can't wait to grind up on some pixelated women like some misogynist pig.

15:53.560 --> 15:57.420
Actually, if we're speaking of being true to myself, it would probably go something

15:57.420 --> 15:58.300
more like this.
