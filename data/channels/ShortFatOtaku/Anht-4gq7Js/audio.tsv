0	8160	Jordan Peterson is a Nazi
8160	12960	Of course, this is something that we've heard for years now. Ever since Jordan Peterson's
12960	18560	psychology lectures started getting a whole bunch of views online back in I think 2014 or 2015,
18560	23280	and he started to become known for being a self-help guy, and regardless of what you
23280	29280	think of his takes on philosophy or religion, his self-help advice generally does seem to work.
29520	34560	But politically, he represents a fundamentally liberal point of view, which got him into some
34560	39440	trouble when he spoke out against the compelled speech legislation happening in Canada at the
39440	45760	time. So the left calls him a fascist, not because he actually is a fascist, but because the left is
45760	50960	so far off the political spectrum that liberals and fascists look to be the exact same thing.
50960	56160	So this happened a couple days ago, where Jordan Peterson says,
56160	63360	what the hell, to a segment of a Captain America comic where Red Skull is portrayed as a YouTuber
64960	73520	and... I can't believe we're talking about this, this is ridiculous. Red Skull is a YouTuber who's
73520	79440	currently, you know, speaking, and it seems quite angrily speaking at the viewer, in a video called
79440	85440	10 Rules for Life. The linked videos on the side are Chaos and Order, Carl Luger's Genius,
85440	90480	and the Feminist Trap. It's not exactly subtle, Jordan Peterson's book is 12 Rules for Life and
90480	94880	Antidote to Chaos, and his second book is 12 More Rules for Life Beyond Order. For those of you who
94880	100080	don't know about the Captain America lore, Hydra was founded as a component of the Nazi war machine
100080	104160	and Red Skull is a German. It later broke off to be its own thing in future stories after the Second
104160	107440	World War, but it definitely has a fascist component. So let me get this straight, let me
107440	113600	get this straight, Marvel, you're saying that Jordan Peterson, a psychologist, somebody who is
113600	119760	by modern political sensibilities a very generic conservative, somebody who writes positive
119760	125520	messages for men because he believes, in my opinion rightly so at least to some extent,
125520	130560	that there is not enough, I don't know, positive energy going towards men right now. There's a lot
130560	134480	of focus on toxic masculinity, and let's be honest here guys, you can't really argue with the
134480	139360	existence of toxic masculinity. The wife beater, the tyrannical father, the rapist, the corrupt
139360	145520	king, these are all parts of masculinity that are indeed toxic, but there is obviously a positive,
145520	151360	non-toxic, wholesome, flourishing masculinity as well, and the problem of toxic masculinity is not
151360	157040	solved by becoming feminine, but it is by becoming positively masculine. But anyway, Marvel is
157040	163360	comparing Red Skull, the Nazi, to Jordan Peterson, the honestly very mild-mannered person. Here's the
163360	168000	full page, Captain America says, let me guess, your brother, he disappears into the internet,
168000	172080	and when he comes back out, he can't stop talking about his new theory of the world,
172080	177440	and that theory comes from one man, Jordan Red Skull Peterson. It's the same for all of them,
177440	183760	young men, weak, looking for purpose, I found the flag, you found the badge, they found the skull.
183760	188160	He tells them what they've always longed to hear, that they're secretly great, that the whole world
188160	192560	is against them, that if they're truly men they'll fight back, and bingo, that's their purpose,
192560	196960	that's what they live for, and that's what they die for. This page is only presenting Red Skull's
196960	203120	position without actually refuting it, because the honest truth is, if you remove all of the
203120	209040	avenues for a person to actually, you know, find purpose, find meaning in their lives,
209040	212960	they are going to gravitate towards something that's destructive. That seems obvious, right?
212960	219040	Like, if there's no longer any virtue in being a good worker, or being a good entrepreneur,
219040	223520	or being a good inventor, or being a good father, then why would men play your game?
223520	228560	Why wouldn't they just say, fuck you, I'll do whatever I want? If society is failing men,
228560	232880	then you cannot blame them when they decide to shift their interest to something that they feel
232880	237600	does not fail them. Jordan Peterson's message is largely positive, but this comic says that instead
237600	242640	of Jordan Peterson, these people are going towards the Red Skull. So let's listen to the Red Skull's
242640	247520	message. What has happened to the men of the world is truly one of the great tragedies of our time.
247520	252800	Once the American man was a conqueror, now he is but a caretaker. And a caretaker of what? He
252800	257600	stands for some amorphous dream, a dream of nothing. But what I offer you is more than just
257600	262640	some petty dream, more than a life of tending the hearth. No more shall women be summoned to
262640	267920	fight your battles. I offer steel for your spine and iron for your gut. I offer you the
267920	275040	sword of manhood. Worst part about it is, um, that's actually not all that objectionable to
275600	279280	somebody who's not an insane fucking radical. Like, let's go over it, okay?
279840	284400	Once the American man was a conqueror, now he's a caretaker. You could see some negativity in that.
284400	289680	I understand, you know, being a conqueror is, there's glory in it, but it's also not necessarily
289680	293520	good, especially for the conquered peoples. And clearly we do not really live in an age where
293520	298000	colonization is considered acceptable anymore because liberalism has progressed our morals to
298000	302960	that point. So I understand his position. A caretaker of what? He stands for some amorphous
302960	308880	dream, a dream of nothing. I mean, yeah, when you take away every positive thing that people have
308880	313040	about themselves, what do you expect happens? What I offer you is more than just some petty
313040	317840	dream, more than a life of tending the hearth. No more shall women be summoned to fight your battles.
317840	323360	I think this would resonate with people just because there is, you know, a psychological
323360	328080	need to go on an adventure, to do something new. Not everything has to be an adventure,
328080	332080	but there is definitely a call to adventure. That's the whole point of the hero's journey
332080	336240	and storytelling. And also I've noticed when it comes to the creative spaces,
336640	341520	progressives absolutely hate the hero's journey. There is a hatred of heroism on the left because
341520	346720	fascists legitimately do glorify heroism, but so do liberals and they can't tell the difference.
346720	351840	I offer steel for your spine and iron for your gut. I offer you the sword of manhood. Again,
351840	357280	a positive vision of masculinity is absolutely required and steel for your spine and iron for
357280	361840	your gut. You know, that's, that's not negative actually. It's that's actually straight up
361840	364560	positive. Sometimes you need to be stoic. Sometimes you need to do what has to be done.
364560	368880	And sometimes that steel means that you must object to what you are being told to do because
368880	373360	you know, it's wrong. This entire speech is presented such that the reader should view it
373360	379040	to be negative because it is a critique of power, but power itself is not the problem. In a liberal
379040	384240	meritocratic system, competence is the virtue. Power is what you get as a by-product of that.
384240	388160	But the socialist position does not actually think that deep. They don't view competence.
388160	392720	And when they do, they don't accept it. They think it's false. So to them, it's only power.
392720	396400	Of course, Jordan Peterson, being a boomer, let's be honest here, guys. He's a little bit
396400	401040	disconnected. He has to ask, do I really live in a universe where Ta-Nehisi Coates,
401040	405280	is it Coates? I don't know how to pronounce this. This guy's name has written a captain America
405280	411360	comic featuring a parody of my ideas as a part of the philosophy of the arch villain red skull.
411360	417680	Oh, look, Anthony Fantano. Look at that shoe. It fits. I didn't even know about Anthony Fantano
417680	422800	until doing research for this video. But apparently back in 2017, he made like
422800	428480	edgelord anti SJW content. And presumably because he's a fucking coward, he cucked
428480	434080	out and became a socialist. Yeah. And when Anthony Fantano was asked about Jordan Peterson
434080	438720	actually being a Nazi, he links a talk between Peterson and Stefan Molyneux saying that he's
438720	443840	talking to a fascist. I don't think Stefan Molyneux is a fascist. Isn't he just like an
443840	448640	end cap or something? Also, I guess talking with a fascist now makes you a fascist in support of
448640	455280	baseless race and IQ science. Hold on, hold on. You do know that you learn in first year
455280	460560	university level psychology that IQ is the strongest research that has ever come out
460560	466480	of any of the social sciences. Anthony, do you consider reality itself to be fascist?
466480	473600	Also at this point, I have to point out this idea that Nazis are somehow obsessed with IQ science
473600	478400	is a complete falsehood. Contradicting common beliefs, national socialists were opposed to
478400	484560	intelligence research. In their view, intelligence research would represent a supremacy of bourgeoisie
484560	490640	spirit. Intelligence measurement would be an instrument of the jury to fortify its hegemony.
490640	495920	Selection in schools, according to intelligence, would stand for a system of examination of Jewish
495920	501760	origin, especially the concept of intelligence as a one dimensional dimension and one common
501760	505840	central factor. Because people differ and therefore intelligence differs, they called
505840	510640	for an intelligence measurement according to a national and typological point of view.
510640	516880	For Germans, they asked for a measurement of realism. They were opposed to a measurement
516880	522000	solely of theoretical intelligence, a measurement of intellectualism. Instead, they favored what
522000	526000	they called practical intelligence. Nazi researchers were opposed to the scientific
526000	531120	methods of correlation and factor analysis and believed that general intelligence did not exist.
531120	535760	This is not the first time that the Red Skull has basically been used as a mouthpiece to present
535760	542080	normal liberal or conservative ideas, things that your average person would either agree with or
542080	548160	only marginally disagree with because the writer of the story is so far out there that they actually
548160	555200	think these reasonable normal everyday positions are fascism. Back during that whole Captain
555200	560480	America says hail Hydra nonsense, that was a meme a few years ago. This was the incarnation of the
560480	565520	Red Skull in that story. We grow in number each time I visit. Thank you my friends for your
565520	571360	courage and dedication to our cause. I have just come from Europe, my homeland in fact, and you
571360	578000	know what I saw there? It was an invading army, these so-called refugees, millions of them marching
578000	582640	across the continent, bringing their fanatical beliefs and their crime with them. They attack
582640	587840	our women and bomb our cities. And how do our leaders respond? Do they push them back and enforce
587840	594080	the borders as is our sovereign duty? No of course not, they say here take our food, take our shelter,
594080	599280	take our way of life, and then take our lives, despicable. So it is good to be here where some
599280	603680	men still know how to fight. When I was a young man there was a great war and our two countries
603680	608400	did not see eye to eye, but all the sides they all agreed on certain things, the fundamental
608400	612880	responsibilities of a nation, protecting the land through strength, preserving the heritage and
612880	618160	culture of the people, offering them opportunity. Now look at the world today, look here at the dead
618160	624000	husk that was these United States, how the mighty have fallen. Who is protected I ask you? On my
624000	628720	flight I was briefed about these brave patriots fighting the government's illegal claims to their
628720	633440	land. Who does the land belong to if not the people? This is who your government sees as the
633440	638480	transgressors? What about the criminal transgressors who make a mockery of your borders? No they are
638480	643040	protected of course, but that is only the beginning, your entire culture is under siege.
643040	647520	The principles that your country was founded upon lost in the name of tolerance, your religion,
647520	652320	your beliefs, your sense of community, all tossed aside like trash and you cannot even speak out
652320	657040	against it lest you be called a bigot. And who benefits from all this but the vultures feasting
657040	661920	on the carcass, the bankers who stole your homes out from under you and the politicians they have
661920	666880	purchased? Well let them call you what they will, I know who you truly are. The beginning of a
666880	671040	revolution, the first to see the collapse of the old guard and the road to something glorious,
671040	676800	the glory of hydra. Now if you weren't looking at you know the the obvious picture of the red
676800	683760	skull and you just closed your eyes and tried to think of what political alignment this individual
683760	688880	could possibly have been, would you consider him to be a socialist? I mean possibly he talks about
688880	693440	bankers and purchased politicians, he talks about revolution, he could be a fascist because he talks
693440	698000	about the land, he talks about the responsibilities of a nation, he talks about the people,
698000	703760	he could also be a liberal because even a properly liberal society has a mandate to establish and
703760	709120	enforce borders, to expel illegal immigrants, to defend itself from a foreign invasion if there
709120	713760	is one. This comic was published during the migrant crisis that was happening and to some
713760	720960	extent is still happening back around I think 2016 and the red skull is expressing the rather normal,
720960	725760	rather reasonable conservative position, though he's obviously ramped up the rhetoric a little
725760	730400	bit, that nations have a right to exist, to be separate, to have borders and to control their
730400	737120	own immigration policy. And this idea that being anti-migration is fascism is is just ridiculous,
737920	741840	yet here we are. There are other times where comics have been co-opted in this way,
741840	746720	to be used as a mouthpiece for the writer's stupid political opinions. After all the joker might be a
746720	752480	mobster and a homicidal maniac but he's an american, he hates nazis, for all of his sins
752480	760480	he's not a traitor. It is incredibly stupid, like beyond words, to think that all of the terrible
760480	767280	stuff that joker has done across all of his incarnations and nazism is where he draws the line,
767280	772320	but that is the situation that we find ourselves in. Somebody who is obviously evil has to claim
772320	778000	that nazism is worse than him. Meanwhile the actual nazi characters like the red skull,
778000	783680	they must present milquetoast liberal takes, because the socialists understand the fascists
783680	788400	aren't their enemy, the fascists are gone, the fascists aren't the one currently standing in
788400	793520	their way, the liberals are, and they have no argument against liberalism, so they have to
793520	798640	make it seem like fascism. This is ridiculous but it is of course not new. It seems to be a running
798640	804800	theme that I'm an old man on this channel because I am old enough to remember when Dr. Doom shed a
804800	814320	tear when 9-11 happened. Here's Dr. Doom's monologue. The story of humanity is not written
814320	820720	in towers but in tears, in the common coin of blood and bone, in the voice that speaks within
820720	825680	even the worst of us and says this is not right, because even the worst of us, however scarred,
825760	830240	are still human, still feel, still mourn the random death of innocence.
831040	838080	This is, okay, Dr. Doom is like on the level of the red skull in terms of being evil and all the
838080	843760	heinous shit he's committed over the years, but because of the popular opinion of the 2000s.
843760	849120	Of course Dr. Doom would cry when the twin towers collapsed, even though realistically that's
849120	854320	something he might actually do himself being a terrorist. In much the same vein, the red skull's
854320	860880	most evil fascism has to be boiled down to Jordan Peterson's milk toast liberal takes,
860880	868160	because these people don't understand that, I still can't believe I have to say this,
868160	871680	that they're supposed to be making something that's entertaining, and you can have political
871680	874640	messages of something that's entertaining, but if you are twisting around the pre-established
874640	878400	personalities of these characters for your political point you have already lost the game.
878400	882320	Liberalism is not fascism, red skull is not Jordan Peterson,
883040	886880	Dr. Doom would not cry at the collapse of the twin towers.
886880	890160	I miss this Captain America, it doesn't matter what the press says,
890160	893920	doesn't matter what the politicians or the mobs say, doesn't matter if the whole country decides
893920	897680	that something wrong is something right. This nation was founded on one principle above all
897680	902560	else, the requirement that we stand up for what we believe no matter the odds or the consequences.
902560	907280	When the mob and the press and the whole world tells you to move, your job is to plant yourself
907280	911600	like a tree beside the river of truth and tell the whole world, no, you move.
911600	917280	In the latest incarnation of Captain America, this is something that Red Skull would say,
917280	921520	but you know what my friends, this is the only Jordan Peterson comic I'm gonna read.
921520	924640	What the fuck, nothing's getting into him, keep yelling the buzzwords,
924640	928560	people don't listen to his reasoning, racist, bigot, nazi, it's working,
928560	931200	make more noise comrades, I'm gonna show my tits.
931760	936880	Quickly now, punch that fascist in the face, hear me creatures of the underworld,
936880	942400	the evil archetype, Satan to Christ, Cain to Abel, Loki to Thor, Darkness to Light,
942400	948320	Chaos to Order, I command you, go home and clean your room.
953600	961920	I still personally cannot believe that somebody as normal and as unoffensive as Jordan Peterson
961920	963280	has been made out to be a nazi.
964000	970080	I understand why, like I can believe it, but like emotionally, viscerally, I can't believe it.
970080	976000	I know Sargon's take earlier today was that they have done it because the radical socialists,
976000	977920	the leftists, they are so far out to lunch.
977920	981280	Liberalism and fascism, even though they are opposing points of view,
981280	986240	are two dots off in the distance and so they look together, that was Sargon's conception of it.
986240	988800	And there's some truth to this, but there's more to it I think.
988800	991600	I think there's also active subterfuge here.
991600	994800	It's like I said, fascists largely do not exist anymore.
994800	997680	It is the liberals who are opposing socialism now.
997680	1001200	It is the liberals who are the primary enemy of socialism.
1001200	1004560	If there is ever a socialist revolution, it will be the liberals that oppose them.
1004560	1007920	And so the liberals have to be dispatched from their point of view.
1007920	1011040	And yet they have no real argument against liberalism.
1011040	1016240	So anytime they can find some overlapping similarity between liberalism and fascism,
1016240	1020320	that must be chipped off, it must be partitioned away from liberalism.
1020320	1023120	This is why you keep seeing the joke that like,
1023120	1025840	Hitler was a vegan, therefore vegans are fascists.
1025840	1028880	Hitler breathed air, therefore if you breathe air you're a fascist.
1028880	1030640	That is what that joke is referring to.
1030640	1036080	The socialist subterfuge to undermine liberalism by constantly calling it fascism.
1036080	1037120	When it is not.
1037120	1040000	Liberalism is not the handmaiden of fascism.
1040000	1042000	Liberalism does not excuse fascism.
1042000	1044640	Liberalism does not lead to fascism.
1044640	1047760	Liberalism is the only true opponent to fascism.
1047760	1053440	And I do believe that Hayek was right when he said that fascism is the stage after socialism
1053440	1056960	once communism has proved itself to be impossible to obtain.
1056960	1062160	But I'll put it in shorter words that I think at least some leftists will appreciate the irony of.
1062160	1064320	Fascism is socialism in decay.
