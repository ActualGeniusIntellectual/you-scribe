1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
Jordan Peterson is a Nazi

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,960
Of course, this is something that we've heard for years now. Ever since Jordan Peterson's

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,560
psychology lectures started getting a whole bunch of views online back in I think 2014 or 2015,

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,280
and he started to become known for being a self-help guy, and regardless of what you

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,280
think of his takes on philosophy or religion, his self-help advice generally does seem to work.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,560
But politically, he represents a fundamentally liberal point of view, which got him into some

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,440
trouble when he spoke out against the compelled speech legislation happening in Canada at the

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,760
time. So the left calls him a fascist, not because he actually is a fascist, but because the left is

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,960
so far off the political spectrum that liberals and fascists look to be the exact same thing.

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,160
So this happened a couple days ago, where Jordan Peterson says,

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,360
what the hell, to a segment of a Captain America comic where Red Skull is portrayed as a YouTuber

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:13,520
and... I can't believe we're talking about this, this is ridiculous. Red Skull is a YouTuber who's

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,440
currently, you know, speaking, and it seems quite angrily speaking at the viewer, in a video called

14
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,440
10 Rules for Life. The linked videos on the side are Chaos and Order, Carl Luger's Genius,

15
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,480
and the Feminist Trap. It's not exactly subtle, Jordan Peterson's book is 12 Rules for Life and

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,880
Antidote to Chaos, and his second book is 12 More Rules for Life Beyond Order. For those of you who

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,080
don't know about the Captain America lore, Hydra was founded as a component of the Nazi war machine

18
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,160
and Red Skull is a German. It later broke off to be its own thing in future stories after the Second

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,440
World War, but it definitely has a fascist component. So let me get this straight, let me

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:53,600
get this straight, Marvel, you're saying that Jordan Peterson, a psychologist, somebody who is

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,760
by modern political sensibilities a very generic conservative, somebody who writes positive

22
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,520
messages for men because he believes, in my opinion rightly so at least to some extent,

23
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,560
that there is not enough, I don't know, positive energy going towards men right now. There's a lot

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,480
of focus on toxic masculinity, and let's be honest here guys, you can't really argue with the

25
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,360
existence of toxic masculinity. The wife beater, the tyrannical father, the rapist, the corrupt

26
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,520
king, these are all parts of masculinity that are indeed toxic, but there is obviously a positive,

27
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,360
non-toxic, wholesome, flourishing masculinity as well, and the problem of toxic masculinity is not

28
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,040
solved by becoming feminine, but it is by becoming positively masculine. But anyway, Marvel is

29
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,360
comparing Red Skull, the Nazi, to Jordan Peterson, the honestly very mild-mannered person. Here's the

30
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,000
full page, Captain America says, let me guess, your brother, he disappears into the internet,

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,080
and when he comes back out, he can't stop talking about his new theory of the world,

32
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,440
and that theory comes from one man, Jordan Red Skull Peterson. It's the same for all of them,

33
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,760
young men, weak, looking for purpose, I found the flag, you found the badge, they found the skull.

34
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,160
He tells them what they've always longed to hear, that they're secretly great, that the whole world

35
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,560
is against them, that if they're truly men they'll fight back, and bingo, that's their purpose,

36
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,960
that's what they live for, and that's what they die for. This page is only presenting Red Skull's

37
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:23,120
position without actually refuting it, because the honest truth is, if you remove all of the

38
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,040
avenues for a person to actually, you know, find purpose, find meaning in their lives,

39
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,960
they are going to gravitate towards something that's destructive. That seems obvious, right?

40
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:39,040
Like, if there's no longer any virtue in being a good worker, or being a good entrepreneur,

41
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,520
or being a good inventor, or being a good father, then why would men play your game?

42
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,560
Why wouldn't they just say, fuck you, I'll do whatever I want? If society is failing men,

43
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,880
then you cannot blame them when they decide to shift their interest to something that they feel

44
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,600
does not fail them. Jordan Peterson's message is largely positive, but this comic says that instead

45
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,640
of Jordan Peterson, these people are going towards the Red Skull. So let's listen to the Red Skull's

46
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,520
message. What has happened to the men of the world is truly one of the great tragedies of our time.

47
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,800
Once the American man was a conqueror, now he is but a caretaker. And a caretaker of what? He

48
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,600
stands for some amorphous dream, a dream of nothing. But what I offer you is more than just

49
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,640
some petty dream, more than a life of tending the hearth. No more shall women be summoned to

50
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,920
fight your battles. I offer steel for your spine and iron for your gut. I offer you the

51
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:35,040
sword of manhood. Worst part about it is, um, that's actually not all that objectionable to

52
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,280
somebody who's not an insane fucking radical. Like, let's go over it, okay?

53
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,400
Once the American man was a conqueror, now he's a caretaker. You could see some negativity in that.

54
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,680
I understand, you know, being a conqueror is, there's glory in it, but it's also not necessarily

55
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,520
good, especially for the conquered peoples. And clearly we do not really live in an age where

56
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,000
colonization is considered acceptable anymore because liberalism has progressed our morals to

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,960
that point. So I understand his position. A caretaker of what? He stands for some amorphous

58
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,880
dream, a dream of nothing. I mean, yeah, when you take away every positive thing that people have

59
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,040
about themselves, what do you expect happens? What I offer you is more than just some petty

60
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,840
dream, more than a life of tending the hearth. No more shall women be summoned to fight your battles.

61
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,360
I think this would resonate with people just because there is, you know, a psychological

62
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,080
need to go on an adventure, to do something new. Not everything has to be an adventure,

63
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,080
but there is definitely a call to adventure. That's the whole point of the hero's journey

64
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,240
and storytelling. And also I've noticed when it comes to the creative spaces,

65
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,520
progressives absolutely hate the hero's journey. There is a hatred of heroism on the left because

66
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,720
fascists legitimately do glorify heroism, but so do liberals and they can't tell the difference.

67
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,840
I offer steel for your spine and iron for your gut. I offer you the sword of manhood. Again,

68
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,280
a positive vision of masculinity is absolutely required and steel for your spine and iron for

69
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,840
your gut. You know, that's, that's not negative actually. It's that's actually straight up

70
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,560
positive. Sometimes you need to be stoic. Sometimes you need to do what has to be done.

71
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,880
And sometimes that steel means that you must object to what you are being told to do because

72
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,360
you know, it's wrong. This entire speech is presented such that the reader should view it

73
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,040
to be negative because it is a critique of power, but power itself is not the problem. In a liberal

74
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,240
meritocratic system, competence is the virtue. Power is what you get as a by-product of that.

75
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,160
But the socialist position does not actually think that deep. They don't view competence.

76
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,720
And when they do, they don't accept it. They think it's false. So to them, it's only power.

77
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,400
Of course, Jordan Peterson, being a boomer, let's be honest here, guys. He's a little bit

78
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,040
disconnected. He has to ask, do I really live in a universe where Ta-Nehisi Coates,

79
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,280
is it Coates? I don't know how to pronounce this. This guy's name has written a captain America

80
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,360
comic featuring a parody of my ideas as a part of the philosophy of the arch villain red skull.

81
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,680
Oh, look, Anthony Fantano. Look at that shoe. It fits. I didn't even know about Anthony Fantano

82
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,800
until doing research for this video. But apparently back in 2017, he made like

83
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,480
edgelord anti SJW content. And presumably because he's a fucking coward, he cucked

84
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:14,080
out and became a socialist. Yeah. And when Anthony Fantano was asked about Jordan Peterson

85
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,720
actually being a Nazi, he links a talk between Peterson and Stefan Molyneux saying that he's

86
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,840
talking to a fascist. I don't think Stefan Molyneux is a fascist. Isn't he just like an

87
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,640
end cap or something? Also, I guess talking with a fascist now makes you a fascist in support of

88
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:35,280
baseless race and IQ science. Hold on, hold on. You do know that you learn in first year

89
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,560
university level psychology that IQ is the strongest research that has ever come out

90
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,480
of any of the social sciences. Anthony, do you consider reality itself to be fascist?

91
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:53,600
Also at this point, I have to point out this idea that Nazis are somehow obsessed with IQ science

92
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,400
is a complete falsehood. Contradicting common beliefs, national socialists were opposed to

93
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,560
intelligence research. In their view, intelligence research would represent a supremacy of bourgeoisie

94
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,640
spirit. Intelligence measurement would be an instrument of the jury to fortify its hegemony.

95
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,920
Selection in schools, according to intelligence, would stand for a system of examination of Jewish

96
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:21,760
origin, especially the concept of intelligence as a one dimensional dimension and one common

97
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,840
central factor. Because people differ and therefore intelligence differs, they called

98
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,640
for an intelligence measurement according to a national and typological point of view.

99
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:36,880
For Germans, they asked for a measurement of realism. They were opposed to a measurement

100
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,000
solely of theoretical intelligence, a measurement of intellectualism. Instead, they favored what

101
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
they called practical intelligence. Nazi researchers were opposed to the scientific

102
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,120
methods of correlation and factor analysis and believed that general intelligence did not exist.

103
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,760
This is not the first time that the Red Skull has basically been used as a mouthpiece to present

104
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,080
normal liberal or conservative ideas, things that your average person would either agree with or

105
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,160
only marginally disagree with because the writer of the story is so far out there that they actually

106
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:15,200
think these reasonable normal everyday positions are fascism. Back during that whole Captain

107
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,480
America says hail Hydra nonsense, that was a meme a few years ago. This was the incarnation of the

108
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,520
Red Skull in that story. We grow in number each time I visit. Thank you my friends for your

109
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,360
courage and dedication to our cause. I have just come from Europe, my homeland in fact, and you

110
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,000
know what I saw there? It was an invading army, these so-called refugees, millions of them marching

111
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,640
across the continent, bringing their fanatical beliefs and their crime with them. They attack

112
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,840
our women and bomb our cities. And how do our leaders respond? Do they push them back and enforce

113
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:54,080
the borders as is our sovereign duty? No of course not, they say here take our food, take our shelter,

114
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,280
take our way of life, and then take our lives, despicable. So it is good to be here where some

115
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,680
men still know how to fight. When I was a young man there was a great war and our two countries

116
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,400
did not see eye to eye, but all the sides they all agreed on certain things, the fundamental

117
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,880
responsibilities of a nation, protecting the land through strength, preserving the heritage and

118
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,160
culture of the people, offering them opportunity. Now look at the world today, look here at the dead

119
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,000
husk that was these United States, how the mighty have fallen. Who is protected I ask you? On my

120
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,720
flight I was briefed about these brave patriots fighting the government's illegal claims to their

121
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,440
land. Who does the land belong to if not the people? This is who your government sees as the

122
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,480
transgressors? What about the criminal transgressors who make a mockery of your borders? No they are

123
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,040
protected of course, but that is only the beginning, your entire culture is under siege.

124
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,520
The principles that your country was founded upon lost in the name of tolerance, your religion,

125
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,320
your beliefs, your sense of community, all tossed aside like trash and you cannot even speak out

126
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,040
against it lest you be called a bigot. And who benefits from all this but the vultures feasting

127
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,920
on the carcass, the bankers who stole your homes out from under you and the politicians they have

128
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,880
purchased? Well let them call you what they will, I know who you truly are. The beginning of a

129
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,040
revolution, the first to see the collapse of the old guard and the road to something glorious,

130
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,800
the glory of hydra. Now if you weren't looking at you know the the obvious picture of the red

131
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,760
skull and you just closed your eyes and tried to think of what political alignment this individual

132
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,880
could possibly have been, would you consider him to be a socialist? I mean possibly he talks about

133
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,440
bankers and purchased politicians, he talks about revolution, he could be a fascist because he talks

134
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,000
about the land, he talks about the responsibilities of a nation, he talks about the people,

135
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,760
he could also be a liberal because even a properly liberal society has a mandate to establish and

136
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,120
enforce borders, to expel illegal immigrants, to defend itself from a foreign invasion if there

137
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,760
is one. This comic was published during the migrant crisis that was happening and to some

138
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:00,960
extent is still happening back around I think 2016 and the red skull is expressing the rather normal,

139
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,760
rather reasonable conservative position, though he's obviously ramped up the rhetoric a little

140
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,400
bit, that nations have a right to exist, to be separate, to have borders and to control their

141
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:17,120
own immigration policy. And this idea that being anti-migration is fascism is is just ridiculous,

142
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,840
yet here we are. There are other times where comics have been co-opted in this way,

143
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,720
to be used as a mouthpiece for the writer's stupid political opinions. After all the joker might be a

144
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,480
mobster and a homicidal maniac but he's an american, he hates nazis, for all of his sins

145
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:40,480
he's not a traitor. It is incredibly stupid, like beyond words, to think that all of the terrible

146
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,280
stuff that joker has done across all of his incarnations and nazism is where he draws the line,

147
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,320
but that is the situation that we find ourselves in. Somebody who is obviously evil has to claim

148
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,000
that nazism is worse than him. Meanwhile the actual nazi characters like the red skull,

149
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,680
they must present milquetoast liberal takes, because the socialists understand the fascists

150
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,400
aren't their enemy, the fascists are gone, the fascists aren't the one currently standing in

151
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,520
their way, the liberals are, and they have no argument against liberalism, so they have to

152
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,640
make it seem like fascism. This is ridiculous but it is of course not new. It seems to be a running

153
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,800
theme that I'm an old man on this channel because I am old enough to remember when Dr. Doom shed a

154
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:34,320
tear when 9-11 happened. Here's Dr. Doom's monologue. The story of humanity is not written

155
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,720
in towers but in tears, in the common coin of blood and bone, in the voice that speaks within

156
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,680
even the worst of us and says this is not right, because even the worst of us, however scarred,

157
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,240
are still human, still feel, still mourn the random death of innocence.

158
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:58,080
This is, okay, Dr. Doom is like on the level of the red skull in terms of being evil and all the

159
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,760
heinous shit he's committed over the years, but because of the popular opinion of the 2000s.

160
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,120
Of course Dr. Doom would cry when the twin towers collapsed, even though realistically that's

161
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,320
something he might actually do himself being a terrorist. In much the same vein, the red skull's

162
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,880
most evil fascism has to be boiled down to Jordan Peterson's milk toast liberal takes,

163
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:28,160
because these people don't understand that, I still can't believe I have to say this,

164
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,680
that they're supposed to be making something that's entertaining, and you can have political

165
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,640
messages of something that's entertaining, but if you are twisting around the pre-established

166
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,400
personalities of these characters for your political point you have already lost the game.

167
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,320
Liberalism is not fascism, red skull is not Jordan Peterson,

168
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,880
Dr. Doom would not cry at the collapse of the twin towers.

169
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,160
I miss this Captain America, it doesn't matter what the press says,

170
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,920
doesn't matter what the politicians or the mobs say, doesn't matter if the whole country decides

171
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,680
that something wrong is something right. This nation was founded on one principle above all

172
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,560
else, the requirement that we stand up for what we believe no matter the odds or the consequences.

173
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,280
When the mob and the press and the whole world tells you to move, your job is to plant yourself

174
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,600
like a tree beside the river of truth and tell the whole world, no, you move.

175
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,280
In the latest incarnation of Captain America, this is something that Red Skull would say,

176
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,520
but you know what my friends, this is the only Jordan Peterson comic I'm gonna read.

177
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,640
What the fuck, nothing's getting into him, keep yelling the buzzwords,

178
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,560
people don't listen to his reasoning, racist, bigot, nazi, it's working,

179
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,200
make more noise comrades, I'm gonna show my tits.

180
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,880
Quickly now, punch that fascist in the face, hear me creatures of the underworld,

181
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,400
the evil archetype, Satan to Christ, Cain to Abel, Loki to Thor, Darkness to Light,

182
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,320
Chaos to Order, I command you, go home and clean your room.

183
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:01,920
I still personally cannot believe that somebody as normal and as unoffensive as Jordan Peterson

184
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,280
has been made out to be a nazi.

185
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,080
I understand why, like I can believe it, but like emotionally, viscerally, I can't believe it.

186
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:16,000
I know Sargon's take earlier today was that they have done it because the radical socialists,

187
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,920
the leftists, they are so far out to lunch.

188
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,280
Liberalism and fascism, even though they are opposing points of view,

189
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:26,240
are two dots off in the distance and so they look together, that was Sargon's conception of it.

190
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,800
And there's some truth to this, but there's more to it I think.

191
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,600
I think there's also active subterfuge here.

192
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,800
It's like I said, fascists largely do not exist anymore.

193
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,680
It is the liberals who are opposing socialism now.

194
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,200
It is the liberals who are the primary enemy of socialism.

195
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,560
If there is ever a socialist revolution, it will be the liberals that oppose them.

196
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,920
And so the liberals have to be dispatched from their point of view.

197
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,040
And yet they have no real argument against liberalism.

198
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,240
So anytime they can find some overlapping similarity between liberalism and fascism,

199
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,320
that must be chipped off, it must be partitioned away from liberalism.

200
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,120
This is why you keep seeing the joke that like,

201
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,840
Hitler was a vegan, therefore vegans are fascists.

202
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,880
Hitler breathed air, therefore if you breathe air you're a fascist.

203
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,640
That is what that joke is referring to.

204
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,080
The socialist subterfuge to undermine liberalism by constantly calling it fascism.

205
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,120
When it is not.

206
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,000
Liberalism is not the handmaiden of fascism.

207
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Liberalism does not excuse fascism.

208
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,640
Liberalism does not lead to fascism.

209
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,760
Liberalism is the only true opponent to fascism.

210
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,440
And I do believe that Hayek was right when he said that fascism is the stage after socialism

211
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,960
once communism has proved itself to be impossible to obtain.

212
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,160
But I'll put it in shorter words that I think at least some leftists will appreciate the irony of.

213
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,320
Fascism is socialism in decay.

214
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,880
