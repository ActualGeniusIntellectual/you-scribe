0	10960	One of the big reasons people didn't like Santa, Inc., well, one of, like, one thousand
10960	15760	reasons was that the story revolved around having a non-traditional Santa, whether that
15760	20280	be the Black Santa, who leaves the company at the start of the show, or the Jewish Female
20280	23040	Elf Santa, which the show revolves around mainly.
23040	28800	The show plays it up as a joke that the current Santa wants to make history, break new ground,
28800	31280	by bringing in these diversity hires.
31280	36680	But unfortunately for us in the real world, this attitude is common, and it's been going
36680	38880	on for a lot longer than Santa, Inc.
38880	42260	Santa Claus should not be a white man anymore.
42260	45980	It's time to give Saint Nick his long overdue makeup.
45980	49940	This was from December 10th, 2013.
49940	52040	When I was a kid, I knew two different Santa Clauses.
52040	57080	The first had a fat belly, rosy cheeks, a long white beard, and skin as pink as bubble
57080	58080	gum.
58080	62120	There was the omnipresent visiting my preschool in the local mall, visible in all of my favorite
62120	63120	Christmas specials.
63120	67720	Then there was the Santa in my family's household, in the form of ornaments, cards, and holiday
67720	68720	figurines.
68720	73680	A near carbon copy of the first one, big belly, rosy cheeks, long white beard, check, check,
73680	74680	check.
74680	76320	But his skin was as dark as mine.
76320	78800	Seeing two different Santas was bewildering.
78800	81040	Eventually I asked my father what Santa really looked like.
81040	83640	Was he brown like us, or was he really a white guy?
83640	85740	My father replied that Santa was every color.
85740	90020	Whatever house he visited, jolly old Saint Nicholas magically turned into the likeness
90020	91300	of the family that lived there.
91300	95220	Now I mean, historically that's kind of strange because Saint Nicholas was a real person,
95220	99300	but to be honest, the people who fall back in that argument when discussing magical creatures
99300	103180	or fairy tales, that sort of thing, I don't necessarily buy it.
103180	106620	This seems like the proper answer from this father.
106620	110340	You know, why can't there be a black Santa that comes to black families?
110340	114380	The point is that they're not erasing the white Santa, they're just expanding on the
114380	115380	idea.
115420	118220	Some people might not like that and I understand their point of view, but this doesn't seem
118220	119460	too objectionable.
119460	125100	Two decades later, America is less and less white, but a melanin deficient Santa remains
125100	129100	the default in commercials, mall casting calls, and movies.
129100	134020	Isn't it time that our image of Santa better serve all the children he delights each Christmas?
134020	138900	If her idea is to literally make the default Santa black, that is actually the bad end.
138900	143740	I propose that America abandons Santa as a fat old white man and create a new symbol
143740	145180	of Christmas cheer.
145180	148700	From here on out, Santa Claus should be a penguin.
148700	149700	That's right, a penguin.
149700	150700	Okay.
150700	151700	You got me, dude.
151700	152940	Wait a minute.
152940	154260	Correction issued.
154260	157260	This article originally identified penguins as mammals.
157260	158260	They're birds.
158260	159260	Ooh.
159260	160260	How?
160260	162780	How do you know?
162780	164780	All right.
164780	169940	I mean, I guess making Santa a penguin gets rid of the whole race issue, but are you going
169940	174060	to do this with every single mythological character that has a race attached to them
174060	177640	or that is in the guise of a human and therefore has to look like somebody?
177640	179300	Are we all going to be furries in the future?
179300	182340	Well, the Santa revisionism didn't stop here.
182340	185380	This is from blackenterprise.com.
185380	188360	Sorry America, Santa Claus isn't white.
188360	192460	The African American man hired to play Santa Claus at the Mall of America in Minnesota
192460	196500	earlier this month sparked an uproar on the internet and even a call to boycott the nation's
196500	197980	largest shopping center.
197980	202220	Nevertheless, it's become pretty clear that America can't handle the idea of a black Santa.
202220	203220	No fucking way.
203380	204380	Hold on.
204380	207180	Mall of America welcomes its first black Santa.
207180	211060	Visiting for four days, Larry Jefferson is the first black Santa to listen to kids' wish
211060	212060	lists.
212060	214540	Dozens of Santas cycle through Twin City shopping centers each year.
214540	217940	This week, for the first time in Mall of America's 24-year history, a black Santa will greet
217940	218940	families.
218940	221300	This is a long time coming, said the owner of the Santa Experience.
221300	225380	Okay, but where's the part where white people get angry?
225380	227540	I'm not seeing it.
227540	230180	Back to the Black Enterprise article.
230180	232220	Cue white tears.
232220	233220	Where's the white tears?
233220	235580	Where's the white tears, dude?
235580	237780	There's more evidence that Santa Claus wasn't a white man.
237780	238780	Oh, we gotta see this.
238780	242140	I know that we was kangs, but we've also been we was Santas, eh?
242140	245820	The jolly mythical man we know as Santa Claus has been traced back to Saint Nicholas, who
245820	250060	was born in the second half of the third century, yes, we already know this, in modern-day Turkey.
250060	251060	Okay.
251060	254500	Although Saint Nicholas has been portrayed in icons as a white man with rosy red cheeks
254500	258820	for centuries, a modern-day forensic study of the bishop's bones discovered that he resembled
258820	260140	a light brown man of color.
260260	262300	I don't think this means he's black, though, does it?
262300	267340	I mean, people from Turkey generally range between looking kind of Arab to looking mostly
267340	268340	white.
268340	269340	It's not just race, though.
269340	274300	Is only hiring male Santa impersonators discrimination against women?
274300	276540	Oh, shit, dude.
276540	278140	Here's the real gender gap.
278140	281940	There's a whole bunch of women Santas out there who just, they're just not getting those
281940	284940	interviews, those callbacks, those job opportunities.
284940	288700	Santa has always been a jolly fat man, famed for his massive white beard.
288700	290060	That's what kids expect, right?
290980	291980	So, why change tradition?
291980	292980	Well, why not?
292980	293980	Santa is a fictional construct, after all.
293980	297820	I mean, yes, that's true, Santa is a fictional construct, and you can change your traditions
297820	302520	if you want, but you have to understand, things are traditions for a reason.
302520	305540	They have resonance with the wider culture for a reason.
305540	311780	Your new tradition is not going to have the same deep connections to most people that
311780	313340	the old traditions do.
313340	316820	This is why we have the phenomenon of the progressive skin suit, where rather than progressive
316820	321900	creators making new properties, they co-opt and conquer old ones, ones that have already
321900	327440	been established, ones that are already loved by their fanbases, and then corrupt those
327440	329060	from the inside out.
329060	333620	Could being turned down for a paying job in the basis of gender be considered discrimination,
333620	337160	even if it is as a role playing father Christmas?
337160	338500	In short, no.
338500	343020	If being male is an occupational requirement for the role, it is okay to hire based on
343020	344020	gender.
344020	348740	Which begs the question, is being male an occupational requirement of being Santa?
348740	351260	Um, yeah.
351260	353060	It seems to be the case.
353060	355500	And then this happened just last year.
355500	360340	Liberal Santa makes kid cry by telling him he won't give him a gun for Christmas.
360340	361820	A Nerf gun, that is.
361820	362820	Jesus.
362820	365420	Hold on, this is an article, but there's got to be a video on this, right?
365420	366420	Yeah, yeah, here it is.
366420	367420	Let's check this out.
367420	368420	Nope, no gun.
368420	369420	Nerf gun.
369420	373420	Nope, not even a Nerf gun.
373820	374820	Nope.
374820	378820	If your dad wants to get it for you, that's fine, but I can't bring it to you.
378820	379820	But what else would you like?
379820	381820	Lots of other toys.
381820	386820	There's Legos, there's bicycles, there's cars and trucks.
386820	390820	What do you think?
390820	393820	What do you think?
393820	395820	It's okay, buddy.
395820	396820	It's okay.
396820	397820	Your dad?
397820	400420	Oh, come the fuck on, man.
400420	405020	Well, it turns out that the mall Santa was actually fired, and the mall personally sent
405020	410020	another Santa to the boy's house after the incident went viral on Facebook.
410020	413020	And yes, the new Santa gave him his Nerf gun.
413020	416020	There was a mistake made yesterday, huh?
416020	417020	Yeah.
417020	419020	Well, we're so sorry about that.
419020	420020	Okay?
420020	425020	Can Santa come in?
425020	428020	This is big.
428620	436620	But I heard you were coming to check on me from Elmer's house.
436620	439620	Yo, I heard about this up at the North Pole.
439620	440620	Yummy.
440620	442620	And I rushed down the hill.
442620	445620	But this is crazy.
445620	448620	Listen for this.
448620	452620	Wait.
452620	454620	This is...
454620	457620	It's just a Nerf gun.
458220	462220	This is crazy, this thing.
462220	464220	What did you say?
464220	466220	Thanks.
466220	470220	Well, thank you.
470220	473220	It just seems to be incredible to me that we've gotten to this point, you know?
473220	478220	Like that first article from 2013, it was played off as a joke.
478220	484220	She went for the penguin route, because even back in 2013, everyone knew how ridiculous this was.
484220	487220	How ridiculous it sounded to the average person.
487820	493820	And here we are, 2020, and woke ass Santas are breaking kids' hearts by telling them they can't have toy guns.
493820	499820	This post on Twitter went viral this year, where Richard Grinnell, someone who apparently worked for Trump, says
499820	503820	stop voting for Democrats with a picture of a gingerbread person.
503820	506820	And it's like, okay, yeah, fair enough, that's kind of stupid.
506820	509820	Who really cares if it's called a gingerbread person?
509820	511820	Like, yeah, we all get it.
511820	513820	It's a gingerbread man.
513820	515820	But does it really matter that much?
516420	519420	I probably wouldn't buy it, but I wouldn't make a big deal about it.
519420	521420	This is just a natural progression of the same ideas.
521420	528420	Three years ago, gingerbread men were banned at the Scottish parliament as part of a new drive to stamp out sexism.
528420	531420	A single data point is funny.
531420	533420	It's a meme, it's a joke, it's a viral post.
533420	538420	When you start to collect multiple data points, when you start to build a story,
538420	545420	that's when you begin to realize that, oh, this isn't just some woke idiot who happens to be in a position of marginal power in one location.
546020	549020	Gingerbread men are replaced by gingerbread persons in the Scottish parliament.
549020	553020	The parliament coffee shop renamed the sweet treat in case it causes offense.
553020	560020	A survey found 30% of women working in the Scottish parliament believe they had been sexually harassed.
560020	563020	How do we get from gingerbread persons to sexual harassment?
563020	566020	We went from 0 to 60 pretty fucking fast here.
566020	569020	Listen, the Me Too movement just needs to be more inclusive, alright?
569020	573020	It needs to be inclusive of victims of gingerbread men violence.
573620	577620	An age-old question about Santa is tearing one parenting community apart.
577620	583620	I love Christmas, but I have known for a long time that I probably wouldn't be up for maintaining a fiction around the existence of Santa Claus around child.
583620	585620	I'm no good at on-the-spot fibbing.
585620	588620	I've become extremely uncomfortable watching TV shows or reading books,
588620	590620	where the plot revolves around people perpetuating long-term lies.
590620	592620	And also, I simply do not like playing.
592620	594620	I've always felt like a real Grinch about it.
594620	597620	Who wouldn't want to give their child all those classic twinkly peppermint memories?
597620	600620	One of my friends believed in Santa until she was 15
601220	604220	because her parents doubled down when she asked multiple times over the years and she trusted them.
604220	608220	She was beyond betrayed and mad and embarrassed when they finally admitted the truth.
608220	612220	We didn't grow up believing in Santa because my mom was extremely poor as a kid and had a very traumatic upbringing
612220	615220	and told us she never understood why some kids got gifts from Santa.
615220	617220	And she tried to be so good and she never got one.
617220	619220	It was really freaking depressing.
619220	620220	See, I kind of get it, right?
620220	624220	Like, I watched a recent video from Sargon over at the Lotus Eaters
624220	625220	and they talked about Santa a little bit.
625220	627220	It wasn't the main point, I don't think. I think it was just a side point.
627220	629220	But I could be wrong. I might be misremembering it.
629820	632820	But the point was, is that it's something magical for a child to believe in
632820	636820	and if you expose them to the truth too early, you have basically ruined it for them.
636820	637820	And that seems to be true.
637820	639820	Kids do a lot of imaginary play.
639820	642820	It doesn't even matter if they think it's truly real or not, at least for some kids.
642820	647820	They do a lot of imaginary play and that's part of growing up, that's part of kind of learning what the world is.
647820	649820	And so it's important to give them the space to engage in that.
649820	653820	But at the same time, I recall being pretty young.
653820	658820	And, you know, maybe my own memories are skewed on this because it was a while ago and I was a kid.
659420	662420	I had very vivid memories of being doubtful of Santa.
662420	667420	It didn't make sense to me that, you know, my Super Nintendo games had Made in Japan printed on them
667420	669420	or were very clearly made by corporations.
669420	672420	Like, they were like, how does Santa get around copyright?
672420	677420	Why is it that all the depictions of the Santa experience are the elves building simplistic toys
677420	679420	and not building complicated electronics?
679420	682420	How did Santa fit down my house's very tiny chimney?
682420	684420	You know, magic, magic, magic.
684420	688420	But like, in other domains of life as a kid, you learn very quickly that magic doesn't exist.
689020	691020	Like, your parents tell you, you know, magic isn't really real.
691020	693020	But when it comes to Santa, it is.
693020	698020	That's the one domain that your parents will generally say, no, magic is real.
698020	702020	So I remember, even as a child, being at least a little bit rational and being like, well, this doesn't make any sense.
702020	707020	Like, there's a lot of evidence that Santa isn't real and there's no evidence that he is, aside from my parents' word.
707020	712020	And I remember being like, asking very honestly, probably younger than they expected,
712620	719620	asking with the intention of getting a straight answer out of them and them saying, of course Santa's real.
719620	724620	And when I finally came to my mom and I was like, you've just been lying this whole time, haven't you?
724620	726620	And she admitted that she was.
726620	729620	That was like the first time when I was like, I can't really trust my parents, can I?
729620	731620	At least for some things.
731620	733620	Like, it sounds kind of petty and ridiculous.
733620	735620	Like, it's Santa. Like, who the fuck cares?
735620	736620	Like, yeah, fair enough.
736620	738620	I'm not like, holding this over their heads now that I'm an adult.
739220	744220	But it was a realization of, like, the fact that your parents actually can just lie to you.
744220	751220	And that doesn't mean that they don't care about you, but it does mean that you can't completely just listen to them blindly.
751220	757220	And I guess for some kids, that's more or less traumatic an experience, depending on their temperament, when it happens, et cetera, et cetera.
757220	761220	So, the people who say, you know, I don't want to break my kids' trust like that, I get it.
761220	763220	It's not an illegitimate argument, I understand.
763820	768820	And you know what? If you ever want to just lose faith in humanity, hop on Twitter and search for Santa and White Man.
768820	780820	My Christmas spirit is coming from the fact that I'm in pre-production for a short film about the North Pole doing a diversity, equity, and inclusion overhaul, firing Santa because he's a cishet white man and replacing him with a black woman named Shaniqua.
780820	782820	Yeah, Santa Inc. tried that and it fucking sucked.
782820	783820	Save your money, dude.
783820	785820	How long did y'all's parents let you believe in Santa?
785820	789820	My mom was not going to let me believe a white man was giving us free stuff.
789820	791820	Okay, that's pretty funny.
792420	799420	My family had to tell me Santa wasn't real fast because I just didn't like the idea of an old white man watching me while I sleep used to cry every night in December.
799420	801420	I'm never going to let my kids believe in Santa.
801420	804420	Given a white man credit for something I did, I don't think so.
804420	809420	My kids will know Santa Claus ain't real, ain't no fat white man taking credit for the work I put in.
809420	811420	As a kid, I never believed in Santa.
811420	820420	As a critical adult and former poor kid of color from the hood, I think it's insulting that an old white man take all the credit for the sacrifices and hustle my parents endured to give us what little they could.
821020	822020	Also, hold the fuck on.
825020	826020	How black are you?
826020	829020	I haven't been able to concentrate or be productive in months.
829020	831020	Like, I've gotten zero work done.
831020	833020	Am I the only one experiencing this? What's wrong with me?
833020	839020	Don't worry, you're a sociology PhD candidate specializing in race, ethnicity, and ethnic studies.
839020	842020	I don't think the labor demands on your field are that high anyway.
842020	844020	Brown, Santa, everything.
844020	850020	How many years has my 70 plus year old father only seen Santa and Jesus portrayed as a white man?
850620	851620	Not anymore.
851620	854620	I'm almost more excited to give him these gift bags than his actual gifts.
854620	856620	Representation matters at every age, at all times.
856620	861620	It's the universalized utopian representation for all people in all eras.
861620	863620	Wait a minute, this person doesn't even look black.
863620	864620	Like, hold on.
866620	867620	I mean, we'd be kind of brown.
867620	869620	Hold on, let's check out this picture here.
870620	871620	Oh, it's a video.
871620	878620	Racialized individuals cannot permanently regulate our nervous system in a society that is not permanently safe.
879220	882220	So, many Western trauma professionals...
886220	887220	Hold on.
887220	893220	Are you making the claim that racialized people, you lack the ability to regulate your nervous system?
893220	896220	It has to be constant, right? Because no society is permanently safe.
896220	899220	You can't make a society permanently safe for anyone.
899220	901220	There's always going to be that outside danger.
901220	902220	There's always going to be inside danger.
902220	905220	There does not exist the absolutely safe society.
905820	911820	So, are you saying that by virtue of your race, you are unable to control yourself?
911820	913820	I don't think you want to go down this road, dude.
914820	920820	In any case, that slow cultural creep, the rot that is infecting everything, is in fact coming for Santa.
920820	923820	And it has been slowly coming for Santa this entire time.
923820	929820	I'm not going to sit here and tell you that there's a war on Christmas, the way that, like, Donald Trump said or something.
929820	932820	It's not offensive to see a white Santa walking around.
933420	935420	It's also really not offensive to see a black Santa walking around.
935420	937420	Or even a woman Santa. It doesn't matter.
937420	939420	It just doesn't matter.
939420	950420	But the point seems to be that there is this hatred that is spewing out at the West's cultural institutions that we have long considered to be common and positive.
950420	954420	The fact that they are ours, that they're normalized here specifically.
954420	961420	There is a contingent of people who are just hell-bent on hating everything normative.
962020	966020	But here, here is the truly 180 IQ take.
966020	968020	You know how Santa knows when you're sleeping?
968020	970020	He knows when you're awake.
970020	972020	He judges you based on being naughty or nice.
972020	974020	How does he know all that information, dude?
974020	980020	Have we been acclimating our kids all this time to the idea that they're constantly being spied on by Santa?
980020	982020	The Santa myth, oh my god, guys.
982020	988020	The Santa myth has been a way of getting our children to be okay with the surveillance state.
988620	990620	Santa and the NSA?
990620	992620	It's like a hand fitting into a well-made glove.
992620	994620	I can't believe it.
994620	996620	I've deduced the mystery.
996620	998620	I've discovered what's truly going on.
998620	1000620	If you truly want to save your kids from this, guys.
1000620	1002620	You gotta head out there.
1002620	1004620	You gotta get all the tinfoil you can muster.
1004620	1006620	And you gotta start building anti-Santa barriers around your property.
1006620	1009620	And let those little fuckers know that Santa ain't visiting this year.
1009620	1011620	Alright, guys.
1011620	1013620	Have a good Christmas. I love you.
1018620	1023620	Merry Christmas!
1023620	1025620	Oh, Santa took off!
