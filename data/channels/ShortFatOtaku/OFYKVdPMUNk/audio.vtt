00:00.000 --> 00:10.960
One of the big reasons people didn't like Santa, Inc., well, one of, like, one thousand

00:10.960 --> 00:15.760
reasons was that the story revolved around having a non-traditional Santa, whether that

00:15.760 --> 00:20.280
be the Black Santa, who leaves the company at the start of the show, or the Jewish Female

00:20.280 --> 00:23.040
Elf Santa, which the show revolves around mainly.

00:23.040 --> 00:28.800
The show plays it up as a joke that the current Santa wants to make history, break new ground,

00:28.800 --> 00:31.280
by bringing in these diversity hires.

00:31.280 --> 00:36.680
But unfortunately for us in the real world, this attitude is common, and it's been going

00:36.680 --> 00:38.880
on for a lot longer than Santa, Inc.

00:38.880 --> 00:42.260
Santa Claus should not be a white man anymore.

00:42.260 --> 00:45.980
It's time to give Saint Nick his long overdue makeup.

00:45.980 --> 00:49.940
This was from December 10th, 2013.

00:49.940 --> 00:52.040
When I was a kid, I knew two different Santa Clauses.

00:52.040 --> 00:57.080
The first had a fat belly, rosy cheeks, a long white beard, and skin as pink as bubble

00:57.080 --> 00:58.080
gum.

00:58.080 --> 01:02.120
There was the omnipresent visiting my preschool in the local mall, visible in all of my favorite

01:02.120 --> 01:03.120
Christmas specials.

01:03.120 --> 01:07.720
Then there was the Santa in my family's household, in the form of ornaments, cards, and holiday

01:07.720 --> 01:08.720
figurines.

01:08.720 --> 01:13.680
A near carbon copy of the first one, big belly, rosy cheeks, long white beard, check, check,

01:13.680 --> 01:14.680
check.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.320
But his skin was as dark as mine.

01:16.320 --> 01:18.800
Seeing two different Santas was bewildering.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.040
Eventually I asked my father what Santa really looked like.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.640
Was he brown like us, or was he really a white guy?

01:23.640 --> 01:25.740
My father replied that Santa was every color.

01:25.740 --> 01:30.020
Whatever house he visited, jolly old Saint Nicholas magically turned into the likeness

01:30.020 --> 01:31.300
of the family that lived there.

01:31.300 --> 01:35.220
Now I mean, historically that's kind of strange because Saint Nicholas was a real person,

01:35.220 --> 01:39.300
but to be honest, the people who fall back in that argument when discussing magical creatures

01:39.300 --> 01:43.180
or fairy tales, that sort of thing, I don't necessarily buy it.

01:43.180 --> 01:46.620
This seems like the proper answer from this father.

01:46.620 --> 01:50.340
You know, why can't there be a black Santa that comes to black families?

01:50.340 --> 01:54.380
The point is that they're not erasing the white Santa, they're just expanding on the

01:54.380 --> 01:55.380
idea.

01:55.420 --> 01:58.220
Some people might not like that and I understand their point of view, but this doesn't seem

01:58.220 --> 01:59.460
too objectionable.

01:59.460 --> 02:05.100
Two decades later, America is less and less white, but a melanin deficient Santa remains

02:05.100 --> 02:09.100
the default in commercials, mall casting calls, and movies.

02:09.100 --> 02:14.020
Isn't it time that our image of Santa better serve all the children he delights each Christmas?

02:14.020 --> 02:18.900
If her idea is to literally make the default Santa black, that is actually the bad end.

02:18.900 --> 02:23.740
I propose that America abandons Santa as a fat old white man and create a new symbol

02:23.740 --> 02:25.180
of Christmas cheer.

02:25.180 --> 02:28.700
From here on out, Santa Claus should be a penguin.

02:28.700 --> 02:29.700
That's right, a penguin.

02:29.700 --> 02:30.700
Okay.

02:30.700 --> 02:31.700
You got me, dude.

02:31.700 --> 02:32.940
Wait a minute.

02:32.940 --> 02:34.260
Correction issued.

02:34.260 --> 02:37.260
This article originally identified penguins as mammals.

02:37.260 --> 02:38.260
They're birds.

02:38.260 --> 02:39.260
Ooh.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.260
How?

02:40.260 --> 02:42.780
How do you know?

02:42.780 --> 02:44.780
All right.

02:44.780 --> 02:49.940
I mean, I guess making Santa a penguin gets rid of the whole race issue, but are you going

02:49.940 --> 02:54.060
to do this with every single mythological character that has a race attached to them

02:54.060 --> 02:57.640
or that is in the guise of a human and therefore has to look like somebody?

02:57.640 --> 02:59.300
Are we all going to be furries in the future?

02:59.300 --> 03:02.340
Well, the Santa revisionism didn't stop here.

03:02.340 --> 03:05.380
This is from blackenterprise.com.

03:05.380 --> 03:08.360
Sorry America, Santa Claus isn't white.

03:08.360 --> 03:12.460
The African American man hired to play Santa Claus at the Mall of America in Minnesota

03:12.460 --> 03:16.500
earlier this month sparked an uproar on the internet and even a call to boycott the nation's

03:16.500 --> 03:17.980
largest shopping center.

03:17.980 --> 03:22.220
Nevertheless, it's become pretty clear that America can't handle the idea of a black Santa.

03:22.220 --> 03:23.220
No fucking way.

03:23.380 --> 03:24.380
Hold on.

03:24.380 --> 03:27.180
Mall of America welcomes its first black Santa.

03:27.180 --> 03:31.060
Visiting for four days, Larry Jefferson is the first black Santa to listen to kids' wish

03:31.060 --> 03:32.060
lists.

03:32.060 --> 03:34.540
Dozens of Santas cycle through Twin City shopping centers each year.

03:34.540 --> 03:37.940
This week, for the first time in Mall of America's 24-year history, a black Santa will greet

03:37.940 --> 03:38.940
families.

03:38.940 --> 03:41.300
This is a long time coming, said the owner of the Santa Experience.

03:41.300 --> 03:45.380
Okay, but where's the part where white people get angry?

03:45.380 --> 03:47.540
I'm not seeing it.

03:47.540 --> 03:50.180
Back to the Black Enterprise article.

03:50.180 --> 03:52.220
Cue white tears.

03:52.220 --> 03:53.220
Where's the white tears?

03:53.220 --> 03:55.580
Where's the white tears, dude?

03:55.580 --> 03:57.780
There's more evidence that Santa Claus wasn't a white man.

03:57.780 --> 03:58.780
Oh, we gotta see this.

03:58.780 --> 04:02.140
I know that we was kangs, but we've also been we was Santas, eh?

04:02.140 --> 04:05.820
The jolly mythical man we know as Santa Claus has been traced back to Saint Nicholas, who

04:05.820 --> 04:10.060
was born in the second half of the third century, yes, we already know this, in modern-day Turkey.

04:10.060 --> 04:11.060
Okay.

04:11.060 --> 04:14.500
Although Saint Nicholas has been portrayed in icons as a white man with rosy red cheeks

04:14.500 --> 04:18.820
for centuries, a modern-day forensic study of the bishop's bones discovered that he resembled

04:18.820 --> 04:20.140
a light brown man of color.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.300
I don't think this means he's black, though, does it?

04:22.300 --> 04:27.340
I mean, people from Turkey generally range between looking kind of Arab to looking mostly

04:27.340 --> 04:28.340
white.

04:28.340 --> 04:29.340
It's not just race, though.

04:29.340 --> 04:34.300
Is only hiring male Santa impersonators discrimination against women?

04:34.300 --> 04:36.540
Oh, shit, dude.

04:36.540 --> 04:38.140
Here's the real gender gap.

04:38.140 --> 04:41.940
There's a whole bunch of women Santas out there who just, they're just not getting those

04:41.940 --> 04:44.940
interviews, those callbacks, those job opportunities.

04:44.940 --> 04:48.700
Santa has always been a jolly fat man, famed for his massive white beard.

04:48.700 --> 04:50.060
That's what kids expect, right?

04:50.980 --> 04:51.980
So, why change tradition?

04:51.980 --> 04:52.980
Well, why not?

04:52.980 --> 04:53.980
Santa is a fictional construct, after all.

04:53.980 --> 04:57.820
I mean, yes, that's true, Santa is a fictional construct, and you can change your traditions

04:57.820 --> 05:02.520
if you want, but you have to understand, things are traditions for a reason.

05:02.520 --> 05:05.540
They have resonance with the wider culture for a reason.

05:05.540 --> 05:11.780
Your new tradition is not going to have the same deep connections to most people that

05:11.780 --> 05:13.340
the old traditions do.

05:13.340 --> 05:16.820
This is why we have the phenomenon of the progressive skin suit, where rather than progressive

05:16.820 --> 05:21.900
creators making new properties, they co-opt and conquer old ones, ones that have already

05:21.900 --> 05:27.440
been established, ones that are already loved by their fanbases, and then corrupt those

05:27.440 --> 05:29.060
from the inside out.

05:29.060 --> 05:33.620
Could being turned down for a paying job in the basis of gender be considered discrimination,

05:33.620 --> 05:37.160
even if it is as a role playing father Christmas?

05:37.160 --> 05:38.500
In short, no.

05:38.500 --> 05:43.020
If being male is an occupational requirement for the role, it is okay to hire based on

05:43.020 --> 05:44.020
gender.

05:44.020 --> 05:48.740
Which begs the question, is being male an occupational requirement of being Santa?

05:48.740 --> 05:51.260
Um, yeah.

05:51.260 --> 05:53.060
It seems to be the case.

05:53.060 --> 05:55.500
And then this happened just last year.

05:55.500 --> 06:00.340
Liberal Santa makes kid cry by telling him he won't give him a gun for Christmas.

06:00.340 --> 06:01.820
A Nerf gun, that is.

06:01.820 --> 06:02.820
Jesus.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.420
Hold on, this is an article, but there's got to be a video on this, right?

06:05.420 --> 06:06.420
Yeah, yeah, here it is.

06:06.420 --> 06:07.420
Let's check this out.

06:07.420 --> 06:08.420
Nope, no gun.

06:08.420 --> 06:09.420
Nerf gun.

06:09.420 --> 06:13.420
Nope, not even a Nerf gun.

06:13.820 --> 06:14.820
Nope.

06:14.820 --> 06:18.820
If your dad wants to get it for you, that's fine, but I can't bring it to you.

06:18.820 --> 06:19.820
But what else would you like?

06:19.820 --> 06:21.820
Lots of other toys.

06:21.820 --> 06:26.820
There's Legos, there's bicycles, there's cars and trucks.

06:26.820 --> 06:30.820
What do you think?

06:30.820 --> 06:33.820
What do you think?

06:33.820 --> 06:35.820
It's okay, buddy.

06:35.820 --> 06:36.820
It's okay.

06:36.820 --> 06:37.820
Your dad?

06:37.820 --> 06:40.420
Oh, come the fuck on, man.

06:40.420 --> 06:45.020
Well, it turns out that the mall Santa was actually fired, and the mall personally sent

06:45.020 --> 06:50.020
another Santa to the boy's house after the incident went viral on Facebook.

06:50.020 --> 06:53.020
And yes, the new Santa gave him his Nerf gun.

06:53.020 --> 06:56.020
There was a mistake made yesterday, huh?

06:56.020 --> 06:57.020
Yeah.

06:57.020 --> 06:59.020
Well, we're so sorry about that.

06:59.020 --> 07:00.020
Okay?

07:00.020 --> 07:05.020
Can Santa come in?

07:05.020 --> 07:08.020
This is big.

07:08.620 --> 07:16.620
But I heard you were coming to check on me from Elmer's house.

07:16.620 --> 07:19.620
Yo, I heard about this up at the North Pole.

07:19.620 --> 07:20.620
Yummy.

07:20.620 --> 07:22.620
And I rushed down the hill.

07:22.620 --> 07:25.620
But this is crazy.

07:25.620 --> 07:28.620
Listen for this.

07:28.620 --> 07:32.620
Wait.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.620
This is...

07:34.620 --> 07:37.620
It's just a Nerf gun.

07:38.220 --> 07:42.220
This is crazy, this thing.

07:42.220 --> 07:44.220
What did you say?

07:44.220 --> 07:46.220
Thanks.

07:46.220 --> 07:50.220
Well, thank you.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.220
It just seems to be incredible to me that we've gotten to this point, you know?

07:53.220 --> 07:58.220
Like that first article from 2013, it was played off as a joke.

07:58.220 --> 08:04.220
She went for the penguin route, because even back in 2013, everyone knew how ridiculous this was.

08:04.220 --> 08:07.220
How ridiculous it sounded to the average person.

08:07.820 --> 08:13.820
And here we are, 2020, and woke ass Santas are breaking kids' hearts by telling them they can't have toy guns.

08:13.820 --> 08:19.820
This post on Twitter went viral this year, where Richard Grinnell, someone who apparently worked for Trump, says

08:19.820 --> 08:23.820
stop voting for Democrats with a picture of a gingerbread person.

08:23.820 --> 08:26.820
And it's like, okay, yeah, fair enough, that's kind of stupid.

08:26.820 --> 08:29.820
Who really cares if it's called a gingerbread person?

08:29.820 --> 08:31.820
Like, yeah, we all get it.

08:31.820 --> 08:33.820
It's a gingerbread man.

08:33.820 --> 08:35.820
But does it really matter that much?

08:36.420 --> 08:39.420
I probably wouldn't buy it, but I wouldn't make a big deal about it.

08:39.420 --> 08:41.420
This is just a natural progression of the same ideas.

08:41.420 --> 08:48.420
Three years ago, gingerbread men were banned at the Scottish parliament as part of a new drive to stamp out sexism.

08:48.420 --> 08:51.420
A single data point is funny.

08:51.420 --> 08:53.420
It's a meme, it's a joke, it's a viral post.

08:53.420 --> 08:58.420
When you start to collect multiple data points, when you start to build a story,

08:58.420 --> 09:05.420
that's when you begin to realize that, oh, this isn't just some woke idiot who happens to be in a position of marginal power in one location.

09:06.020 --> 09:09.020
Gingerbread men are replaced by gingerbread persons in the Scottish parliament.

09:09.020 --> 09:13.020
The parliament coffee shop renamed the sweet treat in case it causes offense.

09:13.020 --> 09:20.020
A survey found 30% of women working in the Scottish parliament believe they had been sexually harassed.

09:20.020 --> 09:23.020
How do we get from gingerbread persons to sexual harassment?

09:23.020 --> 09:26.020
We went from 0 to 60 pretty fucking fast here.

09:26.020 --> 09:29.020
Listen, the Me Too movement just needs to be more inclusive, alright?

09:29.020 --> 09:33.020
It needs to be inclusive of victims of gingerbread men violence.

09:33.620 --> 09:37.620
An age-old question about Santa is tearing one parenting community apart.

09:37.620 --> 09:43.620
I love Christmas, but I have known for a long time that I probably wouldn't be up for maintaining a fiction around the existence of Santa Claus around child.

09:43.620 --> 09:45.620
I'm no good at on-the-spot fibbing.

09:45.620 --> 09:48.620
I've become extremely uncomfortable watching TV shows or reading books,

09:48.620 --> 09:50.620
where the plot revolves around people perpetuating long-term lies.

09:50.620 --> 09:52.620
And also, I simply do not like playing.

09:52.620 --> 09:54.620
I've always felt like a real Grinch about it.

09:54.620 --> 09:57.620
Who wouldn't want to give their child all those classic twinkly peppermint memories?

09:57.620 --> 10:00.620
One of my friends believed in Santa until she was 15

10:01.220 --> 10:04.220
because her parents doubled down when she asked multiple times over the years and she trusted them.

10:04.220 --> 10:08.220
She was beyond betrayed and mad and embarrassed when they finally admitted the truth.

10:08.220 --> 10:12.220
We didn't grow up believing in Santa because my mom was extremely poor as a kid and had a very traumatic upbringing

10:12.220 --> 10:15.220
and told us she never understood why some kids got gifts from Santa.

10:15.220 --> 10:17.220
And she tried to be so good and she never got one.

10:17.220 --> 10:19.220
It was really freaking depressing.

10:19.220 --> 10:20.220
See, I kind of get it, right?

10:20.220 --> 10:24.220
Like, I watched a recent video from Sargon over at the Lotus Eaters

10:24.220 --> 10:25.220
and they talked about Santa a little bit.

10:25.220 --> 10:27.220
It wasn't the main point, I don't think. I think it was just a side point.

10:27.220 --> 10:29.220
But I could be wrong. I might be misremembering it.

10:29.820 --> 10:32.820
But the point was, is that it's something magical for a child to believe in

10:32.820 --> 10:36.820
and if you expose them to the truth too early, you have basically ruined it for them.

10:36.820 --> 10:37.820
And that seems to be true.

10:37.820 --> 10:39.820
Kids do a lot of imaginary play.

10:39.820 --> 10:42.820
It doesn't even matter if they think it's truly real or not, at least for some kids.

10:42.820 --> 10:47.820
They do a lot of imaginary play and that's part of growing up, that's part of kind of learning what the world is.

10:47.820 --> 10:49.820
And so it's important to give them the space to engage in that.

10:49.820 --> 10:53.820
But at the same time, I recall being pretty young.

10:53.820 --> 10:58.820
And, you know, maybe my own memories are skewed on this because it was a while ago and I was a kid.

10:59.420 --> 11:02.420
I had very vivid memories of being doubtful of Santa.

11:02.420 --> 11:07.420
It didn't make sense to me that, you know, my Super Nintendo games had Made in Japan printed on them

11:07.420 --> 11:09.420
or were very clearly made by corporations.

11:09.420 --> 11:12.420
Like, they were like, how does Santa get around copyright?

11:12.420 --> 11:17.420
Why is it that all the depictions of the Santa experience are the elves building simplistic toys

11:17.420 --> 11:19.420
and not building complicated electronics?

11:19.420 --> 11:22.420
How did Santa fit down my house's very tiny chimney?

11:22.420 --> 11:24.420
You know, magic, magic, magic.

11:24.420 --> 11:28.420
But like, in other domains of life as a kid, you learn very quickly that magic doesn't exist.

11:29.020 --> 11:31.020
Like, your parents tell you, you know, magic isn't really real.

11:31.020 --> 11:33.020
But when it comes to Santa, it is.

11:33.020 --> 11:38.020
That's the one domain that your parents will generally say, no, magic is real.

11:38.020 --> 11:42.020
So I remember, even as a child, being at least a little bit rational and being like, well, this doesn't make any sense.

11:42.020 --> 11:47.020
Like, there's a lot of evidence that Santa isn't real and there's no evidence that he is, aside from my parents' word.

11:47.020 --> 11:52.020
And I remember being like, asking very honestly, probably younger than they expected,

11:52.620 --> 11:59.620
asking with the intention of getting a straight answer out of them and them saying, of course Santa's real.

11:59.620 --> 12:04.620
And when I finally came to my mom and I was like, you've just been lying this whole time, haven't you?

12:04.620 --> 12:06.620
And she admitted that she was.

12:06.620 --> 12:09.620
That was like the first time when I was like, I can't really trust my parents, can I?

12:09.620 --> 12:11.620
At least for some things.

12:11.620 --> 12:13.620
Like, it sounds kind of petty and ridiculous.

12:13.620 --> 12:15.620
Like, it's Santa. Like, who the fuck cares?

12:15.620 --> 12:16.620
Like, yeah, fair enough.

12:16.620 --> 12:18.620
I'm not like, holding this over their heads now that I'm an adult.

12:19.220 --> 12:24.220
But it was a realization of, like, the fact that your parents actually can just lie to you.

12:24.220 --> 12:31.220
And that doesn't mean that they don't care about you, but it does mean that you can't completely just listen to them blindly.

12:31.220 --> 12:37.220
And I guess for some kids, that's more or less traumatic an experience, depending on their temperament, when it happens, et cetera, et cetera.

12:37.220 --> 12:41.220
So, the people who say, you know, I don't want to break my kids' trust like that, I get it.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.220
It's not an illegitimate argument, I understand.

12:43.820 --> 12:48.820
And you know what? If you ever want to just lose faith in humanity, hop on Twitter and search for Santa and White Man.

12:48.820 --> 13:00.820
My Christmas spirit is coming from the fact that I'm in pre-production for a short film about the North Pole doing a diversity, equity, and inclusion overhaul, firing Santa because he's a cishet white man and replacing him with a black woman named Shaniqua.

13:00.820 --> 13:02.820
Yeah, Santa Inc. tried that and it fucking sucked.

13:02.820 --> 13:03.820
Save your money, dude.

13:03.820 --> 13:05.820
How long did y'all's parents let you believe in Santa?

13:05.820 --> 13:09.820
My mom was not going to let me believe a white man was giving us free stuff.

13:09.820 --> 13:11.820
Okay, that's pretty funny.

13:12.420 --> 13:19.420
My family had to tell me Santa wasn't real fast because I just didn't like the idea of an old white man watching me while I sleep used to cry every night in December.

13:19.420 --> 13:21.420
I'm never going to let my kids believe in Santa.

13:21.420 --> 13:24.420
Given a white man credit for something I did, I don't think so.

13:24.420 --> 13:29.420
My kids will know Santa Claus ain't real, ain't no fat white man taking credit for the work I put in.

13:29.420 --> 13:31.420
As a kid, I never believed in Santa.

13:31.420 --> 13:40.420
As a critical adult and former poor kid of color from the hood, I think it's insulting that an old white man take all the credit for the sacrifices and hustle my parents endured to give us what little they could.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.020
Also, hold the fuck on.

13:45.020 --> 13:46.020
How black are you?

13:46.020 --> 13:49.020
I haven't been able to concentrate or be productive in months.

13:49.020 --> 13:51.020
Like, I've gotten zero work done.

13:51.020 --> 13:53.020
Am I the only one experiencing this? What's wrong with me?

13:53.020 --> 13:59.020
Don't worry, you're a sociology PhD candidate specializing in race, ethnicity, and ethnic studies.

13:59.020 --> 14:02.020
I don't think the labor demands on your field are that high anyway.

14:02.020 --> 14:04.020
Brown, Santa, everything.

14:04.020 --> 14:10.020
How many years has my 70 plus year old father only seen Santa and Jesus portrayed as a white man?

14:10.620 --> 14:11.620
Not anymore.

14:11.620 --> 14:14.620
I'm almost more excited to give him these gift bags than his actual gifts.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.620
Representation matters at every age, at all times.

14:16.620 --> 14:21.620
It's the universalized utopian representation for all people in all eras.

14:21.620 --> 14:23.620
Wait a minute, this person doesn't even look black.

14:23.620 --> 14:24.620
Like, hold on.

14:26.620 --> 14:27.620
I mean, we'd be kind of brown.

14:27.620 --> 14:29.620
Hold on, let's check out this picture here.

14:30.620 --> 14:31.620
Oh, it's a video.

14:31.620 --> 14:38.620
Racialized individuals cannot permanently regulate our nervous system in a society that is not permanently safe.

14:39.220 --> 14:42.220
So, many Western trauma professionals...

14:46.220 --> 14:47.220
Hold on.

14:47.220 --> 14:53.220
Are you making the claim that racialized people, you lack the ability to regulate your nervous system?

14:53.220 --> 14:56.220
It has to be constant, right? Because no society is permanently safe.

14:56.220 --> 14:59.220
You can't make a society permanently safe for anyone.

14:59.220 --> 15:01.220
There's always going to be that outside danger.

15:01.220 --> 15:02.220
There's always going to be inside danger.

15:02.220 --> 15:05.220
There does not exist the absolutely safe society.

15:05.820 --> 15:11.820
So, are you saying that by virtue of your race, you are unable to control yourself?

15:11.820 --> 15:13.820
I don't think you want to go down this road, dude.

15:14.820 --> 15:20.820
In any case, that slow cultural creep, the rot that is infecting everything, is in fact coming for Santa.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.820
And it has been slowly coming for Santa this entire time.

15:23.820 --> 15:29.820
I'm not going to sit here and tell you that there's a war on Christmas, the way that, like, Donald Trump said or something.

15:29.820 --> 15:32.820
It's not offensive to see a white Santa walking around.

15:33.420 --> 15:35.420
It's also really not offensive to see a black Santa walking around.

15:35.420 --> 15:37.420
Or even a woman Santa. It doesn't matter.

15:37.420 --> 15:39.420
It just doesn't matter.

15:39.420 --> 15:50.420
But the point seems to be that there is this hatred that is spewing out at the West's cultural institutions that we have long considered to be common and positive.

15:50.420 --> 15:54.420
The fact that they are ours, that they're normalized here specifically.

15:54.420 --> 16:01.420
There is a contingent of people who are just hell-bent on hating everything normative.

16:02.020 --> 16:06.020
But here, here is the truly 180 IQ take.

16:06.020 --> 16:08.020
You know how Santa knows when you're sleeping?

16:08.020 --> 16:10.020
He knows when you're awake.

16:10.020 --> 16:12.020
He judges you based on being naughty or nice.

16:12.020 --> 16:14.020
How does he know all that information, dude?

16:14.020 --> 16:20.020
Have we been acclimating our kids all this time to the idea that they're constantly being spied on by Santa?

16:20.020 --> 16:22.020
The Santa myth, oh my god, guys.

16:22.020 --> 16:28.020
The Santa myth has been a way of getting our children to be okay with the surveillance state.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.620
Santa and the NSA?

16:30.620 --> 16:32.620
It's like a hand fitting into a well-made glove.

16:32.620 --> 16:34.620
I can't believe it.

16:34.620 --> 16:36.620
I've deduced the mystery.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.620
I've discovered what's truly going on.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.620
If you truly want to save your kids from this, guys.

16:40.620 --> 16:42.620
You gotta head out there.

16:42.620 --> 16:44.620
You gotta get all the tinfoil you can muster.

16:44.620 --> 16:46.620
And you gotta start building anti-Santa barriers around your property.

16:46.620 --> 16:49.620
And let those little fuckers know that Santa ain't visiting this year.

16:49.620 --> 16:51.620
Alright, guys.

16:51.620 --> 16:53.620
Have a good Christmas. I love you.

16:58.620 --> 17:03.620
Merry Christmas!

17:03.620 --> 17:05.620
Oh, Santa took off!
