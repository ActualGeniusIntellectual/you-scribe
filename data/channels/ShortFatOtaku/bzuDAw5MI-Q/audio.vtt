00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
Why is the idea of preparation nowadays frowned upon?

00:03.280 --> 00:06.640
Before, the idea was that it was a good idea to save for a rainy day.

00:06.640 --> 00:09.360
Like a squirrel packing away nuts for the winter or something.

00:09.360 --> 00:13.200
You would work hard here and now so that you wouldn't have to work hard later

00:13.200 --> 00:18.160
when working hard would either one, be impossible, or two, be significantly harder.

00:18.160 --> 00:21.760
But nowadays, the idea of preparation just seems to be a joke, doesn't it?

00:21.760 --> 00:25.520
When you think of a prepper, you think of some guy wearing a tinfoil hat and a gas mask,

00:25.520 --> 00:27.840
sitting in the bunker that he built in his own backyard,

00:27.840 --> 00:32.320
fiddling with a ham radio and eating an MRE beside a giant pile of guns and ammo.

00:32.320 --> 00:36.320
And people like that are considered by the mainstream to be conspiracy theorist nutjobs.

00:36.320 --> 00:39.920
Of course, some of them probably actually are conspiracy theorist nutjobs,

00:39.920 --> 00:45.680
like those people that tried to do prep by buying 552 cans of Mountain Dew.

00:58.640 --> 00:59.600
Oh, it's a Mountain Dew.

00:59.600 --> 01:26.880
I

01:26.880 --> 01:29.120
guess these are just the parents of Movie Bob?

01:29.120 --> 01:33.280
But certainly not all people who prepare for a disaster are conspiracy theorists.

01:33.280 --> 01:38.080
That's why you get comments like this from Mother Jones, who obviously lie through their teeth.

01:38.080 --> 01:42.000
The only conservatives who took COVID-19 seriously were the conspiracy theorists.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.600
This is demonstrably false.

01:43.600 --> 01:47.200
Regardless of how you feel about Tucker Carlson, he's hit or miss for me.

01:47.200 --> 01:52.160
Here's him back in January urging his viewers to pay attention to the coronavirus.

01:52.160 --> 01:56.560
In America's newsroom, impeachment is all that matters and that should tell you something.

01:57.040 --> 01:59.200
In fact, it ought to make you suspicious.

01:59.200 --> 02:04.160
The world is changing incredibly fast out there and it's fascinating and ominous

02:04.160 --> 02:05.120
and worth covering.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.600
But by and large, the media are all but ignoring it.

02:07.600 --> 02:08.720
Why are they doing that?

02:09.360 --> 02:14.400
Well, consider the stories they're downplaying in favor of a protracted government hearing

02:14.400 --> 02:15.760
whose ending we already know.

02:16.400 --> 02:20.640
For starters, at this very moment, a serious viral outbreak is spreading across China,

02:20.640 --> 02:21.680
the world's biggest country.

02:22.240 --> 02:27.760
In just a matter of weeks, this new strain of coronavirus has generated almost as many

02:27.760 --> 02:29.280
new cases as SARS did.

02:29.280 --> 02:30.080
Remember SARS?

02:30.720 --> 02:32.640
As SARS did in three full months.

02:32.640 --> 02:37.920
I would not call Tucker Carlson a conspiracy theorist, just a regular conservative pundit.

02:37.920 --> 02:41.760
But the image of the tinfoil hat wearing nutjob is an evocative one.

02:41.760 --> 02:45.920
And I'm not surprised that there are elements of the radical left that have taken to using

02:45.920 --> 02:50.000
that image to bludgeon all people they disagree with, as always.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.080
For example, think back a few months.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.000
Whether you're conservative or not doesn't really matter.

02:54.560 --> 02:58.800
If you voiced to, say, your friends or maybe some people you know online who are relatively

02:58.800 --> 03:03.600
apolitical your concerns about the coronavirus, did you get called a conspiracy theorist?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.120
Even if you're not a conservative at all?

03:05.680 --> 03:07.600
You probably did, at least by somebody.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.040
Did you get called a racist?

03:09.680 --> 03:10.960
Yeah, probably.

03:10.960 --> 03:14.080
There's no way we all have that bad of a memory, right?

03:14.080 --> 03:21.280
Like, I can understand some people not understanding, say, the 2008 election or the 2004 election

03:21.280 --> 03:25.440
or the 2000 election or, like, that previous era of politics where it was dominated by

03:25.440 --> 03:26.720
the Bushes and the Clintons.

03:26.720 --> 03:32.240
I can actually forgive some really young people who truly believe that Trump is the worst

03:32.240 --> 03:36.800
thing to ever happen to the world because they're too young to remember or understand

03:36.800 --> 03:41.120
the devastating impact of the second Iraq war and Bush's cowboy diplomacy.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.760
Or even Obama's neoliberal backstabbery.

03:43.840 --> 03:44.720
I get it, man.

03:44.720 --> 03:48.720
I was a kid in the early 90s, but I don't remember the politics of that era personally.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.720
But really, three months.

03:51.520 --> 03:54.800
You guys can't remember the stuff you were saying three months ago.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.360
This is from January 28th of this year.

03:57.360 --> 04:00.800
Ontario School Board warns that coronavirus concerns

04:00.800 --> 04:02.960
veer into anti-Chinese racism.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.040
No one's publishing garbage like this now.

04:05.040 --> 04:08.640
Before coronavirus hit our shores, it was all, don't be racist.

04:08.640 --> 04:09.600
Don't be a bigot.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.800
You're a Trump-loving cinephobe if you stock up for a potential pandemic.

04:12.800 --> 04:16.560
Or if you don't go down to your local Chinese restaurant and eat the bat soup or something.

04:16.560 --> 04:20.240
Reading this stuff almost makes me feel like I'm looking back at a different era.

04:20.240 --> 04:26.240
The mayor of Florence, Italy initiated Hug a Chinese on Twitter on February 1st.

04:26.240 --> 04:29.920
Opposing anger towards China amid the coronavirus outbreak

04:29.920 --> 04:32.000
and calling for unity in this common battle.

04:33.200 --> 04:33.700
Yeah?

04:34.480 --> 04:35.760
How did that work out for Italy?

04:36.480 --> 04:39.760
I'm not saying that hugging a Chinese person is wrong, obviously,

04:39.760 --> 04:42.000
or that it caused the outbreak or that it exacerbated it.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.880
I'm saying that people who spent their time virtue signaling rather than preparing

04:46.880 --> 04:49.600
found themselves up shit creek without a paddle.

04:50.160 --> 04:50.880
So what happened?

04:51.520 --> 04:54.800
When did it stop being virtuous to plan ahead for your future?

04:54.800 --> 04:56.720
I think I've seen this brewing for a while, to be honest.

04:57.440 --> 05:01.280
When I was younger, I was as reliable as I could be.

05:01.280 --> 05:03.200
I'm still as reliable as I can be now.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.320
You can always get better at that.

05:04.320 --> 05:08.640
But like, basically what I mean is, when I said I would do something, I would do it.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.400
When I said I would be somewhere, I would be there.

05:11.120 --> 05:13.520
And I held other people to that same standard.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.560
And I was told in my early 20s that I was being unreasonable.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.880
You know, that if someone says, yeah, I'll be there at four and then they're there at six

05:20.880 --> 05:24.720
or they just don't show up at all and they just apologize about it three days later.

05:24.720 --> 05:29.200
That pissed me off because my time is valuable and I don't want to waste it dicking around.

05:29.200 --> 05:32.640
But apparently I was being unreasonable, holding others to a standard.

05:32.640 --> 05:36.560
I wasn't being understanding or I was being too rigid or I was not

05:36.560 --> 05:39.440
understanding the power of spontaneity or something.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.160
Like, there was a lot of excuses people gave for this, but at the end of the day,

05:42.160 --> 05:44.320
it was just flaky people being flaky.

05:44.320 --> 05:50.480
And I think that that has gone from, like, an obvious character detriment to something

05:50.480 --> 05:55.040
that people hold on to as part of their personality because they think that their

05:55.040 --> 05:59.520
quirks make them who they are, which really, that isn't how personality works.

05:59.520 --> 06:03.520
Most people who say they have a quirky personality, what that means is they have a

06:03.520 --> 06:06.400
bunch of flaws that they haven't actually done the hard work of getting rid of.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.840
And they're making excuses about it by saying that, oh, they're just lol so random.

06:09.840 --> 06:13.920
And even though I'm talking about a personal and interpersonal thing here,

06:13.920 --> 06:16.640
I think it does actually push into the realm of politics

06:16.640 --> 06:19.360
as far as social justice ideology is concerned.

06:19.360 --> 06:23.520
Because again, if we're going to go back to the whole valueless postmodernism thing,

06:23.520 --> 06:26.960
why is being on time any better than not being on time?

06:26.960 --> 06:30.400
If there can be no value judgments, then both of those options are the same.

06:30.400 --> 06:34.000
And that does bleed over into things like being prepared.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.920
According to this lens, there is no value difference between preparing for the future

06:37.920 --> 06:41.520
and not preparing for the future. Therefore, there's only moral judgment.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.640
Does your preparation out you as a tinfoil hat wearing nutcase?

06:45.280 --> 06:49.120
Or, alternatively, a racist? That's the only question that they're concerned with.

06:49.120 --> 06:53.120
And so, when the seriousness of a situation finally collapses in on these people and

06:53.120 --> 06:57.840
they've done no preparation at all, they, too, find themselves up shit creek.

06:57.840 --> 07:01.920
Gone are the days of the victory garden, where the main reason people grew food in

07:01.920 --> 07:05.280
their own backyard was because they actually had to feed their family

07:05.280 --> 07:07.600
during a war where food was in short supply.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.560
And this was promoted both through the government and culturally,

07:10.560 --> 07:14.720
because it also drove food prices down, meaning that food was actually cheaper

07:14.720 --> 07:17.760
for the US government to buy and therefore feed their troops with.

07:17.760 --> 07:21.760
Not only backyards, but public spaces became gardens

07:21.760 --> 07:24.480
because it was a crisis situation and everyone had to pitch in.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.320
Compare this with the coronavirus situation.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.840
If you told people three months ago that you were considering planting a garden in the spring

07:29.840 --> 07:32.400
because of coronavirus and because you didn't know how much food there would be,

07:32.400 --> 07:33.920
if there would be shortages or whatever,

07:33.920 --> 07:36.480
they would look at you like you had your head on backwards.

07:36.480 --> 07:40.000
But now, after planting season is already well underway in the United States,

07:40.000 --> 07:42.480
all of these people who are perpetually late to the game

07:42.480 --> 07:44.720
are now scrambling to try and plant gardens.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.840
This is all topped off by the fact that some governments and jurisdictions

07:48.400 --> 07:52.960
are banning the sale of seeds and gardening supplies because they're not necessary.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.720
How ridiculous is this?

07:54.720 --> 07:56.320
You're allowed to go out to the grocery store,

07:56.320 --> 07:59.360
where there's a whole bunch of other people who might be transmitting the virus,

07:59.440 --> 08:02.000
get groceries, which might be infected with the virus,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.720
and do this repeatedly as you need more food,

08:04.720 --> 08:07.120
being entirely dependent on the supply chain.

08:07.120 --> 08:12.000
But when it comes to buying seeds and growing your own for the remainder of the sunny season,

08:12.000 --> 08:12.800
nope, can't do it.

08:12.800 --> 08:17.360
You think a one-time purchase of seeds and then going out to the grocery store a lot less

08:17.360 --> 08:20.880
would be a lot more social distancing than constant grocery trips.

08:20.880 --> 08:24.640
But as it turns out, gardening itself is a form of preparation.

08:24.640 --> 08:27.120
You're not just going to the store and getting what you need.

08:27.600 --> 08:31.440
You're planting, investing, waiting a month, two months, three months,

08:31.440 --> 08:33.840
however long it takes to start getting your vegetables.

08:33.840 --> 08:37.600
And if the goal is to break the self-sufficiency of people who prepare

08:37.600 --> 08:40.800
and force them to be entirely dependent on the supply chain,

08:40.800 --> 08:43.200
the structure of the state and the corporation,

08:43.200 --> 08:46.560
this is exactly the kind of thing that you would do during a crisis.

08:46.560 --> 08:51.840
It almost seems like in our mad scramble for safety, we've killed ourselves.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.280
We killed ourselves from fear.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.440
We became so self-centered that we thought we would never die.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.080
And with this immortality just within our grasp,

09:03.360 --> 09:07.120
any possible threat of death, however remote or unlikely,

09:07.120 --> 09:09.440
became the thing that paralyzed us.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.680
And I'm not saying that fear of death is a bad thing.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.120
I'm not even saying that it's unreasonable.

09:13.120 --> 09:13.920
I get it.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.840
For an atheist like me, where there's nothing after death,

09:18.880 --> 09:20.880
death is the scariest thing.

09:20.880 --> 09:24.480
It means that on some level the world is just a trapping,

09:24.480 --> 09:26.400
and for each and every single one of us,

09:26.400 --> 09:29.520
behind all of this lies our own personal apocalypse.

09:29.520 --> 09:32.720
But does fear of death justify cowardice to such an extent

09:32.720 --> 09:34.800
that life is no longer worth living?

09:34.800 --> 09:39.040
Are people truly so weak that when a crisis finally comes for them,

09:39.040 --> 09:41.920
they run crying towards any authority they can?

09:41.920 --> 09:44.000
The state, corporations, doesn't matter.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.480
Screaming, please, I'll give you anything.

09:46.480 --> 09:47.600
Just save me.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.600
I don't care what quality of life I have.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.280
I don't care how terrible it is.

09:51.280 --> 09:52.800
Just keep me from death.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.400
We always like to make fun of the radical left

09:54.400 --> 09:56.160
and how they keep bringing up Harry Potter,

09:56.160 --> 09:58.480
you know, years and years after the series has ended.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.240
We always say read another book.

10:00.240 --> 10:02.320
But considering that they love it so much,

10:02.320 --> 10:04.320
you think they would have understood the core lessons

10:04.320 --> 10:05.840
those books had to teach us.

10:05.840 --> 10:08.560
Voldemort is a tyrant because he fears dying.

10:08.560 --> 10:11.600
He even says nothing is worse than death.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.160
His inner circle is named the Death Eaters,

10:14.160 --> 10:16.400
basically a group of people who are so hopped up

10:16.400 --> 10:18.160
on their own arrogance and importance

10:18.160 --> 10:20.160
that they believe that they are above death,

10:20.160 --> 10:21.840
specifically that they're so far above it

10:21.840 --> 10:22.880
that it's like food to them,

10:22.880 --> 10:25.040
the same way that animals are food to humans.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.520
Meanwhile, Harry Potter, the hero of the story,

10:27.520 --> 10:29.280
recognizes death as being evil,

10:29.280 --> 10:31.200
but not as the paramount evil.

10:31.200 --> 10:34.560
That there are worse things that you can do while alive than die.

10:34.560 --> 10:38.640
And that when it comes time for somebody to simply die naturally,

10:38.640 --> 10:40.480
that death is not evil at all,

10:40.480 --> 10:42.000
but is in fact a companion,

10:42.640 --> 10:44.880
one that none of us will ever escape.

10:44.880 --> 10:45.840
When Trump got elected,

10:45.840 --> 10:48.720
they always viewed themselves as the heroes of that story.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.760
But when death finally seriously reared its ugly head

10:51.760 --> 10:53.360
within their lives for the first time,

10:53.360 --> 10:54.720
they all became Voldemort,

10:54.720 --> 10:56.800
or at the very least Voldemort's lackeys.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.080
The honest truth is,

10:58.080 --> 11:00.320
I don't even think the virus is that bad.

11:00.320 --> 11:01.920
Yes, people are dying,

11:01.920 --> 11:03.520
but more people die of the flu.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.640
Hell, more people die of heat stroke during the summer.

11:06.640 --> 11:07.600
And despite that,

11:07.600 --> 11:10.720
not having air conditioning isn't exactly illegal or anything.

11:10.720 --> 11:13.200
We consider these things like the heat or the flu

11:13.200 --> 11:16.560
or even cancer or other major medical problems

11:16.560 --> 11:18.640
as things that yes, they need to be fought,

11:18.640 --> 11:21.840
but they are not worth destroying our society in order to fight them.

11:21.840 --> 11:23.920
And the coronavirus should be the same way.

11:23.920 --> 11:27.040
I think the mortality rate of the coronavirus is actually a lot lower.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.480
I've been saying this for a while now.

11:28.480 --> 11:32.320
I think the virus has mutated into an asymptomatic variant

11:32.320 --> 11:34.480
that has been at least partially inoculating

11:34.480 --> 11:37.680
large swaths of the population without anybody even recognizing it.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.440
And the reason that I think this is yes,

11:39.440 --> 11:40.560
that Icelandic study,

11:40.560 --> 11:43.600
there are other studies coming out now of like Italy, South Korea, Spain,

11:43.600 --> 11:45.440
even China, for all the good that'll do us.

11:45.440 --> 11:46.480
But my point is,

11:46.480 --> 11:50.160
when you compare jurisdictions that have completely locked everything down

11:50.160 --> 11:52.960
and turned into complete totalitarian nightmare states

11:52.960 --> 11:54.960
and other locations that have not really done anything,

11:54.960 --> 11:58.320
the decline in the acceleration of cases is identical.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.160
And that tells me that the number of people

12:00.160 --> 12:03.040
who are still capable of being infected is dropping.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.440
And that means inoculation.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.800
It sounds kind of strange actually,

12:06.800 --> 12:09.680
but Boris Johnson's idea of herd immunity was probably correct.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.200
But to tie this all together,

12:11.200 --> 12:15.120
I think the reason that preparedness is now frowned upon when it once wasn't

12:15.120 --> 12:19.200
is because preparedness shows people who don't prepare that they're vulnerable,

12:19.200 --> 12:23.040
that society may not always function exactly the way that it currently does.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.440
And they don't like to be woken up to that fact.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.960
And in the more extreme cases,

12:26.960 --> 12:29.040
they don't like to be reminded of their own mortality.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.800
Back in January when somebody was saying,

12:30.800 --> 12:33.520
I'm going to buy six months worth of food, like me,

12:33.520 --> 12:36.000
because there might be a problem in the future and I don't starve.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.960
Yes, we were all called racists and conspiracy theorists.

12:38.960 --> 12:44.720
But we were called those names by people who had such unwavering faith in the system,

12:44.720 --> 12:48.240
not because the system itself is stable, even though it is stable,

12:48.240 --> 12:52.080
but because they don't want to look into the abyss of their own personal apocalypse,

12:52.080 --> 12:54.560
because they fear death so much

12:55.200 --> 12:59.520
that even the idea that death will one day come for them is offensive.

12:59.520 --> 13:02.640
So they would rather shame you into being ignorant the way that they are.

13:02.640 --> 13:04.800
And then when it can no longer be ignored,

13:04.800 --> 13:07.520
when the gravity of the situation finally reaches them,

13:07.520 --> 13:10.720
they switch from insulting you for being prepared

13:10.720 --> 13:15.360
to being willing to sign their soul away just for one extra breath.

13:15.360 --> 13:16.640
To me, it's not worth it.

13:16.640 --> 13:20.480
I'm not acting like those dumb spring break partiers who are saying,

13:20.480 --> 13:23.360
Oh, well, if I get the coronavirus, I get it. Who cares? I'm going to party.

13:23.360 --> 13:27.200
I'm not acting like those people who don't believe that it exists and are saying,

13:27.200 --> 13:29.040
whatever, I'll just go out and live my life regularly.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.000
Then they end up dying.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.880
I'm not saying don't practice social distancing.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.200
Don't wear masks if you feel like you need one,

13:35.200 --> 13:37.920
because those are also forms of preparedness as well.

13:37.920 --> 13:42.160
What I am saying is that the facade of eternal life that we've all been living,

13:42.160 --> 13:46.400
because we're all relatively young and in relatively prosperous countries,

13:46.400 --> 13:51.440
maintaining that facade at all costs is not worth giving up our liberty.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.160
In all likelihood, this will happen again within our lifetimes.

13:54.160 --> 13:57.200
Maybe not a disease, but some kind of emergency situation.

13:57.200 --> 14:01.520
And if you feel the need to prepare for something, for anything, do it.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.760
And don't let anyone shame you into not doing it,

14:03.760 --> 14:07.840
because in their shaming, they are revealing themselves to be a coward.

14:07.840 --> 14:10.560
And your attempt at confronting the future problem

14:10.560 --> 14:14.400
as forthrightly as you can will always be offensive to a coward.
