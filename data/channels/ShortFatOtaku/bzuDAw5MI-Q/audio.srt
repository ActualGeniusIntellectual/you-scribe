1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Why is the idea of preparation nowadays frowned upon?

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,640
Before, the idea was that it was a good idea to save for a rainy day.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,360
Like a squirrel packing away nuts for the winter or something.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,200
You would work hard here and now so that you wouldn't have to work hard later

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,160
when working hard would either one, be impossible, or two, be significantly harder.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,760
But nowadays, the idea of preparation just seems to be a joke, doesn't it?

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,520
When you think of a prepper, you think of some guy wearing a tinfoil hat and a gas mask,

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,840
sitting in the bunker that he built in his own backyard,

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,320
fiddling with a ham radio and eating an MRE beside a giant pile of guns and ammo.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,320
And people like that are considered by the mainstream to be conspiracy theorist nutjobs.

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,920
Of course, some of them probably actually are conspiracy theorist nutjobs,

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,680
like those people that tried to do prep by buying 552 cans of Mountain Dew.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,600
Oh, it's a Mountain Dew.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:26,880
I

15
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,120
guess these are just the parents of Movie Bob?

16
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,280
But certainly not all people who prepare for a disaster are conspiracy theorists.

17
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,080
That's why you get comments like this from Mother Jones, who obviously lie through their teeth.

18
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,000
The only conservatives who took COVID-19 seriously were the conspiracy theorists.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,600
This is demonstrably false.

20
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,200
Regardless of how you feel about Tucker Carlson, he's hit or miss for me.

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,160
Here's him back in January urging his viewers to pay attention to the coronavirus.

22
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,560
In America's newsroom, impeachment is all that matters and that should tell you something.

23
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,200
In fact, it ought to make you suspicious.

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,160
The world is changing incredibly fast out there and it's fascinating and ominous

25
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,120
and worth covering.

26
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,600
But by and large, the media are all but ignoring it.

27
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,720
Why are they doing that?

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,400
Well, consider the stories they're downplaying in favor of a protracted government hearing

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,760
whose ending we already know.

30
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,640
For starters, at this very moment, a serious viral outbreak is spreading across China,

31
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,680
the world's biggest country.

32
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,760
In just a matter of weeks, this new strain of coronavirus has generated almost as many

33
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,280
new cases as SARS did.

34
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,080
Remember SARS?

35
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,640
As SARS did in three full months.

36
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,920
I would not call Tucker Carlson a conspiracy theorist, just a regular conservative pundit.

37
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,760
But the image of the tinfoil hat wearing nutjob is an evocative one.

38
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,920
And I'm not surprised that there are elements of the radical left that have taken to using

39
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,000
that image to bludgeon all people they disagree with, as always.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,080
For example, think back a few months.

41
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,000
Whether you're conservative or not doesn't really matter.

42
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,800
If you voiced to, say, your friends or maybe some people you know online who are relatively

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,600
apolitical your concerns about the coronavirus, did you get called a conspiracy theorist?

44
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,120
Even if you're not a conservative at all?

45
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,600
You probably did, at least by somebody.

46
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,040
Did you get called a racist?

47
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,960
Yeah, probably.

48
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,080
There's no way we all have that bad of a memory, right?

49
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,280
Like, I can understand some people not understanding, say, the 2008 election or the 2004 election

50
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,440
or the 2000 election or, like, that previous era of politics where it was dominated by

51
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,720
the Bushes and the Clintons.

52
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,240
I can actually forgive some really young people who truly believe that Trump is the worst

53
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,800
thing to ever happen to the world because they're too young to remember or understand

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,120
the devastating impact of the second Iraq war and Bush's cowboy diplomacy.

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,760
Or even Obama's neoliberal backstabbery.

56
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,720
I get it, man.

57
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,720
I was a kid in the early 90s, but I don't remember the politics of that era personally.

58
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
But really, three months.

59
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,800
You guys can't remember the stuff you were saying three months ago.

60
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,360
This is from January 28th of this year.

61
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,800
Ontario School Board warns that coronavirus concerns

62
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,960
veer into anti-Chinese racism.

63
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,040
No one's publishing garbage like this now.

64
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,640
Before coronavirus hit our shores, it was all, don't be racist.

65
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,600
Don't be a bigot.

66
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,800
You're a Trump-loving cinephobe if you stock up for a potential pandemic.

67
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,560
Or if you don't go down to your local Chinese restaurant and eat the bat soup or something.

68
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,240
Reading this stuff almost makes me feel like I'm looking back at a different era.

69
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:26,240
The mayor of Florence, Italy initiated Hug a Chinese on Twitter on February 1st.

70
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,920
Opposing anger towards China amid the coronavirus outbreak

71
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,000
and calling for unity in this common battle.

72
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,700
Yeah?

73
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,760
How did that work out for Italy?

74
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,760
I'm not saying that hugging a Chinese person is wrong, obviously,

75
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,000
or that it caused the outbreak or that it exacerbated it.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,880
I'm saying that people who spent their time virtue signaling rather than preparing

77
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,600
found themselves up shit creek without a paddle.

78
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,880
So what happened?

79
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,800
When did it stop being virtuous to plan ahead for your future?

80
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,720
I think I've seen this brewing for a while, to be honest.

81
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,280
When I was younger, I was as reliable as I could be.

82
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,200
I'm still as reliable as I can be now.

83
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,320
You can always get better at that.

84
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,640
But like, basically what I mean is, when I said I would do something, I would do it.

85
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,400
When I said I would be somewhere, I would be there.

86
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,520
And I held other people to that same standard.

87
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,560
And I was told in my early 20s that I was being unreasonable.

88
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,880
You know, that if someone says, yeah, I'll be there at four and then they're there at six

89
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,720
or they just don't show up at all and they just apologize about it three days later.

90
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,200
That pissed me off because my time is valuable and I don't want to waste it dicking around.

91
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,640
But apparently I was being unreasonable, holding others to a standard.

92
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,560
I wasn't being understanding or I was being too rigid or I was not

93
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,440
understanding the power of spontaneity or something.

94
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,160
Like, there was a lot of excuses people gave for this, but at the end of the day,

95
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,320
it was just flaky people being flaky.

96
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,480
And I think that that has gone from, like, an obvious character detriment to something

97
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,040
that people hold on to as part of their personality because they think that their

98
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,520
quirks make them who they are, which really, that isn't how personality works.

99
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,520
Most people who say they have a quirky personality, what that means is they have a

100
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,400
bunch of flaws that they haven't actually done the hard work of getting rid of.

101
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,840
And they're making excuses about it by saying that, oh, they're just lol so random.

102
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,920
And even though I'm talking about a personal and interpersonal thing here,

103
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,640
I think it does actually push into the realm of politics

104
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,360
as far as social justice ideology is concerned.

105
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,520
Because again, if we're going to go back to the whole valueless postmodernism thing,

106
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,960
why is being on time any better than not being on time?

107
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,400
If there can be no value judgments, then both of those options are the same.

108
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,000
And that does bleed over into things like being prepared.

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,920
According to this lens, there is no value difference between preparing for the future

110
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,520
and not preparing for the future. Therefore, there's only moral judgment.

111
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,640
Does your preparation out you as a tinfoil hat wearing nutcase?

112
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,120
Or, alternatively, a racist? That's the only question that they're concerned with.

113
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,120
And so, when the seriousness of a situation finally collapses in on these people and

114
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,840
they've done no preparation at all, they, too, find themselves up shit creek.

115
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,920
Gone are the days of the victory garden, where the main reason people grew food in

116
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,280
their own backyard was because they actually had to feed their family

117
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,600
during a war where food was in short supply.

118
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,560
And this was promoted both through the government and culturally,

119
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,720
because it also drove food prices down, meaning that food was actually cheaper

120
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,760
for the US government to buy and therefore feed their troops with.

121
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,760
Not only backyards, but public spaces became gardens

122
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,480
because it was a crisis situation and everyone had to pitch in.

123
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,320
Compare this with the coronavirus situation.

124
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,840
If you told people three months ago that you were considering planting a garden in the spring

125
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,400
because of coronavirus and because you didn't know how much food there would be,

126
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,920
if there would be shortages or whatever,

127
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,480
they would look at you like you had your head on backwards.

128
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,000
But now, after planting season is already well underway in the United States,

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,480
all of these people who are perpetually late to the game

130
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,720
are now scrambling to try and plant gardens.

131
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,840
This is all topped off by the fact that some governments and jurisdictions

132
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,960
are banning the sale of seeds and gardening supplies because they're not necessary.

133
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,720
How ridiculous is this?

134
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,320
You're allowed to go out to the grocery store,

135
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,360
where there's a whole bunch of other people who might be transmitting the virus,

136
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,000
get groceries, which might be infected with the virus,

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,720
and do this repeatedly as you need more food,

138
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,120
being entirely dependent on the supply chain.

139
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,000
But when it comes to buying seeds and growing your own for the remainder of the sunny season,

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,800
nope, can't do it.

141
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,360
You think a one-time purchase of seeds and then going out to the grocery store a lot less

142
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,880
would be a lot more social distancing than constant grocery trips.

143
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,640
But as it turns out, gardening itself is a form of preparation.

144
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,120
You're not just going to the store and getting what you need.

145
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,440
You're planting, investing, waiting a month, two months, three months,

146
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,840
however long it takes to start getting your vegetables.

147
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,600
And if the goal is to break the self-sufficiency of people who prepare

148
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,800
and force them to be entirely dependent on the supply chain,

149
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,200
the structure of the state and the corporation,

150
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,560
this is exactly the kind of thing that you would do during a crisis.

151
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,840
It almost seems like in our mad scramble for safety, we've killed ourselves.

152
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,280
We killed ourselves from fear.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,440
We became so self-centered that we thought we would never die.

154
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,080
And with this immortality just within our grasp,

155
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,120
any possible threat of death, however remote or unlikely,

156
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,440
became the thing that paralyzed us.

157
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,680
And I'm not saying that fear of death is a bad thing.

158
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,120
I'm not even saying that it's unreasonable.

159
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,920
I get it.

160
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,840
For an atheist like me, where there's nothing after death,

161
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
death is the scariest thing.

162
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,480
It means that on some level the world is just a trapping,

163
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,400
and for each and every single one of us,

164
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,520
behind all of this lies our own personal apocalypse.

165
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,720
But does fear of death justify cowardice to such an extent

166
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,800
that life is no longer worth living?

167
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,040
Are people truly so weak that when a crisis finally comes for them,

168
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,920
they run crying towards any authority they can?

169
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,000
The state, corporations, doesn't matter.

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,480
Screaming, please, I'll give you anything.

171
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,600
Just save me.

172
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I don't care what quality of life I have.

173
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,280
I don't care how terrible it is.

174
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,800
Just keep me from death.

175
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,400
We always like to make fun of the radical left

176
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,160
and how they keep bringing up Harry Potter,

177
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,480
you know, years and years after the series has ended.

178
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,240
We always say read another book.

179
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,320
But considering that they love it so much,

180
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
you think they would have understood the core lessons

181
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,840
those books had to teach us.

182
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,560
Voldemort is a tyrant because he fears dying.

183
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,600
He even says nothing is worse than death.

184
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,160
His inner circle is named the Death Eaters,

185
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,400
basically a group of people who are so hopped up

186
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,160
on their own arrogance and importance

187
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,160
that they believe that they are above death,

188
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,840
specifically that they're so far above it

189
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,880
that it's like food to them,

190
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,040
the same way that animals are food to humans.

191
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,520
Meanwhile, Harry Potter, the hero of the story,

192
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,280
recognizes death as being evil,

193
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,200
but not as the paramount evil.

194
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,560
That there are worse things that you can do while alive than die.

195
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,640
And that when it comes time for somebody to simply die naturally,

196
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,480
that death is not evil at all,

197
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,000
but is in fact a companion,

198
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,880
one that none of us will ever escape.

199
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,840
When Trump got elected,

200
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,720
they always viewed themselves as the heroes of that story.

201
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,760
But when death finally seriously reared its ugly head

202
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,360
within their lives for the first time,

203
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,720
they all became Voldemort,

204
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,800
or at the very least Voldemort's lackeys.

205
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,080
The honest truth is,

206
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,320
I don't even think the virus is that bad.

207
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,920
Yes, people are dying,

208
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,520
but more people die of the flu.

209
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,640
Hell, more people die of heat stroke during the summer.

210
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,600
And despite that,

211
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,720
not having air conditioning isn't exactly illegal or anything.

212
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,200
We consider these things like the heat or the flu

213
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,560
or even cancer or other major medical problems

214
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,640
as things that yes, they need to be fought,

215
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,840
but they are not worth destroying our society in order to fight them.

216
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,920
And the coronavirus should be the same way.

217
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,040
I think the mortality rate of the coronavirus is actually a lot lower.

218
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,480
I've been saying this for a while now.

219
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,320
I think the virus has mutated into an asymptomatic variant

220
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,480
that has been at least partially inoculating

221
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,680
large swaths of the population without anybody even recognizing it.

222
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,440
And the reason that I think this is yes,

223
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,560
that Icelandic study,

224
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,600
there are other studies coming out now of like Italy, South Korea, Spain,

225
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,440
even China, for all the good that'll do us.

226
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,480
But my point is,

227
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,160
when you compare jurisdictions that have completely locked everything down

228
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,960
and turned into complete totalitarian nightmare states

229
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
and other locations that have not really done anything,

230
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,320
the decline in the acceleration of cases is identical.

231
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,160
And that tells me that the number of people

232
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,040
who are still capable of being infected is dropping.

233
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,440
And that means inoculation.

234
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,800
It sounds kind of strange actually,

235
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,680
but Boris Johnson's idea of herd immunity was probably correct.

236
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,200
But to tie this all together,

237
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,120
I think the reason that preparedness is now frowned upon when it once wasn't

238
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,200
is because preparedness shows people who don't prepare that they're vulnerable,

239
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,040
that society may not always function exactly the way that it currently does.

240
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,440
And they don't like to be woken up to that fact.

241
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,960
And in the more extreme cases,

242
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,040
they don't like to be reminded of their own mortality.

243
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,800
Back in January when somebody was saying,

244
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,520
I'm going to buy six months worth of food, like me,

245
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,000
because there might be a problem in the future and I don't starve.

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,960
Yes, we were all called racists and conspiracy theorists.

247
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,720
But we were called those names by people who had such unwavering faith in the system,

248
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,240
not because the system itself is stable, even though it is stable,

249
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,080
but because they don't want to look into the abyss of their own personal apocalypse,

250
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,560
because they fear death so much

251
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,520
that even the idea that death will one day come for them is offensive.

252
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,640
So they would rather shame you into being ignorant the way that they are.

253
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,800
And then when it can no longer be ignored,

254
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,520
when the gravity of the situation finally reaches them,

255
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,720
they switch from insulting you for being prepared

256
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,360
to being willing to sign their soul away just for one extra breath.

257
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,640
To me, it's not worth it.

258
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,480
I'm not acting like those dumb spring break partiers who are saying,

259
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,360
Oh, well, if I get the coronavirus, I get it. Who cares? I'm going to party.

260
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,200
I'm not acting like those people who don't believe that it exists and are saying,

261
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,040
whatever, I'll just go out and live my life regularly.

262
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,000
Then they end up dying.

263
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,880
I'm not saying don't practice social distancing.

264
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,200
Don't wear masks if you feel like you need one,

265
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,920
because those are also forms of preparedness as well.

266
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,160
What I am saying is that the facade of eternal life that we've all been living,

267
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,400
because we're all relatively young and in relatively prosperous countries,

268
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,440
maintaining that facade at all costs is not worth giving up our liberty.

269
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,160
In all likelihood, this will happen again within our lifetimes.

270
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,200
Maybe not a disease, but some kind of emergency situation.

271
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,520
And if you feel the need to prepare for something, for anything, do it.

272
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,760
And don't let anyone shame you into not doing it,

273
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,840
because in their shaming, they are revealing themselves to be a coward.

274
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,560
And your attempt at confronting the future problem

275
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,400
as forthrightly as you can will always be offensive to a coward.
