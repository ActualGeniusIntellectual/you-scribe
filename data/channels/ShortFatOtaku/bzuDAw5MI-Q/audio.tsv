0	3280	Why is the idea of preparation nowadays frowned upon?
3280	6640	Before, the idea was that it was a good idea to save for a rainy day.
6640	9360	Like a squirrel packing away nuts for the winter or something.
9360	13200	You would work hard here and now so that you wouldn't have to work hard later
13200	18160	when working hard would either one, be impossible, or two, be significantly harder.
18160	21760	But nowadays, the idea of preparation just seems to be a joke, doesn't it?
21760	25520	When you think of a prepper, you think of some guy wearing a tinfoil hat and a gas mask,
25520	27840	sitting in the bunker that he built in his own backyard,
27840	32320	fiddling with a ham radio and eating an MRE beside a giant pile of guns and ammo.
32320	36320	And people like that are considered by the mainstream to be conspiracy theorist nutjobs.
36320	39920	Of course, some of them probably actually are conspiracy theorist nutjobs,
39920	45680	like those people that tried to do prep by buying 552 cans of Mountain Dew.
58640	59600	Oh, it's a Mountain Dew.
59600	86880	I
86880	89120	guess these are just the parents of Movie Bob?
89120	93280	But certainly not all people who prepare for a disaster are conspiracy theorists.
93280	98080	That's why you get comments like this from Mother Jones, who obviously lie through their teeth.
98080	102000	The only conservatives who took COVID-19 seriously were the conspiracy theorists.
102000	103600	This is demonstrably false.
103600	107200	Regardless of how you feel about Tucker Carlson, he's hit or miss for me.
107200	112160	Here's him back in January urging his viewers to pay attention to the coronavirus.
112160	116560	In America's newsroom, impeachment is all that matters and that should tell you something.
117040	119200	In fact, it ought to make you suspicious.
119200	124160	The world is changing incredibly fast out there and it's fascinating and ominous
124160	125120	and worth covering.
125680	127600	But by and large, the media are all but ignoring it.
127600	128720	Why are they doing that?
129360	134400	Well, consider the stories they're downplaying in favor of a protracted government hearing
134400	135760	whose ending we already know.
136400	140640	For starters, at this very moment, a serious viral outbreak is spreading across China,
140640	141680	the world's biggest country.
142240	147760	In just a matter of weeks, this new strain of coronavirus has generated almost as many
147760	149280	new cases as SARS did.
149280	150080	Remember SARS?
150720	152640	As SARS did in three full months.
152640	157920	I would not call Tucker Carlson a conspiracy theorist, just a regular conservative pundit.
157920	161760	But the image of the tinfoil hat wearing nutjob is an evocative one.
161760	165920	And I'm not surprised that there are elements of the radical left that have taken to using
165920	170000	that image to bludgeon all people they disagree with, as always.
170000	172080	For example, think back a few months.
172080	174000	Whether you're conservative or not doesn't really matter.
174560	178800	If you voiced to, say, your friends or maybe some people you know online who are relatively
178800	183600	apolitical your concerns about the coronavirus, did you get called a conspiracy theorist?
183600	185120	Even if you're not a conservative at all?
185680	187600	You probably did, at least by somebody.
187600	189040	Did you get called a racist?
189680	190960	Yeah, probably.
190960	194080	There's no way we all have that bad of a memory, right?
194080	201280	Like, I can understand some people not understanding, say, the 2008 election or the 2004 election
201280	205440	or the 2000 election or, like, that previous era of politics where it was dominated by
205440	206720	the Bushes and the Clintons.
206720	212240	I can actually forgive some really young people who truly believe that Trump is the worst
212240	216800	thing to ever happen to the world because they're too young to remember or understand
216800	221120	the devastating impact of the second Iraq war and Bush's cowboy diplomacy.
221120	223760	Or even Obama's neoliberal backstabbery.
223840	224720	I get it, man.
224720	228720	I was a kid in the early 90s, but I don't remember the politics of that era personally.
228720	230720	But really, three months.
231520	234800	You guys can't remember the stuff you were saying three months ago.
234800	237360	This is from January 28th of this year.
237360	240800	Ontario School Board warns that coronavirus concerns
240800	242960	veer into anti-Chinese racism.
242960	245040	No one's publishing garbage like this now.
245040	248640	Before coronavirus hit our shores, it was all, don't be racist.
248640	249600	Don't be a bigot.
249600	252800	You're a Trump-loving cinephobe if you stock up for a potential pandemic.
252800	256560	Or if you don't go down to your local Chinese restaurant and eat the bat soup or something.
256560	260240	Reading this stuff almost makes me feel like I'm looking back at a different era.
260240	266240	The mayor of Florence, Italy initiated Hug a Chinese on Twitter on February 1st.
266240	269920	Opposing anger towards China amid the coronavirus outbreak
269920	272000	and calling for unity in this common battle.
273200	273700	Yeah?
274480	275760	How did that work out for Italy?
276480	279760	I'm not saying that hugging a Chinese person is wrong, obviously,
279760	282000	or that it caused the outbreak or that it exacerbated it.
282000	286880	I'm saying that people who spent their time virtue signaling rather than preparing
286880	289600	found themselves up shit creek without a paddle.
290160	290880	So what happened?
291520	294800	When did it stop being virtuous to plan ahead for your future?
294800	296720	I think I've seen this brewing for a while, to be honest.
297440	301280	When I was younger, I was as reliable as I could be.
301280	303200	I'm still as reliable as I can be now.
303200	304320	You can always get better at that.
304320	308640	But like, basically what I mean is, when I said I would do something, I would do it.
308640	310400	When I said I would be somewhere, I would be there.
311120	313520	And I held other people to that same standard.
313520	316560	And I was told in my early 20s that I was being unreasonable.
317200	320880	You know, that if someone says, yeah, I'll be there at four and then they're there at six
320880	324720	or they just don't show up at all and they just apologize about it three days later.
324720	329200	That pissed me off because my time is valuable and I don't want to waste it dicking around.
329200	332640	But apparently I was being unreasonable, holding others to a standard.
332640	336560	I wasn't being understanding or I was being too rigid or I was not
336560	339440	understanding the power of spontaneity or something.
339440	342160	Like, there was a lot of excuses people gave for this, but at the end of the day,
342160	344320	it was just flaky people being flaky.
344320	350480	And I think that that has gone from, like, an obvious character detriment to something
350480	355040	that people hold on to as part of their personality because they think that their
355040	359520	quirks make them who they are, which really, that isn't how personality works.
359520	363520	Most people who say they have a quirky personality, what that means is they have a
363520	366400	bunch of flaws that they haven't actually done the hard work of getting rid of.
366400	369840	And they're making excuses about it by saying that, oh, they're just lol so random.
369840	373920	And even though I'm talking about a personal and interpersonal thing here,
373920	376640	I think it does actually push into the realm of politics
376640	379360	as far as social justice ideology is concerned.
379360	383520	Because again, if we're going to go back to the whole valueless postmodernism thing,
383520	386960	why is being on time any better than not being on time?
386960	390400	If there can be no value judgments, then both of those options are the same.
390400	394000	And that does bleed over into things like being prepared.
394000	397920	According to this lens, there is no value difference between preparing for the future
397920	401520	and not preparing for the future. Therefore, there's only moral judgment.
401520	404640	Does your preparation out you as a tinfoil hat wearing nutcase?
405280	409120	Or, alternatively, a racist? That's the only question that they're concerned with.
409120	413120	And so, when the seriousness of a situation finally collapses in on these people and
413120	417840	they've done no preparation at all, they, too, find themselves up shit creek.
417840	421920	Gone are the days of the victory garden, where the main reason people grew food in
421920	425280	their own backyard was because they actually had to feed their family
425280	427600	during a war where food was in short supply.
427600	430560	And this was promoted both through the government and culturally,
430560	434720	because it also drove food prices down, meaning that food was actually cheaper
434720	437760	for the US government to buy and therefore feed their troops with.
437760	441760	Not only backyards, but public spaces became gardens
441760	444480	because it was a crisis situation and everyone had to pitch in.
444480	446320	Compare this with the coronavirus situation.
446320	449840	If you told people three months ago that you were considering planting a garden in the spring
449840	452400	because of coronavirus and because you didn't know how much food there would be,
452400	453920	if there would be shortages or whatever,
453920	456480	they would look at you like you had your head on backwards.
456480	460000	But now, after planting season is already well underway in the United States,
460000	462480	all of these people who are perpetually late to the game
462480	464720	are now scrambling to try and plant gardens.
464720	467840	This is all topped off by the fact that some governments and jurisdictions
468400	472960	are banning the sale of seeds and gardening supplies because they're not necessary.
472960	474720	How ridiculous is this?
474720	476320	You're allowed to go out to the grocery store,
476320	479360	where there's a whole bunch of other people who might be transmitting the virus,
479440	482000	get groceries, which might be infected with the virus,
482000	484720	and do this repeatedly as you need more food,
484720	487120	being entirely dependent on the supply chain.
487120	492000	But when it comes to buying seeds and growing your own for the remainder of the sunny season,
492000	492800	nope, can't do it.
492800	497360	You think a one-time purchase of seeds and then going out to the grocery store a lot less
497360	500880	would be a lot more social distancing than constant grocery trips.
500880	504640	But as it turns out, gardening itself is a form of preparation.
504640	507120	You're not just going to the store and getting what you need.
507600	511440	You're planting, investing, waiting a month, two months, three months,
511440	513840	however long it takes to start getting your vegetables.
513840	517600	And if the goal is to break the self-sufficiency of people who prepare
517600	520800	and force them to be entirely dependent on the supply chain,
520800	523200	the structure of the state and the corporation,
523200	526560	this is exactly the kind of thing that you would do during a crisis.
526560	531840	It almost seems like in our mad scramble for safety, we've killed ourselves.
531840	533280	We killed ourselves from fear.
534000	537440	We became so self-centered that we thought we would never die.
537440	540080	And with this immortality just within our grasp,
543360	547120	any possible threat of death, however remote or unlikely,
547120	549440	became the thing that paralyzed us.
549440	551680	And I'm not saying that fear of death is a bad thing.
551680	553120	I'm not even saying that it's unreasonable.
553120	553920	I get it.
553920	557840	For an atheist like me, where there's nothing after death,
558880	560880	death is the scariest thing.
560880	564480	It means that on some level the world is just a trapping,
564480	566400	and for each and every single one of us,
566400	569520	behind all of this lies our own personal apocalypse.
569520	572720	But does fear of death justify cowardice to such an extent
572720	574800	that life is no longer worth living?
574800	579040	Are people truly so weak that when a crisis finally comes for them,
579040	581920	they run crying towards any authority they can?
581920	584000	The state, corporations, doesn't matter.
584000	586480	Screaming, please, I'll give you anything.
586480	587600	Just save me.
587600	589600	I don't care what quality of life I have.
589600	591280	I don't care how terrible it is.
591280	592800	Just keep me from death.
592800	594400	We always like to make fun of the radical left
594400	596160	and how they keep bringing up Harry Potter,
596160	598480	you know, years and years after the series has ended.
598480	600240	We always say read another book.
600240	602320	But considering that they love it so much,
602320	604320	you think they would have understood the core lessons
604320	605840	those books had to teach us.
605840	608560	Voldemort is a tyrant because he fears dying.
608560	611600	He even says nothing is worse than death.
611600	614160	His inner circle is named the Death Eaters,
614160	616400	basically a group of people who are so hopped up
616400	618160	on their own arrogance and importance
618160	620160	that they believe that they are above death,
620160	621840	specifically that they're so far above it
621840	622880	that it's like food to them,
622880	625040	the same way that animals are food to humans.
625040	627520	Meanwhile, Harry Potter, the hero of the story,
627520	629280	recognizes death as being evil,
629280	631200	but not as the paramount evil.
631200	634560	That there are worse things that you can do while alive than die.
634560	638640	And that when it comes time for somebody to simply die naturally,
638640	640480	that death is not evil at all,
640480	642000	but is in fact a companion,
642640	644880	one that none of us will ever escape.
644880	645840	When Trump got elected,
645840	648720	they always viewed themselves as the heroes of that story.
648720	651760	But when death finally seriously reared its ugly head
651760	653360	within their lives for the first time,
653360	654720	they all became Voldemort,
654720	656800	or at the very least Voldemort's lackeys.
656800	658080	The honest truth is,
658080	660320	I don't even think the virus is that bad.
660320	661920	Yes, people are dying,
661920	663520	but more people die of the flu.
663520	666640	Hell, more people die of heat stroke during the summer.
666640	667600	And despite that,
667600	670720	not having air conditioning isn't exactly illegal or anything.
670720	673200	We consider these things like the heat or the flu
673200	676560	or even cancer or other major medical problems
676560	678640	as things that yes, they need to be fought,
678640	681840	but they are not worth destroying our society in order to fight them.
681840	683920	And the coronavirus should be the same way.
683920	687040	I think the mortality rate of the coronavirus is actually a lot lower.
687040	688480	I've been saying this for a while now.
688480	692320	I think the virus has mutated into an asymptomatic variant
692320	694480	that has been at least partially inoculating
694480	697680	large swaths of the population without anybody even recognizing it.
697680	699440	And the reason that I think this is yes,
699440	700560	that Icelandic study,
700560	703600	there are other studies coming out now of like Italy, South Korea, Spain,
703600	705440	even China, for all the good that'll do us.
705440	706480	But my point is,
706480	710160	when you compare jurisdictions that have completely locked everything down
710160	712960	and turned into complete totalitarian nightmare states
712960	714960	and other locations that have not really done anything,
714960	718320	the decline in the acceleration of cases is identical.
718320	720160	And that tells me that the number of people
720160	723040	who are still capable of being infected is dropping.
723680	725440	And that means inoculation.
725440	726800	It sounds kind of strange actually,
726800	729680	but Boris Johnson's idea of herd immunity was probably correct.
729680	731200	But to tie this all together,
731200	735120	I think the reason that preparedness is now frowned upon when it once wasn't
735120	739200	is because preparedness shows people who don't prepare that they're vulnerable,
739200	743040	that society may not always function exactly the way that it currently does.
743040	745440	And they don't like to be woken up to that fact.
745440	746960	And in the more extreme cases,
746960	749040	they don't like to be reminded of their own mortality.
749040	750800	Back in January when somebody was saying,
750800	753520	I'm going to buy six months worth of food, like me,
753520	756000	because there might be a problem in the future and I don't starve.
756000	758960	Yes, we were all called racists and conspiracy theorists.
758960	764720	But we were called those names by people who had such unwavering faith in the system,
764720	768240	not because the system itself is stable, even though it is stable,
768240	772080	but because they don't want to look into the abyss of their own personal apocalypse,
772080	774560	because they fear death so much
775200	779520	that even the idea that death will one day come for them is offensive.
779520	782640	So they would rather shame you into being ignorant the way that they are.
782640	784800	And then when it can no longer be ignored,
784800	787520	when the gravity of the situation finally reaches them,
787520	790720	they switch from insulting you for being prepared
790720	795360	to being willing to sign their soul away just for one extra breath.
795360	796640	To me, it's not worth it.
796640	800480	I'm not acting like those dumb spring break partiers who are saying,
800480	803360	Oh, well, if I get the coronavirus, I get it. Who cares? I'm going to party.
803360	807200	I'm not acting like those people who don't believe that it exists and are saying,
807200	809040	whatever, I'll just go out and live my life regularly.
809040	810000	Then they end up dying.
810000	812880	I'm not saying don't practice social distancing.
812880	815200	Don't wear masks if you feel like you need one,
815200	817920	because those are also forms of preparedness as well.
817920	822160	What I am saying is that the facade of eternal life that we've all been living,
822160	826400	because we're all relatively young and in relatively prosperous countries,
826400	831440	maintaining that facade at all costs is not worth giving up our liberty.
831440	834160	In all likelihood, this will happen again within our lifetimes.
834160	837200	Maybe not a disease, but some kind of emergency situation.
837200	841520	And if you feel the need to prepare for something, for anything, do it.
841520	843760	And don't let anyone shame you into not doing it,
843760	847840	because in their shaming, they are revealing themselves to be a coward.
847840	850560	And your attempt at confronting the future problem
850560	854400	as forthrightly as you can will always be offensive to a coward.
