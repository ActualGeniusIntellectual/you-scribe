0	9560	Hello, you greasy goblins, welcome to TikTok Tuesday.
9560	13040	I know I try to have TikTok Tuesday out at noon, this is definitely not coming out at
13040	15800	noon because, well, that's when I'm recording it.
15800	19080	So this will be coming out a little bit later in the day, maybe even in time for tonight's
19080	20080	stream.
20080	21080	That's alright though.
21080	22080	Let's get to it.
22080	24400	What kind of nonsense have you guys sent me this week?
24400	28240	Oh, we're starting off with a fight today!
28240	29240	Damn.
29240	36880	Oh my god.
36880	38760	Where's this guy recording this from?
38760	43240	He's like on a walkway above the store?
43240	52000	Damn, what the fuck, lady?
52000	53000	You deserve it?
53000	54480	You deserve to get thrown the fuck out.
54480	56880	What the fuck was- was she just going wild over booze?
56880	58440	Hold on, let me see here.
58440	60280	Yeah, maybe she's a shotlifter or something.
60280	62680	I mean, it doesn't look like she's too young to drink.
62680	65540	That's something that you see a lot of when there's like young people who are trying to
65540	69520	buy booze and they get caught because they've got like an underage ID or they're clearly
69520	70800	too young or something.
70800	74280	They start throwing a tantrum and destroying the liquor store or the liquor section of
74280	75280	the store.
75280	76280	This woman ain't that.
76280	77840	Yeah, maybe she's a shotlifter or something.
77840	82720	Let's talk about trans people using public bathrooms from a trans woman's perspective.
82720	85000	Hi, bestie.
85000	91320	I think as a fellow trans woman, you would agree that the world is not made for us.
91320	96320	And I think you've made your opinion very clear that trans individuals can make other
96320	98060	people uncomfortable.
98060	102000	I would agree with that, but here's where you and I differ.
102000	103000	I don't care.
103000	107560	I don't exist to make the cis world comfortable.
107560	110440	I'm here to change this world.
110440	117640	I'm here to live my life the way I want to, to make the next generation of trans people
117640	120280	make their life a little bit easier.
120280	125360	So while you want to limit yourself and you want to appease the world, I'll be out there
125360	127540	living my life and changing it.
127540	128540	So you have a great day.
128540	129540	Love you.
129540	130540	Bye.
130540	131540	Here's the thing.
131540	132540	I don't know how TikTok works.
132540	135120	It seems like this is like a reply from another person who's also on TikTok.
135120	137400	I think they call it a stitch over there.
137400	139000	Man, I don't understand it.
139000	141160	I'm too boomer for any of this shit.
141160	142160	I don't get it.
142160	145080	But it seems like it started off with one trans woman who was going to give her take
145080	148240	about trans women in women's bathrooms and then a second trans woman.
148240	153760	I guess that toque makes it kind of hard to tell, but a second trans woman who shows up
153760	154760	and is replying.
154760	160280	And I think stitching just means that the TikTok you're replying to, TikTok automatically
160280	164760	adds like the first five seconds of the video onto your video or something.
164760	166000	I don't fucking know.
166000	168720	But more importantly, check out this person's rhetoric.
168720	171600	As individuals can make other people uncomfortable.
171600	173480	I agree with that.
173480	175620	But here's where you and I differ.
175620	176720	I don't care.
176720	180180	I don't exist to make the cis world comfortable.
180180	181180	And there you have it.
181180	186280	This is somebody who knows that if they walk into a woman's bathroom and all of the cis
186280	189280	women in the bathroom are really upset by it.
189280	190280	This person doesn't care.
190280	191280	They just don't care.
191280	192280	They don't give a shit.
192280	197600	They would rather the vast majority of people bend to the whims of the minority for that
197600	198600	minority's comfort.
198600	203740	And this is something that I went into with Sargon and Adam and Sitch over on the Adam
203740	208940	and Sitch show on their channel, where basically I said in the real world, people don't actually
208940	211900	care about the trans bathroom issue.
211900	213320	As long as you pass.
213320	217540	When you get a trans woman who passes really well, the example that's always used is Blair
217540	222420	White, but any of them really that pass really well and they walk into a girl's room, no
222420	225380	one cares because they're not making it a political statement.
225380	226380	They're not doing this.
227380	228380	They're not here to change the world.
228380	229380	Bullshit.
229380	230880	They're just living a relatively normal life.
230880	234380	And outside of the internet, outside of all the bullshit ideology, that's how the trans
234380	235680	stuff actually works.
235680	238280	A trans woman counts as a woman if they pass.
238280	240200	And if they don't, then they count as a man.
240200	241200	That's how it is.
241200	243840	So let me know if this makes sense to you guys, but I just got done getting groceries
243840	244840	at the store.
244840	249240	And like, as I was walking out, this lady walks past me and she goes, Oh, Kanye shoes.
249240	250240	Really?
250240	251240	And like, I just stopped.
251240	252240	I looked at her.
252240	253240	I was like, what?
253240	257500	And she says, if you wear shoes made by Kanye, you're equally as much of a piece of shit
257500	258500	as he is.
258500	260740	And I was like, what?
260740	263020	Because first of all, I'm not even wearing Yeezys.
263020	264660	I'm wearing New Balances.
264660	270540	And second of all, there is no groceries.
270540	271540	What the fuck?
271540	272540	What?
272540	281140	What am I watching?
281140	286040	What is this fucking fever dream?
286040	290040	There's a fat guy in the background.
290040	292040	Okay.
292040	300080	Oh, oh my.
300080	309480	Uh, wow.
309480	315340	That was, uh, that was the ultimate that happened story, I guess.
315340	320340	You know how sometimes you can like turn on a TikTok and someone's telling a story and
320340	324660	they're clearly either like hyper embellishing it or it just didn't happen.
324660	327260	And they're just making something up to try and go viral on their page.
327260	331220	I guess we've reached a peak meta irony with this shit, haven't we?
331220	333420	And now that I'm looking at it again, look at the background, dude.
333420	334420	Yeah.
334420	335420	He's clearly in front of like a boarded up store.
335420	337060	I just didn't notice the first time through.
337060	342720	I wonder how many closed K-marts there are across the United States or like targets or
342720	343720	whatever.
343720	344720	There's probably a lot of them.
344720	348560	A lot of these stores that are just closed up and become, you know, graffiti havens.
348560	350420	Oh shit.
350420	358880	It's the pride street in Brit bong land.
358880	359880	What's going on here?
359880	360880	The change in the flags.
360880	362960	You're taking the wrong fucking flag down mate.
362960	368380	At least you know that.
368380	371580	Oh man.
371580	375900	Even the, uh, even like the civil service guys, the, uh, you know, the public works
375900	380380	guys, they know that what they're doing, uh, doesn't exactly feel right, but Hey, it's
380380	381380	part of the job.
381380	382380	You got to do it.
382380	386600	I guess it's interesting that everyone who's in the like the lower echelons of society,
386600	390900	they all have an intuitive feeling that this doesn't, this doesn't sit well with them,
390900	391900	you know?
391900	395400	But they're doing it cause they're paid to do it.
395400	396400	I'm in shock.
396400	397400	Look, what?
397400	398400	Oh my good loving.
398400	399400	Yup.
399400	400400	Another robbery one.
400400	403400	I'm in shock.
403400	406240	They young as hell.
406240	409040	They got trash bags in their pockets.
409040	411640	They really taking the whole store security.
411640	418040	Dude, the worker's not paid enough to stop this.
418040	422500	You paid minimum in Nike store and Watts where the kids come in and rob and they don't
422500	426560	do absolutely nothing.
426560	429820	They are filling up a whole bag.
429820	431820	Do you hear me?
431820	432820	Yep.
432820	435300	She asked me if I want to save my card on file.
435300	437300	Thank you.
437300	441340	No, man.
441340	442340	It's disgraceful.
442340	445700	It is despicable behavior, but I mean, no one's stopping them, right?
445700	446700	That's just how it's going to be.
446700	449400	I mean, the employees don't get paid enough to stop them.
449400	453240	If the store security is not stopping them, if the cops aren't showing up, I mean, what
453240	454240	do you expect?
454240	458640	There has to be some kind of punishment for being a thief, but right now there just isn't.
458640	459640	Oh yeah.
459640	465020	This one, this is from turning point UK, but it was a, it was a recording of a teacher
465020	469460	flipping out at kids, questioning gender identity or gender theory.
469460	474080	So the idea is you have like a woke millennial teacher who really wants to teach the, the
474080	475080	trans stuff.
475080	479000	And I think these are like, like upper aged elementary school students.
479000	483160	We're talking like grade seven, grade eight, you know, you know, just before high school.
483160	484580	That's what it seems like anyway.
484580	488900	And the kids, they're not fucking having it like, damn, maybe, maybe the youth would be
488900	495240	all right after all.
495240	496240	Who was upset?
496240	497240	The teacher
497240	506920	That's a bit much, oh, we didn't say that.
506920	511920	That clicking in the audio.
511920	512920	It's good to question their identity
512920	537240	Gender is not linked to do with not linked gender is about how you identify, which is
537240	544200	what I said, right from the very who cares how you identify biological biological sex.
544200	547200	There is actually three logical sex.
547200	548800	You can be born into sex.
548800	553560	You can be born with male and female body parts or hormones.
553560	554560	Yeah.
554560	563160	But most trans people are intersex, in terms of gender, there are lots of genders, lots
563160	564160	of made up shit.
564160	571520	There is a gender people who don't believe they have a gender at all.
571520	572520	Yeah.
572520	575520	We just don't agree with that.
575520	578520	We have a giant year ago.
578520	579520	Yeah.
579520	583520	But cisgender is not necessarily the way to be.
583520	585520	Oh, my God.
585520	593360	But you identify with the gender that of the sexual order that you're born with, or you're
594360	597400	I mean, yeah, it is kind of weird, but it's fine to be weird, dude.
597400	598400	It's okay.
598400	599400	I'm right now.
599400	600400	I'm here.
600400	601400	My mom.
601400	602400	That's very sad as well, though.
602400	603400	How is it?
603400	604400	Loads of people agree with that.
604400	607520	There's only a small majority of people who actually think a small majority.
607520	608520	Come on.
608520	609520	Hold on.
609520	610520	Come on, kid.
610520	611520	With homophobia.
611520	616520	I'm fine with lesbians and gay people.
616520	623120	I've got nothing against that gender is is what this is painful, guys.
623880	624880	Oh, Jesus.
624880	625880	No, they can't.
625880	626880	They can't.
626880	627880	Unless you get a penis attached.
627880	628880	No, I'm not.
628880	629880	You're confusing sex and gender.
629880	630880	No, I'm not, though.
630880	631880	Because if you have a vagina, you're a girl.
631880	632880	If you have a penis, you're a woman.
632880	633880	Yeah.
633880	634880	You can't have a vagina.
634880	635880	Oh, God.
635880	636880	Even then, because you've got those genes.
636880	637880	I mean, it's actually great this is being recorded.
637880	638880	It's not an opinion.
638880	639880	Yes, it is.
639880	640880	Yes, it is.
640880	641880	No, it's not.
641880	642880	And if you don't like it, you need to go to a different school.
642880	643880	Oh, get out of the school if you don't like it.
643880	652880	You need to have a proper educational conversation about equality, diversity, and inclusion.
652880	654880	Keep gigachatting, kids.
654880	656880	You can be who you want to be.
656880	657880	Everyone else can be.
657880	658880	How you identify is up to you.
658880	659880	Everyone else thinks it.
659880	660880	They just don't play it.
660880	661880	Because they're always at it.
661880	662880	Maybe because they're polite, and maybe they're sensitive.
662880	663880	I don't know.
663880	664880	I don't know.
664880	665880	I don't know.
665880	666880	I don't know.
666880	667880	I don't know.
667880	668880	I don't know.
668880	669880	I don't know.
669880	670880	I don't know.
670880	671880	I don't know.
672880	673880	I don't know.
673880	674880	I don't know.
674880	675880	I don't know.
675880	676880	I don't know.
676880	677880	Maybe because they're polite and maybe they're sensitive.
677880	678880	I haven't said anything of all the lessons I've been in.
678880	679880	It's just because they turned around and started saying something.
679880	680880	So I said, how can you identify as a cat when you're a girl?
680880	681880	Yeah.
681880	683880	When they're not writing a statement, I would imagine that you'll be asked to write a statement
683880	684880	as well.
684880	685880	We will.
685880	686880	We will.
686880	687880	We will.
688880	689880	Based.
689880	692680	That teacher's just completely captured.
692680	699200	Man, I don't often say this because I think conservatives tend to overplay their hand
699200	701960	on this point, but in this case, I will say it.
702000	703580	You got to get your kids out of that classroom.
703580	706660	And if you're if you're a kid in that classroom, you got it.
706660	710580	You got to understand that you on some level, you are definitely being lied to
710580	713160	or maybe not not lied to because they think it's real.
713160	716680	But, you know, ideologically indoctrinated. That was wild.
717880	721760	Man, another robbery, one lots of robbery, one said this week, guys, they're good.
723480	725640	Look at them stealing.
726500	728000	Really, bro?
728000	731800	You got to resort to this economy is not that bad.
734180	736100	Wait, it's all like cleaning supplies.
736100	738020	They use it for drugs, maybe.
740480	741980	Holy shit.
742360	744360	Maybe the house is really dirty.
744360	747900	Better get it while the getting's good.
749400	750440	Oh, shit. Oh, man.
750440	751740	They covered the.
752600	755980	Oh, wait, they leave the guy behind.
759560	761600	Oh, my God. They got the plate.
761600	763640	They got somebody run that plate.
763980	765680	You got to stop these fucks.
765680	769520	I know, like in previous TikTok Tuesdays, people kept saying,
769700	772560	what are the race of the people involved to have one of the race?
772860	776020	And yeah, there's definitely a disproportionate amount of black people
776020	780900	doing this, generally because of the culture and the neighborhoods.
781280	783740	Maybe the maybe the economic conditions.
783900	786320	It's obviously not genetics, like that's fucking stupid.
786580	790420	But yeah, it seems like since stealing is
790820	794740	apparently not being punished right now, everyone who's a thief is getting in on it.
795280	797420	All right, guys, that's the end of it for me.
797960	800420	I know I skipped last week or something, but I'm glad to be back.
800580	803500	If you want to send me more TikTok Tuesdays content,
803840	806260	hit me up on Discord, hit me up on Twitter.
806540	809180	I do have the original SFO Twitter account back,
809180	812260	but it's actually been shadowbanned, so you have to like come to my profile.
812420	816300	But the Morbius Devo account has been has been destroyed.
816600	818760	I flew too close to the sun on that one.
818760	821140	All right. I'll be streaming something or other tonight.
821140	822640	I don't know what it is yet. I guess we'll see.
822640	824640	And yes, more videos are coming as well.
