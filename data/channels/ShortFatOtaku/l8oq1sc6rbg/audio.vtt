00:00.000 --> 00:09.560
Hello, you greasy goblins, welcome to TikTok Tuesday.

00:09.560 --> 00:13.040
I know I try to have TikTok Tuesday out at noon, this is definitely not coming out at

00:13.040 --> 00:15.800
noon because, well, that's when I'm recording it.

00:15.800 --> 00:19.080
So this will be coming out a little bit later in the day, maybe even in time for tonight's

00:19.080 --> 00:20.080
stream.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.080
That's alright though.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
Let's get to it.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.400
What kind of nonsense have you guys sent me this week?

00:24.400 --> 00:28.240
Oh, we're starting off with a fight today!

00:28.240 --> 00:29.240
Damn.

00:29.240 --> 00:36.880
Oh my god.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.760
Where's this guy recording this from?

00:38.760 --> 00:43.240
He's like on a walkway above the store?

00:43.240 --> 00:52.000
Damn, what the fuck, lady?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
You deserve it?

00:53.000 --> 00:54.480
You deserve to get thrown the fuck out.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.880
What the fuck was- was she just going wild over booze?

00:56.880 --> 00:58.440
Hold on, let me see here.

00:58.440 --> 01:00.280
Yeah, maybe she's a shotlifter or something.

01:00.280 --> 01:02.680
I mean, it doesn't look like she's too young to drink.

01:02.680 --> 01:05.540
That's something that you see a lot of when there's like young people who are trying to

01:05.540 --> 01:09.520
buy booze and they get caught because they've got like an underage ID or they're clearly

01:09.520 --> 01:10.800
too young or something.

01:10.800 --> 01:14.280
They start throwing a tantrum and destroying the liquor store or the liquor section of

01:14.280 --> 01:15.280
the store.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.280
This woman ain't that.

01:16.280 --> 01:17.840
Yeah, maybe she's a shotlifter or something.

01:17.840 --> 01:22.720
Let's talk about trans people using public bathrooms from a trans woman's perspective.

01:22.720 --> 01:25.000
Hi, bestie.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.320
I think as a fellow trans woman, you would agree that the world is not made for us.

01:31.320 --> 01:36.320
And I think you've made your opinion very clear that trans individuals can make other

01:36.320 --> 01:38.060
people uncomfortable.

01:38.060 --> 01:42.000
I would agree with that, but here's where you and I differ.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
I don't care.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.560
I don't exist to make the cis world comfortable.

01:47.560 --> 01:50.440
I'm here to change this world.

01:50.440 --> 01:57.640
I'm here to live my life the way I want to, to make the next generation of trans people

01:57.640 --> 02:00.280
make their life a little bit easier.

02:00.280 --> 02:05.360
So while you want to limit yourself and you want to appease the world, I'll be out there

02:05.360 --> 02:07.540
living my life and changing it.

02:07.540 --> 02:08.540
So you have a great day.

02:08.540 --> 02:09.540
Love you.

02:09.540 --> 02:10.540
Bye.

02:10.540 --> 02:11.540
Here's the thing.

02:11.540 --> 02:12.540
I don't know how TikTok works.

02:12.540 --> 02:15.120
It seems like this is like a reply from another person who's also on TikTok.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.400
I think they call it a stitch over there.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.000
Man, I don't understand it.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.160
I'm too boomer for any of this shit.

02:21.160 --> 02:22.160
I don't get it.

02:22.160 --> 02:25.080
But it seems like it started off with one trans woman who was going to give her take

02:25.080 --> 02:28.240
about trans women in women's bathrooms and then a second trans woman.

02:28.240 --> 02:33.760
I guess that toque makes it kind of hard to tell, but a second trans woman who shows up

02:33.760 --> 02:34.760
and is replying.

02:34.760 --> 02:40.280
And I think stitching just means that the TikTok you're replying to, TikTok automatically

02:40.280 --> 02:44.760
adds like the first five seconds of the video onto your video or something.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.000
I don't fucking know.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.720
But more importantly, check out this person's rhetoric.

02:48.720 --> 02:51.600
As individuals can make other people uncomfortable.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.480
I agree with that.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.620
But here's where you and I differ.

02:55.620 --> 02:56.720
I don't care.

02:56.720 --> 03:00.180
I don't exist to make the cis world comfortable.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.180
And there you have it.

03:01.180 --> 03:06.280
This is somebody who knows that if they walk into a woman's bathroom and all of the cis

03:06.280 --> 03:09.280
women in the bathroom are really upset by it.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.280
This person doesn't care.

03:10.280 --> 03:11.280
They just don't care.

03:11.280 --> 03:12.280
They don't give a shit.

03:12.280 --> 03:17.600
They would rather the vast majority of people bend to the whims of the minority for that

03:17.600 --> 03:18.600
minority's comfort.

03:18.600 --> 03:23.740
And this is something that I went into with Sargon and Adam and Sitch over on the Adam

03:23.740 --> 03:28.940
and Sitch show on their channel, where basically I said in the real world, people don't actually

03:28.940 --> 03:31.900
care about the trans bathroom issue.

03:31.900 --> 03:33.320
As long as you pass.

03:33.320 --> 03:37.540
When you get a trans woman who passes really well, the example that's always used is Blair

03:37.540 --> 03:42.420
White, but any of them really that pass really well and they walk into a girl's room, no

03:42.420 --> 03:45.380
one cares because they're not making it a political statement.

03:45.380 --> 03:46.380
They're not doing this.

03:47.380 --> 03:48.380
They're not here to change the world.

03:48.380 --> 03:49.380
Bullshit.

03:49.380 --> 03:50.880
They're just living a relatively normal life.

03:50.880 --> 03:54.380
And outside of the internet, outside of all the bullshit ideology, that's how the trans

03:54.380 --> 03:55.680
stuff actually works.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.280
A trans woman counts as a woman if they pass.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.200
And if they don't, then they count as a man.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.200
That's how it is.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.840
So let me know if this makes sense to you guys, but I just got done getting groceries

04:03.840 --> 04:04.840
at the store.

04:04.840 --> 04:09.240
And like, as I was walking out, this lady walks past me and she goes, Oh, Kanye shoes.

04:09.240 --> 04:10.240
Really?

04:10.240 --> 04:11.240
And like, I just stopped.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.240
I looked at her.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.240
I was like, what?

04:13.240 --> 04:17.500
And she says, if you wear shoes made by Kanye, you're equally as much of a piece of shit

04:17.500 --> 04:18.500
as he is.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.740
And I was like, what?

04:20.740 --> 04:23.020
Because first of all, I'm not even wearing Yeezys.

04:23.020 --> 04:24.660
I'm wearing New Balances.

04:24.660 --> 04:30.540
And second of all, there is no groceries.

04:30.540 --> 04:31.540
What the fuck?

04:31.540 --> 04:32.540
What?

04:32.540 --> 04:41.140
What am I watching?

04:41.140 --> 04:46.040
What is this fucking fever dream?

04:46.040 --> 04:50.040
There's a fat guy in the background.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.040
Okay.

04:52.040 --> 05:00.080
Oh, oh my.

05:00.080 --> 05:09.480
Uh, wow.

05:09.480 --> 05:15.340
That was, uh, that was the ultimate that happened story, I guess.

05:15.340 --> 05:20.340
You know how sometimes you can like turn on a TikTok and someone's telling a story and

05:20.340 --> 05:24.660
they're clearly either like hyper embellishing it or it just didn't happen.

05:24.660 --> 05:27.260
And they're just making something up to try and go viral on their page.

05:27.260 --> 05:31.220
I guess we've reached a peak meta irony with this shit, haven't we?

05:31.220 --> 05:33.420
And now that I'm looking at it again, look at the background, dude.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.420
Yeah.

05:34.420 --> 05:35.420
He's clearly in front of like a boarded up store.

05:35.420 --> 05:37.060
I just didn't notice the first time through.

05:37.060 --> 05:42.720
I wonder how many closed K-marts there are across the United States or like targets or

05:42.720 --> 05:43.720
whatever.

05:43.720 --> 05:44.720
There's probably a lot of them.

05:44.720 --> 05:48.560
A lot of these stores that are just closed up and become, you know, graffiti havens.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.420
Oh shit.

05:50.420 --> 05:58.880
It's the pride street in Brit bong land.

05:58.880 --> 05:59.880
What's going on here?

05:59.880 --> 06:00.880
The change in the flags.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.960
You're taking the wrong fucking flag down mate.

06:02.960 --> 06:08.380
At least you know that.

06:08.380 --> 06:11.580
Oh man.

06:11.580 --> 06:15.900
Even the, uh, even like the civil service guys, the, uh, you know, the public works

06:15.900 --> 06:20.380
guys, they know that what they're doing, uh, doesn't exactly feel right, but Hey, it's

06:20.380 --> 06:21.380
part of the job.

06:21.380 --> 06:22.380
You got to do it.

06:22.380 --> 06:26.600
I guess it's interesting that everyone who's in the like the lower echelons of society,

06:26.600 --> 06:30.900
they all have an intuitive feeling that this doesn't, this doesn't sit well with them,

06:30.900 --> 06:31.900
you know?

06:31.900 --> 06:35.400
But they're doing it cause they're paid to do it.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.400
I'm in shock.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.400
Look, what?

06:37.400 --> 06:38.400
Oh my good loving.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.400
Yup.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.400
Another robbery one.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.400
I'm in shock.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.240
They young as hell.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.040
They got trash bags in their pockets.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.640
They really taking the whole store security.

06:51.640 --> 06:58.040
Dude, the worker's not paid enough to stop this.

06:58.040 --> 07:02.500
You paid minimum in Nike store and Watts where the kids come in and rob and they don't

07:02.500 --> 07:06.560
do absolutely nothing.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.820
They are filling up a whole bag.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.820
Do you hear me?

07:11.820 --> 07:12.820
Yep.

07:12.820 --> 07:15.300
She asked me if I want to save my card on file.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.300
Thank you.

07:17.300 --> 07:21.340
No, man.

07:21.340 --> 07:22.340
It's disgraceful.

07:22.340 --> 07:25.700
It is despicable behavior, but I mean, no one's stopping them, right?

07:25.700 --> 07:26.700
That's just how it's going to be.

07:26.700 --> 07:29.400
I mean, the employees don't get paid enough to stop them.

07:29.400 --> 07:33.240
If the store security is not stopping them, if the cops aren't showing up, I mean, what

07:33.240 --> 07:34.240
do you expect?

07:34.240 --> 07:38.640
There has to be some kind of punishment for being a thief, but right now there just isn't.

07:38.640 --> 07:39.640
Oh yeah.

07:39.640 --> 07:45.020
This one, this is from turning point UK, but it was a, it was a recording of a teacher

07:45.020 --> 07:49.460
flipping out at kids, questioning gender identity or gender theory.

07:49.460 --> 07:54.080
So the idea is you have like a woke millennial teacher who really wants to teach the, the

07:54.080 --> 07:55.080
trans stuff.

07:55.080 --> 07:59.000
And I think these are like, like upper aged elementary school students.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.160
We're talking like grade seven, grade eight, you know, you know, just before high school.

08:03.160 --> 08:04.580
That's what it seems like anyway.

08:04.580 --> 08:08.900
And the kids, they're not fucking having it like, damn, maybe, maybe the youth would be

08:08.900 --> 08:15.240
all right after all.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.240
Who was upset?

08:16.240 --> 08:17.240
The teacher

08:17.240 --> 08:26.920
That's a bit much, oh, we didn't say that.

08:26.920 --> 08:31.920
That clicking in the audio.

08:31.920 --> 08:32.920
It's good to question their identity

08:32.920 --> 08:57.240
Gender is not linked to do with not linked gender is about how you identify, which is

08:57.240 --> 09:04.200
what I said, right from the very who cares how you identify biological biological sex.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.200
There is actually three logical sex.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.800
You can be born into sex.

09:08.800 --> 09:13.560
You can be born with male and female body parts or hormones.

09:13.560 --> 09:14.560
Yeah.

09:14.560 --> 09:23.160
But most trans people are intersex, in terms of gender, there are lots of genders, lots

09:23.160 --> 09:24.160
of made up shit.

09:24.160 --> 09:31.520
There is a gender people who don't believe they have a gender at all.

09:31.520 --> 09:32.520
Yeah.

09:32.520 --> 09:35.520
We just don't agree with that.

09:35.520 --> 09:38.520
We have a giant year ago.

09:38.520 --> 09:39.520
Yeah.

09:39.520 --> 09:43.520
But cisgender is not necessarily the way to be.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.520
Oh, my God.

09:45.520 --> 09:53.360
But you identify with the gender that of the sexual order that you're born with, or you're

09:54.360 --> 09:57.400
I mean, yeah, it is kind of weird, but it's fine to be weird, dude.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.400
It's okay.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.400
I'm right now.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.400
I'm here.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.400
My mom.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.400
That's very sad as well, though.

10:02.400 --> 10:03.400
How is it?

10:03.400 --> 10:04.400
Loads of people agree with that.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.520
There's only a small majority of people who actually think a small majority.

10:07.520 --> 10:08.520
Come on.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.520
Hold on.

10:09.520 --> 10:10.520
Come on, kid.

10:10.520 --> 10:11.520
With homophobia.

10:11.520 --> 10:16.520
I'm fine with lesbians and gay people.

10:16.520 --> 10:23.120
I've got nothing against that gender is is what this is painful, guys.

10:23.880 --> 10:24.880
Oh, Jesus.

10:24.880 --> 10:25.880
No, they can't.

10:25.880 --> 10:26.880
They can't.

10:26.880 --> 10:27.880
Unless you get a penis attached.

10:27.880 --> 10:28.880
No, I'm not.

10:28.880 --> 10:29.880
You're confusing sex and gender.

10:29.880 --> 10:30.880
No, I'm not, though.

10:30.880 --> 10:31.880
Because if you have a vagina, you're a girl.

10:31.880 --> 10:32.880
If you have a penis, you're a woman.

10:32.880 --> 10:33.880
Yeah.

10:33.880 --> 10:34.880
You can't have a vagina.

10:34.880 --> 10:35.880
Oh, God.

10:35.880 --> 10:36.880
Even then, because you've got those genes.

10:36.880 --> 10:37.880
I mean, it's actually great this is being recorded.

10:37.880 --> 10:38.880
It's not an opinion.

10:38.880 --> 10:39.880
Yes, it is.

10:39.880 --> 10:40.880
Yes, it is.

10:40.880 --> 10:41.880
No, it's not.

10:41.880 --> 10:42.880
And if you don't like it, you need to go to a different school.

10:42.880 --> 10:43.880
Oh, get out of the school if you don't like it.

10:43.880 --> 10:52.880
You need to have a proper educational conversation about equality, diversity, and inclusion.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.880
Keep gigachatting, kids.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.880
You can be who you want to be.

10:56.880 --> 10:57.880
Everyone else can be.

10:57.880 --> 10:58.880
How you identify is up to you.

10:58.880 --> 10:59.880
Everyone else thinks it.

10:59.880 --> 11:00.880
They just don't play it.

11:00.880 --> 11:01.880
Because they're always at it.

11:01.880 --> 11:02.880
Maybe because they're polite, and maybe they're sensitive.

11:02.880 --> 11:03.880
I don't know.

11:03.880 --> 11:04.880
I don't know.

11:04.880 --> 11:05.880
I don't know.

11:05.880 --> 11:06.880
I don't know.

11:06.880 --> 11:07.880
I don't know.

11:07.880 --> 11:08.880
I don't know.

11:08.880 --> 11:09.880
I don't know.

11:09.880 --> 11:10.880
I don't know.

11:10.880 --> 11:11.880
I don't know.

11:12.880 --> 11:13.880
I don't know.

11:13.880 --> 11:14.880
I don't know.

11:14.880 --> 11:15.880
I don't know.

11:15.880 --> 11:16.880
I don't know.

11:16.880 --> 11:17.880
Maybe because they're polite and maybe they're sensitive.

11:17.880 --> 11:18.880
I haven't said anything of all the lessons I've been in.

11:18.880 --> 11:19.880
It's just because they turned around and started saying something.

11:19.880 --> 11:20.880
So I said, how can you identify as a cat when you're a girl?

11:20.880 --> 11:21.880
Yeah.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.880
When they're not writing a statement, I would imagine that you'll be asked to write a statement

11:23.880 --> 11:24.880
as well.

11:24.880 --> 11:25.880
We will.

11:25.880 --> 11:26.880
We will.

11:26.880 --> 11:27.880
We will.

11:28.880 --> 11:29.880
Based.

11:29.880 --> 11:32.680
That teacher's just completely captured.

11:32.680 --> 11:39.200
Man, I don't often say this because I think conservatives tend to overplay their hand

11:39.200 --> 11:41.960
on this point, but in this case, I will say it.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.580
You got to get your kids out of that classroom.

11:43.580 --> 11:46.660
And if you're if you're a kid in that classroom, you got it.

11:46.660 --> 11:50.580
You got to understand that you on some level, you are definitely being lied to

11:50.580 --> 11:53.160
or maybe not not lied to because they think it's real.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.680
But, you know, ideologically indoctrinated. That was wild.

11:57.880 --> 12:01.760
Man, another robbery, one lots of robbery, one said this week, guys, they're good.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.640
Look at them stealing.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.000
Really, bro?

12:08.000 --> 12:11.800
You got to resort to this economy is not that bad.

12:14.180 --> 12:16.100
Wait, it's all like cleaning supplies.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.020
They use it for drugs, maybe.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.980
Holy shit.

12:22.360 --> 12:24.360
Maybe the house is really dirty.

12:24.360 --> 12:27.900
Better get it while the getting's good.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.440
Oh, shit. Oh, man.

12:30.440 --> 12:31.740
They covered the.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.980
Oh, wait, they leave the guy behind.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.600
Oh, my God. They got the plate.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.640
They got somebody run that plate.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.680
You got to stop these fucks.

12:45.680 --> 12:49.520
I know, like in previous TikTok Tuesdays, people kept saying,

12:49.700 --> 12:52.560
what are the race of the people involved to have one of the race?

12:52.860 --> 12:56.020
And yeah, there's definitely a disproportionate amount of black people

12:56.020 --> 13:00.900
doing this, generally because of the culture and the neighborhoods.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.740
Maybe the maybe the economic conditions.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.320
It's obviously not genetics, like that's fucking stupid.

13:06.580 --> 13:10.420
But yeah, it seems like since stealing is

13:10.820 --> 13:14.740
apparently not being punished right now, everyone who's a thief is getting in on it.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.420
All right, guys, that's the end of it for me.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.420
I know I skipped last week or something, but I'm glad to be back.

13:20.580 --> 13:23.500
If you want to send me more TikTok Tuesdays content,

13:23.840 --> 13:26.260
hit me up on Discord, hit me up on Twitter.

13:26.540 --> 13:29.180
I do have the original SFO Twitter account back,

13:29.180 --> 13:32.260
but it's actually been shadowbanned, so you have to like come to my profile.

13:32.420 --> 13:36.300
But the Morbius Devo account has been has been destroyed.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.760
I flew too close to the sun on that one.

13:38.760 --> 13:41.140
All right. I'll be streaming something or other tonight.

13:41.140 --> 13:42.640
I don't know what it is yet. I guess we'll see.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.640
And yes, more videos are coming as well.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.320
I'm working on those this afternoon.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.560
All right. Have a good one, everyone.

13:48.560 --> 13:49.240
I love you.
