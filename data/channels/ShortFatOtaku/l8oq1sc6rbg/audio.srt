00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,560
Hello, you greasy goblins, welcome to TikTok Tuesday.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,040
I know I try to have TikTok Tuesday out at noon, this is definitely not coming out at

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,800
noon because, well, that's when I'm recording it.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,080
So this will be coming out a little bit later in the day, maybe even in time for tonight's

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,080
stream.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,080
That's alright though.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
Let's get to it.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,400
What kind of nonsense have you guys sent me this week?

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,240
Oh, we're starting off with a fight today!

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,240
Damn.

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:36,880
Oh my god.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,760
Where's this guy recording this from?

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,240
He's like on a walkway above the store?

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:52,000
Damn, what the fuck, lady?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You deserve it?

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,480
You deserve to get thrown the fuck out.

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,880
What the fuck was- was she just going wild over booze?

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,440
Hold on, let me see here.

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,280
Yeah, maybe she's a shotlifter or something.

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,680
I mean, it doesn't look like she's too young to drink.

21
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,540
That's something that you see a lot of when there's like young people who are trying to

22
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,520
buy booze and they get caught because they've got like an underage ID or they're clearly

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,800
too young or something.

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,280
They start throwing a tantrum and destroying the liquor store or the liquor section of

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
the store.

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
This woman ain't that.

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,840
Yeah, maybe she's a shotlifter or something.

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,720
Let's talk about trans people using public bathrooms from a trans woman's perspective.

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,000
Hi, bestie.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,320
I think as a fellow trans woman, you would agree that the world is not made for us.

31
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,320
And I think you've made your opinion very clear that trans individuals can make other

32
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,060
people uncomfortable.

33
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,000
I would agree with that, but here's where you and I differ.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I don't care.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,560
I don't exist to make the cis world comfortable.

36
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,440
I'm here to change this world.

37
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:57,640
I'm here to live my life the way I want to, to make the next generation of trans people

38
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,280
make their life a little bit easier.

39
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,360
So while you want to limit yourself and you want to appease the world, I'll be out there

40
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,540
living my life and changing it.

41
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,540
So you have a great day.

42
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,540
Love you.

43
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,540
Bye.

44
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,540
Here's the thing.

45
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,540
I don't know how TikTok works.

46
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,120
It seems like this is like a reply from another person who's also on TikTok.

47
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,400
I think they call it a stitch over there.

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,000
Man, I don't understand it.

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,160
I'm too boomer for any of this shit.

50
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
I don't get it.

51
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,080
But it seems like it started off with one trans woman who was going to give her take

52
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,240
about trans women in women's bathrooms and then a second trans woman.

53
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,760
I guess that toque makes it kind of hard to tell, but a second trans woman who shows up

54
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
and is replying.

55
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,280
And I think stitching just means that the TikTok you're replying to, TikTok automatically

56
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,760
adds like the first five seconds of the video onto your video or something.

57
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't fucking know.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,720
But more importantly, check out this person's rhetoric.

59
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,600
As individuals can make other people uncomfortable.

60
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,480
I agree with that.

61
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,620
But here's where you and I differ.

62
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,720
I don't care.

63
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,180
I don't exist to make the cis world comfortable.

64
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,180
And there you have it.

65
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,280
This is somebody who knows that if they walk into a woman's bathroom and all of the cis

66
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,280
women in the bathroom are really upset by it.

67
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
This person doesn't care.

68
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,280
They just don't care.

69
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,280
They don't give a shit.

70
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,600
They would rather the vast majority of people bend to the whims of the minority for that

71
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
minority's comfort.

72
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,740
And this is something that I went into with Sargon and Adam and Sitch over on the Adam

73
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,940
and Sitch show on their channel, where basically I said in the real world, people don't actually

74
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,900
care about the trans bathroom issue.

75
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,320
As long as you pass.

76
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,540
When you get a trans woman who passes really well, the example that's always used is Blair

77
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,420
White, but any of them really that pass really well and they walk into a girl's room, no

78
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,380
one cares because they're not making it a political statement.

79
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,380
They're not doing this.

80
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,380
They're not here to change the world.

81
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,380
Bullshit.

82
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,880
They're just living a relatively normal life.

83
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,380
And outside of the internet, outside of all the bullshit ideology, that's how the trans

84
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,680
stuff actually works.

85
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,280
A trans woman counts as a woman if they pass.

86
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,200
And if they don't, then they count as a man.

87
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
That's how it is.

88
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,840
So let me know if this makes sense to you guys, but I just got done getting groceries

89
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
at the store.

90
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,240
And like, as I was walking out, this lady walks past me and she goes, Oh, Kanye shoes.

91
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
Really?

92
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
And like, I just stopped.

93
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
I looked at her.

94
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
I was like, what?

95
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,500
And she says, if you wear shoes made by Kanye, you're equally as much of a piece of shit

96
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
as he is.

97
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,740
And I was like, what?

98
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,020
Because first of all, I'm not even wearing Yeezys.

99
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,660
I'm wearing New Balances.

100
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,540
And second of all, there is no groceries.

101
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,540
What the fuck?

102
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,540
What?

103
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:41,140
What am I watching?

104
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:46,040
What is this fucking fever dream?

105
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,040
There's a fat guy in the background.

106
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,040
Okay.

107
00:04:52,040 --> 00:05:00,080
Oh, oh my.

108
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:09,480
Uh, wow.

109
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:15,340
That was, uh, that was the ultimate that happened story, I guess.

110
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,340
You know how sometimes you can like turn on a TikTok and someone's telling a story and

111
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,660
they're clearly either like hyper embellishing it or it just didn't happen.

112
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,260
And they're just making something up to try and go viral on their page.

113
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,220
I guess we've reached a peak meta irony with this shit, haven't we?

114
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,420
And now that I'm looking at it again, look at the background, dude.

115
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,420
Yeah.

116
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,420
He's clearly in front of like a boarded up store.

117
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,060
I just didn't notice the first time through.

118
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,720
I wonder how many closed K-marts there are across the United States or like targets or

119
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
whatever.

120
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
There's probably a lot of them.

121
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,560
A lot of these stores that are just closed up and become, you know, graffiti havens.

122
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,420
Oh shit.

123
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:58,880
It's the pride street in Brit bong land.

124
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
What's going on here?

125
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
The change in the flags.

126
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,960
You're taking the wrong fucking flag down mate.

127
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,380
At least you know that.

128
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,580
Oh man.

129
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,900
Even the, uh, even like the civil service guys, the, uh, you know, the public works

130
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,380
guys, they know that what they're doing, uh, doesn't exactly feel right, but Hey, it's

131
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,380
part of the job.

132
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,380
You got to do it.

133
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,600
I guess it's interesting that everyone who's in the like the lower echelons of society,

134
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,900
they all have an intuitive feeling that this doesn't, this doesn't sit well with them,

135
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,900
you know?

136
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,400
But they're doing it cause they're paid to do it.

137
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
I'm in shock.

138
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Look, what?

139
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Oh my good loving.

140
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Yup.

141
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Another robbery one.

142
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,400
I'm in shock.

143
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,240
They young as hell.

144
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,040
They got trash bags in their pockets.

145
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,640
They really taking the whole store security.

146
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:58,040
Dude, the worker's not paid enough to stop this.

147
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,500
You paid minimum in Nike store and Watts where the kids come in and rob and they don't

148
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,560
do absolutely nothing.

149
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,820
They are filling up a whole bag.

150
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
Do you hear me?

151
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,820
Yep.

152
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,300
She asked me if I want to save my card on file.

153
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,300
Thank you.

154
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,340
No, man.

155
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,340
It's disgraceful.

156
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,700
It is despicable behavior, but I mean, no one's stopping them, right?

157
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,700
That's just how it's going to be.

158
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,400
I mean, the employees don't get paid enough to stop them.

159
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,240
If the store security is not stopping them, if the cops aren't showing up, I mean, what

160
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
do you expect?

161
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,640
There has to be some kind of punishment for being a thief, but right now there just isn't.

162
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
Oh yeah.

163
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:45,020
This one, this is from turning point UK, but it was a, it was a recording of a teacher

164
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,460
flipping out at kids, questioning gender identity or gender theory.

165
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,080
So the idea is you have like a woke millennial teacher who really wants to teach the, the

166
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
trans stuff.

167
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,000
And I think these are like, like upper aged elementary school students.

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,160
We're talking like grade seven, grade eight, you know, you know, just before high school.

169
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,580
That's what it seems like anyway.

170
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,900
And the kids, they're not fucking having it like, damn, maybe, maybe the youth would be

171
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:15,240
all right after all.

172
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,240
Who was upset?

173
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
The teacher

174
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:26,920
That's a bit much, oh, we didn't say that.

175
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,920
That clicking in the audio.

176
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
It's good to question their identity

177
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:57,240
Gender is not linked to do with not linked gender is about how you identify, which is

178
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:04,200
what I said, right from the very who cares how you identify biological biological sex.

179
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,200
There is actually three logical sex.

180
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,800
You can be born into sex.

181
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,560
You can be born with male and female body parts or hormones.

182
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
Yeah.

183
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:23,160
But most trans people are intersex, in terms of gender, there are lots of genders, lots

184
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
of made up shit.

185
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:31,520
There is a gender people who don't believe they have a gender at all.

186
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,520
Yeah.

187
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,520
We just don't agree with that.

188
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,520
We have a giant year ago.

189
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,520
Yeah.

190
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,520
But cisgender is not necessarily the way to be.

191
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,520
Oh, my God.

192
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:53,360
But you identify with the gender that of the sexual order that you're born with, or you're

193
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,400
I mean, yeah, it is kind of weird, but it's fine to be weird, dude.

194
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
It's okay.

195
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
I'm right now.

196
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
I'm here.

197
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
My mom.

198
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
That's very sad as well, though.

199
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
How is it?

200
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Loads of people agree with that.

201
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,520
There's only a small majority of people who actually think a small majority.

202
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,520
Come on.

203
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
Hold on.

204
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
Come on, kid.

205
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,520
With homophobia.

206
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,520
I'm fine with lesbians and gay people.

207
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:23,120
I've got nothing against that gender is is what this is painful, guys.

208
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,880
Oh, Jesus.

209
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
No, they can't.

210
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
They can't.

211
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
Unless you get a penis attached.

212
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,880
No, I'm not.

213
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
You're confusing sex and gender.

214
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,880
No, I'm not, though.

215
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
Because if you have a vagina, you're a girl.

216
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,880
If you have a penis, you're a woman.

217
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,880
Yeah.

218
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,880
You can't have a vagina.

219
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,880
Oh, God.

220
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,880
Even then, because you've got those genes.

221
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,880
I mean, it's actually great this is being recorded.

222
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
It's not an opinion.

223
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Yes, it is.

224
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
Yes, it is.

225
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
No, it's not.

226
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
And if you don't like it, you need to go to a different school.

227
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
Oh, get out of the school if you don't like it.

228
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:52,880
You need to have a proper educational conversation about equality, diversity, and inclusion.

229
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
Keep gigachatting, kids.

230
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
You can be who you want to be.

231
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Everyone else can be.

232
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
How you identify is up to you.

233
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
Everyone else thinks it.

234
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
They just don't play it.

235
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
Because they're always at it.

236
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
Maybe because they're polite, and maybe they're sensitive.

237
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
I don't know.

238
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
I don't know.

239
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
I don't know.

240
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
I don't know.

241
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
I don't know.

242
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
I don't know.

243
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
I don't know.

244
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
I don't know.

245
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,880
I don't know.

246
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
I don't know.

247
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
I don't know.

248
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
I don't know.

249
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
I don't know.

250
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,880
Maybe because they're polite and maybe they're sensitive.

251
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
I haven't said anything of all the lessons I've been in.

252
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
It's just because they turned around and started saying something.

253
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
So I said, how can you identify as a cat when you're a girl?

254
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
Yeah.

255
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,880
When they're not writing a statement, I would imagine that you'll be asked to write a statement

256
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
as well.

257
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
We will.

258
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
We will.

259
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
We will.

260
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Based.

261
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,680
That teacher's just completely captured.

262
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:39,200
Man, I don't often say this because I think conservatives tend to overplay their hand

263
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,960
on this point, but in this case, I will say it.

264
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,580
You got to get your kids out of that classroom.

265
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,660
And if you're if you're a kid in that classroom, you got it.

266
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,580
You got to understand that you on some level, you are definitely being lied to

267
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,160
or maybe not not lied to because they think it's real.

268
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,680
But, you know, ideologically indoctrinated. That was wild.

269
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,760
Man, another robbery, one lots of robbery, one said this week, guys, they're good.

270
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,640
Look at them stealing.

271
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,000
Really, bro?

272
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,800
You got to resort to this economy is not that bad.

273
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,100
Wait, it's all like cleaning supplies.

274
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,020
They use it for drugs, maybe.

275
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,980
Holy shit.

276
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,360
Maybe the house is really dirty.

277
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,900
Better get it while the getting's good.

278
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,440
Oh, shit. Oh, man.

279
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,740
They covered the.

280
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,980
Oh, wait, they leave the guy behind.

281
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,600
Oh, my God. They got the plate.

282
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,640
They got somebody run that plate.

283
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,680
You got to stop these fucks.

284
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,520
I know, like in previous TikTok Tuesdays, people kept saying,

285
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,560
what are the race of the people involved to have one of the race?

286
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,020
And yeah, there's definitely a disproportionate amount of black people

287
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,900
doing this, generally because of the culture and the neighborhoods.

288
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,740
Maybe the maybe the economic conditions.

289
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,320
It's obviously not genetics, like that's fucking stupid.

290
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,420
But yeah, it seems like since stealing is

291
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,740
apparently not being punished right now, everyone who's a thief is getting in on it.

292
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,420
All right, guys, that's the end of it for me.

293
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,420
I know I skipped last week or something, but I'm glad to be back.

294
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,500
If you want to send me more TikTok Tuesdays content,

295
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,260
hit me up on Discord, hit me up on Twitter.

296
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,180
I do have the original SFO Twitter account back,

297
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,260
but it's actually been shadowbanned, so you have to like come to my profile.

298
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,300
But the Morbius Devo account has been has been destroyed.

299
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,760
I flew too close to the sun on that one.

300
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,140
All right. I'll be streaming something or other tonight.

301
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,640
I don't know what it is yet. I guess we'll see.

302
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,640
And yes, more videos are coming as well.

303
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,320
I'm working on those this afternoon.

304
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,560
All right. Have a good one, everyone.

305
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,240
I love you.
