1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,620
This is the kind of story that I think I should be covering on an alt channel, where I do

2
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,860
reviews and gaming news and whatever.

3
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,740
But one, despite it being about Overwatch, this does have a healthy dose of social justice

4
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,740
in it.

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,520
And two, I haven't completely set up the alt channel yet.

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,340
When the quartering called me lazy on his podcast yesterday, he wasn't wrong.

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,560
If you've been following me for a while, you've probably picked up on the fact that

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,760
my girlfriend and I are fans of Overwatch.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,000
Uh, rather large fans, to be frank.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,440
I like the way the game plays.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,320
I like the personality of the characters.

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,660
I like the competitive scene.

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,640
And despite how Xbox Live-y the voice chat can get, I like the community too.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,440
I don't mind shit talking during a competitive game.

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,840
It's part of the game.

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,760
Overwatch's competitive scene is judged by SR ranking.

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,440
The people who have the 500 highest SR scores appear on the in-game leaderboards.

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,060
Looking at a recent snapshot of the top 10, I see a few familiar names, including pro

19
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,360
players like Sinatra and Kariv.

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,000
But this individual here, Ellie, appeared out of nowhere.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,420
She's unknown in the scene.

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,240
She's not a streamer or a pro player.

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,240
And at this high of a ranking, everybody knows everybody.

24
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,320
Even if you don't stream or don't play pro, you're going to be constantly appearing

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,480
in the games of other top tier streamers.

26
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,360
And people who watch are going to get to know who you are a little bit.

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,640
What made Ellie a unique case isn't that she was a girl, although there aren't as

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,960
many women in the top 500 as there are men.

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,960
It was the fact that she was virtually unknown to the community, as if she simply appeared

30
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,880
fully formed in the top ranks.

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,560
Naturally, people were suspicious.

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,880
And naturally, social justice warriors and game journos on Twitter called this suspicion

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:58,640
sexism.

34
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,120
I'm sure some people were actually sexist.

35
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,800
But let's be real here, anybody coming out of nowhere in the top 500 is unheard of, regardless

36
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
of gender.

37
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,520
Combine that with the fact that Ellie had a relatively attractive sounding voice, and

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,700
a brand new Twitch and Twitter quickly springing up around her.

39
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,000
To the more skeptical people out there, it really seemed like a cash grab.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,520
Think of it, an attractive, young, top level Overwatch player blinks into existence with

41
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,480
a rapidly growing following and quickly opening donation pages.

42
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,680
Seems too good to be true.

43
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,600
It's not sexism to suspect that something may be off about this situation.

44
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,180
And it's not sexism to understand that a good looking woman on the internet, with skill

45
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,220
in her chosen field, represents a gold mine.

46
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,000
That's why the most famous cosplayers out there are all women.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
That's why female porn stars make more than male ones.

48
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,460
That's why Twitch thoughts and premium snaps are a thing.

49
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,820
And obviously it's fine to use your looks to turn a profit, but in all of these fields,

50
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,640
a lot of that profit comes from downtrodden men who genuinely and misguidedly believe

51
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,200
that throwing money at these women will somehow improve their lives.

52
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,900
That delusion is their fault, of course, but the internet reacts very strongly, and rightfully

53
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,300
so, when somebody comes along attempting to exploit that delusion for a quick buck.

54
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,720
That's why the thought audit went viral, and that's why the extremely transparent

55
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,660
Ellie received such a negative backlash.

56
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,980
But that didn't stop the cucklords in the gaming and culture war press from activating

57
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,980
the spin cycle.

58
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,560
On the Mary Sue, Jesus Christ people, aren't you as exhausted by this as I am?

59
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,620
At the end of December, Ellie was announced as a new member of Second Wind, a team in

60
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,280
Overwatch's official contender's minor league, and Lo, the toxic internet folks with

61
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,540
far too much sexism on their hands, kicked into immediate gear.

62
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,820
But the problem wasn't sexism, it's that Ellie was getting signed to a pro team, a

63
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,020
prestigious position with opportunity, even though nobody had verified her identity.

64
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,980
If you actually look at the Overwatch League, every player signed to a team has their real

65
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,500
name and information publicly available as part of the roster.

66
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,740
Ellie though, remained unconfirmed.

67
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,760
Ask yourself if any of this would have happened if Ellie had emerged with the moniker Elio.

68
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,660
Ellie did her best to counter the people who devoted their limited life energy to questioning

69
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,980
her existence, because something something girls in video games.

70
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,380
Surely this pro lady gamer must actually be a man.

71
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,220
It's not about her being a man.

72
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,700
If an unknown anonymous male sounding name appeared on the top 500, the same questions

73
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,740
would be asked.

74
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,680
Is this the alt account of a pro player?

75
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,700
Is the person I'm facing off against actually this anonymous persona of Elio?

76
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,620
Or is it somebody that I would otherwise know?

77
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,460
A handful of other Overwatch pros even got involved, with Atlanta Rain player Daniel

78
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,920
Draphan-Francesca speculating during a stream that someone is playing on this account and

79
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,740
Ellie is talking right beside them.

80
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:46,020
Listen, Draphan, why do you write his internet handle as if you're using it is somehow an

81
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,020
insult?

82
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,100
I know this might blow your mind, but not everyone has so much investment in the video

83
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,500
game Overwatch that they're out to pull off a gender long con for reasons unknown.

84
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,020
How exactly does this alleged hoax even benefit a fake Ellie?

85
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,660
It's pretty obvious to me.

86
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,660
Money.

87
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,660
Subs.

88
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,660
Stream donations.

89
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,660
Opportunities.

90
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,660
Attention.

91
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,700
To drive home the idea that the man playing as a lady is in fact a lady, with all those

92
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,740
rewards and accolades that come from being one in gaming circles, they draft a real female

93
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,200
to serve as their voice?

94
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,560
That seems like some spectacular coordination.

95
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,580
That seems totally legit and plausible and like a thing that people might do with their

96
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,580
free time.

97
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,580
Hey.

98
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,580
Hey.

99
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,580
Hey MarySue.

100
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,860
Guess what?

101
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,580
That's exactly what they did.

102
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,700
Here's a clip from the stream of Aspen, a member of the esports team Cloud9.

103
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,700
And guess what?

104
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,700
A girl.

105
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,500
And although she's not in the top 500, she's still a girl with about 1500 more SR than

106
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,060
me, so I have no problem considering her my better, regardless of gender.

107
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,620
Alright, there's so much talk around this Ellie person, right?

108
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:58,700
Um, feel free to clip whatever I say, I seriously don't care, um.

109
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,380
Ellie is not Ellie, okay?

110
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,100
Ellie is not Ellie.

111
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:14,660
The whole situation was meant to be, in a way, like a social experiment.

112
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:21,300
Ellie is actually Punisher and he told me yesterday, so.

113
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,300
There you go.

114
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Hello Reddit.

115
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,260
Yeah, Ellie is Punisher.

116
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,660
He did this for like a social experiment thing and did not expect it to get out of hand,

117
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,180
so that's kind of the juice around that.

118
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,300
That's all the juice.

119
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,780
So yeah, Ellie was fake all along.

120
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,300
People suspected another pro player, Punisher, of being Ellie for a while now, popularized

121
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,180
by this incredibly conspiratorial looking flowchart.

122
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,700
It really does look like something you'd see pinned up in a manic detective's room

123
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,200
surrounded by dozens of empty coffee cups.

124
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,360
Consider this, the Overwatch League has one female player, Geguri.

125
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,240
And not only is she just in the league, she is, in my opinion, the best fucking Zarya

126
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,680
player in the world, maybe even the best Tank player in the world.

127
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,580
And Tank is a tough role to fill because you're not sitting in the back lines playing support,

128
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,640
you're leading your team, you're directing the flow of engagements, it's probably the

129
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,480
most demanding position in the game.

130
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,800
Geguri gained international recognition, as well as her spot on the Shanghai Dragons,

131
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,080
because two pro players accused her of hacking.

132
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,200
Unlike Ellie, who crumpled into a ball on social media and had to be rescued by idiots

133
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,020
like the Mary Sue, and even Kotaku's own Nathan Grayson in an equally vapid article,

134
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,960
all before it came out that she was a fake, leaving her rescuers with egg on their faces,

135
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,100
Geguri proved that it was truly her behind the keyboard, and the two pros who baselessly

136
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,820
accused her left the professional scene entirely.

137
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,840
The same thing happened back in 2015 in Hearthstone, where people suspected Magic Amy, a young,

138
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,560
attractive, incredibly skilled player, to be a fake, based on a combination of extreme

139
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,360
strangeness and too-good-to-be-true hunches.

140
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,240
And like a clockwork, the progressive game journals came out with little proof but lots

141
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,720
of rhetoric in her defense.

142
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,220
Magic Amy, like Ellie, got offered a pro team spot.

143
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,460
Magic Amy, like Ellie, ended up being a fake operation run by a male player and a female

144
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,200
front in order to garner reputation, money, and pro opportunities.

145
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,720
And just like in Overwatch, this blind ideological defense of women in gaming wasn't even needed.

146
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,380
At the time, the best Hearthstone arena player in the entire world by win rate was Hafu,

147
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,380
a Chinese woman.

148
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,640
In order to compete in the top end of not just Overwatch, but any game, any field, any

149
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,400
sport, any business, whatever, you're going to have to prove yourself under some stressful

150
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,980
conditions at some point.

151
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,200
This rule doesn't change just because you're a woman, and the irrational haters you're

152
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,800
going to garner as a result of your success aren't suddenly sexist because you're

153
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
a woman either.

154
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,360
They're just jealous, like they are towards successful men.

155
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,400
Overwatch and Hearthstone aren't physically demanding like sports are.

156
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,880
There's no reason a woman can't be just as good as a man at these games.

157
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,760
Geguri and Hafu, along with many other professional esports women out there, have already proven

158
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
this.

159
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,020
If there's less women in esports than men, that simply means there's less women trying

160
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,240
to reach that apex level of skill out there.

161
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,640
At least, trying as hard as their male counterparts.

162
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,720
The SR ranking is not sexist.

163
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,600
If a person deserves to be in the top 500, they'll be there, gender be damned.

164
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,260
And every time an ideological male SJW fakes it, and is inevitably caught, all they do

165
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,660
is devalue the actual hard work that real women are doing to try and go pro.

166
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,780
What's really interesting to me is the admission on Aspen's stream that the whole Ellie thing

167
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:38,020
was a social experiment.

168
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,980
That sounds an awful lot like those women who are caught making false rape accusations

169
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,460
and offer up the defense of, I only wanted to start a dialogue, I only wanted to have

170
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,500
a conversation, I only wanted to draw attention to the rape epidemic on campus.

171
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,420
If you have to fake this sort of thing in order to get the conversation going, you're

172
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,100
doing more harm than good.

173
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,980
Because you're not allowing the problem you believe to exist rear its ugly head naturally

174
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,980
in the wild.

175
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,240
You're manufacturing it.

176
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,700
You become the cause of the problem you want to solve.

177
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,820
In believing that women can't make it without the male feminists' white knight attempts

178
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,660
to draw attention to their plight, they have become the sexist they claim to hate.
