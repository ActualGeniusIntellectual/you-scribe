WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.620
This is the kind of story that I think I should be covering on an alt channel, where I do

00:17.620 --> 00:19.860
reviews and gaming news and whatever.

00:19.860 --> 00:24.740
But one, despite it being about Overwatch, this does have a healthy dose of social justice

00:24.740 --> 00:25.740
in it.

00:25.740 --> 00:28.520
And two, I haven't completely set up the alt channel yet.

00:28.520 --> 00:32.340
When the quartering called me lazy on his podcast yesterday, he wasn't wrong.

00:32.340 --> 00:35.560
If you've been following me for a while, you've probably picked up on the fact that

00:35.560 --> 00:37.760
my girlfriend and I are fans of Overwatch.

00:37.760 --> 00:40.000
Uh, rather large fans, to be frank.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.440
I like the way the game plays.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.320
I like the personality of the characters.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.660
I like the competitive scene.

00:44.660 --> 00:48.640
And despite how Xbox Live-y the voice chat can get, I like the community too.

00:48.640 --> 00:51.440
I don't mind shit talking during a competitive game.

00:51.440 --> 00:52.840
It's part of the game.

00:52.840 --> 00:55.760
Overwatch's competitive scene is judged by SR ranking.

00:55.760 --> 01:00.440
The people who have the 500 highest SR scores appear on the in-game leaderboards.

01:00.440 --> 01:05.060
Looking at a recent snapshot of the top 10, I see a few familiar names, including pro

01:05.060 --> 01:07.360
players like Sinatra and Kariv.

01:07.360 --> 01:11.000
But this individual here, Ellie, appeared out of nowhere.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.420
She's unknown in the scene.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.240
She's not a streamer or a pro player.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.240
And at this high of a ranking, everybody knows everybody.

01:17.240 --> 01:20.320
Even if you don't stream or don't play pro, you're going to be constantly appearing

01:20.320 --> 01:22.480
in the games of other top tier streamers.

01:22.480 --> 01:25.360
And people who watch are going to get to know who you are a little bit.

01:25.360 --> 01:28.640
What made Ellie a unique case isn't that she was a girl, although there aren't as

01:28.640 --> 01:30.960
many women in the top 500 as there are men.

01:30.960 --> 01:34.960
It was the fact that she was virtually unknown to the community, as if she simply appeared

01:34.960 --> 01:36.880
fully formed in the top ranks.

01:36.880 --> 01:38.560
Naturally, people were suspicious.

01:38.560 --> 01:42.880
And naturally, social justice warriors and game journos on Twitter called this suspicion

01:42.880 --> 01:58.640
sexism.

01:58.640 --> 02:01.120
I'm sure some people were actually sexist.

02:01.120 --> 02:05.800
But let's be real here, anybody coming out of nowhere in the top 500 is unheard of, regardless

02:05.800 --> 02:06.800
of gender.

02:06.800 --> 02:10.520
Combine that with the fact that Ellie had a relatively attractive sounding voice, and

02:10.520 --> 02:13.700
a brand new Twitch and Twitter quickly springing up around her.

02:13.700 --> 02:17.000
To the more skeptical people out there, it really seemed like a cash grab.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.520
Think of it, an attractive, young, top level Overwatch player blinks into existence with

02:21.520 --> 02:25.480
a rapidly growing following and quickly opening donation pages.

02:25.480 --> 02:26.680
Seems too good to be true.

02:26.680 --> 02:30.600
It's not sexism to suspect that something may be off about this situation.

02:30.600 --> 02:34.180
And it's not sexism to understand that a good looking woman on the internet, with skill

02:34.180 --> 02:37.220
in her chosen field, represents a gold mine.

02:37.220 --> 02:40.000
That's why the most famous cosplayers out there are all women.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.560
That's why female porn stars make more than male ones.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.460
That's why Twitch thoughts and premium snaps are a thing.

02:45.460 --> 02:49.820
And obviously it's fine to use your looks to turn a profit, but in all of these fields,

02:49.820 --> 02:54.640
a lot of that profit comes from downtrodden men who genuinely and misguidedly believe

02:54.640 --> 02:58.200
that throwing money at these women will somehow improve their lives.

02:58.200 --> 03:02.900
That delusion is their fault, of course, but the internet reacts very strongly, and rightfully

03:02.900 --> 03:07.300
so, when somebody comes along attempting to exploit that delusion for a quick buck.

03:07.300 --> 03:10.720
That's why the thought audit went viral, and that's why the extremely transparent

03:10.720 --> 03:12.660
Ellie received such a negative backlash.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.980
But that didn't stop the cucklords in the gaming and culture war press from activating

03:15.980 --> 03:16.980
the spin cycle.

03:16.980 --> 03:21.560
On the Mary Sue, Jesus Christ people, aren't you as exhausted by this as I am?

03:21.560 --> 03:25.620
At the end of December, Ellie was announced as a new member of Second Wind, a team in

03:25.620 --> 03:30.280
Overwatch's official contender's minor league, and Lo, the toxic internet folks with

03:30.280 --> 03:33.540
far too much sexism on their hands, kicked into immediate gear.

03:33.540 --> 03:37.820
But the problem wasn't sexism, it's that Ellie was getting signed to a pro team, a

03:37.820 --> 03:42.020
prestigious position with opportunity, even though nobody had verified her identity.

03:42.020 --> 03:45.980
If you actually look at the Overwatch League, every player signed to a team has their real

03:45.980 --> 03:49.500
name and information publicly available as part of the roster.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.740
Ellie though, remained unconfirmed.

03:51.740 --> 03:55.760
Ask yourself if any of this would have happened if Ellie had emerged with the moniker Elio.

03:55.760 --> 03:59.660
Ellie did her best to counter the people who devoted their limited life energy to questioning

03:59.660 --> 04:02.980
her existence, because something something girls in video games.

04:02.980 --> 04:06.380
Surely this pro lady gamer must actually be a man.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.220
It's not about her being a man.

04:08.220 --> 04:12.700
If an unknown anonymous male sounding name appeared on the top 500, the same questions

04:12.700 --> 04:13.740
would be asked.

04:13.740 --> 04:15.680
Is this the alt account of a pro player?

04:15.680 --> 04:19.700
Is the person I'm facing off against actually this anonymous persona of Elio?

04:19.700 --> 04:21.620
Or is it somebody that I would otherwise know?

04:21.620 --> 04:26.460
A handful of other Overwatch pros even got involved, with Atlanta Rain player Daniel

04:26.460 --> 04:30.920
Draphan-Francesca speculating during a stream that someone is playing on this account and

04:30.920 --> 04:32.740
Ellie is talking right beside them.

04:32.740 --> 04:46.020
Listen, Draphan, why do you write his internet handle as if you're using it is somehow an

04:46.020 --> 04:47.020
insult?

04:47.020 --> 04:51.100
I know this might blow your mind, but not everyone has so much investment in the video

04:51.100 --> 04:55.500
game Overwatch that they're out to pull off a gender long con for reasons unknown.

04:55.500 --> 04:59.020
How exactly does this alleged hoax even benefit a fake Ellie?

04:59.020 --> 05:00.660
It's pretty obvious to me.

05:00.660 --> 05:01.660
Money.

05:01.660 --> 05:02.660
Subs.

05:02.660 --> 05:03.660
Stream donations.

05:03.660 --> 05:04.660
Opportunities.

05:04.660 --> 05:05.660
Attention.

05:05.660 --> 05:09.700
To drive home the idea that the man playing as a lady is in fact a lady, with all those

05:09.700 --> 05:14.740
rewards and accolades that come from being one in gaming circles, they draft a real female

05:14.740 --> 05:16.200
to serve as their voice?

05:16.200 --> 05:18.560
That seems like some spectacular coordination.

05:18.560 --> 05:22.580
That seems totally legit and plausible and like a thing that people might do with their

05:22.580 --> 05:23.580
free time.

05:23.580 --> 05:24.580
Hey.

05:24.580 --> 05:25.580
Hey.

05:25.580 --> 05:26.580
Hey MarySue.

05:26.580 --> 05:28.860
Guess what?

05:28.860 --> 05:30.580
That's exactly what they did.

05:30.580 --> 05:34.700
Here's a clip from the stream of Aspen, a member of the esports team Cloud9.

05:34.700 --> 05:35.700
And guess what?

05:35.700 --> 05:36.700
A girl.

05:36.700 --> 05:40.500
And although she's not in the top 500, she's still a girl with about 1500 more SR than

05:40.500 --> 05:44.060
me, so I have no problem considering her my better, regardless of gender.

05:44.060 --> 05:47.620
Alright, there's so much talk around this Ellie person, right?

05:47.620 --> 05:58.700
Um, feel free to clip whatever I say, I seriously don't care, um.

05:58.700 --> 06:03.380
Ellie is not Ellie, okay?

06:03.380 --> 06:06.100
Ellie is not Ellie.

06:06.100 --> 06:14.660
The whole situation was meant to be, in a way, like a social experiment.

06:14.660 --> 06:21.300
Ellie is actually Punisher and he told me yesterday, so.

06:21.300 --> 06:22.300
There you go.

06:22.300 --> 06:23.300
Hello Reddit.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.260
Yeah, Ellie is Punisher.

06:26.260 --> 06:31.660
He did this for like a social experiment thing and did not expect it to get out of hand,

06:31.660 --> 06:35.180
so that's kind of the juice around that.

06:35.180 --> 06:37.300
That's all the juice.

06:37.300 --> 06:39.780
So yeah, Ellie was fake all along.

06:39.780 --> 06:44.300
People suspected another pro player, Punisher, of being Ellie for a while now, popularized

06:44.300 --> 06:47.180
by this incredibly conspiratorial looking flowchart.

06:47.180 --> 06:50.700
It really does look like something you'd see pinned up in a manic detective's room

06:50.700 --> 06:53.200
surrounded by dozens of empty coffee cups.

06:54.100 --> 06:57.360
Consider this, the Overwatch League has one female player, Geguri.

06:57.360 --> 07:02.240
And not only is she just in the league, she is, in my opinion, the best fucking Zarya

07:02.240 --> 07:05.680
player in the world, maybe even the best Tank player in the world.

07:05.680 --> 07:09.580
And Tank is a tough role to fill because you're not sitting in the back lines playing support,

07:09.580 --> 07:12.640
you're leading your team, you're directing the flow of engagements, it's probably the

07:12.640 --> 07:14.480
most demanding position in the game.

07:14.480 --> 07:18.800
Geguri gained international recognition, as well as her spot on the Shanghai Dragons,

07:18.800 --> 07:21.080
because two pro players accused her of hacking.

07:21.080 --> 07:25.200
Unlike Ellie, who crumpled into a ball on social media and had to be rescued by idiots

07:25.200 --> 07:30.020
like the Mary Sue, and even Kotaku's own Nathan Grayson in an equally vapid article,

07:30.020 --> 07:33.960
all before it came out that she was a fake, leaving her rescuers with egg on their faces,

07:33.960 --> 07:38.100
Geguri proved that it was truly her behind the keyboard, and the two pros who baselessly

07:38.100 --> 07:40.820
accused her left the professional scene entirely.

07:40.820 --> 07:45.840
The same thing happened back in 2015 in Hearthstone, where people suspected Magic Amy, a young,

07:45.840 --> 07:49.560
attractive, incredibly skilled player, to be a fake, based on a combination of extreme

07:49.560 --> 07:52.360
strangeness and too-good-to-be-true hunches.

07:52.360 --> 07:56.240
And like a clockwork, the progressive game journals came out with little proof but lots

07:56.240 --> 07:57.720
of rhetoric in her defense.

07:57.720 --> 08:01.220
Magic Amy, like Ellie, got offered a pro team spot.

08:01.220 --> 08:06.460
Magic Amy, like Ellie, ended up being a fake operation run by a male player and a female

08:06.460 --> 08:10.200
front in order to garner reputation, money, and pro opportunities.

08:10.200 --> 08:15.720
And just like in Overwatch, this blind ideological defense of women in gaming wasn't even needed.

08:15.720 --> 08:20.380
At the time, the best Hearthstone arena player in the entire world by win rate was Hafu,

08:20.380 --> 08:21.380
a Chinese woman.

08:21.380 --> 08:26.640
In order to compete in the top end of not just Overwatch, but any game, any field, any

08:26.640 --> 08:30.400
sport, any business, whatever, you're going to have to prove yourself under some stressful

08:30.400 --> 08:31.980
conditions at some point.

08:31.980 --> 08:35.200
This rule doesn't change just because you're a woman, and the irrational haters you're

08:35.200 --> 08:38.800
going to garner as a result of your success aren't suddenly sexist because you're

08:38.800 --> 08:39.800
a woman either.

08:39.800 --> 08:42.360
They're just jealous, like they are towards successful men.

08:42.360 --> 08:45.400
Overwatch and Hearthstone aren't physically demanding like sports are.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.880
There's no reason a woman can't be just as good as a man at these games.

08:48.880 --> 08:53.760
Geguri and Hafu, along with many other professional esports women out there, have already proven

08:53.760 --> 08:54.760
this.

08:54.760 --> 08:58.020
If there's less women in esports than men, that simply means there's less women trying

08:58.020 --> 09:00.240
to reach that apex level of skill out there.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.640
At least, trying as hard as their male counterparts.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.720
The SR ranking is not sexist.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.600
If a person deserves to be in the top 500, they'll be there, gender be damned.

09:08.600 --> 09:13.260
And every time an ideological male SJW fakes it, and is inevitably caught, all they do

09:13.260 --> 09:17.660
is devalue the actual hard work that real women are doing to try and go pro.

09:17.660 --> 09:21.780
What's really interesting to me is the admission on Aspen's stream that the whole Ellie thing

09:21.780 --> 09:38.020
was a social experiment.

09:38.020 --> 09:41.980
That sounds an awful lot like those women who are caught making false rape accusations

09:41.980 --> 09:45.460
and offer up the defense of, I only wanted to start a dialogue, I only wanted to have

09:45.460 --> 09:49.500
a conversation, I only wanted to draw attention to the rape epidemic on campus.

09:49.500 --> 09:53.420
If you have to fake this sort of thing in order to get the conversation going, you're

09:53.420 --> 09:55.100
doing more harm than good.

09:55.100 --> 09:58.980
Because you're not allowing the problem you believe to exist rear its ugly head naturally

09:58.980 --> 09:59.980
in the wild.

09:59.980 --> 10:01.240
You're manufacturing it.

10:01.240 --> 10:03.700
You become the cause of the problem you want to solve.

10:03.700 --> 10:07.820
In believing that women can't make it without the male feminists' white knight attempts

10:07.820 --> 10:11.660
to draw attention to their plight, they have become the sexist they claim to hate.
