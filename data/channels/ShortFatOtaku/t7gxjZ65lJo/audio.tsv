0	17620	This is the kind of story that I think I should be covering on an alt channel, where I do
17620	19860	reviews and gaming news and whatever.
19860	24740	But one, despite it being about Overwatch, this does have a healthy dose of social justice
24740	25740	in it.
25740	28520	And two, I haven't completely set up the alt channel yet.
28520	32340	When the quartering called me lazy on his podcast yesterday, he wasn't wrong.
32340	35560	If you've been following me for a while, you've probably picked up on the fact that
35560	37760	my girlfriend and I are fans of Overwatch.
37760	40000	Uh, rather large fans, to be frank.
40000	41440	I like the way the game plays.
41440	43320	I like the personality of the characters.
43320	44660	I like the competitive scene.
44660	48640	And despite how Xbox Live-y the voice chat can get, I like the community too.
48640	51440	I don't mind shit talking during a competitive game.
51440	52840	It's part of the game.
52840	55760	Overwatch's competitive scene is judged by SR ranking.
55760	60440	The people who have the 500 highest SR scores appear on the in-game leaderboards.
60440	65060	Looking at a recent snapshot of the top 10, I see a few familiar names, including pro
65060	67360	players like Sinatra and Kariv.
67360	71000	But this individual here, Ellie, appeared out of nowhere.
71000	72420	She's unknown in the scene.
72420	74240	She's not a streamer or a pro player.
74240	77240	And at this high of a ranking, everybody knows everybody.
77240	80320	Even if you don't stream or don't play pro, you're going to be constantly appearing
80320	82480	in the games of other top tier streamers.
82480	85360	And people who watch are going to get to know who you are a little bit.
85360	88640	What made Ellie a unique case isn't that she was a girl, although there aren't as
88640	90960	many women in the top 500 as there are men.
90960	94960	It was the fact that she was virtually unknown to the community, as if she simply appeared
94960	96880	fully formed in the top ranks.
96880	98560	Naturally, people were suspicious.
98560	102880	And naturally, social justice warriors and game journos on Twitter called this suspicion
102880	118640	sexism.
118640	121120	I'm sure some people were actually sexist.
121120	125800	But let's be real here, anybody coming out of nowhere in the top 500 is unheard of, regardless
125800	126800	of gender.
126800	130520	Combine that with the fact that Ellie had a relatively attractive sounding voice, and
130520	133700	a brand new Twitch and Twitter quickly springing up around her.
133700	137000	To the more skeptical people out there, it really seemed like a cash grab.
137000	141520	Think of it, an attractive, young, top level Overwatch player blinks into existence with
141520	145480	a rapidly growing following and quickly opening donation pages.
145480	146680	Seems too good to be true.
146680	150600	It's not sexism to suspect that something may be off about this situation.
150600	154180	And it's not sexism to understand that a good looking woman on the internet, with skill
154180	157220	in her chosen field, represents a gold mine.
157220	160000	That's why the most famous cosplayers out there are all women.
160000	162560	That's why female porn stars make more than male ones.
162560	165460	That's why Twitch thoughts and premium snaps are a thing.
165460	169820	And obviously it's fine to use your looks to turn a profit, but in all of these fields,
169820	174640	a lot of that profit comes from downtrodden men who genuinely and misguidedly believe
174640	178200	that throwing money at these women will somehow improve their lives.
178200	182900	That delusion is their fault, of course, but the internet reacts very strongly, and rightfully
182900	187300	so, when somebody comes along attempting to exploit that delusion for a quick buck.
187300	190720	That's why the thought audit went viral, and that's why the extremely transparent
190720	192660	Ellie received such a negative backlash.
192660	195980	But that didn't stop the cucklords in the gaming and culture war press from activating
195980	196980	the spin cycle.
196980	201560	On the Mary Sue, Jesus Christ people, aren't you as exhausted by this as I am?
201560	205620	At the end of December, Ellie was announced as a new member of Second Wind, a team in
205620	210280	Overwatch's official contender's minor league, and Lo, the toxic internet folks with
210280	213540	far too much sexism on their hands, kicked into immediate gear.
213540	217820	But the problem wasn't sexism, it's that Ellie was getting signed to a pro team, a
217820	222020	prestigious position with opportunity, even though nobody had verified her identity.
222020	225980	If you actually look at the Overwatch League, every player signed to a team has their real
225980	229500	name and information publicly available as part of the roster.
229500	231740	Ellie though, remained unconfirmed.
231740	235760	Ask yourself if any of this would have happened if Ellie had emerged with the moniker Elio.
235760	239660	Ellie did her best to counter the people who devoted their limited life energy to questioning
239660	242980	her existence, because something something girls in video games.
242980	246380	Surely this pro lady gamer must actually be a man.
246380	248220	It's not about her being a man.
248220	252700	If an unknown anonymous male sounding name appeared on the top 500, the same questions
252700	253740	would be asked.
253740	255680	Is this the alt account of a pro player?
255680	259700	Is the person I'm facing off against actually this anonymous persona of Elio?
259700	261620	Or is it somebody that I would otherwise know?
261620	266460	A handful of other Overwatch pros even got involved, with Atlanta Rain player Daniel
266460	270920	Draphan-Francesca speculating during a stream that someone is playing on this account and
270920	272740	Ellie is talking right beside them.
272740	286020	Listen, Draphan, why do you write his internet handle as if you're using it is somehow an
286020	287020	insult?
287020	291100	I know this might blow your mind, but not everyone has so much investment in the video
291100	295500	game Overwatch that they're out to pull off a gender long con for reasons unknown.
295500	299020	How exactly does this alleged hoax even benefit a fake Ellie?
299020	300660	It's pretty obvious to me.
300660	301660	Money.
301660	302660	Subs.
302660	303660	Stream donations.
303660	304660	Opportunities.
304660	305660	Attention.
305660	309700	To drive home the idea that the man playing as a lady is in fact a lady, with all those
309700	314740	rewards and accolades that come from being one in gaming circles, they draft a real female
314740	316200	to serve as their voice?
316200	318560	That seems like some spectacular coordination.
318560	322580	That seems totally legit and plausible and like a thing that people might do with their
322580	323580	free time.
323580	324580	Hey.
324580	325580	Hey.
325580	326580	Hey MarySue.
326580	328860	Guess what?
328860	330580	That's exactly what they did.
330580	334700	Here's a clip from the stream of Aspen, a member of the esports team Cloud9.
334700	335700	And guess what?
335700	336700	A girl.
336700	340500	And although she's not in the top 500, she's still a girl with about 1500 more SR than
340500	344060	me, so I have no problem considering her my better, regardless of gender.
344060	347620	Alright, there's so much talk around this Ellie person, right?
347620	358700	Um, feel free to clip whatever I say, I seriously don't care, um.
358700	363380	Ellie is not Ellie, okay?
363380	366100	Ellie is not Ellie.
366100	374660	The whole situation was meant to be, in a way, like a social experiment.
374660	381300	Ellie is actually Punisher and he told me yesterday, so.
381300	382300	There you go.
382300	383300	Hello Reddit.
384300	386260	Yeah, Ellie is Punisher.
386260	391660	He did this for like a social experiment thing and did not expect it to get out of hand,
391660	395180	so that's kind of the juice around that.
395180	397300	That's all the juice.
397300	399780	So yeah, Ellie was fake all along.
399780	404300	People suspected another pro player, Punisher, of being Ellie for a while now, popularized
404300	407180	by this incredibly conspiratorial looking flowchart.
407180	410700	It really does look like something you'd see pinned up in a manic detective's room
410700	413200	surrounded by dozens of empty coffee cups.
414100	417360	Consider this, the Overwatch League has one female player, Geguri.
417360	422240	And not only is she just in the league, she is, in my opinion, the best fucking Zarya
422240	425680	player in the world, maybe even the best Tank player in the world.
425680	429580	And Tank is a tough role to fill because you're not sitting in the back lines playing support,
429580	432640	you're leading your team, you're directing the flow of engagements, it's probably the
432640	434480	most demanding position in the game.
434480	438800	Geguri gained international recognition, as well as her spot on the Shanghai Dragons,
438800	441080	because two pro players accused her of hacking.
441080	445200	Unlike Ellie, who crumpled into a ball on social media and had to be rescued by idiots
445200	450020	like the Mary Sue, and even Kotaku's own Nathan Grayson in an equally vapid article,
450020	453960	all before it came out that she was a fake, leaving her rescuers with egg on their faces,
453960	458100	Geguri proved that it was truly her behind the keyboard, and the two pros who baselessly
458100	460820	accused her left the professional scene entirely.
460820	465840	The same thing happened back in 2015 in Hearthstone, where people suspected Magic Amy, a young,
465840	469560	attractive, incredibly skilled player, to be a fake, based on a combination of extreme
469560	472360	strangeness and too-good-to-be-true hunches.
472360	476240	And like a clockwork, the progressive game journals came out with little proof but lots
476240	477720	of rhetoric in her defense.
477720	481220	Magic Amy, like Ellie, got offered a pro team spot.
481220	486460	Magic Amy, like Ellie, ended up being a fake operation run by a male player and a female
486460	490200	front in order to garner reputation, money, and pro opportunities.
490200	495720	And just like in Overwatch, this blind ideological defense of women in gaming wasn't even needed.
495720	500380	At the time, the best Hearthstone arena player in the entire world by win rate was Hafu,
500380	501380	a Chinese woman.
501380	506640	In order to compete in the top end of not just Overwatch, but any game, any field, any
506640	510400	sport, any business, whatever, you're going to have to prove yourself under some stressful
510400	511980	conditions at some point.
511980	515200	This rule doesn't change just because you're a woman, and the irrational haters you're
515200	518800	going to garner as a result of your success aren't suddenly sexist because you're
518800	519800	a woman either.
519800	522360	They're just jealous, like they are towards successful men.
522360	525400	Overwatch and Hearthstone aren't physically demanding like sports are.
525400	528880	There's no reason a woman can't be just as good as a man at these games.
528880	533760	Geguri and Hafu, along with many other professional esports women out there, have already proven
533760	534760	this.
534760	538020	If there's less women in esports than men, that simply means there's less women trying
538020	540240	to reach that apex level of skill out there.
540240	542640	At least, trying as hard as their male counterparts.
542640	544720	The SR ranking is not sexist.
544720	548600	If a person deserves to be in the top 500, they'll be there, gender be damned.
548600	553260	And every time an ideological male SJW fakes it, and is inevitably caught, all they do
553260	557660	is devalue the actual hard work that real women are doing to try and go pro.
557660	561780	What's really interesting to me is the admission on Aspen's stream that the whole Ellie thing
561780	578020	was a social experiment.
578020	581980	That sounds an awful lot like those women who are caught making false rape accusations
581980	585460	and offer up the defense of, I only wanted to start a dialogue, I only wanted to have
585460	589500	a conversation, I only wanted to draw attention to the rape epidemic on campus.
589500	593420	If you have to fake this sort of thing in order to get the conversation going, you're
593420	595100	doing more harm than good.
595100	598980	Because you're not allowing the problem you believe to exist rear its ugly head naturally
598980	599980	in the wild.
599980	601240	You're manufacturing it.
601240	603700	You become the cause of the problem you want to solve.
603700	607820	In believing that women can't make it without the male feminists' white knight attempts
607820	611660	to draw attention to their plight, they have become the sexist they claim to hate.
