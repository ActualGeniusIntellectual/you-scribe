0	3600	Welcome to SJ weekly for the 25th of November 2018
4500	9360	Today, I'm drinking. It's called 8 o'clock coffee. Let's let's give it a try
13120	18120	Hmm oh it's good coffee, but I didn't put enough milk in hold on a second
22180	24760	Yes in Canada milk comes in bags
30000	32000	Oh
40960	46880	There we go perfect, I know my baby I like I like sugar and and milk in my coffee
46880	50160	I know let's start with my friend low ping
50840	54660	He's an Italian chef making kissy fingers apparently
55180	61720	Let's see what you enjoy so much if a post starts with hey folks, you know, everything after it is going to suck hard shit
62340	66780	Yeah, it is one of those things, you know, like yass Queen's sleigh or
67500	72960	Maybe just maybe or let's unpack this a little bit. It's one of those things, right?
73700	75220	Hey folks
75220	76500	using mixed
76500	78140	capitalized slash
78140	82940	Capitalized letters to mock a point is super ableist and possibly classist
82940	88800	If you can't ridicule bigotry without resorting to bigotry like that need to work on yourself a lot
89100	94700	the problem with this type of reasoning aside from how ridiculously stupid it is is that
95500	100620	Eventually, you're gonna get to the point where you're not going to be able to describe the difference between good and bad
100800	105740	Because they will say that all the various descriptors of things that are good and things that are bad are
106180	111640	Oppressive because these people fundamentally don't believe in in hierarchy and in value systems
111780	116700	So if you don't have a hierarchy, you don't have a system of values. How can you judge? What is good?
116700	117780	And what is bad?
117780	122900	CNN's Don Lemon we have to stop humanizing people and realize that the biggest terror threat in this country is white men
123140	126020	Most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them
126060	130220	I'm gonna have a video probably one of those short bite-sized videos on this topic soon
130340	136740	But let's let's watch this and just see how ridiculous it actually is we messaged about this a little bit this weekend
136740	141500	I keep trying to point out to people not to demonize any one group or any one ethnicity
141620	147100	But we keep thinking that the biggest terror threat is something else some some people who are marching
147180	153980	You know towards the border like it's imminent and the last time they did this a couple hundred people came and they you know
154740	157580	Most of them did get into the country most of them tired
157580	160660	You know got tuckered out before they even made it to the border
162060	168980	So we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is
169700	175940	White men most of them radicalized right up to the right and we have to start doing something about them
175940	181460	There is no travel ban on them. There is no ban on you know, they had the Muslim ban
181460	184260	There is no white guy ban. So what do we do about that?
185020	189620	Can you imagine going on CNN and saying the exact same thing about black men
190700	195920	We have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is black men
196100	200320	Most of them radicalized to the left and we have to start doing something about them
200780	205340	Imagine saying that you would lose your job at CNN. You'd be escorted out of the building
205340	211020	You'd probably be shot in an alleyway somewhere. I really do love Twitter. It's it's the best source of stuff like this
211020	213020	Online
214180	219160	Trolling comes entirely from Americans. I see no trolling coming from Europeans or people from anywhere else in the world
220180	223220	someone needs to make a social study on why this is um
224220	228060	I'm I'm Canadian and I troll quite a bit online
228800	232280	No offense, but this anecdote is totally false obviously false
232940	237020	No offense to you, but you don't know what Europeans are like online because you're American
237020	241000	That's why so many people were triggered by this tweet. I'm English not American
241020	243020	but
243980	247580	Do you really think that Australians don't troll
248300	251980	Do you really think that anybody else doesn't troll on the internet?
252100	253580	Let's get down to business
253580	259700	University staff told that capital letters could frighten anxious students lecturers also urged to avoid
259980	267700	Negative language and using the word don't so you can't all caps anything now and you can't mix caps anything now
267780	273980	And you also can't use the word don't why is it that university students have less of a spine than five-year-olds
274300	281220	The memo warned that writing in uppercase letters a common method for drawing attention to key points could make the task seem
281660	284220	Intimidating and frighten the students into failure
284900	291020	Really, so you're going to fail because someone all caps a word or a sentence
291100	295540	Maybe maybe that's why I like here check this out. Check this out. I'm gonna start all caps thing. All right
297700	303500	There you go. I just all caps something and all I have to do is do this and then students will start to fail
303500	307900	Their exams, that's it. That's all you got to do. I mean, it's got nothing to do with studying
308060	314140	It's got nothing to do with attending your classes or or completing your assignments or any kind of preparation. No
314140	321700	Yeah, you want your students to fail just all caps that shit staff are encouraged not to use the word don't where possible
321860	322860	While
322860	325740	Overusing the word do is also discouraged
325780	332620	So you quite literally can't give any direction at all because if you can't tell someone to do something
332620	336780	You can't tell someone to to don't do something. What does that leave?
337100	343220	That's basically the entirety of human action an anonymous staff member told the Daily Express that the staff
343340	349440	Bulked at being asked to treat intelligent students like children. We are not doing our students any favors or this kind of nonsense
349440	352200	They told the newspaper. Absolutely. They're absolutely right
352720	360000	However, the university's vice chancellor professor Margaret a house said that press coverage had been overblown and that the guidelines in the memo was drawn
360000	363680	From national best practice teaching guidelines. Well, guess what?
364400	369120	Those national best practice teaching guidelines. They're fucking wrong
369440	375400	Let's talk about something else that is just blatantly false meet the woman bringing social justice to astrology
375760	381040	Well astrology is already a nonsense field so if you want to add more nonsense into it
381040	383040	I guess there's no harm, right?
383280	388600	Chani Nicholas is transforming horoscopes from quips about finding true love and stumbling into financial good fortune
389080	392280	To pointed calls to action. The future is female
392720	395740	I'm sorry lady, but you're not gonna be the one who makes it to Mars
395920	401120	She's transforming horoscopes into calls to action with a left-leaning social justice agenda
401560	408280	Based in LA, of course, she's fucking based in LA. She weaves activism into the majority of her writing. I mean
409400	414040	You could you could just write this stuff at this point man. All these people are like this
414240	419200	I'm basically an angry feminist who just happens to be into astrology and healing. Yeah, no shit
419200	422960	It's like those witches from a few weeks ago who are casting spells against Donald Trump
422960	428840	Here's an example of one of her horoscopes when a society chooses protection for some while denying dignity for all
428960	430960	We have forsaken the soul of the world
431660	439020	Imagine breaking open a fortune cookie and instead of getting any kind of advice about your life you get this it's like well
439980	445580	Fine, but what am I supposed to do about it? Like I can't do anything. I'm I'm just getting my Chinese food
445580	449880	I'm not I'm not capable of changing shit like this following the 2016 presidential election
449880	454820	These people wrote a piece suggesting that the outcome of the vote would be attributed to the fact that the month before
455300	461160	Aggressive Mars and power monger Pluto were both in Capricorn the sign that rules the patriarchy
461220	466500	This is all fucking stupidity. However, if the heavens themselves are against your ideology
467340	472960	It's time to give up. Let's skip across the pond and see my friend Sargon of Akkad get
473800	477620	Get dragged by the Kent anti-racism network
478220	483100	Cancel the far-right Sargon of Akkad meeting at the University of Kent. Apparently it's still going on
483140	484500	It's happening on on Wednesday
484500	491540	I guess some people are going to be there protesting at Kent anti-racism network condemns the decision made by the University of Kent to invite
491540	495840	Carl Benjamin also known as Sargon of Akkad to speak on campus later this month
496360	503820	Carl is a well-known far-right youtuber who openly supports Tommy Robinson and produces vile YouTube videos full of offensive language and imagery
503820	507160	Yeah, dude, those D&D streams. They're just fucking terrible
507160	514440	You know, I do got to say though people seem to nowadays use far-right as a synonym for asshole
514880	516880	It's just someone they don't like right
517440	521560	There's nothing about Sargon's politics that are far-right. He seems to be center-left
521560	527160	I'm a bit more left than he is, but he's still definitely within the realm of center-left
527640	532860	However to people like this anybody who is not hard left is far-right
533340	539540	Benjamin was banned from Twitter after instigating a misogynistic trolling campaign against MP Jess Phillips declaring
539540	540820	I wouldn't even rape you
540820	546740	I just have to ask would it have been more or less misogynistic if he said he would rape her
546740	552380	Kent Union tried to stop the meeting from going ahead believing his presence on campus would invite racial hatred and violence
552740	557620	However, the university's management have overruled student representatives and plan to allow the event to go ahead
557620	562460	Well good on them because it's free speech. You can think that absolutely everything Sargon says is
563100	568260	Ridiculous nonsense and if it is ridiculous nonsense, he will show it when he speaks
568660	571260	So just let him speak if he's a fool
571460	575940	You will be able to tell we stand with the students at UKC who are refusing to tolerate
576180	581300	Fascism on campus or anywhere else in our communities and we will support them in preventing this meeting from going ahead
581780	584900	It sounds like there's probably gonna be a protest
584900	589620	Maybe a few more soy boys are gonna rush the stage and Sargon can take another flag. Let's see the comments here
589620	593700	What's interesting to note is that only certain comments are showing up on this page
593860	599540	Obviously the ones made by the pages owner are showing up. Certainly this person here if they don't say no then protest
600260	603360	Fuck my life. Why first Milo now this so gross
603900	607180	There are boundaries in society for a reason some things are just not okay
607380	610540	Finally down at the bottom the first comment against this nonsense
610820	615460	When your ideology is built like a house of cards and completely indefensible to any other ideology
615460	621140	Then silencing is your only alternative the students will eventually find out why they have been lied to out in the real world
621140	624260	In order to see the majority of replies that are critical to this
624260	630020	You actually have to start opening up all these things and they only appear sometimes you get to really click to get to find them
630020	632460	Why on earth are you opposed to hearing things? You don't agree with?
632700	637980	How else would you acquire the relevant material with which to effectively argue against it if not by listening and analyzing it?
637980	641380	I mean that's pretty much true, but you have to dig to find this comment
641460	645580	But this week we have a second story relating to Britain and fatness
645580	650700	I was kicked off the Harry Potter ride for being too fat for the seats, by the way
650700	654980	Yes, that was a fat joke about Sargon. Please don't expel me from the mob my Don Jesus
655420	658740	I've never seen the soy boy face in a woman before but here it is
658740	664020	I refuse to take on the additional guilt of not having gotten into Harry Potter until I was 35
664340	670240	But I'll admit that despite the annoying JK Rowling versus native people scandal that I doubt you heard anything about
670440	674600	But I followed because I'm native. Are you fucking sure you're native? You look quite white
675120	679160	This is this like the Elizabeth Warren one-drop rule straight up
679160	683840	I am 1 16th native my grandfather's grandmother that basically means that I'm
684440	689060	1516 white and therefore I am white and you look whiter than I do lady
689120	694000	it was the depression and disgust surrounding Donald Trump's election that sent me into a
694520	700040	An YA a year fantasy endurance run where I went so far as to purchase an armchair
700320	704980	From my around-the-clock bedroom reading. I'm sure you had an armchair before Jesus Christ
705000	706640	You seem like you sit in it a lot
706640	711920	It should be no surprise that when three friends and I went to the Universal Studios just outside Los Angeles last month
711920	717960	I demanded that our first experience be the Wizarding World of Harry Potter as it was my first time at Universal Studios
717960	722880	I couldn't have possibly been more tickled to drink butter beer and visit all the Hogsmeade shops
722920	728680	I even purchased a $50 wand that I used in all the goofy little spell slots around the delightful town square
728680	732400	And you know what up until now this actually sounds like a bit of good wholesome fun
732560	739800	My dear friend Ruha who had been a guest on my woman of size podcast, but the discrimination against fat women's bodies
740200	745280	Wrote heads up. I was kicked off the Hogwarts ride because I didn't fit it was humiliating
745280	748260	But they gave me front-of-the-line passes to the rest of the rides at Universal
749100	755940	You do realize there's a safety consideration right if you're too heavy or you're too wide or you're too tall
756220	761900	Or you can't fit in the seats somehow and and they can't securely strap you into the ride
762660	769300	They can't let you go on. It's not about fat discrimination. It's about you not fucking dying on their watch
769900	774180	Like the fat lady I am big and loud and demanding and I absolutely refuse to vanish
774180	776180	How
776620	782260	Unfortunate for the rest of us I did with any new Hogwarts student would do after being warned that she might be excluded
782260	787500	I bounded into the line with my friends and we were soon dazzled by the intricate details of the Hogwarts School of Wizardry
788060	792240	Disappearing projections of Harry Ron and Hermione the pensieve inside Dumbledore's chambers
792240	793820	It was so exciting that I found myself
793820	798280	Chuckling and prancing like a schoolgirl going to her first dance when we reached the front of the line
798280	801300	We were perfectly placed in the ride four across and seats locked down
801300	806620	I glanced at my friends and we all cackled we made it I got on I'm not too Oh
808260	812740	One of the 20-something ride managers walked over and asked us all to step off because of a safety issue
812980	816100	We were ushered through a door to it looked like a backstage area
816500	821820	Where another 20-something employee rattle off a spiel about safety and three clicks and having to try out a safety seat
821820	825120	That's when we all knew that I hadn't actually made it on to the Hogwarts ride
825140	829340	You could always lose weight and come back to the park
829340	831140	And in fact if that is your goal
831140	836260	Maybe eating and drinking this stuff is not the way to go at the Universal Studios in Orlando
836260	841980	Florida the locking mechanisms on the Hogwarts ride were adjusted in 2010 to safely accommodate bigger bodies
842180	847480	But not before this man was inspired to lose weight so he could be allowed on board. That's wrong
848260	852460	Exclusion and shame are not motivational techniques their forms of bullying
853060	855820	Exclusion makes me a logical and educated person
856460	859380	Believe that I'm at fault for not fitting into this ride
859780	865700	Instead of recognizing that rides should accommodate all people's bodies shame is a good motivational technique
865700	868620	Although it is it is quite negative and sometimes it's inappropriate
869860	874760	Exclusion though can actually be quite positive because the point of exclusion is not to say
874940	878700	You can never get in the point of exclusion is to say
879180	882360	You currently don't have what it takes to get in
882400	885480	It's actually quite important to our society that people are are
885920	891920	Ranked on ability and if that means that exclusion is a force at play then that is how it has to be
892040	894960	We are better off. It's not a form of bullying
894960	899480	It's a form of filtering and I know that I'm getting a bit serious here because we're not talking about
900000	902000	important positions that need to be filled
902360	904080	We're just talking about a ride
904080	911600	But the same idea applies from Gawker horse genitals taste of hay and more curious delights from a horse fucker
913360	920240	Kelly Conaboy filed to horse fuckers. I'm not gonna fucking read this one. Fuck you
920880	922960	Jesus the first transgender man
924720	926720	Somehow this is a better alternative
926920	930920	The church teaches that Jesus is the new Adam born of the new Eve
931400	937840	Eve is a fascinating creature for many reasons. The Bible tells us she is the first example of human cloning
937880	941620	I can kind of see that being the case if she's just taken from the rib of Adam
941800	948440	That's kind of clone like isn't it fun doesn't stop there if we take the Genesis account in its literal meaning as conservative Christians demand
948440	951160	That we do she is also the first case of a transgender woman
951240	958480	God reached into Adam pulled out a bit of rib bone and grew Eve from that XY DNA into Adams companion
958680	963360	She was created genetically male and yet transformed into a woman
967840	974680	You want me to open and we to open the real lemon juice you can't open the cap. Are you serious?
977120	979600	That was the easiest thing to open why did you
981280	988400	Then along comes Jesus and the whole pattern is both repeated and reversed the first couple's refusal to cooperate is turned around by
988400	989120	Mary's yes
989120	995200	And the second act of cloning occurs the Holy Spirit comes upon the second Eve and the child takes flesh from her and is born
995400	1001520	Born of her flesh born with XX chromosome pairing born genetically female and yet
1002080	1005720	transformed into man, so this hot take is basically that
1006640	1008200	whenever God
1008200	1014760	Spontaneously creates creatures if he doesn't using pieces of other creatures that DNA is transferred over
1014760	1016560	I mean, I guess it makes sense
1016560	1022640	But this is a stupid fucking conversation to be having isn't it and speaking of reproducing with only one set of DNA
1023480	1030880	Remember last week there was that woman who married herself. Yeah. Well, uh woman who married herself cheats on herself
1034940	1037480	To many adultery is no laughing matter
1037760	1042720	But a British woman who married herself two years ago has prompted much mockery and mirth
1042960	1047400	From viewers of this morning by announcing that she had been unfaithful to herself
1048160	1050160	You couldn't even keep it in your pants
1050680	1051680	a
1051680	1059280	Sophie Tanner revealed to the host that she had cheated on herself with Ruari Barrett a polyamorous who is now also married to himself
1062160	1064160	You guys could have married each other
1066200	1068920	The practice of marrying oneself known as
1069280	1076120	Solagamy is grown is growing in popularity in the UK with many women choosing to have a full ceremony to commemorate the event
1076560	1079580	Tanner's father was even present to give away Sophie as a bride
1080800	1083860	Self-marriages are not legally recognized by any official bodies
1084040	1087840	But proponents say it amounts to more than the height of generation selfies
1088120	1093440	Narcissism if you can't even maintain the marriage covenant with one person involved
1093440	1096040	How do you think you'd actually be able to handle it with two?
1096560	1098560	This week is so fucking stupid
1099080	1105280	It was recently Thanksgiving in the United States. And apparently the story of Thanksgiving is the story of a migrant caravan
1105400	1113200	Oh great. The caravan is here. That's actually kind of funny consider a classic text of our literature the memoir of plymouth plantation
1113200	1117620	written by William Bradford the first governor of the plymouth colony in Massachusetts
1118020	1120020	Bradford recalls how he and his fellow pilgrims
1120720	1127740	Refugees who had undertaken a perilous journey to flee religious and political oppression in Europe arrived on the Mayflower ship in 1620
1128200	1131040	Let's call this a kind of migrant caravan
1131040	1132480	It's
1132480	1138880	Not quite the same thing. I can see why you're drawing parallels, but there are also a few significant differences, aren't there?
1138960	1142000	Let's take a look at the one country in South America
1142000	1148160	That is not sending migrant caravans, but frankly if they were the United States should probably accept them
1148800	1153200	progressives should admit socialism failed even the Venezuelan president did
1153840	1158660	Surprisingly Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro admitted that socialism has ruined his country
1159180	1166600	Well, you're a fucking idiot then aren't you mr. Empanada here got rich and fat while destroying his country this week Maduro
1166600	1171160	Blamed the Socialist United Party for the failed state of the nation. The economy is a complete wreck
1171860	1176340	Socialism wrecks countries bring disaster and misery to the citizens and it's true
1177060	1181460	Venezuela is a pretty good example of socialism in action and any kind of
1181860	1187720	University student social justice soy boy that tells you that Venezuelan socialism isn't real socialism
1187800	1193160	They are simply little Maduro's in waiting and speaking of just shit
1194120	1196640	Millennials are making pooping cool again
1197240	1200560	Our bodies weren't meant to poop on porcelain thrones
1201060	1206620	What the fuck is up with this demented goddamn artwork on these ridiculous terrible articles?
1206920	1211160	You guys know you guys know that this is gonna have to be the thumbnail for this video, right?
1211320	1213320	And I just got to say before we get into it
1214080	1219200	Considering that these outlets like vice and vox and the end slate and the others that are all run by Millennials
1219200	1223880	I'm not surprised that they think they're actually hot shit today
1223880	1231000	Most Americans think about the toilet the same way they think about tissue paper or coat hangers. It's a fundamental satisfactory part of life
1231560	1233920	Sure going to the bathroom isn't exactly glamorous
1233920	1240760	But why should it be recently though a number of ambitious young people are trying to come up with newer cooler ways to poop
1240760	1242760	Stupid
1246720	1248720	It's so stupid like I
1249560	1251560	understand that there's a
1252040	1257400	Biological basis and squatting to shit instead of sitting it actually does help with bowel movements
1257400	1260120	And it's just based on our skeletal structure
1260120	1266720	I get that but why do you need a fucking social justice II propaganda article talking about how?
1266840	1272240	Millennials are saving the world by inventing new ways to take a shit who fucking cares
1273000	1274600	Okay, I need to be fucking done
1274600	1280440	This is this has been a ridiculous week, and I hate all the fucking articles that everyone's sending me fuck you guys
1280440	1286320	Oh, I will say though come back to this channel tonight because we're going to be doing the monthly community night
1286320	1289400	I don't think there's been any fan art to show off this month
1290200	1292440	And I think I got one package to open up
1292480	1297120	But we will be watching a movie together and those of you who are either twitch subscribers or
1297760	1302160	Patreon supporters can hop into a voice call with us and watch the movie with us
1302160	1307440	We will of course be streaming it to everyone who is not in the voice call in honor of it being American Thanksgiving
