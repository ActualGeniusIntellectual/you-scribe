00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
Welcome to SJ weekly for the 25th of November 2018

00:04.500 --> 00:09.360
Today, I'm drinking. It's called 8 o'clock coffee. Let's let's give it a try

00:13.120 --> 00:18.120
Hmm oh it's good coffee, but I didn't put enough milk in hold on a second

00:22.180 --> 00:24.760
Yes in Canada milk comes in bags

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Oh

00:40.960 --> 00:46.880
There we go perfect, I know my baby I like I like sugar and and milk in my coffee

00:46.880 --> 00:50.160
I know let's start with my friend low ping

00:50.840 --> 00:54.660
He's an Italian chef making kissy fingers apparently

00:55.180 --> 01:01.720
Let's see what you enjoy so much if a post starts with hey folks, you know, everything after it is going to suck hard shit

01:02.340 --> 01:06.780
Yeah, it is one of those things, you know, like yass Queen's sleigh or

01:07.500 --> 01:12.960
Maybe just maybe or let's unpack this a little bit. It's one of those things, right?

01:13.700 --> 01:15.220
Hey folks

01:15.220 --> 01:16.500
using mixed

01:16.500 --> 01:18.140
capitalized slash

01:18.140 --> 01:22.940
Capitalized letters to mock a point is super ableist and possibly classist

01:22.940 --> 01:28.800
If you can't ridicule bigotry without resorting to bigotry like that need to work on yourself a lot

01:29.100 --> 01:34.700
the problem with this type of reasoning aside from how ridiculously stupid it is is that

01:35.500 --> 01:40.620
Eventually, you're gonna get to the point where you're not going to be able to describe the difference between good and bad

01:40.800 --> 01:45.740
Because they will say that all the various descriptors of things that are good and things that are bad are

01:46.180 --> 01:51.640
Oppressive because these people fundamentally don't believe in in hierarchy and in value systems

01:51.780 --> 01:56.700
So if you don't have a hierarchy, you don't have a system of values. How can you judge? What is good?

01:56.700 --> 01:57.780
And what is bad?

01:57.780 --> 02:02.900
CNN's Don Lemon we have to stop humanizing people and realize that the biggest terror threat in this country is white men

02:03.140 --> 02:06.020
Most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them

02:06.060 --> 02:10.220
I'm gonna have a video probably one of those short bite-sized videos on this topic soon

02:10.340 --> 02:16.740
But let's let's watch this and just see how ridiculous it actually is we messaged about this a little bit this weekend

02:16.740 --> 02:21.500
I keep trying to point out to people not to demonize any one group or any one ethnicity

02:21.620 --> 02:27.100
But we keep thinking that the biggest terror threat is something else some some people who are marching

02:27.180 --> 02:33.980
You know towards the border like it's imminent and the last time they did this a couple hundred people came and they you know

02:34.740 --> 02:37.580
Most of them did get into the country most of them tired

02:37.580 --> 02:40.660
You know got tuckered out before they even made it to the border

02:42.060 --> 02:48.980
So we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is

02:49.700 --> 02:55.940
White men most of them radicalized right up to the right and we have to start doing something about them

02:55.940 --> 03:01.460
There is no travel ban on them. There is no ban on you know, they had the Muslim ban

03:01.460 --> 03:04.260
There is no white guy ban. So what do we do about that?

03:05.020 --> 03:09.620
Can you imagine going on CNN and saying the exact same thing about black men

03:10.700 --> 03:15.920
We have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is black men

03:16.100 --> 03:20.320
Most of them radicalized to the left and we have to start doing something about them

03:20.780 --> 03:25.340
Imagine saying that you would lose your job at CNN. You'd be escorted out of the building

03:25.340 --> 03:31.020
You'd probably be shot in an alleyway somewhere. I really do love Twitter. It's it's the best source of stuff like this

03:31.020 --> 03:33.020
Online

03:34.180 --> 03:39.160
Trolling comes entirely from Americans. I see no trolling coming from Europeans or people from anywhere else in the world

03:40.180 --> 03:43.220
someone needs to make a social study on why this is um

03:44.220 --> 03:48.060
I'm I'm Canadian and I troll quite a bit online

03:48.800 --> 03:52.280
No offense, but this anecdote is totally false obviously false

03:52.940 --> 03:57.020
No offense to you, but you don't know what Europeans are like online because you're American

03:57.020 --> 04:01.000
That's why so many people were triggered by this tweet. I'm English not American

04:01.020 --> 04:03.020
but

04:03.980 --> 04:07.580
Do you really think that Australians don't troll

04:08.300 --> 04:11.980
Do you really think that anybody else doesn't troll on the internet?

04:12.100 --> 04:13.580
Let's get down to business

04:13.580 --> 04:19.700
University staff told that capital letters could frighten anxious students lecturers also urged to avoid

04:19.980 --> 04:27.700
Negative language and using the word don't so you can't all caps anything now and you can't mix caps anything now

04:27.780 --> 04:33.980
And you also can't use the word don't why is it that university students have less of a spine than five-year-olds

04:34.300 --> 04:41.220
The memo warned that writing in uppercase letters a common method for drawing attention to key points could make the task seem

04:41.660 --> 04:44.220
Intimidating and frighten the students into failure

04:44.900 --> 04:51.020
Really, so you're going to fail because someone all caps a word or a sentence

04:51.100 --> 04:55.540
Maybe maybe that's why I like here check this out. Check this out. I'm gonna start all caps thing. All right

04:57.700 --> 05:03.500
There you go. I just all caps something and all I have to do is do this and then students will start to fail

05:03.500 --> 05:07.900
Their exams, that's it. That's all you got to do. I mean, it's got nothing to do with studying

05:08.060 --> 05:14.140
It's got nothing to do with attending your classes or or completing your assignments or any kind of preparation. No

05:14.140 --> 05:21.700
Yeah, you want your students to fail just all caps that shit staff are encouraged not to use the word don't where possible

05:21.860 --> 05:22.860
While

05:22.860 --> 05:25.740
Overusing the word do is also discouraged

05:25.780 --> 05:32.620
So you quite literally can't give any direction at all because if you can't tell someone to do something

05:32.620 --> 05:36.780
You can't tell someone to to don't do something. What does that leave?

05:37.100 --> 05:43.220
That's basically the entirety of human action an anonymous staff member told the Daily Express that the staff

05:43.340 --> 05:49.440
Bulked at being asked to treat intelligent students like children. We are not doing our students any favors or this kind of nonsense

05:49.440 --> 05:52.200
They told the newspaper. Absolutely. They're absolutely right

05:52.720 --> 06:00.000
However, the university's vice chancellor professor Margaret a house said that press coverage had been overblown and that the guidelines in the memo was drawn

06:00.000 --> 06:03.680
From national best practice teaching guidelines. Well, guess what?

06:04.400 --> 06:09.120
Those national best practice teaching guidelines. They're fucking wrong

06:09.440 --> 06:15.400
Let's talk about something else that is just blatantly false meet the woman bringing social justice to astrology

06:15.760 --> 06:21.040
Well astrology is already a nonsense field so if you want to add more nonsense into it

06:21.040 --> 06:23.040
I guess there's no harm, right?

06:23.280 --> 06:28.600
Chani Nicholas is transforming horoscopes from quips about finding true love and stumbling into financial good fortune

06:29.080 --> 06:32.280
To pointed calls to action. The future is female

06:32.720 --> 06:35.740
I'm sorry lady, but you're not gonna be the one who makes it to Mars

06:35.920 --> 06:41.120
She's transforming horoscopes into calls to action with a left-leaning social justice agenda

06:41.560 --> 06:48.280
Based in LA, of course, she's fucking based in LA. She weaves activism into the majority of her writing. I mean

06:49.400 --> 06:54.040
You could you could just write this stuff at this point man. All these people are like this

06:54.240 --> 06:59.200
I'm basically an angry feminist who just happens to be into astrology and healing. Yeah, no shit

06:59.200 --> 07:02.960
It's like those witches from a few weeks ago who are casting spells against Donald Trump

07:02.960 --> 07:08.840
Here's an example of one of her horoscopes when a society chooses protection for some while denying dignity for all

07:08.960 --> 07:10.960
We have forsaken the soul of the world

07:11.660 --> 07:19.020
Imagine breaking open a fortune cookie and instead of getting any kind of advice about your life you get this it's like well

07:19.980 --> 07:25.580
Fine, but what am I supposed to do about it? Like I can't do anything. I'm I'm just getting my Chinese food

07:25.580 --> 07:29.880
I'm not I'm not capable of changing shit like this following the 2016 presidential election

07:29.880 --> 07:34.820
These people wrote a piece suggesting that the outcome of the vote would be attributed to the fact that the month before

07:35.300 --> 07:41.160
Aggressive Mars and power monger Pluto were both in Capricorn the sign that rules the patriarchy

07:41.220 --> 07:46.500
This is all fucking stupidity. However, if the heavens themselves are against your ideology

07:47.340 --> 07:52.960
It's time to give up. Let's skip across the pond and see my friend Sargon of Akkad get

07:53.800 --> 07:57.620
Get dragged by the Kent anti-racism network

07:58.220 --> 08:03.100
Cancel the far-right Sargon of Akkad meeting at the University of Kent. Apparently it's still going on

08:03.140 --> 08:04.500
It's happening on on Wednesday

08:04.500 --> 08:11.540
I guess some people are going to be there protesting at Kent anti-racism network condemns the decision made by the University of Kent to invite

08:11.540 --> 08:15.840
Carl Benjamin also known as Sargon of Akkad to speak on campus later this month

08:16.360 --> 08:23.820
Carl is a well-known far-right youtuber who openly supports Tommy Robinson and produces vile YouTube videos full of offensive language and imagery

08:23.820 --> 08:27.160
Yeah, dude, those D&D streams. They're just fucking terrible

08:27.160 --> 08:34.440
You know, I do got to say though people seem to nowadays use far-right as a synonym for asshole

08:34.880 --> 08:36.880
It's just someone they don't like right

08:37.440 --> 08:41.560
There's nothing about Sargon's politics that are far-right. He seems to be center-left

08:41.560 --> 08:47.160
I'm a bit more left than he is, but he's still definitely within the realm of center-left

08:47.640 --> 08:52.860
However to people like this anybody who is not hard left is far-right

08:53.340 --> 08:59.540
Benjamin was banned from Twitter after instigating a misogynistic trolling campaign against MP Jess Phillips declaring

08:59.540 --> 09:00.820
I wouldn't even rape you

09:00.820 --> 09:06.740
I just have to ask would it have been more or less misogynistic if he said he would rape her

09:06.740 --> 09:12.380
Kent Union tried to stop the meeting from going ahead believing his presence on campus would invite racial hatred and violence

09:12.740 --> 09:17.620
However, the university's management have overruled student representatives and plan to allow the event to go ahead

09:17.620 --> 09:22.460
Well good on them because it's free speech. You can think that absolutely everything Sargon says is

09:23.100 --> 09:28.260
Ridiculous nonsense and if it is ridiculous nonsense, he will show it when he speaks

09:28.660 --> 09:31.260
So just let him speak if he's a fool

09:31.460 --> 09:35.940
You will be able to tell we stand with the students at UKC who are refusing to tolerate

09:36.180 --> 09:41.300
Fascism on campus or anywhere else in our communities and we will support them in preventing this meeting from going ahead

09:41.780 --> 09:44.900
It sounds like there's probably gonna be a protest

09:44.900 --> 09:49.620
Maybe a few more soy boys are gonna rush the stage and Sargon can take another flag. Let's see the comments here

09:49.620 --> 09:53.700
What's interesting to note is that only certain comments are showing up on this page

09:53.860 --> 09:59.540
Obviously the ones made by the pages owner are showing up. Certainly this person here if they don't say no then protest

10:00.260 --> 10:03.360
Fuck my life. Why first Milo now this so gross

10:03.900 --> 10:07.180
There are boundaries in society for a reason some things are just not okay

10:07.380 --> 10:10.540
Finally down at the bottom the first comment against this nonsense

10:10.820 --> 10:15.460
When your ideology is built like a house of cards and completely indefensible to any other ideology

10:15.460 --> 10:21.140
Then silencing is your only alternative the students will eventually find out why they have been lied to out in the real world

10:21.140 --> 10:24.260
In order to see the majority of replies that are critical to this

10:24.260 --> 10:30.020
You actually have to start opening up all these things and they only appear sometimes you get to really click to get to find them

10:30.020 --> 10:32.460
Why on earth are you opposed to hearing things? You don't agree with?

10:32.700 --> 10:37.980
How else would you acquire the relevant material with which to effectively argue against it if not by listening and analyzing it?

10:37.980 --> 10:41.380
I mean that's pretty much true, but you have to dig to find this comment

10:41.460 --> 10:45.580
But this week we have a second story relating to Britain and fatness

10:45.580 --> 10:50.700
I was kicked off the Harry Potter ride for being too fat for the seats, by the way

10:50.700 --> 10:54.980
Yes, that was a fat joke about Sargon. Please don't expel me from the mob my Don Jesus

10:55.420 --> 10:58.740
I've never seen the soy boy face in a woman before but here it is

10:58.740 --> 11:04.020
I refuse to take on the additional guilt of not having gotten into Harry Potter until I was 35

11:04.340 --> 11:10.240
But I'll admit that despite the annoying JK Rowling versus native people scandal that I doubt you heard anything about

11:10.440 --> 11:14.600
But I followed because I'm native. Are you fucking sure you're native? You look quite white

11:15.120 --> 11:19.160
This is this like the Elizabeth Warren one-drop rule straight up

11:19.160 --> 11:23.840
I am 1 16th native my grandfather's grandmother that basically means that I'm

11:24.440 --> 11:29.060
1516 white and therefore I am white and you look whiter than I do lady

11:29.120 --> 11:34.000
it was the depression and disgust surrounding Donald Trump's election that sent me into a

11:34.520 --> 11:40.040
An YA a year fantasy endurance run where I went so far as to purchase an armchair

11:40.320 --> 11:44.980
From my around-the-clock bedroom reading. I'm sure you had an armchair before Jesus Christ

11:45.000 --> 11:46.640
You seem like you sit in it a lot

11:46.640 --> 11:51.920
It should be no surprise that when three friends and I went to the Universal Studios just outside Los Angeles last month

11:51.920 --> 11:57.960
I demanded that our first experience be the Wizarding World of Harry Potter as it was my first time at Universal Studios

11:57.960 --> 12:02.880
I couldn't have possibly been more tickled to drink butter beer and visit all the Hogsmeade shops

12:02.920 --> 12:08.680
I even purchased a $50 wand that I used in all the goofy little spell slots around the delightful town square

12:08.680 --> 12:12.400
And you know what up until now this actually sounds like a bit of good wholesome fun

12:12.560 --> 12:19.800
My dear friend Ruha who had been a guest on my woman of size podcast, but the discrimination against fat women's bodies

12:20.200 --> 12:25.280
Wrote heads up. I was kicked off the Hogwarts ride because I didn't fit it was humiliating

12:25.280 --> 12:28.260
But they gave me front-of-the-line passes to the rest of the rides at Universal

12:29.100 --> 12:35.940
You do realize there's a safety consideration right if you're too heavy or you're too wide or you're too tall

12:36.220 --> 12:41.900
Or you can't fit in the seats somehow and and they can't securely strap you into the ride

12:42.660 --> 12:49.300
They can't let you go on. It's not about fat discrimination. It's about you not fucking dying on their watch

12:49.900 --> 12:54.180
Like the fat lady I am big and loud and demanding and I absolutely refuse to vanish

12:54.180 --> 12:56.180
How

12:56.620 --> 13:02.260
Unfortunate for the rest of us I did with any new Hogwarts student would do after being warned that she might be excluded

13:02.260 --> 13:07.500
I bounded into the line with my friends and we were soon dazzled by the intricate details of the Hogwarts School of Wizardry

13:08.060 --> 13:12.240
Disappearing projections of Harry Ron and Hermione the pensieve inside Dumbledore's chambers

13:12.240 --> 13:13.820
It was so exciting that I found myself

13:13.820 --> 13:18.280
Chuckling and prancing like a schoolgirl going to her first dance when we reached the front of the line

13:18.280 --> 13:21.300
We were perfectly placed in the ride four across and seats locked down

13:21.300 --> 13:26.620
I glanced at my friends and we all cackled we made it I got on I'm not too Oh

13:28.260 --> 13:32.740
One of the 20-something ride managers walked over and asked us all to step off because of a safety issue

13:32.980 --> 13:36.100
We were ushered through a door to it looked like a backstage area

13:36.500 --> 13:41.820
Where another 20-something employee rattle off a spiel about safety and three clicks and having to try out a safety seat

13:41.820 --> 13:45.120
That's when we all knew that I hadn't actually made it on to the Hogwarts ride

13:45.140 --> 13:49.340
You could always lose weight and come back to the park

13:49.340 --> 13:51.140
And in fact if that is your goal

13:51.140 --> 13:56.260
Maybe eating and drinking this stuff is not the way to go at the Universal Studios in Orlando

13:56.260 --> 14:01.980
Florida the locking mechanisms on the Hogwarts ride were adjusted in 2010 to safely accommodate bigger bodies

14:02.180 --> 14:07.480
But not before this man was inspired to lose weight so he could be allowed on board. That's wrong

14:08.260 --> 14:12.460
Exclusion and shame are not motivational techniques their forms of bullying

14:13.060 --> 14:15.820
Exclusion makes me a logical and educated person

14:16.460 --> 14:19.380
Believe that I'm at fault for not fitting into this ride

14:19.780 --> 14:25.700
Instead of recognizing that rides should accommodate all people's bodies shame is a good motivational technique

14:25.700 --> 14:28.620
Although it is it is quite negative and sometimes it's inappropriate

14:29.860 --> 14:34.760
Exclusion though can actually be quite positive because the point of exclusion is not to say

14:34.940 --> 14:38.700
You can never get in the point of exclusion is to say

14:39.180 --> 14:42.360
You currently don't have what it takes to get in

14:42.400 --> 14:45.480
It's actually quite important to our society that people are are

14:45.920 --> 14:51.920
Ranked on ability and if that means that exclusion is a force at play then that is how it has to be

14:52.040 --> 14:54.960
We are better off. It's not a form of bullying

14:54.960 --> 14:59.480
It's a form of filtering and I know that I'm getting a bit serious here because we're not talking about

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
important positions that need to be filled

15:02.360 --> 15:04.080
We're just talking about a ride

15:04.080 --> 15:11.600
But the same idea applies from Gawker horse genitals taste of hay and more curious delights from a horse fucker

15:13.360 --> 15:20.240
Kelly Conaboy filed to horse fuckers. I'm not gonna fucking read this one. Fuck you

15:20.880 --> 15:22.960
Jesus the first transgender man

15:24.720 --> 15:26.720
Somehow this is a better alternative

15:26.920 --> 15:30.920
The church teaches that Jesus is the new Adam born of the new Eve

15:31.400 --> 15:37.840
Eve is a fascinating creature for many reasons. The Bible tells us she is the first example of human cloning

15:37.880 --> 15:41.620
I can kind of see that being the case if she's just taken from the rib of Adam

15:41.800 --> 15:48.440
That's kind of clone like isn't it fun doesn't stop there if we take the Genesis account in its literal meaning as conservative Christians demand

15:48.440 --> 15:51.160
That we do she is also the first case of a transgender woman

15:51.240 --> 15:58.480
God reached into Adam pulled out a bit of rib bone and grew Eve from that XY DNA into Adams companion

15:58.680 --> 16:03.360
She was created genetically male and yet transformed into a woman

16:07.840 --> 16:14.680
You want me to open and we to open the real lemon juice you can't open the cap. Are you serious?

16:17.120 --> 16:19.600
That was the easiest thing to open why did you

16:21.280 --> 16:28.400
Then along comes Jesus and the whole pattern is both repeated and reversed the first couple's refusal to cooperate is turned around by

16:28.400 --> 16:29.120
Mary's yes

16:29.120 --> 16:35.200
And the second act of cloning occurs the Holy Spirit comes upon the second Eve and the child takes flesh from her and is born

16:35.400 --> 16:41.520
Born of her flesh born with XX chromosome pairing born genetically female and yet

16:42.080 --> 16:45.720
transformed into man, so this hot take is basically that

16:46.640 --> 16:48.200
whenever God

16:48.200 --> 16:54.760
Spontaneously creates creatures if he doesn't using pieces of other creatures that DNA is transferred over

16:54.760 --> 16:56.560
I mean, I guess it makes sense

16:56.560 --> 17:02.640
But this is a stupid fucking conversation to be having isn't it and speaking of reproducing with only one set of DNA

17:03.480 --> 17:10.880
Remember last week there was that woman who married herself. Yeah. Well, uh woman who married herself cheats on herself

17:14.940 --> 17:17.480
To many adultery is no laughing matter

17:17.760 --> 17:22.720
But a British woman who married herself two years ago has prompted much mockery and mirth

17:22.960 --> 17:27.400
From viewers of this morning by announcing that she had been unfaithful to herself

17:28.160 --> 17:30.160
You couldn't even keep it in your pants

17:30.680 --> 17:31.680
a

17:31.680 --> 17:39.280
Sophie Tanner revealed to the host that she had cheated on herself with Ruari Barrett a polyamorous who is now also married to himself

17:42.160 --> 17:44.160
You guys could have married each other

17:46.200 --> 17:48.920
The practice of marrying oneself known as

17:49.280 --> 17:56.120
Solagamy is grown is growing in popularity in the UK with many women choosing to have a full ceremony to commemorate the event

17:56.560 --> 17:59.580
Tanner's father was even present to give away Sophie as a bride

18:00.800 --> 18:03.860
Self-marriages are not legally recognized by any official bodies

18:04.040 --> 18:07.840
But proponents say it amounts to more than the height of generation selfies

18:08.120 --> 18:13.440
Narcissism if you can't even maintain the marriage covenant with one person involved

18:13.440 --> 18:16.040
How do you think you'd actually be able to handle it with two?

18:16.560 --> 18:18.560
This week is so fucking stupid

18:19.080 --> 18:25.280
It was recently Thanksgiving in the United States. And apparently the story of Thanksgiving is the story of a migrant caravan

18:25.400 --> 18:33.200
Oh great. The caravan is here. That's actually kind of funny consider a classic text of our literature the memoir of plymouth plantation

18:33.200 --> 18:37.620
written by William Bradford the first governor of the plymouth colony in Massachusetts

18:38.020 --> 18:40.020
Bradford recalls how he and his fellow pilgrims

18:40.720 --> 18:47.740
Refugees who had undertaken a perilous journey to flee religious and political oppression in Europe arrived on the Mayflower ship in 1620

18:48.200 --> 18:51.040
Let's call this a kind of migrant caravan

18:51.040 --> 18:52.480
It's

18:52.480 --> 18:58.880
Not quite the same thing. I can see why you're drawing parallels, but there are also a few significant differences, aren't there?

18:58.960 --> 19:02.000
Let's take a look at the one country in South America

19:02.000 --> 19:08.160
That is not sending migrant caravans, but frankly if they were the United States should probably accept them

19:08.800 --> 19:13.200
progressives should admit socialism failed even the Venezuelan president did

19:13.840 --> 19:18.660
Surprisingly Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro admitted that socialism has ruined his country

19:19.180 --> 19:26.600
Well, you're a fucking idiot then aren't you mr. Empanada here got rich and fat while destroying his country this week Maduro

19:26.600 --> 19:31.160
Blamed the Socialist United Party for the failed state of the nation. The economy is a complete wreck

19:31.860 --> 19:36.340
Socialism wrecks countries bring disaster and misery to the citizens and it's true

19:37.060 --> 19:41.460
Venezuela is a pretty good example of socialism in action and any kind of

19:41.860 --> 19:47.720
University student social justice soy boy that tells you that Venezuelan socialism isn't real socialism

19:47.800 --> 19:53.160
They are simply little Maduro's in waiting and speaking of just shit

19:54.120 --> 19:56.640
Millennials are making pooping cool again

19:57.240 --> 20:00.560
Our bodies weren't meant to poop on porcelain thrones

20:01.060 --> 20:06.620
What the fuck is up with this demented goddamn artwork on these ridiculous terrible articles?

20:06.920 --> 20:11.160
You guys know you guys know that this is gonna have to be the thumbnail for this video, right?

20:11.320 --> 20:13.320
And I just got to say before we get into it

20:14.080 --> 20:19.200
Considering that these outlets like vice and vox and the end slate and the others that are all run by Millennials

20:19.200 --> 20:23.880
I'm not surprised that they think they're actually hot shit today

20:23.880 --> 20:31.000
Most Americans think about the toilet the same way they think about tissue paper or coat hangers. It's a fundamental satisfactory part of life

20:31.560 --> 20:33.920
Sure going to the bathroom isn't exactly glamorous

20:33.920 --> 20:40.760
But why should it be recently though a number of ambitious young people are trying to come up with newer cooler ways to poop

20:40.760 --> 20:42.760
Stupid

20:46.720 --> 20:48.720
It's so stupid like I

20:49.560 --> 20:51.560
understand that there's a

20:52.040 --> 20:57.400
Biological basis and squatting to shit instead of sitting it actually does help with bowel movements

20:57.400 --> 21:00.120
And it's just based on our skeletal structure

21:00.120 --> 21:06.720
I get that but why do you need a fucking social justice II propaganda article talking about how?

21:06.840 --> 21:12.240
Millennials are saving the world by inventing new ways to take a shit who fucking cares

21:13.000 --> 21:14.600
Okay, I need to be fucking done

21:14.600 --> 21:20.440
This is this has been a ridiculous week, and I hate all the fucking articles that everyone's sending me fuck you guys

21:20.440 --> 21:26.320
Oh, I will say though come back to this channel tonight because we're going to be doing the monthly community night

21:26.320 --> 21:29.400
I don't think there's been any fan art to show off this month

21:30.200 --> 21:32.440
And I think I got one package to open up

21:32.480 --> 21:37.120
But we will be watching a movie together and those of you who are either twitch subscribers or

21:37.760 --> 21:42.160
Patreon supporters can hop into a voice call with us and watch the movie with us

21:42.160 --> 21:47.440
We will of course be streaming it to everyone who is not in the voice call in honor of it being American Thanksgiving

21:47.840 --> 21:50.200
Recently this month's movie will be

21:50.880 --> 21:52.880
poultry geist

21:53.160 --> 21:59.160
So make sure to come back tonight. I'll see you at probably probably between 7 and 8 p.m.. EST

21:59.360 --> 22:01.660
I'll see you then guys. I love you
