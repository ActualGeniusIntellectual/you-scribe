1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,240
Another thing I missed while I was off falling apart was the whole Martha's Vineyard migrant

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,240
thing.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,240
Here's the TLDR.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,720
In September of 2022, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis flew 50 immigrants, mostly refugees

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,520
from Venezuela, to Martha's Vineyard.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,220
Martha's Vineyard, an island off the coast of Massachusetts, is one of the wealthiest

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,880
locations in the entire United States, a reasonably isolated spot where movie stars, politicians,

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,400
and billionaires keep vacation homes that sit empty for most of the year.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,600
It's a scenic, beautiful location with lots of old buildings and history.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,200
It's also one of the most deeply blue voting locations in the entire country, on par with

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,200
places like New York and California.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,440
DeSantis' decision to transport the 50 immigrants to Martha's Vineyard is best understood

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,880
in the context of a wider program by Texas Governor Greg Abbott doing something very

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,040
similar, busing people arriving in his state from other countries to places like LA, New

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,880
York City, and Washington DC.

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,000
The Texas state government has transported over 10,000 immigrants out of the red state

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
to these predominantly blue areas since the beginning of 2022.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,840
A lot of people on the broader left are complaining about the state of affairs.

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,780
Your rank and file internet leftoids are screeching at everyone on the right, calling them racist

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,000
and fascist for this, but they do that for everything.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,040
Establishment Democrat politicians are claiming that DeSantis and Abbott are engaging in human

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,440
trafficking by moving the migrants from red states to blue states.

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,160
Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns went on CNN to compare the move to the Holocaust, since

24
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,720
his upcoming documentary is partially about the Holocaust, saying it's the abstraction

25
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,720
of human life.

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,760
This is coming straight out of the authoritarian playbook.

27
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,280
This is what's so disturbing about DeSantis, to use human beings, to weaponize human beings

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,480
for political purpose.

29
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,840
And the incredibly rich people of Martha's Vineyard were very quick to say that they

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,560
just can't help the migrants.

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
There's no room here.

32
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,720
We have, at some point in time, they have to move from here to somewhere else, right?

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:51,880
We cannot, we don't have the services to take care of 50 immigrants, and we certainly don't

34
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
have housing.

35
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,560
We're in a housing crisis as we are on this island, and so we don't, we can't house everyone

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,880
here that lives here and works here.

37
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,760
We don't have housing for 50 more people.

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,960
A quick peek on local Martha's Vineyard Facebook groups will show these people ripping each

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,440
other apart for not wanting to give up their vacant rental properties and summer homes

40
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,340
for the migrants to live in, which is just hilarious to watch.

41
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,300
After all, diversity is our strength, isn't it?

42
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,680
Why not make Martha's Vineyard more diverse?

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,760
Places like Martha's Vineyard voted for and support things like illegal immigration, open

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,360
borders policies, and sanctuary states and cities.

45
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,620
Why should their communities not be the sanctuary?

46
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,880
Why should they not be the ones to support the consequences of their votes?

47
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,460
The red states overwhelmingly voted against these policies, so it makes sense that they

48
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,880
transfer these people to the states that actually want them.

49
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,880
What's the issue here?

50
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,640
Well, seeing as I'm a few weeks late on the story, some further info has come out that

51
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,020
I assume right-leaning YouTubers and pundits probably haven't talked about, either because

52
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,160
it goes against their biases or because the news cycle has moved on.

53
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,760
One good thing about being slow is I can actually get the whole picture.

54
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,760
Firstly, while it's really funny to watch the hyper-rich of Martha's Vineyard rip

55
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,160
each other apart because they can't just virtue signal anymore they're actually being

56
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,360
called to do something in reality, some of them actually did step up.

57
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,800
A lot of them failed to put their money where their mouth is and revealed themselves to

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,760
be the racists we always knew them to be, which is why the memes that came out of this

59
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,840
were so hilarious.

60
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,840
But some of them actually did it.

61
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,080
When the 50 migrants arrived at Martha's Vineyard, part of the community actually turned

62
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,120
a local community center into a shelter, providing beds and food.

63
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,280
They may not have the infrastructure to let them live on the island in perpetuity, and

64
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,080
their reaction was pretty funny when they finally left, but it's not like they were

65
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,600
instantly abandoned the second they stepped off the plane.

66
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,320
Secondly, it turns out that, at least in the case of the specific 50 migrants that DeSantis

67
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,360
sent to Migrant's Vineyard, they were lied to.

68
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,560
They were enticed to get on the plane by Florida officials, telling them they were actually

69
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,520
headed to Boston to get work papers.

70
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,160
Judd Legum, a freelance journalist, got a hold of the brochures that were handed out

71
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,880
by the officials to the 50 migrants.

72
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,640
The brochures claimed to be on behalf of the state of Massachusetts, and they offer benefits

73
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,080
like eight months of cash payments, food, job training, and housing to new refugees.

74
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,640
The programs listed on the brochure are real in Massachusetts, but the pamphlet wasn't

75
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,200
made by anybody from that state.

76
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,760
It was made by the state of Florida.

77
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
To me, this is scummy.

78
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,580
Okay, your state doesn't want to deal with the effects of an open borders policy you

79
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,580
didn't vote for.

80
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,580
I understand that part.

81
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,320
You want to send the migrants to the locations who voted for them.

82
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
Got it.

83
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,480
You entice people with the benefits of those other locations.

84
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,480
Even that's okay.

85
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,840
But to tell them, hey, you're going to Boston to get all this shit in the brochure, and

86
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,320
instead send them to Martha's Vineyard for a political stunt?

87
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,480
That's actually pretty shitty.

88
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,000
And DeSantis knew that he had to basically pull the old switcheroo on this one, which

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,320
is why he deliberately lied about migrants on other planes leaving Florida to the press.

90
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,040
Though it is reasonable to send migrants from states who don't want them and didn't vote

91
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,160
for them to states that do and did, that's not quite what DeSantis is doing here.

92
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,580
He's trying to keep his stunt in the news cycle for one more round in order to raise

93
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,580
his own profile.

94
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,420
It's not about sending migrants to sanctuary cities or states.

95
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,680
If so, they would have been sent to Boston as promised.

96
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,640
Instead, it's about sticking it to the democratic wealthy elite, which is fine, but it's using

97
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,200
migrants as a pawn to do it while lying to them, which isn't fine.

98
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,640
Even if it turns out that these people are 100% illegal immigrants, there's no legitimate

99
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,200
reason for asylum status or anything like that, then what you should do is deport them,

100
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,880
not ship them around the country, to raise your electability with your base.

101
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,160
They're still people, they've still got rights, they may not have the right to stay

102
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,600
in your country, but that doesn't mean that you can do with them what you will.

103
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,040
All that being said, it's not like Republicans are uniquely guilty for shipping around new

104
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,280
arrivals for political gain.

105
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,760
Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot did the same thing a week before this story broke.

106
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,200
Abbott sent 150 migrants to Chicago, since Chicago is a sanctuary city, and Lightfoot,

107
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,600
a Democrat, packed them up and sent them to the nearby Republican voting town of Burr

108
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,640
Ridge, specifically to a hotel that one year ago partnered with churches and charitable

109
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,440
organizations to temporarily house Afghani refugees after the fall of the Afghan government.

110
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,960
But that was a one-time deal specific to that event, which you could argue that the Americans

111
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,760
had a moral obligation to help out with, considering that they caused the Afghanistan situation

112
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,760
in the first place.

113
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,720
But ultimately, it's a hotel, not a refugee facility.

114
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,040
All of this is justified by what the Republicans have come to call the Biden administration's

115
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
ghost flights.

116
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,760
The term ghost flight refers to what Republicans call secret flights that carry migrants from

117
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,760
the border to communities across the country.

118
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,960
Up until the start of 2022, ghost flight actually referred to planes that flew around with little

119
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,760
or no passengers to preserve an airline's runway spot at a destination airport, where

120
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,240
it would have cost them more to not fly the plane and lose the spot to their competition

121
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,840
than it would to just fly an empty plane.

122
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,000
But in this context, it refers to something different, referring to the Biden administration

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,640
secretly packing migrants onto planes at the border under the cover of darkness and

124
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,480
shipping them off to the American interior.

125
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,120
At least one video secretly shot by former House Rep Lou Barletta at an airport in Pennsylvania

126
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,320
seemed to show the nighttime journey of a bunch of newly arrived migrants.

127
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,180
But the Republican interpretation of these events seems to be wrong.

128
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,440
The flights aren't secret.

129
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,200
The law authorizing them was first signed in 2000 by Bill Clinton as the Victims of

130
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,740
Trafficking and Violence Protection Act and was renewed in 2003, 2006, and 2008 by George

131
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,740
Bush.

132
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,300
It was launched in 2011, but Obama brought it back in 2013 as an amendment to the Violence

133
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,700
Against Women Act, which passed.

134
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,200
The amendment lapsed in 2017 and Trump reauthorized it, this time as its own bill again, the Trafficking

135
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,140
Victims Protection Act of 2017.

136
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,100
By the way, that Violence Against Women Act, which the Trafficking Victims Protection Act

137
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,900
was temporarily stapled onto by Obama in 2013, it lapsed as a result of the 2018 government

138
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,700
shutdown, but had an attempted revival in April of 2019.

139
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,400
However, it was Senate Democrats desperate to not give Trump any sort of a win who refused

140
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,360
to get on board with reauthorizing it.

141
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,880
Biden eventually signed it back into law in March of 2022.

142
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,800
I don't know if Biden's 2022 reauthorizing also revived the stapled version of the Trafficking

143
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,760
Act, considering that it became its own thing again back in 2018, but if it did, it was

144
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,460
likely up for renewal anyway.

145
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,680
The point is, though, the federal government hasn't been secretly flying migrants around

146
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,280
the country to settle all over the place.

147
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,720
It's been openly doing it and has been on and off for over 20 years.

148
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,400
You can argue that practice should be stopped, but to imply it's being done in secret away

149
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,400
from any sort of oversight and hidden from the people just isn't true.

150
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,180
That kind of rhetoric only serves to prop up the narrative that it's the Republican

151
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,600
heroes who have uncovered the truth they're trying to hide, when in actuality it's not

152
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,000
a secret, it's normal.

153
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,880
You can argue it shouldn't be normal, and maybe it shouldn't be, but you haven't

154
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,960
discovered a conspiracy here, guys.

155
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,440
The actual conversation, though, is that the Biden administration and Trump and Obama and

156
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,780
Bush and Clinton, under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, have done for years what Abbott

157
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,240
and DeSantis are doing now.

158
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,020
Setting aside DeSantis lying to the migrants to get them on board the Martha's Vineyard

159
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,720
plane, and that's a pretty big thing to set aside, but let's roll with it.

160
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,640
Setting that aside, what is the difference?

161
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,000
Nobody seems to have a coherent answer to that question, but the Washington Post did

162
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,160
attempt to give one.

163
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,440
The difference between DeSantis' migrant flights and the Biden administration's.

164
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,660
Just as criticisms of the Biden administration's supposed ghost flights have long been overblown,

165
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,760
the comparison between the two situations mismatches in some key ways.

166
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,380
The whataboutism drumbeat has picked up in recent days.

167
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,760
You know, just saying, that's whataboutism isn't actually a reply.

168
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,840
When you bring up whataboutism, you're noticing that the topic has suddenly shifted from DeSantis'

169
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,520
migrant flights to Biden's, which doesn't excuse DeSantis, true, but it also doesn't

170
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
excuse Biden.

171
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,800
Talking about A right now, not B, is a true statement, but it serves to excuse neither

172
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,840
A nor B. The criticisms often skirt over the fact that these flights carry children, and

173
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
that's important.

174
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,160
In fact, the government, by law, cannot hold unaccompanied minors in border facilities

175
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,040
for more than 72 hours, and they must be cared for while they are transported to relatives,

176
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,200
sponsors, or shelters.

177
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
Fair enough.

178
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,800
We should probably ask why there are so many unaccompanied minors coming across the American

179
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
border.

180
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,120
Maybe there's something wrong with how the border is currently being handled, but asking

181
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,360
questions in 2022 is racist.

182
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,640
Another key distinction, it is indeed the federal government that is charged with enforcing

183
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
immigration law.

184
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,800
Also true, but as far as I know, DeSantis and Abbott aren't enforcing immigration

185
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
law.

186
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,200
They aren't deciding who stays or goes, they're sending people who stay to sanctuary

187
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,240
cities and states.

188
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,480
The buses and planes used by Republican governors, by contrast, convey people of all ages, and

189
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,620
they are asylum seekers.

190
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,860
The program is set up for people who have been processed by federal immigration officials

191
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,320
and are awaiting their dates in court.

192
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,660
DeSantis and Abbott have said that these migrants signed waivers, meaning their transportation

193
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,160
was elective rather than required by law, and if that's all it turns out to be, there's

194
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,520
likely to be no legal trouble.

195
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,520
Some migrants have said they were grateful to be transported to more welcoming places,

196
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,940
but Democrats, immigrant advocates, and some of the migrants themselves have suggested

197
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,200
the migrants might have been misled into participating.

198
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,240
That's the stated reason most are objecting to the practice.

199
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,840
And here we go, the only real criticism that doesn't just fall back on, well this is

200
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,280
just how the system is.

201
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,680
Abbott and DeSantis claim that the migrants have consented to being moved around.

202
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
And that's pretty believable.

203
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,760
If you tell a migrant, listen, Texas and Florida won't help you, but California and

204
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,320
New York will, do you want to go there?

205
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,600
They're probably going to say yes.

206
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,200
The article even says if that's the case, there's actually no reasonable objection

207
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
to the practice.

208
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,060
The issue is, some people claim it's happened without their consent, and you can make a

209
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,040
pretty strong argument that for the Martha's Vineyard stunt, the act of deliberately lying

210
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,060
about where the plane was going constitutes a lack of consent.

211
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,100
At that point, it probably does become a form of human trafficking.

212
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,800
The Martha's Vineyard migrants came from Texas originally, I think it was the feds

213
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,700
that shipped them to Florida, then it was Florida that shipped them to Martha's Vineyard

214
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,280
while telling them they were going to Boston.

215
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,320
The sheriff of their point of origin, from Bexar County, Texas, submitted certification

216
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,040
to have the migrants apply for U visas, which are a special type of visa for the victims

217
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,680
of a crime, to remain in the United States to ensure that when the time comes, they are

218
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,600
available to police or the court system as witnesses.

219
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,840
The sheriff has said, based on the claims of migrants being transported from Bexar County

220
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,360
under false pretenses, we are investigating this case as possible unlawful restraint.

221
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,080
There's two levels of malicious intent here.

222
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,940
The first one is how the Democratic establishment views migrants in the first place.

223
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,200
They want the country to take them in, and if you disagree with them, you're a racist.

224
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,620
But they don't want to be the ones who actually have to care for them.

225
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,900
They want you to do that.

226
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,840
They want to appear virtuous by opening the borders and saying everyone's welcome.

227
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,240
But when it comes to footing that bill, they're not going to do it themselves.

228
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
They're going to point at middle America.

229
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,180
Migrants are welcome, just not in the rich, affluent Democratic neighborhoods where senators

230
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,320
and philanthropists live.

231
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,560
You're going to be the one who houses and clothes these people, because it makes them

232
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,160
feel like they're doing the right thing.

233
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,320
This attitude is best spelled out by the Delusional Reason article advocating that Republicans

234
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,480
should take in immigrants to stick it to Biden's broken border policies.

235
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,780
Like fucking what?

236
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,980
The second level, though, is that among the completely reasonable responses from the right,

237
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:30,060
which basically amount to no, fuck you, take responsibility for your own decisions, Democrats,

238
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,000
where Abbott and DeSantis have been moving migrants to neighborhoods who actually voted

239
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
for them.

240
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,640
During that reasonable response, it seems like DeSantis may have actually fucked up.

241
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,640
It's actually quite bad if the Martha's Vineyard migrants were sent there under false

242
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
pretenses.

243
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,360
That likely is some kind of trafficking or kidnapping or unlawful restraint or whatever

244
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,540
the fuck, and the shadow of that terrible move is going to loom over the whole project.

245
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,020
The conversation has shifted away from Texas didn't vote for these migrants, so we're

246
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,260
sending them to New York who did vote for them, which is entirely reasonable, to DeSantis

247
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,580
kidnapped migrants and shipped them away for a political stunt, which is entirely awful.

248
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,300
If you're saying in your head right now, Dev, why are you focusing on this one tiny

249
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,380
bad action by DeSantis when it's the Democrats that are the problem?

250
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,020
They shouldn't be doing any of this.

251
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,140
Everything they've been doing is wrong.

252
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,640
You haven't been listening to me.

253
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,740
If you're going up against the establishment, you have to be squeaky clean.

254
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,100
I've said in multiple videos now, if you are better than them, you have to behave better

255
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,100
than them.

256
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,300
That's the reason these migrant transports have been happening since January without

257
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,940
a peep from anyone, but only turned into a viral story in September.

258
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,580
It's because the Republicans were actually doing everything properly and above board,

259
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,460
and there was no reasonable objection against it until DeSantis fucked up.
