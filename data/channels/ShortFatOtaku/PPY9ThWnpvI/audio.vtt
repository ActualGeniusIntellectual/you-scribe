00:00.000 --> 00:09.240
Another thing I missed while I was off falling apart was the whole Martha's Vineyard migrant

00:09.240 --> 00:10.240
thing.

00:10.240 --> 00:11.240
Here's the TLDR.

00:11.240 --> 00:15.720
In September of 2022, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis flew 50 immigrants, mostly refugees

00:15.720 --> 00:17.520
from Venezuela, to Martha's Vineyard.

00:17.520 --> 00:21.220
Martha's Vineyard, an island off the coast of Massachusetts, is one of the wealthiest

00:21.220 --> 00:26.880
locations in the entire United States, a reasonably isolated spot where movie stars, politicians,

00:26.880 --> 00:30.400
and billionaires keep vacation homes that sit empty for most of the year.

00:30.400 --> 00:33.600
It's a scenic, beautiful location with lots of old buildings and history.

00:33.600 --> 00:38.200
It's also one of the most deeply blue voting locations in the entire country, on par with

00:38.200 --> 00:40.200
places like New York and California.

00:40.200 --> 00:44.440
DeSantis' decision to transport the 50 immigrants to Martha's Vineyard is best understood

00:44.440 --> 00:48.880
in the context of a wider program by Texas Governor Greg Abbott doing something very

00:48.880 --> 00:53.040
similar, busing people arriving in his state from other countries to places like LA, New

00:53.040 --> 00:54.880
York City, and Washington DC.

00:54.880 --> 00:59.000
The Texas state government has transported over 10,000 immigrants out of the red state

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
to these predominantly blue areas since the beginning of 2022.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.840
A lot of people on the broader left are complaining about the state of affairs.

01:05.840 --> 01:09.780
Your rank and file internet leftoids are screeching at everyone on the right, calling them racist

01:09.780 --> 01:12.000
and fascist for this, but they do that for everything.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.040
Establishment Democrat politicians are claiming that DeSantis and Abbott are engaging in human

01:15.040 --> 01:18.440
trafficking by moving the migrants from red states to blue states.

01:18.440 --> 01:22.160
Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns went on CNN to compare the move to the Holocaust, since

01:22.160 --> 01:25.720
his upcoming documentary is partially about the Holocaust, saying it's the abstraction

01:25.720 --> 01:26.720
of human life.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.760
This is coming straight out of the authoritarian playbook.

01:28.760 --> 01:32.280
This is what's so disturbing about DeSantis, to use human beings, to weaponize human beings

01:32.280 --> 01:33.480
for political purpose.

01:33.480 --> 01:36.840
And the incredibly rich people of Martha's Vineyard were very quick to say that they

01:36.840 --> 01:38.560
just can't help the migrants.

01:38.560 --> 01:39.560
There's no room here.

01:39.560 --> 01:44.720
We have, at some point in time, they have to move from here to somewhere else, right?

01:44.720 --> 01:51.880
We cannot, we don't have the services to take care of 50 immigrants, and we certainly don't

01:51.880 --> 01:52.880
have housing.

01:52.880 --> 01:58.560
We're in a housing crisis as we are on this island, and so we don't, we can't house everyone

01:58.560 --> 02:00.880
here that lives here and works here.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.760
We don't have housing for 50 more people.

02:02.760 --> 02:06.960
A quick peek on local Martha's Vineyard Facebook groups will show these people ripping each

02:06.960 --> 02:10.440
other apart for not wanting to give up their vacant rental properties and summer homes

02:10.440 --> 02:13.340
for the migrants to live in, which is just hilarious to watch.

02:13.340 --> 02:15.300
After all, diversity is our strength, isn't it?

02:15.300 --> 02:17.680
Why not make Martha's Vineyard more diverse?

02:17.680 --> 02:21.760
Places like Martha's Vineyard voted for and support things like illegal immigration, open

02:21.800 --> 02:24.360
borders policies, and sanctuary states and cities.

02:24.360 --> 02:26.620
Why should their communities not be the sanctuary?

02:26.620 --> 02:29.880
Why should they not be the ones to support the consequences of their votes?

02:29.880 --> 02:33.460
The red states overwhelmingly voted against these policies, so it makes sense that they

02:33.460 --> 02:35.880
transfer these people to the states that actually want them.

02:35.880 --> 02:36.880
What's the issue here?

02:36.880 --> 02:40.640
Well, seeing as I'm a few weeks late on the story, some further info has come out that

02:40.640 --> 02:44.020
I assume right-leaning YouTubers and pundits probably haven't talked about, either because

02:44.020 --> 02:47.160
it goes against their biases or because the news cycle has moved on.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.760
One good thing about being slow is I can actually get the whole picture.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.760
Firstly, while it's really funny to watch the hyper-rich of Martha's Vineyard rip

02:52.760 --> 02:56.160
each other apart because they can't just virtue signal anymore they're actually being

02:56.160 --> 02:59.360
called to do something in reality, some of them actually did step up.

02:59.360 --> 03:02.800
A lot of them failed to put their money where their mouth is and revealed themselves to

03:02.800 --> 03:05.760
be the racists we always knew them to be, which is why the memes that came out of this

03:05.760 --> 03:06.840
were so hilarious.

03:06.840 --> 03:07.840
But some of them actually did it.

03:07.840 --> 03:11.080
When the 50 migrants arrived at Martha's Vineyard, part of the community actually turned

03:11.080 --> 03:14.120
a local community center into a shelter, providing beds and food.

03:14.120 --> 03:17.280
They may not have the infrastructure to let them live on the island in perpetuity, and

03:17.280 --> 03:20.080
their reaction was pretty funny when they finally left, but it's not like they were

03:20.080 --> 03:22.600
instantly abandoned the second they stepped off the plane.

03:22.600 --> 03:27.320
Secondly, it turns out that, at least in the case of the specific 50 migrants that DeSantis

03:27.320 --> 03:29.360
sent to Migrant's Vineyard, they were lied to.

03:29.360 --> 03:32.560
They were enticed to get on the plane by Florida officials, telling them they were actually

03:32.560 --> 03:34.520
headed to Boston to get work papers.

03:34.520 --> 03:38.160
Judd Legum, a freelance journalist, got a hold of the brochures that were handed out

03:38.160 --> 03:39.880
by the officials to the 50 migrants.

03:39.880 --> 03:43.640
The brochures claimed to be on behalf of the state of Massachusetts, and they offer benefits

03:43.640 --> 03:48.080
like eight months of cash payments, food, job training, and housing to new refugees.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.640
The programs listed on the brochure are real in Massachusetts, but the pamphlet wasn't

03:51.640 --> 03:53.200
made by anybody from that state.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.760
It was made by the state of Florida.

03:54.760 --> 03:55.760
To me, this is scummy.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.580
Okay, your state doesn't want to deal with the effects of an open borders policy you

03:58.580 --> 03:59.580
didn't vote for.

03:59.580 --> 04:00.580
I understand that part.

04:00.580 --> 04:02.320
You want to send the migrants to the locations who voted for them.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.320
Got it.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.480
You entice people with the benefits of those other locations.

04:05.480 --> 04:06.480
Even that's okay.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.840
But to tell them, hey, you're going to Boston to get all this shit in the brochure, and

04:09.840 --> 04:12.320
instead send them to Martha's Vineyard for a political stunt?

04:12.320 --> 04:13.480
That's actually pretty shitty.

04:13.480 --> 04:17.000
And DeSantis knew that he had to basically pull the old switcheroo on this one, which

04:17.000 --> 04:21.320
is why he deliberately lied about migrants on other planes leaving Florida to the press.

04:21.320 --> 04:25.040
Though it is reasonable to send migrants from states who don't want them and didn't vote

04:25.040 --> 04:29.160
for them to states that do and did, that's not quite what DeSantis is doing here.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.580
He's trying to keep his stunt in the news cycle for one more round in order to raise

04:32.580 --> 04:33.580
his own profile.

04:33.580 --> 04:36.420
It's not about sending migrants to sanctuary cities or states.

04:36.420 --> 04:38.680
If so, they would have been sent to Boston as promised.

04:38.680 --> 04:42.640
Instead, it's about sticking it to the democratic wealthy elite, which is fine, but it's using

04:42.640 --> 04:46.200
migrants as a pawn to do it while lying to them, which isn't fine.

04:46.200 --> 04:49.640
Even if it turns out that these people are 100% illegal immigrants, there's no legitimate

04:49.640 --> 04:53.200
reason for asylum status or anything like that, then what you should do is deport them,

04:53.200 --> 04:55.880
not ship them around the country, to raise your electability with your base.

04:55.880 --> 04:59.160
They're still people, they've still got rights, they may not have the right to stay

04:59.160 --> 05:02.600
in your country, but that doesn't mean that you can do with them what you will.

05:02.600 --> 05:06.040
All that being said, it's not like Republicans are uniquely guilty for shipping around new

05:06.040 --> 05:07.280
arrivals for political gain.

05:07.280 --> 05:10.760
Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot did the same thing a week before this story broke.

05:10.760 --> 05:15.200
Abbott sent 150 migrants to Chicago, since Chicago is a sanctuary city, and Lightfoot,

05:15.200 --> 05:18.600
a Democrat, packed them up and sent them to the nearby Republican voting town of Burr

05:18.600 --> 05:22.640
Ridge, specifically to a hotel that one year ago partnered with churches and charitable

05:22.640 --> 05:27.440
organizations to temporarily house Afghani refugees after the fall of the Afghan government.

05:27.440 --> 05:30.960
But that was a one-time deal specific to that event, which you could argue that the Americans

05:30.960 --> 05:34.760
had a moral obligation to help out with, considering that they caused the Afghanistan situation

05:34.760 --> 05:35.760
in the first place.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.720
But ultimately, it's a hotel, not a refugee facility.

05:37.720 --> 05:42.040
All of this is justified by what the Republicans have come to call the Biden administration's

05:42.040 --> 05:43.040
ghost flights.

05:43.040 --> 05:46.760
The term ghost flight refers to what Republicans call secret flights that carry migrants from

05:46.760 --> 05:48.760
the border to communities across the country.

05:48.760 --> 05:52.960
Up until the start of 2022, ghost flight actually referred to planes that flew around with little

05:52.960 --> 05:56.760
or no passengers to preserve an airline's runway spot at a destination airport, where

05:56.760 --> 06:00.240
it would have cost them more to not fly the plane and lose the spot to their competition

06:00.240 --> 06:01.840
than it would to just fly an empty plane.

06:01.840 --> 06:05.000
But in this context, it refers to something different, referring to the Biden administration

06:05.000 --> 06:08.640
secretly packing migrants onto planes at the border under the cover of darkness and

06:08.640 --> 06:10.480
shipping them off to the American interior.

06:10.480 --> 06:15.120
At least one video secretly shot by former House Rep Lou Barletta at an airport in Pennsylvania

06:15.120 --> 06:18.320
seemed to show the nighttime journey of a bunch of newly arrived migrants.

06:18.320 --> 06:21.180
But the Republican interpretation of these events seems to be wrong.

06:21.180 --> 06:22.440
The flights aren't secret.

06:22.440 --> 06:26.200
The law authorizing them was first signed in 2000 by Bill Clinton as the Victims of

06:26.200 --> 06:31.740
Trafficking and Violence Protection Act and was renewed in 2003, 2006, and 2008 by George

06:31.740 --> 06:32.740
Bush.

06:32.740 --> 06:36.300
It was launched in 2011, but Obama brought it back in 2013 as an amendment to the Violence

06:36.300 --> 06:37.700
Against Women Act, which passed.

06:37.700 --> 06:42.200
The amendment lapsed in 2017 and Trump reauthorized it, this time as its own bill again, the Trafficking

06:42.200 --> 06:44.140
Victims Protection Act of 2017.

06:44.140 --> 06:47.100
By the way, that Violence Against Women Act, which the Trafficking Victims Protection Act

06:47.100 --> 06:51.900
was temporarily stapled onto by Obama in 2013, it lapsed as a result of the 2018 government

06:51.900 --> 06:54.700
shutdown, but had an attempted revival in April of 2019.

06:54.700 --> 06:59.400
However, it was Senate Democrats desperate to not give Trump any sort of a win who refused

06:59.400 --> 07:01.360
to get on board with reauthorizing it.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.880
Biden eventually signed it back into law in March of 2022.

07:03.880 --> 07:08.800
I don't know if Biden's 2022 reauthorizing also revived the stapled version of the Trafficking

07:08.800 --> 07:12.760
Act, considering that it became its own thing again back in 2018, but if it did, it was

07:12.760 --> 07:14.460
likely up for renewal anyway.

07:14.460 --> 07:17.680
The point is, though, the federal government hasn't been secretly flying migrants around

07:17.680 --> 07:19.280
the country to settle all over the place.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.720
It's been openly doing it and has been on and off for over 20 years.

07:22.720 --> 07:26.400
You can argue that practice should be stopped, but to imply it's being done in secret away

07:26.400 --> 07:29.400
from any sort of oversight and hidden from the people just isn't true.

07:29.440 --> 07:32.180
That kind of rhetoric only serves to prop up the narrative that it's the Republican

07:32.180 --> 07:35.600
heroes who have uncovered the truth they're trying to hide, when in actuality it's not

07:35.600 --> 07:37.000
a secret, it's normal.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.880
You can argue it shouldn't be normal, and maybe it shouldn't be, but you haven't

07:39.880 --> 07:41.960
discovered a conspiracy here, guys.

07:41.960 --> 07:45.440
The actual conversation, though, is that the Biden administration and Trump and Obama and

07:45.440 --> 07:49.780
Bush and Clinton, under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, have done for years what Abbott

07:49.780 --> 07:51.240
and DeSantis are doing now.

07:51.240 --> 07:54.020
Setting aside DeSantis lying to the migrants to get them on board the Martha's Vineyard

07:54.020 --> 07:56.720
plane, and that's a pretty big thing to set aside, but let's roll with it.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.640
Setting that aside, what is the difference?

07:58.640 --> 08:02.000
Nobody seems to have a coherent answer to that question, but the Washington Post did

08:02.000 --> 08:03.160
attempt to give one.

08:03.160 --> 08:06.440
The difference between DeSantis' migrant flights and the Biden administration's.

08:06.440 --> 08:10.660
Just as criticisms of the Biden administration's supposed ghost flights have long been overblown,

08:10.660 --> 08:13.760
the comparison between the two situations mismatches in some key ways.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.380
The whataboutism drumbeat has picked up in recent days.

08:16.380 --> 08:19.760
You know, just saying, that's whataboutism isn't actually a reply.

08:19.760 --> 08:23.840
When you bring up whataboutism, you're noticing that the topic has suddenly shifted from DeSantis'

08:23.840 --> 08:27.520
migrant flights to Biden's, which doesn't excuse DeSantis, true, but it also doesn't

08:27.520 --> 08:28.520
excuse Biden.

08:28.520 --> 08:32.800
Talking about A right now, not B, is a true statement, but it serves to excuse neither

08:32.800 --> 08:36.840
A nor B. The criticisms often skirt over the fact that these flights carry children, and

08:36.840 --> 08:37.840
that's important.

08:37.840 --> 08:41.160
In fact, the government, by law, cannot hold unaccompanied minors in border facilities

08:41.160 --> 08:45.040
for more than 72 hours, and they must be cared for while they are transported to relatives,

08:45.040 --> 08:46.200
sponsors, or shelters.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.200
Fair enough.

08:47.200 --> 08:50.800
We should probably ask why there are so many unaccompanied minors coming across the American

08:50.800 --> 08:51.800
border.

08:51.800 --> 08:54.120
Maybe there's something wrong with how the border is currently being handled, but asking

08:54.120 --> 08:56.360
questions in 2022 is racist.

08:56.360 --> 08:59.640
Another key distinction, it is indeed the federal government that is charged with enforcing

08:59.640 --> 09:00.640
immigration law.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.800
Also true, but as far as I know, DeSantis and Abbott aren't enforcing immigration

09:03.800 --> 09:04.800
law.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.200
They aren't deciding who stays or goes, they're sending people who stay to sanctuary

09:07.200 --> 09:08.240
cities and states.

09:08.240 --> 09:12.480
The buses and planes used by Republican governors, by contrast, convey people of all ages, and

09:12.480 --> 09:13.620
they are asylum seekers.

09:13.620 --> 09:16.860
The program is set up for people who have been processed by federal immigration officials

09:16.860 --> 09:18.320
and are awaiting their dates in court.

09:18.320 --> 09:21.660
DeSantis and Abbott have said that these migrants signed waivers, meaning their transportation

09:21.660 --> 09:25.160
was elective rather than required by law, and if that's all it turns out to be, there's

09:25.160 --> 09:26.520
likely to be no legal trouble.

09:26.520 --> 09:29.520
Some migrants have said they were grateful to be transported to more welcoming places,

09:29.520 --> 09:32.940
but Democrats, immigrant advocates, and some of the migrants themselves have suggested

09:32.940 --> 09:35.200
the migrants might have been misled into participating.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.240
That's the stated reason most are objecting to the practice.

09:38.240 --> 09:41.840
And here we go, the only real criticism that doesn't just fall back on, well this is

09:41.840 --> 09:43.280
just how the system is.

09:43.280 --> 09:46.680
Abbott and DeSantis claim that the migrants have consented to being moved around.

09:46.680 --> 09:47.680
And that's pretty believable.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.760
If you tell a migrant, listen, Texas and Florida won't help you, but California and

09:50.760 --> 09:52.320
New York will, do you want to go there?

09:52.320 --> 09:53.600
They're probably going to say yes.

09:53.600 --> 09:57.200
The article even says if that's the case, there's actually no reasonable objection

09:57.200 --> 09:58.200
to the practice.

09:58.200 --> 10:01.060
The issue is, some people claim it's happened without their consent, and you can make a

10:01.060 --> 10:05.040
pretty strong argument that for the Martha's Vineyard stunt, the act of deliberately lying

10:05.040 --> 10:08.060
about where the plane was going constitutes a lack of consent.

10:08.060 --> 10:11.100
At that point, it probably does become a form of human trafficking.

10:11.100 --> 10:14.800
The Martha's Vineyard migrants came from Texas originally, I think it was the feds

10:14.800 --> 10:17.700
that shipped them to Florida, then it was Florida that shipped them to Martha's Vineyard

10:17.700 --> 10:19.280
while telling them they were going to Boston.

10:19.280 --> 10:23.320
The sheriff of their point of origin, from Bexar County, Texas, submitted certification

10:23.360 --> 10:27.040
to have the migrants apply for U visas, which are a special type of visa for the victims

10:27.040 --> 10:30.680
of a crime, to remain in the United States to ensure that when the time comes, they are

10:30.680 --> 10:33.600
available to police or the court system as witnesses.

10:33.600 --> 10:37.840
The sheriff has said, based on the claims of migrants being transported from Bexar County

10:37.840 --> 10:42.360
under false pretenses, we are investigating this case as possible unlawful restraint.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.080
There's two levels of malicious intent here.

10:44.080 --> 10:47.940
The first one is how the Democratic establishment views migrants in the first place.

10:47.940 --> 10:51.200
They want the country to take them in, and if you disagree with them, you're a racist.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.620
But they don't want to be the ones who actually have to care for them.

10:53.620 --> 10:54.900
They want you to do that.

10:54.900 --> 10:57.840
They want to appear virtuous by opening the borders and saying everyone's welcome.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.240
But when it comes to footing that bill, they're not going to do it themselves.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.240
They're going to point at middle America.

11:02.240 --> 11:06.180
Migrants are welcome, just not in the rich, affluent Democratic neighborhoods where senators

11:06.180 --> 11:07.320
and philanthropists live.

11:07.320 --> 11:10.560
You're going to be the one who houses and clothes these people, because it makes them

11:10.560 --> 11:12.160
feel like they're doing the right thing.

11:12.160 --> 11:16.320
This attitude is best spelled out by the Delusional Reason article advocating that Republicans

11:16.320 --> 11:19.480
should take in immigrants to stick it to Biden's broken border policies.

11:19.480 --> 11:20.780
Like fucking what?

11:20.780 --> 11:24.980
The second level, though, is that among the completely reasonable responses from the right,

11:24.980 --> 11:30.060
which basically amount to no, fuck you, take responsibility for your own decisions, Democrats,

11:30.060 --> 11:33.000
where Abbott and DeSantis have been moving migrants to neighborhoods who actually voted

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
for them.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.640
During that reasonable response, it seems like DeSantis may have actually fucked up.

11:37.640 --> 11:41.640
It's actually quite bad if the Martha's Vineyard migrants were sent there under false

11:41.640 --> 11:42.640
pretenses.

11:42.640 --> 11:46.360
That likely is some kind of trafficking or kidnapping or unlawful restraint or whatever

11:46.360 --> 11:50.540
the fuck, and the shadow of that terrible move is going to loom over the whole project.

11:50.540 --> 11:54.020
The conversation has shifted away from Texas didn't vote for these migrants, so we're

11:54.020 --> 11:57.260
sending them to New York who did vote for them, which is entirely reasonable, to DeSantis

11:57.260 --> 12:00.580
kidnapped migrants and shipped them away for a political stunt, which is entirely awful.

12:00.580 --> 12:04.300
If you're saying in your head right now, Dev, why are you focusing on this one tiny

12:04.300 --> 12:07.380
bad action by DeSantis when it's the Democrats that are the problem?

12:07.380 --> 12:09.020
They shouldn't be doing any of this.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.140
Everything they've been doing is wrong.

12:10.140 --> 12:11.640
You haven't been listening to me.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.740
If you're going up against the establishment, you have to be squeaky clean.

12:14.740 --> 12:18.100
I've said in multiple videos now, if you are better than them, you have to behave better

12:18.100 --> 12:19.100
than them.

12:19.100 --> 12:22.300
That's the reason these migrant transports have been happening since January without

12:22.300 --> 12:25.940
a peep from anyone, but only turned into a viral story in September.

12:25.940 --> 12:30.580
It's because the Republicans were actually doing everything properly and above board,

12:30.580 --> 12:34.460
and there was no reasonable objection against it until DeSantis fucked up.
