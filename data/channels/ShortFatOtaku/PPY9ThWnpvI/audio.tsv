0	9240	Another thing I missed while I was off falling apart was the whole Martha's Vineyard migrant
9240	10240	thing.
10240	11240	Here's the TLDR.
11240	15720	In September of 2022, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis flew 50 immigrants, mostly refugees
15720	17520	from Venezuela, to Martha's Vineyard.
17520	21220	Martha's Vineyard, an island off the coast of Massachusetts, is one of the wealthiest
21220	26880	locations in the entire United States, a reasonably isolated spot where movie stars, politicians,
26880	30400	and billionaires keep vacation homes that sit empty for most of the year.
30400	33600	It's a scenic, beautiful location with lots of old buildings and history.
33600	38200	It's also one of the most deeply blue voting locations in the entire country, on par with
38200	40200	places like New York and California.
40200	44440	DeSantis' decision to transport the 50 immigrants to Martha's Vineyard is best understood
44440	48880	in the context of a wider program by Texas Governor Greg Abbott doing something very
48880	53040	similar, busing people arriving in his state from other countries to places like LA, New
53040	54880	York City, and Washington DC.
54880	59000	The Texas state government has transported over 10,000 immigrants out of the red state
59000	62000	to these predominantly blue areas since the beginning of 2022.
62000	65840	A lot of people on the broader left are complaining about the state of affairs.
65840	69780	Your rank and file internet leftoids are screeching at everyone on the right, calling them racist
69780	72000	and fascist for this, but they do that for everything.
72000	75040	Establishment Democrat politicians are claiming that DeSantis and Abbott are engaging in human
75040	78440	trafficking by moving the migrants from red states to blue states.
78440	82160	Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns went on CNN to compare the move to the Holocaust, since
82160	85720	his upcoming documentary is partially about the Holocaust, saying it's the abstraction
85720	86720	of human life.
86720	88760	This is coming straight out of the authoritarian playbook.
88760	92280	This is what's so disturbing about DeSantis, to use human beings, to weaponize human beings
92280	93480	for political purpose.
93480	96840	And the incredibly rich people of Martha's Vineyard were very quick to say that they
96840	98560	just can't help the migrants.
98560	99560	There's no room here.
99560	104720	We have, at some point in time, they have to move from here to somewhere else, right?
104720	111880	We cannot, we don't have the services to take care of 50 immigrants, and we certainly don't
111880	112880	have housing.
112880	118560	We're in a housing crisis as we are on this island, and so we don't, we can't house everyone
118560	120880	here that lives here and works here.
120880	122760	We don't have housing for 50 more people.
122760	126960	A quick peek on local Martha's Vineyard Facebook groups will show these people ripping each
126960	130440	other apart for not wanting to give up their vacant rental properties and summer homes
130440	133340	for the migrants to live in, which is just hilarious to watch.
133340	135300	After all, diversity is our strength, isn't it?
135300	137680	Why not make Martha's Vineyard more diverse?
137680	141760	Places like Martha's Vineyard voted for and support things like illegal immigration, open
141800	144360	borders policies, and sanctuary states and cities.
144360	146620	Why should their communities not be the sanctuary?
146620	149880	Why should they not be the ones to support the consequences of their votes?
149880	153460	The red states overwhelmingly voted against these policies, so it makes sense that they
153460	155880	transfer these people to the states that actually want them.
155880	156880	What's the issue here?
156880	160640	Well, seeing as I'm a few weeks late on the story, some further info has come out that
160640	164020	I assume right-leaning YouTubers and pundits probably haven't talked about, either because
164020	167160	it goes against their biases or because the news cycle has moved on.
167160	169760	One good thing about being slow is I can actually get the whole picture.
169760	172760	Firstly, while it's really funny to watch the hyper-rich of Martha's Vineyard rip
172760	176160	each other apart because they can't just virtue signal anymore they're actually being
176160	179360	called to do something in reality, some of them actually did step up.
179360	182800	A lot of them failed to put their money where their mouth is and revealed themselves to
182800	185760	be the racists we always knew them to be, which is why the memes that came out of this
185760	186840	were so hilarious.
186840	187840	But some of them actually did it.
187840	191080	When the 50 migrants arrived at Martha's Vineyard, part of the community actually turned
191080	194120	a local community center into a shelter, providing beds and food.
194120	197280	They may not have the infrastructure to let them live on the island in perpetuity, and
197280	200080	their reaction was pretty funny when they finally left, but it's not like they were
200080	202600	instantly abandoned the second they stepped off the plane.
202600	207320	Secondly, it turns out that, at least in the case of the specific 50 migrants that DeSantis
207320	209360	sent to Migrant's Vineyard, they were lied to.
209360	212560	They were enticed to get on the plane by Florida officials, telling them they were actually
212560	214520	headed to Boston to get work papers.
214520	218160	Judd Legum, a freelance journalist, got a hold of the brochures that were handed out
218160	219880	by the officials to the 50 migrants.
219880	223640	The brochures claimed to be on behalf of the state of Massachusetts, and they offer benefits
223640	228080	like eight months of cash payments, food, job training, and housing to new refugees.
228080	231640	The programs listed on the brochure are real in Massachusetts, but the pamphlet wasn't
231640	233200	made by anybody from that state.
233200	234760	It was made by the state of Florida.
234760	235760	To me, this is scummy.
235760	238580	Okay, your state doesn't want to deal with the effects of an open borders policy you
238580	239580	didn't vote for.
239580	240580	I understand that part.
240580	242320	You want to send the migrants to the locations who voted for them.
242320	243320	Got it.
243320	245480	You entice people with the benefits of those other locations.
245480	246480	Even that's okay.
246480	249840	But to tell them, hey, you're going to Boston to get all this shit in the brochure, and
249840	252320	instead send them to Martha's Vineyard for a political stunt?
252320	253480	That's actually pretty shitty.
253480	257000	And DeSantis knew that he had to basically pull the old switcheroo on this one, which
257000	261320	is why he deliberately lied about migrants on other planes leaving Florida to the press.
261320	265040	Though it is reasonable to send migrants from states who don't want them and didn't vote
265040	269160	for them to states that do and did, that's not quite what DeSantis is doing here.
269160	272580	He's trying to keep his stunt in the news cycle for one more round in order to raise
272580	273580	his own profile.
273580	276420	It's not about sending migrants to sanctuary cities or states.
276420	278680	If so, they would have been sent to Boston as promised.
278680	282640	Instead, it's about sticking it to the democratic wealthy elite, which is fine, but it's using
282640	286200	migrants as a pawn to do it while lying to them, which isn't fine.
286200	289640	Even if it turns out that these people are 100% illegal immigrants, there's no legitimate
289640	293200	reason for asylum status or anything like that, then what you should do is deport them,
293200	295880	not ship them around the country, to raise your electability with your base.
295880	299160	They're still people, they've still got rights, they may not have the right to stay
299160	302600	in your country, but that doesn't mean that you can do with them what you will.
302600	306040	All that being said, it's not like Republicans are uniquely guilty for shipping around new
306040	307280	arrivals for political gain.
307280	310760	Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot did the same thing a week before this story broke.
310760	315200	Abbott sent 150 migrants to Chicago, since Chicago is a sanctuary city, and Lightfoot,
315200	318600	a Democrat, packed them up and sent them to the nearby Republican voting town of Burr
318600	322640	Ridge, specifically to a hotel that one year ago partnered with churches and charitable
322640	327440	organizations to temporarily house Afghani refugees after the fall of the Afghan government.
327440	330960	But that was a one-time deal specific to that event, which you could argue that the Americans
330960	334760	had a moral obligation to help out with, considering that they caused the Afghanistan situation
334760	335760	in the first place.
335760	337720	But ultimately, it's a hotel, not a refugee facility.
337720	342040	All of this is justified by what the Republicans have come to call the Biden administration's
342040	343040	ghost flights.
343040	346760	The term ghost flight refers to what Republicans call secret flights that carry migrants from
346760	348760	the border to communities across the country.
348760	352960	Up until the start of 2022, ghost flight actually referred to planes that flew around with little
352960	356760	or no passengers to preserve an airline's runway spot at a destination airport, where
356760	360240	it would have cost them more to not fly the plane and lose the spot to their competition
360240	361840	than it would to just fly an empty plane.
361840	365000	But in this context, it refers to something different, referring to the Biden administration
365000	368640	secretly packing migrants onto planes at the border under the cover of darkness and
368640	370480	shipping them off to the American interior.
370480	375120	At least one video secretly shot by former House Rep Lou Barletta at an airport in Pennsylvania
375120	378320	seemed to show the nighttime journey of a bunch of newly arrived migrants.
378320	381180	But the Republican interpretation of these events seems to be wrong.
381180	382440	The flights aren't secret.
382440	386200	The law authorizing them was first signed in 2000 by Bill Clinton as the Victims of
386200	391740	Trafficking and Violence Protection Act and was renewed in 2003, 2006, and 2008 by George
391740	392740	Bush.
392740	396300	It was launched in 2011, but Obama brought it back in 2013 as an amendment to the Violence
396300	397700	Against Women Act, which passed.
397700	402200	The amendment lapsed in 2017 and Trump reauthorized it, this time as its own bill again, the Trafficking
402200	404140	Victims Protection Act of 2017.
404140	407100	By the way, that Violence Against Women Act, which the Trafficking Victims Protection Act
407100	411900	was temporarily stapled onto by Obama in 2013, it lapsed as a result of the 2018 government
411900	414700	shutdown, but had an attempted revival in April of 2019.
414700	419400	However, it was Senate Democrats desperate to not give Trump any sort of a win who refused
419400	421360	to get on board with reauthorizing it.
421400	423880	Biden eventually signed it back into law in March of 2022.
423880	428800	I don't know if Biden's 2022 reauthorizing also revived the stapled version of the Trafficking
428800	432760	Act, considering that it became its own thing again back in 2018, but if it did, it was
432760	434460	likely up for renewal anyway.
434460	437680	The point is, though, the federal government hasn't been secretly flying migrants around
437680	439280	the country to settle all over the place.
439280	442720	It's been openly doing it and has been on and off for over 20 years.
442720	446400	You can argue that practice should be stopped, but to imply it's being done in secret away
446400	449400	from any sort of oversight and hidden from the people just isn't true.
449440	452180	That kind of rhetoric only serves to prop up the narrative that it's the Republican
452180	455600	heroes who have uncovered the truth they're trying to hide, when in actuality it's not
455600	457000	a secret, it's normal.
457000	459880	You can argue it shouldn't be normal, and maybe it shouldn't be, but you haven't
459880	461960	discovered a conspiracy here, guys.
461960	465440	The actual conversation, though, is that the Biden administration and Trump and Obama and
465440	469780	Bush and Clinton, under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, have done for years what Abbott
469780	471240	and DeSantis are doing now.
471240	474020	Setting aside DeSantis lying to the migrants to get them on board the Martha's Vineyard
474020	476720	plane, and that's a pretty big thing to set aside, but let's roll with it.
476720	478640	Setting that aside, what is the difference?
478640	482000	Nobody seems to have a coherent answer to that question, but the Washington Post did
482000	483160	attempt to give one.
483160	486440	The difference between DeSantis' migrant flights and the Biden administration's.
486440	490660	Just as criticisms of the Biden administration's supposed ghost flights have long been overblown,
490660	493760	the comparison between the two situations mismatches in some key ways.
493760	496380	The whataboutism drumbeat has picked up in recent days.
496380	499760	You know, just saying, that's whataboutism isn't actually a reply.
499760	503840	When you bring up whataboutism, you're noticing that the topic has suddenly shifted from DeSantis'
503840	507520	migrant flights to Biden's, which doesn't excuse DeSantis, true, but it also doesn't
507520	508520	excuse Biden.
508520	512800	Talking about A right now, not B, is a true statement, but it serves to excuse neither
512800	516840	A nor B. The criticisms often skirt over the fact that these flights carry children, and
516840	517840	that's important.
517840	521160	In fact, the government, by law, cannot hold unaccompanied minors in border facilities
521160	525040	for more than 72 hours, and they must be cared for while they are transported to relatives,
525040	526200	sponsors, or shelters.
526200	527200	Fair enough.
527200	530800	We should probably ask why there are so many unaccompanied minors coming across the American
530800	531800	border.
531800	534120	Maybe there's something wrong with how the border is currently being handled, but asking
534120	536360	questions in 2022 is racist.
536360	539640	Another key distinction, it is indeed the federal government that is charged with enforcing
539640	540640	immigration law.
540640	543800	Also true, but as far as I know, DeSantis and Abbott aren't enforcing immigration
543800	544800	law.
544800	547200	They aren't deciding who stays or goes, they're sending people who stay to sanctuary
547200	548240	cities and states.
548240	552480	The buses and planes used by Republican governors, by contrast, convey people of all ages, and
552480	553620	they are asylum seekers.
553620	556860	The program is set up for people who have been processed by federal immigration officials
556860	558320	and are awaiting their dates in court.
558320	561660	DeSantis and Abbott have said that these migrants signed waivers, meaning their transportation
561660	565160	was elective rather than required by law, and if that's all it turns out to be, there's
565160	566520	likely to be no legal trouble.
566520	569520	Some migrants have said they were grateful to be transported to more welcoming places,
569520	572940	but Democrats, immigrant advocates, and some of the migrants themselves have suggested
572940	575200	the migrants might have been misled into participating.
575200	578240	That's the stated reason most are objecting to the practice.
578240	581840	And here we go, the only real criticism that doesn't just fall back on, well this is
581840	583280	just how the system is.
583280	586680	Abbott and DeSantis claim that the migrants have consented to being moved around.
586680	587680	And that's pretty believable.
587680	590760	If you tell a migrant, listen, Texas and Florida won't help you, but California and
590760	592320	New York will, do you want to go there?
592320	593600	They're probably going to say yes.
593600	597200	The article even says if that's the case, there's actually no reasonable objection
597200	598200	to the practice.
598200	601060	The issue is, some people claim it's happened without their consent, and you can make a
601060	605040	pretty strong argument that for the Martha's Vineyard stunt, the act of deliberately lying
605040	608060	about where the plane was going constitutes a lack of consent.
608060	611100	At that point, it probably does become a form of human trafficking.
611100	614800	The Martha's Vineyard migrants came from Texas originally, I think it was the feds
614800	617700	that shipped them to Florida, then it was Florida that shipped them to Martha's Vineyard
617700	619280	while telling them they were going to Boston.
619280	623320	The sheriff of their point of origin, from Bexar County, Texas, submitted certification
623360	627040	to have the migrants apply for U visas, which are a special type of visa for the victims
627040	630680	of a crime, to remain in the United States to ensure that when the time comes, they are
630680	633600	available to police or the court system as witnesses.
633600	637840	The sheriff has said, based on the claims of migrants being transported from Bexar County
637840	642360	under false pretenses, we are investigating this case as possible unlawful restraint.
642360	644080	There's two levels of malicious intent here.
644080	647940	The first one is how the Democratic establishment views migrants in the first place.
647940	651200	They want the country to take them in, and if you disagree with them, you're a racist.
651200	653620	But they don't want to be the ones who actually have to care for them.
653620	654900	They want you to do that.
654900	657840	They want to appear virtuous by opening the borders and saying everyone's welcome.
657840	660240	But when it comes to footing that bill, they're not going to do it themselves.
660240	662240	They're going to point at middle America.
662240	666180	Migrants are welcome, just not in the rich, affluent Democratic neighborhoods where senators
666180	667320	and philanthropists live.
667320	670560	You're going to be the one who houses and clothes these people, because it makes them
670560	672160	feel like they're doing the right thing.
672160	676320	This attitude is best spelled out by the Delusional Reason article advocating that Republicans
676320	679480	should take in immigrants to stick it to Biden's broken border policies.
679480	680780	Like fucking what?
680780	684980	The second level, though, is that among the completely reasonable responses from the right,
684980	690060	which basically amount to no, fuck you, take responsibility for your own decisions, Democrats,
690060	693000	where Abbott and DeSantis have been moving migrants to neighborhoods who actually voted
693000	694000	for them.
694000	697640	During that reasonable response, it seems like DeSantis may have actually fucked up.
697640	701640	It's actually quite bad if the Martha's Vineyard migrants were sent there under false
701640	702640	pretenses.
702640	706360	That likely is some kind of trafficking or kidnapping or unlawful restraint or whatever
706360	710540	the fuck, and the shadow of that terrible move is going to loom over the whole project.
710540	714020	The conversation has shifted away from Texas didn't vote for these migrants, so we're
714020	717260	sending them to New York who did vote for them, which is entirely reasonable, to DeSantis
717260	720580	kidnapped migrants and shipped them away for a political stunt, which is entirely awful.
720580	724300	If you're saying in your head right now, Dev, why are you focusing on this one tiny
724300	727380	bad action by DeSantis when it's the Democrats that are the problem?
727380	729020	They shouldn't be doing any of this.
729020	730140	Everything they've been doing is wrong.
730140	731640	You haven't been listening to me.
731640	734740	If you're going up against the establishment, you have to be squeaky clean.
734740	738100	I've said in multiple videos now, if you are better than them, you have to behave better
738100	739100	than them.
739100	742300	That's the reason these migrant transports have been happening since January without
742300	745940	a peep from anyone, but only turned into a viral story in September.
745940	750580	It's because the Republicans were actually doing everything properly and above board,
750580	754460	and there was no reasonable objection against it until DeSantis fucked up.
