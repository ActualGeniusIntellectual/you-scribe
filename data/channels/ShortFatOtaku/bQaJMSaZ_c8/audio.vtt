WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.440
Alright, alright, you saw the title of the video, we already know what I'm talking about

00:09.440 --> 00:10.440
today.

00:10.440 --> 00:11.440
Let's just play the clip, alright?

00:11.440 --> 00:13.840
Thank you so much, that's really our time, I apologize.

00:13.840 --> 00:16.200
You can't do that to black media!

00:16.200 --> 00:21.080
I can't do that to white media and black media because my wife has to go on at six o'clock.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
Okay.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.200
Oh, uh oh, I'm in trouble.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.240
Listen, you gotta come see us when you come to New York, VP Biden.

00:27.240 --> 00:28.240
I will.

00:28.240 --> 00:31.720
It's a long way until November, we got more questions.

00:31.720 --> 00:32.720
You got more questions.

00:32.720 --> 00:36.880
But I tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, and you

00:36.880 --> 00:37.880
ain't black.

00:37.880 --> 00:41.540
It don't have nothing to do with Trump, it has to do with the fact I want something for

00:41.540 --> 00:42.540
my community.

00:42.540 --> 00:46.240
Oh boy, I'd give that gaffe 10 Bidens out of 10.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.880
And really, at this point, we don't know where that came from.

00:48.880 --> 00:52.040
Was that somehow a result of Biden's well-known speech impediment?

00:52.040 --> 00:56.440
Did it come from the fact that he obviously has dementia and is declining before our very

00:56.440 --> 00:57.440
eyes?

00:57.640 --> 01:02.480
This is simply another instance of the Democratic mask slipping, showing us how that party views

01:02.480 --> 01:04.560
black people in the United States.

01:04.560 --> 01:08.720
Now Biden is being dragged on the internet and rightfully so.

01:08.720 --> 01:13.560
A white person telling black people how to be black just seems ridiculous in the face

01:13.560 --> 01:14.560
of it.

01:14.560 --> 01:17.640
So it's not just conservatives and Republicans coming after him.

01:17.640 --> 01:22.820
It's centrists, it's Bernie bros and other never Biden types on the left.

01:22.820 --> 01:26.480
And yes, it's black people of all political persuasions.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.200
Do you know who's not coming for him?

01:28.200 --> 01:29.620
The mainstream media.

01:29.620 --> 01:32.200
Analysis by John Blake of CNN.

01:32.200 --> 01:36.600
What Biden said was outrageous, but some say so was the reaction.

01:36.600 --> 01:41.120
Oh really, you think the problem with the situation is not the braindead stuff that

01:41.120 --> 01:44.080
Biden said, but the fact that everyone's mad at him?

01:44.080 --> 01:48.980
Remember, this is coming from the same outlet that threatened to dox somebody because they

01:48.980 --> 01:53.400
made a wrestling gif of Trump slamming the CNN logo.

01:53.400 --> 01:56.360
I'm not saying Biden's not getting dragged, he is.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.440
But there's some obvious hypocrisy here.

01:58.440 --> 02:03.080
If this were anybody else but the Democratic presidential nominee, the media would be publishing

02:03.080 --> 02:04.480
article after article.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.360
It would be all over the news cycle.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.460
They wouldn't let it go.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.580
But because it's Biden, they're publishing propaganda instead.

02:10.580 --> 02:15.600
And man, if you go to Twitter and you look at the hashtag you ain't black, it is absolutely

02:15.600 --> 02:17.480
wild, man.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.560
Everyone is descending on Biden right now.

02:19.560 --> 02:26.120
I'd say it's about 90% people clowning on Biden and 10% people trying to distract by

02:26.120 --> 02:30.640
calling Trump a racist, Islamophobe, xenophobe, homophobe, etc, etc, etc.

02:30.640 --> 02:31.900
We've all heard it before.

02:31.900 --> 02:37.840
And of course, you've got YouAintBlack.com run by Black Voices for Trump.

02:37.840 --> 02:40.880
Text WOKE to 88022.

02:40.880 --> 02:47.600
It is so strange to see, like, basic political maneuvering and normal election punditry turn

02:47.600 --> 02:49.640
into shitposting.

02:49.640 --> 02:54.600
Radical leftists have often said that everyone and everything is racist.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.920
Everything is sexist.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.080
Everything is racist.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.080
Everything is homophobic.

02:58.080 --> 03:00.260
And you have to point it all out.

03:00.260 --> 03:03.440
And I mean, there's an obvious problem with that right on the surface of it.

03:03.440 --> 03:06.300
Pointing it out doesn't actually change anything.

03:06.300 --> 03:14.560
But more importantly, if everyone truly is racist, and it's subconscious, you can't even

03:14.560 --> 03:20.200
change it, then it's almost like their crusade is a fool's errand, if that makes any sense.

03:20.200 --> 03:26.120
The best you can hope for is, despite your biases, do you treat everyone fairly?

03:26.120 --> 03:28.520
If so, then that's probably good enough.

03:28.520 --> 03:31.000
And frankly, the left doesn't right now.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.680
But okay, if everyone is racist, then surely everyone on the left is racist, right?

03:36.680 --> 03:41.200
And surely we should hold them accountable for their racism the same way that they hold

03:41.200 --> 03:44.240
literally everyone else accountable for their racism.

03:44.240 --> 03:47.340
But of course, they don't actually want that to happen.

03:47.340 --> 03:53.060
When they say everyone is racist, what they mean is, if you're not constantly self-flagellating

03:53.060 --> 03:56.820
about how racist you are, you need to be punished.

03:56.820 --> 04:02.020
This is why the radical left has no idea what to do with a black Trump supporter.

04:02.020 --> 04:06.240
Someone like Kanye West, or Candace Owens, or Diamond and Silk.

04:06.240 --> 04:07.400
Those people aren't perfect.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.420
There's obviously things that they've done that you can criticize them for.

04:10.420 --> 04:16.620
Yo Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'ma let you finish, but Beyonce had one of the

04:16.620 --> 04:21.140
best videos of all time.

04:21.140 --> 04:25.420
George Bush doesn't care about black people.

04:25.420 --> 04:31.340
But voting Republican, or being a conservative, or even being like a centrist or libertarian

04:31.340 --> 04:32.540
is not one of them.

04:32.540 --> 04:37.020
The left has this view of the right, where they think that the right simply views black

04:37.020 --> 04:41.100
people as genetically inferior, in much the same way that the Nazis did.

04:41.100 --> 04:45.240
And because they are genetically inferior, they should be enslaved, maybe tightly controlled,

04:45.240 --> 04:46.440
maybe exterminated.

04:46.440 --> 04:51.440
And I'm sure that there are a very small minority of people on the extreme right, the legitimate

04:51.440 --> 04:53.940
neo-Nazis, who actually feel this way.

04:53.940 --> 04:58.000
But the left's racism towards black people is actually kind of similar.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.140
They've given themselves the white man's burden.

05:00.140 --> 05:04.440
They view themselves as superior, and black people as a child race.

05:04.440 --> 05:09.520
But they don't want to exterminate them, they simply want to guide them on the proper path.

05:09.520 --> 05:15.520
This is known as the soft bigotry of low expectations, where you don't want to see a group enslaved

05:15.520 --> 05:20.120
or destroyed, you simply want to see them stripped of all agency, and become a class

05:20.120 --> 05:23.160
of people who are completely dependent on the state.

05:23.160 --> 05:29.000
Black conservatives, black libertarians, black centrists, even black center lefties are often

05:29.000 --> 05:35.240
slandered with terms like Uncle Tom, or House Nega, or most commonly of all, race traitor

05:35.240 --> 05:37.080
by the radical left.

05:37.080 --> 05:42.760
Sometimes by like Black Lives Matter activists, sometimes by white college-aged SJWs.

05:42.760 --> 05:46.800
Oh man, I hope I can find the video so I can put it in.

05:46.800 --> 05:51.580
I'd say about three or four years ago I watched a clip of a bunch of white students saying

05:51.580 --> 05:57.540
that it was racist to require an ID when you go to vote, because black people might not

05:57.540 --> 06:02.120
know that that was a rule, they might not understand, they might not know where to get

06:02.120 --> 06:06.680
an ID, and then it immediately cut to a bunch of black people who were like, yeah I know

06:06.680 --> 06:09.840
where to get ID, you just gotta go down to the DMV, it's right here, here's the address.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.840
Do you have an opinion on voter ID laws?

06:11.920 --> 06:15.920
Uh, yeah, they're usually pretty racist, and they're bad.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.920
I think voter ID laws are a way to perpetuate racism.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.720
Would you go as far as to say that those laws are racist?

06:21.720 --> 06:22.720
For sure.

06:22.720 --> 06:25.280
Do you think it suppresses the African-American vote?

06:25.280 --> 06:30.240
Definitely, because they're less likely to have state IDs.

06:30.240 --> 06:37.360
Minority voters are less likely to have the kinds of IDs that have been described or required.

06:37.400 --> 06:42.800
These types of people don't live in areas with easy access to DMBs or other places where

06:42.800 --> 06:43.800
they can get identification.

06:43.800 --> 06:44.800
Do you have ID normally?

06:44.800 --> 06:45.800
Do you carry ID around?

06:45.800 --> 06:46.800
Yes, I have state ID.

06:46.800 --> 06:47.800
Do you carry ID?

06:47.800 --> 06:48.800
Yes, I do.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.800
Do you know anybody who's black versus who doesn't carry ID?

06:51.800 --> 06:52.800
No.

06:52.800 --> 06:53.800
Everyone that I know has an ID.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.800
Why would they think we don't have ID?

06:55.800 --> 06:56.800
That's a lie.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.800
Why would they say that?

06:58.800 --> 06:59.800
Do you have ID?

06:59.800 --> 07:00.800
Yes.

07:00.800 --> 07:04.800
Because I have my ID and my friends have their ID, so we know what we need to carry around.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.960
Everybody that I know has an ID, like that's one of the things you need to walk around

07:08.960 --> 07:09.960
with New York with.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.360
Those are legit IDs.

07:11.360 --> 07:15.960
I heard a lot also that black people can't figure out how to get to the DMV.

07:15.960 --> 07:16.960
Really?

07:16.960 --> 07:18.960
What does that say to you?

07:18.960 --> 07:20.600
I know what that is, it's on 25th Street.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.600
Do you know where the DMV is around here?

07:22.600 --> 07:25.200
It's on 125th Street and 3rd Avenue, I believe.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.200
You know where to get there?

07:26.200 --> 07:27.200
Yeah.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.200
Do you have a problem getting there if you have to get there?

07:28.200 --> 07:29.200
No.

07:29.200 --> 07:34.560
I understand why calling somebody a race traitor, because they have different politics, taking

07:34.560 --> 07:39.120
away their black card, telling them they're not really black, I can see why that is a

07:39.120 --> 07:43.760
powerful weapon that those on the left wield against the black community.

07:43.760 --> 07:48.440
Because the black community, at least in the United States, is based on the horrors of

07:48.440 --> 07:53.200
slavery and more recently the horrors of fatherlessness and drug addiction.

07:53.200 --> 07:58.040
There's an entire generation of lost black children out there who grew up with one parent

07:58.040 --> 08:00.400
who was most likely addicted to something or other.

08:00.400 --> 08:04.480
And then those people raised in that environment are told that everything that's happened

08:04.480 --> 08:06.920
to them happened because of systemic racism.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.720
Because it's the white man's fault.

08:08.720 --> 08:14.360
Because several hundred years ago, white people who no longer exist enslaved their ancestors.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.880
Those people feel like outsiders in their own nations.

08:16.880 --> 08:20.360
They certainly don't have a viable family structure to hold onto.

08:20.360 --> 08:21.800
So what do they have left?

08:21.800 --> 08:24.000
It's basically just the race.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.640
So they have this idea of what it means to be a black person, they have this idea of

08:27.640 --> 08:30.880
blackness and around that springs this community.

08:30.880 --> 08:35.480
So when members of that community say to a black person, you're not black because your

08:35.480 --> 08:40.380
politics are wrong, I can imagine that it would probably feel like being an outcast

08:40.380 --> 08:41.880
from a community of outcasts.

08:41.880 --> 08:46.160
And the Democratic Party has been preying on this state of affairs for decades.

08:46.160 --> 08:50.520
There is a wing of the Democrats that are basically professional race hustlers.

08:50.520 --> 08:54.800
They believe that all black people owe the Democratic Party their votes because they're

08:54.800 --> 08:58.120
the party that advocated for overturning the Jim Crow laws.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.860
And fair enough, they were in the right on that.

09:00.860 --> 09:05.940
But because of it, they view the black community almost as if it's their property.

09:05.940 --> 09:09.380
And that kind of attitude strips black people of their agency.

09:09.380 --> 09:13.500
But the cold hard truth is, there is no political blackness.

09:13.500 --> 09:18.020
No politician is owed your vote simply because of the colour of your skin.

09:18.020 --> 09:21.820
Joe Biden's comments are probably just the ramblings of an old man who is in his declining

09:21.820 --> 09:22.820
years.

09:22.820 --> 09:27.220
But at the same time, because Biden is literally losing his mind, that means he's more likely

09:27.220 --> 09:30.040
to go complete mask off, which is what he did.

09:30.040 --> 09:34.640
The way the Democratic Party views black people is their inconvenient truth.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.300
And Biden is just the latest example of this.

09:37.300 --> 09:40.920
You guys remember when Ayanna Pressley had this brain dead take?

09:40.920 --> 09:47.120
Because we don't need any more brown faces that don't want to be a brown voice.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.120
We don't need black faces that don't want to be a black voice.

09:50.120 --> 09:53.120
We don't need Muslims that don't want to be a Muslim voice.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.880
We don't need queers that don't want to be a queer voice.

09:55.880 --> 09:59.200
What she's talking about is being politically black.

09:59.200 --> 10:03.740
She's not outright stating that you're not black if you don't vote for her and her party.

10:03.740 --> 10:07.160
But that's because she's 46, not 96.

10:07.160 --> 10:11.840
And she's still got it together mentally enough to not completely blow the Democratic cover.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.320
But it is the same attitude.

10:13.320 --> 10:19.080
Now, of course, I'm not saying that there's not at least a section of the black community

10:19.080 --> 10:22.680
that will simply go for those who give them the most money or something.

10:22.680 --> 10:26.600
We all remember that crackhead dancing in the street because Obama gave her a cell phone

10:26.600 --> 10:27.600
in 2008.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.600
Obama!

10:28.600 --> 10:29.600
You got Obama's phone?

10:29.600 --> 10:30.600
Yes!

10:30.600 --> 10:33.600
Everybody in Cleveland, low minority, got Obama's phone.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.600
Keep Obama in president, you know?

10:35.600 --> 10:37.440
He gave us a phone.

10:37.440 --> 10:41.440
And as soon as the Trump Bucks came through, the coronavirus relief, there were a bunch

10:41.440 --> 10:44.600
of black people on Twitter saying the exact same thing about Trump.

10:44.600 --> 10:50.040
Now I'm just going to tell you motherfucking niggas straight out the door, don't fuck with

10:50.040 --> 10:52.040
my motherfucking president.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.040
Do you understand me?

10:54.040 --> 10:57.040
Nigga, we ride with Donald Trump over here, nigga.

10:57.480 --> 11:00.480
Draco, we ain't playing with you motherfucking nigga.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.480
You understand me?

11:01.480 --> 11:05.480
Keep my motherfucking president name right to mouth.

11:05.480 --> 11:06.480
Fuck, nigga!

11:06.480 --> 11:08.800
But this actually isn't much of a racial issue.

11:08.800 --> 11:12.160
I think this is kind of highlighted because of the stereotype and it's kind of funny that

11:12.160 --> 11:13.160
way.

11:13.160 --> 11:17.560
If you go back over to Twitter and you search for the two terms, Trump and nigga together,

11:17.560 --> 11:21.440
the stuff that you find is absolutely hilarious.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.920
But my point here is this.

11:22.920 --> 11:26.960
The claim that Trump is a racist just doesn't seem to stick, and it's because he holds

11:26.960 --> 11:29.400
black people to the same standard as everyone else.

11:29.400 --> 11:33.800
He expects them to be decent people, he expects them to be responsible, he expects them to

11:33.800 --> 11:38.680
take charge of their own lives, and if they have problems, to make an honest effort at

11:38.680 --> 11:39.680
fixing them.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.760
That's not racism, it's just responsibility.

11:41.760 --> 11:48.200
Meanwhile, Joe Biden's 50-year political career is filled with instances where he supports

11:48.200 --> 11:53.680
excessive punishment for minor crimes, efforts that would disproportionately affect black

11:53.680 --> 11:54.680
people.

11:54.680 --> 12:01.320
Every major crime bill that's come out of this Congress has had the name Joe Biden on

12:01.320 --> 12:02.320
that bill.

12:02.320 --> 12:05.120
We do everything but hang people for jaywalking in this bill.

12:05.120 --> 12:10.880
And it's these very same efforts that groups like Black Lives Matter point at to say that

12:10.880 --> 12:12.920
our society is still a racist one.

12:12.920 --> 12:16.560
But you will find Biden's name on a lot of that legislation.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.240
Do you think you'll find Trump's?

12:18.240 --> 12:22.760
This is a fundamental problem with the left's political philosophy when it comes to race.

12:22.760 --> 12:26.040
Because to them, having black skin isn't the real blackness.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.300
The real blackness is thinking black.

12:28.300 --> 12:30.520
The real blackness is voting black.

12:30.520 --> 12:33.760
To them, blackness is not who you are, but how you behave.

12:33.760 --> 12:37.520
And it's no surprise to me that it's not a race thing.

12:37.520 --> 12:42.840
And in fact, I would argue that the Trump bucks came about during an emergency situation,

12:42.840 --> 12:44.480
while the Obama phones didn't.

12:44.480 --> 12:48.600
That was literally just the government handing out free stuff, inviting the black community

12:48.600 --> 12:51.560
to once again come and suckle at the teat of it.

12:51.560 --> 12:56.160
More and more, black people in the United States are finally unshackling themselves

12:56.160 --> 12:57.840
from the victimhood narrative.

12:57.840 --> 13:03.200
And this is good news for everyone, with the exception of those who demand that black people

13:03.200 --> 13:10.160
remain subservient, meek, afraid, and constantly voting blue.

13:10.160 --> 13:13.840
Hello my friends, I've got a very special announcement here at the end of the video.

13:13.840 --> 13:18.320
Every year here in Canada, the Anime North Convention happens right around now.

13:18.320 --> 13:20.960
In fact, it should be going on this very second.

13:20.960 --> 13:24.760
Except for the fact that Anime North 2020 was cancelled because of the coronavirus.

13:24.760 --> 13:28.920
In light of that, I figured now would be a good time to release some old Anime North

13:28.920 --> 13:31.440
2019 footage we have saved up.

13:31.440 --> 13:36.400
Dave and Dom, who work on the channel with me, went to Anime North 2019 last year.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.880
They took the big expensive camera that I've got, shot a whole bunch of footage from the

13:39.880 --> 13:43.600
convention, and then when they got back, uh, proceeded to lose it.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.400
The footage, not the camera.

13:45.400 --> 13:50.280
And I found the footage, so now I'm editing it and putting it up, over on my side channel,

13:50.280 --> 13:51.280
the Devkit.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.840
If you're bummed out about not being able to attend Anime North right now, or this kind

13:54.840 --> 13:57.900
of content just sounds like something you might want to check out, click the video on

13:57.900 --> 13:59.960
screen right now, that'll take you to it.

13:59.960 --> 14:03.860
And hey, while you're at it, consider subbing to my side channels, they're also on the screen

14:03.860 --> 14:04.860
too.

14:04.860 --> 14:06.640
Alright chums, that about ends the PSA.

14:06.640 --> 14:10.080
I'll see you tonight on my Twitch stream, and if not, I'll see you for tomorrow's video.

14:10.080 --> 14:10.580
I love you.
