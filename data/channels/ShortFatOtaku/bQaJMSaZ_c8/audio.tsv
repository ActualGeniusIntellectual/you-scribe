0	9440	Alright, alright, you saw the title of the video, we already know what I'm talking about
9440	10440	today.
10440	11440	Let's just play the clip, alright?
11440	13840	Thank you so much, that's really our time, I apologize.
13840	16200	You can't do that to black media!
16200	21080	I can't do that to white media and black media because my wife has to go on at six o'clock.
21080	22080	Okay.
22080	24200	Oh, uh oh, I'm in trouble.
24200	27240	Listen, you gotta come see us when you come to New York, VP Biden.
27240	28240	I will.
28240	31720	It's a long way until November, we got more questions.
31720	32720	You got more questions.
32720	36880	But I tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, and you
36880	37880	ain't black.
37880	41540	It don't have nothing to do with Trump, it has to do with the fact I want something for
41540	42540	my community.
42540	46240	Oh boy, I'd give that gaffe 10 Bidens out of 10.
46240	48880	And really, at this point, we don't know where that came from.
48880	52040	Was that somehow a result of Biden's well-known speech impediment?
52040	56440	Did it come from the fact that he obviously has dementia and is declining before our very
56440	57440	eyes?
57640	62480	This is simply another instance of the Democratic mask slipping, showing us how that party views
62480	64560	black people in the United States.
64560	68720	Now Biden is being dragged on the internet and rightfully so.
68720	73560	A white person telling black people how to be black just seems ridiculous in the face
73560	74560	of it.
74560	77640	So it's not just conservatives and Republicans coming after him.
77640	82820	It's centrists, it's Bernie bros and other never Biden types on the left.
82820	86480	And yes, it's black people of all political persuasions.
86520	88200	Do you know who's not coming for him?
88200	89620	The mainstream media.
89620	92200	Analysis by John Blake of CNN.
92200	96600	What Biden said was outrageous, but some say so was the reaction.
96600	101120	Oh really, you think the problem with the situation is not the braindead stuff that
101120	104080	Biden said, but the fact that everyone's mad at him?
104080	108980	Remember, this is coming from the same outlet that threatened to dox somebody because they
108980	113400	made a wrestling gif of Trump slamming the CNN logo.
113400	116360	I'm not saying Biden's not getting dragged, he is.
116360	118440	But there's some obvious hypocrisy here.
118440	123080	If this were anybody else but the Democratic presidential nominee, the media would be publishing
123080	124480	article after article.
124480	126360	It would be all over the news cycle.
126360	127460	They wouldn't let it go.
127460	130580	But because it's Biden, they're publishing propaganda instead.
130580	135600	And man, if you go to Twitter and you look at the hashtag you ain't black, it is absolutely
135600	137480	wild, man.
137480	139560	Everyone is descending on Biden right now.
139560	146120	I'd say it's about 90% people clowning on Biden and 10% people trying to distract by
146120	150640	calling Trump a racist, Islamophobe, xenophobe, homophobe, etc, etc, etc.
150640	151900	We've all heard it before.
151900	157840	And of course, you've got YouAintBlack.com run by Black Voices for Trump.
157840	160880	Text WOKE to 88022.
160880	167600	It is so strange to see, like, basic political maneuvering and normal election punditry turn
167600	169640	into shitposting.
169640	174600	Radical leftists have often said that everyone and everything is racist.
174600	175920	Everything is sexist.
175920	177080	Everything is racist.
177080	178080	Everything is homophobic.
178080	180260	And you have to point it all out.
180260	183440	And I mean, there's an obvious problem with that right on the surface of it.
183440	186300	Pointing it out doesn't actually change anything.
186300	194560	But more importantly, if everyone truly is racist, and it's subconscious, you can't even
194560	200200	change it, then it's almost like their crusade is a fool's errand, if that makes any sense.
200200	206120	The best you can hope for is, despite your biases, do you treat everyone fairly?
206120	208520	If so, then that's probably good enough.
208520	211000	And frankly, the left doesn't right now.
211000	216680	But okay, if everyone is racist, then surely everyone on the left is racist, right?
216680	221200	And surely we should hold them accountable for their racism the same way that they hold
221200	224240	literally everyone else accountable for their racism.
224240	227340	But of course, they don't actually want that to happen.
227340	233060	When they say everyone is racist, what they mean is, if you're not constantly self-flagellating
233060	236820	about how racist you are, you need to be punished.
236820	242020	This is why the radical left has no idea what to do with a black Trump supporter.
242020	246240	Someone like Kanye West, or Candace Owens, or Diamond and Silk.
246240	247400	Those people aren't perfect.
247400	250420	There's obviously things that they've done that you can criticize them for.
250420	256620	Yo Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'ma let you finish, but Beyonce had one of the
256620	261140	best videos of all time.
261140	265420	George Bush doesn't care about black people.
265420	271340	But voting Republican, or being a conservative, or even being like a centrist or libertarian
271340	272540	is not one of them.
272540	277020	The left has this view of the right, where they think that the right simply views black
277020	281100	people as genetically inferior, in much the same way that the Nazis did.
281100	285240	And because they are genetically inferior, they should be enslaved, maybe tightly controlled,
285240	286440	maybe exterminated.
286440	291440	And I'm sure that there are a very small minority of people on the extreme right, the legitimate
291440	293940	neo-Nazis, who actually feel this way.
293940	298000	But the left's racism towards black people is actually kind of similar.
298000	300140	They've given themselves the white man's burden.
300140	304440	They view themselves as superior, and black people as a child race.
304440	309520	But they don't want to exterminate them, they simply want to guide them on the proper path.
309520	315520	This is known as the soft bigotry of low expectations, where you don't want to see a group enslaved
315520	320120	or destroyed, you simply want to see them stripped of all agency, and become a class
320120	323160	of people who are completely dependent on the state.
323160	329000	Black conservatives, black libertarians, black centrists, even black center lefties are often
329000	335240	slandered with terms like Uncle Tom, or House Nega, or most commonly of all, race traitor
335240	337080	by the radical left.
337080	342760	Sometimes by like Black Lives Matter activists, sometimes by white college-aged SJWs.
342760	346800	Oh man, I hope I can find the video so I can put it in.
346800	351580	I'd say about three or four years ago I watched a clip of a bunch of white students saying
351580	357540	that it was racist to require an ID when you go to vote, because black people might not
357540	362120	know that that was a rule, they might not understand, they might not know where to get
362120	366680	an ID, and then it immediately cut to a bunch of black people who were like, yeah I know
366680	369840	where to get ID, you just gotta go down to the DMV, it's right here, here's the address.
369840	371840	Do you have an opinion on voter ID laws?
371920	375920	Uh, yeah, they're usually pretty racist, and they're bad.
375920	378920	I think voter ID laws are a way to perpetuate racism.
378920	381720	Would you go as far as to say that those laws are racist?
381720	382720	For sure.
382720	385280	Do you think it suppresses the African-American vote?
385280	390240	Definitely, because they're less likely to have state IDs.
390240	397360	Minority voters are less likely to have the kinds of IDs that have been described or required.
397400	402800	These types of people don't live in areas with easy access to DMBs or other places where
402800	403800	they can get identification.
403800	404800	Do you have ID normally?
404800	405800	Do you carry ID around?
405800	406800	Yes, I have state ID.
406800	407800	Do you carry ID?
407800	408800	Yes, I do.
408800	411800	Do you know anybody who's black versus who doesn't carry ID?
411800	412800	No.
412800	413800	Everyone that I know has an ID.
413800	415800	Why would they think we don't have ID?
415800	416800	That's a lie.
416800	418800	Why would they say that?
418800	419800	Do you have ID?
419800	420800	Yes.
420800	424800	Because I have my ID and my friends have their ID, so we know what we need to carry around.
425240	428960	Everybody that I know has an ID, like that's one of the things you need to walk around
428960	429960	with New York with.
429960	431360	Those are legit IDs.
431360	435960	I heard a lot also that black people can't figure out how to get to the DMV.
435960	436960	Really?
436960	438960	What does that say to you?
438960	440600	I know what that is, it's on 25th Street.
440600	442600	Do you know where the DMV is around here?
442600	445200	It's on 125th Street and 3rd Avenue, I believe.
445200	446200	You know where to get there?
446200	447200	Yeah.
447200	448200	Do you have a problem getting there if you have to get there?
448200	449200	No.
449200	454560	I understand why calling somebody a race traitor, because they have different politics, taking
454560	459120	away their black card, telling them they're not really black, I can see why that is a
459120	463760	powerful weapon that those on the left wield against the black community.
463760	468440	Because the black community, at least in the United States, is based on the horrors of
468440	473200	slavery and more recently the horrors of fatherlessness and drug addiction.
473200	478040	There's an entire generation of lost black children out there who grew up with one parent
478040	480400	who was most likely addicted to something or other.
480400	484480	And then those people raised in that environment are told that everything that's happened
484480	486920	to them happened because of systemic racism.
486920	488720	Because it's the white man's fault.
488720	494360	Because several hundred years ago, white people who no longer exist enslaved their ancestors.
494360	496880	Those people feel like outsiders in their own nations.
496880	500360	They certainly don't have a viable family structure to hold onto.
500360	501800	So what do they have left?
501800	504000	It's basically just the race.
504000	507640	So they have this idea of what it means to be a black person, they have this idea of
507640	510880	blackness and around that springs this community.
510880	515480	So when members of that community say to a black person, you're not black because your
515480	520380	politics are wrong, I can imagine that it would probably feel like being an outcast
520380	521880	from a community of outcasts.
521880	526160	And the Democratic Party has been preying on this state of affairs for decades.
526160	530520	There is a wing of the Democrats that are basically professional race hustlers.
530520	534800	They believe that all black people owe the Democratic Party their votes because they're
534800	538120	the party that advocated for overturning the Jim Crow laws.
538120	540860	And fair enough, they were in the right on that.
540860	545940	But because of it, they view the black community almost as if it's their property.
545940	549380	And that kind of attitude strips black people of their agency.
549380	553500	But the cold hard truth is, there is no political blackness.
553500	558020	No politician is owed your vote simply because of the colour of your skin.
558020	561820	Joe Biden's comments are probably just the ramblings of an old man who is in his declining
561820	562820	years.
562820	567220	But at the same time, because Biden is literally losing his mind, that means he's more likely
567220	570040	to go complete mask off, which is what he did.
570040	574640	The way the Democratic Party views black people is their inconvenient truth.
574640	577300	And Biden is just the latest example of this.
577300	580920	You guys remember when Ayanna Pressley had this brain dead take?
580920	587120	Because we don't need any more brown faces that don't want to be a brown voice.
587120	590120	We don't need black faces that don't want to be a black voice.
590120	593120	We don't need Muslims that don't want to be a Muslim voice.
593120	595880	We don't need queers that don't want to be a queer voice.
595880	599200	What she's talking about is being politically black.
599200	603740	She's not outright stating that you're not black if you don't vote for her and her party.
603740	607160	But that's because she's 46, not 96.
607160	611840	And she's still got it together mentally enough to not completely blow the Democratic cover.
611840	613320	But it is the same attitude.
613320	619080	Now, of course, I'm not saying that there's not at least a section of the black community
619080	622680	that will simply go for those who give them the most money or something.
622680	626600	We all remember that crackhead dancing in the street because Obama gave her a cell phone
626600	627600	in 2008.
627600	628600	Obama!
628600	629600	You got Obama's phone?
629600	630600	Yes!
630600	633600	Everybody in Cleveland, low minority, got Obama's phone.
633600	635600	Keep Obama in president, you know?
635600	637440	He gave us a phone.
637440	641440	And as soon as the Trump Bucks came through, the coronavirus relief, there were a bunch
641440	644600	of black people on Twitter saying the exact same thing about Trump.
644600	650040	Now I'm just going to tell you motherfucking niggas straight out the door, don't fuck with
650040	652040	my motherfucking president.
652040	654040	Do you understand me?
654040	657040	Nigga, we ride with Donald Trump over here, nigga.
657480	660480	Draco, we ain't playing with you motherfucking nigga.
660480	661480	You understand me?
661480	665480	Keep my motherfucking president name right to mouth.
665480	666480	Fuck, nigga!
666480	668800	But this actually isn't much of a racial issue.
668800	672160	I think this is kind of highlighted because of the stereotype and it's kind of funny that
672160	673160	way.
673160	677560	If you go back over to Twitter and you search for the two terms, Trump and nigga together,
677560	681440	the stuff that you find is absolutely hilarious.
681440	682920	But my point here is this.
682920	686960	The claim that Trump is a racist just doesn't seem to stick, and it's because he holds
686960	689400	black people to the same standard as everyone else.
689400	693800	He expects them to be decent people, he expects them to be responsible, he expects them to
693800	698680	take charge of their own lives, and if they have problems, to make an honest effort at
698680	699680	fixing them.
699680	701760	That's not racism, it's just responsibility.
701760	708200	Meanwhile, Joe Biden's 50-year political career is filled with instances where he supports
708200	713680	excessive punishment for minor crimes, efforts that would disproportionately affect black
713680	714680	people.
714680	721320	Every major crime bill that's come out of this Congress has had the name Joe Biden on
721320	722320	that bill.
722320	725120	We do everything but hang people for jaywalking in this bill.
725120	730880	And it's these very same efforts that groups like Black Lives Matter point at to say that
730880	732920	our society is still a racist one.
732920	736560	But you will find Biden's name on a lot of that legislation.
736560	738240	Do you think you'll find Trump's?
738240	742760	This is a fundamental problem with the left's political philosophy when it comes to race.
742760	746040	Because to them, having black skin isn't the real blackness.
746040	748300	The real blackness is thinking black.
748300	750520	The real blackness is voting black.
750520	753760	To them, blackness is not who you are, but how you behave.
753760	757520	And it's no surprise to me that it's not a race thing.
757520	762840	And in fact, I would argue that the Trump bucks came about during an emergency situation,
762840	764480	while the Obama phones didn't.
764480	768600	That was literally just the government handing out free stuff, inviting the black community
768600	771560	to once again come and suckle at the teat of it.
771560	776160	More and more, black people in the United States are finally unshackling themselves
776160	777840	from the victimhood narrative.
777840	783200	And this is good news for everyone, with the exception of those who demand that black people
783200	790160	remain subservient, meek, afraid, and constantly voting blue.
790160	793840	Hello my friends, I've got a very special announcement here at the end of the video.
793840	798320	Every year here in Canada, the Anime North Convention happens right around now.
798320	800960	In fact, it should be going on this very second.
800960	804760	Except for the fact that Anime North 2020 was cancelled because of the coronavirus.
804760	808920	In light of that, I figured now would be a good time to release some old Anime North
808920	811440	2019 footage we have saved up.
811440	816400	Dave and Dom, who work on the channel with me, went to Anime North 2019 last year.
816400	819880	They took the big expensive camera that I've got, shot a whole bunch of footage from the
819880	823600	convention, and then when they got back, uh, proceeded to lose it.
823600	825400	The footage, not the camera.
825400	830280	And I found the footage, so now I'm editing it and putting it up, over on my side channel,
830280	831280	the Devkit.
831280	834840	If you're bummed out about not being able to attend Anime North right now, or this kind
834840	837900	of content just sounds like something you might want to check out, click the video on
837900	839960	screen right now, that'll take you to it.
839960	843860	And hey, while you're at it, consider subbing to my side channels, they're also on the screen
843860	844860	too.
844860	846640	Alright chums, that about ends the PSA.
846640	850080	I'll see you tonight on my Twitch stream, and if not, I'll see you for tomorrow's video.
850080	850580	I love you.
