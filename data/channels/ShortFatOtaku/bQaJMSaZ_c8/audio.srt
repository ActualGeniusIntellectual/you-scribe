1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
Alright, alright, you saw the title of the video, we already know what I'm talking about

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,440
today.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,440
Let's just play the clip, alright?

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,840
Thank you so much, that's really our time, I apologize.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,200
You can't do that to black media!

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,080
I can't do that to white media and black media because my wife has to go on at six o'clock.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
Okay.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,200
Oh, uh oh, I'm in trouble.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,240
Listen, you gotta come see us when you come to New York, VP Biden.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,240
I will.

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,720
It's a long way until November, we got more questions.

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,720
You got more questions.

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,880
But I tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, and you

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,880
ain't black.

15
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,540
It don't have nothing to do with Trump, it has to do with the fact I want something for

16
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,540
my community.

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,240
Oh boy, I'd give that gaffe 10 Bidens out of 10.

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,880
And really, at this point, we don't know where that came from.

19
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,040
Was that somehow a result of Biden's well-known speech impediment?

20
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,440
Did it come from the fact that he obviously has dementia and is declining before our very

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,440
eyes?

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,480
This is simply another instance of the Democratic mask slipping, showing us how that party views

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,560
black people in the United States.

24
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,720
Now Biden is being dragged on the internet and rightfully so.

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,560
A white person telling black people how to be black just seems ridiculous in the face

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
of it.

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,640
So it's not just conservatives and Republicans coming after him.

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,820
It's centrists, it's Bernie bros and other never Biden types on the left.

29
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,480
And yes, it's black people of all political persuasions.

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,200
Do you know who's not coming for him?

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,620
The mainstream media.

32
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,200
Analysis by John Blake of CNN.

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,600
What Biden said was outrageous, but some say so was the reaction.

34
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,120
Oh really, you think the problem with the situation is not the braindead stuff that

35
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,080
Biden said, but the fact that everyone's mad at him?

36
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,980
Remember, this is coming from the same outlet that threatened to dox somebody because they

37
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,400
made a wrestling gif of Trump slamming the CNN logo.

38
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,360
I'm not saying Biden's not getting dragged, he is.

39
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,440
But there's some obvious hypocrisy here.

40
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,080
If this were anybody else but the Democratic presidential nominee, the media would be publishing

41
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,480
article after article.

42
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,360
It would be all over the news cycle.

43
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,460
They wouldn't let it go.

44
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,580
But because it's Biden, they're publishing propaganda instead.

45
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,600
And man, if you go to Twitter and you look at the hashtag you ain't black, it is absolutely

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,480
wild, man.

47
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,560
Everyone is descending on Biden right now.

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,120
I'd say it's about 90% people clowning on Biden and 10% people trying to distract by

49
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,640
calling Trump a racist, Islamophobe, xenophobe, homophobe, etc, etc, etc.

50
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,900
We've all heard it before.

51
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,840
And of course, you've got YouAintBlack.com run by Black Voices for Trump.

52
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,880
Text WOKE to 88022.

53
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:47,600
It is so strange to see, like, basic political maneuvering and normal election punditry turn

54
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,640
into shitposting.

55
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,600
Radical leftists have often said that everyone and everything is racist.

56
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,920
Everything is sexist.

57
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,080
Everything is racist.

58
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
Everything is homophobic.

59
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,260
And you have to point it all out.

60
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,440
And I mean, there's an obvious problem with that right on the surface of it.

61
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,300
Pointing it out doesn't actually change anything.

62
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:14,560
But more importantly, if everyone truly is racist, and it's subconscious, you can't even

63
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,200
change it, then it's almost like their crusade is a fool's errand, if that makes any sense.

64
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,120
The best you can hope for is, despite your biases, do you treat everyone fairly?

65
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,520
If so, then that's probably good enough.

66
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,000
And frankly, the left doesn't right now.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,680
But okay, if everyone is racist, then surely everyone on the left is racist, right?

68
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,200
And surely we should hold them accountable for their racism the same way that they hold

69
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,240
literally everyone else accountable for their racism.

70
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,340
But of course, they don't actually want that to happen.

71
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,060
When they say everyone is racist, what they mean is, if you're not constantly self-flagellating

72
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,820
about how racist you are, you need to be punished.

73
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:02,020
This is why the radical left has no idea what to do with a black Trump supporter.

74
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,240
Someone like Kanye West, or Candace Owens, or Diamond and Silk.

75
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,400
Those people aren't perfect.

76
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,420
There's obviously things that they've done that you can criticize them for.

77
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:16,620
Yo Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'ma let you finish, but Beyonce had one of the

78
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,140
best videos of all time.

79
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,420
George Bush doesn't care about black people.

80
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:31,340
But voting Republican, or being a conservative, or even being like a centrist or libertarian

81
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,540
is not one of them.

82
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,020
The left has this view of the right, where they think that the right simply views black

83
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,100
people as genetically inferior, in much the same way that the Nazis did.

84
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,240
And because they are genetically inferior, they should be enslaved, maybe tightly controlled,

85
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,440
maybe exterminated.

86
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,440
And I'm sure that there are a very small minority of people on the extreme right, the legitimate

87
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,940
neo-Nazis, who actually feel this way.

88
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,000
But the left's racism towards black people is actually kind of similar.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,140
They've given themselves the white man's burden.

90
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,440
They view themselves as superior, and black people as a child race.

91
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,520
But they don't want to exterminate them, they simply want to guide them on the proper path.

92
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,520
This is known as the soft bigotry of low expectations, where you don't want to see a group enslaved

93
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,120
or destroyed, you simply want to see them stripped of all agency, and become a class

94
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,160
of people who are completely dependent on the state.

95
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,000
Black conservatives, black libertarians, black centrists, even black center lefties are often

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,240
slandered with terms like Uncle Tom, or House Nega, or most commonly of all, race traitor

97
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,080
by the radical left.

98
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,760
Sometimes by like Black Lives Matter activists, sometimes by white college-aged SJWs.

99
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,800
Oh man, I hope I can find the video so I can put it in.

100
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,580
I'd say about three or four years ago I watched a clip of a bunch of white students saying

101
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:57,540
that it was racist to require an ID when you go to vote, because black people might not

102
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:02,120
know that that was a rule, they might not understand, they might not know where to get

103
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,680
an ID, and then it immediately cut to a bunch of black people who were like, yeah I know

104
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,840
where to get ID, you just gotta go down to the DMV, it's right here, here's the address.

105
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
Do you have an opinion on voter ID laws?

106
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,920
Uh, yeah, they're usually pretty racist, and they're bad.

107
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,920
I think voter ID laws are a way to perpetuate racism.

108
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,720
Would you go as far as to say that those laws are racist?

109
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,720
For sure.

110
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,280
Do you think it suppresses the African-American vote?

111
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,240
Definitely, because they're less likely to have state IDs.

112
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,360
Minority voters are less likely to have the kinds of IDs that have been described or required.

113
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,800
These types of people don't live in areas with easy access to DMBs or other places where

114
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
they can get identification.

115
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Do you have ID normally?

116
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Do you carry ID around?

117
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Yes, I have state ID.

118
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Do you carry ID?

119
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Yes, I do.

120
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Do you know anybody who's black versus who doesn't carry ID?

121
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
No.

122
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Everyone that I know has an ID.

123
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Why would they think we don't have ID?

124
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
That's a lie.

125
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Why would they say that?

126
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Do you have ID?

127
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Yes.

128
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Because I have my ID and my friends have their ID, so we know what we need to carry around.

129
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,960
Everybody that I know has an ID, like that's one of the things you need to walk around

130
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
with New York with.

131
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,360
Those are legit IDs.

132
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,960
I heard a lot also that black people can't figure out how to get to the DMV.

133
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
Really?

134
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960
What does that say to you?

135
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,600
I know what that is, it's on 25th Street.

136
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Do you know where the DMV is around here?

137
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,200
It's on 125th Street and 3rd Avenue, I believe.

138
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
You know where to get there?

139
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
Yeah.

140
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
Do you have a problem getting there if you have to get there?

141
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
No.

142
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,560
I understand why calling somebody a race traitor, because they have different politics, taking

143
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,120
away their black card, telling them they're not really black, I can see why that is a

144
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,760
powerful weapon that those on the left wield against the black community.

145
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,440
Because the black community, at least in the United States, is based on the horrors of

146
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,200
slavery and more recently the horrors of fatherlessness and drug addiction.

147
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,040
There's an entire generation of lost black children out there who grew up with one parent

148
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,400
who was most likely addicted to something or other.

149
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,480
And then those people raised in that environment are told that everything that's happened

150
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,920
to them happened because of systemic racism.

151
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,720
Because it's the white man's fault.

152
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,360
Because several hundred years ago, white people who no longer exist enslaved their ancestors.

153
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,880
Those people feel like outsiders in their own nations.

154
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,360
They certainly don't have a viable family structure to hold onto.

155
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,800
So what do they have left?

156
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,000
It's basically just the race.

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,640
So they have this idea of what it means to be a black person, they have this idea of

158
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,880
blackness and around that springs this community.

159
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,480
So when members of that community say to a black person, you're not black because your

160
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,380
politics are wrong, I can imagine that it would probably feel like being an outcast

161
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,880
from a community of outcasts.

162
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,160
And the Democratic Party has been preying on this state of affairs for decades.

163
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,520
There is a wing of the Democrats that are basically professional race hustlers.

164
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,800
They believe that all black people owe the Democratic Party their votes because they're

165
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,120
the party that advocated for overturning the Jim Crow laws.

166
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,860
And fair enough, they were in the right on that.

167
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,940
But because of it, they view the black community almost as if it's their property.

168
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,380
And that kind of attitude strips black people of their agency.

169
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,500
But the cold hard truth is, there is no political blackness.

170
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,020
No politician is owed your vote simply because of the colour of your skin.

171
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,820
Joe Biden's comments are probably just the ramblings of an old man who is in his declining

172
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,820
years.

173
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,220
But at the same time, because Biden is literally losing his mind, that means he's more likely

174
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,040
to go complete mask off, which is what he did.

175
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,640
The way the Democratic Party views black people is their inconvenient truth.

176
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,300
And Biden is just the latest example of this.

177
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,920
You guys remember when Ayanna Pressley had this brain dead take?

178
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,120
Because we don't need any more brown faces that don't want to be a brown voice.

179
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,120
We don't need black faces that don't want to be a black voice.

180
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,120
We don't need Muslims that don't want to be a Muslim voice.

181
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,880
We don't need queers that don't want to be a queer voice.

182
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,200
What she's talking about is being politically black.

183
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,740
She's not outright stating that you're not black if you don't vote for her and her party.

184
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,160
But that's because she's 46, not 96.

185
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,840
And she's still got it together mentally enough to not completely blow the Democratic cover.

186
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,320
But it is the same attitude.

187
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,080
Now, of course, I'm not saying that there's not at least a section of the black community

188
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,680
that will simply go for those who give them the most money or something.

189
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,600
We all remember that crackhead dancing in the street because Obama gave her a cell phone

190
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
in 2008.

191
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Obama!

192
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
You got Obama's phone?

193
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Yes!

194
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Everybody in Cleveland, low minority, got Obama's phone.

195
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Keep Obama in president, you know?

196
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,440
He gave us a phone.

197
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,440
And as soon as the Trump Bucks came through, the coronavirus relief, there were a bunch

198
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,600
of black people on Twitter saying the exact same thing about Trump.

199
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,040
Now I'm just going to tell you motherfucking niggas straight out the door, don't fuck with

200
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
my motherfucking president.

201
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040
Do you understand me?

202
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Nigga, we ride with Donald Trump over here, nigga.

203
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Draco, we ain't playing with you motherfucking nigga.

204
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
You understand me?

205
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,480
Keep my motherfucking president name right to mouth.

206
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Fuck, nigga!

207
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,800
But this actually isn't much of a racial issue.

208
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,160
I think this is kind of highlighted because of the stereotype and it's kind of funny that

209
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
way.

210
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,560
If you go back over to Twitter and you search for the two terms, Trump and nigga together,

211
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,440
the stuff that you find is absolutely hilarious.

212
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,920
But my point here is this.

213
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,960
The claim that Trump is a racist just doesn't seem to stick, and it's because he holds

214
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,400
black people to the same standard as everyone else.

215
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,800
He expects them to be decent people, he expects them to be responsible, he expects them to

216
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,680
take charge of their own lives, and if they have problems, to make an honest effort at

217
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
fixing them.

218
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,760
That's not racism, it's just responsibility.

219
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,200
Meanwhile, Joe Biden's 50-year political career is filled with instances where he supports

220
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,680
excessive punishment for minor crimes, efforts that would disproportionately affect black

221
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,680
people.

222
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:01,320
Every major crime bill that's come out of this Congress has had the name Joe Biden on

223
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
that bill.

224
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,120
We do everything but hang people for jaywalking in this bill.

225
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,880
And it's these very same efforts that groups like Black Lives Matter point at to say that

226
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,920
our society is still a racist one.

227
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,560
But you will find Biden's name on a lot of that legislation.

228
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,240
Do you think you'll find Trump's?

229
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,760
This is a fundamental problem with the left's political philosophy when it comes to race.

230
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,040
Because to them, having black skin isn't the real blackness.

231
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,300
The real blackness is thinking black.

232
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,520
The real blackness is voting black.

233
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,760
To them, blackness is not who you are, but how you behave.

234
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,520
And it's no surprise to me that it's not a race thing.

235
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,840
And in fact, I would argue that the Trump bucks came about during an emergency situation,

236
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,480
while the Obama phones didn't.

237
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,600
That was literally just the government handing out free stuff, inviting the black community

238
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,560
to once again come and suckle at the teat of it.

239
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,160
More and more, black people in the United States are finally unshackling themselves

240
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,840
from the victimhood narrative.

241
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:03,200
And this is good news for everyone, with the exception of those who demand that black people

242
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:10,160
remain subservient, meek, afraid, and constantly voting blue.

243
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,840
Hello my friends, I've got a very special announcement here at the end of the video.

244
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,320
Every year here in Canada, the Anime North Convention happens right around now.

245
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,960
In fact, it should be going on this very second.

246
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,760
Except for the fact that Anime North 2020 was cancelled because of the coronavirus.

247
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,920
In light of that, I figured now would be a good time to release some old Anime North

248
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,440
2019 footage we have saved up.

249
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,400
Dave and Dom, who work on the channel with me, went to Anime North 2019 last year.

250
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,880
They took the big expensive camera that I've got, shot a whole bunch of footage from the

251
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,600
convention, and then when they got back, uh, proceeded to lose it.

252
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,400
The footage, not the camera.

253
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,280
And I found the footage, so now I'm editing it and putting it up, over on my side channel,

254
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
the Devkit.

255
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,840
If you're bummed out about not being able to attend Anime North right now, or this kind

256
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,900
of content just sounds like something you might want to check out, click the video on

257
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,960
screen right now, that'll take you to it.

258
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,860
And hey, while you're at it, consider subbing to my side channels, they're also on the screen

259
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,860
too.

260
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,640
Alright chums, that about ends the PSA.

261
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,080
I'll see you tonight on my Twitch stream, and if not, I'll see you for tomorrow's video.

262
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,580
I love you.
