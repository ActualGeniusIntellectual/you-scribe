00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
Hey guys, Dev finally here with a new video.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,080
I know it's been nearly two months since the last full SFO video and I apologize for

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,080
that.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,240
Real life has kept me a bit run down recently.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,560
But I'm back and I'm going to be doing my best to maintain a regular schedule.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,860
While I was gone I was still working on and off on a handful of different videos.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,280
One of them was on net neutrality, because it's a topic that's returned to the forefront

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,580
of everyone's minds in the past week and will likely stay there for the next little

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,640
bit due to recent and ongoing happenings on the subject.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,440
However, I realized that the arguments I wanted to present in that video required that

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,040
I lay a rather large foundation on the topic of the pros and cons of capitalism, which

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,600
just so happened to be the focus of one of the other scripts I was working on during

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
the break.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,460
So, let's spend this time discussing the inner workings of capitalism, and I'll put

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,920
out a companion piece a few days after this video goes live on net neutrality, using this

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,960
video as a basis for it and feeding us into that conversation as best I can.

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,040
The premise I'm starting with is that capitalism is the single most successful, prosperous,

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,500
egalitarian, and robust economic system in human history.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,700
We need to examine not only how this can be so, but why it is so.

20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,520
And coming to this understanding is going to require us not only to examine the positives

21
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,660
and negatives of capitalism, but also the positives and negatives of a few of its main

22
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:18,880
historical competitors, namely socialism, communism, feudalism, fascism, and anarchism.

23
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,840
Now that's a lot to unpack, so please bear with me a bit.

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,720
Let's start with a few basic definitions, to set things up.

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,160
I'll pull these first two from Wikipedia, yes, I know, but for our purposes they will

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
do.

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,800
A social system can be reasonably defined as a patterned network of relationships constituting

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,640
a coherent whole that exists between individuals, groups, and institutions.

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,520
An individual may belong to multiple social systems at once.

30
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,560
Examples of social systems include nuclear family units, communities, cities, nations,

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,440
college campuses, corporations, and industries.

32
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,240
The organization and definition of groups within a social system depend on various shared

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,300
characteristics such as location, socioeconomic status, race, religion, societal function,

34
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,980
or other distinguishable features.

35
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:08,360
An economic system can be reasonably defined as a system of production, resource allocation,

36
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,720
and distribution of goods and services within a society or a given geographic area.

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,040
It includes the combination of the various institutions, agencies, entities, decision

38
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,420
making processes, and patterns of consumption that comprise the economic structure of a

39
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,300
given community.

40
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,340
As such, an economic system is a type of social system.

41
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,100
From these definitions we can glean that a social system is an area of human interpersonal

42
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,720
behavior that governs a specific part of society.

43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,800
An economic system is a type of social system that governs finance and production, just

44
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,200
like a legal system is a type of social system that governs law and order, and the same goes

45
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,820
for political systems, cultural systems, and so on.

46
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,680
This stuff becomes pretty obvious when you think about it.

47
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,600
We can also define our end goal for any given social system being in the service of humanity,

48
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,700
meaning a functioning social system must serve the needs of as many people as possible, with

49
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,300
a social system being considered more functional than its competitors if it is capable of serving

50
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,480
more people, serving the same number of people more efficiently, or serving the same number

51
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,680
of people with the same efficiency, but at a higher quality.

52
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,800
So quality, quantity, and efficiency.

53
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,620
Now I don't mean this in the strictest of utilitarian terms.

54
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,080
In my video titled When Is Political Violence Acceptable, I do spend some time picking apart

55
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
utilitarian ethics.

56
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,780
But let me give you the cliff notes here.

57
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,120
The idea of the greatest good for the greatest number of people sounds moral at a glance,

58
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,320
but there is no safeguard in place for the people that fall outside the bounds of the

59
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
greatest number.

60
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,520
This is what is commonly referred to as the tyranny of the majority.

61
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,880
If you want a simplistic example of the failure of utilitarian ethics, there is always bike

62
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
cuck.

63
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,520
In any case, this is not what I mean when I say that a social system needs to be in

64
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,920
the service of humanity.

65
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,180
While it's true that no social system can adequately protect the rights of, and provide

66
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,800
prosperity for, every single human being, it also cannot actively work to violate the

67
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,720
rights of, or inhibit the prosperity of people not within the system, at least not without

68
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,200
sufficient provocation.

69
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,560
Now there are some people who don't actually agree with me on this starting point.

70
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,840
A good example of those people would be the hardline multiculturalists.

71
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,760
When the claim is made that all cultures are basically the same, that they all have

72
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,280
the same value, and that a nation is not intrinsically tied to its national cultures but instead

73
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,680
to all cultures of the world, on an equal basis regardless of population demographics

74
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,000
or language or history or anything else that exists in reality, this is a rejection of

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,640
the idea that a social system must prioritize people within the system.

76
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,200
And there's not really an easy way to bridge the gap between these two points of view.

77
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,720
I mean, what's the point of having a social system if the bloody thing doesn't perform

78
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,480
its work primarily for the benefits of those invested in it?

79
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,640
The multicultural point of view is that any social system must equally accommodate all

80
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,360
people regardless of their participation in the system, and this idea is both impractical

81
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
and untenable.

82
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,200
I mean, you can't continuously withdraw from society more than you deposit, any more

83
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,800
than you can do so from a bank.

84
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,240
But then again, I don't think that these people have ever had to balance a budget.

85
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,840
So maybe I'm not so surprised that they think that piling on unrelenting burden is

86
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,680
how social systems should work.

87
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,800
But if we do accept the idea that a good social system must prioritize an in-group while still

88
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,080
not causing harm towards an out-group, that gives us a way to measure the relative effectiveness

89
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,560
of the six economic systems I listed off earlier.

90
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,960
Let's knock off some of the simple ones right away.

91
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,900
On anarchism.

92
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,160
Anarchism as an economic system, or really as any form of social system, is a complete

93
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
joke.

94
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,160
It doesn't work.

95
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,160
It never will.

96
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,880
I honestly don't think that the anarchists have any idea about the nature of humanity.

97
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,720
I can simply say, go read On the Social Contract, and despite the flaws in that book, this is

98
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,600
basically all the refutation anybody needs to throw all flavors of anarchism out the

99
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
window.

100
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,560
Anarchism describes a stateless society, where there is no government, no power structure,

101
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
and no nation.

102
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,080
And if this society ever manages to come to fruition, it will be promptly flattened by

103
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,520
the next society over that decides to actually unify into any type of fighting force, because

104
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,720
a stateless anarchist society will be entirely defenseless.

105
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,880
But that doesn't even matter, because when you even get just two human beings together,

106
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,600
there needs to be some form of self-mediation between them, some basis by which they recognize

107
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,180
each other on some level.

108
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,240
Even the most primitive, ass-backwards, uncontacted tribes have a power structure, a chief of

109
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,360
some kind directing the others, because as it turns out, organization and specialization

110
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,480
are good things for society, and an anarchist society by its very definition lacks those

111
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
virtues.

112
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,960
If you want to see anarchy in action, go watch The Thinkery's video on Slab City, and if

113
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,400
you want to get angry about it, realize that these people take food stamps from the US

114
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,680
government so they can live in houses made of scrap metal in the middle of the desert

115
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,840
and spend their time destroying other people's shit.

116
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,520
Anyway, it's time for judgement.

117
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,920
Remember our criteria, we can judge a social system if it provides for its in-group while

118
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,020
protecting the rights of its out-group in its given field, which is, in this case, finance

119
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,020
and production.

120
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,160
Does anarchism do this?

121
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,200
The answer is a resounding no.

122
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,720
Not only does it fail to do this, it fails to exist in any meaningful way.

123
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,840
And should an anarchist society ever actually exist, it will likely be the result of a massive

124
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,980
nuclear holocaust where entire continents are on fire and the few dozen remaining members

125
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,920
of humanity are spending their final moments eating each other because the Earth can no

126
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,500
longer support life.

127
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,720
On feudalism.

128
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,580
The case for feudalism as an economic system is another of the weaker ones on the list.

129
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,780
Put very simply, feudalism was a system where the noble class owned land within a kingdom

130
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,340
and peasants worked the land in exchange for the right to live on it and subsist off of

131
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,340
it.

132
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,460
Any excess value that peasantry managed to pull from the land would almost never actually

133
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,580
stay in the hands of the peasantry, but return to the nobles who owned the land.

134
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,060
Feudalism failed when the Black Plague hollowed out Europe, removing most of the serfs from

135
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,100
the equation altogether, as well as a shift in policy away from nobility maintaining their

136
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,740
own men-at-arms loyal to them and threw them to the crown and towards a more centralized

137
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,500
professional military.

138
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,820
Feudalism did manage to last until the mid-1800s in Russia, however, which would have a huge

139
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,060
impact on communism in that country, but that's for later.

140
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,560
So as an economic system, does feudalism provide for the largest number of people possible

141
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,820
while still not harming those outside of its system within the sphere of finance and economics?

142
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,180
The answer is again obviously no.

143
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,520
The out-group, the serfs, vastly outnumbered the in-group, the nobles, and they lived lives

144
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,540
of multi-generational indentured servitude with no possibility of personal freedom or

145
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,100
social advancement.

146
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,640
Feudalism was specifically designed to restrict the lives of its out-group as much as possible

147
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,420
in order to keep them working for the benefit of the in-group.

148
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,780
We can safely classify it as a failure, though this time at least it didn't require reducing

149
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,200
the planet to a ball of ash in order for it to exist.

150
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,680
The critique of fascism is a bit more complex than the previous two.

151
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,880
Fascism is not only an economic system, but also a political system that exists as a form

152
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
of hyper-nationalism.

153
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:35,080
Nationalism, as a social system, is not always a bad thing, but when it turns bad, it generally

154
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,680
morphs into some form of fascism.

155
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,940
Fascism prioritizes all-encompassing state control over every single social system.

156
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,680
The political system must be fascist, in order to maintain political power and direct the

157
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
nation.

158
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,240
The economic system must be fascist, in order to micromanage the economy for the betterment

159
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
of the state.

160
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,040
The cultural system must be fascist, in order to indoctrinate the people of the nation through

161
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
propaganda.

162
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,240
The military system must be fascist, as fascism values a state of total war, where the distinction

163
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,440
between military and civilian disappears, and all production, all people, all economics

164
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,440
and trade and art and everything else that exists is made to serve the war effort.

165
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,520
Fascism is ultimately totalitarian in nature because by its own definition it must control

166
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,720
and govern everything.

167
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,360
Oh, and for those of you calling the modern alt-right fascists or Nazis, you might want

168
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,240
to re-listen to the definition of fascism as a social system that I just gave you.

169
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,460
I very rarely agree with the alt-right, but they do not meet the definition of fascism,

170
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,780
on multiple criteria.

171
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,240
So let's talk fascist economics.

172
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,920
In Alfred Rocco's The Political Doctrine of Fascism, Rocco writes,

173
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,800
it considers the economic development, and especially the production of wealth, as an

174
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,480
eminently social concern, wealth being for society an essential element of power and

175
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
prosperity.

176
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,720
But fascism maintains that in the ordinary run of events economic liberty serves the

177
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,300
social purposes best, that it is profitable to entrust to individual initiative the task

178
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,580
of economic development both as to production and as to distribution, that in the economic

179
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,000
world individual ambition is the most effective means for obtaining the best social results

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,240
with the least effort.

181
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,240
Therefore on the question also of economic liberty the fascists differ fundamentally

182
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,400
from the liberals.

183
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,560
The liberals see in liberty a principle, the fascists accept it as a method.

184
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,680
By the liberals, freedom is recognized in the interest of the citizens.

185
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,280
The fascists grant freedom in the interest of the state.

186
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,600
In other terms, fascists make of the individual an economic instrument for the advancement

187
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,200
of society, an instrument which they use so long as it functions, in which they subordinate

188
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,560
when no longer serviceable.

189
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,720
In this guise, fascism solves the eternal problem of economic freedom and of state interference,

190
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,640
considering both as mere methods which may or may not be employed in accordance with

191
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,000
the social needs at the moment.

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,820
On first glance, this might sound pretty good, because hey, the fascists aren't stuck to

193
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,180
one specific economic policy, they're willing to swap things around based on what works

194
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,400
best for any given time.

195
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,240
But then you notice that they define what works best by what's best for the state,

196
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,520
and by the state they mean the government, the party.

197
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,680
And then you notice that individual rights are only respected while they're in alignment

198
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
with the state.

199
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,520
And then you realize that there's nothing built into fascist economics to stop the state

200
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,100
from turning on the individual when it suits them to do so.

201
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,120
Fascist economists believe that their pulling bits and pieces from capitalism and communism

202
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,420
meant that they represented a true third option to the problem of economics.

203
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,940
Unlike communists, they believed that the existence of social hierarchy was beneficial

204
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,940
to society.

205
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,360
But unlike capitalists, they believed that the government had a fundamental role to play

206
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,620
in managing the economic interactions between the various classes.

207
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,740
Like laissez-faire capitalists, they believed in social Darwinism within business, where

208
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,060
people were allowed to catastrophically fail or miraculously secede based on their own

209
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,060
merits.

210
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,420
But like socialists, they believed that a catastrophic failure in the private sector

211
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,740
set back not only the entrepreneur, but the state, and therefore the people of the nation.

212
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,560
And the entrepreneur was responsible to the collective in this regard.

213
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,560
In George Reisman's essay, Why Nazism was Socialism and Why Socialism is Totalitarian,

214
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,380
Reisman goes into great detail describing how fascist economics eventually snowballed

215
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,220
into the extreme restriction of all freedoms, not just economic but personal freedom.

216
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,740
Freedom of the press, freedom of expression, and so on.

217
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,980
It's a really interesting read, and I recommend you take a look at it, but the basic idea

218
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,100
is that Nazi Germany printed a whole bunch of excess money in order to finance its war

219
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,100
effort.

220
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,740
Dumping that much money into a free capitalist system caused hyperinflation, so in response,

221
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,100
the German government took control of most of the private businesses, and instituted

222
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,580
price controls and rationing of goods.

223
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,660
Because of the lack of freedom regarding what could be bought and sold, and at what price

224
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,360
and quantity, a large black market developed.

225
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,060
In response to the black market, the German government began issuing fines for anybody

226
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,160
caught dealing in an authorized business.

227
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,480
But the official state economy was so heavily controlled, and the black market was so profitable,

228
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,560
even excessively large fines could simply be absorbed into the huge profit margins as

229
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,920
a business expense.

230
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,960
So the German government had to set up a justice system in which the penalty for black market

231
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,940
trade was long-term incarceration or death, a secret network of spies to not only infiltrate

232
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,960
black markets but also intimidate uninvolved citizens into keeping their noses clean, and

233
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,920
a police force empowered with the authority to spend swift justice on the spot due to

234
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,840
a jury's obvious willingness to let somebody off easy for selling a couple of pounds of

235
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
meat.

236
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,720
And so, we now have the apparatus for the police state, which extends itself far beyond

237
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,720
economics but exists because excessive government control of an economy requires it to.

238
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,560
So, does fascism provide for the largest number of people possible within its in-group while

239
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,680
simultaneously not harming people within its out-group in the realm of finance and production?

240
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,700
Again, the answer is no, but not due to its non-existence like with anarchism, or its

241
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:38,160
extremely small in-group and the brutal repression of a massively large out-group like with feudalism.

242
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,560
In fact, the in-group of fascism is very well defined as the citizens of a nation.

243
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,280
The problem with fascism, as an economic system anyway, is not that it defines a large out-group

244
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,200
and then brutalizes them, but that it fails to provide for the economic well-being of

245
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,840
its large in-group.

246
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:58,200
Even though fascism's in-group is clearly defined, individuals within the in-group garner

247
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,420
minimal economic advantages due to their in-group membership.

248
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,600
Of course, fascism clearly does violate the rights of its well-defined minority out-groups,

249
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,160
but that has less to do with economics and more to do with other aspects of fascism.

250
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
On socialism.

251
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,280
Ah yes, socialism.

252
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,680
Communism's little brother, and often considered a stepping stone for a society moving from

253
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,660
capitalism to communism.

254
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,300
Socialism is defined primarily by social ownership of the means of production.

255
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,260
There are many different stripes of socialism, but they are united by the idea of social

256
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,260
ownership.

257
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,060
The means of production, for those of you who don't know, is socialist and communist

258
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,620
lingo for the factories, the farms, and the other locations, equipment, and methods used

259
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,300
to produce goods or services.

260
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,660
So, in a capitalist society, the owner of a factory would employ workers to run his

261
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,940
factory and produce the goods of the factory in exchange for a negotiated wage, which the

262
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,280
owner would then turn around and sell on the market.

263
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,320
The revenue generated from the sale of the goods would then be used to provide for the

264
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,280
wages of the workers, as well as pay the owner of the factory enough for him to live on in

265
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,720
exchange for not only the owner's ownership of the factory, but for his work in directing

266
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,640
and overseeing the production, the hiring and firing of workers, and the negotiation

267
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,360
of sale on the marketplace for his products.

268
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,040
Socialists believe that the setup is inherently unethical, that the means of production cannot

269
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,400
be privately owned by one person, but must be socially owned.

270
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,320
Well, what does social ownership entail?

271
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,160
Let's ask an actual socialist.

272
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,720
Yeah, I got into a shitty Twitter argument with this person a few months back.

273
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,440
I kept it up solely because I knew I was going to be using her stupidity in a video eventually.

274
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,600
I won't bore you with the details, you can go read it yourself if you've really gotten

275
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,800
bored with hitting your own dick with a hammer and want something a bit more painful.

276
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,600
Here's the gist of her argument.

277
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,260
Bosses at work don't actually do anything of value.

278
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,360
Workers do all the work, and management just gets fat off of it.

279
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,420
Therefore, any workplace must be socially owned, and must lack hierarchy.

280
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,120
The workers would all hold an equal ownership of the workplace, and a council of workers

281
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,280
would be elected to take the place of management.

282
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,080
The council would collectively decide every decision the workplace makes, with input from

283
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,320
the electorate of workers.

284
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,000
Oh, also, in this hypothetical dreamlike scenario, the state would not exist.

285
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,240
Yes, she was an anarcho-socialist, and that small townships and cities would have elected

286
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,320
councils to independently rule them from any federal body.

287
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,080
Which would effectively make them city-states, and would not be anarchy, but fine, whatever.

288
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,680
I don't know where to start here, this is so absolutely moronic.

289
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,440
I asked her if she believed it was inherently unethical for a boss to offer money in exchange

290
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,700
for a worker's work.

291
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,800
She said yes, because even if both the boss and the worker consent to the arrangement,

292
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,820
it's oppressive and exploitative, because it involves a power structure.

293
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,940
I asked her if it was possible for a worker to sell their partial ownership of a workplace,

294
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,200
and she said no, because money would not exist.

295
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,280
I asked her if having an elected council of workers would be too bureaucratic to function

296
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,720
during a crisis situation, where a single boss having to make a quick decision would

297
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,840
be more effective.

298
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,960
And she dodged the question.

299
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,260
I asked her if she knew that partial ownership by workers of a workplace already existed

300
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,520
in capitalism, in the form of some companies offering stock options for employees as part

301
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,360
of hiring, and she dodged the question.

302
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,320
I asked her how her rules would be enforced, which is when she mentioned those township

303
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,560
councils, and then I asked her if force would be used by these councils to prevent bosses

304
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,720
and workers willingly exchanging in barter for work simply beyond partially owning the

305
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,720
workplace, and she dodged the question.

306
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,280
But here's the most telling part of my whole exchange with her.

307
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,800
I said to her, let's pretend I'm running my own business.

308
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,120
With just me working in it.

309
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,400
If I wanted to bring on somebody to help me work, expanding my business into a two-person

310
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,080
enterprise, I would not be allowed to simply pay them out for their work, right?

311
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,820
I would have to offer this other person 50% ownership of my business?

312
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,400
She agreed, that's how it would work.

313
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,160
And then I asked her, well, what if I can't find anybody willing to work as hard as I

314
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,320
am on my business?

315
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,960
What if the business is my passion project, like say, my YouTube channel or my stream?

316
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,920
Why should anybody else deserve an equal share of ownership in the project if to me it's

317
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,640
a passion I will invest my all in, and to them it's simply a job?

318
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,240
Her reply was striking, and it gave me a hard look into the mind of a true socialist.

319
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,000
According to her, I didn't actually feel passionately or work hard on my business the

320
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,680
way I describe myself as doing.

321
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,760
According to her, all people inherently invest the same amounts of work into all things,

322
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,840
as long as they're not being oppressed by capitalism.

323
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,440
The idea that some people work harder than others, that some people have passion for

324
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,840
their projects, that some people may be considered to be exceptional, was simply a capitalist

325
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,840
myth.

326
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,840
Everybody's the same.

327
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,720
I was lying about my passion, and anyone I picked up off the street would do as a co-owner

328
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,840
of my enterprise, because I don't work harder or care more, I'm just a liar.

329
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,520
This is what socialism is, folks.

330
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,520
It does not believe in the true passion that humans can feel for their life's work.

331
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,000
It does not believe in a calling.

332
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,320
It does not believe that people are capable of becoming more than they currently are.

333
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,760
It attributes all differences in work ethic not to ability, talent, competence, education,

334
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,440
experience or passion, but simply due to the oppression present in the boss-worker dynamic.

335
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,280
And when that dynamic is removed, socialists believe all human beings to be unchangingly

336
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,960
equal in their capacity to work.

337
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,440
It does not believe in growth through effort, or successful entrepreneurship, or motivations

338
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,560
beyond simply subsisting.

339
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,240
Socialism talks about rights, but not responsibility.

340
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,800
It talks about alleviating suffering, but not about creating wonders.

341
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,040
It talks about survival, but nothing beyond that.

342
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,020
It talks about being alive, but not living a full life.

343
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,880
But like I said before, this woman was an anarcho-socialist.

344
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,040
Maybe all the problems come from the anarcho part of that equation.

345
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,000
So let's talk about state socialism.

346
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,760
Well, we kind of already did.

347
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,840
A lot of the arguments against fascist economics also apply to state socialism.

348
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,000
A contemporary example is Venezuela.

349
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,480
The Venezuelan government has seized approximately 30% of the nation's private enterprises.

350
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,260
But that 30% consists of almost all vital private infrastructure.

351
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,880
And just like what happened with Nazi Germany, rapid inflation has kicked in.

352
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,840
It's become a Twitter meme at this point, with how low the Venezuelan Bolivar has fallen.

353
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,840
I remember being astounded when the World of Warcraft in-game gold coin became worth

354
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,840
more than the Bolivar.

355
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,760
But that was months ago, and it's only gotten worse.

356
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,560
The Venezuelan government's response to this was to limit the amount of bolivars people

357
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,900
can withdraw from banks.

358
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,880
A massive black market is also beginning to spring up as well.

359
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,360
And if Venezuela doesn't change its course, we already know what's coming down the road.

360
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:00,040
Spies, secret police, suppression of freedoms of the people, foreign scapegoating and propaganda,

361
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,640
and transformation into a pure totalitarian state.

362
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,280
It's a catastrophic collapse of an otherwise viable country based on purely ideological

363
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
bullshit.

364
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,720
And a lot of Venezuelans are starving and dying because of it.

365
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,800
The Venezuelan government is committing human rights atrocities against its own people.

366
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,840
And I don't care how often they say that they're doing it to try and liberate the

367
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,840
working class.

368
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,620
Look at you, you fat fuck.

369
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,920
You've gained like 50 pounds during one of the worst famines in your country's history,

370
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,240
and you've caused it all.

371
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,440
And of course, the verified Twitterinos love to talk about how Venezuelan socialism isn't

372
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,680
real socialism, because it's state tyranny.

373
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,840
There's some understanding that socialism requires state tyranny to exist because the

374
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,120
owners of the means of production aren't going to give up those means unjustly unless

375
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,160
you impose massive force on them.

376
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,520
There's a Twitter verified account called the Official Socialist Party, which by the

377
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,100
way, shows you the real worthlessness of that blue checkmark.

378
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,080
But this account has some choice takes.

379
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,360
Like this, for instance.

380
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,000
There needs to be far more discussions and preparations taking place worldwide so that

381
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,640
there can be a smooth transition to genuine socialism.

382
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,520
Actual socialism has never existed anywhere.

383
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,200
It won't exist until global capitalism has ended.

384
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,320
Outdated economics get replaced by better ones.

385
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,840
A moneyless society with no ruling class is next.

386
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,020
You know, there's a lot of things that are just straight up wrong here.

387
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,400
But let me touch on one that I haven't mentioned yet in this video.

388
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,040
The claim that actual socialism will not exist while capitalism exists.

389
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
Why not?

390
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,100
Can't you go have your actual socialism somewhere while some other group of people somewhere

391
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,740
else not in contact with you has a capitalist system?

392
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,160
Why does socialism need to be all-encompassing, blanketing over every country and person before

393
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,240
it can be considered to be functional, or real?

394
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,520
Why does the mere existence of capitalism somewhere outside of the borders of socialism

395
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,920
cause socialism to fail spectacularly?

396
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,240
Is it because socialism necessitates a tyrannical government, and a tyranny requires foreign

397
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,600
scapegoats that its propaganda arm can use to distract the people from the tyranny they

398
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
live under?

399
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,360
Is it because if socialism actually existed everywhere, then there would be no more excuses

400
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,840
for the government to use for its failure, and it always, always fails?

401
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,880
Oh man, here's Jeremy Corbyn praising Hugo Chavez.

402
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,220
And Michael Moore, too.

403
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,400
Is there any reason why you chaps haven't decided to go and live in Venezuela since

404
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,660
it's such a paradise?

405
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,560
Or why you haven't socialized your own massive amounts of personal wealth and property if

406
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,980
the poor matter to you that much?

407
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,720
I mean, it's not like Venezuelans are resorting to eating their pets or anything.

408
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,660
Or that teenage girls are working as prostitutes to avoid going hungry.

409
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,900
That would be an awful state of affairs.

410
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,420
Though, considering the pedophilic state of Hollywood at the minute, there's a fair chance

411
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,020
that underage pussy on tap might actually motivate Michael Moore to move to Venezuela

412
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,020
after all.

413
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,860
Okay, okay, I know I'm just spending some time here taking the piss out of these idiots.

414
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,700
Let's actually discuss socialism seriously for a bit.

415
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,780
It's written in Trandran Kukkatha's article, The Cultural Contradictions of Socialism,

416
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,140
that socialism is by its very nature doomed to fail.

417
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,220
Socialist thinkers have usually presented social transformation as the solution to social

418
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,340
ills, since the source of those ills has been held to be the social and economic order in

419
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,900
which private interests and market relations are dominant.

420
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,940
Once market relations are transformed, they have assumed the way we would be open for

421
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,840
rule by the collective in the interest of the whole.

422
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,880
In these circumstances, there is little need to say anything about how political institutions

423
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,720
under socialism would check and control the exercise of power.

424
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,740
The problem of the abuse of power no longer needs to be considered.

425
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,840
It is liberal political theory that is focused on the problem of controlling the abuse of

426
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,500
power, since it always assumes that there will always be a danger of such abuse.

427
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,420
For in any society, there will always be particular interests trying to gain advantages for themselves.

428
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:14,480
Tyranny is always possible, but socialism assumes, or hopes, that such problems will

429
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,800
not arise, and so does not assume the need for political theory.

430
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,840
Indeed, were it to borrow from a theory of politics, such as the liberal theory, that

431
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,720
might help it address the problem of tyranny.

432
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,720
Yet in avoiding such borrowing, socialism has also avoided in addressing the problem

433
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,360
of how there can be a socialist order that is not simply a dictatorship by a socialist

434
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,440
political elite.

435
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,920
This is true of the socialisms described by almost every socialist thinker, even though

436
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,200
all of them envision the good socialist order not as a dictatorship, but as a society marked

437
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
by collective self-rule for the good of the whole.

438
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,300
In other words, socialism simply assumes that when capitalism is swept aside, the economic

439
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,740
system and the people within it will naturally settle into work or ownership of the means

440
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,900
of production, all on its own.

441
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,020
I know I'm sounding like a broken record here at this point, but it's pretty clear

442
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,700
that the socialists are ignorant regarding the nature of humanity.

443
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,220
Finally, we come to the judgement of socialism.

444
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,500
As an economic system, does socialism provide for a widely established in-group, while still

445
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,380
respecting the rights of a minority out-group, in the realm of finance and production?

446
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,180
Well, first of all, socialism lacks an out-group entirely.

447
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,820
You could make the argument that socialism's out-group are the bosses, or owners, or management

448
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,900
of a workplace.

449
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,860
But unlike communism, which simply wants to kill those people, socialism wants to demote

450
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,780
them to the position of co-owner.

451
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,440
So unlike anarchism, feudalism, or fascism, socialism wants to absorb as many people as

452
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,340
it can into its in-group, from its out-group, until the out-group no longer exists.

453
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,780
But does it provide for its in-group?

454
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,940
The only reasonable conclusion one can come to is no.

455
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:42,300
As an economic system, socialism does not provide for its in-group for several reasons.

456
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,300
One, it's too bogged down with its own bureaucracy to make expediated decisions.

457
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,860
Two, it provides no safeguards against its massive bureaucracy from becoming extremely

458
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,860
corrupt.

459
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:56,260
Three, it believes that the capability of becoming corrupt is some capitalist infestation,

460
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,180
and not something intrinsic to everybody.

461
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:03,080
And finally, four, just as it does not recognize that innate evil in human beings, it also

462
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,500
does not recognize the innate good in human beings, to strive for excellence.

463
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,140
Socialism fails not only as an economic system, but as any form of social system.

464
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,420
Non-communism.

465
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,180
The critique of communist economics will likely use many of the same criticisms I use to critique

466
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,460
socialist economics, because the two are closely related ideologies.

467
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,340
However, there are a few key differences that are worth discussion.

468
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,900
First, socialism advocates for worker co-ownership of the means of production.

469
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,500
Communism, on the other hand, advocates for communal ownership of the means of production.

470
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,340
Sounds similar, but is different.

471
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,500
In a socialized factory, 50 workers might each own one fiftieth of the factory.

472
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,580
In a communized factory, each worker owns the entire factory, and everybody's rights

473
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,940
overlap, creating community ownership.

474
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,820
Of course, in practice, both options often meant state ownership of the factory, due

475
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,100
to the state being the only legitimate representative of the people.

476
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,620
But fine, whatever, at least the theory is different.

477
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,660
Second, like I mentioned just a bit ago, socialism advocates for leveling the playing field by

478
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,220
forcing the bosses to have the same social standing as the workers, with everybody being

479
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,420
a co-owner of the means of production.

480
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,480
Communism, however, is entirely willing to just kill the bosses outright.

481
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,740
Of course, this is not directly stated in the Communist Manifesto, but with a bit of

482
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,820
reasoning, I think I can show you how this is indeed the case.

483
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,560
The communist theory of hierarchy revolves around the idea that all hierarchies within

484
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,340
a capitalist system are based in power, and only in power.

485
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,260
The great class struggle that Karl Marx describes is a power struggle between the proletariat

486
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,660
and the bourgeoisie, the haves and the have-nots.

487
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,540
And there is some legitimate truth to this.

488
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,940
The rampant, unregulated capitalism of Marx's time lacked a minimum wage or a maximum amount

489
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,660
of hours' work per day or week, it lacked workers' rights and protections, and it

490
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,340
had no problem with child labour.

491
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,220
It would not be uncommon for the factories of that era to employ ten-year-old boys to

492
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,740
work sixteen-hour days for a pittance, which is why so much of the Communist Manifesto

493
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:50,620
revolves around either factories or farms, with industrialization and serfdom both serving

494
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,040
to smother the working class, though using different methods.

495
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,500
This is also why Russia ultimately became the core nexus of communist activity, as Russian

496
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,540
feudalism had continued for several hundred years after Europe abandoned it.

497
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,220
So okay, it's reasonable to accept that hierarchies are based in power, there's

498
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,100
a lot of evidence for this to be the case.

499
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,940
But communism claims that all hierarchies are based in power without exception.

500
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,860
That if somebody got to the top of any given hierarchy, it was a power play.

501
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,180
Communism leaves no room for, say, a hierarchy of merit, where the people who exhibit the

502
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,680
greatest consistent skill rise to the top of the hierarchy based on that skill.

503
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,300
And well, you might consider me to be naive for even believing that hierarchies of merit

504
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,540
can exist in the first place, but no, no, I'm really not naive.

505
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:35,700
Of course, power plays can corrupt hierarchies of merit, but power can only corrupt a hierarchy

506
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,820
of merit so much before the hierarchy ceases to function entirely.

507
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,980
And really, can we reasonably say that the hierarchies of merit that exist within Western

508
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,340
capitalist democracies have been compromised to that degree?

509
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,340
I don't think we can.

510
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,780
I mean, look around you, you're likely watching this video on a computer right now,

511
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,620
which gets its power through the power grid.

512
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,940
And the data is being sent from your internet provider through the telecommunications grid.

513
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,000
If the hierarchies of merit that govern electricity and the internet in your area were so hopelessly

514
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,820
corrupted by incompetent people making power plays, would you still have power and internet

515
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,820
at all?

516
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,260
The fact that you're even able to hear my voice right now is testament to the hierarchies

517
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,380
of your society functioning at least somewhat on merit.

518
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,820
Complicated systems like power grids are falling apart all the time, and society is

519
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,680
full of workers who go out and patch it back together constantly, and we are so good at

520
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,180
doing this that we have things like water, power, heat, transportation, food, internet,

521
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,940
and so on almost all the time.

522
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:29,140
And hey guys, if you ever actually meet a communist, ask him if he had to get, say,

523
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:33,220
a dangerous operation performed, if he would shop around for the most competent surgeon

524
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,580
he could find within his budget.

525
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,680
And when he naturally says yes, tell him that the competent surgeon is only in his position

526
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,420
due to a hierarchy of power, and he would be better off going to the marginalized doctor

527
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,060
instead of the privileged one.

528
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:48,340
So, communism claims to want to upend those pesky hierarchies of power for the betterment

529
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,520
of the poor, downtrodden working class.

530
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,540
But in Soviet Russia, during the collectivization of all the farms, the most successful farmers

531
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,260
were completely wiped out, either through force or starvation, and this action led to

532
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,340
the starvation of millions of Ukrainians in the 1930s.

533
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,220
Just so you can have a taste of what this was like, I'm going to read an excerpt from

534
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,220
David Patra...

535
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,220
Patra...

536
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,220
Patrakarikos?

537
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,220
Fucking...

538
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:13,460
I'll read an excerpt from David's article, Why Stalin Starved Ukraine.

539
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,780
People crawled into wheat fields to eat ears of wheat before dropping dead.

540
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,480
They died from hunger in the act of eating.

541
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,460
Children collapsed and died during lessons.

542
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,300
A mother took the bread from her offspring to feed her husband.

543
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,340
She could, she said, always have more kids, but she could only ever have one husband.

544
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,780
A couple put their children in a deep hole and left them there in order to not watch

545
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,780
them die.

546
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,460
A father strangled his own children rather than watch them perish from hunger.

547
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,100
Communities that had once been kind and welcoming became mistrustful and violent.

548
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:44,940
Lynch mobs tortured people, and in the end, most horrifically of all, people began to

549
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,060
eat each other.

550
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,060
How could this have happened?

551
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,480
The moral side of communism purports to care for the well-being of the poor.

552
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,620
So what could be the rationale for the communist holocaust of the Ukrainian people?

553
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,900
Well, let me take you through it step by step.

554
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,700
There's a utopianism implicit in communist thought that goes a little something like

555
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,700
this.

556
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,720
If you could just get the damn bourgeoisie to stop oppressing the proletariat, the utopian

557
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,700
society would be ushered in and all people would live in paradise.

558
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,420
So the bourgeoisie is not only guilty of oppressing the proletariat, but is also guilty of preventing

559
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,140
the utopia from coming about.

560
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,900
And that's a pretty great rationalization for any sort of punishments communism may

561
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,220
afflict upon them.

562
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,700
And then you remember that the bourgeoisie also refers to people at the top of the hierarchies

563
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,700
of power.

564
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,680
And then you remember that communism operates under the principle that all hierarchies of

565
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,800
hierarchies of power, even when they're not.

566
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,520
And then you realize that, in Russia, the people at the top of, say, the hierarchy of

567
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,540
merit in regards to farming were extremely poor families that had just managed to pull

568
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,840
themselves up out of serfdom during the collapse of Russian feudalism due to them being the

569
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,960
most competent farmers in the nation.

570
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,660
And then communism, with its obsession with upending hierarchies, comes along and slaughters

571
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,480
all of those people, causing a widespread famine because there's no one left who knows

572
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,940
how to grow any food.

573
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,300
Is this a case of the communists truly loving the poor and having good intentions, but their

574
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,980
theory being so fundamentally flawed that it killed a lot of people?

575
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,740
No, I don't think so.

576
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,740
And this is where we finally come all the way back to communism's hidden desire to

577
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,040
kill all their bosses, when socialism simply wants to strip them of their status.

578
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,140
In 1937, George Orwell wrote the book The Road to Wigan Pier.

579
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,580
It's one of his lesser known works, up against titans like Animal Farm in 1984, but it's

580
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,080
still a very important book.

581
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,240
In it, Orwell describes his own real life travels through the slums, ghettos, and mining

582
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,180
towns of the UK, and paints a picture of desperate, grinding poverty.

583
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,400
And really, you'd have to be a sociopath to not feel something for the people he encountered

584
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,580
on his travels.

585
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:36,360
It made sense that, at least for a short time after those trips, Orwell himself began to

586
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,200
advocate for Marxist theories.

587
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,960
However, this advocacy was short lived.

588
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,800
And The Road to Wigan Pier ends with probably the most accurate view into the mind of a

589
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,960
communist, though he uses the term socialist.

590
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,720
From a thinker who briefly scared with the idea himself out of compassion for the poor,

591
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,020
but later rejected it.

592
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,020
Orwell wrote,

593
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,880
It may be said that even if the theoretical, book-trained socialist is not a working man

594
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,720
himself, at least he is actuated by a love of the working class.

595
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,800
He is endeavoring to shed his bourgeois status and fight on the side of the proletariat.

596
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,040
That obviously must be his motive.

597
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,480
But is it?

598
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,120
Sometimes I look at a socialist, the intellectual, tract-writing type of socialist.

599
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:19,780
With his pullover, his fuzzy hair, and his Marxist quotation, and wonder what the devil

600
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:24,380
his motive really is, it's often difficult to believe that it is a love of anybody, especially

601
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:28,300
of the working class, from whom he is of all people the furthest removed.

602
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,480
The underlying motive of many socialists, I believe, is simply a hypertrophied sense

603
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,480
of order.

604
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,920
The present state of affairs offends them not because it causes misery, still less because

605
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,280
it makes freedom impossible, but because it is untidy.

606
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,840
Poverty and, what is more, the habits of mind created by poverty, are something to

607
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,120
be abolished from above, by violence if necessary, perhaps even preferably by violence.

608
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,820
Hence the socialist's worship of great men, an appetite for dictatorships, fascist or

609
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,820
communist.

610
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,840
The truth is that, to many people calling themselves socialists, revolution does not

611
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,640
mean a movement of the masses whichwith they hope to associate themselves.

612
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,880
It means a set of reforms which we, the clever ones, are going to impose upon them, the lower

613
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,880
order.

614
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,160
On the other hand, it would be a mistake to regard the book-trained socialist as a

615
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,040
bloodless creature entirely incapable of emotion.

616
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,120
Though seldom giving much evidence of affection for the exploited, he is perfectly capable

617
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,440
of displaying a hatred, a sort of queer, theoretical hatred, against the exploiters.

618
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,760
Hence the grand old socialist sport of denouncing the bourgeoisie.

619
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,320
It is strange how easily almost any socialist writer can lash himself into frenzies of rage

620
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,640
against the class to which, by birth or adoption, he himself invariably belongs.

621
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,520
Now to anybody who spends any amount of time on the internet, and especially on Twitter,

622
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,600
and especially on the Twitter feeds of anybody with a verified blue checkmark, the person

623
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,880
Orwell describes has to sound extremely familiar, from fashion and fanaticism to interest and

624
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,880
ideas.

625
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,280
He describes a man-child, somebody who lives in the lap of luxury and has never felt true

626
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,920
suffering, somebody who dresses themselves up in a specific way to show their status

627
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,960
but spends so much time bad-mouthing that status.

628
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,560
He describes their fake rage against the oppressors, while not a peep comes from their mouths about

629
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,560
the oppressed.

630
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:12,120
These qualities all have their modern versions, from hipster game journalists, to rainbow

631
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,400
haired shetwinks, to verified twitterinos.

632
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,580
People who spend more time fake raging at whomever they perceive to be the latest oppressor

633
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,920
of the day for the benefit of their own social status than they do on actual activism for

634
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
the sake of the poor.

635
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,520
And it becomes very clear exactly what type of people communists, and socialists too,

636
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,800
are deep in their core.

637
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,280
They do not love the poor, they simply hate the rich.

638
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,780
So let's say a person like this comes along in states to use some rubbish like, hierarchies

639
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,380
of power function by privileging the powerful and marginalizing the powerless.

640
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,500
By the communists' own logic, the claim can be made that because communism privileges

641
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:53,040
hierarchies of power over hierarchies of merit, that under communism, merit is now the marginalized

642
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,040
quality.

643
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,560
I think this is why communists hate the rich, because even in the most opportunistic, unregulated

644
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,880
of capitalist societies, there will always be at least some people who manage to get

645
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,680
rich based off their own merits.

646
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,480
And that group will never ever contain the personality types that lead one to accept

647
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,260
the philosophy of communism.

648
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,920
From this point of view, the communist looks like a jealous, irrational child, determined

649
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,980
to tear down everything solely because he wasn't the one that built it.

650
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,640
But of course, the communists would never actually admit that to you.

651
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,720
They probably wouldn't even admit it to themselves.

652
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,320
If you were to ask the communist why he thought in these terms, his answer would be predictable.

653
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,340
I care about the poor, and therefore I am a good person.

654
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,720
And always in that order.

655
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,420
Not I am a good person and therefore I care about the poor, but I care about the poor

656
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,340
and therefore I am a good person.

657
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:40,660
Well then, if you were smart, or even better if you felt like trolling him, you would ask

658
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:45,400
the communist, well, when you say you're a good person, that's a position you're

659
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
privileging.

660
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,980
What about the ways in which you're an evil person?

661
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,020
Aren't those ways being marginalized?

662
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,560
And that sounds kind of funny, but there is truth to it.

663
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,820
We all have good and evil inside of us.

664
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,060
None of us are perfectly moral.

665
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,940
And it's actually important that we recognize this fact.

666
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,340
Because if we're cognizant of our capacity to hurt other people, then we can control

667
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,340
it.

668
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,340
We can make decisions with forethought.

669
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,820
But if a person were to truly believe that they were perfectly moral in everything, then

670
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,980
what reason would they have to be careful in their dealings with other people?

671
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,980
They wouldn't have one.

672
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,660
They would simply charge ahead, thinking that because they are perfectly moral, their innate

673
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,500
innocuous quality makes charging ahead perfectly safe.

674
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,720
And they'd leave a wake of destruction behind them, because they would be fool enough to

675
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,380
not admit their own failings.

676
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,460
In fact, let's say a perfectly moral person exists.

677
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,280
And somehow this person was a communist.

678
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,380
Best possible scenario.

679
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,500
And let's say we as a society give that person the political power needed to make

680
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,560
communism unfold in the real world.

681
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,700
And as communism unfolds, and begins to fail because that is what it will always do, and

682
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:46,300
people begin to die as a result of this, what would a perfectly moral communist do?

683
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,960
They would stop communism.

684
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
At least for a little while.

685
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,820
At least to ask the question, what's going wrong?

686
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,140
Why are people dying?

687
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,540
How do we fix this scenario?

688
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:58,860
They would not charge forward and kill tens of millions of people like every communist

689
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,780
leader in the history of humanity has done.

690
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:05,060
This is why you can never trust the moron that says true communism has never been tried,

691
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,140
or actual socialism has never existed.

692
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:11,300
The implication is that everyone who's tried it were all morally deficient, but that they,

693
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,380
the speaker, somehow have the inhuman morality to make communism work.

694
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,380
But they don't.

695
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:20,240
They're human, with failings, and would be corrupted by the absolute power necessary

696
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,460
to make communism work.

697
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,620
Just like you or I would.

698
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,520
But they think they wouldn't be corrupted.

699
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,780
And they would hold that belief right up to the revolution that finally deposes them and

700
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,280
puts them to the sword.

701
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,280
Such is the nature of the person that believes in communism.

702
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,860
This conversation has taken us far beyond the bounds of communism as an economic system,

703
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,340
and for that I apologize.

704
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,820
But the failings of communism are so supreme that they cannot be discussed in an economic

705
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,820
vacuum.

706
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:46,180
Suffice it to say, communism fails as an economic system for the same reasons that socialism

707
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,180
did.

708
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:51,220
It fails to provide for its massive in-group, it fails to account for political excess,

709
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,940
and it operates on the hatred of the rich rather than the love of the poor.

710
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,940
On capitalism.

711
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,860
Finally, we're here to talk about capitalism.

712
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,820
I have no clue how long this video is at this point.

713
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:05,540
It's probably pretty long, but hopefully I have done an interesting enough of a job

714
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,980
at laying a groundwork for why capitalism just works.

715
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,820
Now there's obviously parts of capitalism that don't just work.

716
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,780
I mentioned them earlier regarding child labour, a lack of workers' rights, and the horrible

717
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,180
conditions of the industrial-era factories.

718
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,260
Those horrors make me fully understand why Marx, and other thinkers of his time, sought

719
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,780
desperately for an alternative to capitalism.

720
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,940
But those conditions don't exist in functioning western capitalist democracies, at least not

721
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,740
often, and I don't think that any reasonable person nowadays would object to government

722
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,220
intervention if something like that started to come back.

723
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:40,900
In essence, a communist idea of what capitalism is is about 150 years out of date.

724
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,520
The factories that Marx railed against, they don't really exist anymore.

725
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,320
We have child labour laws now, and minimum wage laws, and maximum work laws.

726
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,880
All reasonable restrictions that prevent an immoral employer from working their employees

727
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,880
to death.

728
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,000
Remember when I said that we can judge an economic system to be successful based on

729
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
its providing for its in-group, while not harming its out-group?

730
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,900
Well, industrial-era capitalism did fail that test, but modern, moderate regulated capitalism

731
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,900
does not.

732
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,040
But why does capitalism work?

733
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,560
That's a bit more complicated.

734
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,360
Unlike the five other economic systems, capitalism accounts for personal liberty.

735
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,420
It allows all people, including the working class, to have the choice to do whatever they

736
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,260
like with their lives as long as they're able to do it themselves.

737
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:24,200
Of course, there are still poor people, and starving people, and homeless people in this

738
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,200
system.

739
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
Capitalism isn't perfect.

740
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,880
But within properly regulated capitalism, poor people at least have an opportunity to

741
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,120
get ahead in the game.

742
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,760
For example, things like student loans exist in capitalism, where a poor person can get

743
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,040
a loan to go to school in a useful field, get a well-paying job, and then repay their

744
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,100
loans and join the middle class.

745
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,300
This is possible even in the USA, where the capitalist system lacks some of the more reasonable

746
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,300
regulations.

747
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:51,000
It simply requires that a poor person go to school for something useful, and not feminist

748
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,660
dance therapy.

749
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:56,700
Capitalism is inherently a hierarchy of merit, where people will rise and fall within a marketplace

750
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,580
based on three factors.

751
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,020
One, how much effort they put into it.

752
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,580
Two, how much of that effort becomes victories.

753
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:07,560
And three, how much they are able to learn from the effort if that effort becomes defeats.

754
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,800
It is competitive, yes, and competition requires losers.

755
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,360
And some people may lose many, many times, for reasons that are truly not their fault.

756
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,760
Capitalism doesn't account for long streaks of bad luck, or well-meaning people who just

757
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,760
can't get a break.

758
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,200
But that is what reasonable regulation is for.

759
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,080
And just so we're clear, the reason hierarchies of merit exist in the first place is due to

760
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,020
a mathematical idea known as the Pareto Principle.

761
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:33,260
The principle states that, over a long period of time, roughly 80% of the effects of a given

762
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,520
situation come from roughly 20% of the causes.

763
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:41,720
Delafrido Pareto, the father of the principle, had a hobby of growing green peas, and noticed

764
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:46,440
that as he planted and replanted his crops over the years, approximately 80% of his harvest

765
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,520
came from only 20% of last year's peas, and the rest of the peas only produced just enough

766
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,940
to survive one more season, or nothing at all.

767
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:57,600
The Pareto Principle has been accurately applied to many situations across many species, from

768
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,600
plants and animals to human behaviour.

769
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,880
It's what the libertarians would refer to as the exceptional individual, where a small

770
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,480
class of hyper-capable people do the vast majority of society's work, and therefore

771
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,320
deserve to eat the majority of the rewards.

772
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,400
I don't entirely agree with the libertarian interpretation of the Pareto Principle.

773
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,400
But at the very least, I know that libertarians understand the principle better than the communists,

774
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,280
mainly because the communists would never be able to grow peas in the first place.

775
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,040
A great way to explain why western capitalist democracies function so well is to look at

776
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,520
both the needs of the individual and the needs of the state.

777
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,880
In, say, a communist system, the needs of the state directly oppose the needs of the

778
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,880
individual.

779
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,900
Where the individual need to benefit from his work, and the state need to collectivize

780
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,960
and redistribute all work, naturally oppose each other.

781
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,260
Using the same type of comparison, fascist economics allowed for success or failure based

782
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:47,120
on merit, but only made it a matter of social collective interest when failure occurred.

783
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:52,140
In other words, fascism did not reward success, but it did punish failure, for the reason

784
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:56,020
of sabotaging the state's economy and wasting the people's resources.

785
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,080
Western liberal capitalist democracies generally don't do this.

786
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,080
In fact, when they function correctly, they do the opposite.

787
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,360
We consider it a matter of social collective interest only when an economic endeavor succeeds.

788
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:10,680
In other words, we reward success, but we do not punish failure, because we understand

789
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,540
that failure in economics is punishment enough all on its own.

790
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:17,200
Just like with communism, fascism pits the economic forces of the state and the people

791
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,520
directly against each other.

792
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,080
But within capitalism, the needs of the individual and the needs of the state are aligned.

793
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,040
It's in the best interest of the individual to benefit from his work, for obvious reasons.

794
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,880
But it's also in the best interest of the state that the individual benefit from his

795
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,160
work, due to the wider benefits of trade with other individuals.

796
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,160
Still don't get it?

797
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,160
Here's a scenario that might help.

798
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,560
Let's say you have a carpenter, and he makes chairs.

799
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,440
The chairs he makes have a market value of $10 per chair.

800
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,040
He can sell them for $10.

801
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,200
And let's say you have a baker, and he bakes bread.

802
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,920
The loaves of bread he bakes have a market value of $10 per loaf of bread.

803
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,100
I know, we're just using hypothetical numbers here.

804
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,720
At first glance, it might seem like one loaf of bread is equal in value to one chair, and

805
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,600
to the marketplace at large, that's true.

806
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,360
But it's not true to the carpenter or the baker.

807
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:03,120
The carpenter has so many chairs, and he makes them so easily, they're not worth $10 to him

808
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,120
personally.

809
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,640
He's probably not going to go out and spend 10 of his own dollars on a chair when he can

810
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,640
make his own.

811
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,760
And the same goes for the baker.

812
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,560
His bread isn't worth $10 to him either.

813
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,120
So if the baker and the carpenter were to come together and decide to trade one loaf

814
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:21,320
of bread for one chair, even though both objects are worth the same amount of money, each person

815
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,200
values the other object more, because it's something they don't have and can't easily

816
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,400
make themselves.

817
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,600
It was a completely fair trade, $10 for $10, but the baker and the carpenter each got something

818
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,480
of higher value to themselves in the trading.

819
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,280
Everyone walks away happier, but more importantly, everyone walks away with more value than they

820
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,280
had before.

821
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,400
And by the way, that's the point of money, socialists.

822
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,060
Money has no power in itself.

823
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:48,120
It's simply a way of easily facilitating a barter system, where all individuals in a given

824
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:52,440
market value everyone else's goods more than their own, and are all willing to trade in

825
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,000
such a manner that everyone ends up with more personal value than what they started with.

826
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,760
Of course, there will be people that exploit the system, people who steal or sell fake

827
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,160
goods that aren't worth their price, and so on.

828
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,760
But the combination of an intelligent, well-educated population, market forces that allow quality

829
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,880
to naturally dominate over time, and in the most extreme cases, government regulation,

830
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,800
can adequately tackle the problem of economic exploitation.

831
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,600
This example also illustrates the value of specialization, a concept that the anarchists

832
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,880
can't seem to wrap their head around.

833
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,600
A carpenter can, over time, learn to build better quality chairs more quickly and cheaply

834
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,240
if he keeps practicing his craft.

835
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,480
A baker can learn to bake better quality bread for the same reason.

836
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,240
But if everyone had to learn every single skill, then nobody would produce anything

837
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,560
of exceptional quality.

838
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,280
Tell me, anarchists, how many part-time doctors does it take to cure cancer?

839
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,000
And I know that arguing from results is kind of a no-no, but let me indulge myself a little

840
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
bit here.

841
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,200
If capitalism is so flawed and weak and awful, why hasn't it been crushed yet?

842
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,520
Why do things held in community always fall apart in comparison to things held privately?

843
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,920
If these systems actually worked and didn't run counter to human nature, why do people

844
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,900
still not put their garbage in public garbage cans?

845
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,760
Why do parks need public works departments to regularly clean and maintain them?

846
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,900
Or on a larger scale, why didn't the Soviet Union outlast the United States?

847
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:10,320
Why has prosperity worldwide only improved under capitalism in the long term?

848
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,920
Why hasn't this stuff worked?

849
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,960
Oh, and the answer is not because it's never been tried.

850
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,640
It's clearly been tried.

851
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,300
You just don't like the results.

852
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,020
Believe it or not, sometimes the stated outcome on a theory does not line up with the actual

853
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,600
outcome of the practice.

854
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,760
In fact, if you are a communist, you should probably be happy that you live in a capitalist

855
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,280
society because if you really want to, you can get together your commune, you can go

856
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,960
off into the woods and live terrible, pathetic, dreary, collectivized lives.

857
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,560
Why don't more communists do this?

858
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,320
I presume it's because they want to drag the rest of us down with them.

859
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,460
And believe it or not, there's even a moral case for capitalism.

860
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:47,260
For all you moralists and spiritualists out there, aside from inheriting money, which

861
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:51,380
is its own separate conversation, or you finding a lucky twenty dollar bill on the sidewalk

862
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:55,880
or something, people generally only manage to get their hands on money by somehow contributing

863
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,880
to society.

864
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,180
You make something you sell or you go to a job where you perform valuable labor or you

865
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,220
donate to my Patreon.

866
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:06,200
At some point you have interacted in society in a meaningful way.

867
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,900
You have provided enough value to somebody else that somebody else was willing to pay

868
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,460
you money for that value.

869
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,420
So you take your money down to the grocery store and you ask the clerk there for some

870
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,420
food.

871
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,460
And the clerk asks you, well, did you contribute to society in a meaningful way today?

872
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,840
And you say, yes I did.

873
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,220
And the clerk says, well, how do I know?

874
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,500
How do I know you're not just lying?

875
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,940
And you say, well, I provided value to another person and he gave me this money in return.

876
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,580
And the clerk says, okay, that's great.

877
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,740
And then he takes your money and then you get your groceries.

878
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:35,180
That's the underlying conversation that happens when you go shopping for groceries.

879
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,660
And the money that you give the clerk eventually makes its way back to him in the form of wages

880
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,860
for his labor and the cycle continues.

881
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:45,540
In this instance, possession of money can be seen as proof of contribution to society,

882
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,180
which does have moral implications.

883
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,260
I know this isn't perfect because there are certainly jobs that should be getting paid

884
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,940
more for moral reasons that currently aren't.

885
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:53,940
But we're getting there.

886
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,000
No, really, we're getting there.

887
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,740
Capitalism is the reason we're living in the age of technology.

888
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,300
Capitalism is the reason there have been massive quality of life increases worldwide in the

889
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,900
past hundred years.

890
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,340
Capitalism is the reason that when the United Nations stated their intent to cut world poverty

891
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:11,420
in half by 2015, they managed to hit that mark in 2011.

892
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:15,580
Capitalism is not just the mindless pursuit of wealth until the entire system destroys

893
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,580
itself.

894
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,460
At least, not if it's properly regulated with the interest of the individual at heart.

895
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,140
Capitalism is a system where people can act freely in accordance with their own desires.

896
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:27,800
And if the fruits of the work they perform in the service of their desires has some worth

897
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,500
to their fellow man, capitalism allows them to survive and thrive off of those fruits.

898
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,660
But of course, capitalism isn't perfect either.

899
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,700
There's still a lot of people out there who fall through the cracks.

900
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,900
But a well-regulated, but not state-controlled capitalist economy, interfered with by the

901
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,820
government not for the benefit of the state or the collective, but for the benefit of

902
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:48,060
the individual, and only interfered with so that they may freely contribute value to one

903
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:52,180
another, will have the tools that we need not to help the poor, but to allow the poor

904
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,180
to help themselves.

905
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:57,900
And let me corrupt the Winston Churchill quote here a little bit for my own ends.

906
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:01,900
Capitalism is the worst form of economics, except for all those other forms that have

907
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:06,580
been tried from time to time.

908
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,620
Thank you guys for listening to this one.

909
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:12,340
As I'm currently recording this, the audio file is an hour and a half long.

910
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,840
It's going to be quite the editing job.

911
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,340
Thank you to everybody who supports my work on Patreon.

912
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:20,460
Thank you to everyone who tunes in, or even better, who subscribes to my Twitch stream,

913
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,560
which I do generally about four times a week.

914
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,540
Thanks to everyone who is in the Discord and being enthusiastic and asking me about where

915
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,540
the video is.

916
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,980
I know, it took me a long time.

917
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,820
I'm hoping to get this up on November 30th.

918
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,140
I'm going to work very hard to try to make that to be the case.

919
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:38,340
If you enjoyed the video, please consider subscribing because I do upload this content

920
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,340
at least semi-regularly.

921
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:44,020
And if you believe that in this capitalist system of ours, my passion project here has

922
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,900
provided you with enough value to warrant giving me some money for, please consider

923
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,340
heading over to patreon.com slash shortfatotaku.

924
00:48:51,340 --> 00:49:16,140
Thanks for listening, guys.

925
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:38,660
See you next time.
