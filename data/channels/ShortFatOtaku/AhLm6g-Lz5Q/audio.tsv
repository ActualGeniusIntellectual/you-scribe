0	2040	Hey guys, Dev finally here with a new video.
2040	6080	I know it's been nearly two months since the last full SFO video and I apologize for
6080	7080	that.
7080	9240	Real life has kept me a bit run down recently.
9240	12560	But I'm back and I'm going to be doing my best to maintain a regular schedule.
12560	16860	While I was gone I was still working on and off on a handful of different videos.
16860	20280	One of them was on net neutrality, because it's a topic that's returned to the forefront
20280	23580	of everyone's minds in the past week and will likely stay there for the next little
23580	26640	bit due to recent and ongoing happenings on the subject.
26640	30440	However, I realized that the arguments I wanted to present in that video required that
30440	35040	I lay a rather large foundation on the topic of the pros and cons of capitalism, which
35040	38600	just so happened to be the focus of one of the other scripts I was working on during
38600	39600	the break.
39600	43460	So, let's spend this time discussing the inner workings of capitalism, and I'll put
43460	47920	out a companion piece a few days after this video goes live on net neutrality, using this
47920	51960	video as a basis for it and feeding us into that conversation as best I can.
51960	57040	The premise I'm starting with is that capitalism is the single most successful, prosperous,
57040	60500	egalitarian, and robust economic system in human history.
60500	64700	We need to examine not only how this can be so, but why it is so.
64700	68520	And coming to this understanding is going to require us not only to examine the positives
68520	72660	and negatives of capitalism, but also the positives and negatives of a few of its main
72660	78880	historical competitors, namely socialism, communism, feudalism, fascism, and anarchism.
78880	81840	Now that's a lot to unpack, so please bear with me a bit.
81840	84720	Let's start with a few basic definitions, to set things up.
84720	89160	I'll pull these first two from Wikipedia, yes, I know, but for our purposes they will
89160	90160	do.
90160	94800	A social system can be reasonably defined as a patterned network of relationships constituting
94800	98640	a coherent whole that exists between individuals, groups, and institutions.
98640	102520	An individual may belong to multiple social systems at once.
102520	107560	Examples of social systems include nuclear family units, communities, cities, nations,
107560	110440	college campuses, corporations, and industries.
110440	115240	The organization and definition of groups within a social system depend on various shared
115240	121300	characteristics such as location, socioeconomic status, race, religion, societal function,
121300	122980	or other distinguishable features.
122980	128360	An economic system can be reasonably defined as a system of production, resource allocation,
128360	132720	and distribution of goods and services within a society or a given geographic area.
132720	138040	It includes the combination of the various institutions, agencies, entities, decision
138040	142420	making processes, and patterns of consumption that comprise the economic structure of a
142420	144300	given community.
144300	147340	As such, an economic system is a type of social system.
147340	151100	From these definitions we can glean that a social system is an area of human interpersonal
151100	153720	behavior that governs a specific part of society.
153720	157800	An economic system is a type of social system that governs finance and production, just
157800	162200	like a legal system is a type of social system that governs law and order, and the same goes
162200	164820	for political systems, cultural systems, and so on.
164820	166680	This stuff becomes pretty obvious when you think about it.
166680	172600	We can also define our end goal for any given social system being in the service of humanity,
172600	177700	meaning a functioning social system must serve the needs of as many people as possible, with
177700	182300	a social system being considered more functional than its competitors if it is capable of serving
182300	186480	more people, serving the same number of people more efficiently, or serving the same number
186480	189680	of people with the same efficiency, but at a higher quality.
189680	191800	So quality, quantity, and efficiency.
191800	194620	Now I don't mean this in the strictest of utilitarian terms.
194620	199080	In my video titled When Is Political Violence Acceptable, I do spend some time picking apart
199080	200080	utilitarian ethics.
200080	201780	But let me give you the cliff notes here.
201780	206120	The idea of the greatest good for the greatest number of people sounds moral at a glance,
206120	209320	but there is no safeguard in place for the people that fall outside the bounds of the
209320	210320	greatest number.
210320	213520	This is what is commonly referred to as the tyranny of the majority.
213520	217880	If you want a simplistic example of the failure of utilitarian ethics, there is always bike
217880	218880	cuck.
218880	222520	In any case, this is not what I mean when I say that a social system needs to be in
222520	223920	the service of humanity.
223920	228180	While it's true that no social system can adequately protect the rights of, and provide
228180	232800	prosperity for, every single human being, it also cannot actively work to violate the
232800	237720	rights of, or inhibit the prosperity of people not within the system, at least not without
237720	239200	sufficient provocation.
239200	242560	Now there are some people who don't actually agree with me on this starting point.
242560	245840	A good example of those people would be the hardline multiculturalists.
245840	248760	When the claim is made that all cultures are basically the same, that they all have
248760	253280	the same value, and that a nation is not intrinsically tied to its national cultures but instead
253280	257680	to all cultures of the world, on an equal basis regardless of population demographics
257680	262000	or language or history or anything else that exists in reality, this is a rejection of
262000	265640	the idea that a social system must prioritize people within the system.
265640	269200	And there's not really an easy way to bridge the gap between these two points of view.
269200	272720	I mean, what's the point of having a social system if the bloody thing doesn't perform
272720	275480	its work primarily for the benefits of those invested in it?
275480	279640	The multicultural point of view is that any social system must equally accommodate all
279640	284360	people regardless of their participation in the system, and this idea is both impractical
284360	285360	and untenable.
285360	289200	I mean, you can't continuously withdraw from society more than you deposit, any more
289200	290800	than you can do so from a bank.
290800	294240	But then again, I don't think that these people have ever had to balance a budget.
294240	297840	So maybe I'm not so surprised that they think that piling on unrelenting burden is
297840	299680	how social systems should work.
299680	304800	But if we do accept the idea that a good social system must prioritize an in-group while still
304800	309080	not causing harm towards an out-group, that gives us a way to measure the relative effectiveness
309080	311560	of the six economic systems I listed off earlier.
311560	313960	Let's knock off some of the simple ones right away.
313960	315900	On anarchism.
315900	320160	Anarchism as an economic system, or really as any form of social system, is a complete
320160	321160	joke.
321160	322160	It doesn't work.
322160	323160	It never will.
323160	325880	I honestly don't think that the anarchists have any idea about the nature of humanity.
325880	330720	I can simply say, go read On the Social Contract, and despite the flaws in that book, this is
330720	334600	basically all the refutation anybody needs to throw all flavors of anarchism out the
334600	335600	window.
335600	339560	Anarchism describes a stateless society, where there is no government, no power structure,
339560	340560	and no nation.
340560	344080	And if this society ever manages to come to fruition, it will be promptly flattened by
344080	348520	the next society over that decides to actually unify into any type of fighting force, because
348520	351720	a stateless anarchist society will be entirely defenseless.
351720	355880	But that doesn't even matter, because when you even get just two human beings together,
355880	360600	there needs to be some form of self-mediation between them, some basis by which they recognize
360600	362180	each other on some level.
362180	367240	Even the most primitive, ass-backwards, uncontacted tribes have a power structure, a chief of
367240	371360	some kind directing the others, because as it turns out, organization and specialization
371360	375480	are good things for society, and an anarchist society by its very definition lacks those
375480	376480	virtues.
376480	379960	If you want to see anarchy in action, go watch The Thinkery's video on Slab City, and if
379960	383400	you want to get angry about it, realize that these people take food stamps from the US
383400	386680	government so they can live in houses made of scrap metal in the middle of the desert
386680	388840	and spend their time destroying other people's shit.
388840	390520	Anyway, it's time for judgement.
390520	394920	Remember our criteria, we can judge a social system if it provides for its in-group while
394920	399020	protecting the rights of its out-group in its given field, which is, in this case, finance
399020	400020	and production.
400020	401160	Does anarchism do this?
401160	403200	The answer is a resounding no.
403200	406720	Not only does it fail to do this, it fails to exist in any meaningful way.
406720	410840	And should an anarchist society ever actually exist, it will likely be the result of a massive
410840	414980	nuclear holocaust where entire continents are on fire and the few dozen remaining members
414980	417920	of humanity are spending their final moments eating each other because the Earth can no
417920	419500	longer support life.
419500	420720	On feudalism.
420720	424580	The case for feudalism as an economic system is another of the weaker ones on the list.
424580	428780	Put very simply, feudalism was a system where the noble class owned land within a kingdom
428780	432340	and peasants worked the land in exchange for the right to live on it and subsist off of
432340	433340	it.
433340	436460	Any excess value that peasantry managed to pull from the land would almost never actually
436460	440580	stay in the hands of the peasantry, but return to the nobles who owned the land.
440580	444060	Feudalism failed when the Black Plague hollowed out Europe, removing most of the serfs from
444060	448100	the equation altogether, as well as a shift in policy away from nobility maintaining their
448100	452740	own men-at-arms loyal to them and threw them to the crown and towards a more centralized
452740	454500	professional military.
454500	458820	Feudalism did manage to last until the mid-1800s in Russia, however, which would have a huge
458820	462060	impact on communism in that country, but that's for later.
462060	466560	So as an economic system, does feudalism provide for the largest number of people possible
466560	470820	while still not harming those outside of its system within the sphere of finance and economics?
470820	473180	The answer is again obviously no.
473180	478520	The out-group, the serfs, vastly outnumbered the in-group, the nobles, and they lived lives
478520	482540	of multi-generational indentured servitude with no possibility of personal freedom or
482540	484100	social advancement.
484100	487640	Feudalism was specifically designed to restrict the lives of its out-group as much as possible
487640	490420	in order to keep them working for the benefit of the in-group.
490420	494780	We can safely classify it as a failure, though this time at least it didn't require reducing
494780	498200	the planet to a ball of ash in order for it to exist.
499200	503680	The critique of fascism is a bit more complex than the previous two.
503680	507880	Fascism is not only an economic system, but also a political system that exists as a form
507880	508880	of hyper-nationalism.
508880	515080	Nationalism, as a social system, is not always a bad thing, but when it turns bad, it generally
515080	517680	morphs into some form of fascism.
517680	521940	Fascism prioritizes all-encompassing state control over every single social system.
521940	525680	The political system must be fascist, in order to maintain political power and direct the
525680	526680	nation.
526680	530240	The economic system must be fascist, in order to micromanage the economy for the betterment
530240	531240	of the state.
531240	535040	The cultural system must be fascist, in order to indoctrinate the people of the nation through
535040	536040	propaganda.
536040	540240	The military system must be fascist, as fascism values a state of total war, where the distinction
540240	545440	between military and civilian disappears, and all production, all people, all economics
545440	550440	and trade and art and everything else that exists is made to serve the war effort.
550440	554520	Fascism is ultimately totalitarian in nature because by its own definition it must control
554520	555720	and govern everything.
555760	560360	Oh, and for those of you calling the modern alt-right fascists or Nazis, you might want
560360	564240	to re-listen to the definition of fascism as a social system that I just gave you.
564240	568460	I very rarely agree with the alt-right, but they do not meet the definition of fascism,
568460	569780	on multiple criteria.
569780	572240	So let's talk fascist economics.
572240	575920	In Alfred Rocco's The Political Doctrine of Fascism, Rocco writes,
585720	589800	it considers the economic development, and especially the production of wealth, as an
589800	594480	eminently social concern, wealth being for society an essential element of power and
594480	595480	prosperity.
595480	598720	But fascism maintains that in the ordinary run of events economic liberty serves the
598720	603300	social purposes best, that it is profitable to entrust to individual initiative the task
603300	607580	of economic development both as to production and as to distribution, that in the economic
607580	612000	world individual ambition is the most effective means for obtaining the best social results
612000	613240	with the least effort.
613240	617240	Therefore on the question also of economic liberty the fascists differ fundamentally
617240	618400	from the liberals.
618400	622560	The liberals see in liberty a principle, the fascists accept it as a method.
622560	625680	By the liberals, freedom is recognized in the interest of the citizens.
625680	628280	The fascists grant freedom in the interest of the state.
628280	632600	In other terms, fascists make of the individual an economic instrument for the advancement
632600	637200	of society, an instrument which they use so long as it functions, in which they subordinate
637200	638560	when no longer serviceable.
638560	643720	In this guise, fascism solves the eternal problem of economic freedom and of state interference,
643720	647640	considering both as mere methods which may or may not be employed in accordance with
647640	649000	the social needs at the moment.
649000	652820	On first glance, this might sound pretty good, because hey, the fascists aren't stuck to
652820	656180	one specific economic policy, they're willing to swap things around based on what works
656180	657400	best for any given time.
657400	661240	But then you notice that they define what works best by what's best for the state,
661240	663520	and by the state they mean the government, the party.
663520	666680	And then you notice that individual rights are only respected while they're in alignment
666680	667680	with the state.
667800	671520	And then you realize that there's nothing built into fascist economics to stop the state
671520	674100	from turning on the individual when it suits them to do so.
674100	678120	Fascist economists believe that their pulling bits and pieces from capitalism and communism
678120	681420	meant that they represented a true third option to the problem of economics.
681420	684940	Unlike communists, they believed that the existence of social hierarchy was beneficial
684940	685940	to society.
685940	689360	But unlike capitalists, they believed that the government had a fundamental role to play
689360	692620	in managing the economic interactions between the various classes.
692620	696740	Like laissez-faire capitalists, they believed in social Darwinism within business, where
696800	701060	people were allowed to catastrophically fail or miraculously secede based on their own
701060	702060	merits.
702060	705420	But like socialists, they believed that a catastrophic failure in the private sector
705420	709740	set back not only the entrepreneur, but the state, and therefore the people of the nation.
709740	712560	And the entrepreneur was responsible to the collective in this regard.
712560	717560	In George Reisman's essay, Why Nazism was Socialism and Why Socialism is Totalitarian,
717560	722380	Reisman goes into great detail describing how fascist economics eventually snowballed
722380	726220	into the extreme restriction of all freedoms, not just economic but personal freedom.
726220	728740	Freedom of the press, freedom of expression, and so on.
728740	731980	It's a really interesting read, and I recommend you take a look at it, but the basic idea
731980	736100	is that Nazi Germany printed a whole bunch of excess money in order to finance its war
736100	737100	effort.
737100	741740	Dumping that much money into a free capitalist system caused hyperinflation, so in response,
741740	745100	the German government took control of most of the private businesses, and instituted
745100	747580	price controls and rationing of goods.
747580	750660	Because of the lack of freedom regarding what could be bought and sold, and at what price
750660	753360	and quantity, a large black market developed.
753360	757060	In response to the black market, the German government began issuing fines for anybody
757060	759160	caught dealing in an authorized business.
759160	763480	But the official state economy was so heavily controlled, and the black market was so profitable,
763480	767560	even excessively large fines could simply be absorbed into the huge profit margins as
767560	768920	a business expense.
768920	772960	So the German government had to set up a justice system in which the penalty for black market
772960	777940	trade was long-term incarceration or death, a secret network of spies to not only infiltrate
777940	781960	black markets but also intimidate uninvolved citizens into keeping their noses clean, and
781960	785920	a police force empowered with the authority to spend swift justice on the spot due to
785920	789840	a jury's obvious willingness to let somebody off easy for selling a couple of pounds of
789840	790840	meat.
790840	794720	And so, we now have the apparatus for the police state, which extends itself far beyond
794720	799720	economics but exists because excessive government control of an economy requires it to.
799720	803560	So, does fascism provide for the largest number of people possible within its in-group while
803560	807680	simultaneously not harming people within its out-group in the realm of finance and production?
807680	812700	Again, the answer is no, but not due to its non-existence like with anarchism, or its
812700	818160	extremely small in-group and the brutal repression of a massively large out-group like with feudalism.
818160	822560	In fact, the in-group of fascism is very well defined as the citizens of a nation.
822560	827280	The problem with fascism, as an economic system anyway, is not that it defines a large out-group
827280	831200	and then brutalizes them, but that it fails to provide for the economic well-being of
831200	832840	its large in-group.
832840	838200	Even though fascism's in-group is clearly defined, individuals within the in-group garner
838200	841420	minimal economic advantages due to their in-group membership.
841420	846600	Of course, fascism clearly does violate the rights of its well-defined minority out-groups,
846600	851160	but that has less to do with economics and more to do with other aspects of fascism.
851160	852160	On socialism.
852160	854280	Ah yes, socialism.
854280	857680	Communism's little brother, and often considered a stepping stone for a society moving from
857680	859660	capitalism to communism.
859660	863300	Socialism is defined primarily by social ownership of the means of production.
863300	867260	There are many different stripes of socialism, but they are united by the idea of social
867260	868260	ownership.
868260	871060	The means of production, for those of you who don't know, is socialist and communist
871060	875620	lingo for the factories, the farms, and the other locations, equipment, and methods used
875620	877300	to produce goods or services.
877300	881660	So, in a capitalist society, the owner of a factory would employ workers to run his
881660	885940	factory and produce the goods of the factory in exchange for a negotiated wage, which the
885940	888280	owner would then turn around and sell on the market.
888280	891320	The revenue generated from the sale of the goods would then be used to provide for the
891320	895280	wages of the workers, as well as pay the owner of the factory enough for him to live on in
895280	899720	exchange for not only the owner's ownership of the factory, but for his work in directing
899720	903640	and overseeing the production, the hiring and firing of workers, and the negotiation
903640	906360	of sale on the marketplace for his products.
906360	910040	Socialists believe that the setup is inherently unethical, that the means of production cannot
910040	913400	be privately owned by one person, but must be socially owned.
913400	915320	Well, what does social ownership entail?
915320	917160	Let's ask an actual socialist.
917240	920720	Yeah, I got into a shitty Twitter argument with this person a few months back.
920720	924440	I kept it up solely because I knew I was going to be using her stupidity in a video eventually.
924440	927600	I won't bore you with the details, you can go read it yourself if you've really gotten
927600	930800	bored with hitting your own dick with a hammer and want something a bit more painful.
930800	932600	Here's the gist of her argument.
932600	935260	Bosses at work don't actually do anything of value.
935260	938360	Workers do all the work, and management just gets fat off of it.
938360	942420	Therefore, any workplace must be socially owned, and must lack hierarchy.
942420	946120	The workers would all hold an equal ownership of the workplace, and a council of workers
946120	948280	would be elected to take the place of management.
948280	952080	The council would collectively decide every decision the workplace makes, with input from
952080	953320	the electorate of workers.
953320	958000	Oh, also, in this hypothetical dreamlike scenario, the state would not exist.
958000	963240	Yes, she was an anarcho-socialist, and that small townships and cities would have elected
963240	966320	councils to independently rule them from any federal body.
966320	971080	Which would effectively make them city-states, and would not be anarchy, but fine, whatever.
971080	973680	I don't know where to start here, this is so absolutely moronic.
973680	977440	I asked her if she believed it was inherently unethical for a boss to offer money in exchange
977440	978700	for a worker's work.
978700	982800	She said yes, because even if both the boss and the worker consent to the arrangement,
982800	985820	it's oppressive and exploitative, because it involves a power structure.
985820	989940	I asked her if it was possible for a worker to sell their partial ownership of a workplace,
989940	992200	and she said no, because money would not exist.
992200	996280	I asked her if having an elected council of workers would be too bureaucratic to function
996280	999720	during a crisis situation, where a single boss having to make a quick decision would
999720	1000840	be more effective.
1000840	1001960	And she dodged the question.
1002000	1006260	I asked her if she knew that partial ownership by workers of a workplace already existed
1006260	1010520	in capitalism, in the form of some companies offering stock options for employees as part
1010520	1012360	of hiring, and she dodged the question.
1012360	1016320	I asked her how her rules would be enforced, which is when she mentioned those township
1016320	1020560	councils, and then I asked her if force would be used by these councils to prevent bosses
1020560	1024720	and workers willingly exchanging in barter for work simply beyond partially owning the
1024720	1026720	workplace, and she dodged the question.
1026720	1029280	But here's the most telling part of my whole exchange with her.
1029280	1031800	I said to her, let's pretend I'm running my own business.
1031800	1033120	With just me working in it.
1033120	1037400	If I wanted to bring on somebody to help me work, expanding my business into a two-person
1037400	1041080	enterprise, I would not be allowed to simply pay them out for their work, right?
1041080	1044820	I would have to offer this other person 50% ownership of my business?
1044820	1046400	She agreed, that's how it would work.
1046400	1050160	And then I asked her, well, what if I can't find anybody willing to work as hard as I
1050160	1051320	am on my business?
1051320	1055960	What if the business is my passion project, like say, my YouTube channel or my stream?
1055960	1059920	Why should anybody else deserve an equal share of ownership in the project if to me it's
1059920	1063640	a passion I will invest my all in, and to them it's simply a job?
1063640	1068240	Her reply was striking, and it gave me a hard look into the mind of a true socialist.
1068240	1072000	According to her, I didn't actually feel passionately or work hard on my business the
1072000	1073680	way I describe myself as doing.
1073680	1077760	According to her, all people inherently invest the same amounts of work into all things,
1077760	1079840	as long as they're not being oppressed by capitalism.
1079840	1083440	The idea that some people work harder than others, that some people have passion for
1083440	1087840	their projects, that some people may be considered to be exceptional, was simply a capitalist
1087840	1088840	myth.
1088840	1089840	Everybody's the same.
1089840	1093720	I was lying about my passion, and anyone I picked up off the street would do as a co-owner
1093720	1097840	of my enterprise, because I don't work harder or care more, I'm just a liar.
1097840	1099520	This is what socialism is, folks.
1099520	1103520	It does not believe in the true passion that humans can feel for their life's work.
1103520	1105000	It does not believe in a calling.
1105000	1108320	It does not believe that people are capable of becoming more than they currently are.
1108320	1113760	It attributes all differences in work ethic not to ability, talent, competence, education,
1113760	1118440	experience or passion, but simply due to the oppression present in the boss-worker dynamic.
1118440	1123280	And when that dynamic is removed, socialists believe all human beings to be unchangingly
1123280	1124960	equal in their capacity to work.
1124960	1129440	It does not believe in growth through effort, or successful entrepreneurship, or motivations
1129440	1131560	beyond simply subsisting.
1131560	1134240	Socialism talks about rights, but not responsibility.
1134240	1137800	It talks about alleviating suffering, but not about creating wonders.
1137800	1140040	It talks about survival, but nothing beyond that.
1140040	1143020	It talks about being alive, but not living a full life.
1143020	1145880	But like I said before, this woman was an anarcho-socialist.
1146000	1149040	Maybe all the problems come from the anarcho part of that equation.
1149040	1151000	So let's talk about state socialism.
1151000	1152760	Well, we kind of already did.
1152760	1156840	A lot of the arguments against fascist economics also apply to state socialism.
1156840	1159000	A contemporary example is Venezuela.
1159000	1163480	The Venezuelan government has seized approximately 30% of the nation's private enterprises.
1163480	1167260	But that 30% consists of almost all vital private infrastructure.
1167260	1170880	And just like what happened with Nazi Germany, rapid inflation has kicked in.
1170880	1174840	It's become a Twitter meme at this point, with how low the Venezuelan Bolivar has fallen.
1174840	1178840	I remember being astounded when the World of Warcraft in-game gold coin became worth
1178840	1179840	more than the Bolivar.
1179840	1182760	But that was months ago, and it's only gotten worse.
1182760	1186560	The Venezuelan government's response to this was to limit the amount of bolivars people
1186560	1187900	can withdraw from banks.
1187900	1190880	A massive black market is also beginning to spring up as well.
1190880	1194360	And if Venezuela doesn't change its course, we already know what's coming down the road.
1194360	1200040	Spies, secret police, suppression of freedoms of the people, foreign scapegoating and propaganda,
1200040	1202640	and transformation into a pure totalitarian state.
1202640	1207280	It's a catastrophic collapse of an otherwise viable country based on purely ideological
1207280	1208280	bullshit.
1208280	1210720	And a lot of Venezuelans are starving and dying because of it.
1210720	1213800	The Venezuelan government is committing human rights atrocities against its own people.
1213800	1216840	And I don't care how often they say that they're doing it to try and liberate the
1216840	1217840	working class.
1217840	1219620	Look at you, you fat fuck.
1219620	1222920	You've gained like 50 pounds during one of the worst famines in your country's history,
1222920	1224240	and you've caused it all.
1224240	1228440	And of course, the verified Twitterinos love to talk about how Venezuelan socialism isn't
1228440	1230680	real socialism, because it's state tyranny.
1230680	1233840	There's some understanding that socialism requires state tyranny to exist because the
1233840	1237120	owners of the means of production aren't going to give up those means unjustly unless
1237120	1239160	you impose massive force on them.
1239160	1242520	There's a Twitter verified account called the Official Socialist Party, which by the
1242520	1246100	way, shows you the real worthlessness of that blue checkmark.
1246100	1248080	But this account has some choice takes.
1248080	1249360	Like this, for instance.
1249360	1253000	There needs to be far more discussions and preparations taking place worldwide so that
1253000	1255640	there can be a smooth transition to genuine socialism.
1255640	1257520	Actual socialism has never existed anywhere.
1257520	1260200	It won't exist until global capitalism has ended.
1260240	1262320	Outdated economics get replaced by better ones.
1262320	1264840	A moneyless society with no ruling class is next.
1264840	1267020	You know, there's a lot of things that are just straight up wrong here.
1267020	1269400	But let me touch on one that I haven't mentioned yet in this video.
1269400	1273040	The claim that actual socialism will not exist while capitalism exists.
1273040	1274040	Why not?
1274040	1277100	Can't you go have your actual socialism somewhere while some other group of people somewhere
1277100	1279740	else not in contact with you has a capitalist system?
1279740	1284160	Why does socialism need to be all-encompassing, blanketing over every country and person before
1284160	1286240	it can be considered to be functional, or real?
1286240	1290520	Why does the mere existence of capitalism somewhere outside of the borders of socialism
1290520	1292920	cause socialism to fail spectacularly?
1292920	1297240	Is it because socialism necessitates a tyrannical government, and a tyranny requires foreign
1297240	1300600	scapegoats that its propaganda arm can use to distract the people from the tyranny they
1300600	1301600	live under?
1301600	1305360	Is it because if socialism actually existed everywhere, then there would be no more excuses
1305360	1308840	for the government to use for its failure, and it always, always fails?
1308840	1311880	Oh man, here's Jeremy Corbyn praising Hugo Chavez.
1311880	1313220	And Michael Moore, too.
1313220	1316400	Is there any reason why you chaps haven't decided to go and live in Venezuela since
1316400	1317660	it's such a paradise?
1317660	1321560	Or why you haven't socialized your own massive amounts of personal wealth and property if
1321560	1322980	the poor matter to you that much?
1322980	1326720	I mean, it's not like Venezuelans are resorting to eating their pets or anything.
1326720	1329660	Or that teenage girls are working as prostitutes to avoid going hungry.
1329660	1331900	That would be an awful state of affairs.
1331900	1335420	Though, considering the pedophilic state of Hollywood at the minute, there's a fair chance
1335420	1339020	that underage pussy on tap might actually motivate Michael Moore to move to Venezuela
1339020	1340020	after all.
1340020	1343860	Okay, okay, I know I'm just spending some time here taking the piss out of these idiots.
1343860	1346700	Let's actually discuss socialism seriously for a bit.
1346700	1350780	It's written in Trandran Kukkatha's article, The Cultural Contradictions of Socialism,
1350780	1354140	that socialism is by its very nature doomed to fail.
1354140	1357220	Socialist thinkers have usually presented social transformation as the solution to social
1357220	1361340	ills, since the source of those ills has been held to be the social and economic order in
1361340	1363900	which private interests and market relations are dominant.
1363900	1366940	Once market relations are transformed, they have assumed the way we would be open for
1366940	1368840	rule by the collective in the interest of the whole.
1368840	1372880	In these circumstances, there is little need to say anything about how political institutions
1372880	1375720	under socialism would check and control the exercise of power.
1375720	1378740	The problem of the abuse of power no longer needs to be considered.
1378740	1381840	It is liberal political theory that is focused on the problem of controlling the abuse of
1381840	1385500	power, since it always assumes that there will always be a danger of such abuse.
1385500	1389420	For in any society, there will always be particular interests trying to gain advantages for themselves.
1389420	1394480	Tyranny is always possible, but socialism assumes, or hopes, that such problems will
1394480	1397800	not arise, and so does not assume the need for political theory.
1397800	1401840	Indeed, were it to borrow from a theory of politics, such as the liberal theory, that
1401840	1403720	might help it address the problem of tyranny.
1403720	1407720	Yet in avoiding such borrowing, socialism has also avoided in addressing the problem
1407720	1411360	of how there can be a socialist order that is not simply a dictatorship by a socialist
1411360	1412440	political elite.
1412440	1415920	This is true of the socialisms described by almost every socialist thinker, even though
1415920	1420200	all of them envision the good socialist order not as a dictatorship, but as a society marked
1420200	1422200	by collective self-rule for the good of the whole.
1422200	1426300	In other words, socialism simply assumes that when capitalism is swept aside, the economic
1426300	1429740	system and the people within it will naturally settle into work or ownership of the means
1429740	1430900	of production, all on its own.
1430900	1434020	I know I'm sounding like a broken record here at this point, but it's pretty clear
1434020	1436700	that the socialists are ignorant regarding the nature of humanity.
1436700	1439220	Finally, we come to the judgement of socialism.
1439220	1443500	As an economic system, does socialism provide for a widely established in-group, while still
1443500	1447380	respecting the rights of a minority out-group, in the realm of finance and production?
1447380	1451180	Well, first of all, socialism lacks an out-group entirely.
1451180	1455820	You could make the argument that socialism's out-group are the bosses, or owners, or management
1455820	1456900	of a workplace.
1456900	1460860	But unlike communism, which simply wants to kill those people, socialism wants to demote
1460860	1462780	them to the position of co-owner.
1462780	1467440	So unlike anarchism, feudalism, or fascism, socialism wants to absorb as many people as
1467440	1472340	it can into its in-group, from its out-group, until the out-group no longer exists.
1472340	1474780	But does it provide for its in-group?
1474780	1477940	The only reasonable conclusion one can come to is no.
1477940	1482300	As an economic system, socialism does not provide for its in-group for several reasons.
1482300	1486300	One, it's too bogged down with its own bureaucracy to make expediated decisions.
1486300	1490860	Two, it provides no safeguards against its massive bureaucracy from becoming extremely
1490860	1491860	corrupt.
1491860	1496260	Three, it believes that the capability of becoming corrupt is some capitalist infestation,
1496260	1498180	and not something intrinsic to everybody.
1498180	1503080	And finally, four, just as it does not recognize that innate evil in human beings, it also
1503080	1507500	does not recognize the innate good in human beings, to strive for excellence.
1507500	1512140	Socialism fails not only as an economic system, but as any form of social system.
1512140	1513420	Non-communism.
1513420	1517180	The critique of communist economics will likely use many of the same criticisms I use to critique
1517180	1520460	socialist economics, because the two are closely related ideologies.
1520460	1523340	However, there are a few key differences that are worth discussion.
1523340	1526900	First, socialism advocates for worker co-ownership of the means of production.
1526900	1530500	Communism, on the other hand, advocates for communal ownership of the means of production.
1530500	1532340	Sounds similar, but is different.
1532340	1536500	In a socialized factory, 50 workers might each own one fiftieth of the factory.
1536500	1540580	In a communized factory, each worker owns the entire factory, and everybody's rights
1540580	1542940	overlap, creating community ownership.
1542940	1546820	Of course, in practice, both options often meant state ownership of the factory, due
1546820	1550100	to the state being the only legitimate representative of the people.
1550100	1552620	But fine, whatever, at least the theory is different.
1552620	1556660	Second, like I mentioned just a bit ago, socialism advocates for leveling the playing field by
1556660	1560220	forcing the bosses to have the same social standing as the workers, with everybody being
1560220	1562420	a co-owner of the means of production.
1562420	1565480	Communism, however, is entirely willing to just kill the bosses outright.
1565480	1568740	Of course, this is not directly stated in the Communist Manifesto, but with a bit of
1568740	1571820	reasoning, I think I can show you how this is indeed the case.
1571820	1575560	The communist theory of hierarchy revolves around the idea that all hierarchies within
1575560	1579340	a capitalist system are based in power, and only in power.
1579340	1583260	The great class struggle that Karl Marx describes is a power struggle between the proletariat
1583260	1586660	and the bourgeoisie, the haves and the have-nots.
1586660	1588540	And there is some legitimate truth to this.
1588540	1592940	The rampant, unregulated capitalism of Marx's time lacked a minimum wage or a maximum amount
1592940	1596660	of hours' work per day or week, it lacked workers' rights and protections, and it
1596660	1598340	had no problem with child labour.
1598340	1602220	It would not be uncommon for the factories of that era to employ ten-year-old boys to
1602220	1605740	work sixteen-hour days for a pittance, which is why so much of the Communist Manifesto
1605740	1610620	revolves around either factories or farms, with industrialization and serfdom both serving
1610620	1614040	to smother the working class, though using different methods.
1614040	1618500	This is also why Russia ultimately became the core nexus of communist activity, as Russian
1618500	1622540	feudalism had continued for several hundred years after Europe abandoned it.
1622540	1626220	So okay, it's reasonable to accept that hierarchies are based in power, there's
1626220	1628100	a lot of evidence for this to be the case.
1628100	1631940	But communism claims that all hierarchies are based in power without exception.
1631940	1635860	That if somebody got to the top of any given hierarchy, it was a power play.
1635860	1640180	Communism leaves no room for, say, a hierarchy of merit, where the people who exhibit the
1640180	1643680	greatest consistent skill rise to the top of the hierarchy based on that skill.
1643680	1647300	And well, you might consider me to be naive for even believing that hierarchies of merit
1647300	1651540	can exist in the first place, but no, no, I'm really not naive.
1651540	1655700	Of course, power plays can corrupt hierarchies of merit, but power can only corrupt a hierarchy
1655700	1658820	of merit so much before the hierarchy ceases to function entirely.
1658820	1662980	And really, can we reasonably say that the hierarchies of merit that exist within Western
1662980	1666340	capitalist democracies have been compromised to that degree?
1666340	1667340	I don't think we can.
1667340	1670780	I mean, look around you, you're likely watching this video on a computer right now,
1670780	1672620	which gets its power through the power grid.
1672620	1675940	And the data is being sent from your internet provider through the telecommunications grid.
1675940	1680000	If the hierarchies of merit that govern electricity and the internet in your area were so hopelessly
1680000	1683820	corrupted by incompetent people making power plays, would you still have power and internet
1683820	1684820	at all?
1684940	1688260	The fact that you're even able to hear my voice right now is testament to the hierarchies
1688260	1691380	of your society functioning at least somewhat on merit.
1691380	1694820	Complicated systems like power grids are falling apart all the time, and society is
1694820	1698680	full of workers who go out and patch it back together constantly, and we are so good at
1698680	1703180	doing this that we have things like water, power, heat, transportation, food, internet,
1703180	1704940	and so on almost all the time.
1704940	1709140	And hey guys, if you ever actually meet a communist, ask him if he had to get, say,
1709140	1713220	a dangerous operation performed, if he would shop around for the most competent surgeon
1713220	1714580	he could find within his budget.
1714580	1718680	And when he naturally says yes, tell him that the competent surgeon is only in his position
1718680	1722420	due to a hierarchy of power, and he would be better off going to the marginalized doctor
1722420	1724060	instead of the privileged one.
1724060	1728340	So, communism claims to want to upend those pesky hierarchies of power for the betterment
1728340	1730520	of the poor, downtrodden working class.
1730520	1734540	But in Soviet Russia, during the collectivization of all the farms, the most successful farmers
1734540	1738260	were completely wiped out, either through force or starvation, and this action led to
1738260	1741340	the starvation of millions of Ukrainians in the 1930s.
1741340	1744220	Just so you can have a taste of what this was like, I'm going to read an excerpt from
1744220	1745220	David Patra...
1745220	1746220	Patra...
1746220	1747220	Patrakarikos?
1747220	1748220	Fucking...
1748220	1753460	I'll read an excerpt from David's article, Why Stalin Starved Ukraine.
1753460	1756780	People crawled into wheat fields to eat ears of wheat before dropping dead.
1756780	1759480	They died from hunger in the act of eating.
1759480	1761460	Children collapsed and died during lessons.
1761460	1764300	A mother took the bread from her offspring to feed her husband.
1764300	1768340	She could, she said, always have more kids, but she could only ever have one husband.
1768340	1771780	A couple put their children in a deep hole and left them there in order to not watch
1771780	1772780	them die.
1772780	1776460	A father strangled his own children rather than watch them perish from hunger.
1776460	1780100	Communities that had once been kind and welcoming became mistrustful and violent.
1780100	1784940	Lynch mobs tortured people, and in the end, most horrifically of all, people began to
1784940	1786060	eat each other.
1786060	1787060	How could this have happened?
1787060	1790480	The moral side of communism purports to care for the well-being of the poor.
1790480	1793620	So what could be the rationale for the communist holocaust of the Ukrainian people?
1793620	1795900	Well, let me take you through it step by step.
1795900	1799700	There's a utopianism implicit in communist thought that goes a little something like
1799700	1800700	this.
1800700	1803720	If you could just get the damn bourgeoisie to stop oppressing the proletariat, the utopian
1803720	1806700	society would be ushered in and all people would live in paradise.
1806700	1811420	So the bourgeoisie is not only guilty of oppressing the proletariat, but is also guilty of preventing
1811420	1813140	the utopia from coming about.
1813140	1816900	And that's a pretty great rationalization for any sort of punishments communism may
1816900	1818220	afflict upon them.
1818220	1821700	And then you remember that the bourgeoisie also refers to people at the top of the hierarchies
1821700	1822700	of power.
1822700	1825680	And then you remember that communism operates under the principle that all hierarchies of
1825720	1827800	hierarchies of power, even when they're not.
1827800	1831520	And then you realize that, in Russia, the people at the top of, say, the hierarchy of
1831520	1835540	merit in regards to farming were extremely poor families that had just managed to pull
1835540	1839840	themselves up out of serfdom during the collapse of Russian feudalism due to them being the
1839840	1841960	most competent farmers in the nation.
1841960	1846660	And then communism, with its obsession with upending hierarchies, comes along and slaughters
1846660	1850480	all of those people, causing a widespread famine because there's no one left who knows
1850480	1851940	how to grow any food.
1851940	1856300	Is this a case of the communists truly loving the poor and having good intentions, but their
1856300	1859980	theory being so fundamentally flawed that it killed a lot of people?
1859980	1861740	No, I don't think so.
1861740	1864740	And this is where we finally come all the way back to communism's hidden desire to
1864740	1869040	kill all their bosses, when socialism simply wants to strip them of their status.
1869040	1873140	In 1937, George Orwell wrote the book The Road to Wigan Pier.
1873140	1877580	It's one of his lesser known works, up against titans like Animal Farm in 1984, but it's
1877580	1879080	still a very important book.
1879080	1883240	In it, Orwell describes his own real life travels through the slums, ghettos, and mining
1883240	1887180	towns of the UK, and paints a picture of desperate, grinding poverty.
1887180	1890400	And really, you'd have to be a sociopath to not feel something for the people he encountered
1890400	1891580	on his travels.
1891580	1896360	It made sense that, at least for a short time after those trips, Orwell himself began to
1896360	1898200	advocate for Marxist theories.
1898200	1900960	However, this advocacy was short lived.
1900960	1904800	And The Road to Wigan Pier ends with probably the most accurate view into the mind of a
1904800	1906960	communist, though he uses the term socialist.
1906960	1910720	From a thinker who briefly scared with the idea himself out of compassion for the poor,
1910720	1912020	but later rejected it.
1912020	1913020	Orwell wrote,
1913020	1916880	It may be said that even if the theoretical, book-trained socialist is not a working man
1916880	1920720	himself, at least he is actuated by a love of the working class.
1920720	1925800	He is endeavoring to shed his bourgeois status and fight on the side of the proletariat.
1925800	1928040	That obviously must be his motive.
1928040	1929480	But is it?
1929480	1934120	Sometimes I look at a socialist, the intellectual, tract-writing type of socialist.
1934120	1939780	With his pullover, his fuzzy hair, and his Marxist quotation, and wonder what the devil
1939780	1944380	his motive really is, it's often difficult to believe that it is a love of anybody, especially
1944380	1948300	of the working class, from whom he is of all people the furthest removed.
1948300	1952480	The underlying motive of many socialists, I believe, is simply a hypertrophied sense
1952480	1953480	of order.
1953480	1957920	The present state of affairs offends them not because it causes misery, still less because
1957920	1961280	it makes freedom impossible, but because it is untidy.
1961280	1964840	Poverty and, what is more, the habits of mind created by poverty, are something to
1964840	1970120	be abolished from above, by violence if necessary, perhaps even preferably by violence.
1970120	1974820	Hence the socialist's worship of great men, an appetite for dictatorships, fascist or
1974820	1975820	communist.
1975820	1978840	The truth is that, to many people calling themselves socialists, revolution does not
1978840	1982640	mean a movement of the masses whichwith they hope to associate themselves.
1982640	1987880	It means a set of reforms which we, the clever ones, are going to impose upon them, the lower
1987880	1988880	order.
1988880	1992160	On the other hand, it would be a mistake to regard the book-trained socialist as a
1992160	1995040	bloodless creature entirely incapable of emotion.
1995040	1999120	Though seldom giving much evidence of affection for the exploited, he is perfectly capable
1999120	2004440	of displaying a hatred, a sort of queer, theoretical hatred, against the exploiters.
2004440	2007760	Hence the grand old socialist sport of denouncing the bourgeoisie.
2007760	2012320	It is strange how easily almost any socialist writer can lash himself into frenzies of rage
2012320	2017640	against the class to which, by birth or adoption, he himself invariably belongs.
2017640	2021520	Now to anybody who spends any amount of time on the internet, and especially on Twitter,
2021520	2025600	and especially on the Twitter feeds of anybody with a verified blue checkmark, the person
2025600	2030880	Orwell describes has to sound extremely familiar, from fashion and fanaticism to interest and
2030880	2031880	ideas.
2031880	2035280	He describes a man-child, somebody who lives in the lap of luxury and has never felt true
2035280	2038920	suffering, somebody who dresses themselves up in a specific way to show their status
2038920	2041960	but spends so much time bad-mouthing that status.
2041960	2046560	He describes their fake rage against the oppressors, while not a peep comes from their mouths about
2046560	2047560	the oppressed.
2047560	2052120	These qualities all have their modern versions, from hipster game journalists, to rainbow
2052120	2055400	haired shetwinks, to verified twitterinos.
2055400	2059580	People who spend more time fake raging at whomever they perceive to be the latest oppressor
2059580	2063920	of the day for the benefit of their own social status than they do on actual activism for
2063920	2064920	the sake of the poor.
2064920	2069520	And it becomes very clear exactly what type of people communists, and socialists too,
2069520	2070800	are deep in their core.
2070800	2074280	They do not love the poor, they simply hate the rich.
2074280	2078780	So let's say a person like this comes along in states to use some rubbish like, hierarchies
2078780	2082380	of power function by privileging the powerful and marginalizing the powerless.
2082380	2086500	By the communists' own logic, the claim can be made that because communism privileges
2086500	2093040	hierarchies of power over hierarchies of merit, that under communism, merit is now the marginalized
2093040	2094040	quality.
2094040	2098560	I think this is why communists hate the rich, because even in the most opportunistic, unregulated
2098560	2102880	of capitalist societies, there will always be at least some people who manage to get
2102880	2104680	rich based off their own merits.
2104680	2108480	And that group will never ever contain the personality types that lead one to accept
2108480	2110260	the philosophy of communism.
2110260	2113920	From this point of view, the communist looks like a jealous, irrational child, determined
2113920	2116980	to tear down everything solely because he wasn't the one that built it.
2116980	2119640	But of course, the communists would never actually admit that to you.
2119640	2121720	They probably wouldn't even admit it to themselves.
2121720	2126320	If you were to ask the communist why he thought in these terms, his answer would be predictable.
2126320	2129340	I care about the poor, and therefore I am a good person.
2129340	2130720	And always in that order.
2130720	2134420	Not I am a good person and therefore I care about the poor, but I care about the poor
2134420	2136340	and therefore I am a good person.
2136340	2140660	Well then, if you were smart, or even better if you felt like trolling him, you would ask
2140660	2145400	the communist, well, when you say you're a good person, that's a position you're
2145400	2146400	privileging.
2146400	2147980	What about the ways in which you're an evil person?
2147980	2150020	Aren't those ways being marginalized?
2150020	2152560	And that sounds kind of funny, but there is truth to it.
2152560	2154820	We all have good and evil inside of us.
2154820	2156060	None of us are perfectly moral.
2156060	2158940	And it's actually important that we recognize this fact.
2158940	2162340	Because if we're cognizant of our capacity to hurt other people, then we can control
2162340	2163340	it.
2163340	2164340	We can make decisions with forethought.
2164340	2167820	But if a person were to truly believe that they were perfectly moral in everything, then
2167820	2170980	what reason would they have to be careful in their dealings with other people?
2170980	2171980	They wouldn't have one.
2171980	2175660	They would simply charge ahead, thinking that because they are perfectly moral, their innate
2175660	2178500	innocuous quality makes charging ahead perfectly safe.
2178500	2181720	And they'd leave a wake of destruction behind them, because they would be fool enough to
2181720	2183380	not admit their own failings.
2183380	2187460	In fact, let's say a perfectly moral person exists.
2187460	2190280	And somehow this person was a communist.
2190280	2191380	Best possible scenario.
2191380	2195500	And let's say we as a society give that person the political power needed to make
2195500	2197560	communism unfold in the real world.
2197560	2201700	And as communism unfolds, and begins to fail because that is what it will always do, and
2201700	2206300	people begin to die as a result of this, what would a perfectly moral communist do?
2206300	2207960	They would stop communism.
2207960	2208960	At least for a little while.
2208960	2211820	At least to ask the question, what's going wrong?
2211820	2213140	Why are people dying?
2213140	2214540	How do we fix this scenario?
2214540	2218860	They would not charge forward and kill tens of millions of people like every communist
2218860	2220780	leader in the history of humanity has done.
2220780	2225060	This is why you can never trust the moron that says true communism has never been tried,
2225060	2227140	or actual socialism has never existed.
2227140	2231300	The implication is that everyone who's tried it were all morally deficient, but that they,
2231300	2235380	the speaker, somehow have the inhuman morality to make communism work.
2235380	2236380	But they don't.
2236380	2240240	They're human, with failings, and would be corrupted by the absolute power necessary
2240240	2241460	to make communism work.
2241460	2242620	Just like you or I would.
2242620	2244520	But they think they wouldn't be corrupted.
2244520	2247780	And they would hold that belief right up to the revolution that finally deposes them and
2247780	2249280	puts them to the sword.
2249280	2252280	Such is the nature of the person that believes in communism.
2252280	2255860	This conversation has taken us far beyond the bounds of communism as an economic system,
2255860	2257340	and for that I apologize.
2257340	2260820	But the failings of communism are so supreme that they cannot be discussed in an economic
2260820	2261820	vacuum.
2261820	2266180	Suffice it to say, communism fails as an economic system for the same reasons that socialism
2266180	2267180	did.
2267180	2271220	It fails to provide for its massive in-group, it fails to account for political excess,
2271220	2274940	and it operates on the hatred of the rich rather than the love of the poor.
2274940	2275940	On capitalism.
2275940	2278860	Finally, we're here to talk about capitalism.
2278860	2281820	I have no clue how long this video is at this point.
2281820	2285540	It's probably pretty long, but hopefully I have done an interesting enough of a job
2285540	2288980	at laying a groundwork for why capitalism just works.
2288980	2291820	Now there's obviously parts of capitalism that don't just work.
2291820	2295780	I mentioned them earlier regarding child labour, a lack of workers' rights, and the horrible
2295780	2298180	conditions of the industrial-era factories.
2298180	2302260	Those horrors make me fully understand why Marx, and other thinkers of his time, sought
2302260	2304780	desperately for an alternative to capitalism.
2304780	2308940	But those conditions don't exist in functioning western capitalist democracies, at least not
2308940	2312740	often, and I don't think that any reasonable person nowadays would object to government
2312740	2315220	intervention if something like that started to come back.
2315220	2320900	In essence, a communist idea of what capitalism is is about 150 years out of date.
2320900	2324520	The factories that Marx railed against, they don't really exist anymore.
2324520	2329320	We have child labour laws now, and minimum wage laws, and maximum work laws.
2329320	2332880	All reasonable restrictions that prevent an immoral employer from working their employees
2332880	2333880	to death.
2333880	2337000	Remember when I said that we can judge an economic system to be successful based on
2337000	2340000	its providing for its in-group, while not harming its out-group?
2340000	2345900	Well, industrial-era capitalism did fail that test, but modern, moderate regulated capitalism
2345900	2346900	does not.
2346900	2348040	But why does capitalism work?
2348040	2349560	That's a bit more complicated.
2349560	2353360	Unlike the five other economic systems, capitalism accounts for personal liberty.
2353360	2357420	It allows all people, including the working class, to have the choice to do whatever they
2357420	2360260	like with their lives as long as they're able to do it themselves.
2360260	2364200	Of course, there are still poor people, and starving people, and homeless people in this
2364200	2365200	system.
2365200	2366200	Capitalism isn't perfect.
2366200	2369880	But within properly regulated capitalism, poor people at least have an opportunity to
2369880	2371120	get ahead in the game.
2371120	2375760	For example, things like student loans exist in capitalism, where a poor person can get
2375760	2380040	a loan to go to school in a useful field, get a well-paying job, and then repay their
2380040	2382100	loans and join the middle class.
2382100	2386300	This is possible even in the USA, where the capitalist system lacks some of the more reasonable
2386300	2387300	regulations.
2387300	2391000	It simply requires that a poor person go to school for something useful, and not feminist
2391000	2392660	dance therapy.
2392660	2396700	Capitalism is inherently a hierarchy of merit, where people will rise and fall within a marketplace
2396700	2398580	based on three factors.
2398580	2401020	One, how much effort they put into it.
2401020	2403580	Two, how much of that effort becomes victories.
2403580	2407560	And three, how much they are able to learn from the effort if that effort becomes defeats.
2407560	2410800	It is competitive, yes, and competition requires losers.
2410800	2415360	And some people may lose many, many times, for reasons that are truly not their fault.
2415360	2418760	Capitalism doesn't account for long streaks of bad luck, or well-meaning people who just
2418760	2419760	can't get a break.
2419760	2422200	But that is what reasonable regulation is for.
2422200	2426080	And just so we're clear, the reason hierarchies of merit exist in the first place is due to
2426080	2429020	a mathematical idea known as the Pareto Principle.
2429020	2433260	The principle states that, over a long period of time, roughly 80% of the effects of a given
2433260	2436520	situation come from roughly 20% of the causes.
2436520	2441720	Delafrido Pareto, the father of the principle, had a hobby of growing green peas, and noticed
2441720	2446440	that as he planted and replanted his crops over the years, approximately 80% of his harvest
2446440	2450520	came from only 20% of last year's peas, and the rest of the peas only produced just enough
2450520	2452940	to survive one more season, or nothing at all.
2452940	2457600	The Pareto Principle has been accurately applied to many situations across many species, from
2457600	2459600	plants and animals to human behaviour.
2459600	2462880	It's what the libertarians would refer to as the exceptional individual, where a small
2462880	2466480	class of hyper-capable people do the vast majority of society's work, and therefore
2466480	2468320	deserve to eat the majority of the rewards.
2468320	2472400	I don't entirely agree with the libertarian interpretation of the Pareto Principle.
2472400	2476400	But at the very least, I know that libertarians understand the principle better than the communists,
2476400	2479280	mainly because the communists would never be able to grow peas in the first place.
2479280	2483040	A great way to explain why western capitalist democracies function so well is to look at
2483040	2485520	both the needs of the individual and the needs of the state.
2485520	2488880	In, say, a communist system, the needs of the state directly oppose the needs of the
2488880	2489880	individual.
2490880	2494900	Where the individual need to benefit from his work, and the state need to collectivize
2494900	2497960	and redistribute all work, naturally oppose each other.
2497960	2502260	Using the same type of comparison, fascist economics allowed for success or failure based
2502260	2507120	on merit, but only made it a matter of social collective interest when failure occurred.
2507120	2512140	In other words, fascism did not reward success, but it did punish failure, for the reason
2512140	2516020	of sabotaging the state's economy and wasting the people's resources.
2516020	2519080	Western liberal capitalist democracies generally don't do this.
2519280	2522080	In fact, when they function correctly, they do the opposite.
2522080	2526360	We consider it a matter of social collective interest only when an economic endeavor succeeds.
2526360	2530680	In other words, we reward success, but we do not punish failure, because we understand
2530680	2533540	that failure in economics is punishment enough all on its own.
2533540	2537200	Just like with communism, fascism pits the economic forces of the state and the people
2537200	2538520	directly against each other.
2538520	2542080	But within capitalism, the needs of the individual and the needs of the state are aligned.
2542080	2546040	It's in the best interest of the individual to benefit from his work, for obvious reasons.
2546040	2548880	But it's also in the best interest of the state that the individual benefit from his
2548880	2552160	work, due to the wider benefits of trade with other individuals.
2552160	2553160	Still don't get it?
2553160	2554160	Here's a scenario that might help.
2554160	2556560	Let's say you have a carpenter, and he makes chairs.
2556560	2559440	The chairs he makes have a market value of $10 per chair.
2559440	2561040	He can sell them for $10.
2561040	2563200	And let's say you have a baker, and he bakes bread.
2563200	2566920	The loaves of bread he bakes have a market value of $10 per loaf of bread.
2566920	2569100	I know, we're just using hypothetical numbers here.
2569100	2573720	At first glance, it might seem like one loaf of bread is equal in value to one chair, and
2573720	2575600	to the marketplace at large, that's true.
2575600	2578360	But it's not true to the carpenter or the baker.
2578360	2583120	The carpenter has so many chairs, and he makes them so easily, they're not worth $10 to him
2583120	2584120	personally.
2584120	2587640	He's probably not going to go out and spend 10 of his own dollars on a chair when he can
2587640	2588640	make his own.
2588640	2589760	And the same goes for the baker.
2589760	2592560	His bread isn't worth $10 to him either.
2592560	2596120	So if the baker and the carpenter were to come together and decide to trade one loaf
2596120	2601320	of bread for one chair, even though both objects are worth the same amount of money, each person
2601320	2605200	values the other object more, because it's something they don't have and can't easily
2605200	2606400	make themselves.
2606400	2611600	It was a completely fair trade, $10 for $10, but the baker and the carpenter each got something
2611600	2614480	of higher value to themselves in the trading.
2614480	2619280	Everyone walks away happier, but more importantly, everyone walks away with more value than they
2619280	2620280	had before.
2620280	2622400	And by the way, that's the point of money, socialists.
2622400	2624060	Money has no power in itself.
2624060	2628120	It's simply a way of easily facilitating a barter system, where all individuals in a given
2628120	2632440	market value everyone else's goods more than their own, and are all willing to trade in
2632440	2636000	such a manner that everyone ends up with more personal value than what they started with.
2636000	2639760	Of course, there will be people that exploit the system, people who steal or sell fake
2639760	2642160	goods that aren't worth their price, and so on.
2642160	2646760	But the combination of an intelligent, well-educated population, market forces that allow quality
2646760	2650880	to naturally dominate over time, and in the most extreme cases, government regulation,
2650880	2653800	can adequately tackle the problem of economic exploitation.
2653800	2657600	This example also illustrates the value of specialization, a concept that the anarchists
2657600	2658880	can't seem to wrap their head around.
2658880	2663600	A carpenter can, over time, learn to build better quality chairs more quickly and cheaply
2663600	2665240	if he keeps practicing his craft.
2665240	2668480	A baker can learn to bake better quality bread for the same reason.
2668480	2672240	But if everyone had to learn every single skill, then nobody would produce anything
2672240	2673560	of exceptional quality.
2673560	2677280	Tell me, anarchists, how many part-time doctors does it take to cure cancer?
2677280	2681000	And I know that arguing from results is kind of a no-no, but let me indulge myself a little
2681000	2682000	bit here.
2682000	2686200	If capitalism is so flawed and weak and awful, why hasn't it been crushed yet?
2686200	2690520	Why do things held in community always fall apart in comparison to things held privately?
2690520	2694920	If these systems actually worked and didn't run counter to human nature, why do people
2694920	2697900	still not put their garbage in public garbage cans?
2697900	2701760	Why do parks need public works departments to regularly clean and maintain them?
2701760	2705900	Or on a larger scale, why didn't the Soviet Union outlast the United States?
2705900	2710320	Why has prosperity worldwide only improved under capitalism in the long term?
2710320	2711920	Why hasn't this stuff worked?
2711920	2714960	Oh, and the answer is not because it's never been tried.
2714960	2716640	It's clearly been tried.
2716640	2718300	You just don't like the results.
2718300	2722020	Believe it or not, sometimes the stated outcome on a theory does not line up with the actual
2722020	2723600	outcome of the practice.
2723600	2727760	In fact, if you are a communist, you should probably be happy that you live in a capitalist
2727760	2731280	society because if you really want to, you can get together your commune, you can go
2731280	2735960	off into the woods and live terrible, pathetic, dreary, collectivized lives.
2735960	2737560	Why don't more communists do this?
2737560	2740320	I presume it's because they want to drag the rest of us down with them.
2740320	2743460	And believe it or not, there's even a moral case for capitalism.
2743460	2747260	For all you moralists and spiritualists out there, aside from inheriting money, which
2747260	2751380	is its own separate conversation, or you finding a lucky twenty dollar bill on the sidewalk
2751380	2755880	or something, people generally only manage to get their hands on money by somehow contributing
2755880	2756880	to society.
2756880	2761180	You make something you sell or you go to a job where you perform valuable labor or you
2761180	2763220	donate to my Patreon.
2763220	2766200	At some point you have interacted in society in a meaningful way.
2766200	2769900	You have provided enough value to somebody else that somebody else was willing to pay
2769900	2771460	you money for that value.
2771460	2774420	So you take your money down to the grocery store and you ask the clerk there for some
2774420	2775420	food.
2775420	2779460	And the clerk asks you, well, did you contribute to society in a meaningful way today?
2779460	2780840	And you say, yes I did.
2780840	2782220	And the clerk says, well, how do I know?
2782220	2783500	How do I know you're not just lying?
2783500	2787940	And you say, well, I provided value to another person and he gave me this money in return.
2787940	2789580	And the clerk says, okay, that's great.
2789580	2791740	And then he takes your money and then you get your groceries.
2791740	2795180	That's the underlying conversation that happens when you go shopping for groceries.
2795180	2798660	And the money that you give the clerk eventually makes its way back to him in the form of wages
2798660	2800860	for his labor and the cycle continues.
2800860	2805540	In this instance, possession of money can be seen as proof of contribution to society,
2805540	2807180	which does have moral implications.
2807180	2810260	I know this isn't perfect because there are certainly jobs that should be getting paid
2810260	2812940	more for moral reasons that currently aren't.
2812940	2813940	But we're getting there.
2813940	2816000	No, really, we're getting there.
2816000	2818740	Capitalism is the reason we're living in the age of technology.
2818740	2822300	Capitalism is the reason there have been massive quality of life increases worldwide in the
2822300	2823900	past hundred years.
2823900	2827340	Capitalism is the reason that when the United Nations stated their intent to cut world poverty
2827340	2831420	in half by 2015, they managed to hit that mark in 2011.
2831420	2835580	Capitalism is not just the mindless pursuit of wealth until the entire system destroys
2835580	2836580	itself.
2836580	2840460	At least, not if it's properly regulated with the interest of the individual at heart.
2840460	2844140	Capitalism is a system where people can act freely in accordance with their own desires.
2844140	2847800	And if the fruits of the work they perform in the service of their desires has some worth
2847800	2852500	to their fellow man, capitalism allows them to survive and thrive off of those fruits.
2852500	2854660	But of course, capitalism isn't perfect either.
2854660	2856700	There's still a lot of people out there who fall through the cracks.
2856700	2860900	But a well-regulated, but not state-controlled capitalist economy, interfered with by the
2860900	2863820	government not for the benefit of the state or the collective, but for the benefit of
2863820	2868060	the individual, and only interfered with so that they may freely contribute value to one
2868060	2872180	another, will have the tools that we need not to help the poor, but to allow the poor
2872180	2873180	to help themselves.
2873180	2877900	And let me corrupt the Winston Churchill quote here a little bit for my own ends.
2877900	2881900	Capitalism is the worst form of economics, except for all those other forms that have
2881900	2886580	been tried from time to time.
2886580	2888620	Thank you guys for listening to this one.
2888620	2892340	As I'm currently recording this, the audio file is an hour and a half long.

2924020	2927900	provided you with enough value to warrant giving me some money for, please consider
