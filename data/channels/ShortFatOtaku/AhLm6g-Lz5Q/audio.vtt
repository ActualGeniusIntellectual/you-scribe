00:00.000 --> 00:02.040
Hey guys, Dev finally here with a new video.

00:02.040 --> 00:06.080
I know it's been nearly two months since the last full SFO video and I apologize for

00:06.080 --> 00:07.080
that.

00:07.080 --> 00:09.240
Real life has kept me a bit run down recently.

00:09.240 --> 00:12.560
But I'm back and I'm going to be doing my best to maintain a regular schedule.

00:12.560 --> 00:16.860
While I was gone I was still working on and off on a handful of different videos.

00:16.860 --> 00:20.280
One of them was on net neutrality, because it's a topic that's returned to the forefront

00:20.280 --> 00:23.580
of everyone's minds in the past week and will likely stay there for the next little

00:23.580 --> 00:26.640
bit due to recent and ongoing happenings on the subject.

00:26.640 --> 00:30.440
However, I realized that the arguments I wanted to present in that video required that

00:30.440 --> 00:35.040
I lay a rather large foundation on the topic of the pros and cons of capitalism, which

00:35.040 --> 00:38.600
just so happened to be the focus of one of the other scripts I was working on during

00:38.600 --> 00:39.600
the break.

00:39.600 --> 00:43.460
So, let's spend this time discussing the inner workings of capitalism, and I'll put

00:43.460 --> 00:47.920
out a companion piece a few days after this video goes live on net neutrality, using this

00:47.920 --> 00:51.960
video as a basis for it and feeding us into that conversation as best I can.

00:51.960 --> 00:57.040
The premise I'm starting with is that capitalism is the single most successful, prosperous,

00:57.040 --> 01:00.500
egalitarian, and robust economic system in human history.

01:00.500 --> 01:04.700
We need to examine not only how this can be so, but why it is so.

01:04.700 --> 01:08.520
And coming to this understanding is going to require us not only to examine the positives

01:08.520 --> 01:12.660
and negatives of capitalism, but also the positives and negatives of a few of its main

01:12.660 --> 01:18.880
historical competitors, namely socialism, communism, feudalism, fascism, and anarchism.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.840
Now that's a lot to unpack, so please bear with me a bit.

01:21.840 --> 01:24.720
Let's start with a few basic definitions, to set things up.

01:24.720 --> 01:29.160
I'll pull these first two from Wikipedia, yes, I know, but for our purposes they will

01:29.160 --> 01:30.160
do.

01:30.160 --> 01:34.800
A social system can be reasonably defined as a patterned network of relationships constituting

01:34.800 --> 01:38.640
a coherent whole that exists between individuals, groups, and institutions.

01:38.640 --> 01:42.520
An individual may belong to multiple social systems at once.

01:42.520 --> 01:47.560
Examples of social systems include nuclear family units, communities, cities, nations,

01:47.560 --> 01:50.440
college campuses, corporations, and industries.

01:50.440 --> 01:55.240
The organization and definition of groups within a social system depend on various shared

01:55.240 --> 02:01.300
characteristics such as location, socioeconomic status, race, religion, societal function,

02:01.300 --> 02:02.980
or other distinguishable features.

02:02.980 --> 02:08.360
An economic system can be reasonably defined as a system of production, resource allocation,

02:08.360 --> 02:12.720
and distribution of goods and services within a society or a given geographic area.

02:12.720 --> 02:18.040
It includes the combination of the various institutions, agencies, entities, decision

02:18.040 --> 02:22.420
making processes, and patterns of consumption that comprise the economic structure of a

02:22.420 --> 02:24.300
given community.

02:24.300 --> 02:27.340
As such, an economic system is a type of social system.

02:27.340 --> 02:31.100
From these definitions we can glean that a social system is an area of human interpersonal

02:31.100 --> 02:33.720
behavior that governs a specific part of society.

02:33.720 --> 02:37.800
An economic system is a type of social system that governs finance and production, just

02:37.800 --> 02:42.200
like a legal system is a type of social system that governs law and order, and the same goes

02:42.200 --> 02:44.820
for political systems, cultural systems, and so on.

02:44.820 --> 02:46.680
This stuff becomes pretty obvious when you think about it.

02:46.680 --> 02:52.600
We can also define our end goal for any given social system being in the service of humanity,

02:52.600 --> 02:57.700
meaning a functioning social system must serve the needs of as many people as possible, with

02:57.700 --> 03:02.300
a social system being considered more functional than its competitors if it is capable of serving

03:02.300 --> 03:06.480
more people, serving the same number of people more efficiently, or serving the same number

03:06.480 --> 03:09.680
of people with the same efficiency, but at a higher quality.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.800
So quality, quantity, and efficiency.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.620
Now I don't mean this in the strictest of utilitarian terms.

03:14.620 --> 03:19.080
In my video titled When Is Political Violence Acceptable, I do spend some time picking apart

03:19.080 --> 03:20.080
utilitarian ethics.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.780
But let me give you the cliff notes here.

03:21.780 --> 03:26.120
The idea of the greatest good for the greatest number of people sounds moral at a glance,

03:26.120 --> 03:29.320
but there is no safeguard in place for the people that fall outside the bounds of the

03:29.320 --> 03:30.320
greatest number.

03:30.320 --> 03:33.520
This is what is commonly referred to as the tyranny of the majority.

03:33.520 --> 03:37.880
If you want a simplistic example of the failure of utilitarian ethics, there is always bike

03:37.880 --> 03:38.880
cuck.

03:38.880 --> 03:42.520
In any case, this is not what I mean when I say that a social system needs to be in

03:42.520 --> 03:43.920
the service of humanity.

03:43.920 --> 03:48.180
While it's true that no social system can adequately protect the rights of, and provide

03:48.180 --> 03:52.800
prosperity for, every single human being, it also cannot actively work to violate the

03:52.800 --> 03:57.720
rights of, or inhibit the prosperity of people not within the system, at least not without

03:57.720 --> 03:59.200
sufficient provocation.

03:59.200 --> 04:02.560
Now there are some people who don't actually agree with me on this starting point.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.840
A good example of those people would be the hardline multiculturalists.

04:05.840 --> 04:08.760
When the claim is made that all cultures are basically the same, that they all have

04:08.760 --> 04:13.280
the same value, and that a nation is not intrinsically tied to its national cultures but instead

04:13.280 --> 04:17.680
to all cultures of the world, on an equal basis regardless of population demographics

04:17.680 --> 04:22.000
or language or history or anything else that exists in reality, this is a rejection of

04:22.000 --> 04:25.640
the idea that a social system must prioritize people within the system.

04:25.640 --> 04:29.200
And there's not really an easy way to bridge the gap between these two points of view.

04:29.200 --> 04:32.720
I mean, what's the point of having a social system if the bloody thing doesn't perform

04:32.720 --> 04:35.480
its work primarily for the benefits of those invested in it?

04:35.480 --> 04:39.640
The multicultural point of view is that any social system must equally accommodate all

04:39.640 --> 04:44.360
people regardless of their participation in the system, and this idea is both impractical

04:44.360 --> 04:45.360
and untenable.

04:45.360 --> 04:49.200
I mean, you can't continuously withdraw from society more than you deposit, any more

04:49.200 --> 04:50.800
than you can do so from a bank.

04:50.800 --> 04:54.240
But then again, I don't think that these people have ever had to balance a budget.

04:54.240 --> 04:57.840
So maybe I'm not so surprised that they think that piling on unrelenting burden is

04:57.840 --> 04:59.680
how social systems should work.

04:59.680 --> 05:04.800
But if we do accept the idea that a good social system must prioritize an in-group while still

05:04.800 --> 05:09.080
not causing harm towards an out-group, that gives us a way to measure the relative effectiveness

05:09.080 --> 05:11.560
of the six economic systems I listed off earlier.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.960
Let's knock off some of the simple ones right away.

05:13.960 --> 05:15.900
On anarchism.

05:15.900 --> 05:20.160
Anarchism as an economic system, or really as any form of social system, is a complete

05:20.160 --> 05:21.160
joke.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.160
It doesn't work.

05:22.160 --> 05:23.160
It never will.

05:23.160 --> 05:25.880
I honestly don't think that the anarchists have any idea about the nature of humanity.

05:25.880 --> 05:30.720
I can simply say, go read On the Social Contract, and despite the flaws in that book, this is

05:30.720 --> 05:34.600
basically all the refutation anybody needs to throw all flavors of anarchism out the

05:34.600 --> 05:35.600
window.

05:35.600 --> 05:39.560
Anarchism describes a stateless society, where there is no government, no power structure,

05:39.560 --> 05:40.560
and no nation.

05:40.560 --> 05:44.080
And if this society ever manages to come to fruition, it will be promptly flattened by

05:44.080 --> 05:48.520
the next society over that decides to actually unify into any type of fighting force, because

05:48.520 --> 05:51.720
a stateless anarchist society will be entirely defenseless.

05:51.720 --> 05:55.880
But that doesn't even matter, because when you even get just two human beings together,

05:55.880 --> 06:00.600
there needs to be some form of self-mediation between them, some basis by which they recognize

06:00.600 --> 06:02.180
each other on some level.

06:02.180 --> 06:07.240
Even the most primitive, ass-backwards, uncontacted tribes have a power structure, a chief of

06:07.240 --> 06:11.360
some kind directing the others, because as it turns out, organization and specialization

06:11.360 --> 06:15.480
are good things for society, and an anarchist society by its very definition lacks those

06:15.480 --> 06:16.480
virtues.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.960
If you want to see anarchy in action, go watch The Thinkery's video on Slab City, and if

06:19.960 --> 06:23.400
you want to get angry about it, realize that these people take food stamps from the US

06:23.400 --> 06:26.680
government so they can live in houses made of scrap metal in the middle of the desert

06:26.680 --> 06:28.840
and spend their time destroying other people's shit.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.520
Anyway, it's time for judgement.

06:30.520 --> 06:34.920
Remember our criteria, we can judge a social system if it provides for its in-group while

06:34.920 --> 06:39.020
protecting the rights of its out-group in its given field, which is, in this case, finance

06:39.020 --> 06:40.020
and production.

06:40.020 --> 06:41.160
Does anarchism do this?

06:41.160 --> 06:43.200
The answer is a resounding no.

06:43.200 --> 06:46.720
Not only does it fail to do this, it fails to exist in any meaningful way.

06:46.720 --> 06:50.840
And should an anarchist society ever actually exist, it will likely be the result of a massive

06:50.840 --> 06:54.980
nuclear holocaust where entire continents are on fire and the few dozen remaining members

06:54.980 --> 06:57.920
of humanity are spending their final moments eating each other because the Earth can no

06:57.920 --> 06:59.500
longer support life.

06:59.500 --> 07:00.720
On feudalism.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.580
The case for feudalism as an economic system is another of the weaker ones on the list.

07:04.580 --> 07:08.780
Put very simply, feudalism was a system where the noble class owned land within a kingdom

07:08.780 --> 07:12.340
and peasants worked the land in exchange for the right to live on it and subsist off of

07:12.340 --> 07:13.340
it.

07:13.340 --> 07:16.460
Any excess value that peasantry managed to pull from the land would almost never actually

07:16.460 --> 07:20.580
stay in the hands of the peasantry, but return to the nobles who owned the land.

07:20.580 --> 07:24.060
Feudalism failed when the Black Plague hollowed out Europe, removing most of the serfs from

07:24.060 --> 07:28.100
the equation altogether, as well as a shift in policy away from nobility maintaining their

07:28.100 --> 07:32.740
own men-at-arms loyal to them and threw them to the crown and towards a more centralized

07:32.740 --> 07:34.500
professional military.

07:34.500 --> 07:38.820
Feudalism did manage to last until the mid-1800s in Russia, however, which would have a huge

07:38.820 --> 07:42.060
impact on communism in that country, but that's for later.

07:42.060 --> 07:46.560
So as an economic system, does feudalism provide for the largest number of people possible

07:46.560 --> 07:50.820
while still not harming those outside of its system within the sphere of finance and economics?

07:50.820 --> 07:53.180
The answer is again obviously no.

07:53.180 --> 07:58.520
The out-group, the serfs, vastly outnumbered the in-group, the nobles, and they lived lives

07:58.520 --> 08:02.540
of multi-generational indentured servitude with no possibility of personal freedom or

08:02.540 --> 08:04.100
social advancement.

08:04.100 --> 08:07.640
Feudalism was specifically designed to restrict the lives of its out-group as much as possible

08:07.640 --> 08:10.420
in order to keep them working for the benefit of the in-group.

08:10.420 --> 08:14.780
We can safely classify it as a failure, though this time at least it didn't require reducing

08:14.780 --> 08:18.200
the planet to a ball of ash in order for it to exist.

08:19.200 --> 08:23.680
The critique of fascism is a bit more complex than the previous two.

08:23.680 --> 08:27.880
Fascism is not only an economic system, but also a political system that exists as a form

08:27.880 --> 08:28.880
of hyper-nationalism.

08:28.880 --> 08:35.080
Nationalism, as a social system, is not always a bad thing, but when it turns bad, it generally

08:35.080 --> 08:37.680
morphs into some form of fascism.

08:37.680 --> 08:41.940
Fascism prioritizes all-encompassing state control over every single social system.

08:41.940 --> 08:45.680
The political system must be fascist, in order to maintain political power and direct the

08:45.680 --> 08:46.680
nation.

08:46.680 --> 08:50.240
The economic system must be fascist, in order to micromanage the economy for the betterment

08:50.240 --> 08:51.240
of the state.

08:51.240 --> 08:55.040
The cultural system must be fascist, in order to indoctrinate the people of the nation through

08:55.040 --> 08:56.040
propaganda.

08:56.040 --> 09:00.240
The military system must be fascist, as fascism values a state of total war, where the distinction

09:00.240 --> 09:05.440
between military and civilian disappears, and all production, all people, all economics

09:05.440 --> 09:10.440
and trade and art and everything else that exists is made to serve the war effort.

09:10.440 --> 09:14.520
Fascism is ultimately totalitarian in nature because by its own definition it must control

09:14.520 --> 09:15.720
and govern everything.

09:15.760 --> 09:20.360
Oh, and for those of you calling the modern alt-right fascists or Nazis, you might want

09:20.360 --> 09:24.240
to re-listen to the definition of fascism as a social system that I just gave you.

09:24.240 --> 09:28.460
I very rarely agree with the alt-right, but they do not meet the definition of fascism,

09:28.460 --> 09:29.780
on multiple criteria.

09:29.780 --> 09:32.240
So let's talk fascist economics.

09:32.240 --> 09:35.920
In Alfred Rocco's The Political Doctrine of Fascism, Rocco writes,

09:45.720 --> 09:49.800
it considers the economic development, and especially the production of wealth, as an

09:49.800 --> 09:54.480
eminently social concern, wealth being for society an essential element of power and

09:54.480 --> 09:55.480
prosperity.

09:55.480 --> 09:58.720
But fascism maintains that in the ordinary run of events economic liberty serves the

09:58.720 --> 10:03.300
social purposes best, that it is profitable to entrust to individual initiative the task

10:03.300 --> 10:07.580
of economic development both as to production and as to distribution, that in the economic

10:07.580 --> 10:12.000
world individual ambition is the most effective means for obtaining the best social results

10:12.000 --> 10:13.240
with the least effort.

10:13.240 --> 10:17.240
Therefore on the question also of economic liberty the fascists differ fundamentally

10:17.240 --> 10:18.400
from the liberals.

10:18.400 --> 10:22.560
The liberals see in liberty a principle, the fascists accept it as a method.

10:22.560 --> 10:25.680
By the liberals, freedom is recognized in the interest of the citizens.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.280
The fascists grant freedom in the interest of the state.

10:28.280 --> 10:32.600
In other terms, fascists make of the individual an economic instrument for the advancement

10:32.600 --> 10:37.200
of society, an instrument which they use so long as it functions, in which they subordinate

10:37.200 --> 10:38.560
when no longer serviceable.

10:38.560 --> 10:43.720
In this guise, fascism solves the eternal problem of economic freedom and of state interference,

10:43.720 --> 10:47.640
considering both as mere methods which may or may not be employed in accordance with

10:47.640 --> 10:49.000
the social needs at the moment.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.820
On first glance, this might sound pretty good, because hey, the fascists aren't stuck to

10:52.820 --> 10:56.180
one specific economic policy, they're willing to swap things around based on what works

10:56.180 --> 10:57.400
best for any given time.

10:57.400 --> 11:01.240
But then you notice that they define what works best by what's best for the state,

11:01.240 --> 11:03.520
and by the state they mean the government, the party.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.680
And then you notice that individual rights are only respected while they're in alignment

11:06.680 --> 11:07.680
with the state.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.520
And then you realize that there's nothing built into fascist economics to stop the state

11:11.520 --> 11:14.100
from turning on the individual when it suits them to do so.

11:14.100 --> 11:18.120
Fascist economists believe that their pulling bits and pieces from capitalism and communism

11:18.120 --> 11:21.420
meant that they represented a true third option to the problem of economics.

11:21.420 --> 11:24.940
Unlike communists, they believed that the existence of social hierarchy was beneficial

11:24.940 --> 11:25.940
to society.

11:25.940 --> 11:29.360
But unlike capitalists, they believed that the government had a fundamental role to play

11:29.360 --> 11:32.620
in managing the economic interactions between the various classes.

11:32.620 --> 11:36.740
Like laissez-faire capitalists, they believed in social Darwinism within business, where

11:36.800 --> 11:41.060
people were allowed to catastrophically fail or miraculously secede based on their own

11:41.060 --> 11:42.060
merits.

11:42.060 --> 11:45.420
But like socialists, they believed that a catastrophic failure in the private sector

11:45.420 --> 11:49.740
set back not only the entrepreneur, but the state, and therefore the people of the nation.

11:49.740 --> 11:52.560
And the entrepreneur was responsible to the collective in this regard.

11:52.560 --> 11:57.560
In George Reisman's essay, Why Nazism was Socialism and Why Socialism is Totalitarian,

11:57.560 --> 12:02.380
Reisman goes into great detail describing how fascist economics eventually snowballed

12:02.380 --> 12:06.220
into the extreme restriction of all freedoms, not just economic but personal freedom.

12:06.220 --> 12:08.740
Freedom of the press, freedom of expression, and so on.

12:08.740 --> 12:11.980
It's a really interesting read, and I recommend you take a look at it, but the basic idea

12:11.980 --> 12:16.100
is that Nazi Germany printed a whole bunch of excess money in order to finance its war

12:16.100 --> 12:17.100
effort.

12:17.100 --> 12:21.740
Dumping that much money into a free capitalist system caused hyperinflation, so in response,

12:21.740 --> 12:25.100
the German government took control of most of the private businesses, and instituted

12:25.100 --> 12:27.580
price controls and rationing of goods.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.660
Because of the lack of freedom regarding what could be bought and sold, and at what price

12:30.660 --> 12:33.360
and quantity, a large black market developed.

12:33.360 --> 12:37.060
In response to the black market, the German government began issuing fines for anybody

12:37.060 --> 12:39.160
caught dealing in an authorized business.

12:39.160 --> 12:43.480
But the official state economy was so heavily controlled, and the black market was so profitable,

12:43.480 --> 12:47.560
even excessively large fines could simply be absorbed into the huge profit margins as

12:47.560 --> 12:48.920
a business expense.

12:48.920 --> 12:52.960
So the German government had to set up a justice system in which the penalty for black market

12:52.960 --> 12:57.940
trade was long-term incarceration or death, a secret network of spies to not only infiltrate

12:57.940 --> 13:01.960
black markets but also intimidate uninvolved citizens into keeping their noses clean, and

13:01.960 --> 13:05.920
a police force empowered with the authority to spend swift justice on the spot due to

13:05.920 --> 13:09.840
a jury's obvious willingness to let somebody off easy for selling a couple of pounds of

13:09.840 --> 13:10.840
meat.

13:10.840 --> 13:14.720
And so, we now have the apparatus for the police state, which extends itself far beyond

13:14.720 --> 13:19.720
economics but exists because excessive government control of an economy requires it to.

13:19.720 --> 13:23.560
So, does fascism provide for the largest number of people possible within its in-group while

13:23.560 --> 13:27.680
simultaneously not harming people within its out-group in the realm of finance and production?

13:27.680 --> 13:32.700
Again, the answer is no, but not due to its non-existence like with anarchism, or its

13:32.700 --> 13:38.160
extremely small in-group and the brutal repression of a massively large out-group like with feudalism.

13:38.160 --> 13:42.560
In fact, the in-group of fascism is very well defined as the citizens of a nation.

13:42.560 --> 13:47.280
The problem with fascism, as an economic system anyway, is not that it defines a large out-group

13:47.280 --> 13:51.200
and then brutalizes them, but that it fails to provide for the economic well-being of

13:51.200 --> 13:52.840
its large in-group.

13:52.840 --> 13:58.200
Even though fascism's in-group is clearly defined, individuals within the in-group garner

13:58.200 --> 14:01.420
minimal economic advantages due to their in-group membership.

14:01.420 --> 14:06.600
Of course, fascism clearly does violate the rights of its well-defined minority out-groups,

14:06.600 --> 14:11.160
but that has less to do with economics and more to do with other aspects of fascism.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.160
On socialism.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.280
Ah yes, socialism.

14:14.280 --> 14:17.680
Communism's little brother, and often considered a stepping stone for a society moving from

14:17.680 --> 14:19.660
capitalism to communism.

14:19.660 --> 14:23.300
Socialism is defined primarily by social ownership of the means of production.

14:23.300 --> 14:27.260
There are many different stripes of socialism, but they are united by the idea of social

14:27.260 --> 14:28.260
ownership.

14:28.260 --> 14:31.060
The means of production, for those of you who don't know, is socialist and communist

14:31.060 --> 14:35.620
lingo for the factories, the farms, and the other locations, equipment, and methods used

14:35.620 --> 14:37.300
to produce goods or services.

14:37.300 --> 14:41.660
So, in a capitalist society, the owner of a factory would employ workers to run his

14:41.660 --> 14:45.940
factory and produce the goods of the factory in exchange for a negotiated wage, which the

14:45.940 --> 14:48.280
owner would then turn around and sell on the market.

14:48.280 --> 14:51.320
The revenue generated from the sale of the goods would then be used to provide for the

14:51.320 --> 14:55.280
wages of the workers, as well as pay the owner of the factory enough for him to live on in

14:55.280 --> 14:59.720
exchange for not only the owner's ownership of the factory, but for his work in directing

14:59.720 --> 15:03.640
and overseeing the production, the hiring and firing of workers, and the negotiation

15:03.640 --> 15:06.360
of sale on the marketplace for his products.

15:06.360 --> 15:10.040
Socialists believe that the setup is inherently unethical, that the means of production cannot

15:10.040 --> 15:13.400
be privately owned by one person, but must be socially owned.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.320
Well, what does social ownership entail?

15:15.320 --> 15:17.160
Let's ask an actual socialist.

15:17.240 --> 15:20.720
Yeah, I got into a shitty Twitter argument with this person a few months back.

15:20.720 --> 15:24.440
I kept it up solely because I knew I was going to be using her stupidity in a video eventually.

15:24.440 --> 15:27.600
I won't bore you with the details, you can go read it yourself if you've really gotten

15:27.600 --> 15:30.800
bored with hitting your own dick with a hammer and want something a bit more painful.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.600
Here's the gist of her argument.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.260
Bosses at work don't actually do anything of value.

15:35.260 --> 15:38.360
Workers do all the work, and management just gets fat off of it.

15:38.360 --> 15:42.420
Therefore, any workplace must be socially owned, and must lack hierarchy.

15:42.420 --> 15:46.120
The workers would all hold an equal ownership of the workplace, and a council of workers

15:46.120 --> 15:48.280
would be elected to take the place of management.

15:48.280 --> 15:52.080
The council would collectively decide every decision the workplace makes, with input from

15:52.080 --> 15:53.320
the electorate of workers.

15:53.320 --> 15:58.000
Oh, also, in this hypothetical dreamlike scenario, the state would not exist.

15:58.000 --> 16:03.240
Yes, she was an anarcho-socialist, and that small townships and cities would have elected

16:03.240 --> 16:06.320
councils to independently rule them from any federal body.

16:06.320 --> 16:11.080
Which would effectively make them city-states, and would not be anarchy, but fine, whatever.

16:11.080 --> 16:13.680
I don't know where to start here, this is so absolutely moronic.

16:13.680 --> 16:17.440
I asked her if she believed it was inherently unethical for a boss to offer money in exchange

16:17.440 --> 16:18.700
for a worker's work.

16:18.700 --> 16:22.800
She said yes, because even if both the boss and the worker consent to the arrangement,

16:22.800 --> 16:25.820
it's oppressive and exploitative, because it involves a power structure.

16:25.820 --> 16:29.940
I asked her if it was possible for a worker to sell their partial ownership of a workplace,

16:29.940 --> 16:32.200
and she said no, because money would not exist.

16:32.200 --> 16:36.280
I asked her if having an elected council of workers would be too bureaucratic to function

16:36.280 --> 16:39.720
during a crisis situation, where a single boss having to make a quick decision would

16:39.720 --> 16:40.840
be more effective.

16:40.840 --> 16:41.960
And she dodged the question.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.260
I asked her if she knew that partial ownership by workers of a workplace already existed

16:46.260 --> 16:50.520
in capitalism, in the form of some companies offering stock options for employees as part

16:50.520 --> 16:52.360
of hiring, and she dodged the question.

16:52.360 --> 16:56.320
I asked her how her rules would be enforced, which is when she mentioned those township

16:56.320 --> 17:00.560
councils, and then I asked her if force would be used by these councils to prevent bosses

17:00.560 --> 17:04.720
and workers willingly exchanging in barter for work simply beyond partially owning the

17:04.720 --> 17:06.720
workplace, and she dodged the question.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.280
But here's the most telling part of my whole exchange with her.

17:09.280 --> 17:11.800
I said to her, let's pretend I'm running my own business.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.120
With just me working in it.

17:13.120 --> 17:17.400
If I wanted to bring on somebody to help me work, expanding my business into a two-person

17:17.400 --> 17:21.080
enterprise, I would not be allowed to simply pay them out for their work, right?

17:21.080 --> 17:24.820
I would have to offer this other person 50% ownership of my business?

17:24.820 --> 17:26.400
She agreed, that's how it would work.

17:26.400 --> 17:30.160
And then I asked her, well, what if I can't find anybody willing to work as hard as I

17:30.160 --> 17:31.320
am on my business?

17:31.320 --> 17:35.960
What if the business is my passion project, like say, my YouTube channel or my stream?

17:35.960 --> 17:39.920
Why should anybody else deserve an equal share of ownership in the project if to me it's

17:39.920 --> 17:43.640
a passion I will invest my all in, and to them it's simply a job?

17:43.640 --> 17:48.240
Her reply was striking, and it gave me a hard look into the mind of a true socialist.

17:48.240 --> 17:52.000
According to her, I didn't actually feel passionately or work hard on my business the

17:52.000 --> 17:53.680
way I describe myself as doing.

17:53.680 --> 17:57.760
According to her, all people inherently invest the same amounts of work into all things,

17:57.760 --> 17:59.840
as long as they're not being oppressed by capitalism.

17:59.840 --> 18:03.440
The idea that some people work harder than others, that some people have passion for

18:03.440 --> 18:07.840
their projects, that some people may be considered to be exceptional, was simply a capitalist

18:07.840 --> 18:08.840
myth.

18:08.840 --> 18:09.840
Everybody's the same.

18:09.840 --> 18:13.720
I was lying about my passion, and anyone I picked up off the street would do as a co-owner

18:13.720 --> 18:17.840
of my enterprise, because I don't work harder or care more, I'm just a liar.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.520
This is what socialism is, folks.

18:19.520 --> 18:23.520
It does not believe in the true passion that humans can feel for their life's work.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.000
It does not believe in a calling.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.320
It does not believe that people are capable of becoming more than they currently are.

18:28.320 --> 18:33.760
It attributes all differences in work ethic not to ability, talent, competence, education,

18:33.760 --> 18:38.440
experience or passion, but simply due to the oppression present in the boss-worker dynamic.

18:38.440 --> 18:43.280
And when that dynamic is removed, socialists believe all human beings to be unchangingly

18:43.280 --> 18:44.960
equal in their capacity to work.

18:44.960 --> 18:49.440
It does not believe in growth through effort, or successful entrepreneurship, or motivations

18:49.440 --> 18:51.560
beyond simply subsisting.

18:51.560 --> 18:54.240
Socialism talks about rights, but not responsibility.

18:54.240 --> 18:57.800
It talks about alleviating suffering, but not about creating wonders.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.040
It talks about survival, but nothing beyond that.

19:00.040 --> 19:03.020
It talks about being alive, but not living a full life.

19:03.020 --> 19:05.880
But like I said before, this woman was an anarcho-socialist.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.040
Maybe all the problems come from the anarcho part of that equation.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.000
So let's talk about state socialism.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.760
Well, we kind of already did.

19:12.760 --> 19:16.840
A lot of the arguments against fascist economics also apply to state socialism.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.000
A contemporary example is Venezuela.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.480
The Venezuelan government has seized approximately 30% of the nation's private enterprises.

19:23.480 --> 19:27.260
But that 30% consists of almost all vital private infrastructure.

19:27.260 --> 19:30.880
And just like what happened with Nazi Germany, rapid inflation has kicked in.

19:30.880 --> 19:34.840
It's become a Twitter meme at this point, with how low the Venezuelan Bolivar has fallen.

19:34.840 --> 19:38.840
I remember being astounded when the World of Warcraft in-game gold coin became worth

19:38.840 --> 19:39.840
more than the Bolivar.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.760
But that was months ago, and it's only gotten worse.

19:42.760 --> 19:46.560
The Venezuelan government's response to this was to limit the amount of bolivars people

19:46.560 --> 19:47.900
can withdraw from banks.

19:47.900 --> 19:50.880
A massive black market is also beginning to spring up as well.

19:50.880 --> 19:54.360
And if Venezuela doesn't change its course, we already know what's coming down the road.

19:54.360 --> 20:00.040
Spies, secret police, suppression of freedoms of the people, foreign scapegoating and propaganda,

20:00.040 --> 20:02.640
and transformation into a pure totalitarian state.

20:02.640 --> 20:07.280
It's a catastrophic collapse of an otherwise viable country based on purely ideological

20:07.280 --> 20:08.280
bullshit.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.720
And a lot of Venezuelans are starving and dying because of it.

20:10.720 --> 20:13.800
The Venezuelan government is committing human rights atrocities against its own people.

20:13.800 --> 20:16.840
And I don't care how often they say that they're doing it to try and liberate the

20:16.840 --> 20:17.840
working class.

20:17.840 --> 20:19.620
Look at you, you fat fuck.

20:19.620 --> 20:22.920
You've gained like 50 pounds during one of the worst famines in your country's history,

20:22.920 --> 20:24.240
and you've caused it all.

20:24.240 --> 20:28.440
And of course, the verified Twitterinos love to talk about how Venezuelan socialism isn't

20:28.440 --> 20:30.680
real socialism, because it's state tyranny.

20:30.680 --> 20:33.840
There's some understanding that socialism requires state tyranny to exist because the

20:33.840 --> 20:37.120
owners of the means of production aren't going to give up those means unjustly unless

20:37.120 --> 20:39.160
you impose massive force on them.

20:39.160 --> 20:42.520
There's a Twitter verified account called the Official Socialist Party, which by the

20:42.520 --> 20:46.100
way, shows you the real worthlessness of that blue checkmark.

20:46.100 --> 20:48.080
But this account has some choice takes.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.360
Like this, for instance.

20:49.360 --> 20:53.000
There needs to be far more discussions and preparations taking place worldwide so that

20:53.000 --> 20:55.640
there can be a smooth transition to genuine socialism.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.520
Actual socialism has never existed anywhere.

20:57.520 --> 21:00.200
It won't exist until global capitalism has ended.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.320
Outdated economics get replaced by better ones.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.840
A moneyless society with no ruling class is next.

21:04.840 --> 21:07.020
You know, there's a lot of things that are just straight up wrong here.

21:07.020 --> 21:09.400
But let me touch on one that I haven't mentioned yet in this video.

21:09.400 --> 21:13.040
The claim that actual socialism will not exist while capitalism exists.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.040
Why not?

21:14.040 --> 21:17.100
Can't you go have your actual socialism somewhere while some other group of people somewhere

21:17.100 --> 21:19.740
else not in contact with you has a capitalist system?

21:19.740 --> 21:24.160
Why does socialism need to be all-encompassing, blanketing over every country and person before

21:24.160 --> 21:26.240
it can be considered to be functional, or real?

21:26.240 --> 21:30.520
Why does the mere existence of capitalism somewhere outside of the borders of socialism

21:30.520 --> 21:32.920
cause socialism to fail spectacularly?

21:32.920 --> 21:37.240
Is it because socialism necessitates a tyrannical government, and a tyranny requires foreign

21:37.240 --> 21:40.600
scapegoats that its propaganda arm can use to distract the people from the tyranny they

21:40.600 --> 21:41.600
live under?

21:41.600 --> 21:45.360
Is it because if socialism actually existed everywhere, then there would be no more excuses

21:45.360 --> 21:48.840
for the government to use for its failure, and it always, always fails?

21:48.840 --> 21:51.880
Oh man, here's Jeremy Corbyn praising Hugo Chavez.

21:51.880 --> 21:53.220
And Michael Moore, too.

21:53.220 --> 21:56.400
Is there any reason why you chaps haven't decided to go and live in Venezuela since

21:56.400 --> 21:57.660
it's such a paradise?

21:57.660 --> 22:01.560
Or why you haven't socialized your own massive amounts of personal wealth and property if

22:01.560 --> 22:02.980
the poor matter to you that much?

22:02.980 --> 22:06.720
I mean, it's not like Venezuelans are resorting to eating their pets or anything.

22:06.720 --> 22:09.660
Or that teenage girls are working as prostitutes to avoid going hungry.

22:09.660 --> 22:11.900
That would be an awful state of affairs.

22:11.900 --> 22:15.420
Though, considering the pedophilic state of Hollywood at the minute, there's a fair chance

22:15.420 --> 22:19.020
that underage pussy on tap might actually motivate Michael Moore to move to Venezuela

22:19.020 --> 22:20.020
after all.

22:20.020 --> 22:23.860
Okay, okay, I know I'm just spending some time here taking the piss out of these idiots.

22:23.860 --> 22:26.700
Let's actually discuss socialism seriously for a bit.

22:26.700 --> 22:30.780
It's written in Trandran Kukkatha's article, The Cultural Contradictions of Socialism,

22:30.780 --> 22:34.140
that socialism is by its very nature doomed to fail.

22:34.140 --> 22:37.220
Socialist thinkers have usually presented social transformation as the solution to social

22:37.220 --> 22:41.340
ills, since the source of those ills has been held to be the social and economic order in

22:41.340 --> 22:43.900
which private interests and market relations are dominant.

22:43.900 --> 22:46.940
Once market relations are transformed, they have assumed the way we would be open for

22:46.940 --> 22:48.840
rule by the collective in the interest of the whole.

22:48.840 --> 22:52.880
In these circumstances, there is little need to say anything about how political institutions

22:52.880 --> 22:55.720
under socialism would check and control the exercise of power.

22:55.720 --> 22:58.740
The problem of the abuse of power no longer needs to be considered.

22:58.740 --> 23:01.840
It is liberal political theory that is focused on the problem of controlling the abuse of

23:01.840 --> 23:05.500
power, since it always assumes that there will always be a danger of such abuse.

23:05.500 --> 23:09.420
For in any society, there will always be particular interests trying to gain advantages for themselves.

23:09.420 --> 23:14.480
Tyranny is always possible, but socialism assumes, or hopes, that such problems will

23:14.480 --> 23:17.800
not arise, and so does not assume the need for political theory.

23:17.800 --> 23:21.840
Indeed, were it to borrow from a theory of politics, such as the liberal theory, that

23:21.840 --> 23:23.720
might help it address the problem of tyranny.

23:23.720 --> 23:27.720
Yet in avoiding such borrowing, socialism has also avoided in addressing the problem

23:27.720 --> 23:31.360
of how there can be a socialist order that is not simply a dictatorship by a socialist

23:31.360 --> 23:32.440
political elite.

23:32.440 --> 23:35.920
This is true of the socialisms described by almost every socialist thinker, even though

23:35.920 --> 23:40.200
all of them envision the good socialist order not as a dictatorship, but as a society marked

23:40.200 --> 23:42.200
by collective self-rule for the good of the whole.

23:42.200 --> 23:46.300
In other words, socialism simply assumes that when capitalism is swept aside, the economic

23:46.300 --> 23:49.740
system and the people within it will naturally settle into work or ownership of the means

23:49.740 --> 23:50.900
of production, all on its own.

23:50.900 --> 23:54.020
I know I'm sounding like a broken record here at this point, but it's pretty clear

23:54.020 --> 23:56.700
that the socialists are ignorant regarding the nature of humanity.

23:56.700 --> 23:59.220
Finally, we come to the judgement of socialism.

23:59.220 --> 24:03.500
As an economic system, does socialism provide for a widely established in-group, while still

24:03.500 --> 24:07.380
respecting the rights of a minority out-group, in the realm of finance and production?

24:07.380 --> 24:11.180
Well, first of all, socialism lacks an out-group entirely.

24:11.180 --> 24:15.820
You could make the argument that socialism's out-group are the bosses, or owners, or management

24:15.820 --> 24:16.900
of a workplace.

24:16.900 --> 24:20.860
But unlike communism, which simply wants to kill those people, socialism wants to demote

24:20.860 --> 24:22.780
them to the position of co-owner.

24:22.780 --> 24:27.440
So unlike anarchism, feudalism, or fascism, socialism wants to absorb as many people as

24:27.440 --> 24:32.340
it can into its in-group, from its out-group, until the out-group no longer exists.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.780
But does it provide for its in-group?

24:34.780 --> 24:37.940
The only reasonable conclusion one can come to is no.

24:37.940 --> 24:42.300
As an economic system, socialism does not provide for its in-group for several reasons.

24:42.300 --> 24:46.300
One, it's too bogged down with its own bureaucracy to make expediated decisions.

24:46.300 --> 24:50.860
Two, it provides no safeguards against its massive bureaucracy from becoming extremely

24:50.860 --> 24:51.860
corrupt.

24:51.860 --> 24:56.260
Three, it believes that the capability of becoming corrupt is some capitalist infestation,

24:56.260 --> 24:58.180
and not something intrinsic to everybody.

24:58.180 --> 25:03.080
And finally, four, just as it does not recognize that innate evil in human beings, it also

25:03.080 --> 25:07.500
does not recognize the innate good in human beings, to strive for excellence.

25:07.500 --> 25:12.140
Socialism fails not only as an economic system, but as any form of social system.

25:12.140 --> 25:13.420
Non-communism.

25:13.420 --> 25:17.180
The critique of communist economics will likely use many of the same criticisms I use to critique

25:17.180 --> 25:20.460
socialist economics, because the two are closely related ideologies.

25:20.460 --> 25:23.340
However, there are a few key differences that are worth discussion.

25:23.340 --> 25:26.900
First, socialism advocates for worker co-ownership of the means of production.

25:26.900 --> 25:30.500
Communism, on the other hand, advocates for communal ownership of the means of production.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.340
Sounds similar, but is different.

25:32.340 --> 25:36.500
In a socialized factory, 50 workers might each own one fiftieth of the factory.

25:36.500 --> 25:40.580
In a communized factory, each worker owns the entire factory, and everybody's rights

25:40.580 --> 25:42.940
overlap, creating community ownership.

25:42.940 --> 25:46.820
Of course, in practice, both options often meant state ownership of the factory, due

25:46.820 --> 25:50.100
to the state being the only legitimate representative of the people.

25:50.100 --> 25:52.620
But fine, whatever, at least the theory is different.

25:52.620 --> 25:56.660
Second, like I mentioned just a bit ago, socialism advocates for leveling the playing field by

25:56.660 --> 26:00.220
forcing the bosses to have the same social standing as the workers, with everybody being

26:00.220 --> 26:02.420
a co-owner of the means of production.

26:02.420 --> 26:05.480
Communism, however, is entirely willing to just kill the bosses outright.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.740
Of course, this is not directly stated in the Communist Manifesto, but with a bit of

26:08.740 --> 26:11.820
reasoning, I think I can show you how this is indeed the case.

26:11.820 --> 26:15.560
The communist theory of hierarchy revolves around the idea that all hierarchies within

26:15.560 --> 26:19.340
a capitalist system are based in power, and only in power.

26:19.340 --> 26:23.260
The great class struggle that Karl Marx describes is a power struggle between the proletariat

26:23.260 --> 26:26.660
and the bourgeoisie, the haves and the have-nots.

26:26.660 --> 26:28.540
And there is some legitimate truth to this.

26:28.540 --> 26:32.940
The rampant, unregulated capitalism of Marx's time lacked a minimum wage or a maximum amount

26:32.940 --> 26:36.660
of hours' work per day or week, it lacked workers' rights and protections, and it

26:36.660 --> 26:38.340
had no problem with child labour.

26:38.340 --> 26:42.220
It would not be uncommon for the factories of that era to employ ten-year-old boys to

26:42.220 --> 26:45.740
work sixteen-hour days for a pittance, which is why so much of the Communist Manifesto

26:45.740 --> 26:50.620
revolves around either factories or farms, with industrialization and serfdom both serving

26:50.620 --> 26:54.040
to smother the working class, though using different methods.

26:54.040 --> 26:58.500
This is also why Russia ultimately became the core nexus of communist activity, as Russian

26:58.500 --> 27:02.540
feudalism had continued for several hundred years after Europe abandoned it.

27:02.540 --> 27:06.220
So okay, it's reasonable to accept that hierarchies are based in power, there's

27:06.220 --> 27:08.100
a lot of evidence for this to be the case.

27:08.100 --> 27:11.940
But communism claims that all hierarchies are based in power without exception.

27:11.940 --> 27:15.860
That if somebody got to the top of any given hierarchy, it was a power play.

27:15.860 --> 27:20.180
Communism leaves no room for, say, a hierarchy of merit, where the people who exhibit the

27:20.180 --> 27:23.680
greatest consistent skill rise to the top of the hierarchy based on that skill.

27:23.680 --> 27:27.300
And well, you might consider me to be naive for even believing that hierarchies of merit

27:27.300 --> 27:31.540
can exist in the first place, but no, no, I'm really not naive.

27:31.540 --> 27:35.700
Of course, power plays can corrupt hierarchies of merit, but power can only corrupt a hierarchy

27:35.700 --> 27:38.820
of merit so much before the hierarchy ceases to function entirely.

27:38.820 --> 27:42.980
And really, can we reasonably say that the hierarchies of merit that exist within Western

27:42.980 --> 27:46.340
capitalist democracies have been compromised to that degree?

27:46.340 --> 27:47.340
I don't think we can.

27:47.340 --> 27:50.780
I mean, look around you, you're likely watching this video on a computer right now,

27:50.780 --> 27:52.620
which gets its power through the power grid.

27:52.620 --> 27:55.940
And the data is being sent from your internet provider through the telecommunications grid.

27:55.940 --> 28:00.000
If the hierarchies of merit that govern electricity and the internet in your area were so hopelessly

28:00.000 --> 28:03.820
corrupted by incompetent people making power plays, would you still have power and internet

28:03.820 --> 28:04.820
at all?

28:04.940 --> 28:08.260
The fact that you're even able to hear my voice right now is testament to the hierarchies

28:08.260 --> 28:11.380
of your society functioning at least somewhat on merit.

28:11.380 --> 28:14.820
Complicated systems like power grids are falling apart all the time, and society is

28:14.820 --> 28:18.680
full of workers who go out and patch it back together constantly, and we are so good at

28:18.680 --> 28:23.180
doing this that we have things like water, power, heat, transportation, food, internet,

28:23.180 --> 28:24.940
and so on almost all the time.

28:24.940 --> 28:29.140
And hey guys, if you ever actually meet a communist, ask him if he had to get, say,

28:29.140 --> 28:33.220
a dangerous operation performed, if he would shop around for the most competent surgeon

28:33.220 --> 28:34.580
he could find within his budget.

28:34.580 --> 28:38.680
And when he naturally says yes, tell him that the competent surgeon is only in his position

28:38.680 --> 28:42.420
due to a hierarchy of power, and he would be better off going to the marginalized doctor

28:42.420 --> 28:44.060
instead of the privileged one.

28:44.060 --> 28:48.340
So, communism claims to want to upend those pesky hierarchies of power for the betterment

28:48.340 --> 28:50.520
of the poor, downtrodden working class.

28:50.520 --> 28:54.540
But in Soviet Russia, during the collectivization of all the farms, the most successful farmers

28:54.540 --> 28:58.260
were completely wiped out, either through force or starvation, and this action led to

28:58.260 --> 29:01.340
the starvation of millions of Ukrainians in the 1930s.

29:01.340 --> 29:04.220
Just so you can have a taste of what this was like, I'm going to read an excerpt from

29:04.220 --> 29:05.220
David Patra...

29:05.220 --> 29:06.220
Patra...

29:06.220 --> 29:07.220
Patrakarikos?

29:07.220 --> 29:08.220
Fucking...

29:08.220 --> 29:13.460
I'll read an excerpt from David's article, Why Stalin Starved Ukraine.

29:13.460 --> 29:16.780
People crawled into wheat fields to eat ears of wheat before dropping dead.

29:16.780 --> 29:19.480
They died from hunger in the act of eating.

29:19.480 --> 29:21.460
Children collapsed and died during lessons.

29:21.460 --> 29:24.300
A mother took the bread from her offspring to feed her husband.

29:24.300 --> 29:28.340
She could, she said, always have more kids, but she could only ever have one husband.

29:28.340 --> 29:31.780
A couple put their children in a deep hole and left them there in order to not watch

29:31.780 --> 29:32.780
them die.

29:32.780 --> 29:36.460
A father strangled his own children rather than watch them perish from hunger.

29:36.460 --> 29:40.100
Communities that had once been kind and welcoming became mistrustful and violent.

29:40.100 --> 29:44.940
Lynch mobs tortured people, and in the end, most horrifically of all, people began to

29:44.940 --> 29:46.060
eat each other.

29:46.060 --> 29:47.060
How could this have happened?

29:47.060 --> 29:50.480
The moral side of communism purports to care for the well-being of the poor.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.620
So what could be the rationale for the communist holocaust of the Ukrainian people?

29:53.620 --> 29:55.900
Well, let me take you through it step by step.

29:55.900 --> 29:59.700
There's a utopianism implicit in communist thought that goes a little something like

29:59.700 --> 30:00.700
this.

30:00.700 --> 30:03.720
If you could just get the damn bourgeoisie to stop oppressing the proletariat, the utopian

30:03.720 --> 30:06.700
society would be ushered in and all people would live in paradise.

30:06.700 --> 30:11.420
So the bourgeoisie is not only guilty of oppressing the proletariat, but is also guilty of preventing

30:11.420 --> 30:13.140
the utopia from coming about.

30:13.140 --> 30:16.900
And that's a pretty great rationalization for any sort of punishments communism may

30:16.900 --> 30:18.220
afflict upon them.

30:18.220 --> 30:21.700
And then you remember that the bourgeoisie also refers to people at the top of the hierarchies

30:21.700 --> 30:22.700
of power.

30:22.700 --> 30:25.680
And then you remember that communism operates under the principle that all hierarchies of

30:25.720 --> 30:27.800
hierarchies of power, even when they're not.

30:27.800 --> 30:31.520
And then you realize that, in Russia, the people at the top of, say, the hierarchy of

30:31.520 --> 30:35.540
merit in regards to farming were extremely poor families that had just managed to pull

30:35.540 --> 30:39.840
themselves up out of serfdom during the collapse of Russian feudalism due to them being the

30:39.840 --> 30:41.960
most competent farmers in the nation.

30:41.960 --> 30:46.660
And then communism, with its obsession with upending hierarchies, comes along and slaughters

30:46.660 --> 30:50.480
all of those people, causing a widespread famine because there's no one left who knows

30:50.480 --> 30:51.940
how to grow any food.

30:51.940 --> 30:56.300
Is this a case of the communists truly loving the poor and having good intentions, but their

30:56.300 --> 30:59.980
theory being so fundamentally flawed that it killed a lot of people?

30:59.980 --> 31:01.740
No, I don't think so.

31:01.740 --> 31:04.740
And this is where we finally come all the way back to communism's hidden desire to

31:04.740 --> 31:09.040
kill all their bosses, when socialism simply wants to strip them of their status.

31:09.040 --> 31:13.140
In 1937, George Orwell wrote the book The Road to Wigan Pier.

31:13.140 --> 31:17.580
It's one of his lesser known works, up against titans like Animal Farm in 1984, but it's

31:17.580 --> 31:19.080
still a very important book.

31:19.080 --> 31:23.240
In it, Orwell describes his own real life travels through the slums, ghettos, and mining

31:23.240 --> 31:27.180
towns of the UK, and paints a picture of desperate, grinding poverty.

31:27.180 --> 31:30.400
And really, you'd have to be a sociopath to not feel something for the people he encountered

31:30.400 --> 31:31.580
on his travels.

31:31.580 --> 31:36.360
It made sense that, at least for a short time after those trips, Orwell himself began to

31:36.360 --> 31:38.200
advocate for Marxist theories.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.960
However, this advocacy was short lived.

31:40.960 --> 31:44.800
And The Road to Wigan Pier ends with probably the most accurate view into the mind of a

31:44.800 --> 31:46.960
communist, though he uses the term socialist.

31:46.960 --> 31:50.720
From a thinker who briefly scared with the idea himself out of compassion for the poor,

31:50.720 --> 31:52.020
but later rejected it.

31:52.020 --> 31:53.020
Orwell wrote,

31:53.020 --> 31:56.880
It may be said that even if the theoretical, book-trained socialist is not a working man

31:56.880 --> 32:00.720
himself, at least he is actuated by a love of the working class.

32:00.720 --> 32:05.800
He is endeavoring to shed his bourgeois status and fight on the side of the proletariat.

32:05.800 --> 32:08.040
That obviously must be his motive.

32:08.040 --> 32:09.480
But is it?

32:09.480 --> 32:14.120
Sometimes I look at a socialist, the intellectual, tract-writing type of socialist.

32:14.120 --> 32:19.780
With his pullover, his fuzzy hair, and his Marxist quotation, and wonder what the devil

32:19.780 --> 32:24.380
his motive really is, it's often difficult to believe that it is a love of anybody, especially

32:24.380 --> 32:28.300
of the working class, from whom he is of all people the furthest removed.

32:28.300 --> 32:32.480
The underlying motive of many socialists, I believe, is simply a hypertrophied sense

32:32.480 --> 32:33.480
of order.

32:33.480 --> 32:37.920
The present state of affairs offends them not because it causes misery, still less because

32:37.920 --> 32:41.280
it makes freedom impossible, but because it is untidy.

32:41.280 --> 32:44.840
Poverty and, what is more, the habits of mind created by poverty, are something to

32:44.840 --> 32:50.120
be abolished from above, by violence if necessary, perhaps even preferably by violence.

32:50.120 --> 32:54.820
Hence the socialist's worship of great men, an appetite for dictatorships, fascist or

32:54.820 --> 32:55.820
communist.

32:55.820 --> 32:58.840
The truth is that, to many people calling themselves socialists, revolution does not

32:58.840 --> 33:02.640
mean a movement of the masses whichwith they hope to associate themselves.

33:02.640 --> 33:07.880
It means a set of reforms which we, the clever ones, are going to impose upon them, the lower

33:07.880 --> 33:08.880
order.

33:08.880 --> 33:12.160
On the other hand, it would be a mistake to regard the book-trained socialist as a

33:12.160 --> 33:15.040
bloodless creature entirely incapable of emotion.

33:15.040 --> 33:19.120
Though seldom giving much evidence of affection for the exploited, he is perfectly capable

33:19.120 --> 33:24.440
of displaying a hatred, a sort of queer, theoretical hatred, against the exploiters.

33:24.440 --> 33:27.760
Hence the grand old socialist sport of denouncing the bourgeoisie.

33:27.760 --> 33:32.320
It is strange how easily almost any socialist writer can lash himself into frenzies of rage

33:32.320 --> 33:37.640
against the class to which, by birth or adoption, he himself invariably belongs.

33:37.640 --> 33:41.520
Now to anybody who spends any amount of time on the internet, and especially on Twitter,

33:41.520 --> 33:45.600
and especially on the Twitter feeds of anybody with a verified blue checkmark, the person

33:45.600 --> 33:50.880
Orwell describes has to sound extremely familiar, from fashion and fanaticism to interest and

33:50.880 --> 33:51.880
ideas.

33:51.880 --> 33:55.280
He describes a man-child, somebody who lives in the lap of luxury and has never felt true

33:55.280 --> 33:58.920
suffering, somebody who dresses themselves up in a specific way to show their status

33:58.920 --> 34:01.960
but spends so much time bad-mouthing that status.

34:01.960 --> 34:06.560
He describes their fake rage against the oppressors, while not a peep comes from their mouths about

34:06.560 --> 34:07.560
the oppressed.

34:07.560 --> 34:12.120
These qualities all have their modern versions, from hipster game journalists, to rainbow

34:12.120 --> 34:15.400
haired shetwinks, to verified twitterinos.

34:15.400 --> 34:19.580
People who spend more time fake raging at whomever they perceive to be the latest oppressor

34:19.580 --> 34:23.920
of the day for the benefit of their own social status than they do on actual activism for

34:23.920 --> 34:24.920
the sake of the poor.

34:24.920 --> 34:29.520
And it becomes very clear exactly what type of people communists, and socialists too,

34:29.520 --> 34:30.800
are deep in their core.

34:30.800 --> 34:34.280
They do not love the poor, they simply hate the rich.

34:34.280 --> 34:38.780
So let's say a person like this comes along in states to use some rubbish like, hierarchies

34:38.780 --> 34:42.380
of power function by privileging the powerful and marginalizing the powerless.

34:42.380 --> 34:46.500
By the communists' own logic, the claim can be made that because communism privileges

34:46.500 --> 34:53.040
hierarchies of power over hierarchies of merit, that under communism, merit is now the marginalized

34:53.040 --> 34:54.040
quality.

34:54.040 --> 34:58.560
I think this is why communists hate the rich, because even in the most opportunistic, unregulated

34:58.560 --> 35:02.880
of capitalist societies, there will always be at least some people who manage to get

35:02.880 --> 35:04.680
rich based off their own merits.

35:04.680 --> 35:08.480
And that group will never ever contain the personality types that lead one to accept

35:08.480 --> 35:10.260
the philosophy of communism.

35:10.260 --> 35:13.920
From this point of view, the communist looks like a jealous, irrational child, determined

35:13.920 --> 35:16.980
to tear down everything solely because he wasn't the one that built it.

35:16.980 --> 35:19.640
But of course, the communists would never actually admit that to you.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.720
They probably wouldn't even admit it to themselves.

35:21.720 --> 35:26.320
If you were to ask the communist why he thought in these terms, his answer would be predictable.

35:26.320 --> 35:29.340
I care about the poor, and therefore I am a good person.

35:29.340 --> 35:30.720
And always in that order.

35:30.720 --> 35:34.420
Not I am a good person and therefore I care about the poor, but I care about the poor

35:34.420 --> 35:36.340
and therefore I am a good person.

35:36.340 --> 35:40.660
Well then, if you were smart, or even better if you felt like trolling him, you would ask

35:40.660 --> 35:45.400
the communist, well, when you say you're a good person, that's a position you're

35:45.400 --> 35:46.400
privileging.

35:46.400 --> 35:47.980
What about the ways in which you're an evil person?

35:47.980 --> 35:50.020
Aren't those ways being marginalized?

35:50.020 --> 35:52.560
And that sounds kind of funny, but there is truth to it.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.820
We all have good and evil inside of us.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.060
None of us are perfectly moral.

35:56.060 --> 35:58.940
And it's actually important that we recognize this fact.

35:58.940 --> 36:02.340
Because if we're cognizant of our capacity to hurt other people, then we can control

36:02.340 --> 36:03.340
it.

36:03.340 --> 36:04.340
We can make decisions with forethought.

36:04.340 --> 36:07.820
But if a person were to truly believe that they were perfectly moral in everything, then

36:07.820 --> 36:10.980
what reason would they have to be careful in their dealings with other people?

36:10.980 --> 36:11.980
They wouldn't have one.

36:11.980 --> 36:15.660
They would simply charge ahead, thinking that because they are perfectly moral, their innate

36:15.660 --> 36:18.500
innocuous quality makes charging ahead perfectly safe.

36:18.500 --> 36:21.720
And they'd leave a wake of destruction behind them, because they would be fool enough to

36:21.720 --> 36:23.380
not admit their own failings.

36:23.380 --> 36:27.460
In fact, let's say a perfectly moral person exists.

36:27.460 --> 36:30.280
And somehow this person was a communist.

36:30.280 --> 36:31.380
Best possible scenario.

36:31.380 --> 36:35.500
And let's say we as a society give that person the political power needed to make

36:35.500 --> 36:37.560
communism unfold in the real world.

36:37.560 --> 36:41.700
And as communism unfolds, and begins to fail because that is what it will always do, and

36:41.700 --> 36:46.300
people begin to die as a result of this, what would a perfectly moral communist do?

36:46.300 --> 36:47.960
They would stop communism.

36:47.960 --> 36:48.960
At least for a little while.

36:48.960 --> 36:51.820
At least to ask the question, what's going wrong?

36:51.820 --> 36:53.140
Why are people dying?

36:53.140 --> 36:54.540
How do we fix this scenario?

36:54.540 --> 36:58.860
They would not charge forward and kill tens of millions of people like every communist

36:58.860 --> 37:00.780
leader in the history of humanity has done.

37:00.780 --> 37:05.060
This is why you can never trust the moron that says true communism has never been tried,

37:05.060 --> 37:07.140
or actual socialism has never existed.

37:07.140 --> 37:11.300
The implication is that everyone who's tried it were all morally deficient, but that they,

37:11.300 --> 37:15.380
the speaker, somehow have the inhuman morality to make communism work.

37:15.380 --> 37:16.380
But they don't.

37:16.380 --> 37:20.240
They're human, with failings, and would be corrupted by the absolute power necessary

37:20.240 --> 37:21.460
to make communism work.

37:21.460 --> 37:22.620
Just like you or I would.

37:22.620 --> 37:24.520
But they think they wouldn't be corrupted.

37:24.520 --> 37:27.780
And they would hold that belief right up to the revolution that finally deposes them and

37:27.780 --> 37:29.280
puts them to the sword.

37:29.280 --> 37:32.280
Such is the nature of the person that believes in communism.

37:32.280 --> 37:35.860
This conversation has taken us far beyond the bounds of communism as an economic system,

37:35.860 --> 37:37.340
and for that I apologize.

37:37.340 --> 37:40.820
But the failings of communism are so supreme that they cannot be discussed in an economic

37:40.820 --> 37:41.820
vacuum.

37:41.820 --> 37:46.180
Suffice it to say, communism fails as an economic system for the same reasons that socialism

37:46.180 --> 37:47.180
did.

37:47.180 --> 37:51.220
It fails to provide for its massive in-group, it fails to account for political excess,

37:51.220 --> 37:54.940
and it operates on the hatred of the rich rather than the love of the poor.

37:54.940 --> 37:55.940
On capitalism.

37:55.940 --> 37:58.860
Finally, we're here to talk about capitalism.

37:58.860 --> 38:01.820
I have no clue how long this video is at this point.

38:01.820 --> 38:05.540
It's probably pretty long, but hopefully I have done an interesting enough of a job

38:05.540 --> 38:08.980
at laying a groundwork for why capitalism just works.

38:08.980 --> 38:11.820
Now there's obviously parts of capitalism that don't just work.

38:11.820 --> 38:15.780
I mentioned them earlier regarding child labour, a lack of workers' rights, and the horrible

38:15.780 --> 38:18.180
conditions of the industrial-era factories.

38:18.180 --> 38:22.260
Those horrors make me fully understand why Marx, and other thinkers of his time, sought

38:22.260 --> 38:24.780
desperately for an alternative to capitalism.

38:24.780 --> 38:28.940
But those conditions don't exist in functioning western capitalist democracies, at least not

38:28.940 --> 38:32.740
often, and I don't think that any reasonable person nowadays would object to government

38:32.740 --> 38:35.220
intervention if something like that started to come back.

38:35.220 --> 38:40.900
In essence, a communist idea of what capitalism is is about 150 years out of date.

38:40.900 --> 38:44.520
The factories that Marx railed against, they don't really exist anymore.

38:44.520 --> 38:49.320
We have child labour laws now, and minimum wage laws, and maximum work laws.

38:49.320 --> 38:52.880
All reasonable restrictions that prevent an immoral employer from working their employees

38:52.880 --> 38:53.880
to death.

38:53.880 --> 38:57.000
Remember when I said that we can judge an economic system to be successful based on

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
its providing for its in-group, while not harming its out-group?

39:00.000 --> 39:05.900
Well, industrial-era capitalism did fail that test, but modern, moderate regulated capitalism

39:05.900 --> 39:06.900
does not.

39:06.900 --> 39:08.040
But why does capitalism work?

39:08.040 --> 39:09.560
That's a bit more complicated.

39:09.560 --> 39:13.360
Unlike the five other economic systems, capitalism accounts for personal liberty.

39:13.360 --> 39:17.420
It allows all people, including the working class, to have the choice to do whatever they

39:17.420 --> 39:20.260
like with their lives as long as they're able to do it themselves.

39:20.260 --> 39:24.200
Of course, there are still poor people, and starving people, and homeless people in this

39:24.200 --> 39:25.200
system.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.200
Capitalism isn't perfect.

39:26.200 --> 39:29.880
But within properly regulated capitalism, poor people at least have an opportunity to

39:29.880 --> 39:31.120
get ahead in the game.

39:31.120 --> 39:35.760
For example, things like student loans exist in capitalism, where a poor person can get

39:35.760 --> 39:40.040
a loan to go to school in a useful field, get a well-paying job, and then repay their

39:40.040 --> 39:42.100
loans and join the middle class.

39:42.100 --> 39:46.300
This is possible even in the USA, where the capitalist system lacks some of the more reasonable

39:46.300 --> 39:47.300
regulations.

39:47.300 --> 39:51.000
It simply requires that a poor person go to school for something useful, and not feminist

39:51.000 --> 39:52.660
dance therapy.

39:52.660 --> 39:56.700
Capitalism is inherently a hierarchy of merit, where people will rise and fall within a marketplace

39:56.700 --> 39:58.580
based on three factors.

39:58.580 --> 40:01.020
One, how much effort they put into it.

40:01.020 --> 40:03.580
Two, how much of that effort becomes victories.

40:03.580 --> 40:07.560
And three, how much they are able to learn from the effort if that effort becomes defeats.

40:07.560 --> 40:10.800
It is competitive, yes, and competition requires losers.

40:10.800 --> 40:15.360
And some people may lose many, many times, for reasons that are truly not their fault.

40:15.360 --> 40:18.760
Capitalism doesn't account for long streaks of bad luck, or well-meaning people who just

40:18.760 --> 40:19.760
can't get a break.

40:19.760 --> 40:22.200
But that is what reasonable regulation is for.

40:22.200 --> 40:26.080
And just so we're clear, the reason hierarchies of merit exist in the first place is due to

40:26.080 --> 40:29.020
a mathematical idea known as the Pareto Principle.

40:29.020 --> 40:33.260
The principle states that, over a long period of time, roughly 80% of the effects of a given

40:33.260 --> 40:36.520
situation come from roughly 20% of the causes.

40:36.520 --> 40:41.720
Delafrido Pareto, the father of the principle, had a hobby of growing green peas, and noticed

40:41.720 --> 40:46.440
that as he planted and replanted his crops over the years, approximately 80% of his harvest

40:46.440 --> 40:50.520
came from only 20% of last year's peas, and the rest of the peas only produced just enough

40:50.520 --> 40:52.940
to survive one more season, or nothing at all.

40:52.940 --> 40:57.600
The Pareto Principle has been accurately applied to many situations across many species, from

40:57.600 --> 40:59.600
plants and animals to human behaviour.

40:59.600 --> 41:02.880
It's what the libertarians would refer to as the exceptional individual, where a small

41:02.880 --> 41:06.480
class of hyper-capable people do the vast majority of society's work, and therefore

41:06.480 --> 41:08.320
deserve to eat the majority of the rewards.

41:08.320 --> 41:12.400
I don't entirely agree with the libertarian interpretation of the Pareto Principle.

41:12.400 --> 41:16.400
But at the very least, I know that libertarians understand the principle better than the communists,

41:16.400 --> 41:19.280
mainly because the communists would never be able to grow peas in the first place.

41:19.280 --> 41:23.040
A great way to explain why western capitalist democracies function so well is to look at

41:23.040 --> 41:25.520
both the needs of the individual and the needs of the state.

41:25.520 --> 41:28.880
In, say, a communist system, the needs of the state directly oppose the needs of the

41:28.880 --> 41:29.880
individual.

41:30.880 --> 41:34.900
Where the individual need to benefit from his work, and the state need to collectivize

41:34.900 --> 41:37.960
and redistribute all work, naturally oppose each other.

41:37.960 --> 41:42.260
Using the same type of comparison, fascist economics allowed for success or failure based

41:42.260 --> 41:47.120
on merit, but only made it a matter of social collective interest when failure occurred.

41:47.120 --> 41:52.140
In other words, fascism did not reward success, but it did punish failure, for the reason

41:52.140 --> 41:56.020
of sabotaging the state's economy and wasting the people's resources.

41:56.020 --> 41:59.080
Western liberal capitalist democracies generally don't do this.

41:59.280 --> 42:02.080
In fact, when they function correctly, they do the opposite.

42:02.080 --> 42:06.360
We consider it a matter of social collective interest only when an economic endeavor succeeds.

42:06.360 --> 42:10.680
In other words, we reward success, but we do not punish failure, because we understand

42:10.680 --> 42:13.540
that failure in economics is punishment enough all on its own.

42:13.540 --> 42:17.200
Just like with communism, fascism pits the economic forces of the state and the people

42:17.200 --> 42:18.520
directly against each other.

42:18.520 --> 42:22.080
But within capitalism, the needs of the individual and the needs of the state are aligned.

42:22.080 --> 42:26.040
It's in the best interest of the individual to benefit from his work, for obvious reasons.

42:26.040 --> 42:28.880
But it's also in the best interest of the state that the individual benefit from his

42:28.880 --> 42:32.160
work, due to the wider benefits of trade with other individuals.

42:32.160 --> 42:33.160
Still don't get it?

42:33.160 --> 42:34.160
Here's a scenario that might help.

42:34.160 --> 42:36.560
Let's say you have a carpenter, and he makes chairs.

42:36.560 --> 42:39.440
The chairs he makes have a market value of $10 per chair.

42:39.440 --> 42:41.040
He can sell them for $10.

42:41.040 --> 42:43.200
And let's say you have a baker, and he bakes bread.

42:43.200 --> 42:46.920
The loaves of bread he bakes have a market value of $10 per loaf of bread.

42:46.920 --> 42:49.100
I know, we're just using hypothetical numbers here.

42:49.100 --> 42:53.720
At first glance, it might seem like one loaf of bread is equal in value to one chair, and

42:53.720 --> 42:55.600
to the marketplace at large, that's true.

42:55.600 --> 42:58.360
But it's not true to the carpenter or the baker.

42:58.360 --> 43:03.120
The carpenter has so many chairs, and he makes them so easily, they're not worth $10 to him

43:03.120 --> 43:04.120
personally.

43:04.120 --> 43:07.640
He's probably not going to go out and spend 10 of his own dollars on a chair when he can

43:07.640 --> 43:08.640
make his own.

43:08.640 --> 43:09.760
And the same goes for the baker.

43:09.760 --> 43:12.560
His bread isn't worth $10 to him either.

43:12.560 --> 43:16.120
So if the baker and the carpenter were to come together and decide to trade one loaf

43:16.120 --> 43:21.320
of bread for one chair, even though both objects are worth the same amount of money, each person

43:21.320 --> 43:25.200
values the other object more, because it's something they don't have and can't easily

43:25.200 --> 43:26.400
make themselves.

43:26.400 --> 43:31.600
It was a completely fair trade, $10 for $10, but the baker and the carpenter each got something

43:31.600 --> 43:34.480
of higher value to themselves in the trading.

43:34.480 --> 43:39.280
Everyone walks away happier, but more importantly, everyone walks away with more value than they

43:39.280 --> 43:40.280
had before.

43:40.280 --> 43:42.400
And by the way, that's the point of money, socialists.

43:42.400 --> 43:44.060
Money has no power in itself.

43:44.060 --> 43:48.120
It's simply a way of easily facilitating a barter system, where all individuals in a given

43:48.120 --> 43:52.440
market value everyone else's goods more than their own, and are all willing to trade in

43:52.440 --> 43:56.000
such a manner that everyone ends up with more personal value than what they started with.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.760
Of course, there will be people that exploit the system, people who steal or sell fake

43:59.760 --> 44:02.160
goods that aren't worth their price, and so on.

44:02.160 --> 44:06.760
But the combination of an intelligent, well-educated population, market forces that allow quality

44:06.760 --> 44:10.880
to naturally dominate over time, and in the most extreme cases, government regulation,

44:10.880 --> 44:13.800
can adequately tackle the problem of economic exploitation.

44:13.800 --> 44:17.600
This example also illustrates the value of specialization, a concept that the anarchists

44:17.600 --> 44:18.880
can't seem to wrap their head around.

44:18.880 --> 44:23.600
A carpenter can, over time, learn to build better quality chairs more quickly and cheaply

44:23.600 --> 44:25.240
if he keeps practicing his craft.

44:25.240 --> 44:28.480
A baker can learn to bake better quality bread for the same reason.

44:28.480 --> 44:32.240
But if everyone had to learn every single skill, then nobody would produce anything

44:32.240 --> 44:33.560
of exceptional quality.

44:33.560 --> 44:37.280
Tell me, anarchists, how many part-time doctors does it take to cure cancer?

44:37.280 --> 44:41.000
And I know that arguing from results is kind of a no-no, but let me indulge myself a little

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
bit here.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.200
If capitalism is so flawed and weak and awful, why hasn't it been crushed yet?

44:46.200 --> 44:50.520
Why do things held in community always fall apart in comparison to things held privately?

44:50.520 --> 44:54.920
If these systems actually worked and didn't run counter to human nature, why do people

44:54.920 --> 44:57.900
still not put their garbage in public garbage cans?

44:57.900 --> 45:01.760
Why do parks need public works departments to regularly clean and maintain them?

45:01.760 --> 45:05.900
Or on a larger scale, why didn't the Soviet Union outlast the United States?

45:05.900 --> 45:10.320
Why has prosperity worldwide only improved under capitalism in the long term?

45:10.320 --> 45:11.920
Why hasn't this stuff worked?

45:11.920 --> 45:14.960
Oh, and the answer is not because it's never been tried.

45:14.960 --> 45:16.640
It's clearly been tried.

45:16.640 --> 45:18.300
You just don't like the results.

45:18.300 --> 45:22.020
Believe it or not, sometimes the stated outcome on a theory does not line up with the actual

45:22.020 --> 45:23.600
outcome of the practice.

45:23.600 --> 45:27.760
In fact, if you are a communist, you should probably be happy that you live in a capitalist

45:27.760 --> 45:31.280
society because if you really want to, you can get together your commune, you can go

45:31.280 --> 45:35.960
off into the woods and live terrible, pathetic, dreary, collectivized lives.

45:35.960 --> 45:37.560
Why don't more communists do this?

45:37.560 --> 45:40.320
I presume it's because they want to drag the rest of us down with them.

45:40.320 --> 45:43.460
And believe it or not, there's even a moral case for capitalism.

45:43.460 --> 45:47.260
For all you moralists and spiritualists out there, aside from inheriting money, which

45:47.260 --> 45:51.380
is its own separate conversation, or you finding a lucky twenty dollar bill on the sidewalk

45:51.380 --> 45:55.880
or something, people generally only manage to get their hands on money by somehow contributing

45:55.880 --> 45:56.880
to society.

45:56.880 --> 46:01.180
You make something you sell or you go to a job where you perform valuable labor or you

46:01.180 --> 46:03.220
donate to my Patreon.

46:03.220 --> 46:06.200
At some point you have interacted in society in a meaningful way.

46:06.200 --> 46:09.900
You have provided enough value to somebody else that somebody else was willing to pay

46:09.900 --> 46:11.460
you money for that value.

46:11.460 --> 46:14.420
So you take your money down to the grocery store and you ask the clerk there for some

46:14.420 --> 46:15.420
food.

46:15.420 --> 46:19.460
And the clerk asks you, well, did you contribute to society in a meaningful way today?

46:19.460 --> 46:20.840
And you say, yes I did.

46:20.840 --> 46:22.220
And the clerk says, well, how do I know?

46:22.220 --> 46:23.500
How do I know you're not just lying?

46:23.500 --> 46:27.940
And you say, well, I provided value to another person and he gave me this money in return.

46:27.940 --> 46:29.580
And the clerk says, okay, that's great.

46:29.580 --> 46:31.740
And then he takes your money and then you get your groceries.

46:31.740 --> 46:35.180
That's the underlying conversation that happens when you go shopping for groceries.

46:35.180 --> 46:38.660
And the money that you give the clerk eventually makes its way back to him in the form of wages

46:38.660 --> 46:40.860
for his labor and the cycle continues.

46:40.860 --> 46:45.540
In this instance, possession of money can be seen as proof of contribution to society,

46:45.540 --> 46:47.180
which does have moral implications.

46:47.180 --> 46:50.260
I know this isn't perfect because there are certainly jobs that should be getting paid

46:50.260 --> 46:52.940
more for moral reasons that currently aren't.

46:52.940 --> 46:53.940
But we're getting there.

46:53.940 --> 46:56.000
No, really, we're getting there.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.740
Capitalism is the reason we're living in the age of technology.

46:58.740 --> 47:02.300
Capitalism is the reason there have been massive quality of life increases worldwide in the

47:02.300 --> 47:03.900
past hundred years.

47:03.900 --> 47:07.340
Capitalism is the reason that when the United Nations stated their intent to cut world poverty

47:07.340 --> 47:11.420
in half by 2015, they managed to hit that mark in 2011.

47:11.420 --> 47:15.580
Capitalism is not just the mindless pursuit of wealth until the entire system destroys

47:15.580 --> 47:16.580
itself.

47:16.580 --> 47:20.460
At least, not if it's properly regulated with the interest of the individual at heart.

47:20.460 --> 47:24.140
Capitalism is a system where people can act freely in accordance with their own desires.

47:24.140 --> 47:27.800
And if the fruits of the work they perform in the service of their desires has some worth

47:27.800 --> 47:32.500
to their fellow man, capitalism allows them to survive and thrive off of those fruits.

47:32.500 --> 47:34.660
But of course, capitalism isn't perfect either.

47:34.660 --> 47:36.700
There's still a lot of people out there who fall through the cracks.

47:36.700 --> 47:40.900
But a well-regulated, but not state-controlled capitalist economy, interfered with by the

47:40.900 --> 47:43.820
government not for the benefit of the state or the collective, but for the benefit of

47:43.820 --> 47:48.060
the individual, and only interfered with so that they may freely contribute value to one

47:48.060 --> 47:52.180
another, will have the tools that we need not to help the poor, but to allow the poor

47:52.180 --> 47:53.180
to help themselves.

47:53.180 --> 47:57.900
And let me corrupt the Winston Churchill quote here a little bit for my own ends.

47:57.900 --> 48:01.900
Capitalism is the worst form of economics, except for all those other forms that have

48:01.900 --> 48:06.580
been tried from time to time.

48:06.580 --> 48:08.620
Thank you guys for listening to this one.

48:08.620 --> 48:12.340
As I'm currently recording this, the audio file is an hour and a half long.

48:12.340 --> 48:13.840
It's going to be quite the editing job.

48:13.840 --> 48:16.340
Thank you to everybody who supports my work on Patreon.

48:16.340 --> 48:20.460
Thank you to everyone who tunes in, or even better, who subscribes to my Twitch stream,

48:20.460 --> 48:22.560
which I do generally about four times a week.

48:22.560 --> 48:26.540
Thanks to everyone who is in the Discord and being enthusiastic and asking me about where

48:26.540 --> 48:27.540
the video is.

48:27.540 --> 48:28.980
I know, it took me a long time.

48:28.980 --> 48:31.820
I'm hoping to get this up on November 30th.

48:31.820 --> 48:34.140
I'm going to work very hard to try to make that to be the case.

48:34.140 --> 48:38.340
If you enjoyed the video, please consider subscribing because I do upload this content

48:38.340 --> 48:39.340
at least semi-regularly.

48:39.340 --> 48:44.020
And if you believe that in this capitalist system of ours, my passion project here has

48:44.020 --> 48:47.900
provided you with enough value to warrant giving me some money for, please consider

48:47.900 --> 48:51.340
heading over to patreon.com slash shortfatotaku.

48:51.340 --> 49:16.140
Thanks for listening, guys.

49:16.140 --> 49:38.660
See you next time.
