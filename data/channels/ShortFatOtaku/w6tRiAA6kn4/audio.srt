1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
So I sometimes surf the childfree subreddit. I'm not really active there, but I have had

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,120
some friends post a couple of stories about me. For those of you who don't know, the childfree

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,480
subreddit is a community for people who have chosen to never have children, not because

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,240
they're infertile, but because they just don't want to do it. Personally, I don't really want

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,080
kids either, but I don't hate people that do. I just think it's a good idea that those who

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,240
want kids only have them when they're prepared for them. It's a very left-leaning subreddit

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,560
politically, and that's to be expected. In the past, men not having children wasn't

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,480
necessarily seen as abnormal, though it was expected that they would eventually have them.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,720
However, with women, it has almost never been acceptable to not have kids, and it's really

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,360
only with moderate second-wave feminism that the social acceptability of deliberate childlessness

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,960
on a woman's part was even discussed. So the community has a lot of leftists,

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,760
a lot of feminists, many of them the sane liberal type, but there's a few radical crazies too.

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,680
At the same time though, there's also a contingent of politically right-leaning users as well.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,000
The idea of purposefully not having children is not only grounded philosophically in the

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,520
second-wave feminist value of allowing women to have control over their own reproduction,

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,680
but it's also equally grounded in the male reaction to a society that has stripped all

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,920
incentive to reproduce from them. It's no secret that divorce courts, child support rulings,

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,000
and custody battles are all heavily weighted against the father, just like it's no secret

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,080
that a woman's option to not reproduce has socially never really been available until

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,400
very recently. Parenting is a biological investment for the mother, but it's a financial

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,160
investment for the father, and more people than ever on either side of the aisle are simply

22
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,840
considering the price to be too high. I'm getting into this because I want to establish

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,080
that the childfree subreddit is bipartisan in its membership. It's not exclusively full of

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,920
radical feminist women who masturbate to the ideas of the destruction of the nuclear family,

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,240
and it's also not exclusively full of MGTOW men who delusionally believe that they're a

26
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,400
prime target of spermjacking by any woman they ever meet. But just because the subreddit is

27
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,440
bipartisan doesn't mean that it's apolitical. Some people on both sides of the gender argument

28
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,360
find themselves radicalized and therefore at odds with each other. Despite agreeing on the

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,800
childfree question. A recent example of this is a thread titled I'm glad I'm female because no

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,520
one will ever have my child without my consent and then force me to pay child support on top of that.

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,440
The thread is now locked, and it's a perfect example of the childfree political schism.

32
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,160
Recently I read a post on this subreddit where OP's wife had tubal litigation but it failed and

33
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,560
she became pregnant. His wife was against abortion so she wanted to keep and raise the child. OP

34
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,480
decided to divorce and was upset about everyone judging him for wanting to divorce his wife over

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,920
the child and wanting to avoid paying child support. I was surprised to read the comments

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,160
below. Many of them suggested that OP was being the shit of the earth for not wanting to pay child

37
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,000
support for a child he didn't want, had taken reasonable steps to avoid the creation of,

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,240
and whose continued existence was being championed only by his wife and his judgmental parents and

39
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,840
friends. I understand that people should be responsible for kids they have willingly or

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,320
irresponsibly created, but in this case why the heck should OP be responsible and forced to

41
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,960
literally pay for his wife's refusal to abort or give up an accidental pregnancy for adoption?

42
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,720
Can someone explain to me why, if no one's allowed to prevent me from getting an abortion

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,640
or force me into getting one, why I'm allowed to force a guy to pay for a child if he's made

44
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,960
it clear he doesn't want it, but I made it exist anyway? I don't feel safe about my own reproductive

45
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,200
rights if there's this gaping hole in the opposite genders. Obviously guys shouldn't be allowed to

46
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,360
force women to get abortions, no shit, but why should they be financially burdened or obligated

47
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,440
afterwards? We give women the final choice in terms of a child's existence, and we just force

48
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,360
men to be responsible for her choice either way, regardless of his own feelings on the matter?

49
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,360
I feel like men have an obligation to help pay for an abortion procedure since the pregnancy

50
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,800
is partially his responsibility, but the continuation of that pregnancy is all in the

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,720
woman, since she has the final authority over the matter. This is a prime example of what I

52
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,520
would like to call the abortion paradox, that if we value equal rights between men and women,

53
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,400
we either need to ban all access to abortion or dismantle the child support system, because if

54
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,560
one gender has an easy out from the responsibility of pregnancy, then in the name of equality,

55
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,720
both genders must have an easy out. I'm going to attempt to present all sides of the abortion

56
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,840
paradox as objectively as I can, and let's see what we can make out of it.

57
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,520
First of all, we can't discuss the abortion paradox without discussing abortion itself.

58
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,480
The abortion paradox assumes that abortion, in a vacuum, without adding other connected problems

59
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,280
into the mix, should be a legal option for women. But there's still no consensus on that.

60
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,880
Some people are just fine with abortion, some people would never get one themselves but are

61
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,040
okay with it being legal, and some people want abortion to be illegal, with that illegality

62
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,360
having some exceptions or no exceptions at all. There's a range of opinions. The pro-choice side

63
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,120
of the argument believes that abortions should be legal. Their argument generally stems from

64
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,800
three positions. A, the equality argument. B, the lack of personhood rights argument.

65
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,960
And C, the bodily autonomy argument. The first one, the equality argument,

66
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,600
is ideological in nature, and has been described by several feminist authors, most notably bell

67
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,840
hooks, as the following. If men can have sex without fear of getting pregnant, then women

68
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,840
must also have the fear of pregnancy removed from the equation, in the name of equality and sexual

69
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,360
liberation. This point of view spurred the legality of the birth control pill, as well as

70
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,360
abortion access, in order to ensure that no woman carries a fetus to term except the ones that she

71
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,600
explicitly wants to. I can't back up this next statement, so take it with a grain of salt, but

72
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,000
Dr. Laurie Chambers, the chair of the gender studies department at Lakehead University,

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,400
explained this concept in her own words in one of her lectures. That even though biological

74
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,480
differences in reproductive systems create a disproportionate amount of risk for women when

75
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,440
engaging in sexual activity, Dr. Chambers asserted that equality demands that society,

76
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,800
culture, and technology fill the gaps where biology fails. The second argument, lack of

77
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,640
personhood, revolves around the status of the zygote or the fetus. It's clear that when a

78
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,120
pregnancy event unfolds properly, a fertilized embryo eventually becomes a baby with human

79
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,600
rights. The pro-choice position is generally that the fetus is not a person up until it's viable

80
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,520
outside of the womb, with some pro-choice extremists outright stating that the fetus

81
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,600
is not a person until natural birth has occurred. And this is why most countries with legal

82
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,680
abortions have a 20-22 week cutoff period for having the procedure. Before this time,

83
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,240
the fetus is not a person, therefore it has no human rights, and therefore abortion is not

84
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,560
murder. The Supreme Court decision Roe vs Wade, which legalized abortion in the US,

85
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,120
has a passage that reads, the state's interest in the life of the fetus became compelling only

86
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,200
at the point of viability, defined as the point at which the fetus can survive independently from

87
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,280
its mother. Let's discuss the third option, bodily autonomy rights. The right for a person

88
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,200
to determine what happens with their own bodies without interference from the state. The pro-choice

89
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,760
position holds that a woman has the choice to abort or not abort based on these bodily

90
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,240
autonomy rights. The bodily autonomy argument generally takes two different forms. The first

91
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,840
revolves around the woman giving consent for another being to draw sustenance from her body.

92
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,520
This point of view supposes that just like a woman may choose to breastfeed or not, a woman may

93
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,160
choose to nourish a fetus through the umbilical cord or not. As both actions take away energy

94
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,080
from the woman, energy which she may desire to keep for herself. And just like a woman may

95
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,080
remove a parasitic tape-form that's suckling nutrients out through her intestine, she can

96
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,400
also remove a zygote that's suckling nutrients out through her uterine lining. The second form

97
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,360
of the bodily autonomy argument involves foreign bodies penetrating into, or existing inside of,

98
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,920
a person's body. As a society, we generally view violations of the integrity of somebody else's

99
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,120
body as a serious crime. An obvious example is the illegality of rape, but other non-sexual forms

100
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,240
of forced foreign object insertion is generally also illegal. For example, tattooing or branding

101
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,720
somebody against their will is not only a serious crime, it can even be a human rights violation.

102
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,200
The bodily autonomy argument, insofar as abortion is concerned, posits that a woman's bodily

103
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,920
autonomy is violated when she has an undesired pregnancy. This violation can stem from her sexual

104
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,560
partner, the fetus, or both, and that therefore abortion rights are necessary to maintain her

105
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,040
bodily autonomy rights. Notice that the lack of personhood argument maintains that the fetus is

106
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,840
not a person and therefore has no rights, while the bodily autonomy argument can be seen as an

107
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,640
implicit acceptance of a fetus's human rights. If a fetus is a person, and it has human rights,

108
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,880
it therefore also has responsibilities. And if we are to take the fetus's actions against the

109
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,960
incubating woman as an assault on her bodily autonomy, then that is actually a serious crime

110
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,440
on the fetus's part, even if the fetus is doing it unintentionally. We generally do consider

111
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,360
unintentional crimes to still be crimes if they're serious enough, even when they're committed by

112
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,840
children. In this case, abortion may even be seen as a form of capital punishment against the

113
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:16,960
invader, or hell, maybe an eviction. Yes, I used this joke earlier during the Ben Shapiro at

114
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,280
Berkeley video, it was too good to pass up. In any case, the fact that the pro-choice arguments use

115
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,640
both a fetus's human rights and simultaneously a denial of those rights as arguments may seem

116
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,960
inconsistent on their part, but it also may simply be preparedness for any possibility.

117
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,880
On the pro-life side of the argument, people believe that abortion should be illegal.

118
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,440
Their argument generally stem from two positions. A, the responsibility argument,

119
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,080
and B, the sanctity of life argument. The responsibility argument is ideological in

120
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,320
nature, like its pro-choice variant. It states that consenting to sex is the same thing as

121
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,640
consenting to pregnancy and motherhood. They're linked by cause and effect. Having an abortion

122
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,960
is therefore a ducking responsibility for one's actions. The sanctity of life argument is a bit

123
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,440
more complex. It is generally a religious argument revolving around the uniqueness of humanity and

124
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,280
the existence of a soul, but there is also a humanist component to it, where the moral

125
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,520
authority comes not from religious belief, but from a reverence for sentient life. It's from

126
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,000
this reverence that a non-religious concept of universal human rights also springs. In either

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,760
case, the sanctity of life argument is fundamentally a moral argument revolving

128
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,920
around the status of the fetus or zygote as a person and therefore having human rights.

129
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,240
For example, some pro-lifers argue that abortions discriminate against people that have been

130
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,440
conceived but not yet born, and that abortion advocates do not actually value all human life,

131
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,640
only forms of human life that have reached a specific level of development.

132
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,560
If we can arbitrarily declare somebody to not have human rights based on their age,

133
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,920
why is it 22 weeks of gestation instead of 10, or 30, or one year old? It seems rather arbitrary.

134
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,920
Some people argue that abortions deprive a fetus of a future, a future that may be fulfilling,

135
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,680
pleasurable, or in some other way positive. This argument is the same as one of the principle

136
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,360
arguments against murder as well. A murderer deprives the victim of the experiences that

137
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,600
the rest of their lives may have held. So too does abortion. This argument often comes in the

138
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,760
simpler form of, what if your baby is the next Einstein, referring to the possibility that the

139
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,920
fetus may grow into somebody who positively impacts the world in some way. Some people argue

140
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,080
from safety that because we do not know when a fetus or a zygote becomes a person with human

141
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,480
rights, we need to assume that all fetuses and all zygotes have human rights even if it later

142
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,320
turns out that they don't, much the same way that reckless behavior that may cause the death of

143
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,800
another person is considered to be both morally and legally wrong even if nobody actually died

144
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,640
as a result of the reckless behavior. All of these arguments are derived from the concept of

145
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,200
universal human rights, with that universality also extending to fetuses and zygotes and not

146
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,440
just already born humans. There's a few other fringe pro-life arguments that we can dismiss

147
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,760
right here. Some people claim that abortion causes a post-abortion shock syndrome, that

148
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,920
abortions routinely cause infertility, and that even at a proper medical facility with trained

149
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,600
staff abortions are extremely unsafe. None of these are true and the evidence against them is

150
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,200
so overwhelming I won't waste any more time on it. So there we go, we've got the pro-life side,

151
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,200
we've got the pro-choice side, and we've got their arguments. And all the arguments on both

152
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,080
sides ultimately hinge on human rights. Let's see if we can poke holes in any of these arguments.

153
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,600
And yes, I'm doing it to both sides. So if you're currently in the middle of writing an angry

154
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,840
comment at least wait until the video is done, okay? The bodily autonomy argument is probably

155
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,400
the strongest one in the pro-choice camp. Even if the fetus or zygote has personhood rights,

156
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,640
which person's rights do you prioritize? The woman's or the child's? I mean, a woman can

157
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,720
always have more children later when she's more ready to do so. It may sound harsh, but it was

158
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,280
often the case in humanity's past, and is absolutely the case in the animal kingdom at large,

159
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,200
that a mother will abandon her child in a moment of extreme weakness or danger because at least

160
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,960
she will still be allowed to reproduce later. It's a sound evolutionary strategy. But there

161
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,000
is a funny hypocrisy to it. Most pro-choice people are also pro-vaccination. My experience

162
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,080
on the child-free subreddit leads me to believe that a lot of pro-choice people routinely make

163
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,520
fun of insane anti-vaxx Facebook moms. And I'm not anti-vaccination myself. I think vaccinations

164
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,080
are obviously a good thing, but let's talk about rights here. Do bodily autonomy rights not also

165
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,720
include the right to not get a vaccination? Is a vaccination needle not also a foreign object?

166
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,680
It seems to be a huge contradiction to me that people who champion bodily autonomy so much

167
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,840
would also force people to get vaccinations if given the chance. And in that same vein,

168
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,080
a large chunk of the pro-choice crowd are also socialists or communists due to the increasingly

169
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,400
large crossover between feminist theory and Marxist theory. But bodily autonomy rights are

170
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,200
predicated on property rights. Your body is your property, just like your house or your car or

171
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,160
your belongings. If society becomes collectivized, where the group owns the property, why do you

172
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,000
think you'd still have abortion rights? Why do you think you'd have any bodily autonomy rights

173
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,560
at all? There's a reason that abortion rights are a thing only in capitalist societies. Because

174
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,680
only capitalists recognize property as owned by individuals, and only capitalists view individual

175
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,400
rights, bodies and all, as meaningful. The pro-life responsibility argument is also a

176
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,040
walking contradiction. It makes no sense to demand that a woman must not take advantage of the latest

177
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,040
medical technology and have a safe abortion, and instead must take responsibility for her actions

178
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,720
by having the child she's conceived, when the history of human technological development has

179
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,960
been entirely based on the objective of reducing the amount of responsibility that people take in

180
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,440
their lives. The hunter-gatherer had a greater responsibility to hunt and gather than the farmer

181
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,320
had to farm. When humanity started building walls around their cities, the danger of attack by

182
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,640
either predators or neighboring humans also shrunk. People could walk around at night safer

183
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,960
than before, with less responsibility laid in on them to protect themselves. Medicine,

184
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:24,560
transportation, trade, it all serves to reduce risk and increase reward. And subsequently,

185
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,320
individual people have less responsibility to deal with. Saying that somebody should get

186
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,120
an abortion because they should take responsibility for what they've done,

187
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,880
is like saying you shouldn't pull your parachute during a skydive because you should take

188
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,120
responsibility for the earth rapidly rushing towards you. There's just no reason to do so,

189
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,840
and our entire civilization is structured against that idea. Some pro-choice people routinely argue

190
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,560
from the exception. That is, they believe that exceptional circumstances should dictate the rules

191
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,360
for ordinary circumstances. A common tactic is to advocate for abortion rights only in instances

192
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,120
where the mother's life is in danger. From there, this exception is expanded to instances of rape,

193
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,200
and then to detectable birth defects. And then, once the door has been cracked open that much,

194
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,880
they advocate for abortion on demand, under the guise of protecting women's mental health.

195
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,400
This is clearly a disingenuous form of arguing. In no instance, abortion or anything else,

196
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,720
should the exceptional cases of a situation become the primary basis for legal statutes.

197
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,760
Exceptions to the rule are just that, exceptions, they are not the rule themselves. And an argument

198
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,400
for widespread abortion access cannot be based on exceptions. The pro-life position of making

199
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,880
abortion illegal comes with a host of other problems. It's no secret that illegally performed

200
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,720
abortions regularly kill women attempting to get them. And prohibition has taught us that when the

201
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,800
government makes illegal something that the population desires, it doesn't actually eliminate

202
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,680
the activity or product. And furthermore, what would society do with women who is caught getting

203
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,680
an illegal abortion? Would you go to jail for murder? Would the illicit doctor go to jail for

204
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,720
murder? If the doctor but not the woman, why not? If the fetus has human rights, how would this

205
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,560
situation be any different from a woman hiring a hitman to kill somebody? Surely she would be

206
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,960
liable somehow. There's also an argument from consequences to consider. America's downward

207
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,240
spike in crime during the 1990s occurred because abortion became legal in 1973, and all of the

208
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,320
children of low-income single mothers that would have grown up to be criminals were instead aborted.

209
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,960
But most importantly, how would a government even determine if an abortion has taken place?

210
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,360
We already have instances of some US states attempting to charge women for murder because

211
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,800
those women had a miscarriage and it was later discovered that they had been drinking or doing

212
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,280
drugs while pregnant. What if a woman has a natural miscarriage and she gets charged with

213
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,240
murder because she did something minorly unsafe, like drive her car to work, and the prosecutors

214
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,080
determined that she had put her child at undue risk? What if women who are not currently on

215
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,560
their period are simply legally considered to be potentially pregnant and are therefore barred from

216
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,960
doing any activity that may harm a potential child? Making abortion illegal leads us down

217
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,360
a slippery slope that ends with the liberty of women restricted so severely that we may as well

218
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,920
be living under Sharia law. And on the topic of whether or not a fetus or a zygote has human

219
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,240
rights, frankly both sides have done a shit job at arguing their positions. On one hand,

220
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,160
it's clear that the pro-choice argument is false from the beginning. The fetus may not be a baby,

221
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,840
but if the pregnancy is left to its own devices it will likely become one with time. And if you

222
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,920
believe that humans have an innate value, and if you believe in universal human rights, you do

223
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,560
believe this, that is reason enough to protect the fetus. Even taking precautions from this

224
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,680
point of view is no excuse. Cause and effect still applies. The cause is unprotected sex,

225
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,840
and the effect is pregnancy. If you use contraceptives, that's a different set of cause

226
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:27,120
and effect. The protected sex is the cause, and the effect is no pregnancy. And if the contraceptives

227
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,480
fail, in that case the cause is failed protected sex, and the effect is pregnancy. The real world

228
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,960
still continues around you, regardless of whether or not you consent it to. Moreover, as medical

229
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,440
technology advances, the window of viability that the pro-choice position relies on will continue

230
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,760
to shrink. What will you do when advanced medical technology can make a child viable outside of the

231
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,440
womb at 18 weeks instead of 22? Or at 14 weeks? Or at 10? What will your reason for the denial

232
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,440
of human rights be then? On the other hand, the belief that human rights are granted at the moment

233
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,720
of conception is equally ridiculous. The exact moment a sperm cell touches an egg cell, there's

234
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,680
clearly no brain to even hold the thoughts of a new person. Many fertilized eggs are naturally

235
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,840
flushed out within a normal period as well, as they fail to naturally implant into the uterine

236
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,880
wall. Twins can generate from a duplication of the zygote from up to 14 days after conception.

237
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,480
If human rights begin at conception, because the point of conception is the creation of a new

238
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,440
person, then what is the legal status of twins? They were one person on day zero, and yet two

239
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,800
people on day 14. Does one twin own the other? If fetuses have human rights based not on their

240
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,200
current state, but on their potential to one day be a full human, why do we consider people with

241
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,000
irreversible brain damage to still be human and have human rights? Those people will never regain

242
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,560
the neurological traits that personhood relies on. Hell, forget the science. A lot of pro-lifers use

243
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,680
religious belief as their justification. Okay, let's do that. Leviticus 27 6. And if it be from

244
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:53,840
a month old even unto five years old, that thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of

245
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,800
silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. A child has no value if

246
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:04,160
it's under one month old, not 22 weeks after conception, not at birth, but one month after

247
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,840
birth. Numbers 3 15 to 16. Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers by their

248
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,680
families. Every male from a month old and upward, shalt thou number them. And Moses numbered them

249
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,240
according to the word of the Lord. Infants less than again one month old are not to be counted

250
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,800
as people. Exodus 21 22 to 23. If men strive and hurt a woman with child so that her fruit depart

251
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,120
from her, and yet no mischief follow, he shall surely be punished, according to the woman's

252
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,840
husband will lay upon him, and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow,

253
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,560
then thou shalt give life for life. Inducing a miscarriage by inflicting violence on a pregnant

254
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,120
woman, but committing no crime beyond that, is not considered to be a murder. Rather the husband has

255
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,040
leave to assault the man and the judges have leave to fine him, but this is not the biblical

256
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,760
punishment for murder. It seems to me that even in the Bible life does not begin at conception.

257
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,640
Oh, so that's the abortion argument as far as I can tell. Summed up for you in a nice little

258
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,240
package. Well, there was nothing little about it. That was a lot of information to get through.

259
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,920
And we haven't even discussed the abortion paradox yet. Let me remind you what the abortion

260
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,160
paradox is again. If we value equal rights between men and women, we either need to ban

261
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,720
all access to abortion or dismantle the child support system. Because if one gender has an

262
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,480
easy out from the responsibility of pregnancy, then in the name of equality, both genders must

263
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,800
have an easy out. Hey, now that we've heard it a second time, it sounds pretty familiar,

264
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,280
doesn't it? Oh, that's right. It's very similar to the pro-choice equality argument. If men can

265
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,360
have sex without fear of getting pregnant, then women must also have the fear of pregnancy removed

266
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,880
from the equation in the name of equality and sexual liberation. And remember our good friend,

267
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,360
Dr. Chambers, equality demands that society, culture and technology fill the gaps where

268
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,480
biology fails. As it turns out, the development of the abortion paradox unfolded almost like an

269
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,880
arms race between men and women. In a purely biological sense, for the gender of the species

270
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,440
that carries young or performs a disproportionate amount of the child rearing, sex carries a larger

271
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,080
risk. And when a feminist tells you that's not fair, they're right. It's not fair. It's not how

272
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,240
I would have arranged things if I were omnipotent, but here we are. Institutions like monogamy,

273
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,880
marriage, the pressure on men to provide for a family, these were all, as Dr. Chambers put it,

274
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,600
ways that culture filled the gaps where biology failed. They allowed men to take an equal yet

275
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,600
distinct role in the parenting of their kids. But what happens when one of the two parents don't

276
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,520
want to be a parent? Well, that's where the arms race kicks off. If the man doesn't want to be a

277
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,000
father and simply bolts, leaving the woman holding the bag, that's no good. There's still a child

278
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,080
that needs providing for. This is why we invented the concept of child support so that the woman

279
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,840
isn't simply left struggling with a kid she can't hope to raise on her own. And for a while,

280
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,160
that solution made sense. But does it still? With birth control and abortion an option,

281
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,560
does child support still make sense? If we do away with child support, who will help pay for

282
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,160
the child's upbringing? Well, to begin with, if the first half of this video has taught you

283
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,840
anything, it's that the abortion debate is far from settled. If the prime argument for the

284
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,280
abolition of child support is that women can get an abortion, that's a pretty poor argument,

285
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,120
considering the ever-increasing number of restrictions placed on abortion in the USA.

286
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,160
Even if it's legal, it's not commonly available. So let's assume a reproductively ideal world.

287
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,040
In this world, public education is sufficient that everyone knows the dangers of sex. Contraception

288
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,840
is available to all people who want it, for free, as part of a state healthcare program and is both

289
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,360
easy to get and easy to use. Abortions are in the same boat. In this ideal world, would it be

290
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,240
unjust to charge men child support if only the woman wanted a child? Well, some old guard

291
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,080
feminists think it would be unjust. A famous quote from Karen DeCrow reads,

292
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,800
If a woman makes a unilateral decision to bring a pregnancy to term, and the biological father does

293
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,760
not and cannot share in this decision, he should not be liable for 21 years of support. Autonomous

294
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,360
women making independent decisions about their lives should not expect men to finance their

295
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,600
choice. And this is a great point. If women are no longer bound to the home and hearth like

296
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,520
eras past, but can now provide for themselves and their children with the fruits of their own labor,

297
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,800
and every option to bail out of a pregnancy is provided to women,

298
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,760
why should we force a man to finance their unilateral decision?

299
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,040
This was basically the question asked in that child free thread from before,

300
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,280
and the comments do yield some interesting answers.

301
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,440
The courts try not to side with either mom or dad. They try to always side with the kid.

302
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,160
The two adults in this situation don't matter. They're adults who can take care of themselves.

303
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,720
Kids are vulnerable, and at the mercy of their parents. It's not that the non-custodial parent

304
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,040
owes child support as punishment for their choice to have sex. The idea is that the child deserves

305
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,120
to be provided for regardless of the circumstances of the parent's relationship. The argument put

306
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,120
forward is that the child's right to be provided for trumps the rights of either adult. That's not

307
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,200
an unreasonable argument, but it is quite convenient that because of this argument,

308
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,360
once the contraceptive and abortion arguments are finally permanently settled in the way that the

309
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,360
radical left wants them to be settled, that this position will result in men routinely getting

310
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,360
thrown under the bus. As it is right now, both genders are getting thrown under the bus, which

311
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,400
is equal but bad. And the only ways people are working to improve the situation seem to only be

312
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,600
improving women's a lot, not men's. The unfortunate truth is that there are biological differences

313
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,600
that warrant a nuanced and meandering legal framework in order to have a somewhat fair

314
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,560
outcome for the parties involved. What we have right now isn't really fair, but our biology isn't

315
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,200
fair, so the law attempts to accommodate. Women must retain exclusive rights to their bodies full

316
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,120
stop. Children must be cared for full stop. I don't really like the idea of people being

317
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,840
financially saddled for 18 years, but right now there is no other reliable system in place to

318
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,920
make sure that the children are provided for. Oh, biology isn't fair, eh? Whatever happened to

319
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:21,040
society, culture, and technology must fill the gaps where biology fails. That feminist precept

320
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,520
was used to justify birth control and abortion, but once it's men's biology failing them,

321
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,520
suddenly biology isn't fair so we just gotta live with it? What if abortions are made entirely

322
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,520
illegal and you're just told that biology isn't fair? Will you be happy with that?

323
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,120
There's a lot of shit that isn't fair for women, I assure you, so I don't have a ton of patience

324
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,120
for guys who moan about child support for a result they knew was a possibility going into sex,

325
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,800
shrug. There's a lot of shit that isn't fair for men, I assure you, so I don't have a ton

326
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,160
of patience for girls who moan about pregnancy as a result they knew was a possibility going

327
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,960
into sex, shrug. See how sexist that sounds? The excuse of don't have sex if you don't want to pay

328
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,040
child support to men is identical to don't have sex if you don't want to get pregnant to women,

329
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,680
and we decided that was grossly inappropriate long ago. If you are a man, by consenting to sex

330
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,000
you are basically signing a contract that you are allowing a woman and her body to use your DNA

331
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,240
how she sees fit. I'm gonna stop you right there. So does that include when you blow your load in a

332
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,280
condom and then the girl takes it and pours in her vag? Does that include that? Does that include

333
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,160
women sneaking into sperm banks and impregnating themselves? Does that include underage boys who

334
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,920
are raped by their female teachers? You know those MGTOW idiots? Yeah, the male isolationists

335
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,920
that believe that any contact with a woman, however casual, is just too dangerous for them

336
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,160
to risk? You're basically making their argument for them. The law isn't designed so that women

337
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,000
have the right to not be parents, it's designed so that they have the right to say what happens

338
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,520
to their body, and the fact that medically speaking this also allows women to choose

339
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,960
not to be a parent is an unintended and admittedly unfair consequence. Once all bodily autonomy

340
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,360
questions have been resolved, what is best for the child is tantamount, in this case two

341
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,640
financially supportive parents. And here is where we get to the ultimate hole in the what's best for

342
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,520
the kid argument. Some people advocate for what has come to be known as financial abortion for men,

343
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,120
that just like how women can get a physical abortion, men can simply opt out of parenthood,

344
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,600
lose all rights, lose all responsibilities, not have to pay child support and walk away from the

345
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,400
whole situation scot-free, just like how it seems that women can walk away from the whole situation

346
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,960
also scot-free. But a lot of these commenters in this thread are right when they say that physical

347
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,640
abortion for women and financial abortion for men are not parallel concepts. A physical abortion

348
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,960
means that there's no child to care for by either party when the deed is done. A financial abortion

349
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,560
means that the woman is still left with the financial burden of raising a kid by herself,

350
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:42,640
even in a reproductively ideal world. Even if the man met all reasonable time frames for filing for

351
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,680
a hypothetical financial abortion, at the end of the day a kid still exists, and therefore the

352
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,680
financial abortion idea is not an equivalent solution to the physical abortions currently

353
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,440
available. You know, if only we had a really easy way to figure out this whole scenario,

354
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,920
if only women had a way to unilaterally sever all their rights and responsibilities to their newborn

355
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,520
child, including the right of financial responsibility, the same way that financial

356
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,240
abortions advocate for men. If that were the case, then giving that option to simply walk away from

357
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,760
their kids would not only be possible, it would be necessary if we value equality. Oh wait, we do

358
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,800
have that. It's called safe haven laws. Safe haven laws allow mothers of newborn children to

359
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,160
give up their kids to the government. These children become wards of the state, and the

360
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,240
mother is allowed to remain nameless within the court. The mother waives all rights to the child,

361
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,600
but is also no longer burdened by responsibility, including financial responsibility. Not only do

362
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,440
safe haven laws allow mothers to duck their obligation to actually pay for their child's

363
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,760
upbringing, it also provides a vehicle for mothers who may wish to hide the existence of their child

364
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:45,520
from their father for good or bad reasons to do so with the assistance of the legal system.

365
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,400
This sounds a lot more like a female equivalent of the financial abortion for men argument than

366
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,200
physical abortions ever will be. If the law truly prioritized the rights of the child to be provided

367
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,920
for by the fruits of the parents' labors over either parent's own rights, then safe haven laws

368
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,840
wouldn't exist. Women would not be allowed to simply give up their kids and move on,

369
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,160
unburdened with responsibility, but they can. Despite men not being allowed to do so,

370
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,880
and despite everybody bending over fucking backwards to try and justify that, women can,

371
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,640
and do. In the end, I don't think the abortion paradox is about abortion at all.

372
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,960
The question, why can't men opt out of child support if women can get abortions, is a

373
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,200
nonsensical question, because it's comparing two separate, distinct, and ultimately unrelated

374
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,920
issues. The real question is why can't men opt out of child support if women can opt out of

375
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,800
supporting their child? And for that, there's no answer. Maybe it's because society values men's

376
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,800
rights less than women's. I mean, women's movements have become legitimized, and men's

377
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,440
movements have been laughed at. Maybe it's because men generally tend to work harder and longer than

378
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,680
women on average, and society requires some sort of incentive in order to keep them going.

379
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,160
And if being the respected and loved head of a nuclear family no longer functions as a suitable

380
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,000
carrot, then the government is required to fashion a suitable stick to get the job done.

381
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,080
Maybe it's because our culture is more willing to accept the idea that a man would instantly

382
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,920
abandon his child if given the opportunity than accept the idea that a woman would do the same.

383
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,840
Or maybe it's because people just generally don't think of the double standards that exist

384
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,600
when women can give up their children but men cannot. All in all, the childfree subreddit

385
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,280
is an interesting place. It gets a lot of undeserved hatred from a lot of people who

386
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,800
assume that the place exists solely to get off on the deaths of babies or something.

387
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,040
But it's not that at all. It's a mostly rational corner of the internet where a politically diverse

388
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,040
group of people come together based on their shared desire to never reproduce. Some left-leaning

389
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,920
people have feminist reasons, some right-leaning people have MRA reasons, but most people just have

390
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,240
individualist reasons for not wanting kids. And there's also a lot of overlap politically too.

391
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,560
Like I said before, the bodily autonomists are strangely pro-mandatory vaccination sometimes,

392
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,320
but there's more to it than that. For example, a lot of people who are normally pro-universal

393
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,040
social safety net often like to chastise overbreeding moms who suck up tax dollars

394
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,880
in the form of child-based subsidies. In any case, the sub's got a lot of great people in it.

395
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,320
Oh yeah, having to pay some fee for a few years is way worse than possibly being forced by stupid

396
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,880
misogynist laws to carry an unwanted fetus to term, go through life disruption, the agony,

397
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,160
the risk of fucking death. Poor men. Well, every community has got its bad apples.

398
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,120
Don't worry lady, if you just want to baselessly man-hate,

399
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,960
there's a ton of reddit subs out there just for you. It's not hate speech after all.
