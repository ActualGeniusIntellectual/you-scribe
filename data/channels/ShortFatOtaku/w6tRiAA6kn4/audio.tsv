0	5120	So I sometimes surf the childfree subreddit. I'm not really active there, but I have had
5120	9120	some friends post a couple of stories about me. For those of you who don't know, the childfree
9120	12480	subreddit is a community for people who have chosen to never have children, not because
12480	16240	they're infertile, but because they just don't want to do it. Personally, I don't really want
16240	20080	kids either, but I don't hate people that do. I just think it's a good idea that those who
20080	24240	want kids only have them when they're prepared for them. It's a very left-leaning subreddit
24240	28560	politically, and that's to be expected. In the past, men not having children wasn't
28560	32480	necessarily seen as abnormal, though it was expected that they would eventually have them.
32480	36720	However, with women, it has almost never been acceptable to not have kids, and it's really
36720	41360	only with moderate second-wave feminism that the social acceptability of deliberate childlessness
41360	44960	on a woman's part was even discussed. So the community has a lot of leftists,
44960	49760	a lot of feminists, many of them the sane liberal type, but there's a few radical crazies too.
49760	53680	At the same time though, there's also a contingent of politically right-leaning users as well.
53680	58000	The idea of purposefully not having children is not only grounded philosophically in the
58000	61520	second-wave feminist value of allowing women to have control over their own reproduction,
61520	65680	but it's also equally grounded in the male reaction to a society that has stripped all
65680	69920	incentive to reproduce from them. It's no secret that divorce courts, child support rulings,
69920	74000	and custody battles are all heavily weighted against the father, just like it's no secret
74000	78080	that a woman's option to not reproduce has socially never really been available until
78080	82400	very recently. Parenting is a biological investment for the mother, but it's a financial
82400	86160	investment for the father, and more people than ever on either side of the aisle are simply
86160	89840	considering the price to be too high. I'm getting into this because I want to establish
89840	94080	that the childfree subreddit is bipartisan in its membership. It's not exclusively full of
94080	97920	radical feminist women who masturbate to the ideas of the destruction of the nuclear family,
97920	102240	and it's also not exclusively full of MGTOW men who delusionally believe that they're a
102240	106400	prime target of spermjacking by any woman they ever meet. But just because the subreddit is
106400	111440	bipartisan doesn't mean that it's apolitical. Some people on both sides of the gender argument
111440	115360	find themselves radicalized and therefore at odds with each other. Despite agreeing on the
115360	120800	childfree question. A recent example of this is a thread titled I'm glad I'm female because no
120800	125520	one will ever have my child without my consent and then force me to pay child support on top of that.
125520	129440	The thread is now locked, and it's a perfect example of the childfree political schism.
129440	134160	Recently I read a post on this subreddit where OP's wife had tubal litigation but it failed and
134160	138560	she became pregnant. His wife was against abortion so she wanted to keep and raise the child. OP
138560	142480	decided to divorce and was upset about everyone judging him for wanting to divorce his wife over
142480	145920	the child and wanting to avoid paying child support. I was surprised to read the comments
145920	150160	below. Many of them suggested that OP was being the shit of the earth for not wanting to pay child
150160	154000	support for a child he didn't want, had taken reasonable steps to avoid the creation of,
154000	158240	and whose continued existence was being championed only by his wife and his judgmental parents and
158240	161840	friends. I understand that people should be responsible for kids they have willingly or
161840	166320	irresponsibly created, but in this case why the heck should OP be responsible and forced to
166320	170960	literally pay for his wife's refusal to abort or give up an accidental pregnancy for adoption?
170960	174720	Can someone explain to me why, if no one's allowed to prevent me from getting an abortion
174720	178640	or force me into getting one, why I'm allowed to force a guy to pay for a child if he's made
178640	182960	it clear he doesn't want it, but I made it exist anyway? I don't feel safe about my own reproductive
182960	187200	rights if there's this gaping hole in the opposite genders. Obviously guys shouldn't be allowed to
187200	191360	force women to get abortions, no shit, but why should they be financially burdened or obligated
191360	195440	afterwards? We give women the final choice in terms of a child's existence, and we just force
195440	199360	men to be responsible for her choice either way, regardless of his own feelings on the matter?
199360	203360	I feel like men have an obligation to help pay for an abortion procedure since the pregnancy
203360	206800	is partially his responsibility, but the continuation of that pregnancy is all in the
206800	210720	woman, since she has the final authority over the matter. This is a prime example of what I
210720	215520	would like to call the abortion paradox, that if we value equal rights between men and women,
215520	220400	we either need to ban all access to abortion or dismantle the child support system, because if
220400	224560	one gender has an easy out from the responsibility of pregnancy, then in the name of equality,
224560	228720	both genders must have an easy out. I'm going to attempt to present all sides of the abortion
228720	231840	paradox as objectively as I can, and let's see what we can make out of it.
231840	235520	First of all, we can't discuss the abortion paradox without discussing abortion itself.
235520	240480	The abortion paradox assumes that abortion, in a vacuum, without adding other connected problems
240480	245280	into the mix, should be a legal option for women. But there's still no consensus on that.
245280	248880	Some people are just fine with abortion, some people would never get one themselves but are
248880	253040	okay with it being legal, and some people want abortion to be illegal, with that illegality
253040	257360	having some exceptions or no exceptions at all. There's a range of opinions. The pro-choice side
257360	261120	of the argument believes that abortions should be legal. Their argument generally stems from
261120	266800	three positions. A, the equality argument. B, the lack of personhood rights argument.
266800	270960	And C, the bodily autonomy argument. The first one, the equality argument,
270960	275600	is ideological in nature, and has been described by several feminist authors, most notably bell
275600	279840	hooks, as the following. If men can have sex without fear of getting pregnant, then women
279840	283840	must also have the fear of pregnancy removed from the equation, in the name of equality and sexual
283840	287360	liberation. This point of view spurred the legality of the birth control pill, as well as
287360	291360	abortion access, in order to ensure that no woman carries a fetus to term except the ones that she
291360	295600	explicitly wants to. I can't back up this next statement, so take it with a grain of salt, but
295600	300000	Dr. Laurie Chambers, the chair of the gender studies department at Lakehead University,
300000	304400	explained this concept in her own words in one of her lectures. That even though biological
304400	308480	differences in reproductive systems create a disproportionate amount of risk for women when
308480	313440	engaging in sexual activity, Dr. Chambers asserted that equality demands that society,
313440	318800	culture, and technology fill the gaps where biology fails. The second argument, lack of
318800	322640	personhood, revolves around the status of the zygote or the fetus. It's clear that when a
322640	327120	pregnancy event unfolds properly, a fertilized embryo eventually becomes a baby with human
327120	331600	rights. The pro-choice position is generally that the fetus is not a person up until it's viable
331600	335520	outside of the womb, with some pro-choice extremists outright stating that the fetus
335520	339600	is not a person until natural birth has occurred. And this is why most countries with legal
339600	343680	abortions have a 20-22 week cutoff period for having the procedure. Before this time,
343680	348240	the fetus is not a person, therefore it has no human rights, and therefore abortion is not
348240	352560	murder. The Supreme Court decision Roe vs Wade, which legalized abortion in the US,
352560	357120	has a passage that reads, the state's interest in the life of the fetus became compelling only
357120	361200	at the point of viability, defined as the point at which the fetus can survive independently from
361200	365280	its mother. Let's discuss the third option, bodily autonomy rights. The right for a person
365280	369200	to determine what happens with their own bodies without interference from the state. The pro-choice
369200	373760	position holds that a woman has the choice to abort or not abort based on these bodily
373760	378240	autonomy rights. The bodily autonomy argument generally takes two different forms. The first
378240	381840	revolves around the woman giving consent for another being to draw sustenance from her body.
381840	385520	This point of view supposes that just like a woman may choose to breastfeed or not, a woman may
385520	390160	choose to nourish a fetus through the umbilical cord or not. As both actions take away energy
390160	394080	from the woman, energy which she may desire to keep for herself. And just like a woman may
394080	398080	remove a parasitic tape-form that's suckling nutrients out through her intestine, she can
398080	402400	also remove a zygote that's suckling nutrients out through her uterine lining. The second form
402400	407360	of the bodily autonomy argument involves foreign bodies penetrating into, or existing inside of,
407360	411920	a person's body. As a society, we generally view violations of the integrity of somebody else's
411920	417120	body as a serious crime. An obvious example is the illegality of rape, but other non-sexual forms
417120	422240	of forced foreign object insertion is generally also illegal. For example, tattooing or branding
422240	426720	somebody against their will is not only a serious crime, it can even be a human rights violation.
426720	431200	The bodily autonomy argument, insofar as abortion is concerned, posits that a woman's bodily
431200	435920	autonomy is violated when she has an undesired pregnancy. This violation can stem from her sexual
435920	440560	partner, the fetus, or both, and that therefore abortion rights are necessary to maintain her
440560	445040	bodily autonomy rights. Notice that the lack of personhood argument maintains that the fetus is
445040	449840	not a person and therefore has no rights, while the bodily autonomy argument can be seen as an
449840	454640	implicit acceptance of a fetus's human rights. If a fetus is a person, and it has human rights,
454640	458880	it therefore also has responsibilities. And if we are to take the fetus's actions against the
458880	462960	incubating woman as an assault on her bodily autonomy, then that is actually a serious crime
462960	467440	on the fetus's part, even if the fetus is doing it unintentionally. We generally do consider
467440	471360	unintentional crimes to still be crimes if they're serious enough, even when they're committed by
471360	475840	children. In this case, abortion may even be seen as a form of capital punishment against the
475840	496960	invader, or hell, maybe an eviction. Yes, I used this joke earlier during the Ben Shapiro at
496960	501280	Berkeley video, it was too good to pass up. In any case, the fact that the pro-choice arguments use
501280	506640	both a fetus's human rights and simultaneously a denial of those rights as arguments may seem
506640	510960	inconsistent on their part, but it also may simply be preparedness for any possibility.
510960	514880	On the pro-life side of the argument, people believe that abortion should be illegal.
514880	519440	Their argument generally stem from two positions. A, the responsibility argument,
519440	524080	and B, the sanctity of life argument. The responsibility argument is ideological in
524080	528320	nature, like its pro-choice variant. It states that consenting to sex is the same thing as
528320	532640	consenting to pregnancy and motherhood. They're linked by cause and effect. Having an abortion
532640	536960	is therefore a ducking responsibility for one's actions. The sanctity of life argument is a bit
536960	541440	more complex. It is generally a religious argument revolving around the uniqueness of humanity and
541440	545280	the existence of a soul, but there is also a humanist component to it, where the moral
545280	549520	authority comes not from religious belief, but from a reverence for sentient life. It's from
549520	554000	this reverence that a non-religious concept of universal human rights also springs. In either
554000	557760	case, the sanctity of life argument is fundamentally a moral argument revolving
557760	561920	around the status of the fetus or zygote as a person and therefore having human rights.
561920	566240	For example, some pro-lifers argue that abortions discriminate against people that have been
566240	571440	conceived but not yet born, and that abortion advocates do not actually value all human life,
571440	574640	only forms of human life that have reached a specific level of development.
574640	578560	If we can arbitrarily declare somebody to not have human rights based on their age,
578560	583920	why is it 22 weeks of gestation instead of 10, or 30, or one year old? It seems rather arbitrary.
583920	587920	Some people argue that abortions deprive a fetus of a future, a future that may be fulfilling,
587920	591680	pleasurable, or in some other way positive. This argument is the same as one of the principle
591680	595360	arguments against murder as well. A murderer deprives the victim of the experiences that
595360	599600	the rest of their lives may have held. So too does abortion. This argument often comes in the
599600	603760	simpler form of, what if your baby is the next Einstein, referring to the possibility that the
603760	607920	fetus may grow into somebody who positively impacts the world in some way. Some people argue
607920	612080	from safety that because we do not know when a fetus or a zygote becomes a person with human
612080	616480	rights, we need to assume that all fetuses and all zygotes have human rights even if it later
616480	620320	turns out that they don't, much the same way that reckless behavior that may cause the death of
620320	624800	another person is considered to be both morally and legally wrong even if nobody actually died
624800	628640	as a result of the reckless behavior. All of these arguments are derived from the concept of
628640	633200	universal human rights, with that universality also extending to fetuses and zygotes and not
633200	637440	just already born humans. There's a few other fringe pro-life arguments that we can dismiss
637440	641760	right here. Some people claim that abortion causes a post-abortion shock syndrome, that
641760	645920	abortions routinely cause infertility, and that even at a proper medical facility with trained
645920	649600	staff abortions are extremely unsafe. None of these are true and the evidence against them is
649600	653200	so overwhelming I won't waste any more time on it. So there we go, we've got the pro-life side,
653200	657200	we've got the pro-choice side, and we've got their arguments. And all the arguments on both
657200	662080	sides ultimately hinge on human rights. Let's see if we can poke holes in any of these arguments.
662080	665600	And yes, I'm doing it to both sides. So if you're currently in the middle of writing an angry
665600	669840	comment at least wait until the video is done, okay? The bodily autonomy argument is probably
669840	674400	the strongest one in the pro-choice camp. Even if the fetus or zygote has personhood rights,
674400	678640	which person's rights do you prioritize? The woman's or the child's? I mean, a woman can
678640	682720	always have more children later when she's more ready to do so. It may sound harsh, but it was
682720	687280	often the case in humanity's past, and is absolutely the case in the animal kingdom at large,
687280	691200	that a mother will abandon her child in a moment of extreme weakness or danger because at least
691200	694960	she will still be allowed to reproduce later. It's a sound evolutionary strategy. But there
694960	700000	is a funny hypocrisy to it. Most pro-choice people are also pro-vaccination. My experience
700000	704080	on the child-free subreddit leads me to believe that a lot of pro-choice people routinely make
704080	709520	fun of insane anti-vaxx Facebook moms. And I'm not anti-vaccination myself. I think vaccinations
709520	714080	are obviously a good thing, but let's talk about rights here. Do bodily autonomy rights not also
714080	718720	include the right to not get a vaccination? Is a vaccination needle not also a foreign object?
718720	723680	It seems to be a huge contradiction to me that people who champion bodily autonomy so much
723680	727840	would also force people to get vaccinations if given the chance. And in that same vein,
727840	732080	a large chunk of the pro-choice crowd are also socialists or communists due to the increasingly
732080	736400	large crossover between feminist theory and Marxist theory. But bodily autonomy rights are
736400	741200	predicated on property rights. Your body is your property, just like your house or your car or
741200	746160	your belongings. If society becomes collectivized, where the group owns the property, why do you
746160	750000	think you'd still have abortion rights? Why do you think you'd have any bodily autonomy rights
750000	754560	at all? There's a reason that abortion rights are a thing only in capitalist societies. Because
754560	759680	only capitalists recognize property as owned by individuals, and only capitalists view individual
759680	764400	rights, bodies and all, as meaningful. The pro-life responsibility argument is also a
764400	769040	walking contradiction. It makes no sense to demand that a woman must not take advantage of the latest
769040	773040	medical technology and have a safe abortion, and instead must take responsibility for her actions
773040	776720	by having the child she's conceived, when the history of human technological development has
776720	780960	been entirely based on the objective of reducing the amount of responsibility that people take in
780960	785440	their lives. The hunter-gatherer had a greater responsibility to hunt and gather than the farmer
785440	790320	had to farm. When humanity started building walls around their cities, the danger of attack by
790320	794640	either predators or neighboring humans also shrunk. People could walk around at night safer
794640	798960	than before, with less responsibility laid in on them to protect themselves. Medicine,
798960	804560	transportation, trade, it all serves to reduce risk and increase reward. And subsequently,
804560	808320	individual people have less responsibility to deal with. Saying that somebody should get
808320	811120	an abortion because they should take responsibility for what they've done,
811120	814880	is like saying you shouldn't pull your parachute during a skydive because you should take
814880	819120	responsibility for the earth rapidly rushing towards you. There's just no reason to do so,
819120	823840	and our entire civilization is structured against that idea. Some pro-choice people routinely argue
823840	828560	from the exception. That is, they believe that exceptional circumstances should dictate the rules
828560	833360	for ordinary circumstances. A common tactic is to advocate for abortion rights only in instances
833360	837120	where the mother's life is in danger. From there, this exception is expanded to instances of rape,
837120	841200	and then to detectable birth defects. And then, once the door has been cracked open that much,
841200	844880	they advocate for abortion on demand, under the guise of protecting women's mental health.
844880	850400	This is clearly a disingenuous form of arguing. In no instance, abortion or anything else,
850400	854720	should the exceptional cases of a situation become the primary basis for legal statutes.
854720	859760	Exceptions to the rule are just that, exceptions, they are not the rule themselves. And an argument
859760	864400	for widespread abortion access cannot be based on exceptions. The pro-life position of making
864400	868880	abortion illegal comes with a host of other problems. It's no secret that illegally performed
868880	872720	abortions regularly kill women attempting to get them. And prohibition has taught us that when the
872720	876800	government makes illegal something that the population desires, it doesn't actually eliminate
876800	881680	the activity or product. And furthermore, what would society do with women who is caught getting
881680	885680	an illegal abortion? Would you go to jail for murder? Would the illicit doctor go to jail for
885680	890720	murder? If the doctor but not the woman, why not? If the fetus has human rights, how would this
890720	894560	situation be any different from a woman hiring a hitman to kill somebody? Surely she would be
894560	898960	liable somehow. There's also an argument from consequences to consider. America's downward
898960	904240	spike in crime during the 1990s occurred because abortion became legal in 1973, and all of the
904240	908320	children of low-income single mothers that would have grown up to be criminals were instead aborted.
908320	912960	But most importantly, how would a government even determine if an abortion has taken place?
912960	917360	We already have instances of some US states attempting to charge women for murder because
917360	920800	those women had a miscarriage and it was later discovered that they had been drinking or doing
920800	925280	drugs while pregnant. What if a woman has a natural miscarriage and she gets charged with
925280	930240	murder because she did something minorly unsafe, like drive her car to work, and the prosecutors
930240	934080	determined that she had put her child at undue risk? What if women who are not currently on
934080	938560	their period are simply legally considered to be potentially pregnant and are therefore barred from
938560	942960	doing any activity that may harm a potential child? Making abortion illegal leads us down
942960	947360	a slippery slope that ends with the liberty of women restricted so severely that we may as well
947360	951920	be living under Sharia law. And on the topic of whether or not a fetus or a zygote has human
951920	956240	rights, frankly both sides have done a shit job at arguing their positions. On one hand,
956240	960160	it's clear that the pro-choice argument is false from the beginning. The fetus may not be a baby,
960160	963840	but if the pregnancy is left to its own devices it will likely become one with time. And if you
963840	967920	believe that humans have an innate value, and if you believe in universal human rights, you do
967920	972560	believe this, that is reason enough to protect the fetus. Even taking precautions from this
972560	977680	point of view is no excuse. Cause and effect still applies. The cause is unprotected sex,
977680	981840	and the effect is pregnancy. If you use contraceptives, that's a different set of cause
981840	987120	and effect. The protected sex is the cause, and the effect is no pregnancy. And if the contraceptives
987120	992480	fail, in that case the cause is failed protected sex, and the effect is pregnancy. The real world
992480	996960	still continues around you, regardless of whether or not you consent it to. Moreover, as medical
996960	1001440	technology advances, the window of viability that the pro-choice position relies on will continue
1001440	1005760	to shrink. What will you do when advanced medical technology can make a child viable outside of the
1005760	1011440	womb at 18 weeks instead of 22? Or at 14 weeks? Or at 10? What will your reason for the denial
1011440	1015440	of human rights be then? On the other hand, the belief that human rights are granted at the moment
1015440	1020720	of conception is equally ridiculous. The exact moment a sperm cell touches an egg cell, there's
1020720	1025680	clearly no brain to even hold the thoughts of a new person. Many fertilized eggs are naturally
1025680	1029840	flushed out within a normal period as well, as they fail to naturally implant into the uterine
1029840	1034880	wall. Twins can generate from a duplication of the zygote from up to 14 days after conception.
1034880	1038480	If human rights begin at conception, because the point of conception is the creation of a new
1038480	1043440	person, then what is the legal status of twins? They were one person on day zero, and yet two
1043440	1048800	people on day 14. Does one twin own the other? If fetuses have human rights based not on their
1048800	1053200	current state, but on their potential to one day be a full human, why do we consider people with
1053200	1058000	irreversible brain damage to still be human and have human rights? Those people will never regain
1058000	1062560	the neurological traits that personhood relies on. Hell, forget the science. A lot of pro-lifers use
1062560	1067680	religious belief as their justification. Okay, let's do that. Leviticus 27 6. And if it be from
1067680	1073840	a month old even unto five years old, that thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of
1073840	1078800	silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. A child has no value if
1078800	1084160	it's under one month old, not 22 weeks after conception, not at birth, but one month after
1084160	1089840	birth. Numbers 3 15 to 16. Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers by their
1089840	1095680	families. Every male from a month old and upward, shalt thou number them. And Moses numbered them
1095680	1100240	according to the word of the Lord. Infants less than again one month old are not to be counted
1100240	1106800	as people. Exodus 21 22 to 23. If men strive and hurt a woman with child so that her fruit depart
1106800	1111120	from her, and yet no mischief follow, he shall surely be punished, according to the woman's
1111120	1115840	husband will lay upon him, and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow,
1115840	1120560	then thou shalt give life for life. Inducing a miscarriage by inflicting violence on a pregnant
1120560	1125120	woman, but committing no crime beyond that, is not considered to be a murder. Rather the husband has
1125120	1129040	leave to assault the man and the judges have leave to fine him, but this is not the biblical
1129040	1133760	punishment for murder. It seems to me that even in the Bible life does not begin at conception.
1133920	1138640	Oh, so that's the abortion argument as far as I can tell. Summed up for you in a nice little
1138640	1142240	package. Well, there was nothing little about it. That was a lot of information to get through.
1142240	1145920	And we haven't even discussed the abortion paradox yet. Let me remind you what the abortion
1145920	1150160	paradox is again. If we value equal rights between men and women, we either need to ban
1150160	1154720	all access to abortion or dismantle the child support system. Because if one gender has an
1154720	1158480	easy out from the responsibility of pregnancy, then in the name of equality, both genders must
1158480	1162800	have an easy out. Hey, now that we've heard it a second time, it sounds pretty familiar,
1162800	1167280	doesn't it? Oh, that's right. It's very similar to the pro-choice equality argument. If men can
1167280	1171360	have sex without fear of getting pregnant, then women must also have the fear of pregnancy removed
1171360	1174880	from the equation in the name of equality and sexual liberation. And remember our good friend,
1174880	1179360	Dr. Chambers, equality demands that society, culture and technology fill the gaps where
1179360	1184480	biology fails. As it turns out, the development of the abortion paradox unfolded almost like an
1184480	1188880	arms race between men and women. In a purely biological sense, for the gender of the species
1188880	1193440	that carries young or performs a disproportionate amount of the child rearing, sex carries a larger
1193440	1198080	risk. And when a feminist tells you that's not fair, they're right. It's not fair. It's not how
1198080	1202240	I would have arranged things if I were omnipotent, but here we are. Institutions like monogamy,
1202240	1206880	marriage, the pressure on men to provide for a family, these were all, as Dr. Chambers put it,
1206880	1211600	ways that culture filled the gaps where biology failed. They allowed men to take an equal yet
1211600	1215600	distinct role in the parenting of their kids. But what happens when one of the two parents don't
1215600	1219520	want to be a parent? Well, that's where the arms race kicks off. If the man doesn't want to be a
1219520	1224000	father and simply bolts, leaving the woman holding the bag, that's no good. There's still a child
1224000	1228080	that needs providing for. This is why we invented the concept of child support so that the woman
1228080	1231840	isn't simply left struggling with a kid she can't hope to raise on her own. And for a while,
1231840	1236160	that solution made sense. But does it still? With birth control and abortion an option,
1236160	1240560	does child support still make sense? If we do away with child support, who will help pay for
1240560	1244160	the child's upbringing? Well, to begin with, if the first half of this video has taught you
1244160	1247840	anything, it's that the abortion debate is far from settled. If the prime argument for the
1247840	1251280	abolition of child support is that women can get an abortion, that's a pretty poor argument,
1251280	1255120	considering the ever-increasing number of restrictions placed on abortion in the USA.
1255120	1260160	Even if it's legal, it's not commonly available. So let's assume a reproductively ideal world.
1260160	1265040	In this world, public education is sufficient that everyone knows the dangers of sex. Contraception
1265040	1269840	is available to all people who want it, for free, as part of a state healthcare program and is both
1269840	1275360	easy to get and easy to use. Abortions are in the same boat. In this ideal world, would it be
1275360	1280240	unjust to charge men child support if only the woman wanted a child? Well, some old guard
1280240	1284080	feminists think it would be unjust. A famous quote from Karen DeCrow reads,
1284080	1288800	If a woman makes a unilateral decision to bring a pregnancy to term, and the biological father does
1288800	1293760	not and cannot share in this decision, he should not be liable for 21 years of support. Autonomous
1293760	1297360	women making independent decisions about their lives should not expect men to finance their
1297440	1301600	choice. And this is a great point. If women are no longer bound to the home and hearth like
1301600	1305520	eras past, but can now provide for themselves and their children with the fruits of their own labor,
1305520	1308800	and every option to bail out of a pregnancy is provided to women,
1308800	1311760	why should we force a man to finance their unilateral decision?
1311760	1315040	This was basically the question asked in that child free thread from before,
1315040	1317280	and the comments do yield some interesting answers.
1317280	1321440	The courts try not to side with either mom or dad. They try to always side with the kid.
1321440	1326160	The two adults in this situation don't matter. They're adults who can take care of themselves.
1326160	1330720	Kids are vulnerable, and at the mercy of their parents. It's not that the non-custodial parent
1330720	1335040	owes child support as punishment for their choice to have sex. The idea is that the child deserves
1335040	1339120	to be provided for regardless of the circumstances of the parent's relationship. The argument put
1339120	1343120	forward is that the child's right to be provided for trumps the rights of either adult. That's not
1343120	1347200	an unreasonable argument, but it is quite convenient that because of this argument,
1347200	1351360	once the contraceptive and abortion arguments are finally permanently settled in the way that the
1351360	1355360	radical left wants them to be settled, that this position will result in men routinely getting
1355360	1359360	thrown under the bus. As it is right now, both genders are getting thrown under the bus, which
1359360	1364400	is equal but bad. And the only ways people are working to improve the situation seem to only be
1364400	1369600	improving women's a lot, not men's. The unfortunate truth is that there are biological differences
1369600	1373600	that warrant a nuanced and meandering legal framework in order to have a somewhat fair
1373600	1378560	outcome for the parties involved. What we have right now isn't really fair, but our biology isn't
1378560	1383200	fair, so the law attempts to accommodate. Women must retain exclusive rights to their bodies full
1383200	1387120	stop. Children must be cared for full stop. I don't really like the idea of people being
1387120	1391840	financially saddled for 18 years, but right now there is no other reliable system in place to
1391840	1395920	make sure that the children are provided for. Oh, biology isn't fair, eh? Whatever happened to
1395920	1401040	society, culture, and technology must fill the gaps where biology fails. That feminist precept
1401040	1405520	was used to justify birth control and abortion, but once it's men's biology failing them,
1405520	1409520	suddenly biology isn't fair so we just gotta live with it? What if abortions are made entirely
1409520	1413520	illegal and you're just told that biology isn't fair? Will you be happy with that?
1413520	1417120	There's a lot of shit that isn't fair for women, I assure you, so I don't have a ton of patience
1417120	1421120	for guys who moan about child support for a result they knew was a possibility going into sex,
1421120	1424800	shrug. There's a lot of shit that isn't fair for men, I assure you, so I don't have a ton
1424800	1428160	of patience for girls who moan about pregnancy as a result they knew was a possibility going
1428160	1432960	into sex, shrug. See how sexist that sounds? The excuse of don't have sex if you don't want to pay
1432960	1437040	child support to men is identical to don't have sex if you don't want to get pregnant to women,
1437040	1441680	and we decided that was grossly inappropriate long ago. If you are a man, by consenting to sex
1441680	1446000	you are basically signing a contract that you are allowing a woman and her body to use your DNA
1446000	1452240	how she sees fit. I'm gonna stop you right there. So does that include when you blow your load in a
1452240	1457280	condom and then the girl takes it and pours in her vag? Does that include that? Does that include
1457280	1462160	women sneaking into sperm banks and impregnating themselves? Does that include underage boys who
1462160	1467920	are raped by their female teachers? You know those MGTOW idiots? Yeah, the male isolationists
1467920	1471920	that believe that any contact with a woman, however casual, is just too dangerous for them
1471920	1476160	to risk? You're basically making their argument for them. The law isn't designed so that women
1476160	1480000	have the right to not be parents, it's designed so that they have the right to say what happens
1480000	1483520	to their body, and the fact that medically speaking this also allows women to choose
1483520	1488960	not to be a parent is an unintended and admittedly unfair consequence. Once all bodily autonomy
1488960	1493360	questions have been resolved, what is best for the child is tantamount, in this case two
1493360	1498640	financially supportive parents. And here is where we get to the ultimate hole in the what's best for
1498640	1503520	the kid argument. Some people advocate for what has come to be known as financial abortion for men,
1503520	1509120	that just like how women can get a physical abortion, men can simply opt out of parenthood,
1509120	1513600	lose all rights, lose all responsibilities, not have to pay child support and walk away from the
1513600	1518400	whole situation scot-free, just like how it seems that women can walk away from the whole situation
1518400	1522960	also scot-free. But a lot of these commenters in this thread are right when they say that physical
1522960	1528640	abortion for women and financial abortion for men are not parallel concepts. A physical abortion
1528640	1532960	means that there's no child to care for by either party when the deed is done. A financial abortion
1532960	1536560	means that the woman is still left with the financial burden of raising a kid by herself,
1536560	1542640	even in a reproductively ideal world. Even if the man met all reasonable time frames for filing for
1542640	1547680	a hypothetical financial abortion, at the end of the day a kid still exists, and therefore the
1547680	1551680	financial abortion idea is not an equivalent solution to the physical abortions currently
1551680	1555440	available. You know, if only we had a really easy way to figure out this whole scenario,
1555440	1559920	if only women had a way to unilaterally sever all their rights and responsibilities to their newborn
1559920	1563520	child, including the right of financial responsibility, the same way that financial
1563520	1568240	abortions advocate for men. If that were the case, then giving that option to simply walk away from
1568240	1573760	their kids would not only be possible, it would be necessary if we value equality. Oh wait, we do
1573760	1578800	have that. It's called safe haven laws. Safe haven laws allow mothers of newborn children to
1578800	1582160	give up their kids to the government. These children become wards of the state, and the
1582160	1586240	mother is allowed to remain nameless within the court. The mother waives all rights to the child,
1586240	1591600	but is also no longer burdened by responsibility, including financial responsibility. Not only do
1591600	1595440	safe haven laws allow mothers to duck their obligation to actually pay for their child's
1595440	1599760	upbringing, it also provides a vehicle for mothers who may wish to hide the existence of their child
1599760	1605520	from their father for good or bad reasons to do so with the assistance of the legal system.
1605520	1610400	This sounds a lot more like a female equivalent of the financial abortion for men argument than
1610400	1615200	physical abortions ever will be. If the law truly prioritized the rights of the child to be provided
1615200	1619920	for by the fruits of the parents' labors over either parent's own rights, then safe haven laws
1619920	1623840	wouldn't exist. Women would not be allowed to simply give up their kids and move on,
1623840	1628160	unburdened with responsibility, but they can. Despite men not being allowed to do so,
1628160	1632880	and despite everybody bending over fucking backwards to try and justify that, women can,
1632880	1636640	and do. In the end, I don't think the abortion paradox is about abortion at all.
1636640	1640960	The question, why can't men opt out of child support if women can get abortions, is a
1640960	1645200	nonsensical question, because it's comparing two separate, distinct, and ultimately unrelated
1645200	1649920	issues. The real question is why can't men opt out of child support if women can opt out of
1649920	1654800	supporting their child? And for that, there's no answer. Maybe it's because society values men's
1654800	1658800	rights less than women's. I mean, women's movements have become legitimized, and men's
1658800	1663440	movements have been laughed at. Maybe it's because men generally tend to work harder and longer than
1663440	1667680	women on average, and society requires some sort of incentive in order to keep them going.
1667680	1672160	And if being the respected and loved head of a nuclear family no longer functions as a suitable
1672160	1676000	carrot, then the government is required to fashion a suitable stick to get the job done.
1676000	1680080	Maybe it's because our culture is more willing to accept the idea that a man would instantly
1680080	1683920	abandon his child if given the opportunity than accept the idea that a woman would do the same.
1683920	1687840	Or maybe it's because people just generally don't think of the double standards that exist
1687840	1691600	when women can give up their children but men cannot. All in all, the childfree subreddit
1691600	1695280	is an interesting place. It gets a lot of undeserved hatred from a lot of people who
1695280	1698800	assume that the place exists solely to get off on the deaths of babies or something.
1698800	1703040	But it's not that at all. It's a mostly rational corner of the internet where a politically diverse
1703040	1707040	group of people come together based on their shared desire to never reproduce. Some left-leaning
1707040	1711920	people have feminist reasons, some right-leaning people have MRA reasons, but most people just have
1711920	1716240	individualist reasons for not wanting kids. And there's also a lot of overlap politically too.
1716240	1720560	Like I said before, the bodily autonomists are strangely pro-mandatory vaccination sometimes,
1720560	1724320	but there's more to it than that. For example, a lot of people who are normally pro-universal
1724320	1729040	social safety net often like to chastise overbreeding moms who suck up tax dollars
1729040	1732880	in the form of child-based subsidies. In any case, the sub's got a lot of great people in it.
1732880	1738320	Oh yeah, having to pay some fee for a few years is way worse than possibly being forced by stupid
1738320	1742880	misogynist laws to carry an unwanted fetus to term, go through life disruption, the agony,
1742880	1748160	the risk of fucking death. Poor men. Well, every community has got its bad apples.
1748160	1751120	Don't worry lady, if you just want to baselessly man-hate,
1751120	1754960	there's a ton of reddit subs out there just for you. It's not hate speech after all.
