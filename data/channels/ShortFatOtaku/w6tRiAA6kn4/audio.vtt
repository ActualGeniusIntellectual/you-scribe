WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
So I sometimes surf the childfree subreddit. I'm not really active there, but I have had

00:05.120 --> 00:09.120
some friends post a couple of stories about me. For those of you who don't know, the childfree

00:09.120 --> 00:12.480
subreddit is a community for people who have chosen to never have children, not because

00:12.480 --> 00:16.240
they're infertile, but because they just don't want to do it. Personally, I don't really want

00:16.240 --> 00:20.080
kids either, but I don't hate people that do. I just think it's a good idea that those who

00:20.080 --> 00:24.240
want kids only have them when they're prepared for them. It's a very left-leaning subreddit

00:24.240 --> 00:28.560
politically, and that's to be expected. In the past, men not having children wasn't

00:28.560 --> 00:32.480
necessarily seen as abnormal, though it was expected that they would eventually have them.

00:32.480 --> 00:36.720
However, with women, it has almost never been acceptable to not have kids, and it's really

00:36.720 --> 00:41.360
only with moderate second-wave feminism that the social acceptability of deliberate childlessness

00:41.360 --> 00:44.960
on a woman's part was even discussed. So the community has a lot of leftists,

00:44.960 --> 00:49.760
a lot of feminists, many of them the sane liberal type, but there's a few radical crazies too.

00:49.760 --> 00:53.680
At the same time though, there's also a contingent of politically right-leaning users as well.

00:53.680 --> 00:58.000
The idea of purposefully not having children is not only grounded philosophically in the

00:58.000 --> 01:01.520
second-wave feminist value of allowing women to have control over their own reproduction,

01:01.520 --> 01:05.680
but it's also equally grounded in the male reaction to a society that has stripped all

01:05.680 --> 01:09.920
incentive to reproduce from them. It's no secret that divorce courts, child support rulings,

01:09.920 --> 01:14.000
and custody battles are all heavily weighted against the father, just like it's no secret

01:14.000 --> 01:18.080
that a woman's option to not reproduce has socially never really been available until

01:18.080 --> 01:22.400
very recently. Parenting is a biological investment for the mother, but it's a financial

01:22.400 --> 01:26.160
investment for the father, and more people than ever on either side of the aisle are simply

01:26.160 --> 01:29.840
considering the price to be too high. I'm getting into this because I want to establish

01:29.840 --> 01:34.080
that the childfree subreddit is bipartisan in its membership. It's not exclusively full of

01:34.080 --> 01:37.920
radical feminist women who masturbate to the ideas of the destruction of the nuclear family,

01:37.920 --> 01:42.240
and it's also not exclusively full of MGTOW men who delusionally believe that they're a

01:42.240 --> 01:46.400
prime target of spermjacking by any woman they ever meet. But just because the subreddit is

01:46.400 --> 01:51.440
bipartisan doesn't mean that it's apolitical. Some people on both sides of the gender argument

01:51.440 --> 01:55.360
find themselves radicalized and therefore at odds with each other. Despite agreeing on the

01:55.360 --> 02:00.800
childfree question. A recent example of this is a thread titled I'm glad I'm female because no

02:00.800 --> 02:05.520
one will ever have my child without my consent and then force me to pay child support on top of that.

02:05.520 --> 02:09.440
The thread is now locked, and it's a perfect example of the childfree political schism.

02:09.440 --> 02:14.160
Recently I read a post on this subreddit where OP's wife had tubal litigation but it failed and

02:14.160 --> 02:18.560
she became pregnant. His wife was against abortion so she wanted to keep and raise the child. OP

02:18.560 --> 02:22.480
decided to divorce and was upset about everyone judging him for wanting to divorce his wife over

02:22.480 --> 02:25.920
the child and wanting to avoid paying child support. I was surprised to read the comments

02:25.920 --> 02:30.160
below. Many of them suggested that OP was being the shit of the earth for not wanting to pay child

02:30.160 --> 02:34.000
support for a child he didn't want, had taken reasonable steps to avoid the creation of,

02:34.000 --> 02:38.240
and whose continued existence was being championed only by his wife and his judgmental parents and

02:38.240 --> 02:41.840
friends. I understand that people should be responsible for kids they have willingly or

02:41.840 --> 02:46.320
irresponsibly created, but in this case why the heck should OP be responsible and forced to

02:46.320 --> 02:50.960
literally pay for his wife's refusal to abort or give up an accidental pregnancy for adoption?

02:50.960 --> 02:54.720
Can someone explain to me why, if no one's allowed to prevent me from getting an abortion

02:54.720 --> 02:58.640
or force me into getting one, why I'm allowed to force a guy to pay for a child if he's made

02:58.640 --> 03:02.960
it clear he doesn't want it, but I made it exist anyway? I don't feel safe about my own reproductive

03:02.960 --> 03:07.200
rights if there's this gaping hole in the opposite genders. Obviously guys shouldn't be allowed to

03:07.200 --> 03:11.360
force women to get abortions, no shit, but why should they be financially burdened or obligated

03:11.360 --> 03:15.440
afterwards? We give women the final choice in terms of a child's existence, and we just force

03:15.440 --> 03:19.360
men to be responsible for her choice either way, regardless of his own feelings on the matter?

03:19.360 --> 03:23.360
I feel like men have an obligation to help pay for an abortion procedure since the pregnancy

03:23.360 --> 03:26.800
is partially his responsibility, but the continuation of that pregnancy is all in the

03:26.800 --> 03:30.720
woman, since she has the final authority over the matter. This is a prime example of what I

03:30.720 --> 03:35.520
would like to call the abortion paradox, that if we value equal rights between men and women,

03:35.520 --> 03:40.400
we either need to ban all access to abortion or dismantle the child support system, because if

03:40.400 --> 03:44.560
one gender has an easy out from the responsibility of pregnancy, then in the name of equality,

03:44.560 --> 03:48.720
both genders must have an easy out. I'm going to attempt to present all sides of the abortion

03:48.720 --> 03:51.840
paradox as objectively as I can, and let's see what we can make out of it.

03:51.840 --> 03:55.520
First of all, we can't discuss the abortion paradox without discussing abortion itself.

03:55.520 --> 04:00.480
The abortion paradox assumes that abortion, in a vacuum, without adding other connected problems

04:00.480 --> 04:05.280
into the mix, should be a legal option for women. But there's still no consensus on that.

04:05.280 --> 04:08.880
Some people are just fine with abortion, some people would never get one themselves but are

04:08.880 --> 04:13.040
okay with it being legal, and some people want abortion to be illegal, with that illegality

04:13.040 --> 04:17.360
having some exceptions or no exceptions at all. There's a range of opinions. The pro-choice side

04:17.360 --> 04:21.120
of the argument believes that abortions should be legal. Their argument generally stems from

04:21.120 --> 04:26.800
three positions. A, the equality argument. B, the lack of personhood rights argument.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.960
And C, the bodily autonomy argument. The first one, the equality argument,

04:30.960 --> 04:35.600
is ideological in nature, and has been described by several feminist authors, most notably bell

04:35.600 --> 04:39.840
hooks, as the following. If men can have sex without fear of getting pregnant, then women

04:39.840 --> 04:43.840
must also have the fear of pregnancy removed from the equation, in the name of equality and sexual

04:43.840 --> 04:47.360
liberation. This point of view spurred the legality of the birth control pill, as well as

04:47.360 --> 04:51.360
abortion access, in order to ensure that no woman carries a fetus to term except the ones that she

04:51.360 --> 04:55.600
explicitly wants to. I can't back up this next statement, so take it with a grain of salt, but

04:55.600 --> 05:00.000
Dr. Laurie Chambers, the chair of the gender studies department at Lakehead University,

05:00.000 --> 05:04.400
explained this concept in her own words in one of her lectures. That even though biological

05:04.400 --> 05:08.480
differences in reproductive systems create a disproportionate amount of risk for women when

05:08.480 --> 05:13.440
engaging in sexual activity, Dr. Chambers asserted that equality demands that society,

05:13.440 --> 05:18.800
culture, and technology fill the gaps where biology fails. The second argument, lack of

05:18.800 --> 05:22.640
personhood, revolves around the status of the zygote or the fetus. It's clear that when a

05:22.640 --> 05:27.120
pregnancy event unfolds properly, a fertilized embryo eventually becomes a baby with human

05:27.120 --> 05:31.600
rights. The pro-choice position is generally that the fetus is not a person up until it's viable

05:31.600 --> 05:35.520
outside of the womb, with some pro-choice extremists outright stating that the fetus

05:35.520 --> 05:39.600
is not a person until natural birth has occurred. And this is why most countries with legal

05:39.600 --> 05:43.680
abortions have a 20-22 week cutoff period for having the procedure. Before this time,

05:43.680 --> 05:48.240
the fetus is not a person, therefore it has no human rights, and therefore abortion is not

05:48.240 --> 05:52.560
murder. The Supreme Court decision Roe vs Wade, which legalized abortion in the US,

05:52.560 --> 05:57.120
has a passage that reads, the state's interest in the life of the fetus became compelling only

05:57.120 --> 06:01.200
at the point of viability, defined as the point at which the fetus can survive independently from

06:01.200 --> 06:05.280
its mother. Let's discuss the third option, bodily autonomy rights. The right for a person

06:05.280 --> 06:09.200
to determine what happens with their own bodies without interference from the state. The pro-choice

06:09.200 --> 06:13.760
position holds that a woman has the choice to abort or not abort based on these bodily

06:13.760 --> 06:18.240
autonomy rights. The bodily autonomy argument generally takes two different forms. The first

06:18.240 --> 06:21.840
revolves around the woman giving consent for another being to draw sustenance from her body.

06:21.840 --> 06:25.520
This point of view supposes that just like a woman may choose to breastfeed or not, a woman may

06:25.520 --> 06:30.160
choose to nourish a fetus through the umbilical cord or not. As both actions take away energy

06:30.160 --> 06:34.080
from the woman, energy which she may desire to keep for herself. And just like a woman may

06:34.080 --> 06:38.080
remove a parasitic tape-form that's suckling nutrients out through her intestine, she can

06:38.080 --> 06:42.400
also remove a zygote that's suckling nutrients out through her uterine lining. The second form

06:42.400 --> 06:47.360
of the bodily autonomy argument involves foreign bodies penetrating into, or existing inside of,

06:47.360 --> 06:51.920
a person's body. As a society, we generally view violations of the integrity of somebody else's

06:51.920 --> 06:57.120
body as a serious crime. An obvious example is the illegality of rape, but other non-sexual forms

06:57.120 --> 07:02.240
of forced foreign object insertion is generally also illegal. For example, tattooing or branding

07:02.240 --> 07:06.720
somebody against their will is not only a serious crime, it can even be a human rights violation.

07:06.720 --> 07:11.200
The bodily autonomy argument, insofar as abortion is concerned, posits that a woman's bodily

07:11.200 --> 07:15.920
autonomy is violated when she has an undesired pregnancy. This violation can stem from her sexual

07:15.920 --> 07:20.560
partner, the fetus, or both, and that therefore abortion rights are necessary to maintain her

07:20.560 --> 07:25.040
bodily autonomy rights. Notice that the lack of personhood argument maintains that the fetus is

07:25.040 --> 07:29.840
not a person and therefore has no rights, while the bodily autonomy argument can be seen as an

07:29.840 --> 07:34.640
implicit acceptance of a fetus's human rights. If a fetus is a person, and it has human rights,

07:34.640 --> 07:38.880
it therefore also has responsibilities. And if we are to take the fetus's actions against the

07:38.880 --> 07:42.960
incubating woman as an assault on her bodily autonomy, then that is actually a serious crime

07:42.960 --> 07:47.440
on the fetus's part, even if the fetus is doing it unintentionally. We generally do consider

07:47.440 --> 07:51.360
unintentional crimes to still be crimes if they're serious enough, even when they're committed by

07:51.360 --> 07:55.840
children. In this case, abortion may even be seen as a form of capital punishment against the

07:55.840 --> 08:16.960
invader, or hell, maybe an eviction. Yes, I used this joke earlier during the Ben Shapiro at

08:16.960 --> 08:21.280
Berkeley video, it was too good to pass up. In any case, the fact that the pro-choice arguments use

08:21.280 --> 08:26.640
both a fetus's human rights and simultaneously a denial of those rights as arguments may seem

08:26.640 --> 08:30.960
inconsistent on their part, but it also may simply be preparedness for any possibility.

08:30.960 --> 08:34.880
On the pro-life side of the argument, people believe that abortion should be illegal.

08:34.880 --> 08:39.440
Their argument generally stem from two positions. A, the responsibility argument,

08:39.440 --> 08:44.080
and B, the sanctity of life argument. The responsibility argument is ideological in

08:44.080 --> 08:48.320
nature, like its pro-choice variant. It states that consenting to sex is the same thing as

08:48.320 --> 08:52.640
consenting to pregnancy and motherhood. They're linked by cause and effect. Having an abortion

08:52.640 --> 08:56.960
is therefore a ducking responsibility for one's actions. The sanctity of life argument is a bit

08:56.960 --> 09:01.440
more complex. It is generally a religious argument revolving around the uniqueness of humanity and

09:01.440 --> 09:05.280
the existence of a soul, but there is also a humanist component to it, where the moral

09:05.280 --> 09:09.520
authority comes not from religious belief, but from a reverence for sentient life. It's from

09:09.520 --> 09:14.000
this reverence that a non-religious concept of universal human rights also springs. In either

09:14.000 --> 09:17.760
case, the sanctity of life argument is fundamentally a moral argument revolving

09:17.760 --> 09:21.920
around the status of the fetus or zygote as a person and therefore having human rights.

09:21.920 --> 09:26.240
For example, some pro-lifers argue that abortions discriminate against people that have been

09:26.240 --> 09:31.440
conceived but not yet born, and that abortion advocates do not actually value all human life,

09:31.440 --> 09:34.640
only forms of human life that have reached a specific level of development.

09:34.640 --> 09:38.560
If we can arbitrarily declare somebody to not have human rights based on their age,

09:38.560 --> 09:43.920
why is it 22 weeks of gestation instead of 10, or 30, or one year old? It seems rather arbitrary.

09:43.920 --> 09:47.920
Some people argue that abortions deprive a fetus of a future, a future that may be fulfilling,

09:47.920 --> 09:51.680
pleasurable, or in some other way positive. This argument is the same as one of the principle

09:51.680 --> 09:55.360
arguments against murder as well. A murderer deprives the victim of the experiences that

09:55.360 --> 09:59.600
the rest of their lives may have held. So too does abortion. This argument often comes in the

09:59.600 --> 10:03.760
simpler form of, what if your baby is the next Einstein, referring to the possibility that the

10:03.760 --> 10:07.920
fetus may grow into somebody who positively impacts the world in some way. Some people argue

10:07.920 --> 10:12.080
from safety that because we do not know when a fetus or a zygote becomes a person with human

10:12.080 --> 10:16.480
rights, we need to assume that all fetuses and all zygotes have human rights even if it later

10:16.480 --> 10:20.320
turns out that they don't, much the same way that reckless behavior that may cause the death of

10:20.320 --> 10:24.800
another person is considered to be both morally and legally wrong even if nobody actually died

10:24.800 --> 10:28.640
as a result of the reckless behavior. All of these arguments are derived from the concept of

10:28.640 --> 10:33.200
universal human rights, with that universality also extending to fetuses and zygotes and not

10:33.200 --> 10:37.440
just already born humans. There's a few other fringe pro-life arguments that we can dismiss

10:37.440 --> 10:41.760
right here. Some people claim that abortion causes a post-abortion shock syndrome, that

10:41.760 --> 10:45.920
abortions routinely cause infertility, and that even at a proper medical facility with trained

10:45.920 --> 10:49.600
staff abortions are extremely unsafe. None of these are true and the evidence against them is

10:49.600 --> 10:53.200
so overwhelming I won't waste any more time on it. So there we go, we've got the pro-life side,

10:53.200 --> 10:57.200
we've got the pro-choice side, and we've got their arguments. And all the arguments on both

10:57.200 --> 11:02.080
sides ultimately hinge on human rights. Let's see if we can poke holes in any of these arguments.

11:02.080 --> 11:05.600
And yes, I'm doing it to both sides. So if you're currently in the middle of writing an angry

11:05.600 --> 11:09.840
comment at least wait until the video is done, okay? The bodily autonomy argument is probably

11:09.840 --> 11:14.400
the strongest one in the pro-choice camp. Even if the fetus or zygote has personhood rights,

11:14.400 --> 11:18.640
which person's rights do you prioritize? The woman's or the child's? I mean, a woman can

11:18.640 --> 11:22.720
always have more children later when she's more ready to do so. It may sound harsh, but it was

11:22.720 --> 11:27.280
often the case in humanity's past, and is absolutely the case in the animal kingdom at large,

11:27.280 --> 11:31.200
that a mother will abandon her child in a moment of extreme weakness or danger because at least

11:31.200 --> 11:34.960
she will still be allowed to reproduce later. It's a sound evolutionary strategy. But there

11:34.960 --> 11:40.000
is a funny hypocrisy to it. Most pro-choice people are also pro-vaccination. My experience

11:40.000 --> 11:44.080
on the child-free subreddit leads me to believe that a lot of pro-choice people routinely make

11:44.080 --> 11:49.520
fun of insane anti-vaxx Facebook moms. And I'm not anti-vaccination myself. I think vaccinations

11:49.520 --> 11:54.080
are obviously a good thing, but let's talk about rights here. Do bodily autonomy rights not also

11:54.080 --> 11:58.720
include the right to not get a vaccination? Is a vaccination needle not also a foreign object?

11:58.720 --> 12:03.680
It seems to be a huge contradiction to me that people who champion bodily autonomy so much

12:03.680 --> 12:07.840
would also force people to get vaccinations if given the chance. And in that same vein,

12:07.840 --> 12:12.080
a large chunk of the pro-choice crowd are also socialists or communists due to the increasingly

12:12.080 --> 12:16.400
large crossover between feminist theory and Marxist theory. But bodily autonomy rights are

12:16.400 --> 12:21.200
predicated on property rights. Your body is your property, just like your house or your car or

12:21.200 --> 12:26.160
your belongings. If society becomes collectivized, where the group owns the property, why do you

12:26.160 --> 12:30.000
think you'd still have abortion rights? Why do you think you'd have any bodily autonomy rights

12:30.000 --> 12:34.560
at all? There's a reason that abortion rights are a thing only in capitalist societies. Because

12:34.560 --> 12:39.680
only capitalists recognize property as owned by individuals, and only capitalists view individual

12:39.680 --> 12:44.400
rights, bodies and all, as meaningful. The pro-life responsibility argument is also a

12:44.400 --> 12:49.040
walking contradiction. It makes no sense to demand that a woman must not take advantage of the latest

12:49.040 --> 12:53.040
medical technology and have a safe abortion, and instead must take responsibility for her actions

12:53.040 --> 12:56.720
by having the child she's conceived, when the history of human technological development has

12:56.720 --> 13:00.960
been entirely based on the objective of reducing the amount of responsibility that people take in

13:00.960 --> 13:05.440
their lives. The hunter-gatherer had a greater responsibility to hunt and gather than the farmer

13:05.440 --> 13:10.320
had to farm. When humanity started building walls around their cities, the danger of attack by

13:10.320 --> 13:14.640
either predators or neighboring humans also shrunk. People could walk around at night safer

13:14.640 --> 13:18.960
than before, with less responsibility laid in on them to protect themselves. Medicine,

13:18.960 --> 13:24.560
transportation, trade, it all serves to reduce risk and increase reward. And subsequently,

13:24.560 --> 13:28.320
individual people have less responsibility to deal with. Saying that somebody should get

13:28.320 --> 13:31.120
an abortion because they should take responsibility for what they've done,

13:31.120 --> 13:34.880
is like saying you shouldn't pull your parachute during a skydive because you should take

13:34.880 --> 13:39.120
responsibility for the earth rapidly rushing towards you. There's just no reason to do so,

13:39.120 --> 13:43.840
and our entire civilization is structured against that idea. Some pro-choice people routinely argue

13:43.840 --> 13:48.560
from the exception. That is, they believe that exceptional circumstances should dictate the rules

13:48.560 --> 13:53.360
for ordinary circumstances. A common tactic is to advocate for abortion rights only in instances

13:53.360 --> 13:57.120
where the mother's life is in danger. From there, this exception is expanded to instances of rape,

13:57.120 --> 14:01.200
and then to detectable birth defects. And then, once the door has been cracked open that much,

14:01.200 --> 14:04.880
they advocate for abortion on demand, under the guise of protecting women's mental health.

14:04.880 --> 14:10.400
This is clearly a disingenuous form of arguing. In no instance, abortion or anything else,

14:10.400 --> 14:14.720
should the exceptional cases of a situation become the primary basis for legal statutes.

14:14.720 --> 14:19.760
Exceptions to the rule are just that, exceptions, they are not the rule themselves. And an argument

14:19.760 --> 14:24.400
for widespread abortion access cannot be based on exceptions. The pro-life position of making

14:24.400 --> 14:28.880
abortion illegal comes with a host of other problems. It's no secret that illegally performed

14:28.880 --> 14:32.720
abortions regularly kill women attempting to get them. And prohibition has taught us that when the

14:32.720 --> 14:36.800
government makes illegal something that the population desires, it doesn't actually eliminate

14:36.800 --> 14:41.680
the activity or product. And furthermore, what would society do with women who is caught getting

14:41.680 --> 14:45.680
an illegal abortion? Would you go to jail for murder? Would the illicit doctor go to jail for

14:45.680 --> 14:50.720
murder? If the doctor but not the woman, why not? If the fetus has human rights, how would this

14:50.720 --> 14:54.560
situation be any different from a woman hiring a hitman to kill somebody? Surely she would be

14:54.560 --> 14:58.960
liable somehow. There's also an argument from consequences to consider. America's downward

14:58.960 --> 15:04.240
spike in crime during the 1990s occurred because abortion became legal in 1973, and all of the

15:04.240 --> 15:08.320
children of low-income single mothers that would have grown up to be criminals were instead aborted.

15:08.320 --> 15:12.960
But most importantly, how would a government even determine if an abortion has taken place?

15:12.960 --> 15:17.360
We already have instances of some US states attempting to charge women for murder because

15:17.360 --> 15:20.800
those women had a miscarriage and it was later discovered that they had been drinking or doing

15:20.800 --> 15:25.280
drugs while pregnant. What if a woman has a natural miscarriage and she gets charged with

15:25.280 --> 15:30.240
murder because she did something minorly unsafe, like drive her car to work, and the prosecutors

15:30.240 --> 15:34.080
determined that she had put her child at undue risk? What if women who are not currently on

15:34.080 --> 15:38.560
their period are simply legally considered to be potentially pregnant and are therefore barred from

15:38.560 --> 15:42.960
doing any activity that may harm a potential child? Making abortion illegal leads us down

15:42.960 --> 15:47.360
a slippery slope that ends with the liberty of women restricted so severely that we may as well

15:47.360 --> 15:51.920
be living under Sharia law. And on the topic of whether or not a fetus or a zygote has human

15:51.920 --> 15:56.240
rights, frankly both sides have done a shit job at arguing their positions. On one hand,

15:56.240 --> 16:00.160
it's clear that the pro-choice argument is false from the beginning. The fetus may not be a baby,

16:00.160 --> 16:03.840
but if the pregnancy is left to its own devices it will likely become one with time. And if you

16:03.840 --> 16:07.920
believe that humans have an innate value, and if you believe in universal human rights, you do

16:07.920 --> 16:12.560
believe this, that is reason enough to protect the fetus. Even taking precautions from this

16:12.560 --> 16:17.680
point of view is no excuse. Cause and effect still applies. The cause is unprotected sex,

16:17.680 --> 16:21.840
and the effect is pregnancy. If you use contraceptives, that's a different set of cause

16:21.840 --> 16:27.120
and effect. The protected sex is the cause, and the effect is no pregnancy. And if the contraceptives

16:27.120 --> 16:32.480
fail, in that case the cause is failed protected sex, and the effect is pregnancy. The real world

16:32.480 --> 16:36.960
still continues around you, regardless of whether or not you consent it to. Moreover, as medical

16:36.960 --> 16:41.440
technology advances, the window of viability that the pro-choice position relies on will continue

16:41.440 --> 16:45.760
to shrink. What will you do when advanced medical technology can make a child viable outside of the

16:45.760 --> 16:51.440
womb at 18 weeks instead of 22? Or at 14 weeks? Or at 10? What will your reason for the denial

16:51.440 --> 16:55.440
of human rights be then? On the other hand, the belief that human rights are granted at the moment

16:55.440 --> 17:00.720
of conception is equally ridiculous. The exact moment a sperm cell touches an egg cell, there's

17:00.720 --> 17:05.680
clearly no brain to even hold the thoughts of a new person. Many fertilized eggs are naturally

17:05.680 --> 17:09.840
flushed out within a normal period as well, as they fail to naturally implant into the uterine

17:09.840 --> 17:14.880
wall. Twins can generate from a duplication of the zygote from up to 14 days after conception.

17:14.880 --> 17:18.480
If human rights begin at conception, because the point of conception is the creation of a new

17:18.480 --> 17:23.440
person, then what is the legal status of twins? They were one person on day zero, and yet two

17:23.440 --> 17:28.800
people on day 14. Does one twin own the other? If fetuses have human rights based not on their

17:28.800 --> 17:33.200
current state, but on their potential to one day be a full human, why do we consider people with

17:33.200 --> 17:38.000
irreversible brain damage to still be human and have human rights? Those people will never regain

17:38.000 --> 17:42.560
the neurological traits that personhood relies on. Hell, forget the science. A lot of pro-lifers use

17:42.560 --> 17:47.680
religious belief as their justification. Okay, let's do that. Leviticus 27 6. And if it be from

17:47.680 --> 17:53.840
a month old even unto five years old, that thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of

17:53.840 --> 17:58.800
silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. A child has no value if

17:58.800 --> 18:04.160
it's under one month old, not 22 weeks after conception, not at birth, but one month after

18:04.160 --> 18:09.840
birth. Numbers 3 15 to 16. Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers by their

18:09.840 --> 18:15.680
families. Every male from a month old and upward, shalt thou number them. And Moses numbered them

18:15.680 --> 18:20.240
according to the word of the Lord. Infants less than again one month old are not to be counted

18:20.240 --> 18:26.800
as people. Exodus 21 22 to 23. If men strive and hurt a woman with child so that her fruit depart

18:26.800 --> 18:31.120
from her, and yet no mischief follow, he shall surely be punished, according to the woman's

18:31.120 --> 18:35.840
husband will lay upon him, and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow,

18:35.840 --> 18:40.560
then thou shalt give life for life. Inducing a miscarriage by inflicting violence on a pregnant

18:40.560 --> 18:45.120
woman, but committing no crime beyond that, is not considered to be a murder. Rather the husband has

18:45.120 --> 18:49.040
leave to assault the man and the judges have leave to fine him, but this is not the biblical

18:49.040 --> 18:53.760
punishment for murder. It seems to me that even in the Bible life does not begin at conception.

18:53.920 --> 18:58.640
Oh, so that's the abortion argument as far as I can tell. Summed up for you in a nice little

18:58.640 --> 19:02.240
package. Well, there was nothing little about it. That was a lot of information to get through.

19:02.240 --> 19:05.920
And we haven't even discussed the abortion paradox yet. Let me remind you what the abortion

19:05.920 --> 19:10.160
paradox is again. If we value equal rights between men and women, we either need to ban

19:10.160 --> 19:14.720
all access to abortion or dismantle the child support system. Because if one gender has an

19:14.720 --> 19:18.480
easy out from the responsibility of pregnancy, then in the name of equality, both genders must

19:18.480 --> 19:22.800
have an easy out. Hey, now that we've heard it a second time, it sounds pretty familiar,

19:22.800 --> 19:27.280
doesn't it? Oh, that's right. It's very similar to the pro-choice equality argument. If men can

19:27.280 --> 19:31.360
have sex without fear of getting pregnant, then women must also have the fear of pregnancy removed

19:31.360 --> 19:34.880
from the equation in the name of equality and sexual liberation. And remember our good friend,

19:34.880 --> 19:39.360
Dr. Chambers, equality demands that society, culture and technology fill the gaps where

19:39.360 --> 19:44.480
biology fails. As it turns out, the development of the abortion paradox unfolded almost like an

19:44.480 --> 19:48.880
arms race between men and women. In a purely biological sense, for the gender of the species

19:48.880 --> 19:53.440
that carries young or performs a disproportionate amount of the child rearing, sex carries a larger

19:53.440 --> 19:58.080
risk. And when a feminist tells you that's not fair, they're right. It's not fair. It's not how

19:58.080 --> 20:02.240
I would have arranged things if I were omnipotent, but here we are. Institutions like monogamy,

20:02.240 --> 20:06.880
marriage, the pressure on men to provide for a family, these were all, as Dr. Chambers put it,

20:06.880 --> 20:11.600
ways that culture filled the gaps where biology failed. They allowed men to take an equal yet

20:11.600 --> 20:15.600
distinct role in the parenting of their kids. But what happens when one of the two parents don't

20:15.600 --> 20:19.520
want to be a parent? Well, that's where the arms race kicks off. If the man doesn't want to be a

20:19.520 --> 20:24.000
father and simply bolts, leaving the woman holding the bag, that's no good. There's still a child

20:24.000 --> 20:28.080
that needs providing for. This is why we invented the concept of child support so that the woman

20:28.080 --> 20:31.840
isn't simply left struggling with a kid she can't hope to raise on her own. And for a while,

20:31.840 --> 20:36.160
that solution made sense. But does it still? With birth control and abortion an option,

20:36.160 --> 20:40.560
does child support still make sense? If we do away with child support, who will help pay for

20:40.560 --> 20:44.160
the child's upbringing? Well, to begin with, if the first half of this video has taught you

20:44.160 --> 20:47.840
anything, it's that the abortion debate is far from settled. If the prime argument for the

20:47.840 --> 20:51.280
abolition of child support is that women can get an abortion, that's a pretty poor argument,

20:51.280 --> 20:55.120
considering the ever-increasing number of restrictions placed on abortion in the USA.

20:55.120 --> 21:00.160
Even if it's legal, it's not commonly available. So let's assume a reproductively ideal world.

21:00.160 --> 21:05.040
In this world, public education is sufficient that everyone knows the dangers of sex. Contraception

21:05.040 --> 21:09.840
is available to all people who want it, for free, as part of a state healthcare program and is both

21:09.840 --> 21:15.360
easy to get and easy to use. Abortions are in the same boat. In this ideal world, would it be

21:15.360 --> 21:20.240
unjust to charge men child support if only the woman wanted a child? Well, some old guard

21:20.240 --> 21:24.080
feminists think it would be unjust. A famous quote from Karen DeCrow reads,

21:24.080 --> 21:28.800
If a woman makes a unilateral decision to bring a pregnancy to term, and the biological father does

21:28.800 --> 21:33.760
not and cannot share in this decision, he should not be liable for 21 years of support. Autonomous

21:33.760 --> 21:37.360
women making independent decisions about their lives should not expect men to finance their

21:37.440 --> 21:41.600
choice. And this is a great point. If women are no longer bound to the home and hearth like

21:41.600 --> 21:45.520
eras past, but can now provide for themselves and their children with the fruits of their own labor,

21:45.520 --> 21:48.800
and every option to bail out of a pregnancy is provided to women,

21:48.800 --> 21:51.760
why should we force a man to finance their unilateral decision?

21:51.760 --> 21:55.040
This was basically the question asked in that child free thread from before,

21:55.040 --> 21:57.280
and the comments do yield some interesting answers.

21:57.280 --> 22:01.440
The courts try not to side with either mom or dad. They try to always side with the kid.

22:01.440 --> 22:06.160
The two adults in this situation don't matter. They're adults who can take care of themselves.

22:06.160 --> 22:10.720
Kids are vulnerable, and at the mercy of their parents. It's not that the non-custodial parent

22:10.720 --> 22:15.040
owes child support as punishment for their choice to have sex. The idea is that the child deserves

22:15.040 --> 22:19.120
to be provided for regardless of the circumstances of the parent's relationship. The argument put

22:19.120 --> 22:23.120
forward is that the child's right to be provided for trumps the rights of either adult. That's not

22:23.120 --> 22:27.200
an unreasonable argument, but it is quite convenient that because of this argument,

22:27.200 --> 22:31.360
once the contraceptive and abortion arguments are finally permanently settled in the way that the

22:31.360 --> 22:35.360
radical left wants them to be settled, that this position will result in men routinely getting

22:35.360 --> 22:39.360
thrown under the bus. As it is right now, both genders are getting thrown under the bus, which

22:39.360 --> 22:44.400
is equal but bad. And the only ways people are working to improve the situation seem to only be

22:44.400 --> 22:49.600
improving women's a lot, not men's. The unfortunate truth is that there are biological differences

22:49.600 --> 22:53.600
that warrant a nuanced and meandering legal framework in order to have a somewhat fair

22:53.600 --> 22:58.560
outcome for the parties involved. What we have right now isn't really fair, but our biology isn't

22:58.560 --> 23:03.200
fair, so the law attempts to accommodate. Women must retain exclusive rights to their bodies full

23:03.200 --> 23:07.120
stop. Children must be cared for full stop. I don't really like the idea of people being

23:07.120 --> 23:11.840
financially saddled for 18 years, but right now there is no other reliable system in place to

23:11.840 --> 23:15.920
make sure that the children are provided for. Oh, biology isn't fair, eh? Whatever happened to

23:15.920 --> 23:21.040
society, culture, and technology must fill the gaps where biology fails. That feminist precept

23:21.040 --> 23:25.520
was used to justify birth control and abortion, but once it's men's biology failing them,

23:25.520 --> 23:29.520
suddenly biology isn't fair so we just gotta live with it? What if abortions are made entirely

23:29.520 --> 23:33.520
illegal and you're just told that biology isn't fair? Will you be happy with that?

23:33.520 --> 23:37.120
There's a lot of shit that isn't fair for women, I assure you, so I don't have a ton of patience

23:37.120 --> 23:41.120
for guys who moan about child support for a result they knew was a possibility going into sex,

23:41.120 --> 23:44.800
shrug. There's a lot of shit that isn't fair for men, I assure you, so I don't have a ton

23:44.800 --> 23:48.160
of patience for girls who moan about pregnancy as a result they knew was a possibility going

23:48.160 --> 23:52.960
into sex, shrug. See how sexist that sounds? The excuse of don't have sex if you don't want to pay

23:52.960 --> 23:57.040
child support to men is identical to don't have sex if you don't want to get pregnant to women,

23:57.040 --> 24:01.680
and we decided that was grossly inappropriate long ago. If you are a man, by consenting to sex

24:01.680 --> 24:06.000
you are basically signing a contract that you are allowing a woman and her body to use your DNA

24:06.000 --> 24:12.240
how she sees fit. I'm gonna stop you right there. So does that include when you blow your load in a

24:12.240 --> 24:17.280
condom and then the girl takes it and pours in her vag? Does that include that? Does that include

24:17.280 --> 24:22.160
women sneaking into sperm banks and impregnating themselves? Does that include underage boys who

24:22.160 --> 24:27.920
are raped by their female teachers? You know those MGTOW idiots? Yeah, the male isolationists

24:27.920 --> 24:31.920
that believe that any contact with a woman, however casual, is just too dangerous for them

24:31.920 --> 24:36.160
to risk? You're basically making their argument for them. The law isn't designed so that women

24:36.160 --> 24:40.000
have the right to not be parents, it's designed so that they have the right to say what happens

24:40.000 --> 24:43.520
to their body, and the fact that medically speaking this also allows women to choose

24:43.520 --> 24:48.960
not to be a parent is an unintended and admittedly unfair consequence. Once all bodily autonomy

24:48.960 --> 24:53.360
questions have been resolved, what is best for the child is tantamount, in this case two

24:53.360 --> 24:58.640
financially supportive parents. And here is where we get to the ultimate hole in the what's best for

24:58.640 --> 25:03.520
the kid argument. Some people advocate for what has come to be known as financial abortion for men,

25:03.520 --> 25:09.120
that just like how women can get a physical abortion, men can simply opt out of parenthood,

25:09.120 --> 25:13.600
lose all rights, lose all responsibilities, not have to pay child support and walk away from the

25:13.600 --> 25:18.400
whole situation scot-free, just like how it seems that women can walk away from the whole situation

25:18.400 --> 25:22.960
also scot-free. But a lot of these commenters in this thread are right when they say that physical

25:22.960 --> 25:28.640
abortion for women and financial abortion for men are not parallel concepts. A physical abortion

25:28.640 --> 25:32.960
means that there's no child to care for by either party when the deed is done. A financial abortion

25:32.960 --> 25:36.560
means that the woman is still left with the financial burden of raising a kid by herself,

25:36.560 --> 25:42.640
even in a reproductively ideal world. Even if the man met all reasonable time frames for filing for

25:42.640 --> 25:47.680
a hypothetical financial abortion, at the end of the day a kid still exists, and therefore the

25:47.680 --> 25:51.680
financial abortion idea is not an equivalent solution to the physical abortions currently

25:51.680 --> 25:55.440
available. You know, if only we had a really easy way to figure out this whole scenario,

25:55.440 --> 25:59.920
if only women had a way to unilaterally sever all their rights and responsibilities to their newborn

25:59.920 --> 26:03.520
child, including the right of financial responsibility, the same way that financial

26:03.520 --> 26:08.240
abortions advocate for men. If that were the case, then giving that option to simply walk away from

26:08.240 --> 26:13.760
their kids would not only be possible, it would be necessary if we value equality. Oh wait, we do

26:13.760 --> 26:18.800
have that. It's called safe haven laws. Safe haven laws allow mothers of newborn children to

26:18.800 --> 26:22.160
give up their kids to the government. These children become wards of the state, and the

26:22.160 --> 26:26.240
mother is allowed to remain nameless within the court. The mother waives all rights to the child,

26:26.240 --> 26:31.600
but is also no longer burdened by responsibility, including financial responsibility. Not only do

26:31.600 --> 26:35.440
safe haven laws allow mothers to duck their obligation to actually pay for their child's

26:35.440 --> 26:39.760
upbringing, it also provides a vehicle for mothers who may wish to hide the existence of their child

26:39.760 --> 26:45.520
from their father for good or bad reasons to do so with the assistance of the legal system.

26:45.520 --> 26:50.400
This sounds a lot more like a female equivalent of the financial abortion for men argument than

26:50.400 --> 26:55.200
physical abortions ever will be. If the law truly prioritized the rights of the child to be provided

26:55.200 --> 26:59.920
for by the fruits of the parents' labors over either parent's own rights, then safe haven laws

26:59.920 --> 27:03.840
wouldn't exist. Women would not be allowed to simply give up their kids and move on,

27:03.840 --> 27:08.160
unburdened with responsibility, but they can. Despite men not being allowed to do so,

27:08.160 --> 27:12.880
and despite everybody bending over fucking backwards to try and justify that, women can,

27:12.880 --> 27:16.640
and do. In the end, I don't think the abortion paradox is about abortion at all.

27:16.640 --> 27:20.960
The question, why can't men opt out of child support if women can get abortions, is a

27:20.960 --> 27:25.200
nonsensical question, because it's comparing two separate, distinct, and ultimately unrelated

27:25.200 --> 27:29.920
issues. The real question is why can't men opt out of child support if women can opt out of

27:29.920 --> 27:34.800
supporting their child? And for that, there's no answer. Maybe it's because society values men's

27:34.800 --> 27:38.800
rights less than women's. I mean, women's movements have become legitimized, and men's

27:38.800 --> 27:43.440
movements have been laughed at. Maybe it's because men generally tend to work harder and longer than

27:43.440 --> 27:47.680
women on average, and society requires some sort of incentive in order to keep them going.

27:47.680 --> 27:52.160
And if being the respected and loved head of a nuclear family no longer functions as a suitable

27:52.160 --> 27:56.000
carrot, then the government is required to fashion a suitable stick to get the job done.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.080
Maybe it's because our culture is more willing to accept the idea that a man would instantly

28:00.080 --> 28:03.920
abandon his child if given the opportunity than accept the idea that a woman would do the same.

28:03.920 --> 28:07.840
Or maybe it's because people just generally don't think of the double standards that exist

28:07.840 --> 28:11.600
when women can give up their children but men cannot. All in all, the childfree subreddit

28:11.600 --> 28:15.280
is an interesting place. It gets a lot of undeserved hatred from a lot of people who

28:15.280 --> 28:18.800
assume that the place exists solely to get off on the deaths of babies or something.

28:18.800 --> 28:23.040
But it's not that at all. It's a mostly rational corner of the internet where a politically diverse

28:23.040 --> 28:27.040
group of people come together based on their shared desire to never reproduce. Some left-leaning

28:27.040 --> 28:31.920
people have feminist reasons, some right-leaning people have MRA reasons, but most people just have

28:31.920 --> 28:36.240
individualist reasons for not wanting kids. And there's also a lot of overlap politically too.

28:36.240 --> 28:40.560
Like I said before, the bodily autonomists are strangely pro-mandatory vaccination sometimes,

28:40.560 --> 28:44.320
but there's more to it than that. For example, a lot of people who are normally pro-universal

28:44.320 --> 28:49.040
social safety net often like to chastise overbreeding moms who suck up tax dollars

28:49.040 --> 28:52.880
in the form of child-based subsidies. In any case, the sub's got a lot of great people in it.

28:52.880 --> 28:58.320
Oh yeah, having to pay some fee for a few years is way worse than possibly being forced by stupid

28:58.320 --> 29:02.880
misogynist laws to carry an unwanted fetus to term, go through life disruption, the agony,

29:02.880 --> 29:08.160
the risk of fucking death. Poor men. Well, every community has got its bad apples.

29:08.160 --> 29:11.120
Don't worry lady, if you just want to baselessly man-hate,

29:11.120 --> 29:14.960
there's a ton of reddit subs out there just for you. It's not hate speech after all.
