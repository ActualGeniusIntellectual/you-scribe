Hello my friends, welcome to SJ Weekly.

00:03.120 --> 00:06.240
No coffee sip today, it's too late in the day for me to be having coffee.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.240
You guys missed it.

00:07.240 --> 00:10.800
But I have been munching on crackers the past few minutes, so maybe you guys can have a

00:10.800 --> 00:13.000
cracker or two with me.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
Mmm, pretty good.

00:17.000 --> 00:24.260
I have to say guys, thank you very much for all the support you've shown me.

00:24.260 --> 00:26.440
The channel's blown up in the past week.

00:26.440 --> 00:30.320
I've been getting over a thousand subs a day for the past three or four days now.

00:30.320 --> 00:35.720
People are watching the videos at unprecedented rates, and I do really appreciate everyone's

00:35.720 --> 00:37.560
support and enthusiasm.

00:37.560 --> 00:39.940
It's pretty incredible, I'm not gonna lie.

00:39.940 --> 00:43.560
And because of this, I am working on something big to commemorate.

00:43.560 --> 00:48.000
So let's get through today's articles, I only chose four because it has to be a slightly

00:48.000 --> 00:51.080
shorter video since I'm quite busy, but let's take a look at them.

00:51.080 --> 00:55.120
First up on the Telegraph, Melania Trump, an apology.

00:55.120 --> 00:59.740
Following last Saturday's Telegraph magazine cover story, The Mystery of Melania, we have

00:59.740 --> 01:04.280
been asked to make clear that the article contained a number of false statements, which

01:04.280 --> 01:06.880
we accept should not have been published.

01:06.880 --> 01:12.280
Really, on the one hand it's a good thing that they're, you know, admitting when they

01:12.280 --> 01:13.280
went wrong.

01:13.280 --> 01:18.040
On the other hand, why did they publish them without verifying them?

01:18.040 --> 01:20.080
You're a fucking news organization.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.840
Mrs Trump's father was not a fearsome presence and he did not control the family.

01:23.880 --> 01:27.920
Mrs Trump did not leave her design and architecture course at university relating to the completion

01:27.920 --> 01:32.080
of an exam, as alleged in the article, but rather because she wanted to pursue a successful

01:32.080 --> 01:34.200
career as a professional model.

01:34.200 --> 01:38.320
Mrs Trump was not struggling in her modeling career before she met Mr Trump, and she did

01:38.320 --> 01:42.080
not advance in her career due to the assistance of Mr Trump.

01:42.080 --> 01:46.780
These things have been consistent claims about Melania, actually, and it's quite hypocritical

01:46.780 --> 01:52.300
to hear them come from the far left because they're all about sex positivity until a woman

01:52.380 --> 01:57.340
who has actually done sex work becomes the first lady of the United States.

01:57.340 --> 02:01.300
Then they turn into the level of prudes that you only see on the religious right.

02:01.300 --> 02:05.500
We apologize unreservedly to the first lady and her family for any embarrassment caused

02:05.500 --> 02:08.040
by our publication of these allegations.

02:08.040 --> 02:13.400
As a mark of regret, we have agreed to pay Mrs Trump substantial damages as well as her

02:13.400 --> 02:15.500
legal costs.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.060
You know, good on them.

02:17.060 --> 02:18.060
Good on them.

02:18.060 --> 02:19.060
Hmm?

02:19.060 --> 02:20.060
What?

02:20.060 --> 02:21.060
What's up?

02:21.820 --> 02:23.820
I'm doing the video!

02:23.820 --> 02:26.820
Well, you should have fucking started when you said you were gonna!

02:26.820 --> 02:27.820
God damn it, Naomi!

02:27.820 --> 02:28.820
What?

02:28.820 --> 02:29.820
You fucking what?

02:29.820 --> 02:30.820
Ow!

02:30.820 --> 02:31.820
Ow!

02:31.820 --> 02:32.820
Don't tickle me!

02:32.820 --> 02:33.820
Ahahahaha!

02:33.820 --> 02:34.820
Stop!

02:34.820 --> 02:36.820
Alright, well, I'm back.

02:36.820 --> 02:40.820
We can blame all that lost time on my girlfriend, Naomi, of course.

02:40.820 --> 02:43.620
I think we finished this article, though, didn't we?

02:43.620 --> 02:44.620
I think that's all done.

02:44.620 --> 02:46.660
Let's go on to the next one.

02:46.660 --> 02:50.020
White America's need for white heroes.

02:50.020 --> 02:53.980
This is obviously about the Cobrington Catholic megakids.

02:53.980 --> 02:58.340
They began the week decked out in red hats and having a widely viewed confrontation with

02:58.340 --> 03:02.900
a lone elderly indigenous man standing between them and a group of black activists following

03:02.900 --> 03:04.620
an anti-abortion rally.

03:04.620 --> 03:08.180
That's quite the washed opinion of everything that happened, eh?

03:08.180 --> 03:10.160
Now they've been invited to the White House.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.220
Why are they being invited to the White House?

03:12.220 --> 03:15.220
They're being invited to the White House because they're white and because they're boosting

03:15.220 --> 03:16.980
the President's brand.

03:16.980 --> 03:21.380
And because inviting them to the White House makes them a symbol once more, for a President

03:21.380 --> 03:25.420
who wields such symbols like a weapon because he lacks anything else and because he knows

03:25.420 --> 03:29.180
how his supporters devour such things.

03:29.180 --> 03:31.420
Holy fuck, dude.

03:31.420 --> 03:35.300
Maybe it's because they were victims of a massive media smear campaign that did not

03:35.300 --> 03:37.080
care about the truth at all?

03:37.080 --> 03:41.640
These young men are now the red-hatted symbol of an entitled white privilege that perpetually

03:41.640 --> 03:42.940
sees itself as righteous.

03:42.940 --> 03:44.940
Hold on a minute, aren't you white?

03:44.940 --> 03:49.340
I'm just gonna, like, you look reasonably white.

03:49.340 --> 03:51.940
Oh wait, Pavlovitz.

03:51.940 --> 03:55.960
I'm gonna guess, I'm just gonna guess here that you're white when it's convenient and

03:55.960 --> 03:58.700
you're Jewish when it's convenient, aren't you?

03:58.700 --> 04:03.220
This week, conservative politicians, partisan media, and the President himself rushed in

04:03.220 --> 04:08.700
with the supposed smoking gun of an extended video that apparently exonerated the students

04:08.700 --> 04:13.740
and served as some gotcha moment that indicated the fake news of the left.

04:13.740 --> 04:15.240
That is not reality.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.520
This is what gaslighters do.

04:17.520 --> 04:21.660
Create an alternate reality and then try to make you lose faith in your eyes and then

04:21.660 --> 04:22.860
your sanity.

04:22.860 --> 04:27.820
Are you claiming the video was fucking doctored?

04:27.820 --> 04:35.380
I mean, if the extended video is real, if it wasn't, like, put on, if it wasn't just

04:35.380 --> 04:40.100
something that someone made up, but it's actually a real video, then that is reality.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.360
That is in fact reality.

04:41.360 --> 04:46.420
And what you initially saw was it was also reality, but it was an edited, cut-down version

04:46.420 --> 04:47.420
of it.

04:47.420 --> 04:51.420
It sounds like what you're complaining about is that reality is not lining up to your initial

04:51.420 --> 04:53.080
reaction of what happened.

04:53.080 --> 04:56.680
The longer video still reveals everything the initial clip did.

04:56.680 --> 05:02.060
Poorly chaperoned entitled white kids wearing a symbol of supremacy and acting very questionably

05:02.060 --> 05:04.000
at a rally they clearly had no interest in.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.160
Man, I hope this guy doesn't have kids, because if he does, he's going to suck the fun right

05:09.160 --> 05:10.800
out of their lives.

05:10.800 --> 05:11.800
Really chaperoned.

05:11.800 --> 05:17.880
Yeah, you mean the most fun parts of being a teenager is when the adults aren't around

05:17.880 --> 05:19.280
constantly henpecking you?

05:19.280 --> 05:21.180
A symbol of supremacy?

05:21.180 --> 05:25.720
I'm sorry, but the MAGA hat is not like the KKK hood.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.400
It's not like the Nazi armband.

05:27.400 --> 05:31.340
I know you really, really want it to be that way, but it's not.

05:31.340 --> 05:36.160
They still had no business on a school outing decked out in MAGA hats, given how divisive

05:36.160 --> 05:38.600
and politically loaded those hats are to so many.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.120
You see, I hate this logic.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.280
I hate this fucking logic, because you know what?

05:42.280 --> 05:49.140
If you have an idea, you have some kind of idea that is taboo but still necessary for

05:49.140 --> 05:55.440
society to discuss, and then you just make all symbolism or all symbology of the idea

05:55.440 --> 06:01.200
to be divisive and politically loaded, that is an attempt at censorship.

06:01.200 --> 06:06.000
It means that we don't want you talking about this idea, and so we are going to object to

06:06.000 --> 06:10.400
any shorthand of the idea as being an offensive symbol.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.780
So let's say that they traded out their MAGA hats for something else.

06:12.780 --> 06:16.120
Let's say they just traded out for a build the wall t-shirt.

06:16.120 --> 06:17.840
Oh, you're going to complain about that, aren't you?

06:17.840 --> 06:19.880
It's going to be divisive and politically loaded.

06:19.880 --> 06:24.200
How about just a t-shirt that says, stop illegal immigration?

06:24.200 --> 06:26.620
You're probably still going to fucking find something about that.

06:26.620 --> 06:33.040
The meltdown of the radical left over the slogan, make America great again, which is

06:33.040 --> 06:39.280
in itself not an offensive slogan, shows that they don't actually care about the slogan,

06:39.280 --> 06:41.840
but they care about censoring the idea behind it.

06:41.840 --> 06:46.460
They had no business engaging a group of screaming activists or counter protesters or a lone

06:46.460 --> 06:50.840
indigenous man playing a drum while mocking him, for any reason.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.400
You had no reason to be there.

06:53.400 --> 06:54.400
Just fuck off.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.640
It's a public space.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.880
You know, they were on a school outing at the Lincoln Memorial.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.440
That's reason enough to be there.

07:00.440 --> 07:01.440
No, no.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.440
It's like, fuck, fuck you.

07:02.440 --> 07:03.440
You shouldn't, you shouldn't have been there.

07:03.440 --> 07:07.080
You shouldn't have been the unfortunate victim of the media yet again.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.560
Oh God, this, this whole thing is fucking stupid.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.960
This is quite literally the definition of victim blaming you guys.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.360
The story hasn't changed.

07:14.360 --> 07:15.780
Yeah, it's changed.

07:15.780 --> 07:19.260
It's changed because they were the victims and you don't like that.

07:19.260 --> 07:23.960
And now they merit a White House invitation as if they are civil rights heroes or maligned

07:23.960 --> 07:24.960
patriots.

07:24.960 --> 07:28.400
As it turns out, they are.

07:28.440 --> 07:31.400
This is the fundamental difference though, is that they are those things.

07:31.400 --> 07:41.000
And they're those things because strangely enough, conservatism, especially younger conservatives

07:41.000 --> 07:46.320
and youth conservatism is on the out in our society now.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.960
That is the counterculture.

07:47.960 --> 07:52.600
And when they get oppressed and they stand up for their rights, that they become civil

07:52.600 --> 07:53.600
rights heroes.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.500
They become maligned patriots.

07:56.500 --> 08:01.820
It's so strange to think about because it has never happened before in my lifespan.

08:01.820 --> 08:06.740
It's probably never happened before in the past 50 years, but still here we are.

08:06.740 --> 08:11.640
It's like that common joke of how do you be edgy on campus nowadays, be a conservative

08:11.640 --> 08:13.620
because everyone's doing all the hippie shit now.

08:13.620 --> 08:16.780
The right's nonsensical narrative is thick with cognitive dissonance.

08:16.780 --> 08:21.380
The lone unarmed elderly man intimidated the dozens of high school students.

08:21.380 --> 08:26.060
Now see, I don't think anyone's saying that they intimidated the high school students.

08:26.060 --> 08:27.340
That would be dumb.

08:27.340 --> 08:32.660
I think the unarmed elderly man tried to intimidate the high school students and none of them

08:32.660 --> 08:33.960
were buying it.

08:33.960 --> 08:38.840
The fact that they were standing there laughing at his attempt shows that they were not being

08:38.840 --> 08:39.840
intimidated.

08:39.840 --> 08:42.860
Nobody thought that the old native guy with a drum was a threat.

08:42.860 --> 08:46.540
Everyone was laughing at the fact that he acted like he was a threat when he was not.

08:46.540 --> 08:50.500
You should try an America where we can call out the poor behavior of young white men without

08:50.500 --> 08:54.020
saying we hate them or that we're dehumanizing them without claiming we're calling for their

08:54.020 --> 08:56.420
heads without it being a partisan witch hunt.

08:56.420 --> 09:01.580
You know, fair enough, but this was not a case where young white men behaved poorly

09:01.580 --> 09:03.860
and you just can't fucking accept that.

09:03.860 --> 09:05.100
Let's go overseas though.

09:05.100 --> 09:11.940
To revenge rape, Pakistani council order sister of accused rapist to be raped as punishment.

09:11.940 --> 09:15.820
I know this is a bit older, right?

09:15.820 --> 09:17.420
I just got handed the article.

09:17.420 --> 09:25.140
I hope at some point Sargon did an all cultures are beautiful video on this because holy shit

09:25.140 --> 09:26.140
guys.

09:26.140 --> 09:27.140
Yeah, this is how you dispense justice.

09:27.140 --> 09:29.020
This is the way to fucking do it.

09:29.020 --> 09:32.940
There is another horrific rape report from Pakistan where village elders ordered a revenge

09:32.940 --> 09:34.740
rape as a punishment.

09:34.740 --> 09:38.980
After a man was accused of raping a woman, the village council formed and ordered the

09:38.980 --> 09:42.440
sister of the accused to be raped by the brother of his victim as justice.

09:42.440 --> 09:45.260
They all then reportedly watched the rape.

09:45.260 --> 09:52.820
Oh my, see everyone who says that individualism or, or, or classical liberalism doesn't work.

09:52.820 --> 09:58.540
This is why any form of collectivism, whether it be social justice, whether it be religious

09:58.540 --> 10:04.420
conservatism, whether it be Islam, whether it be white nationalism or, or anything else,

10:04.420 --> 10:08.520
they don't work because they allow shit like this.

10:08.520 --> 10:13.640
When you treat people as individuals, then harming the accused family as punishment for

10:13.640 --> 10:19.580
their crimes is unacceptable, and it is only unacceptable under individualism.

10:19.580 --> 10:24.640
But if you are your family, if you are your friends, if you are your spouse, your kids,

10:24.640 --> 10:30.400
your race, or your religion, then you can just harm uninvolved people.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.840
These crimes are often ordered by councils known as a jirga that enforce Islamic justice.

10:33.840 --> 10:38.320
In 2002, a jirga ordered the gang up of a 28 year old after her 12 year old brother

10:38.320 --> 10:40.560
was accused of an affair with an older woman.

10:40.560 --> 10:44.680
Notably, the victim of the second rape was also arrested.

10:44.680 --> 10:45.680
What?

10:45.680 --> 10:46.680
Why?

10:46.680 --> 10:51.840
Islamic councils have previously ordered revenge rapes.

10:51.840 --> 10:55.740
One such case occurred last year in Multan, Pakistan.

10:55.740 --> 11:00.160
Some 20 people were arrested after a 16 year old girl was ordered to be raped by the brother

11:00.160 --> 11:05.040
of a 12 year old girl who was previously raped by the 16 year old's brother.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.920
Jesus Christ.

11:06.920 --> 11:11.120
Again, the elders and family watched the second rape.

11:11.120 --> 11:14.640
In that case, however, the mothers of the two girls filed complaints.

11:14.640 --> 11:20.520
In this case, the council appeared composed largely of the two families reaching an agreement

11:20.520 --> 11:24.560
on just punishment in using an innocent girl to be raped.

11:24.560 --> 11:30.460
I will never accept the hypothesis that all cultures are beautiful.

11:30.460 --> 11:31.460
Fuck that.

11:31.460 --> 11:35.400
Let's finish up with something lighthearted over at Hard Drive.

11:35.400 --> 11:42.180
Real school bully has no idea he's creating future polygon video content creator.

11:42.180 --> 11:43.180
It really is true.

11:43.180 --> 11:46.960
A lot of the game journos out there seem like they were probably bullied as kids and now

11:46.960 --> 11:51.760
they're using their little bits of power that they've managed to accumulate as adults to

11:51.760 --> 11:55.520
bully others themselves just because they can't fucking deal with it.

11:55.520 --> 12:01.760
I'm sure when those people back during gamergate said things like gamer should be bullied again,

12:01.760 --> 12:06.640
they were probably just releasing some old catharsis.

12:06.640 --> 12:10.320
Local bully Justin Marwall was reportedly unaware that the child he was picking on in

12:10.320 --> 12:15.360
his 8th grade class, Chris Stevenson, will go on to make popular video content for the

12:15.360 --> 12:18.000
website Polygon in 15 years.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.900
Hold on, Polygon?

12:20.900 --> 12:22.900
Popular video content?

12:22.900 --> 12:26.940
They've got 650,000 subs, it's more than me.

12:26.940 --> 12:28.020
And you know what?

12:28.020 --> 12:30.080
Some of these videos are actually kind of popular.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.720
When you hit the six figures, you know, you're doing okay.

12:32.720 --> 12:35.960
So you know, good job, I'm actually kind of surprised.

12:35.960 --> 12:40.760
There's definitely some variation though, there's like 11k here, 189k there, one of

12:40.760 --> 12:47.440
the ones up here has 1.5 million, yeah here it is, the Skyrim books video, there's definitely

12:47.440 --> 12:48.440
some variation.

12:48.440 --> 12:55.480
I was definitely expecting something more like Feminist Frequency with 222k subs and

12:55.480 --> 13:02.800
they barely get the fuck out of 1000 views per video, Jesus Christ.

13:02.800 --> 13:07.620
My channel is doing better than this, and I have like, what, one eighth the sub count?

13:07.620 --> 13:11.580
It's an age old adage, you have to be careful who you make fun of as a kid because you never

13:11.580 --> 13:15.720
know who's YouTube video explaining how the Zelda timeline matches up with the episodes

13:15.720 --> 13:21.220
of Frasier you'll be chuckling to in a decade, said Martha Harbinson, a teacher at Marwell's

13:21.220 --> 13:23.300
and Stevenson's middle school.

13:23.300 --> 13:26.800
There was this one kid I used to bully relentlessly when I was in middle school.

13:26.800 --> 13:31.340
Now he's a streamer with 800 subs on Twitch, and you bet there's egg on my face.

13:31.340 --> 13:34.880
According to close sources at the middle...

13:34.880 --> 13:39.620
You know, they could almost be describing me.

13:39.620 --> 13:43.140
According to close sources at the middle school, Stevenson, the future content creation starlet

13:43.140 --> 13:44.860
often keeps to himself.

13:44.860 --> 13:48.660
Yeah, kids were picking on him at recess the other day because he was sitting by himself

13:48.660 --> 13:53.260
playing Nintendo Switch, said a lunch monitor Arthur Parsons while cleaning up some trash

13:53.260 --> 13:54.900
in the school's cafeteria.

13:54.900 --> 13:59.420
I hate seeing kids bullied so I sat him down and explained that he's going to be okay.

13:59.420 --> 14:02.580
Chris is a smart kid and one day he might be Justin's boss.

14:02.580 --> 14:07.940
Or even better, he'll funnel years of video game expertise and social torment into a fun,

14:07.940 --> 14:12.340
quirky personality that people will relate to during 20 minute voiceovers for content

14:12.340 --> 14:16.880
creation giants Polygon and Vox, Parsons continued.

14:16.880 --> 14:20.960
People love that self-deprecation shit online and it's pretty hard to fake.

14:20.960 --> 14:24.740
At press time, Stevenson was seen editing together clips of himself being bullied into

14:24.740 --> 14:31.280
a meaty but lighthearted video entitled, The Strength of Justin Marwall's Fists Explained,

14:31.280 --> 14:32.880
Bullied Episode 8.

14:32.880 --> 14:36.800
You know, this is obviously a joke article, but I still really enjoy it.

14:36.800 --> 14:41.240
And I just gotta say, if there's anyone here who's watching that's younger and you are

14:41.240 --> 14:44.080
getting bullied, the honest truth is don't worry about it.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.400
I got bullied in school.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.520
I came out pretty much fine.

14:47.520 --> 14:52.360
I certainly don't suffer from self-esteem issues as people around me can attest to.

14:52.360 --> 14:55.360
And if it's really starting to bother you, if you're really starting to have some problems

14:55.360 --> 15:01.400
with it, you have to realize that school is like a walled garden and it's safe and it's

15:01.400 --> 15:04.260
confining but there's no freedom there.

15:04.260 --> 15:08.440
And when you get out of school, as long as you're willing to take a few chances, leave

15:08.440 --> 15:13.640
some of the old memories and some of the old traumas behind, you know, kind of pony up

15:13.640 --> 15:16.440
and get on with your life, you will be fine.

15:16.440 --> 15:17.760
Things will be okay.

15:17.760 --> 15:19.520
It's not going to be hell forever.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.080
It just seems like it right now.

15:21.080 --> 15:24.000
And you don't even need to worry about the bullies because there are probably other people

15:24.000 --> 15:25.360
in your life that care about you.

15:25.360 --> 15:26.840
Focus on them.

15:26.840 --> 15:30.600
And hey, if you have nobody that cares about you, then you should know that I care about

15:30.600 --> 15:31.600
you.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.100
Anyway, that's it for me, my friends.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.020
I'm getting out of here.

15:35.020 --> 15:39.320
As I said at the start of the episode, thank you very much for all the recent support.

15:39.320 --> 15:42.560
It is very overwhelming and I'm quite humbled to see it.

15:42.560 --> 15:46.280
Have fun, guys.

15:46.280 --> 15:50.640
I love you.
