0	3120	Hello my friends, welcome to SJ Weekly.
3120	6240	No coffee sip today, it's too late in the day for me to be having coffee.
6240	7240	You guys missed it.
7240	10800	But I have been munching on crackers the past few minutes, so maybe you guys can have a
10800	13000	cracker or two with me.
13000	17000	Mmm, pretty good.
17000	24260	I have to say guys, thank you very much for all the support you've shown me.
24260	26440	The channel's blown up in the past week.
26440	30320	I've been getting over a thousand subs a day for the past three or four days now.
30320	35720	People are watching the videos at unprecedented rates, and I do really appreciate everyone's
35720	37560	support and enthusiasm.
37560	39940	It's pretty incredible, I'm not gonna lie.
39940	43560	And because of this, I am working on something big to commemorate.
43560	48000	So let's get through today's articles, I only chose four because it has to be a slightly
48000	51080	shorter video since I'm quite busy, but let's take a look at them.
51080	55120	First up on the Telegraph, Melania Trump, an apology.
55120	59740	Following last Saturday's Telegraph magazine cover story, The Mystery of Melania, we have
59740	64280	been asked to make clear that the article contained a number of false statements, which
64280	66880	we accept should not have been published.
66880	72280	Really, on the one hand it's a good thing that they're, you know, admitting when they
72280	73280	went wrong.
73280	78040	On the other hand, why did they publish them without verifying them?
78040	80080	You're a fucking news organization.
80080	83840	Mrs Trump's father was not a fearsome presence and he did not control the family.
83880	87920	Mrs Trump did not leave her design and architecture course at university relating to the completion
87920	92080	of an exam, as alleged in the article, but rather because she wanted to pursue a successful
92080	94200	career as a professional model.
94200	98320	Mrs Trump was not struggling in her modeling career before she met Mr Trump, and she did
98320	102080	not advance in her career due to the assistance of Mr Trump.
102080	106780	These things have been consistent claims about Melania, actually, and it's quite hypocritical
106780	112300	to hear them come from the far left because they're all about sex positivity until a woman
112380	117340	who has actually done sex work becomes the first lady of the United States.
117340	121300	Then they turn into the level of prudes that you only see on the religious right.
121300	125500	We apologize unreservedly to the first lady and her family for any embarrassment caused
125500	128040	by our publication of these allegations.
128040	133400	As a mark of regret, we have agreed to pay Mrs Trump substantial damages as well as her
133400	135500	legal costs.
135500	137060	You know, good on them.
137060	138060	Good on them.
138060	139060	Hmm?
139060	140060	What?
140060	141060	What's up?
141820	143820	I'm doing the video!
143820	146820	Well, you should have fucking started when you said you were gonna!
146820	147820	God damn it, Naomi!
147820	148820	What?
148820	149820	You fucking what?
149820	150820	Ow!
150820	151820	Ow!
151820	152820	Don't tickle me!
152820	153820	Ahahahaha!
153820	154820	Stop!
154820	156820	Alright, well, I'm back.
156820	160820	We can blame all that lost time on my girlfriend, Naomi, of course.
160820	163620	I think we finished this article, though, didn't we?
163620	164620	I think that's all done.
164620	166660	Let's go on to the next one.
166660	170020	White America's need for white heroes.
170020	173980	This is obviously about the Cobrington Catholic megakids.
173980	178340	They began the week decked out in red hats and having a widely viewed confrontation with
178340	182900	a lone elderly indigenous man standing between them and a group of black activists following
182900	184620	an anti-abortion rally.
184620	188180	That's quite the washed opinion of everything that happened, eh?
188180	190160	Now they've been invited to the White House.
190160	192220	Why are they being invited to the White House?
192220	195220	They're being invited to the White House because they're white and because they're boosting
195220	196980	the President's brand.
196980	201380	And because inviting them to the White House makes them a symbol once more, for a President
201380	205420	who wields such symbols like a weapon because he lacks anything else and because he knows
205420	209180	how his supporters devour such things.
209180	211420	Holy fuck, dude.
211420	215300	Maybe it's because they were victims of a massive media smear campaign that did not
215300	217080	care about the truth at all?
217080	221640	These young men are now the red-hatted symbol of an entitled white privilege that perpetually
221640	222940	sees itself as righteous.
222940	224940	Hold on a minute, aren't you white?
224940	229340	I'm just gonna, like, you look reasonably white.
229340	231940	Oh wait, Pavlovitz.
231940	235960	I'm gonna guess, I'm just gonna guess here that you're white when it's convenient and
235960	238700	you're Jewish when it's convenient, aren't you?
238700	243220	This week, conservative politicians, partisan media, and the President himself rushed in
243220	248700	with the supposed smoking gun of an extended video that apparently exonerated the students
248700	253740	and served as some gotcha moment that indicated the fake news of the left.
253740	255240	That is not reality.
255240	257520	This is what gaslighters do.
257520	261660	Create an alternate reality and then try to make you lose faith in your eyes and then
261660	262860	your sanity.
262860	267820	Are you claiming the video was fucking doctored?
267820	275380	I mean, if the extended video is real, if it wasn't, like, put on, if it wasn't just
275380	280100	something that someone made up, but it's actually a real video, then that is reality.
280100	281360	That is in fact reality.
281360	286420	And what you initially saw was it was also reality, but it was an edited, cut-down version
286420	287420	of it.
287420	291420	It sounds like what you're complaining about is that reality is not lining up to your initial
291420	293080	reaction of what happened.
293080	296680	The longer video still reveals everything the initial clip did.
296680	302060	Poorly chaperoned entitled white kids wearing a symbol of supremacy and acting very questionably
302060	304000	at a rally they clearly had no interest in.
304000	309160	Man, I hope this guy doesn't have kids, because if he does, he's going to suck the fun right
309160	310800	out of their lives.
310800	311800	Really chaperoned.
311800	317880	Yeah, you mean the most fun parts of being a teenager is when the adults aren't around
317880	319280	constantly henpecking you?
319280	321180	A symbol of supremacy?
321180	325720	I'm sorry, but the MAGA hat is not like the KKK hood.
325720	327400	It's not like the Nazi armband.
327400	331340	I know you really, really want it to be that way, but it's not.
331340	336160	They still had no business on a school outing decked out in MAGA hats, given how divisive
336160	338600	and politically loaded those hats are to so many.
338600	340120	You see, I hate this logic.
340120	342280	I hate this fucking logic, because you know what?
342280	349140	If you have an idea, you have some kind of idea that is taboo but still necessary for
349140	355440	society to discuss, and then you just make all symbolism or all symbology of the idea
355440	361200	to be divisive and politically loaded, that is an attempt at censorship.
361200	366000	It means that we don't want you talking about this idea, and so we are going to object to
366000	370400	any shorthand of the idea as being an offensive symbol.
370400	372780	So let's say that they traded out their MAGA hats for something else.
372780	376120	Let's say they just traded out for a build the wall t-shirt.
376120	377840	Oh, you're going to complain about that, aren't you?
377840	379880	It's going to be divisive and politically loaded.
379880	384200	How about just a t-shirt that says, stop illegal immigration?
384200	386620	You're probably still going to fucking find something about that.
386620	393040	The meltdown of the radical left over the slogan, make America great again, which is
393040	399280	in itself not an offensive slogan, shows that they don't actually care about the slogan,
399280	401840	but they care about censoring the idea behind it.
401840	406460	They had no business engaging a group of screaming activists or counter protesters or a lone
406460	410840	indigenous man playing a drum while mocking him, for any reason.
410840	413400	You had no reason to be there.
413400	414400	Just fuck off.
414400	415640	It's a public space.
415640	418880	You know, they were on a school outing at the Lincoln Memorial.
418880	420440	That's reason enough to be there.
420440	421440	No, no.
421440	422440	It's like, fuck, fuck you.
422440	423440	You shouldn't, you shouldn't have been there.
423440	427080	You shouldn't have been the unfortunate victim of the media yet again.
427080	429560	Oh God, this, this whole thing is fucking stupid.
429560	432960	This is quite literally the definition of victim blaming you guys.
432960	434360	The story hasn't changed.
434360	435780	Yeah, it's changed.
435780	439260	It's changed because they were the victims and you don't like that.
439260	443960	And now they merit a White House invitation as if they are civil rights heroes or maligned
443960	444960	patriots.
444960	448400	As it turns out, they are.
448440	451400	This is the fundamental difference though, is that they are those things.
451400	461000	And they're those things because strangely enough, conservatism, especially younger conservatives
461000	466320	and youth conservatism is on the out in our society now.
466320	467960	That is the counterculture.
467960	472600	And when they get oppressed and they stand up for their rights, that they become civil
472600	473600	rights heroes.
473600	476500	They become maligned patriots.
476500	481820	It's so strange to think about because it has never happened before in my lifespan.
481820	486740	It's probably never happened before in the past 50 years, but still here we are.
486740	491640	It's like that common joke of how do you be edgy on campus nowadays, be a conservative
491640	493620	because everyone's doing all the hippie shit now.
493620	496780	The right's nonsensical narrative is thick with cognitive dissonance.
496780	501380	The lone unarmed elderly man intimidated the dozens of high school students.
501380	506060	Now see, I don't think anyone's saying that they intimidated the high school students.
506060	507340	That would be dumb.
507340	512660	I think the unarmed elderly man tried to intimidate the high school students and none of them
512660	513960	were buying it.
513960	518840	The fact that they were standing there laughing at his attempt shows that they were not being
518840	519840	intimidated.
519840	522860	Nobody thought that the old native guy with a drum was a threat.
522860	526540	Everyone was laughing at the fact that he acted like he was a threat when he was not.
526540	530500	You should try an America where we can call out the poor behavior of young white men without
530500	534020	saying we hate them or that we're dehumanizing them without claiming we're calling for their
534020	536420	heads without it being a partisan witch hunt.
536420	541580	You know, fair enough, but this was not a case where young white men behaved poorly
541580	543860	and you just can't fucking accept that.
543860	545100	Let's go overseas though.
545100	551940	To revenge rape, Pakistani council order sister of accused rapist to be raped as punishment.
551940	555820	I know this is a bit older, right?
555820	557420	I just got handed the article.
557420	565140	I hope at some point Sargon did an all cultures are beautiful video on this because holy shit
565140	566140	guys.
566140	567140	Yeah, this is how you dispense justice.
567140	569020	This is the way to fucking do it.
569020	572940	There is another horrific rape report from Pakistan where village elders ordered a revenge
572940	574740	rape as a punishment.
574740	578980	After a man was accused of raping a woman, the village council formed and ordered the
578980	582440	sister of the accused to be raped by the brother of his victim as justice.
582440	585260	They all then reportedly watched the rape.
585260	592820	Oh my, see everyone who says that individualism or, or, or classical liberalism doesn't work.
592820	598540	This is why any form of collectivism, whether it be social justice, whether it be religious
598540	604420	conservatism, whether it be Islam, whether it be white nationalism or, or anything else,
604420	608520	they don't work because they allow shit like this.
608520	613640	When you treat people as individuals, then harming the accused family as punishment for
613640	619580	their crimes is unacceptable, and it is only unacceptable under individualism.
619580	624640	But if you are your family, if you are your friends, if you are your spouse, your kids,
624640	630400	your race, or your religion, then you can just harm uninvolved people.
630400	633840	These crimes are often ordered by councils known as a jirga that enforce Islamic justice.
633840	638320	In 2002, a jirga ordered the gang up of a 28 year old after her 12 year old brother
638320	640560	was accused of an affair with an older woman.
640560	644680	Notably, the victim of the second rape was also arrested.
644680	645680	What?
645680	646680	Why?
646680	651840	Islamic councils have previously ordered revenge rapes.
651840	655740	One such case occurred last year in Multan, Pakistan.
655740	660160	Some 20 people were arrested after a 16 year old girl was ordered to be raped by the brother
660160	665040	of a 12 year old girl who was previously raped by the 16 year old's brother.
665040	666920	Jesus Christ.
666920	671120	Again, the elders and family watched the second rape.
671120	674640	In that case, however, the mothers of the two girls filed complaints.
674640	680520	In this case, the council appeared composed largely of the two families reaching an agreement
680520	684560	on just punishment in using an innocent girl to be raped.
684560	690460	I will never accept the hypothesis that all cultures are beautiful.
690460	691460	Fuck that.
691460	695400	Let's finish up with something lighthearted over at Hard Drive.
695400	702180	Real school bully has no idea he's creating future polygon video content creator.
702180	703180	It really is true.
703180	706960	A lot of the game journos out there seem like they were probably bullied as kids and now
706960	711760	they're using their little bits of power that they've managed to accumulate as adults to
711760	715520	bully others themselves just because they can't fucking deal with it.
715520	721760	I'm sure when those people back during gamergate said things like gamer should be bullied again,
721760	726640	they were probably just releasing some old catharsis.
726640	730320	Local bully Justin Marwall was reportedly unaware that the child he was picking on in
730320	735360	his 8th grade class, Chris Stevenson, will go on to make popular video content for the
735360	738000	website Polygon in 15 years.
738000	740900	Hold on, Polygon?
740900	742900	Popular video content?
742900	746940	They've got 650,000 subs, it's more than me.
746940	748020	And you know what?
748020	750080	Some of these videos are actually kind of popular.
750080	752720	When you hit the six figures, you know, you're doing okay.
752720	755960	So you know, good job, I'm actually kind of surprised.
755960	760760	There's definitely some variation though, there's like 11k here, 189k there, one of
760760	767440	the ones up here has 1.5 million, yeah here it is, the Skyrim books video, there's definitely
767440	768440	some variation.
768440	775480	I was definitely expecting something more like Feminist Frequency with 222k subs and
775480	782800	they barely get the fuck out of 1000 views per video, Jesus Christ.
782800	787620	My channel is doing better than this, and I have like, what, one eighth the sub count?
787620	791580	It's an age old adage, you have to be careful who you make fun of as a kid because you never
791580	795720	know who's YouTube video explaining how the Zelda timeline matches up with the episodes
795720	801220	of Frasier you'll be chuckling to in a decade, said Martha Harbinson, a teacher at Marwell's
801220	803300	and Stevenson's middle school.
803300	806800	There was this one kid I used to bully relentlessly when I was in middle school.
806800	811340	Now he's a streamer with 800 subs on Twitch, and you bet there's egg on my face.
811340	814880	According to close sources at the middle...
814880	819620	You know, they could almost be describing me.
819620	823140	According to close sources at the middle school, Stevenson, the future content creation starlet
823140	824860	often keeps to himself.
824860	828660	Yeah, kids were picking on him at recess the other day because he was sitting by himself
828660	833260	playing Nintendo Switch, said a lunch monitor Arthur Parsons while cleaning up some trash
833260	834900	in the school's cafeteria.
834900	839420	I hate seeing kids bullied so I sat him down and explained that he's going to be okay.
839420	842580	Chris is a smart kid and one day he might be Justin's boss.
842580	847940	Or even better, he'll funnel years of video game expertise and social torment into a fun,
847940	852340	quirky personality that people will relate to during 20 minute voiceovers for content
852340	856880	creation giants Polygon and Vox, Parsons continued.
856880	860960	People love that self-deprecation shit online and it's pretty hard to fake.
860960	864740	At press time, Stevenson was seen editing together clips of himself being bullied into
864740	871280	a meaty but lighthearted video entitled, The Strength of Justin Marwall's Fists Explained,
871280	872880	Bullied Episode 8.
872880	876800	You know, this is obviously a joke article, but I still really enjoy it.
876800	881240	And I just gotta say, if there's anyone here who's watching that's younger and you are
881240	884080	getting bullied, the honest truth is don't worry about it.
884080	885400	I got bullied in school.
885400	887520	I came out pretty much fine.
887520	892360	I certainly don't suffer from self-esteem issues as people around me can attest to.
892360	895360	And if it's really starting to bother you, if you're really starting to have some problems
895360	901400	with it, you have to realize that school is like a walled garden and it's safe and it's
901400	904260	confining but there's no freedom there.
904260	908440	And when you get out of school, as long as you're willing to take a few chances, leave
908440	913640	some of the old memories and some of the old traumas behind, you know, kind of pony up
913640	916440	and get on with your life, you will be fine.
916440	917760	Things will be okay.
917760	919520	It's not going to be hell forever.
919520	921080	It just seems like it right now.
921080	924000	And you don't even need to worry about the bullies because there are probably other people
924000	925360	in your life that care about you.
925360	926840	Focus on them.
926840	930600	And hey, if you have nobody that cares about you, then you should know that I care about
930600	931600	you.
931600	933100	Anyway, that's it for me, my friends.
933100	935020	I'm getting out of here.
