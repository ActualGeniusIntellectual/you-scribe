00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Hello my friends, welcome to SJ Weekly.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,240
No coffee sip today, it's too late in the day for me to be having coffee.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,240
You guys missed it.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,800
But I have been munching on crackers the past few minutes, so maybe you guys can have a

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,000
cracker or two with me.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Mmm, pretty good.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,260
I have to say guys, thank you very much for all the support you've shown me.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,440
The channel's blown up in the past week.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,320
I've been getting over a thousand subs a day for the past three or four days now.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,720
People are watching the videos at unprecedented rates, and I do really appreciate everyone's

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,560
support and enthusiasm.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,940
It's pretty incredible, I'm not gonna lie.

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,560
And because of this, I am working on something big to commemorate.

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,000
So let's get through today's articles, I only chose four because it has to be a slightly

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,080
shorter video since I'm quite busy, but let's take a look at them.

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,120
First up on the Telegraph, Melania Trump, an apology.

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,740
Following last Saturday's Telegraph magazine cover story, The Mystery of Melania, we have

18
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,280
been asked to make clear that the article contained a number of false statements, which

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,880
we accept should not have been published.

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,280
Really, on the one hand it's a good thing that they're, you know, admitting when they

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,280
went wrong.

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,040
On the other hand, why did they publish them without verifying them?

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,080
You're a fucking news organization.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,840
Mrs Trump's father was not a fearsome presence and he did not control the family.

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,920
Mrs Trump did not leave her design and architecture course at university relating to the completion

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,080
of an exam, as alleged in the article, but rather because she wanted to pursue a successful

27
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,200
career as a professional model.

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,320
Mrs Trump was not struggling in her modeling career before she met Mr Trump, and she did

29
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,080
not advance in her career due to the assistance of Mr Trump.

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,780
These things have been consistent claims about Melania, actually, and it's quite hypocritical

31
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,300
to hear them come from the far left because they're all about sex positivity until a woman

32
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,340
who has actually done sex work becomes the first lady of the United States.

33
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,300
Then they turn into the level of prudes that you only see on the religious right.

34
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,500
We apologize unreservedly to the first lady and her family for any embarrassment caused

35
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,040
by our publication of these allegations.

36
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,400
As a mark of regret, we have agreed to pay Mrs Trump substantial damages as well as her

37
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,500
legal costs.

38
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,060
You know, good on them.

39
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,060
Good on them.

40
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,060
Hmm?

41
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,060
What?

42
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,060
What's up?

43
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
I'm doing the video!

44
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,820
Well, you should have fucking started when you said you were gonna!

45
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,820
God damn it, Naomi!

46
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,820
What?

47
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,820
You fucking what?

48
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,820
Ow!

49
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,820
Ow!

50
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,820
Don't tickle me!

51
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,820
Ahahahaha!

52
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,820
Stop!

53
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
Alright, well, I'm back.

54
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,820
We can blame all that lost time on my girlfriend, Naomi, of course.

55
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,620
I think we finished this article, though, didn't we?

56
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,620
I think that's all done.

57
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,660
Let's go on to the next one.

58
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,020
White America's need for white heroes.

59
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,980
This is obviously about the Cobrington Catholic megakids.

60
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,340
They began the week decked out in red hats and having a widely viewed confrontation with

61
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,900
a lone elderly indigenous man standing between them and a group of black activists following

62
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,620
an anti-abortion rally.

63
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,180
That's quite the washed opinion of everything that happened, eh?

64
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,160
Now they've been invited to the White House.

65
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,220
Why are they being invited to the White House?

66
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,220
They're being invited to the White House because they're white and because they're boosting

67
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,980
the President's brand.

68
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,380
And because inviting them to the White House makes them a symbol once more, for a President

69
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,420
who wields such symbols like a weapon because he lacks anything else and because he knows

70
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,180
how his supporters devour such things.

71
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,420
Holy fuck, dude.

72
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,300
Maybe it's because they were victims of a massive media smear campaign that did not

73
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,080
care about the truth at all?

74
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,640
These young men are now the red-hatted symbol of an entitled white privilege that perpetually

75
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,940
sees itself as righteous.

76
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,940
Hold on a minute, aren't you white?

77
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,340
I'm just gonna, like, you look reasonably white.

78
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,940
Oh wait, Pavlovitz.

79
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,960
I'm gonna guess, I'm just gonna guess here that you're white when it's convenient and

80
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,700
you're Jewish when it's convenient, aren't you?

81
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,220
This week, conservative politicians, partisan media, and the President himself rushed in

82
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,700
with the supposed smoking gun of an extended video that apparently exonerated the students

83
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,740
and served as some gotcha moment that indicated the fake news of the left.

84
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,240
That is not reality.

85
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,520
This is what gaslighters do.

86
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,660
Create an alternate reality and then try to make you lose faith in your eyes and then

87
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,860
your sanity.

88
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,820
Are you claiming the video was fucking doctored?

89
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:35,380
I mean, if the extended video is real, if it wasn't, like, put on, if it wasn't just

90
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,100
something that someone made up, but it's actually a real video, then that is reality.

91
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,360
That is in fact reality.

92
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,420
And what you initially saw was it was also reality, but it was an edited, cut-down version

93
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,420
of it.

94
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,420
It sounds like what you're complaining about is that reality is not lining up to your initial

95
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,080
reaction of what happened.

96
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,680
The longer video still reveals everything the initial clip did.

97
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,060
Poorly chaperoned entitled white kids wearing a symbol of supremacy and acting very questionably

98
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,000
at a rally they clearly had no interest in.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,160
Man, I hope this guy doesn't have kids, because if he does, he's going to suck the fun right

100
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,800
out of their lives.

101
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Really chaperoned.

102
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,880
Yeah, you mean the most fun parts of being a teenager is when the adults aren't around

103
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,280
constantly henpecking you?

104
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,180
A symbol of supremacy?

105
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,720
I'm sorry, but the MAGA hat is not like the KKK hood.

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,400
It's not like the Nazi armband.

107
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,340
I know you really, really want it to be that way, but it's not.

108
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,160
They still had no business on a school outing decked out in MAGA hats, given how divisive

109
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,600
and politically loaded those hats are to so many.

110
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,120
You see, I hate this logic.

111
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,280
I hate this fucking logic, because you know what?

112
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:49,140
If you have an idea, you have some kind of idea that is taboo but still necessary for

113
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:55,440
society to discuss, and then you just make all symbolism or all symbology of the idea

114
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,200
to be divisive and politically loaded, that is an attempt at censorship.

115
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,000
It means that we don't want you talking about this idea, and so we are going to object to

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,400
any shorthand of the idea as being an offensive symbol.

117
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,780
So let's say that they traded out their MAGA hats for something else.

118
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,120
Let's say they just traded out for a build the wall t-shirt.

119
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,840
Oh, you're going to complain about that, aren't you?

120
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,880
It's going to be divisive and politically loaded.

121
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,200
How about just a t-shirt that says, stop illegal immigration?

122
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,620
You're probably still going to fucking find something about that.

123
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:33,040
The meltdown of the radical left over the slogan, make America great again, which is

124
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:39,280
in itself not an offensive slogan, shows that they don't actually care about the slogan,

125
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,840
but they care about censoring the idea behind it.

126
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,460
They had no business engaging a group of screaming activists or counter protesters or a lone

127
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,840
indigenous man playing a drum while mocking him, for any reason.

128
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,400
You had no reason to be there.

129
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Just fuck off.

130
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,640
It's a public space.

131
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,880
You know, they were on a school outing at the Lincoln Memorial.

132
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,440
That's reason enough to be there.

133
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
No, no.

134
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
It's like, fuck, fuck you.

135
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
You shouldn't, you shouldn't have been there.

136
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,080
You shouldn't have been the unfortunate victim of the media yet again.

137
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,560
Oh God, this, this whole thing is fucking stupid.

138
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,960
This is quite literally the definition of victim blaming you guys.

139
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,360
The story hasn't changed.

140
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,780
Yeah, it's changed.

141
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,260
It's changed because they were the victims and you don't like that.

142
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,960
And now they merit a White House invitation as if they are civil rights heroes or maligned

143
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
patriots.

144
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,400
As it turns out, they are.

145
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,400
This is the fundamental difference though, is that they are those things.

146
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:41,000
And they're those things because strangely enough, conservatism, especially younger conservatives

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,320
and youth conservatism is on the out in our society now.

148
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,960
That is the counterculture.

149
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,600
And when they get oppressed and they stand up for their rights, that they become civil

150
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
rights heroes.

151
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,500
They become maligned patriots.

152
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,820
It's so strange to think about because it has never happened before in my lifespan.

153
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,740
It's probably never happened before in the past 50 years, but still here we are.

154
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,640
It's like that common joke of how do you be edgy on campus nowadays, be a conservative

155
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,620
because everyone's doing all the hippie shit now.

156
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,780
The right's nonsensical narrative is thick with cognitive dissonance.

157
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,380
The lone unarmed elderly man intimidated the dozens of high school students.

158
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,060
Now see, I don't think anyone's saying that they intimidated the high school students.

159
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,340
That would be dumb.

160
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:32,660
I think the unarmed elderly man tried to intimidate the high school students and none of them

161
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,960
were buying it.

162
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,840
The fact that they were standing there laughing at his attempt shows that they were not being

163
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
intimidated.

164
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,860
Nobody thought that the old native guy with a drum was a threat.

165
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,540
Everyone was laughing at the fact that he acted like he was a threat when he was not.

166
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,500
You should try an America where we can call out the poor behavior of young white men without

167
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,020
saying we hate them or that we're dehumanizing them without claiming we're calling for their

168
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,420
heads without it being a partisan witch hunt.

169
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,580
You know, fair enough, but this was not a case where young white men behaved poorly

170
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,860
and you just can't fucking accept that.

171
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,100
Let's go overseas though.

172
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:11,940
To revenge rape, Pakistani council order sister of accused rapist to be raped as punishment.

173
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,820
I know this is a bit older, right?

174
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,420
I just got handed the article.

175
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:25,140
I hope at some point Sargon did an all cultures are beautiful video on this because holy shit

176
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,140
guys.

177
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,140
Yeah, this is how you dispense justice.

178
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,020
This is the way to fucking do it.

179
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,940
There is another horrific rape report from Pakistan where village elders ordered a revenge

180
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,740
rape as a punishment.

181
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,980
After a man was accused of raping a woman, the village council formed and ordered the

182
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,440
sister of the accused to be raped by the brother of his victim as justice.

183
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,260
They all then reportedly watched the rape.

184
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:52,820
Oh my, see everyone who says that individualism or, or, or classical liberalism doesn't work.

185
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,540
This is why any form of collectivism, whether it be social justice, whether it be religious

186
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:04,420
conservatism, whether it be Islam, whether it be white nationalism or, or anything else,

187
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,520
they don't work because they allow shit like this.

188
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,640
When you treat people as individuals, then harming the accused family as punishment for

189
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:19,580
their crimes is unacceptable, and it is only unacceptable under individualism.

190
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,640
But if you are your family, if you are your friends, if you are your spouse, your kids,

191
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,400
your race, or your religion, then you can just harm uninvolved people.

192
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,840
These crimes are often ordered by councils known as a jirga that enforce Islamic justice.

193
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,320
In 2002, a jirga ordered the gang up of a 28 year old after her 12 year old brother

194
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,560
was accused of an affair with an older woman.

195
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,680
Notably, the victim of the second rape was also arrested.

196
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,680
What?

197
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
Why?

198
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,840
Islamic councils have previously ordered revenge rapes.

199
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,740
One such case occurred last year in Multan, Pakistan.

200
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,160
Some 20 people were arrested after a 16 year old girl was ordered to be raped by the brother

201
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,040
of a 12 year old girl who was previously raped by the 16 year old's brother.

202
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,920
Jesus Christ.

203
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,120
Again, the elders and family watched the second rape.

204
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,640
In that case, however, the mothers of the two girls filed complaints.

205
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,520
In this case, the council appeared composed largely of the two families reaching an agreement

206
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,560
on just punishment in using an innocent girl to be raped.

207
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,460
I will never accept the hypothesis that all cultures are beautiful.

208
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,460
Fuck that.

209
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,400
Let's finish up with something lighthearted over at Hard Drive.

210
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:42,180
Real school bully has no idea he's creating future polygon video content creator.

211
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,180
It really is true.

212
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,960
A lot of the game journos out there seem like they were probably bullied as kids and now

213
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,760
they're using their little bits of power that they've managed to accumulate as adults to

214
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,520
bully others themselves just because they can't fucking deal with it.

215
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,760
I'm sure when those people back during gamergate said things like gamer should be bullied again,

216
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,640
they were probably just releasing some old catharsis.

217
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,320
Local bully Justin Marwall was reportedly unaware that the child he was picking on in

218
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,360
his 8th grade class, Chris Stevenson, will go on to make popular video content for the

219
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,000
website Polygon in 15 years.

220
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,900
Hold on, Polygon?

221
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,900
Popular video content?

222
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,940
They've got 650,000 subs, it's more than me.

223
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,020
And you know what?

224
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,080
Some of these videos are actually kind of popular.

225
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,720
When you hit the six figures, you know, you're doing okay.

226
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,960
So you know, good job, I'm actually kind of surprised.

227
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,760
There's definitely some variation though, there's like 11k here, 189k there, one of

228
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:47,440
the ones up here has 1.5 million, yeah here it is, the Skyrim books video, there's definitely

229
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
some variation.

230
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:55,480
I was definitely expecting something more like Feminist Frequency with 222k subs and

231
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:02,800
they barely get the fuck out of 1000 views per video, Jesus Christ.

232
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,620
My channel is doing better than this, and I have like, what, one eighth the sub count?

233
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,580
It's an age old adage, you have to be careful who you make fun of as a kid because you never

234
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,720
know who's YouTube video explaining how the Zelda timeline matches up with the episodes

235
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,220
of Frasier you'll be chuckling to in a decade, said Martha Harbinson, a teacher at Marwell's

236
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,300
and Stevenson's middle school.

237
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,800
There was this one kid I used to bully relentlessly when I was in middle school.

238
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,340
Now he's a streamer with 800 subs on Twitch, and you bet there's egg on my face.

239
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,880
According to close sources at the middle...

240
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,620
You know, they could almost be describing me.

241
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,140
According to close sources at the middle school, Stevenson, the future content creation starlet

242
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,860
often keeps to himself.

243
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,660
Yeah, kids were picking on him at recess the other day because he was sitting by himself

244
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,260
playing Nintendo Switch, said a lunch monitor Arthur Parsons while cleaning up some trash

245
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,900
in the school's cafeteria.

246
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,420
I hate seeing kids bullied so I sat him down and explained that he's going to be okay.

247
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,580
Chris is a smart kid and one day he might be Justin's boss.

248
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,940
Or even better, he'll funnel years of video game expertise and social torment into a fun,

249
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,340
quirky personality that people will relate to during 20 minute voiceovers for content

250
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,880
creation giants Polygon and Vox, Parsons continued.

251
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,960
People love that self-deprecation shit online and it's pretty hard to fake.

252
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,740
At press time, Stevenson was seen editing together clips of himself being bullied into

253
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:31,280
a meaty but lighthearted video entitled, The Strength of Justin Marwall's Fists Explained,

254
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,880
Bullied Episode 8.

255
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,800
You know, this is obviously a joke article, but I still really enjoy it.

256
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,240
And I just gotta say, if there's anyone here who's watching that's younger and you are

257
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,080
getting bullied, the honest truth is don't worry about it.

258
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,400
I got bullied in school.

259
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,520
I came out pretty much fine.

260
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,360
I certainly don't suffer from self-esteem issues as people around me can attest to.

261
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,360
And if it's really starting to bother you, if you're really starting to have some problems

262
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,400
with it, you have to realize that school is like a walled garden and it's safe and it's

263
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,260
confining but there's no freedom there.

264
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,440
And when you get out of school, as long as you're willing to take a few chances, leave

265
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,640
some of the old memories and some of the old traumas behind, you know, kind of pony up

266
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,440
and get on with your life, you will be fine.

267
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,760
Things will be okay.

268
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,520
It's not going to be hell forever.

269
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,080
It just seems like it right now.

270
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,000
And you don't even need to worry about the bullies because there are probably other people

271
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,360
in your life that care about you.

272
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,840
Focus on them.

273
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,600
And hey, if you have nobody that cares about you, then you should know that I care about

274
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
you.

275
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,100
Anyway, that's it for me, my friends.

276
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,020
I'm getting out of here.

277
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:39,320
As I said at the start of the episode, thank you very much for all the recent support.

278
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,560
It is very overwhelming and I'm quite humbled to see it.

279
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,280
Have fun, guys.

280
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,640
I love you.
