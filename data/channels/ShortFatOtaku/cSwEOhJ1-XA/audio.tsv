0	4240	Hello my friends, I'm back from traveling around for nearly 4 days, and one of the things
4240	6880	I did when I was gone was check out the new Joker film.
6880	10840	There'll be some spoilers in here, so feel free to not watch this video if you intend
10840	12280	to go see the movie yourself.
12280	14360	And I'll just say you should go see it.
14360	15360	Alright?
15360	16720	The spoilers begin.
16720	20880	Even though the movie is all about the Joker, in my opinion the metanarrative revolves around
20880	25000	Thomas Wayne, the father of the kid that will eventually become Batman.
25000	27960	The film's set in the 80s, and Bruce Wayne is still a child.
28000	31720	There's no Batman, and Gotham's rogues gallery doesn't exist yet.
31720	36000	One of the universal truths of the Batman mythos is that the deaths of Thomas and Martha
36000	40000	Wayne set into motion a series of events that influenced Bruce into becoming Batman as an
40000	41260	adult years later.
41260	45640	The stories are almost always told from Batman's point of view, or at least a point of view
45640	50000	sympathetic to him, so we only really get to see Thomas Wayne in a positive light, as
50000	53640	generally a good father whose untimely death haunts his son.
53640	55680	But in Joker we get to see it from either side.
55880	60240	It's left somewhat ambiguous what kind of a man Thomas Wayne is this time around.
60240	64840	The mother of Arthur Fleck, Phoenix's Joker character, is extremely manipulative and abusive
64840	65840	towards him.
65840	69560	There's evidence that he's the illegitimate son of Thomas Wayne, but there's also evidence
69560	73720	that his mother is simply making it up to try and get some of that Wayne family money.
73720	78480	It smacks of Michael Jackson's own early MeToo moment, where a delusional fan accused
78480	82120	him of fathering her child and abandoning them, an experience that eventually inspired
82120	83600	the song Billie Jean.
83600	85000	It's not just that though.
85000	89360	Antifa-style riots break out across Gotham inspired by the Joker's activities, where
89360	93340	the people assault the cops and call the rich fascists and so on, it's a very eat the rich
93340	95560	kind of mentality on display here.
95560	99400	Wayne Enterprise suits kick the shit out of the downtrodden for fun, and it's implied
99400	104520	that the city's rich, the Wayne family included, just do not care about the rampant poverty
104520	105520	in the city.
105520	110240	So, when random rioters gun down Thomas and Martha Wayne, it's not really presented as
110240	113480	a tragic moment in a young boy's life, although it obviously is.
113480	117540	But rather, the logical consequence of letting resentment fester in a large underclass of
117540	118920	disenfranchised people.
118920	123400	A recurring message in the film regarding the 1% is, they deserved it.
123400	127960	On the surface, this portrayal of the Wayne family makes Joker feel like a piece of revolutionary
127960	131520	left propaganda, and you'd be excused if you thought this was the case based on my
131520	132640	description alone.
132640	137200	But as it turns out, all the usual suspects, the revolutionary communists, the Antifa supporters,
137200	140800	the SJWs, the journalists, none of them are supporting this film.
140800	141800	They all hate it.
141800	145500	They're either doing their best to talk about how awful they think it is, or scare-mongering
145500	149880	constantly about how Joker is going to inspire more incels to commit more shootings.
149880	151960	And that's really the linchpin in this conversation.
151960	152960	The incels.
152960	157360	Joker is labeled as a film sympathetic to incels, or more specifically, sympathetic
157360	160480	to shooters, because it shows how the shooters are created.
160480	165240	It's very easy for the radical left to simply believe that toxic masculinity, and only toxic
165240	166920	masculinity, is the problem.
166920	170680	That incels are stamped with the word problematic on their forehead the day they are born.
170880	174060	That it's something inherent in their blood, their DNA, their makeup.
174060	177840	That each and every single one of them is incapable of change, and therefore simply
177840	180800	must be suppressed with all the force we can muster.
180800	184740	This attitude can be properly summed up by Emma Gonzalez, a survivor of the Stoneman
184740	185740	Douglas school shooting.
185740	193320	Those talking about how we should have not ostracized him, you didn't know this kid!
193320	197040	It's obvious she feels the ostracization of the shooter that attacked her school was
197040	198560	justified by his behavior.
198920	200680	And I don't know, maybe it was.
200680	203160	But how much of his behavior was something innate to him?
203160	207080	And how much of it was the logical end result of a negative feedback loop reinforced by
207080	208080	Emma and others?
208080	211640	I'm not saying that the shooter isn't responsible for his actions, he obviously
211640	212640	is.
212640	216340	But think back to my video, The Tyranny of Guilt, where I put forward the idea that acceptable
216340	221200	collective guilt doesn't mean guilt along racial or gender lines or whatever, but rather
221200	225600	an extreme form of individual guilt where you wonder what kind of dumb decisions you
225600	228640	made that might have set another person on the wrong path.
228640	230600	Yeah, this is one of those times.
230600	233360	In my opinion this is also the central thesis of Joker.
233360	237520	The eponymous character is already living in poverty, he gets beat up by people around
237520	242160	him for fun, he's abused by his mother, he loses access to his medication because social
242160	246560	programs are cut, and he inadvertently starts a revolution where thousands of other underclass
246560	250600	people begin to worship him, when it really seems like deep down the only thing he wants
250600	252980	is for somebody else to actually care about him.
252980	257360	He is, of course, responsible for everything he does, but if you don't think that some
257360	262420	responsibility is also on the shoulders of those around him who mistreat him, then you've
262420	264740	probably got an ideology that you want to push.
264740	269480	The radical left views incels as an unknowable quantity, we cannot hope to understand their
269480	271700	thought processes, we can only destroy them.
271700	274440	There are incels in your company, what are you going to do about it?
274440	278380	If they're forced to admit that the incels are not born, but created, yes for the third
278380	283300	time they're responsible for their own actions, and yes, they also reinforce their own negative
283300	288880	feedback loops in their echo chambers on reddit and elsewhere, but also yes, society treats
288880	291020	lower class men like absolute shit.
291020	295260	I really wanted to avoid using the word society in this video, but it had to come up eventually.
295260	299740	If all of those yeses are true, then the social justice upper class would actually be somewhat
299740	301220	culpable for the problem.
301220	304340	That's the point of Joker and it's why the SJWs hate it.
304340	307980	Because let's be real here, at this point the institution is left wing.
307980	310060	The SJWs are in charge of a lot of stuff.
310060	312620	They are, to some degree, the 1%.
312620	315700	We've got conservative governments right now, sure, but a lot of corporations, especially
315700	318420	big tech, are swinging more and more to the left.
318420	322820	And these people are completely fine with Antifa's revolutionary eat the rich mentality,
322820	325520	because they still believe that they're not the establishment.
325520	329700	Joker is a film that shows them where that mentality leads now that they are the establishment,
329700	333420	and their political opponents have become the downtrodden, and they don't like it.
333420	337700	At this point the Antifa slogan might as well be, eat the rich until we become the rich,
337740	339300	then eat the poor.
339300	343500	Joker is a tale of a straight white man on the lowest rung of the ladder, driven partially
343500	345880	by his environment to commit heinous acts.
345880	349600	When things fall apart did this story for black people, the left loved it.
349600	354300	When countless movies and TV shows have depicted women brutalized by men and eventually striking
354300	356260	out, the left also loved it.
356260	359440	But show the male underclass undertaking the same journey?
359440	364060	Now it's problematic, both in universe and for what they fear it'll inspire in the
364060	365060	real world.
365060	367180	I don't want to make a blanket statement.
367180	371980	Some people really are just born so predisposed to violence and exploitation that there's
371980	373480	just no helping them.
373480	376160	And to be honest, I don't know what to do about those people.
376160	379320	But I would hazard a guess that that's not most shooters.
379320	384460	When you pathologize an entire class of people, regardless of their race or gender or anything
384460	388940	else, it is the height of arrogance to be stunned when they inevitably lash out.
388940	392820	For the long time, that was the left's biggest contribution to our culture.
392820	397100	Proletariat revolution, smashing the patriarchy, eradicating racism.
397100	401460	They're all different variations of an abused underclass of people, lashing out against
401460	402460	their oppressors.
402460	407000	But when it comes to the topic of disenfranchised men, that logic goes right out the window.
407000	410900	The only thing the radical left seems to want to do is continue the oppression.
410900	414700	And they either don't know or don't care that it's their actions creating the very
414700	416540	problem they claim to want to solve.
416540	420420	I'm just ranting now because this video is half scripted and half my impressions of
420420	421420	the movie if you can't tell.
421420	422420	It's a good movie.
422420	425620	But I don't think it's a call to action for incels.
425620	427920	Nor does it show the Joker in a positive light.
427920	430320	It's a story about how victims become abusers.
430320	433820	It's a story about how ostracizing people doesn't make them vanish, it makes them
433820	434820	radicalize.
434820	439240	And if you do that to enough people, they will eventually come back with a vengeance.
439240	442220	This is a story the left intuitively understands.
442220	444440	Because they tell it every time they speak.
444440	446580	This time around, they just don't like who it's about.
