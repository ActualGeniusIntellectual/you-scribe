00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Hello my friends, I'm back from traveling around for nearly 4 days, and one of the things

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,880
I did when I was gone was check out the new Joker film.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,840
There'll be some spoilers in here, so feel free to not watch this video if you intend

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,280
to go see the movie yourself.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,360
And I'll just say you should go see it.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,360
Alright?

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,720
The spoilers begin.

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,880
Even though the movie is all about the Joker, in my opinion the metanarrative revolves around

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,000
Thomas Wayne, the father of the kid that will eventually become Batman.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,960
The film's set in the 80s, and Bruce Wayne is still a child.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,720
There's no Batman, and Gotham's rogues gallery doesn't exist yet.

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,000
One of the universal truths of the Batman mythos is that the deaths of Thomas and Martha

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Wayne set into motion a series of events that influenced Bruce into becoming Batman as an

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,260
adult years later.

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,640
The stories are almost always told from Batman's point of view, or at least a point of view

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,000
sympathetic to him, so we only really get to see Thomas Wayne in a positive light, as

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,640
generally a good father whose untimely death haunts his son.

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,680
But in Joker we get to see it from either side.

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,240
It's left somewhat ambiguous what kind of a man Thomas Wayne is this time around.

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,840
The mother of Arthur Fleck, Phoenix's Joker character, is extremely manipulative and abusive

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
towards him.

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,560
There's evidence that he's the illegitimate son of Thomas Wayne, but there's also evidence

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,720
that his mother is simply making it up to try and get some of that Wayne family money.

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,480
It smacks of Michael Jackson's own early MeToo moment, where a delusional fan accused

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,120
him of fathering her child and abandoning them, an experience that eventually inspired

26
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,600
the song Billie Jean.

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,000
It's not just that though.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,360
Antifa-style riots break out across Gotham inspired by the Joker's activities, where

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,340
the people assault the cops and call the rich fascists and so on, it's a very eat the rich

30
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,560
kind of mentality on display here.

31
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,400
Wayne Enterprise suits kick the shit out of the downtrodden for fun, and it's implied

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,520
that the city's rich, the Wayne family included, just do not care about the rampant poverty

33
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
in the city.

34
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,240
So, when random rioters gun down Thomas and Martha Wayne, it's not really presented as

35
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,480
a tragic moment in a young boy's life, although it obviously is.

36
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,540
But rather, the logical consequence of letting resentment fester in a large underclass of

37
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,920
disenfranchised people.

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,400
A recurring message in the film regarding the 1% is, they deserved it.

39
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,960
On the surface, this portrayal of the Wayne family makes Joker feel like a piece of revolutionary

40
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,520
left propaganda, and you'd be excused if you thought this was the case based on my

41
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,640
description alone.

42
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,200
But as it turns out, all the usual suspects, the revolutionary communists, the Antifa supporters,

43
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,800
the SJWs, the journalists, none of them are supporting this film.

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
They all hate it.

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,500
They're either doing their best to talk about how awful they think it is, or scare-mongering

46
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,880
constantly about how Joker is going to inspire more incels to commit more shootings.

47
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,960
And that's really the linchpin in this conversation.

48
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
The incels.

49
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,360
Joker is labeled as a film sympathetic to incels, or more specifically, sympathetic

50
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,480
to shooters, because it shows how the shooters are created.

51
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,240
It's very easy for the radical left to simply believe that toxic masculinity, and only toxic

52
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,920
masculinity, is the problem.

53
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,680
That incels are stamped with the word problematic on their forehead the day they are born.

54
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,060
That it's something inherent in their blood, their DNA, their makeup.

55
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,840
That each and every single one of them is incapable of change, and therefore simply

56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,800
must be suppressed with all the force we can muster.

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,740
This attitude can be properly summed up by Emma Gonzalez, a survivor of the Stoneman

58
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,740
Douglas school shooting.

59
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:13,320
Those talking about how we should have not ostracized him, you didn't know this kid!

60
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,040
It's obvious she feels the ostracization of the shooter that attacked her school was

61
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,560
justified by his behavior.

62
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,680
And I don't know, maybe it was.

63
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,160
But how much of his behavior was something innate to him?

64
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,080
And how much of it was the logical end result of a negative feedback loop reinforced by

65
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
Emma and others?

66
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,640
I'm not saying that the shooter isn't responsible for his actions, he obviously

67
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
is.

68
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,340
But think back to my video, The Tyranny of Guilt, where I put forward the idea that acceptable

69
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,200
collective guilt doesn't mean guilt along racial or gender lines or whatever, but rather

70
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,600
an extreme form of individual guilt where you wonder what kind of dumb decisions you

71
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,640
made that might have set another person on the wrong path.

72
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,600
Yeah, this is one of those times.

73
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,360
In my opinion this is also the central thesis of Joker.

74
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,520
The eponymous character is already living in poverty, he gets beat up by people around

75
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,160
him for fun, he's abused by his mother, he loses access to his medication because social

76
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,560
programs are cut, and he inadvertently starts a revolution where thousands of other underclass

77
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,600
people begin to worship him, when it really seems like deep down the only thing he wants

78
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,980
is for somebody else to actually care about him.

79
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,360
He is, of course, responsible for everything he does, but if you don't think that some

80
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,420
responsibility is also on the shoulders of those around him who mistreat him, then you've

81
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,740
probably got an ideology that you want to push.

82
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,480
The radical left views incels as an unknowable quantity, we cannot hope to understand their

83
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,700
thought processes, we can only destroy them.

84
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,440
There are incels in your company, what are you going to do about it?

85
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,380
If they're forced to admit that the incels are not born, but created, yes for the third

86
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,300
time they're responsible for their own actions, and yes, they also reinforce their own negative

87
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,880
feedback loops in their echo chambers on reddit and elsewhere, but also yes, society treats

88
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,020
lower class men like absolute shit.

89
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,260
I really wanted to avoid using the word society in this video, but it had to come up eventually.

90
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,740
If all of those yeses are true, then the social justice upper class would actually be somewhat

91
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,220
culpable for the problem.

92
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,340
That's the point of Joker and it's why the SJWs hate it.

93
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,980
Because let's be real here, at this point the institution is left wing.

94
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,060
The SJWs are in charge of a lot of stuff.

95
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,620
They are, to some degree, the 1%.

96
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,700
We've got conservative governments right now, sure, but a lot of corporations, especially

97
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,420
big tech, are swinging more and more to the left.

98
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,820
And these people are completely fine with Antifa's revolutionary eat the rich mentality,

99
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,520
because they still believe that they're not the establishment.

100
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,700
Joker is a film that shows them where that mentality leads now that they are the establishment,

101
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,420
and their political opponents have become the downtrodden, and they don't like it.

102
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,700
At this point the Antifa slogan might as well be, eat the rich until we become the rich,

103
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,300
then eat the poor.

104
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,500
Joker is a tale of a straight white man on the lowest rung of the ladder, driven partially

105
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,880
by his environment to commit heinous acts.

106
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,600
When things fall apart did this story for black people, the left loved it.

107
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,300
When countless movies and TV shows have depicted women brutalized by men and eventually striking

108
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,260
out, the left also loved it.

109
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,440
But show the male underclass undertaking the same journey?

110
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,060
Now it's problematic, both in universe and for what they fear it'll inspire in the

111
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,060
real world.

112
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,180
I don't want to make a blanket statement.

113
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,980
Some people really are just born so predisposed to violence and exploitation that there's

114
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,480
just no helping them.

115
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,160
And to be honest, I don't know what to do about those people.

116
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,320
But I would hazard a guess that that's not most shooters.

117
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,460
When you pathologize an entire class of people, regardless of their race or gender or anything

118
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,940
else, it is the height of arrogance to be stunned when they inevitably lash out.

119
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,820
For the long time, that was the left's biggest contribution to our culture.

120
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,100
Proletariat revolution, smashing the patriarchy, eradicating racism.

121
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,460
They're all different variations of an abused underclass of people, lashing out against

122
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,460
their oppressors.

123
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,000
But when it comes to the topic of disenfranchised men, that logic goes right out the window.

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,900
The only thing the radical left seems to want to do is continue the oppression.

125
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,700
And they either don't know or don't care that it's their actions creating the very

126
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,540
problem they claim to want to solve.

127
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,420
I'm just ranting now because this video is half scripted and half my impressions of

128
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,420
the movie if you can't tell.

129
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,420
It's a good movie.

130
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,620
But I don't think it's a call to action for incels.

131
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,920
Nor does it show the Joker in a positive light.

132
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,320
It's a story about how victims become abusers.

133
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,820
It's a story about how ostracizing people doesn't make them vanish, it makes them

134
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,820
radicalize.

135
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,240
And if you do that to enough people, they will eventually come back with a vengeance.

136
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,220
This is a story the left intuitively understands.

137
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,440
Because they tell it every time they speak.

138
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,580
This time around, they just don't like who it's about.
