00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
Hello my friends, I'm back from traveling around for nearly 4 days, and one of the things

00:04.240 --> 00:06.880
I did when I was gone was check out the new Joker film.

00:06.880 --> 00:10.840
There'll be some spoilers in here, so feel free to not watch this video if you intend

00:10.840 --> 00:12.280
to go see the movie yourself.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.360
And I'll just say you should go see it.

00:14.360 --> 00:15.360
Alright?

00:15.360 --> 00:16.720
The spoilers begin.

00:16.720 --> 00:20.880
Even though the movie is all about the Joker, in my opinion the metanarrative revolves around

00:20.880 --> 00:25.000
Thomas Wayne, the father of the kid that will eventually become Batman.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.960
The film's set in the 80s, and Bruce Wayne is still a child.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.720
There's no Batman, and Gotham's rogues gallery doesn't exist yet.

00:31.720 --> 00:36.000
One of the universal truths of the Batman mythos is that the deaths of Thomas and Martha

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
Wayne set into motion a series of events that influenced Bruce into becoming Batman as an

00:40.000 --> 00:41.260
adult years later.

00:41.260 --> 00:45.640
The stories are almost always told from Batman's point of view, or at least a point of view

00:45.640 --> 00:50.000
sympathetic to him, so we only really get to see Thomas Wayne in a positive light, as

00:50.000 --> 00:53.640
generally a good father whose untimely death haunts his son.

00:53.640 --> 00:55.680
But in Joker we get to see it from either side.

00:55.880 --> 01:00.240
It's left somewhat ambiguous what kind of a man Thomas Wayne is this time around.

01:00.240 --> 01:04.840
The mother of Arthur Fleck, Phoenix's Joker character, is extremely manipulative and abusive

01:04.840 --> 01:05.840
towards him.

01:05.840 --> 01:09.560
There's evidence that he's the illegitimate son of Thomas Wayne, but there's also evidence

01:09.560 --> 01:13.720
that his mother is simply making it up to try and get some of that Wayne family money.

01:13.720 --> 01:18.480
It smacks of Michael Jackson's own early MeToo moment, where a delusional fan accused

01:18.480 --> 01:22.120
him of fathering her child and abandoning them, an experience that eventually inspired

01:22.120 --> 01:23.600
the song Billie Jean.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.000
It's not just that though.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.360
Antifa-style riots break out across Gotham inspired by the Joker's activities, where

01:29.360 --> 01:33.340
the people assault the cops and call the rich fascists and so on, it's a very eat the rich

01:33.340 --> 01:35.560
kind of mentality on display here.

01:35.560 --> 01:39.400
Wayne Enterprise suits kick the shit out of the downtrodden for fun, and it's implied

01:39.400 --> 01:44.520
that the city's rich, the Wayne family included, just do not care about the rampant poverty

01:44.520 --> 01:45.520
in the city.

01:45.520 --> 01:50.240
So, when random rioters gun down Thomas and Martha Wayne, it's not really presented as

01:50.240 --> 01:53.480
a tragic moment in a young boy's life, although it obviously is.

01:53.480 --> 01:57.540
But rather, the logical consequence of letting resentment fester in a large underclass of

01:57.540 --> 01:58.920
disenfranchised people.

01:58.920 --> 02:03.400
A recurring message in the film regarding the 1% is, they deserved it.

02:03.400 --> 02:07.960
On the surface, this portrayal of the Wayne family makes Joker feel like a piece of revolutionary

02:07.960 --> 02:11.520
left propaganda, and you'd be excused if you thought this was the case based on my

02:11.520 --> 02:12.640
description alone.

02:12.640 --> 02:17.200
But as it turns out, all the usual suspects, the revolutionary communists, the Antifa supporters,

02:17.200 --> 02:20.800
the SJWs, the journalists, none of them are supporting this film.

02:20.800 --> 02:21.800
They all hate it.

02:21.800 --> 02:25.500
They're either doing their best to talk about how awful they think it is, or scare-mongering

02:25.500 --> 02:29.880
constantly about how Joker is going to inspire more incels to commit more shootings.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.960
And that's really the linchpin in this conversation.

02:31.960 --> 02:32.960
The incels.

02:32.960 --> 02:37.360
Joker is labeled as a film sympathetic to incels, or more specifically, sympathetic

02:37.360 --> 02:40.480
to shooters, because it shows how the shooters are created.

02:40.480 --> 02:45.240
It's very easy for the radical left to simply believe that toxic masculinity, and only toxic

02:45.240 --> 02:46.920
masculinity, is the problem.

02:46.920 --> 02:50.680
That incels are stamped with the word problematic on their forehead the day they are born.

02:50.880 --> 02:54.060
That it's something inherent in their blood, their DNA, their makeup.

02:54.060 --> 02:57.840
That each and every single one of them is incapable of change, and therefore simply

02:57.840 --> 03:00.800
must be suppressed with all the force we can muster.

03:00.800 --> 03:04.740
This attitude can be properly summed up by Emma Gonzalez, a survivor of the Stoneman

03:04.740 --> 03:05.740
Douglas school shooting.

03:05.740 --> 03:13.320
Those talking about how we should have not ostracized him, you didn't know this kid!

03:13.320 --> 03:17.040
It's obvious she feels the ostracization of the shooter that attacked her school was

03:17.040 --> 03:18.560
justified by his behavior.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.680
And I don't know, maybe it was.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.160
But how much of his behavior was something innate to him?

03:23.160 --> 03:27.080
And how much of it was the logical end result of a negative feedback loop reinforced by

03:27.080 --> 03:28.080
Emma and others?

03:28.080 --> 03:31.640
I'm not saying that the shooter isn't responsible for his actions, he obviously

03:31.640 --> 03:32.640
is.

03:32.640 --> 03:36.340
But think back to my video, The Tyranny of Guilt, where I put forward the idea that acceptable

03:36.340 --> 03:41.200
collective guilt doesn't mean guilt along racial or gender lines or whatever, but rather

03:41.200 --> 03:45.600
an extreme form of individual guilt where you wonder what kind of dumb decisions you

03:45.600 --> 03:48.640
made that might have set another person on the wrong path.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.600
Yeah, this is one of those times.

03:50.600 --> 03:53.360
In my opinion this is also the central thesis of Joker.

03:53.360 --> 03:57.520
The eponymous character is already living in poverty, he gets beat up by people around

03:57.520 --> 04:02.160
him for fun, he's abused by his mother, he loses access to his medication because social

04:02.160 --> 04:06.560
programs are cut, and he inadvertently starts a revolution where thousands of other underclass

04:06.560 --> 04:10.600
people begin to worship him, when it really seems like deep down the only thing he wants

04:10.600 --> 04:12.980
is for somebody else to actually care about him.

04:12.980 --> 04:17.360
He is, of course, responsible for everything he does, but if you don't think that some

04:17.360 --> 04:22.420
responsibility is also on the shoulders of those around him who mistreat him, then you've

04:22.420 --> 04:24.740
probably got an ideology that you want to push.

04:24.740 --> 04:29.480
The radical left views incels as an unknowable quantity, we cannot hope to understand their

04:29.480 --> 04:31.700
thought processes, we can only destroy them.

04:31.700 --> 04:34.440
There are incels in your company, what are you going to do about it?

04:34.440 --> 04:38.380
If they're forced to admit that the incels are not born, but created, yes for the third

04:38.380 --> 04:43.300
time they're responsible for their own actions, and yes, they also reinforce their own negative

04:43.300 --> 04:48.880
feedback loops in their echo chambers on reddit and elsewhere, but also yes, society treats

04:48.880 --> 04:51.020
lower class men like absolute shit.

04:51.020 --> 04:55.260
I really wanted to avoid using the word society in this video, but it had to come up eventually.

04:55.260 --> 04:59.740
If all of those yeses are true, then the social justice upper class would actually be somewhat

04:59.740 --> 05:01.220
culpable for the problem.

05:01.220 --> 05:04.340
That's the point of Joker and it's why the SJWs hate it.

05:04.340 --> 05:07.980
Because let's be real here, at this point the institution is left wing.

05:07.980 --> 05:10.060
The SJWs are in charge of a lot of stuff.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.620
They are, to some degree, the 1%.

05:12.620 --> 05:15.700
We've got conservative governments right now, sure, but a lot of corporations, especially

05:15.700 --> 05:18.420
big tech, are swinging more and more to the left.

05:18.420 --> 05:22.820
And these people are completely fine with Antifa's revolutionary eat the rich mentality,

05:22.820 --> 05:25.520
because they still believe that they're not the establishment.

05:25.520 --> 05:29.700
Joker is a film that shows them where that mentality leads now that they are the establishment,

05:29.700 --> 05:33.420
and their political opponents have become the downtrodden, and they don't like it.

05:33.420 --> 05:37.700
At this point the Antifa slogan might as well be, eat the rich until we become the rich,

05:37.740 --> 05:39.300
then eat the poor.

05:39.300 --> 05:43.500
Joker is a tale of a straight white man on the lowest rung of the ladder, driven partially

05:43.500 --> 05:45.880
by his environment to commit heinous acts.

05:45.880 --> 05:49.600
When things fall apart did this story for black people, the left loved it.

05:49.600 --> 05:54.300
When countless movies and TV shows have depicted women brutalized by men and eventually striking

05:54.300 --> 05:56.260
out, the left also loved it.

05:56.260 --> 05:59.440
But show the male underclass undertaking the same journey?

05:59.440 --> 06:04.060
Now it's problematic, both in universe and for what they fear it'll inspire in the

06:04.060 --> 06:05.060
real world.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.180
I don't want to make a blanket statement.

06:07.180 --> 06:11.980
Some people really are just born so predisposed to violence and exploitation that there's

06:11.980 --> 06:13.480
just no helping them.

06:13.480 --> 06:16.160
And to be honest, I don't know what to do about those people.

06:16.160 --> 06:19.320
But I would hazard a guess that that's not most shooters.

06:19.320 --> 06:24.460
When you pathologize an entire class of people, regardless of their race or gender or anything

06:24.460 --> 06:28.940
else, it is the height of arrogance to be stunned when they inevitably lash out.

06:28.940 --> 06:32.820
For the long time, that was the left's biggest contribution to our culture.

06:32.820 --> 06:37.100
Proletariat revolution, smashing the patriarchy, eradicating racism.

06:37.100 --> 06:41.460
They're all different variations of an abused underclass of people, lashing out against

06:41.460 --> 06:42.460
their oppressors.

06:42.460 --> 06:47.000
But when it comes to the topic of disenfranchised men, that logic goes right out the window.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.900
The only thing the radical left seems to want to do is continue the oppression.

06:50.900 --> 06:54.700
And they either don't know or don't care that it's their actions creating the very

06:54.700 --> 06:56.540
problem they claim to want to solve.

06:56.540 --> 07:00.420
I'm just ranting now because this video is half scripted and half my impressions of

07:00.420 --> 07:01.420
the movie if you can't tell.

07:01.420 --> 07:02.420
It's a good movie.

07:02.420 --> 07:05.620
But I don't think it's a call to action for incels.

07:05.620 --> 07:07.920
Nor does it show the Joker in a positive light.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.320
It's a story about how victims become abusers.

07:10.320 --> 07:13.820
It's a story about how ostracizing people doesn't make them vanish, it makes them

07:13.820 --> 07:14.820
radicalize.

07:14.820 --> 07:19.240
And if you do that to enough people, they will eventually come back with a vengeance.

07:19.240 --> 07:22.220
This is a story the left intuitively understands.

07:22.220 --> 07:24.440
Because they tell it every time they speak.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.580
This time around, they just don't like who it's about.
