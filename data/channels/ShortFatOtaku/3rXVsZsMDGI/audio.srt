00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
BIDENFLATION

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,240
Biden inflation is changing people's lives.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,000
Fact check, it's Bidenflation, not Putinflation.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,620
Summer of Bidenflation means hardship, high prices for Americans.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,080
High prices are costing families $5,000 more this year.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,900
Everybody's talking about the current inflation crisis as being a product of Biden's administration,

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,600
how it's his and the Democrats' greatest disaster, and how it's going to lead to

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,000
their inevitable downfall in 2022 and 2024.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,480
Though I have a feeling that the Democrats aren't going to perform very well in the

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,840
midterms, the 2024 presidential race remains to be seen.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,600
But nonetheless, the moniker of Bidenflation, like Obamacare before it, seems to have stuck.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,320
But how much of the inflation is actually Biden's, or more broadly, the Democrats'

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
fault?

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
Let's check it out.

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,520
Firstly, let's ask the question, how much inflation has there actually been?

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,680
Well, the numbers in the USA, Canada, and Europe all point to around 5-6% inflation

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,420
in 2021, and 7-9% inflation so far in 2022, with the historic average being 1-2%.

18
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,480
For example, in February the inflation rate was 7.8, in March 8.5, in April 6.8, in May

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:15,080
8.6, in June 9.1, and for July so far we're estimated at around 8%.

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,480
Let's take 8 as an easy number to work with.

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,720
Dean Baker from the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research says that 2%

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,920
of inflation, approximately one-quarter of that 8, was caused by Biden's American

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,400
Rescue Plan, or the ARP, which the Republicans deride for printing about $2 trillion as stimulus

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,380
to bail out pretty much everybody from the COVID crisis.

25
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:40,000
Douglas Holtz-Eakin from the right-leaning American Action Forum estimates that about

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,560
4% of inflation, approximately one-half of that 8, was caused by the ARP, and this range

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,880
between one-quarter and one-half is where most economists place their calculations.

28
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,580
Michael Strain from the libertarian-leaning American Enterprise Institute guesses that

29
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,380
the ARP caused about one-third of inflation.

30
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,300
Jason Furman, professor at Harvard, says that inflation in America is 4% higher, that's

31
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,540
one-half, than countries in Europe, which did not implement a comparable stimulus as

32
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,540
the ARP.

33
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:11,020
So it does indeed seem like the inflation was partially caused by the Biden administration's

34
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,020
American Rescue Plan.

35
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,140
And we can see this pretty starkly on an inflation graph.

36
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,300
Inflation begins moving beyond the 2% upper limit in March 2021, which is the month that

37
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,220
the ARP was passed, and continues to skyrocket with no end in sight.

38
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,060
But inflation is not entirely caused by the ARP.

39
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,540
Some people on the left say that inflation is caused by the war in Ukraine, and that

40
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,020
Bidenflation is just rhetoric and cope from the Republicans.

41
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,380
We can examine that claim too.

42
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,020
In an article by Corrado Macarelli, an associate professor at Brunel University, he estimates

43
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,700
that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to an increase in oil prices by 30%, gas prices

44
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:49,020
in Europe by 90%, and food prices by 17%, because Ukraine was a net exporter of grain

45
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,020
and corn.

46
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,020
The food price increase will also cause a price increase in biofuels down the line.

47
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,840
Macarelli ultimately estimates that the war in Ukraine will add about 2% to global inflation

48
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,640
in 2022, and 1% in 2023.

49
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,160
The Federal Reserve's own analysis comes to a lower number, 1.3%, but for the exact

50
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,320
same reasons.

51
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,180
So it may very well be the case that anywhere from one-fifth to one-fourth of that 8% inflation

52
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,940
number we're seeing right now, 1.5% to 2%, could be caused by the war in Ukraine.

53
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,380
The left also likes to blame the COVID supply chain crisis.

54
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,140
We can check that claim out too, no problem.

55
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,960
Here's a graph of global supply chain pressures.

56
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,020
That first big hump is the initial 2020 lockdown, where no one knew what was going on, China

57
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,680
was shutting down everything like crazy, world travel was being affected, everyone was told

58
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,580
to stop going into work and stay indoors.

59
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,080
The second larger hump happened at the same time as the inflation peak.

60
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,460
So let's consider the possibility.

61
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,060
Why would supply chain pressure cause inflation?

62
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,220
This graph runs from 1960 to 2020, and it shows the individual consumption of durable

63
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,420
goods, non-durable goods, and services.

64
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,900
Non-durable goods are things that you buy and consume regularly, like food or gas.

65
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,460
Stuff that you can't just make a one-time purchase of.

66
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,700
Services are, well, when you pay other people to do stuff, that's obvious.

67
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,260
Durable goods are things that you only need to buy once in a while.

68
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,560
Cars, TVs, furniture, computers.

69
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,360
These are big purchases that you might only need to buy once every 5, 10, or 15 years.

70
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,340
What you should notice is that the durable goods purchases, the blue line, is significantly

71
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,920
more volatile than the others.

72
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,040
This makes sense, at least to me.

73
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,440
During a depression or a recession, most people will put off those big permanent purchases,

74
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,840
like cars or anything else, in order to prioritize non-durable goods, like food.

75
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,560
And when things are going good, we can expect to see spikes in durable purchases for the

76
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
same reason.

77
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,260
Case in point, the 2008 recession.

78
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,480
But once we add 2022's data to this graph, we notice that this current economic crisis

79
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,500
is rather unique.

80
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,660
We had the expected downturn around March of 2020, but by March of 2021, we had reached

81
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,920
record highs, disproportionate highs, on spending of durable goods.

82
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,620
In other words, people were spending more money than in any other point in history on

83
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,320
big ticket items, like cars and TVs and computers and whatever else.

84
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,980
There was a huge shift in consumer preferences.

85
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,980
Why?

86
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,580
Part of that, again, we can lay at the feet of the ARP.

87
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,960
If everyone's getting a fat stack deposited into the bank account, why not buy that new

88
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
TV or whatever?

89
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,960
Fair enough.

90
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,040
That's not the whole story.

91
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,340
With people working from home, that's less Starbucks coffees grabbed on the way to work

92
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,340
every day.

93
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,380
That's less pre-made sandwiches for lunch.

94
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,700
That's less restaurant visits.

95
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,100
That's less $22 slices of avocado toast.

96
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,880
And the incidental consumables market has been affected to the point that people who

97
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,220
create that overpriced slop are beginning to complain.

98
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,780
Even if we disregard the ARP stimulus, people's work habits have changed, which means that

99
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,460
people's incidental spending has also changed.

100
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,740
Less money spent on a lunch every day means more money in the bank available to spend,

101
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,400
and that money is being spent on durable goods.

102
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,800
In a way, back during the 2010s, when the boomers were telling millennials to stop eating

103
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,240
out and spending money on frivolous, temporary treats and delicacies so that they could actually

104
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,080
afford things like houses and cars, well, the boomers were right, except that a pandemic

105
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,120
forced everyone to do it all at once, and we're now seeing the end result of that shift

106
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,640
in behavior in the supply chain crunch.

107
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,780
And one final side point, I don't think that one sideways boat that turned into a meme

108
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,920
for a while had too big of an impact on the supply chain crunch and therefore inflation,

109
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,920
but you never know.

110
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,580
The Suez Canal is pretty important after all.

111
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,580
That reminds me, though.

112
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,140
I've described where the supply chain pressure comes from, but not really why it causes inflation.

113
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,740
When a supply chain experiences bottlenecks or droughts, goods aren't flowing at a steady

114
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,740
pace anymore.

115
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,000
This is called a shock.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,540
During a supply shock, prices go up because of a lack of availability.

117
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,940
Demand remains the same, but supply goes down, causing the remaining supply to be more valuable.

118
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,220
A great example of this is used car prices during the pandemic.

119
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,280
Due to a scarcity of semiconductors suitable for use in new computerized cars, there was

120
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,040
limited new car production.

121
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,460
With less new cars rolling out, used car prices skyrocketed.

122
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,460
During supply shocks that are widespread enough or strong enough, inflation goes up because

123
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,080
prices of everything go up, but at the same time, growth slows.

124
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,980
The companies producing the product ultimately have less capital to reinvest because they're

125
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,500
not producing as much, so they're not selling as much, and so the amount that they can put

126
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,160
back into the next production cycle is lower.

127
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,400
It becomes a death spiral.

128
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,300
However, during a demand shock, prices go up because of an increase in demand.

129
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,580
Supply remains the same, but demand goes up.

130
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,260
More people want to buy things.

131
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,020
In terms of the relative scarcity of remaining supply, this is the same situation as a supply

132
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,020
shock.

133
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,020
The supply becomes more valuable.

134
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,860
But there's another factor to consider beyond increased demand driving price increases.

135
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,340
Unlike with a supply shock, growth doesn't slow down during a demand shock if the companies

136
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,600
producing the products can keep production in line with the excess demand.

137
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,500
If they can, then growth actually begins to accelerate.

138
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,940
COVID lockdowns, paradoxically, created both a supply and demand shock.

139
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,160
Nobody was allowed to produce anything during the initial lockdowns.

140
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,520
Supply was constrained, causing prices to rise for the now-rare goods.

141
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,320
Then immediately after, before the supply chain had a chance to readjust after production

142
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,960
resumed, demand massively exploded for those two reasons that I mentioned earlier, the

143
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,820
ARP stimulus and the new spending habits promoted during lockdown living.

144
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,640
And then to top it off, right after that, we got a second, smaller supply shock, in

145
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,160
the form of the war in Ukraine.

146
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,780
This is why those estimates from earlier approximated the ARP as causing anywhere from 2% to 4% of

147
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,220
the total 8% of American inflation.

148
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,820
Reduced production during lockdown, different spending habits after lockdown, and the war

149
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,900
in Ukraine have also all contributed.

150
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,160
So for the sake of argument, let's give the anti-Biden people the best possible numbers.

151
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,220
Let's assume Biden's stimulus actually caused 4%, half of the inflation.

152
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:23,000
That leaves the other 4% to be divided among the war in Ukraine, lockdowns preventing production,

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,820
new spending habits, and the normal 1-2% background inflation.

154
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:33,140
The question is then, what did Americans get out of the ARP, and was it worth 4% inflation?

155
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,380
Well on February 24th, 2022, Moody's Analytics published Global Fiscal Policy in the Pandemic,

156
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:44,580
where they found that the ARP, 1, grew the GDP by 5.7% in 2021, which is approximately

157
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,540
3% more than without any stimulus.

158
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,540
Now a lot of people say that GDP is a bunk stat, because that tells you how well corporals

159
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,580
are doing, not people.

160
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,580
And fair enough.

161
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,580
So let's move on.

162
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,880
The ARP increased health insurance enrollment by 4.2 million, and kept 3.7 million children

163
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,460
out of poverty, though I think a lot of that second figure came from the Expanded Child

164
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,080
Tax Credit, which was a side piece of legislation, not the ARP proper.

165
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,320
Also, I understand that a lot of people are just ideologically opposed to the idea of

166
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,980
a tax-funded safety net.

167
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,320
And so bringing more people onto health insurance isn't a positive for them.

168
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,560
So let's move on to…

169
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
3.

170
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,960
Brought back 4 million jobs in 2021, and lowered unemployment by 2%.

171
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,600
Without the ARP, employment was on track to rise back over 7% in the middle of 2021

172
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
and remain there.

173
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,580
This is something that Republicans have to get behind, because jobs are their big thing.

174
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,320
They can disregard the GDP for good reasons, they can disregard the social safety net stuff

175
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,660
for meh reasons, but they can't disregard job growth.

176
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,700
Now Moody's report thinks that the ARP caused only 0.3% of the total inflation.

177
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,460
That is wildly out of line with everybody else's calculations.

178
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,900
And again, for the sake of argument, for strengthening the Republican side of the math, let's disregard

179
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,900
that figure.

180
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,300
The average Republican voter who doesn't care about the GDP and who is pretty lukewarm

181
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,140
on the idea of getting more people onto health insurance.

182
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,840
Was 4% inflation worth it to get 4 million jobs, 2% lowered unemployment, and the aversion

183
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,480
of a second Covid recession?

184
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,260
Are we better off with the inflation and those benefits than a world where we had 4% inflation

185
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,080
instead of 8, and in return, unemployment was pegged at over 7%?

186
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,940
There were 4 million fewer people working, and America was dealing with the Ukraine supply

187
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,120
shock during an even worse economic crisis?

188
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,920
I don't know about you, but I don't think so.

189
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,600
That's not to say that print money provides stimulus is the answer to every single economic

190
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
problem.

191
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,200
Sri Lanka has proven that it's not.

192
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,500
You can't just print and spend when your economy has no actual productive capacity.

193
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,720
But there does seem to be an argument that responsibly, prudently, printing money in

194
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,400
a limited, measured way operates like borrowing against future likely production, rather than

195
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,520
simply devaluing your currency in the present.

196
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,480
I already understand the argument that's coming out of the gold standard types in the

197
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
comments right now.

198
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,820
Your economy only has so much production, and your country has only so many dollars.

199
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,560
If suddenly, your government like Venezuela or Sri Lanka just prints a whole bunch of

200
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,700
money, they've increased the money supply without actually increasing the productive

201
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,120
capacity of their society.

202
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,000
This results in each individual unit of money representing less of the total amount of production.

203
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,160
Hence prices go up, and hence inflation.

204
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,160
Sometimes when nations do this, they do it out of ignorance and end up stupidly destroying

205
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,880
their economies with hyperinflation.

206
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,600
However, we have seen socialist countries, most notably the Soviet Union, use inflation

207
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
as a weapon.

208
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,200
Hemingway wrote about how the Bolsheviks deliberately ruined the Russian ruble in order to impoverish

209
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,900
money-holding people who did no actual labor.

210
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,000
After the bourgeois was done away with, the now-destroyed Russian ruble was replaced with

211
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,600
the gold-backed Soviet ruble.

212
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,800
The fact that money printing can be used as a weapon in this way is likely one of the

213
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,360
reasons that libertarians often refer to Keynesians as communists.

214
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,560
However, and this is what responsible governments try to do.

215
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,400
Let's assume that money is printed for a specific purpose.

216
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,900
Let's assume that I am an unproductive citizen, but I have an idea for a new business.

217
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,480
The government gives me a grant because my pitch sounds good.

218
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,820
The government prints me the money to fund my business.

219
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,260
Because money has been added to the supply without any change in productive capacity,

220
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,560
this should cause inflation.

221
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,720
But remember, I was unproductive before.

222
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,760
Let's assume that my business is actually productive.

223
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,520
I'm now working when I wasn't before.

224
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,400
Maybe I create jobs and hire people.

225
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,680
All of us are now producing when before we weren't.

226
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,760
In this way, the government's measured, responsible printing of money has increased

227
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,040
both the money supply and the productive capacity of society.

228
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,180
And with the ratio between the two remaining roughly equal, there's no inflation.

229
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,520
That is what borrowing against future-likely production is.

230
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,280
It's using printing money as a scalpel rather than, say, a chainsaw.

231
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,680
A responsible government can estimate where injecting money into the system is likely

232
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,240
to actually stimulate production in order to prevent or lessen inflation.

233
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,200
And during a crisis like COVID, where in the first few months we really didn't know

234
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,800
whether or not we were dealing with the cold or the black plague yet, an initial lockdown

235
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
seemed necessary.

236
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,480
And the ARP to restart production and borrow against the future production of a recovered

237
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,480
economy also seemed necessary.

238
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,800
So the final verdict, what caused inflation?

239
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:55,400
The best-case answer for Republicans is, around 50% of the inflation was in fact caused by

240
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,920
the Democrats passing the American Rescue Plan.

241
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,560
However, that plan came with multiple economic benefits along with the inflation and that

242
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,600
not passing it while lessening inflation would ultimately have left the economy in

243
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,020
a worse position.

244
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,480
Inflation is still a serious problem that Biden needs to solve, obviously.

245
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,760
But in an alternate universe, we probably would have been talking about the Biden economic

246
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,120
crash instead of Bidenflation.

247
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,960
And I don't know about you, but I think most people prefer living in this one.
