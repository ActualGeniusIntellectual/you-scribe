0	5920	BIDENFLATION
5920	8240	Biden inflation is changing people's lives.
8240	11000	Fact check, it's Bidenflation, not Putinflation.
11000	14620	Summer of Bidenflation means hardship, high prices for Americans.
14620	18080	High prices are costing families $5,000 more this year.
18080	22900	Everybody's talking about the current inflation crisis as being a product of Biden's administration,
22900	26600	how it's his and the Democrats' greatest disaster, and how it's going to lead to
26600	30000	their inevitable downfall in 2022 and 2024.
30000	33480	Though I have a feeling that the Democrats aren't going to perform very well in the
33480	36840	midterms, the 2024 presidential race remains to be seen.
36840	41600	But nonetheless, the moniker of Bidenflation, like Obamacare before it, seems to have stuck.
41600	45320	But how much of the inflation is actually Biden's, or more broadly, the Democrats'
45320	46320	fault?
46320	47320	Let's check it out.
47320	50520	Firstly, let's ask the question, how much inflation has there actually been?
50520	55680	Well, the numbers in the USA, Canada, and Europe all point to around 5-6% inflation
55680	62420	in 2021, and 7-9% inflation so far in 2022, with the historic average being 1-2%.
62420	68480	For example, in February the inflation rate was 7.8, in March 8.5, in April 6.8, in May
68480	75080	8.6, in June 9.1, and for July so far we're estimated at around 8%.
75080	77480	Let's take 8 as an easy number to work with.
77480	82720	Dean Baker from the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research says that 2%
82720	86920	of inflation, approximately one-quarter of that 8, was caused by Biden's American
86920	92400	Rescue Plan, or the ARP, which the Republicans deride for printing about $2 trillion as stimulus
92400	95380	to bail out pretty much everybody from the COVID crisis.
95380	100000	Douglas Holtz-Eakin from the right-leaning American Action Forum estimates that about
100000	104560	4% of inflation, approximately one-half of that 8, was caused by the ARP, and this range
104560	108880	between one-quarter and one-half is where most economists place their calculations.
108880	112580	Michael Strain from the libertarian-leaning American Enterprise Institute guesses that
112580	115380	the ARP caused about one-third of inflation.
115380	120300	Jason Furman, professor at Harvard, says that inflation in America is 4% higher, that's
120300	124540	one-half, than countries in Europe, which did not implement a comparable stimulus as
124540	125540	the ARP.
125540	131020	So it does indeed seem like the inflation was partially caused by the Biden administration's
131020	132020	American Rescue Plan.
132020	135140	And we can see this pretty starkly on an inflation graph.
135140	139300	Inflation begins moving beyond the 2% upper limit in March 2021, which is the month that
139300	143220	the ARP was passed, and continues to skyrocket with no end in sight.
143220	146060	But inflation is not entirely caused by the ARP.
146060	149540	Some people on the left say that inflation is caused by the war in Ukraine, and that
149540	153020	Bidenflation is just rhetoric and cope from the Republicans.
153020	154380	We can examine that claim too.
154380	159020	In an article by Corrado Macarelli, an associate professor at Brunel University, he estimates
159020	163700	that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to an increase in oil prices by 30%, gas prices
163700	169020	in Europe by 90%, and food prices by 17%, because Ukraine was a net exporter of grain
169020	170020	and corn.
170020	174020	The food price increase will also cause a price increase in biofuels down the line.
174020	178840	Macarelli ultimately estimates that the war in Ukraine will add about 2% to global inflation
178840	181640	in 2022, and 1% in 2023.
181640	186160	The Federal Reserve's own analysis comes to a lower number, 1.3%, but for the exact
186160	187320	same reasons.
187320	193180	So it may very well be the case that anywhere from one-fifth to one-fourth of that 8% inflation
193220	197940	number we're seeing right now, 1.5% to 2%, could be caused by the war in Ukraine.
197940	201380	The left also likes to blame the COVID supply chain crisis.
201380	203140	We can check that claim out too, no problem.
203140	205960	Here's a graph of global supply chain pressures.
205960	210020	That first big hump is the initial 2020 lockdown, where no one knew what was going on, China
210020	213680	was shutting down everything like crazy, world travel was being affected, everyone was told
213680	215580	to stop going into work and stay indoors.
215580	219080	The second larger hump happened at the same time as the inflation peak.
219080	220460	So let's consider the possibility.
220460	223060	Why would supply chain pressure cause inflation?
223060	228220	This graph runs from 1960 to 2020, and it shows the individual consumption of durable
228220	231420	goods, non-durable goods, and services.
231420	234900	Non-durable goods are things that you buy and consume regularly, like food or gas.
234900	237460	Stuff that you can't just make a one-time purchase of.
237460	240700	Services are, well, when you pay other people to do stuff, that's obvious.
240700	243260	Durable goods are things that you only need to buy once in a while.
243260	245560	Cars, TVs, furniture, computers.
245560	250360	These are big purchases that you might only need to buy once every 5, 10, or 15 years.
250360	254340	What you should notice is that the durable goods purchases, the blue line, is significantly
254340	255920	more volatile than the others.
255920	257040	This makes sense, at least to me.
257040	261440	During a depression or a recession, most people will put off those big permanent purchases,
261440	265840	like cars or anything else, in order to prioritize non-durable goods, like food.
265840	269560	And when things are going good, we can expect to see spikes in durable purchases for the
269560	270560	same reason.
270560	272260	Case in point, the 2008 recession.
272260	277480	But once we add 2022's data to this graph, we notice that this current economic crisis
277480	278500	is rather unique.
278500	283660	We had the expected downturn around March of 2020, but by March of 2021, we had reached
283660	287920	record highs, disproportionate highs, on spending of durable goods.
287920	291620	In other words, people were spending more money than in any other point in history on
291620	295320	big ticket items, like cars and TVs and computers and whatever else.
295320	297980	There was a huge shift in consumer preferences.
297980	298980	Why?
298980	301580	Part of that, again, we can lay at the feet of the ARP.
301580	304960	If everyone's getting a fat stack deposited into the bank account, why not buy that new
304960	305960	TV or whatever?
305960	306960	Fair enough.
306960	308040	That's not the whole story.
308580	311340	With people working from home, that's less Starbucks coffees grabbed on the way to work
311340	312340	every day.
312340	314380	That's less pre-made sandwiches for lunch.
314380	315700	That's less restaurant visits.
315700	318100	That's less $22 slices of avocado toast.
318100	321880	And the incidental consumables market has been affected to the point that people who
321880	325220	create that overpriced slop are beginning to complain.
325220	329780	Even if we disregard the ARP stimulus, people's work habits have changed, which means that
329780	332460	people's incidental spending has also changed.
332460	336740	Less money spent on a lunch every day means more money in the bank available to spend,
336760	339400	and that money is being spent on durable goods.
339400	342800	In a way, back during the 2010s, when the boomers were telling millennials to stop eating
342800	347240	out and spending money on frivolous, temporary treats and delicacies so that they could actually
347240	351080	afford things like houses and cars, well, the boomers were right, except that a pandemic
351080	355120	forced everyone to do it all at once, and we're now seeing the end result of that shift
355120	357640	in behavior in the supply chain crunch.
357640	361780	And one final side point, I don't think that one sideways boat that turned into a meme
361780	365920	for a while had too big of an impact on the supply chain crunch and therefore inflation,
365920	366920	but you never know.
366920	368580	The Suez Canal is pretty important after all.
368580	369580	That reminds me, though.
369580	374140	I've described where the supply chain pressure comes from, but not really why it causes inflation.
374140	378740	When a supply chain experiences bottlenecks or droughts, goods aren't flowing at a steady
378740	379740	pace anymore.
379740	381000	This is called a shock.
381000	384540	During a supply shock, prices go up because of a lack of availability.
384540	388940	Demand remains the same, but supply goes down, causing the remaining supply to be more valuable.
388940	392220	A great example of this is used car prices during the pandemic.
392220	396280	Due to a scarcity of semiconductors suitable for use in new computerized cars, there was
396280	398040	limited new car production.
398040	401460	With less new cars rolling out, used car prices skyrocketed.
401460	405460	During supply shocks that are widespread enough or strong enough, inflation goes up because
405460	409080	prices of everything go up, but at the same time, growth slows.
409080	412980	The companies producing the product ultimately have less capital to reinvest because they're
412980	416500	not producing as much, so they're not selling as much, and so the amount that they can put
416500	419160	back into the next production cycle is lower.
419160	420400	It becomes a death spiral.
420400	424300	However, during a demand shock, prices go up because of an increase in demand.
424300	426580	Supply remains the same, but demand goes up.
426580	428260	More people want to buy things.
428260	432020	In terms of the relative scarcity of remaining supply, this is the same situation as a supply
432020	433020	shock.
433020	434020	The supply becomes more valuable.
434020	437860	But there's another factor to consider beyond increased demand driving price increases.
437860	442340	Unlike with a supply shock, growth doesn't slow down during a demand shock if the companies
442340	445600	producing the products can keep production in line with the excess demand.
445600	448500	If they can, then growth actually begins to accelerate.
448500	452940	COVID lockdowns, paradoxically, created both a supply and demand shock.
452940	456160	Nobody was allowed to produce anything during the initial lockdowns.
456160	459520	Supply was constrained, causing prices to rise for the now-rare goods.
459520	463320	Then immediately after, before the supply chain had a chance to readjust after production
463320	466960	resumed, demand massively exploded for those two reasons that I mentioned earlier, the
466960	470820	ARP stimulus and the new spending habits promoted during lockdown living.
470820	474640	And then to top it off, right after that, we got a second, smaller supply shock, in
474640	476160	the form of the war in Ukraine.
476160	481780	This is why those estimates from earlier approximated the ARP as causing anywhere from 2% to 4% of
481780	484220	the total 8% of American inflation.
484220	487820	Reduced production during lockdown, different spending habits after lockdown, and the war
487820	489900	in Ukraine have also all contributed.
489900	494160	So for the sake of argument, let's give the anti-Biden people the best possible numbers.
494160	498220	Let's assume Biden's stimulus actually caused 4%, half of the inflation.
498220	503000	That leaves the other 4% to be divided among the war in Ukraine, lockdowns preventing production,
503000	506820	new spending habits, and the normal 1-2% background inflation.
506820	513140	The question is then, what did Americans get out of the ARP, and was it worth 4% inflation?
513140	518380	Well on February 24th, 2022, Moody's Analytics published Global Fiscal Policy in the Pandemic,
518380	524580	where they found that the ARP, 1, grew the GDP by 5.7% in 2021, which is approximately
524580	526540	3% more than without any stimulus.
526540	529540	Now a lot of people say that GDP is a bunk stat, because that tells you how well corporals
529540	530580	are doing, not people.
530580	531580	And fair enough.
531580	532580	So let's move on.
533160	536880	The ARP increased health insurance enrollment by 4.2 million, and kept 3.7 million children
536880	540460	out of poverty, though I think a lot of that second figure came from the Expanded Child
540460	544080	Tax Credit, which was a side piece of legislation, not the ARP proper.
544080	548320	Also, I understand that a lot of people are just ideologically opposed to the idea of
548320	549980	a tax-funded safety net.
549980	553320	And so bringing more people onto health insurance isn't a positive for them.
553320	554560	So let's move on to…
554560	555560	3.
555560	559960	Brought back 4 million jobs in 2021, and lowered unemployment by 2%.
559960	564600	Without the ARP, employment was on track to rise back over 7% in the middle of 2021
564600	565600	and remain there.
565600	569580	This is something that Republicans have to get behind, because jobs are their big thing.
569580	573320	They can disregard the GDP for good reasons, they can disregard the social safety net stuff
573320	576660	for meh reasons, but they can't disregard job growth.
576660	581700	Now Moody's report thinks that the ARP caused only 0.3% of the total inflation.
581700	584460	That is wildly out of line with everybody else's calculations.
584460	588900	And again, for the sake of argument, for strengthening the Republican side of the math, let's disregard
588900	589900	that figure.
589900	593300	The average Republican voter who doesn't care about the GDP and who is pretty lukewarm
593300	596140	on the idea of getting more people onto health insurance.
596140	601840	Was 4% inflation worth it to get 4 million jobs, 2% lowered unemployment, and the aversion
601840	603480	of a second Covid recession?
603480	608260	Are we better off with the inflation and those benefits than a world where we had 4% inflation
608260	612080	instead of 8, and in return, unemployment was pegged at over 7%?
612080	615940	There were 4 million fewer people working, and America was dealing with the Ukraine supply
615940	618120	shock during an even worse economic crisis?
618120	619920	I don't know about you, but I don't think so.
619920	623600	That's not to say that print money provides stimulus is the answer to every single economic
623600	624600	problem.
624600	626200	Sri Lanka has proven that it's not.
626200	630500	You can't just print and spend when your economy has no actual productive capacity.
630500	634720	But there does seem to be an argument that responsibly, prudently, printing money in
634720	639400	a limited, measured way operates like borrowing against future likely production, rather than
639400	641520	simply devaluing your currency in the present.
641520	644480	I already understand the argument that's coming out of the gold standard types in the
644480	645480	comments right now.
645480	649820	Your economy only has so much production, and your country has only so many dollars.
649820	653560	If suddenly, your government like Venezuela or Sri Lanka just prints a whole bunch of
653560	656700	money, they've increased the money supply without actually increasing the productive
656700	658120	capacity of their society.
658120	663000	This results in each individual unit of money representing less of the total amount of production.
663000	665160	Hence prices go up, and hence inflation.
665160	669160	Sometimes when nations do this, they do it out of ignorance and end up stupidly destroying
669160	670880	their economies with hyperinflation.
670880	675600	However, we have seen socialist countries, most notably the Soviet Union, use inflation
675600	676600	as a weapon.
676600	681200	Hemingway wrote about how the Bolsheviks deliberately ruined the Russian ruble in order to impoverish
681200	683900	money-holding people who did no actual labor.
683900	688000	After the bourgeois was done away with, the now-destroyed Russian ruble was replaced with
688000	689600	the gold-backed Soviet ruble.
689600	693800	The fact that money printing can be used as a weapon in this way is likely one of the
693800	697360	reasons that libertarians often refer to Keynesians as communists.
697360	700560	However, and this is what responsible governments try to do.
700560	703400	Let's assume that money is printed for a specific purpose.
703400	706900	Let's assume that I am an unproductive citizen, but I have an idea for a new business.
706900	709480	The government gives me a grant because my pitch sounds good.
709480	711820	The government prints me the money to fund my business.
711820	715260	Because money has been added to the supply without any change in productive capacity,
715260	716560	this should cause inflation.
716560	718720	But remember, I was unproductive before.
718720	720760	Let's assume that my business is actually productive.
720760	722520	I'm now working when I wasn't before.
722520	724400	Maybe I create jobs and hire people.
724400	726680	All of us are now producing when before we weren't.
726680	730760	In this way, the government's measured, responsible printing of money has increased
730760	734040	both the money supply and the productive capacity of society.
734040	738180	And with the ratio between the two remaining roughly equal, there's no inflation.
738180	741520	That is what borrowing against future-likely production is.
741520	745280	It's using printing money as a scalpel rather than, say, a chainsaw.
745280	749680	A responsible government can estimate where injecting money into the system is likely
749680	753240	to actually stimulate production in order to prevent or lessen inflation.
753240	757200	And during a crisis like COVID, where in the first few months we really didn't know
757200	760800	whether or not we were dealing with the cold or the black plague yet, an initial lockdown
760800	761800	seemed necessary.
761800	765480	And the ARP to restart production and borrow against the future production of a recovered
765480	767480	economy also seemed necessary.
767480	769800	So the final verdict, what caused inflation?
769800	775400	The best-case answer for Republicans is, around 50% of the inflation was in fact caused by
775400	777920	the Democrats passing the American Rescue Plan.
777920	782560	However, that plan came with multiple economic benefits along with the inflation and that
782560	786600	not passing it while lessening inflation would ultimately have left the economy in
786600	788020	a worse position.
788020	792480	Inflation is still a serious problem that Biden needs to solve, obviously.
792480	795760	But in an alternate universe, we probably would have been talking about the Biden economic
795760	797120	crash instead of Bidenflation.
797120	800960	And I don't know about you, but I think most people prefer living in this one.
