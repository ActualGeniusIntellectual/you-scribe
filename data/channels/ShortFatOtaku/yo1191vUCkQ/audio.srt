1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,620
I was on eFAP last week with a whole bunch of other guests to talk about the current

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,740
drama surrounding the React meta of Twitch.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,740
I had a really good time.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,740
I love going on eFAP.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,220
But large panels like this aren't always the best way to get a point across.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,260
That, plus I've had a bit of time to think about it, so I want to give a more nuanced

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,340
take regarding the topic.

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,700
To really understand what's going on, you have to watch like five videos on Destiny's

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,780
channel, and they're each several hours long.

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,460
And ain't nobody got time for that.

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,020
Let me give you a quick TLDR.

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,780
xQc and Hassan are two of the most popular streamers in the world.

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,380
Hassan is explicitly a socialist, while xQc seems to be more apolitical.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,300
They both got into a lot of controversy last week, when they reacted to Lomino's hour-and-a-half-long

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,820
documentary on the assassination of JFK.

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,560
Lomino is a YouTuber with over five million subs, and his bread and butter seems to be

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,020
highly researched, highly edited long-form videos like this.

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,900
xQc and Hassan both got into trouble for playing the entire video on their stream,

19
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,900
though xQc caught a lot more heat.

20
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,300
This sparked multiple debates across multiple channels about the ethics of reacting to other

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,100
people's content on stream, on Destiny's stream, on the E5 episode that I was a part

22
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,820
of, ultimately culminating with xQc going on to the H3H3 podcast to debate Ethan Klein

23
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,820
on the topic.

24
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,820
And you know what?

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,940
As much as I absolutely fucking hate Ethan Klein, I gotta hand it to him.

26
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,380
He stomped xQc into the dirt.

27
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,020
So when I say minimal commentary, how minimal are we talking here?

28
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,580
Well, xQc's reaction on stream was cut into a video by his editor and uploaded to his

29
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,580
YouTube channel.

30
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,820
That stream segment clocked in at one hour and fifty-three minutes.

31
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,620
Lomino's original video clocks in at an hour thirty-eight.

32
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,500
That means that if we give xQc any sort of time devoted to intro and outro, pre- and

33
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,420
post-discussion of the video, he added fifteen minutes of his own content to Lomino's video.

34
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,860
Is that enough for it to be considered ethical, or is this simply xQc stealing other people's

35
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,200
hard work and letting it run on his stream?

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,620
How about Hassan's reaction?

37
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,820
His VOD is two hours and twenty-three minutes.

38
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,920
Good faith assumption that he added forty-five minutes of his own commentary.

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,120
Is that enough for it to be considered ethical?

40
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,820
Lots of people look to fair use, which is an American legal argument.

41
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,960
Fair use permits the use of copyrighted material without permission from the owner under specific

42
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,660
circumstances for various artistic purposes.

43
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,880
Current American law has a four-point checklist that can help determine whether or not a use

44
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,380
of a copyrighted work is copyright infringement or is actually fair use.

45
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,620
When determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use,

46
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,260
the factors to be considered shall include 1.

47
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,420
The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature

48
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,140
or is for non-profit educational purposes 2.

49
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,220
The nature of the copyrighted work 3.

50
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,320
The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as

51
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,680
a whole 4.

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,240
The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work

53
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,220
Now to be clear, this isn't a hard and fast checklist.

54
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,780
Like, you don't have to tick off the four boxes for a use to be considered fair use.

55
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,000
It's judged on a case-by-case basis, because fair use is what is known as an affirmative

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
defense.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,420
An affirmative defense is, basically, when you don't dispute the facts of the case.

58
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,940
You make the argument that you had a really good reason to do what you did.

59
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,060
Self-defense is a great example of an affirmative defense.

60
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,040
For example, nobody disputes that Rittenhouse shot those people.

61
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,900
His defense is that he had a really good reason to do so, that he was under attack by them

62
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,020
and afraid for his life.

63
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,580
When you claim fair use, it's an affirmative defense.

64
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,860
You're not denying that you're using the copyrighted material.

65
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,980
You're claiming that you have a good reason to use it.

66
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,020
And these four points can help a judge determine whether or not your reason is actually a good

67
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,020
one.

68
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,440
Point one is basically about the social good of the use.

69
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,980
Are you just making a bunch of money ripping off somebody else's work?

70
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,920
Or are you not making any money and instead using it to educate?

71
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,140
Point two is taking into account what you used.

72
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,720
Using a song is different from using a movie, which is different from using a photo.

73
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,740
What the work is will help you determine whether or not your use of it was legitimate.

74
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,660
Point three is taking into account how much of the work you used.

75
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,660
If you're reviewing a movie, you probably shouldn't include the entire movie in your

76
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,900
review and only use the clips necessary to make your points.

77
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,300
But that doesn't mean that under the right circumstances, using a whole work wouldn't

78
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,300
be valid.

79
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,700
It depends on what you're doing with it and if it's necessary.

80
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,680
Point four is taking into account the loss of the copyright holder.

81
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,100
For example, I remember a fan-made project where you tour the Enterprise-D from Star

82
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,540
Trek Next Generation, which Paramount had successfully shut down as they had for sale

83
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,780
their own version doing the exact same thing.

84
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,140
In this case, the impact on the copyright holder is too much for it to be fair use.

85
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,620
The fan was literally providing a competing parallel product for free, depriving Paramount

86
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,620
of sales.

87
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,840
However, it's not as simple as whether or not a copyright holder is financially damaged

88
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,040
by the use, as a negative review of a movie might lead to the creators of the movie seeing

89
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,340
a financial loss.

90
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,220
A review is not a parallel product in the same way as recreating the entire thing.

91
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,820
Basically, fair use isn't a series of hard and fast rules that can be easily figured

92
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,460
out, but a set of guidelines that can help judge a use on a case-by-case basis.

93
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,840
For the UK and Canada and other English-speaking nations, we have fair dealing law instead,

94
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,780
which is mostly similar with a few key differences.

95
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,780
Here we've got a six-point system.

96
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,740
The purpose of the dealing, the character of the dealing, the amount of the dealing,

97
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,980
alternatives to the dealing, the nature of the work used, and the effect of the dealing

98
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,980
on the work.

99
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,660
These mostly cover the same thing as American fair use law.

100
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,580
This is all to say that fair use and fair dealing are legal terms, not moral or ethical

101
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,580
ones.

102
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,420
When people talk about this stuff, they often use these terms colloquially, in a moral sense,

103
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,420
not a legal one.

104
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,060
When something is found to be a fair use, it's considered transformative.

105
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,460
And the conversation surrounding XQC is all about whether or not his reaction was transformative.

106
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,100
Not explicitly in a legal way, but in a colloquial way.

107
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,940
Like are streamers doing anything unethical by just freebooting somebody else's YouTube

108
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,940
videos for their stream?

109
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,820
Let me draw out a logic tree here.

110
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,820
If you're watching me on your second monitor, now is the time to pause Baldur's Gate and

111
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,900
look over for a few minutes.

112
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,740
If Lomino gave the streamers his permission to watch his videos on their stream, then

113
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,060
the conversation is just over.

114
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,060
They got the creators' consent.

115
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,020
I don't think anybody sane would object to this.

116
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,100
What would they even say?

117
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,220
That they still can't watch other people's videos even if the creators said it was okay?

118
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,100
Well, actually, yes, but we'll get back to that in a bit.

119
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,940
If Lomino didn't give them his permission, then the question becomes, did they mix in

120
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,340
enough of their own original content, in a way that their reaction is now transformative?

121
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,140
Again, not legally, colloquially.

122
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,900
In the case of XQC, most people say no, he didn't.

123
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,500
Mahler highlighted on eFAP just how little XQC added during the viewing of his video,

124
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,660
along with pointing out that whenever he paused a comment, his own chat room would revolt,

125
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,300
screaming at him to stop pausing the video and stop adding his own input.

126
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,980
Those people were there less for XQC's reaction and more to just watch a YouTube video uninterrupted

127
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,320
on XQC's stream.

128
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,080
For Hassan's reaction, despite him walking off several times to do other things and just

129
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,300
letting the video play to his chat room in his empty chair, he did actually add his own

130
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,640
commentary significantly more than XQC did.

131
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,760
It was stupid commentary, yes, Hassan is a gibbering retard, but we're not judging

132
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,860
the quality of the commentary this time, we're only judging if they've actually transformed

133
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,160
the original work into a new experience.

134
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,640
And in this case, Hassan has a much stronger claim to that defense than XQC.

135
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,400
So where is that line that makes a use transformative, in the colloquial sense?

136
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,560
I personally think that the various eFAPs on movies and TV shows, as well as my own

137
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,940
watch party videos of the Rings of Power and The Last of Us, those are all transformative.

138
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,320
Because yes, while we are watching the whole show or the whole movie, there's significant

139
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,960
commentary before, during, and after, discussing news articles or social media trends surrounding

140
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,680
the show, bringing up lore inconsistencies or dumb scenes, or whatever else, sitting

141
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,800
there and simply saying true with your mouth full, or letting a video play while you wander

142
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,360
away to jack off in the bathroom, that's not transformative.

143
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,640
I can't tell you where the line is that makes something transformative when you cross

144
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
it.

145
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,500
I don't know exactly how much you should add, but I do know that there is an obvious

146
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,140
difference between the two extremes.

147
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,520
If a use isn't transformative, then how unethical is it?

148
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,660
Well, that depends.

149
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,740
This conversation has come up several times now in terms of internet discourse.

150
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,420
The last time it kicked off was a year ago.

151
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:42,020
Back then I was also on eFAP, talking about Hassan completely stealing one of JX's videos,

152
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,600
just letting it play providing almost no commentary whatsoever, and going over the dumb fuck defense

153
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,220
for this behavior given not only by Hassan himself, but also by A-Relevant and Denims.

154
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,180
And even before that, there was the Twitch TV meta, where large Twitch streamers would

155
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,420
just watch whole ass real TV shows, like the shit that you'd find on cable.

156
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,340
The argument given by these large streamers as to why they should be allowed to do this

157
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,300
makes me think that they view streaming like it's a watch party in Discord, which explains

158
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,760
why xQc's chat was yelling at him every time you paused the video.

159
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,260
These people often say that they should be allowed to do this because the product they're

160
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,600
presenting isn't the movie or the video or the TV show itself, it's the experience

161
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,300
of watching it with other people, with the streamer, with the chat room.

162
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,340
And on some level, we do know that that is a different experience, just like we know

163
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,800
the difference between watching a movie at home versus watching it in the theater.

164
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,360
But the fact that it's a different experience for the viewer, does that make it a transformative

165
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
use?

166
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
I don't think so.

167
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,160
Another common defense is to compare it to video game streaming.

168
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,880
The argument is that a streamer deprives a video's creator, or a movie's creator,

169
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,880
or a TV show's creator.

170
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,840
Though let's be honest, nobody gives a fuck about Hollywood's welfare right now.

171
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,440
The streamer deprives them revenues or attention or clicks when he plays their content on stream,

172
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,920
even if he reacts to it in a transformative way, let alone just freebooting it.

173
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,200
But since we allow it for video games, we should also allow it for other mediums.

174
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,300
The issue with this argument is that video games have a performative component.

175
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,260
You have to play it, not just passively consume it.

176
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,960
And a streamer's playthrough is necessarily different than yours.

177
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,860
The experience of playing a game cannot be gained through watching somebody else play

178
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,860
it.

179
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,020
But the experience of watching a video or a movie or a TV show can be gained by watching

180
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,540
it with somebody else present, like a streamer or a chat room.

181
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,460
The claim that watching somebody playing a video game is an infringement on the copyright

182
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,420
of the creator of the game doesn't really make sense.

183
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,220
It's like saying watching somebody play baseball is an infringement of the copyright

184
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,220
of the creator of baseball.

185
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,340
The only place where I think this logic has any footing is in games with almost no gameplay

186
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,340
whatsoever.

187
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,460
Like you're just passively moving through the game world applying zero skill and absorbing

188
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,460
a story.

189
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,100
At that point, it might as well just be a TV show.

190
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,140
But for the most part, this logic doesn't work for video game streams.

191
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,140
The final line of defense for this behavior is the effect that streaming somebody's

192
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,300
video has on the creator of the video.

193
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,620
The video creators will often claim that each person who watches it on Hassan's stream

194
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,020
or XQC's stream, that's one less potential view on their video.

195
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,320
Why would they go watch the original on YouTube when they just watch it on a stream?

196
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,660
This was Adam's main argument on Efab.

197
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,380
And I think there's some truth to it.

198
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,800
There obviously will be some people who would have watched the video who just won't now.

199
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,320
That's lost clicks and revenue.

200
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,020
Streamers can mitigate that by shouting out the creator, linking their video, linking

201
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,020
their channel.

202
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,020
But some of them just won't watch it.

203
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,020
Simple as.

204
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,900
But that calculation has to be balanced out by understanding that some people do go back

205
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,860
and watch it, as we regularly see videos get spikes of viewers after a streamer reacts

206
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,860
to it.

207
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,380
If any of those viewers are new viewers, they might sub to the channel, they might watch

208
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,860
future videos on their own.

209
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,740
These effects also have to be taken into account.

210
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,840
There's also the fact that there's generally a significant lack of audience overlap.

211
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,020
Going back to the original example, there's probably not much audience overlap between

212
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,700
Hassan and XQC's stream viewers and Lomino's YouTube viewers.

213
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,380
The chance of those people watching Lomino's content of their own volition is probably

214
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,580
relatively low.

215
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,560
But now that they've seen the JFK video on stream, they just might.

216
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,820
Something we learned during the era of MP3 piracy is that just because somebody downloads

217
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,980
your music, doesn't mean that that's automatically a lost sale.

218
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,340
Some of these people would have just never bought the music at all.

219
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,820
And some of these people would have just never watched Lomino either.

220
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,320
This is the harm conversation, and to me personally, it's the least interesting part of the discussion.

221
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,940
The question here is ultimately, how many views and subs are lost when somebody reacts

222
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,300
to their content on their stream versus how many are gained through exposure to a new

223
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,300
audience.

224
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,100
If you had perfect information, you can just math it out.

225
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,180
If the video creator gains more than they lose, it's not immoral for streamers to

226
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,180
swipe the video.

227
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,380
If the video creator loses more than they gain, it is immoral.

228
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,020
The only issue is that we don't have perfect information, so we're just guessing a lot

229
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,020
of this stuff.

230
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,060
But there's no real moral question here.

231
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,660
Assume that Lomino saw a net material gain from xQc grabbing his video and playing it

232
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,400
while not transforming it, essentially stealing the content to keep his stream entertained.

233
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,300
If Lomino saw a net material loss, it's an easy conversation.

234
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,900
What xQc did was simply unethical.

235
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,220
But if Lomino saw a net material gain, was what xQc did okay?

236
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,220
I'm not so sure.

237
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,500
Because, and sorry progressive consequentialist, you guys are retarded, not all morality is

238
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,500
based on harm reduction and seeking good ends.

239
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,300
Even if Lomino saw a material gain, it's not like he gave xQc his consent to play the

240
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,300
video.

241
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,380
And consent is a moral concept that exists outside of harm.

242
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,300
People can consent to harmful things and refuse non-harmful things.

243
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,940
It's a different type of morality than simple harm reduction.

244
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,820
If Lomino objected to xQc's use of the video, and xQc replied with, aw shut up, you gotta

245
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,980
benefit out of it anyway, and that was actually true, does that mean that xQc is morally in

246
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,980
the clear?

247
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,100
And Lomino has no place to feel put out.

248
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,340
My gut tells me, I don't think so.

249
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,560
So what's at the bottom of this?

250
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,060
To answer that, we gotta go all the way back to the start of React content itself.

251
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,220
The early internet is full of videos where the purpose of them is to see a person's

252
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,220
reaction.

253
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,900
The oldest one I can think of is the N64 kid.

254
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,060
Yeah that was me back when I got my N64 too.

255
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,260
The point of the video isn't the N64, it's the kid's over the top reaction to getting

256
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,260
it.

257
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,300
Shortly after this we saw stuff like the Jumpscare Maze game in 2006, or Two Girls One Cup in

258
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,480
2007.

259
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,200
These videos are recordings of normal people watching something designed to get a reaction

260
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
out of them, fear in the first case and disgust in the second.

261
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,280
We're watching these videos not for the Jumpscare Maze or the video of the girls eating

262
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
their own shit.

263
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,080
We're watching these videos to watch how other people react to watching these videos.

264
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,180
React content gives us more information to evaluate than just the original thing.

265
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,440
It shows us how other people react to something, and if our reactions are in line with theirs.

266
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,580
I think this is why Japanese variety TV has had those little reaction portraits of celebrities

267
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,300
watching what's going on for decades now.

268
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,100
There is genuinely something added to the experience, when you're not only enjoying

269
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,860
an event, but watching other people enjoy it too.

270
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,620
Reaction videos hit their initial peak with the Fine Bros back in 2012.

271
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,420
Where they corporatized the model of having seemingly normal people, like kids or teens

272
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,460
or elders, react to the latest viral trend on the internet.

273
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,100
These guys self-destructed when they tried to trademark the react name and the concept

274
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,220
of reaction back in 2016, after other people started uploading their own reactions.

275
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,660
The irony was not lost on the internet.

276
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,980
A couple of guys who made a name for themselves, swiping and reacting to the people's content,

277
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,580
and not really making their own original content, were now mad that others were also

278
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,760
swiping their format and using it for themselves.

279
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,420
Even though they walked it all back, the Fine Bros never really recovered.

280
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,180
Yeah, a few hundred thousand views in a video is pretty nice.

281
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,980
But not for a 20 million sub-channel.

282
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,260
But all of these trends teach us a lot about the nature of react content.

283
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,800
It's enjoyable to watch in a way that just watching original content on its own isn't.

284
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,980
It goes viral easily when it's really good.

285
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,980
It's very easy to make, and it skirts the line on whether or not it's stealing.

286
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,980
A lot of the hatred of the Fine Bros stems from the fact that react content is so simple

287
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,380
to create, and reaps so much in the way of rewards, it feels cheap.

288
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,580
It feels like they're cheating.

289
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:18,380
If you spend hours and hours making a well-done video, and a reactor just grabs it, watches

290
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,740
it, even if they transform it, and then gets way more views than you do off your work,

291
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,180
especially if you don't see a bump for it, it feels really shitty.

292
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,180
It feels like they cheated.

293
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,600
You worked hard and got less.

294
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,500
They worked not so hard and got more.

295
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,900
Intuitively, that just doesn't seem fair.

296
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,640
And I think that's why, from the Fine Bros back in 2012 all the way up to XQC right now,

297
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,540
whenever this topic comes up, people always get mad.

298
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,020
But things like, it feels cheap and it's not fair, isn't really an argument.

299
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,420
We've already determined that if they actually transform the content, then tough titty.

300
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,600
They've made something new and unique, and that's that.

301
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,660
Even if you don't like it.

302
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,760
A lesson that Akilah obviously had to learn the hard way with Sargon.

303
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,340
But the hatred that people like Sniper Wolf get right now, for making nothing but the

304
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,060
most garbage-tier react stuff, is pretty understandable.

305
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,620
She adds nothing but a pretty face to a bunch of TikTok videos.

306
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,560
Yes, I know, I do TikTok Tuesday.

307
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,680
But at least I don't pretend to bait you in with a cute girl.

308
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,180
And plus, I do real content too.

309
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,820
In fact, that actually reminds me of this little exchange from original Game Grumps.

310
00:15:37,180 --> 00:16:02,500
What Jon is pointing out here is that back in 2012, Let's Play is reviewed kinda like

311
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,660
react videos are now.

312
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,380
Low effort content that is potentially wildly popular.

313
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,580
And how demotivating it can be to make more produced, long-form content in the face of

314
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,360
that potential easy success.

315
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,020
I can see both sides of this.

316
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:18,240
Creators being tempted to make the easy content and reap the easy success is understandable.

317
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,420
And many people really are simply just jealous that it's that easy.

318
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,900
But on the other hand, look at what's become of the vast majority of people who have done

319
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,620
that, 10 years on now, who have moved away from their produced content and fell into

320
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,460
doing only Let's Plays or only streams or only reaction videos.

321
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,220
Look at the caliber of person they've transformed into.

322
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,980
What exactly did that initial easy success cost them?

323
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,900
I'm not saying content creators shouldn't do low effort content sometimes, like Let's

324
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,100
Plays or streams or reacts.

325
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,140
I do all those.

326
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,300
But I am saying that for content creators who only do that stuff while abandoning what

327
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,320
initially made them popular, what people actually initially wanted to see out of them, it's

328
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,100
no surprise that people view them as shadows of their former selves.

329
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,240
And it's also no surprise that they often behave like it too.

330
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,780
So here's the final form of the logic tree.

331
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,660
If the streamer gets the consent of the video creator, then playing the video on stream

332
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,660
is fine.

333
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,440
Doesn't matter if they transform it or get a bump from it, none of that is relevant.

334
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,260
Consent trumps all other concerns.

335
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,500
If the streamer doesn't get consent, then if the streamer transforms it enough with

336
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,060
their own labor, it becomes a unique work that the streamer owns themselves and it's

337
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,060
still okay.

338
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,920
If the streamer doesn't get consent and doesn't transform it, then you could argue

339
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,300
that if the creator of the video gets a boost in their career due to the crossover, then

340
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,520
it's still okay.

341
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,780
This is the argument that most streamers use.

342
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,920
And the size of that bump is dependent on many things.

343
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,040
If the streamer credits and links back to the original video, or if the streamer is

344
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,360
immediately reacting to a new video and immediately uploading their stream VOD eating into the

345
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,200
search impressions of the original, there's a whole bunch of factors at play here.

346
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,800
Nonetheless, I don't think this is a good argument, but let's just accept it for hypothetical

347
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
sake.

348
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,000
If the streamer doesn't get consent and doesn't transform it and the original creator

349
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,480
doesn't get a boost, then it just seems like straight up theft.

350
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,080
So what should change about all of this?

351
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,080
Should anything change?

352
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,440
Should there be a common culture among streamers that they should ask video creators before

353
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,440
watching their videos?

354
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,960
Maybe, but that's never going to happen.

355
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,040
Should video creators use the tools at their disposal to claim the revenue of VODs uploaded

356
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
to YouTube?

357
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Sure.

358
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,400
And both Hassan and XQC have gone on record stating that when video creators do this,

359
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
they don't fight them.

360
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
They let them have that revenue.

361
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,840
The issue is, the streamer already got their watch time and their super chats on their

362
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,960
stream, so the VOD's revenue is probably secondary.

363
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Should platforms be enforcing copyright somehow?

364
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,840
I'm not sure about that one, but good luck getting them to do it anyway.

365
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,720
Here's how I personally feel about it.

366
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,840
There should probably be a moratorium when reacting to new videos, since the majority

367
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,640
of hits and revenue that most videos on YouTube earn happen in the first couple of weeks of

368
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
them being uploaded.

369
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,200
Beyond that, streamers should ask for permission if they're just watching and not transforming.

370
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,120
They should also watch any in-video advertisements like sponsorships or announcements.

371
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,380
And they should also link back to the original creator.

372
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,920
There could even be an exception where, for hot new videos, they can actually watch them

373
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,600
immediately but only show the first five minutes or something, and then direct their audience

374
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
to the rest of the video.

375
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,240
But that might be expecting a bit too much.

376
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,720
Ultimately, streamers will do whatever they want.

377
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,480
I don't expect most of them to stop doing this shit, even if YouTubers want them to.

378
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,000
Because most of these streamers aren't actually capable of providing interesting content without

379
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,760
having a YouTube video on in the background.

380
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,540
Have you seen the shit they do otherwise?

381
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,540
Hot tub streams?

382
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,720
Naked body painting?

383
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,880
Fucking sleep streams, dude?

384
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,020
I respect the few gamers left on Twitch.

385
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,020
The longplay channels.

386
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,200
The speedrun channels.

387
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,560
That's at least doing something.

388
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,840
That's still what Twitch was originally, and what it should have remained as.

389
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,280
For me personally, anybody can watch whatever they want on my stuff.

390
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,280
I don't really care.

391
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,280
As long as you credit me.

392
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
I'm cool with it.

393
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
I don't feel that way.

394
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
That's their prerogative.

395
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,080
Nonetheless, streamers aren't going to stop anytime soon, and I don't foresee a path

396
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,380
forward to somehow force them to stop that won't unintentionally wreck a lot of other

397
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,380
things in the attempt.

398
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,800
I also personally believe, though I don't have data to back this up, that the vast majority

399
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,680
of people who have their videos watched by a streamer ultimately gain more than they

400
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,680
lose from it.

401
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,920
Unless it's like a hate watcher or something.

402
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,040
That doesn't excuse violating a YouTuber's consent, but it's better than nothing.

403
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,840
Anyway, the final thing I have to say on this topic is that I think a lot of the viewers

404
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,260
of streamers or YouTubers who are coming in to stake a hard moral claim on this topic

405
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,260
are just virtue signaling.

406
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,260
They don't actually care.

407
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,560
Not the streamers or the YouTubers themselves.

408
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,680
They have their own motivations.

409
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,040
The viewers of them who are going hardcore on this on social media, they're just virtue

410
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
signalers.

411
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,040
Why do I think that?

412
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,780
Well, because when a streamer viewer complains, it's very obvious they're just defending

413
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,220
their parasocial daddy.

414
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,220
They want what they want.

415
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,220
To watch videos on a stream.

416
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,480
The ality and morality be damned.

417
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,100
And when a YouTuber viewer gets up in arms with the lost clicks, and therefore the lost

418
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,100
revenue, and therefore the damage to a YouTuber's bottom line when a streamer reacts to their

419
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,420
video, there's a decent chance that guy's probably running an ad blocker.

420
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,120
And trust me, as somebody with access to my own analytics, ad blockers fuck me over way

421
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,460
more than React streamers ever will.

422
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,100
A lot of this drama just seems to be based on competing self-interest.

423
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,400
YouTubers want people to watch their videos.

424
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,060
Streamers want to watch what they want on their streams.

425
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,140
Viewers tend to side with whoever their guy is.

426
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,060
But ignoring all of that obvious self-interest, it seems to me that the fair thing to do,

427
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,840
such that everyone's interests are somewhat respected, is for streamers to ask for permission

428
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,440
and give proper credit.

429
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,840
Unless they actually transform the content.

430
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Then it becomes theirs.

431
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,860
But since most of them don't, consent and credit.

432
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,460
Two concepts that I don't actually expect progressive Twitch poll streamers to ever

433
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,460
truly understand.
