WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.620
I was on eFAP last week with a whole bunch of other guests to talk about the current

00:09.620 --> 00:11.740
drama surrounding the React meta of Twitch.

00:11.740 --> 00:12.740
I had a really good time.

00:12.740 --> 00:13.740
I love going on eFAP.

00:13.740 --> 00:17.220
But large panels like this aren't always the best way to get a point across.

00:17.220 --> 00:21.260
That, plus I've had a bit of time to think about it, so I want to give a more nuanced

00:21.260 --> 00:22.340
take regarding the topic.

00:22.340 --> 00:26.700
To really understand what's going on, you have to watch like five videos on Destiny's

00:26.700 --> 00:28.780
channel, and they're each several hours long.

00:28.780 --> 00:30.460
And ain't nobody got time for that.

00:30.460 --> 00:32.020
Let me give you a quick TLDR.

00:32.020 --> 00:35.780
xQc and Hassan are two of the most popular streamers in the world.

00:35.780 --> 00:40.380
Hassan is explicitly a socialist, while xQc seems to be more apolitical.

00:40.380 --> 00:45.300
They both got into a lot of controversy last week, when they reacted to Lomino's hour-and-a-half-long

00:45.300 --> 00:47.820
documentary on the assassination of JFK.

00:47.820 --> 00:51.560
Lomino is a YouTuber with over five million subs, and his bread and butter seems to be

00:51.560 --> 00:55.020
highly researched, highly edited long-form videos like this.

00:55.020 --> 00:59.900
xQc and Hassan both got into trouble for playing the entire video on their stream,

00:59.900 --> 01:01.900
though xQc caught a lot more heat.

01:01.900 --> 01:06.300
This sparked multiple debates across multiple channels about the ethics of reacting to other

01:06.300 --> 01:10.100
people's content on stream, on Destiny's stream, on the E5 episode that I was a part

01:10.100 --> 01:15.820
of, ultimately culminating with xQc going on to the H3H3 podcast to debate Ethan Klein

01:15.820 --> 01:16.820
on the topic.

01:16.820 --> 01:17.820
And you know what?

01:17.820 --> 01:20.940
As much as I absolutely fucking hate Ethan Klein, I gotta hand it to him.

01:20.940 --> 01:23.380
He stomped xQc into the dirt.

01:23.380 --> 01:27.020
So when I say minimal commentary, how minimal are we talking here?

01:27.020 --> 01:31.580
Well, xQc's reaction on stream was cut into a video by his editor and uploaded to his

01:31.580 --> 01:32.580
YouTube channel.

01:32.580 --> 01:35.820
That stream segment clocked in at one hour and fifty-three minutes.

01:35.820 --> 01:38.620
Lomino's original video clocks in at an hour thirty-eight.

01:38.620 --> 01:43.500
That means that if we give xQc any sort of time devoted to intro and outro, pre- and

01:43.500 --> 01:48.420
post-discussion of the video, he added fifteen minutes of his own content to Lomino's video.

01:48.420 --> 01:52.860
Is that enough for it to be considered ethical, or is this simply xQc stealing other people's

01:52.860 --> 01:55.200
hard work and letting it run on his stream?

01:55.200 --> 01:56.620
How about Hassan's reaction?

01:56.620 --> 01:58.820
His VOD is two hours and twenty-three minutes.

01:58.820 --> 02:01.920
Good faith assumption that he added forty-five minutes of his own commentary.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.120
Is that enough for it to be considered ethical?

02:04.120 --> 02:07.820
Lots of people look to fair use, which is an American legal argument.

02:07.820 --> 02:11.960
Fair use permits the use of copyrighted material without permission from the owner under specific

02:11.960 --> 02:14.660
circumstances for various artistic purposes.

02:14.660 --> 02:18.880
Current American law has a four-point checklist that can help determine whether or not a use

02:18.880 --> 02:22.380
of a copyrighted work is copyright infringement or is actually fair use.

02:22.380 --> 02:26.620
When determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use,

02:26.620 --> 02:29.260
the factors to be considered shall include 1.

02:29.260 --> 02:33.420
The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature

02:33.420 --> 02:36.140
or is for non-profit educational purposes 2.

02:36.140 --> 02:38.220
The nature of the copyrighted work 3.

02:38.220 --> 02:42.320
The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as

02:42.320 --> 02:43.680
a whole 4.

02:43.680 --> 02:48.240
The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work

02:48.240 --> 02:50.220
Now to be clear, this isn't a hard and fast checklist.

02:50.260 --> 02:53.780
Like, you don't have to tick off the four boxes for a use to be considered fair use.

02:53.780 --> 02:58.000
It's judged on a case-by-case basis, because fair use is what is known as an affirmative

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
defense.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.420
An affirmative defense is, basically, when you don't dispute the facts of the case.

03:02.420 --> 03:04.940
You make the argument that you had a really good reason to do what you did.

03:04.940 --> 03:07.060
Self-defense is a great example of an affirmative defense.

03:07.060 --> 03:10.040
For example, nobody disputes that Rittenhouse shot those people.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.900
His defense is that he had a really good reason to do so, that he was under attack by them

03:12.900 --> 03:14.020
and afraid for his life.

03:14.020 --> 03:16.580
When you claim fair use, it's an affirmative defense.

03:16.580 --> 03:18.860
You're not denying that you're using the copyrighted material.

03:18.860 --> 03:20.980
You're claiming that you have a good reason to use it.

03:20.980 --> 03:25.020
And these four points can help a judge determine whether or not your reason is actually a good

03:25.020 --> 03:26.020
one.

03:26.020 --> 03:28.440
Point one is basically about the social good of the use.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.980
Are you just making a bunch of money ripping off somebody else's work?

03:30.980 --> 03:33.920
Or are you not making any money and instead using it to educate?

03:33.920 --> 03:36.140
Point two is taking into account what you used.

03:36.140 --> 03:39.720
Using a song is different from using a movie, which is different from using a photo.

03:39.720 --> 03:43.740
What the work is will help you determine whether or not your use of it was legitimate.

03:43.740 --> 03:46.660
Point three is taking into account how much of the work you used.

03:46.660 --> 03:49.660
If you're reviewing a movie, you probably shouldn't include the entire movie in your

03:49.660 --> 03:52.900
review and only use the clips necessary to make your points.

03:52.900 --> 03:56.300
But that doesn't mean that under the right circumstances, using a whole work wouldn't

03:56.300 --> 03:57.300
be valid.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.700
It depends on what you're doing with it and if it's necessary.

03:59.700 --> 04:02.680
Point four is taking into account the loss of the copyright holder.

04:02.680 --> 04:06.100
For example, I remember a fan-made project where you tour the Enterprise-D from Star

04:06.100 --> 04:10.540
Trek Next Generation, which Paramount had successfully shut down as they had for sale

04:10.540 --> 04:12.780
their own version doing the exact same thing.

04:12.780 --> 04:17.140
In this case, the impact on the copyright holder is too much for it to be fair use.

04:17.140 --> 04:21.620
The fan was literally providing a competing parallel product for free, depriving Paramount

04:21.620 --> 04:22.620
of sales.

04:22.620 --> 04:25.840
However, it's not as simple as whether or not a copyright holder is financially damaged

04:25.840 --> 04:30.040
by the use, as a negative review of a movie might lead to the creators of the movie seeing

04:30.040 --> 04:31.340
a financial loss.

04:31.340 --> 04:36.220
A review is not a parallel product in the same way as recreating the entire thing.

04:36.220 --> 04:40.820
Basically, fair use isn't a series of hard and fast rules that can be easily figured

04:40.820 --> 04:45.460
out, but a set of guidelines that can help judge a use on a case-by-case basis.

04:45.460 --> 04:49.840
For the UK and Canada and other English-speaking nations, we have fair dealing law instead,

04:49.840 --> 04:51.780
which is mostly similar with a few key differences.

04:51.780 --> 04:52.780
Here we've got a six-point system.

04:52.780 --> 04:55.740
The purpose of the dealing, the character of the dealing, the amount of the dealing,

04:55.740 --> 04:58.980
alternatives to the dealing, the nature of the work used, and the effect of the dealing

04:58.980 --> 04:59.980
on the work.

04:59.980 --> 05:02.660
These mostly cover the same thing as American fair use law.

05:02.660 --> 05:07.580
This is all to say that fair use and fair dealing are legal terms, not moral or ethical

05:07.580 --> 05:08.580
ones.

05:08.580 --> 05:12.420
When people talk about this stuff, they often use these terms colloquially, in a moral sense,

05:12.420 --> 05:13.420
not a legal one.

05:13.420 --> 05:16.060
When something is found to be a fair use, it's considered transformative.

05:16.060 --> 05:21.460
And the conversation surrounding XQC is all about whether or not his reaction was transformative.

05:21.460 --> 05:24.100
Not explicitly in a legal way, but in a colloquial way.

05:24.100 --> 05:27.940
Like are streamers doing anything unethical by just freebooting somebody else's YouTube

05:27.940 --> 05:28.940
videos for their stream?

05:28.940 --> 05:30.820
Let me draw out a logic tree here.

05:30.820 --> 05:33.820
If you're watching me on your second monitor, now is the time to pause Baldur's Gate and

05:33.820 --> 05:34.900
look over for a few minutes.

05:34.900 --> 05:38.740
If Lomino gave the streamers his permission to watch his videos on their stream, then

05:38.740 --> 05:40.060
the conversation is just over.

05:40.060 --> 05:41.060
They got the creators' consent.

05:41.060 --> 05:43.020
I don't think anybody sane would object to this.

05:43.020 --> 05:44.100
What would they even say?

05:44.100 --> 05:47.220
That they still can't watch other people's videos even if the creators said it was okay?

05:47.220 --> 05:50.100
Well, actually, yes, but we'll get back to that in a bit.

05:50.100 --> 05:53.940
If Lomino didn't give them his permission, then the question becomes, did they mix in

05:53.940 --> 05:58.340
enough of their own original content, in a way that their reaction is now transformative?

05:58.340 --> 06:00.140
Again, not legally, colloquially.

06:00.140 --> 06:03.900
In the case of XQC, most people say no, he didn't.

06:03.900 --> 06:08.500
Mahler highlighted on eFAP just how little XQC added during the viewing of his video,

06:08.500 --> 06:12.660
along with pointing out that whenever he paused a comment, his own chat room would revolt,

06:12.660 --> 06:16.300
screaming at him to stop pausing the video and stop adding his own input.

06:16.300 --> 06:21.980
Those people were there less for XQC's reaction and more to just watch a YouTube video uninterrupted

06:21.980 --> 06:23.320
on XQC's stream.

06:23.320 --> 06:27.080
For Hassan's reaction, despite him walking off several times to do other things and just

06:27.080 --> 06:31.300
letting the video play to his chat room in his empty chair, he did actually add his own

06:31.300 --> 06:33.640
commentary significantly more than XQC did.

06:33.640 --> 06:37.760
It was stupid commentary, yes, Hassan is a gibbering retard, but we're not judging

06:37.760 --> 06:41.860
the quality of the commentary this time, we're only judging if they've actually transformed

06:41.860 --> 06:44.160
the original work into a new experience.

06:44.160 --> 06:47.640
And in this case, Hassan has a much stronger claim to that defense than XQC.

06:47.640 --> 06:51.400
So where is that line that makes a use transformative, in the colloquial sense?

06:51.400 --> 06:55.560
I personally think that the various eFAPs on movies and TV shows, as well as my own

06:55.560 --> 06:59.940
watch party videos of the Rings of Power and The Last of Us, those are all transformative.

06:59.940 --> 07:03.320
Because yes, while we are watching the whole show or the whole movie, there's significant

07:03.320 --> 07:07.960
commentary before, during, and after, discussing news articles or social media trends surrounding

07:07.960 --> 07:12.680
the show, bringing up lore inconsistencies or dumb scenes, or whatever else, sitting

07:12.680 --> 07:16.800
there and simply saying true with your mouth full, or letting a video play while you wander

07:16.800 --> 07:19.360
away to jack off in the bathroom, that's not transformative.

07:19.360 --> 07:22.640
I can't tell you where the line is that makes something transformative when you cross

07:22.640 --> 07:23.640
it.

07:23.640 --> 07:26.500
I don't know exactly how much you should add, but I do know that there is an obvious

07:26.500 --> 07:28.140
difference between the two extremes.

07:28.140 --> 07:31.520
If a use isn't transformative, then how unethical is it?

07:31.520 --> 07:32.660
Well, that depends.

07:32.660 --> 07:35.740
This conversation has come up several times now in terms of internet discourse.

07:35.740 --> 07:37.420
The last time it kicked off was a year ago.

07:37.420 --> 07:42.020
Back then I was also on eFAP, talking about Hassan completely stealing one of JX's videos,

07:42.020 --> 07:46.600
just letting it play providing almost no commentary whatsoever, and going over the dumb fuck defense

07:46.600 --> 07:51.220
for this behavior given not only by Hassan himself, but also by A-Relevant and Denims.

07:51.220 --> 07:55.180
And even before that, there was the Twitch TV meta, where large Twitch streamers would

07:55.180 --> 07:59.420
just watch whole ass real TV shows, like the shit that you'd find on cable.

07:59.420 --> 08:03.340
The argument given by these large streamers as to why they should be allowed to do this

08:03.340 --> 08:07.300
makes me think that they view streaming like it's a watch party in Discord, which explains

08:07.300 --> 08:10.760
why xQc's chat was yelling at him every time you paused the video.

08:10.760 --> 08:14.260
These people often say that they should be allowed to do this because the product they're

08:14.260 --> 08:18.600
presenting isn't the movie or the video or the TV show itself, it's the experience

08:18.600 --> 08:21.300
of watching it with other people, with the streamer, with the chat room.

08:21.300 --> 08:24.340
And on some level, we do know that that is a different experience, just like we know

08:24.340 --> 08:26.800
the difference between watching a movie at home versus watching it in the theater.

08:26.800 --> 08:30.360
But the fact that it's a different experience for the viewer, does that make it a transformative

08:30.360 --> 08:31.360
use?

08:31.360 --> 08:32.360
I don't think so.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.160
Another common defense is to compare it to video game streaming.

08:34.160 --> 08:37.880
The argument is that a streamer deprives a video's creator, or a movie's creator,

08:37.880 --> 08:38.880
or a TV show's creator.

08:38.880 --> 08:41.840
Though let's be honest, nobody gives a fuck about Hollywood's welfare right now.

08:41.840 --> 08:46.440
The streamer deprives them revenues or attention or clicks when he plays their content on stream,

08:46.440 --> 08:49.920
even if he reacts to it in a transformative way, let alone just freebooting it.

08:49.920 --> 08:53.200
But since we allow it for video games, we should also allow it for other mediums.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.300
The issue with this argument is that video games have a performative component.

08:56.300 --> 08:59.260
You have to play it, not just passively consume it.

08:59.260 --> 09:01.960
And a streamer's playthrough is necessarily different than yours.

09:01.960 --> 09:05.860
The experience of playing a game cannot be gained through watching somebody else play

09:05.860 --> 09:06.860
it.

09:06.860 --> 09:11.020
But the experience of watching a video or a movie or a TV show can be gained by watching

09:11.020 --> 09:13.540
it with somebody else present, like a streamer or a chat room.

09:13.540 --> 09:17.460
The claim that watching somebody playing a video game is an infringement on the copyright

09:17.460 --> 09:19.420
of the creator of the game doesn't really make sense.

09:19.420 --> 09:23.220
It's like saying watching somebody play baseball is an infringement of the copyright

09:23.220 --> 09:24.220
of the creator of baseball.

09:24.220 --> 09:28.340
The only place where I think this logic has any footing is in games with almost no gameplay

09:28.340 --> 09:29.340
whatsoever.

09:29.340 --> 09:32.460
Like you're just passively moving through the game world applying zero skill and absorbing

09:32.460 --> 09:33.460
a story.

09:33.460 --> 09:35.100
At that point, it might as well just be a TV show.

09:35.100 --> 09:38.140
But for the most part, this logic doesn't work for video game streams.

09:38.140 --> 09:42.140
The final line of defense for this behavior is the effect that streaming somebody's

09:42.140 --> 09:44.300
video has on the creator of the video.

09:44.300 --> 09:47.620
The video creators will often claim that each person who watches it on Hassan's stream

09:47.620 --> 09:51.020
or XQC's stream, that's one less potential view on their video.

09:51.020 --> 09:54.320
Why would they go watch the original on YouTube when they just watch it on a stream?

09:54.320 --> 09:55.660
This was Adam's main argument on Efab.

09:55.660 --> 09:57.380
And I think there's some truth to it.

09:57.380 --> 10:01.800
There obviously will be some people who would have watched the video who just won't now.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.320
That's lost clicks and revenue.

10:03.320 --> 10:06.020
Streamers can mitigate that by shouting out the creator, linking their video, linking

10:06.020 --> 10:07.020
their channel.

10:07.020 --> 10:08.020
But some of them just won't watch it.

10:08.020 --> 10:09.020
Simple as.

10:09.020 --> 10:12.900
But that calculation has to be balanced out by understanding that some people do go back

10:12.900 --> 10:16.860
and watch it, as we regularly see videos get spikes of viewers after a streamer reacts

10:16.860 --> 10:17.860
to it.

10:17.860 --> 10:21.380
If any of those viewers are new viewers, they might sub to the channel, they might watch

10:21.380 --> 10:22.860
future videos on their own.

10:22.860 --> 10:24.740
These effects also have to be taken into account.

10:24.740 --> 10:28.840
There's also the fact that there's generally a significant lack of audience overlap.

10:28.840 --> 10:32.020
Going back to the original example, there's probably not much audience overlap between

10:32.020 --> 10:35.700
Hassan and XQC's stream viewers and Lomino's YouTube viewers.

10:35.700 --> 10:39.380
The chance of those people watching Lomino's content of their own volition is probably

10:39.380 --> 10:40.580
relatively low.

10:40.580 --> 10:43.560
But now that they've seen the JFK video on stream, they just might.

10:43.560 --> 10:47.820
Something we learned during the era of MP3 piracy is that just because somebody downloads

10:47.820 --> 10:50.980
your music, doesn't mean that that's automatically a lost sale.

10:50.980 --> 10:53.340
Some of these people would have just never bought the music at all.

10:53.340 --> 10:55.820
And some of these people would have just never watched Lomino either.

10:55.820 --> 11:00.320
This is the harm conversation, and to me personally, it's the least interesting part of the discussion.

11:00.320 --> 11:04.940
The question here is ultimately, how many views and subs are lost when somebody reacts

11:04.940 --> 11:08.300
to their content on their stream versus how many are gained through exposure to a new

11:08.300 --> 11:09.300
audience.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.100
If you had perfect information, you can just math it out.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.180
If the video creator gains more than they lose, it's not immoral for streamers to

11:14.180 --> 11:15.180
swipe the video.

11:15.180 --> 11:17.380
If the video creator loses more than they gain, it is immoral.

11:17.940 --> 11:20.020
The only issue is that we don't have perfect information, so we're just guessing a lot

11:20.020 --> 11:21.020
of this stuff.

11:21.020 --> 11:23.060
But there's no real moral question here.

11:23.060 --> 11:27.660
Assume that Lomino saw a net material gain from xQc grabbing his video and playing it

11:27.660 --> 11:31.400
while not transforming it, essentially stealing the content to keep his stream entertained.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.300
If Lomino saw a net material loss, it's an easy conversation.

11:34.300 --> 11:35.900
What xQc did was simply unethical.

11:35.900 --> 11:40.220
But if Lomino saw a net material gain, was what xQc did okay?

11:40.220 --> 11:41.220
I'm not so sure.

11:41.220 --> 11:45.500
Because, and sorry progressive consequentialist, you guys are retarded, not all morality is

11:45.500 --> 11:48.500
based on harm reduction and seeking good ends.

11:48.500 --> 11:53.300
Even if Lomino saw a material gain, it's not like he gave xQc his consent to play the

11:53.300 --> 11:54.300
video.

11:54.300 --> 11:57.380
And consent is a moral concept that exists outside of harm.

11:57.380 --> 12:00.300
People can consent to harmful things and refuse non-harmful things.

12:00.300 --> 12:02.940
It's a different type of morality than simple harm reduction.

12:02.940 --> 12:07.820
If Lomino objected to xQc's use of the video, and xQc replied with, aw shut up, you gotta

12:07.820 --> 12:11.980
benefit out of it anyway, and that was actually true, does that mean that xQc is morally in

12:11.980 --> 12:12.980
the clear?

12:12.980 --> 12:15.100
And Lomino has no place to feel put out.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.340
My gut tells me, I don't think so.

12:17.340 --> 12:18.560
So what's at the bottom of this?

12:18.560 --> 12:22.060
To answer that, we gotta go all the way back to the start of React content itself.

12:22.060 --> 12:25.220
The early internet is full of videos where the purpose of them is to see a person's

12:25.220 --> 12:26.220
reaction.

12:26.220 --> 12:27.900
The oldest one I can think of is the N64 kid.

12:27.900 --> 12:32.060
Yeah that was me back when I got my N64 too.

12:32.060 --> 12:35.260
The point of the video isn't the N64, it's the kid's over the top reaction to getting

12:35.260 --> 12:36.260
it.

12:36.260 --> 12:40.300
Shortly after this we saw stuff like the Jumpscare Maze game in 2006, or Two Girls One Cup in

12:40.300 --> 12:41.480
2007.

12:41.480 --> 12:45.200
These videos are recordings of normal people watching something designed to get a reaction

12:45.200 --> 12:47.600
out of them, fear in the first case and disgust in the second.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.280
We're watching these videos not for the Jumpscare Maze or the video of the girls eating

12:51.280 --> 12:52.280
their own shit.

12:52.280 --> 12:56.080
We're watching these videos to watch how other people react to watching these videos.

12:56.080 --> 13:00.180
React content gives us more information to evaluate than just the original thing.

13:00.180 --> 13:04.440
It shows us how other people react to something, and if our reactions are in line with theirs.

13:04.440 --> 13:08.580
I think this is why Japanese variety TV has had those little reaction portraits of celebrities

13:08.580 --> 13:10.300
watching what's going on for decades now.

13:10.300 --> 13:14.100
There is genuinely something added to the experience, when you're not only enjoying

13:14.100 --> 13:16.860
an event, but watching other people enjoy it too.

13:16.860 --> 13:20.620
Reaction videos hit their initial peak with the Fine Bros back in 2012.

13:20.620 --> 13:24.420
Where they corporatized the model of having seemingly normal people, like kids or teens

13:24.420 --> 13:27.460
or elders, react to the latest viral trend on the internet.

13:27.460 --> 13:31.100
These guys self-destructed when they tried to trademark the react name and the concept

13:31.100 --> 13:35.220
of reaction back in 2016, after other people started uploading their own reactions.

13:35.220 --> 13:36.660
The irony was not lost on the internet.

13:36.660 --> 13:39.980
A couple of guys who made a name for themselves, swiping and reacting to the people's content,

13:39.980 --> 13:43.580
and not really making their own original content, were now mad that others were also

13:43.580 --> 13:45.760
swiping their format and using it for themselves.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.420
Even though they walked it all back, the Fine Bros never really recovered.

13:48.420 --> 13:51.180
Yeah, a few hundred thousand views in a video is pretty nice.

13:51.180 --> 13:52.980
But not for a 20 million sub-channel.

13:52.980 --> 13:56.260
But all of these trends teach us a lot about the nature of react content.

13:56.260 --> 13:59.800
It's enjoyable to watch in a way that just watching original content on its own isn't.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.980
It goes viral easily when it's really good.

14:01.980 --> 14:04.980
It's very easy to make, and it skirts the line on whether or not it's stealing.

14:04.980 --> 14:08.980
A lot of the hatred of the Fine Bros stems from the fact that react content is so simple

14:08.980 --> 14:12.380
to create, and reaps so much in the way of rewards, it feels cheap.

14:12.380 --> 14:13.580
It feels like they're cheating.

14:13.580 --> 14:18.380
If you spend hours and hours making a well-done video, and a reactor just grabs it, watches

14:18.380 --> 14:22.740
it, even if they transform it, and then gets way more views than you do off your work,

14:22.740 --> 14:25.180
especially if you don't see a bump for it, it feels really shitty.

14:25.180 --> 14:26.180
It feels like they cheated.

14:26.180 --> 14:27.600
You worked hard and got less.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.500
They worked not so hard and got more.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.900
Intuitively, that just doesn't seem fair.

14:30.900 --> 14:35.640
And I think that's why, from the Fine Bros back in 2012 all the way up to XQC right now,

14:35.640 --> 14:38.540
whenever this topic comes up, people always get mad.

14:38.540 --> 14:42.020
But things like, it feels cheap and it's not fair, isn't really an argument.

14:42.020 --> 14:45.420
We've already determined that if they actually transform the content, then tough titty.

14:45.420 --> 14:47.600
They've made something new and unique, and that's that.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.660
Even if you don't like it.

14:48.660 --> 14:51.760
A lesson that Akilah obviously had to learn the hard way with Sargon.

14:51.760 --> 14:55.340
But the hatred that people like Sniper Wolf get right now, for making nothing but the

14:55.340 --> 14:59.060
most garbage-tier react stuff, is pretty understandable.

14:59.060 --> 15:01.620
She adds nothing but a pretty face to a bunch of TikTok videos.

15:01.620 --> 15:03.560
Yes, I know, I do TikTok Tuesday.

15:03.560 --> 15:05.680
But at least I don't pretend to bait you in with a cute girl.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.180
And plus, I do real content too.

15:07.180 --> 15:10.820
In fact, that actually reminds me of this little exchange from original Game Grumps.

15:37.180 --> 16:02.500
What Jon is pointing out here is that back in 2012, Let's Play is reviewed kinda like

16:02.500 --> 16:03.660
react videos are now.

16:03.660 --> 16:06.380
Low effort content that is potentially wildly popular.

16:06.380 --> 16:10.580
And how demotivating it can be to make more produced, long-form content in the face of

16:10.580 --> 16:12.360
that potential easy success.

16:12.360 --> 16:14.020
I can see both sides of this.

16:14.020 --> 16:18.240
Creators being tempted to make the easy content and reap the easy success is understandable.

16:18.240 --> 16:21.420
And many people really are simply just jealous that it's that easy.

16:21.420 --> 16:24.900
But on the other hand, look at what's become of the vast majority of people who have done

16:24.900 --> 16:28.620
that, 10 years on now, who have moved away from their produced content and fell into

16:28.620 --> 16:32.460
doing only Let's Plays or only streams or only reaction videos.

16:32.460 --> 16:35.220
Look at the caliber of person they've transformed into.

16:35.220 --> 16:37.980
What exactly did that initial easy success cost them?

16:37.980 --> 16:41.900
I'm not saying content creators shouldn't do low effort content sometimes, like Let's

16:41.900 --> 16:43.100
Plays or streams or reacts.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.140
I do all those.

16:44.140 --> 16:48.300
But I am saying that for content creators who only do that stuff while abandoning what

16:48.300 --> 16:52.320
initially made them popular, what people actually initially wanted to see out of them, it's

16:52.320 --> 16:55.100
no surprise that people view them as shadows of their former selves.

16:55.100 --> 16:58.240
And it's also no surprise that they often behave like it too.

16:58.240 --> 17:00.780
So here's the final form of the logic tree.

17:00.780 --> 17:04.660
If the streamer gets the consent of the video creator, then playing the video on stream

17:04.660 --> 17:05.660
is fine.

17:05.660 --> 17:08.440
Doesn't matter if they transform it or get a bump from it, none of that is relevant.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.260
Consent trumps all other concerns.

17:10.260 --> 17:13.500
If the streamer doesn't get consent, then if the streamer transforms it enough with

17:13.500 --> 17:17.060
their own labor, it becomes a unique work that the streamer owns themselves and it's

17:17.060 --> 17:18.060
still okay.

17:18.060 --> 17:21.920
If the streamer doesn't get consent and doesn't transform it, then you could argue

17:21.920 --> 17:25.300
that if the creator of the video gets a boost in their career due to the crossover, then

17:25.300 --> 17:26.520
it's still okay.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.780
This is the argument that most streamers use.

17:28.780 --> 17:30.920
And the size of that bump is dependent on many things.

17:30.920 --> 17:34.040
If the streamer credits and links back to the original video, or if the streamer is

17:34.040 --> 17:38.360
immediately reacting to a new video and immediately uploading their stream VOD eating into the

17:38.360 --> 17:41.200
search impressions of the original, there's a whole bunch of factors at play here.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.800
Nonetheless, I don't think this is a good argument, but let's just accept it for hypothetical

17:44.800 --> 17:45.800
sake.

17:45.800 --> 17:49.000
If the streamer doesn't get consent and doesn't transform it and the original creator

17:49.000 --> 17:51.480
doesn't get a boost, then it just seems like straight up theft.

17:51.480 --> 17:54.080
So what should change about all of this?

17:54.080 --> 17:55.080
Should anything change?

17:55.080 --> 17:58.440
Should there be a common culture among streamers that they should ask video creators before

17:58.440 --> 17:59.440
watching their videos?

17:59.440 --> 18:00.960
Maybe, but that's never going to happen.

18:00.960 --> 18:05.040
Should video creators use the tools at their disposal to claim the revenue of VODs uploaded

18:05.040 --> 18:06.040
to YouTube?

18:06.040 --> 18:07.040
Sure.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.400
And both Hassan and XQC have gone on record stating that when video creators do this,

18:09.400 --> 18:10.400
they don't fight them.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.400
They let them have that revenue.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.840
The issue is, the streamer already got their watch time and their super chats on their

18:14.840 --> 18:16.960
stream, so the VOD's revenue is probably secondary.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.960
Should platforms be enforcing copyright somehow?

18:18.960 --> 18:21.840
I'm not sure about that one, but good luck getting them to do it anyway.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.720
Here's how I personally feel about it.

18:23.720 --> 18:26.840
There should probably be a moratorium when reacting to new videos, since the majority

18:26.840 --> 18:30.640
of hits and revenue that most videos on YouTube earn happen in the first couple of weeks of

18:30.640 --> 18:31.640
them being uploaded.

18:31.640 --> 18:36.200
Beyond that, streamers should ask for permission if they're just watching and not transforming.

18:36.200 --> 18:41.120
They should also watch any in-video advertisements like sponsorships or announcements.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.380
And they should also link back to the original creator.

18:43.380 --> 18:46.920
There could even be an exception where, for hot new videos, they can actually watch them

18:46.920 --> 18:50.600
immediately but only show the first five minutes or something, and then direct their audience

18:50.600 --> 18:51.600
to the rest of the video.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.240
But that might be expecting a bit too much.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.720
Ultimately, streamers will do whatever they want.

18:54.800 --> 18:58.480
I don't expect most of them to stop doing this shit, even if YouTubers want them to.

18:58.480 --> 19:02.000
Because most of these streamers aren't actually capable of providing interesting content without

19:02.000 --> 19:03.760
having a YouTube video on in the background.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.540
Have you seen the shit they do otherwise?

19:05.540 --> 19:06.540
Hot tub streams?

19:06.540 --> 19:07.720
Naked body painting?

19:07.720 --> 19:08.880
Fucking sleep streams, dude?

19:08.880 --> 19:11.020
I respect the few gamers left on Twitch.

19:11.020 --> 19:12.020
The longplay channels.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.200
The speedrun channels.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.560
That's at least doing something.

19:14.560 --> 19:17.840
That's still what Twitch was originally, and what it should have remained as.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.280
For me personally, anybody can watch whatever they want on my stuff.

19:20.280 --> 19:21.280
I don't really care.

19:21.280 --> 19:22.280
As long as you credit me.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.280
I'm cool with it.

19:23.280 --> 19:24.280
I don't feel that way.

19:24.280 --> 19:25.280
That's their prerogative.

19:25.280 --> 19:28.080
Nonetheless, streamers aren't going to stop anytime soon, and I don't foresee a path

19:28.080 --> 19:31.380
forward to somehow force them to stop that won't unintentionally wreck a lot of other

19:31.380 --> 19:32.380
things in the attempt.

19:32.380 --> 19:35.800
I also personally believe, though I don't have data to back this up, that the vast majority

19:35.800 --> 19:39.680
of people who have their videos watched by a streamer ultimately gain more than they

19:39.680 --> 19:40.680
lose from it.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.920
Unless it's like a hate watcher or something.

19:41.920 --> 19:45.040
That doesn't excuse violating a YouTuber's consent, but it's better than nothing.

19:45.040 --> 19:48.840
Anyway, the final thing I have to say on this topic is that I think a lot of the viewers

19:48.840 --> 19:53.260
of streamers or YouTubers who are coming in to stake a hard moral claim on this topic

19:53.260 --> 19:54.260
are just virtue signaling.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.260
They don't actually care.

19:55.260 --> 19:56.560
Not the streamers or the YouTubers themselves.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.680
They have their own motivations.

19:57.680 --> 20:01.040
The viewers of them who are going hardcore on this on social media, they're just virtue

20:01.040 --> 20:02.040
signalers.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.040
Why do I think that?

20:03.040 --> 20:05.780
Well, because when a streamer viewer complains, it's very obvious they're just defending

20:05.780 --> 20:07.220
their parasocial daddy.

20:07.220 --> 20:08.220
They want what they want.

20:08.220 --> 20:09.220
To watch videos on a stream.

20:09.220 --> 20:10.480
The ality and morality be damned.

20:10.480 --> 20:14.100
And when a YouTuber viewer gets up in arms with the lost clicks, and therefore the lost

20:14.100 --> 20:18.100
revenue, and therefore the damage to a YouTuber's bottom line when a streamer reacts to their

20:18.100 --> 20:21.420
video, there's a decent chance that guy's probably running an ad blocker.

20:21.420 --> 20:25.120
And trust me, as somebody with access to my own analytics, ad blockers fuck me over way

20:25.120 --> 20:27.460
more than React streamers ever will.

20:27.460 --> 20:32.100
A lot of this drama just seems to be based on competing self-interest.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.400
YouTubers want people to watch their videos.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.060
Streamers want to watch what they want on their streams.

20:37.060 --> 20:39.140
Viewers tend to side with whoever their guy is.

20:39.140 --> 20:44.060
But ignoring all of that obvious self-interest, it seems to me that the fair thing to do,

20:44.060 --> 20:48.840
such that everyone's interests are somewhat respected, is for streamers to ask for permission

20:48.840 --> 20:50.440
and give proper credit.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.840
Unless they actually transform the content.

20:52.840 --> 20:53.840
Then it becomes theirs.

20:53.840 --> 20:56.860
But since most of them don't, consent and credit.

20:56.860 --> 21:00.460
Two concepts that I don't actually expect progressive Twitch poll streamers to ever

21:00.460 --> 21:01.460
truly understand.
