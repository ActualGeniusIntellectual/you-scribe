0	9620	I was on eFAP last week with a whole bunch of other guests to talk about the current
9620	11740	drama surrounding the React meta of Twitch.
11740	12740	I had a really good time.
12740	13740	I love going on eFAP.
13740	17220	But large panels like this aren't always the best way to get a point across.
17220	21260	That, plus I've had a bit of time to think about it, so I want to give a more nuanced
21260	22340	take regarding the topic.
22340	26700	To really understand what's going on, you have to watch like five videos on Destiny's
26700	28780	channel, and they're each several hours long.
28780	30460	And ain't nobody got time for that.
30460	32020	Let me give you a quick TLDR.
32020	35780	xQc and Hassan are two of the most popular streamers in the world.
35780	40380	Hassan is explicitly a socialist, while xQc seems to be more apolitical.
40380	45300	They both got into a lot of controversy last week, when they reacted to Lomino's hour-and-a-half-long
45300	47820	documentary on the assassination of JFK.
47820	51560	Lomino is a YouTuber with over five million subs, and his bread and butter seems to be
51560	55020	highly researched, highly edited long-form videos like this.
55020	59900	xQc and Hassan both got into trouble for playing the entire video on their stream,
59900	61900	though xQc caught a lot more heat.
61900	66300	This sparked multiple debates across multiple channels about the ethics of reacting to other
66300	70100	people's content on stream, on Destiny's stream, on the E5 episode that I was a part
70100	75820	of, ultimately culminating with xQc going on to the H3H3 podcast to debate Ethan Klein
75820	76820	on the topic.
76820	77820	And you know what?
77820	80940	As much as I absolutely fucking hate Ethan Klein, I gotta hand it to him.
80940	83380	He stomped xQc into the dirt.
83380	87020	So when I say minimal commentary, how minimal are we talking here?
87020	91580	Well, xQc's reaction on stream was cut into a video by his editor and uploaded to his
91580	92580	YouTube channel.
92580	95820	That stream segment clocked in at one hour and fifty-three minutes.
95820	98620	Lomino's original video clocks in at an hour thirty-eight.
98620	103500	That means that if we give xQc any sort of time devoted to intro and outro, pre- and
103500	108420	post-discussion of the video, he added fifteen minutes of his own content to Lomino's video.
108420	112860	Is that enough for it to be considered ethical, or is this simply xQc stealing other people's
112860	115200	hard work and letting it run on his stream?
115200	116620	How about Hassan's reaction?
116620	118820	His VOD is two hours and twenty-three minutes.
118820	121920	Good faith assumption that he added forty-five minutes of his own commentary.
121920	124120	Is that enough for it to be considered ethical?
124120	127820	Lots of people look to fair use, which is an American legal argument.
127820	131960	Fair use permits the use of copyrighted material without permission from the owner under specific
131960	134660	circumstances for various artistic purposes.
134660	138880	Current American law has a four-point checklist that can help determine whether or not a use
138880	142380	of a copyrighted work is copyright infringement or is actually fair use.
142380	146620	When determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use,
146620	149260	the factors to be considered shall include 1.
149260	153420	The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature
153420	156140	or is for non-profit educational purposes 2.
156140	158220	The nature of the copyrighted work 3.
158220	162320	The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as
162320	163680	a whole 4.
163680	168240	The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work
168240	170220	Now to be clear, this isn't a hard and fast checklist.
170260	173780	Like, you don't have to tick off the four boxes for a use to be considered fair use.
173780	178000	It's judged on a case-by-case basis, because fair use is what is known as an affirmative
178000	179000	defense.
179000	182420	An affirmative defense is, basically, when you don't dispute the facts of the case.
182420	184940	You make the argument that you had a really good reason to do what you did.
184940	187060	Self-defense is a great example of an affirmative defense.
187060	190040	For example, nobody disputes that Rittenhouse shot those people.
190040	192900	His defense is that he had a really good reason to do so, that he was under attack by them
192900	194020	and afraid for his life.
194020	196580	When you claim fair use, it's an affirmative defense.
196580	198860	You're not denying that you're using the copyrighted material.
198860	200980	You're claiming that you have a good reason to use it.
200980	205020	And these four points can help a judge determine whether or not your reason is actually a good
205020	206020	one.
206020	208440	Point one is basically about the social good of the use.
208440	210980	Are you just making a bunch of money ripping off somebody else's work?
210980	213920	Or are you not making any money and instead using it to educate?
213920	216140	Point two is taking into account what you used.
216140	219720	Using a song is different from using a movie, which is different from using a photo.
219720	223740	What the work is will help you determine whether or not your use of it was legitimate.
223740	226660	Point three is taking into account how much of the work you used.
226660	229660	If you're reviewing a movie, you probably shouldn't include the entire movie in your
229660	232900	review and only use the clips necessary to make your points.
232900	236300	But that doesn't mean that under the right circumstances, using a whole work wouldn't
236300	237300	be valid.
237300	239700	It depends on what you're doing with it and if it's necessary.
239700	242680	Point four is taking into account the loss of the copyright holder.
242680	246100	For example, I remember a fan-made project where you tour the Enterprise-D from Star
246100	250540	Trek Next Generation, which Paramount had successfully shut down as they had for sale
250540	252780	their own version doing the exact same thing.
252780	257140	In this case, the impact on the copyright holder is too much for it to be fair use.
257140	261620	The fan was literally providing a competing parallel product for free, depriving Paramount
261620	262620	of sales.
262620	265840	However, it's not as simple as whether or not a copyright holder is financially damaged
265840	270040	by the use, as a negative review of a movie might lead to the creators of the movie seeing
270040	271340	a financial loss.
271340	276220	A review is not a parallel product in the same way as recreating the entire thing.
276220	280820	Basically, fair use isn't a series of hard and fast rules that can be easily figured
280820	285460	out, but a set of guidelines that can help judge a use on a case-by-case basis.
285460	289840	For the UK and Canada and other English-speaking nations, we have fair dealing law instead,
289840	291780	which is mostly similar with a few key differences.
291780	292780	Here we've got a six-point system.
292780	295740	The purpose of the dealing, the character of the dealing, the amount of the dealing,
295740	298980	alternatives to the dealing, the nature of the work used, and the effect of the dealing
298980	299980	on the work.
299980	302660	These mostly cover the same thing as American fair use law.
302660	307580	This is all to say that fair use and fair dealing are legal terms, not moral or ethical
307580	308580	ones.
308580	312420	When people talk about this stuff, they often use these terms colloquially, in a moral sense,
312420	313420	not a legal one.
313420	316060	When something is found to be a fair use, it's considered transformative.
316060	321460	And the conversation surrounding XQC is all about whether or not his reaction was transformative.
321460	324100	Not explicitly in a legal way, but in a colloquial way.
324100	327940	Like are streamers doing anything unethical by just freebooting somebody else's YouTube
327940	328940	videos for their stream?
328940	330820	Let me draw out a logic tree here.
330820	333820	If you're watching me on your second monitor, now is the time to pause Baldur's Gate and
333820	334900	look over for a few minutes.
334900	338740	If Lomino gave the streamers his permission to watch his videos on their stream, then
338740	340060	the conversation is just over.
340060	341060	They got the creators' consent.
341060	343020	I don't think anybody sane would object to this.
343020	344100	What would they even say?
344100	347220	That they still can't watch other people's videos even if the creators said it was okay?
347220	350100	Well, actually, yes, but we'll get back to that in a bit.
350100	353940	If Lomino didn't give them his permission, then the question becomes, did they mix in
353940	358340	enough of their own original content, in a way that their reaction is now transformative?
358340	360140	Again, not legally, colloquially.
360140	363900	In the case of XQC, most people say no, he didn't.
363900	368500	Mahler highlighted on eFAP just how little XQC added during the viewing of his video,
368500	372660	along with pointing out that whenever he paused a comment, his own chat room would revolt,
372660	376300	screaming at him to stop pausing the video and stop adding his own input.
376300	381980	Those people were there less for XQC's reaction and more to just watch a YouTube video uninterrupted
381980	383320	on XQC's stream.
383320	387080	For Hassan's reaction, despite him walking off several times to do other things and just
387080	391300	letting the video play to his chat room in his empty chair, he did actually add his own
391300	393640	commentary significantly more than XQC did.
393640	397760	It was stupid commentary, yes, Hassan is a gibbering retard, but we're not judging
397760	401860	the quality of the commentary this time, we're only judging if they've actually transformed
401860	404160	the original work into a new experience.
404160	407640	And in this case, Hassan has a much stronger claim to that defense than XQC.
407640	411400	So where is that line that makes a use transformative, in the colloquial sense?
411400	415560	I personally think that the various eFAPs on movies and TV shows, as well as my own
415560	419940	watch party videos of the Rings of Power and The Last of Us, those are all transformative.
419940	423320	Because yes, while we are watching the whole show or the whole movie, there's significant
423320	427960	commentary before, during, and after, discussing news articles or social media trends surrounding
427960	432680	the show, bringing up lore inconsistencies or dumb scenes, or whatever else, sitting
432680	436800	there and simply saying true with your mouth full, or letting a video play while you wander
436800	439360	away to jack off in the bathroom, that's not transformative.
439360	442640	I can't tell you where the line is that makes something transformative when you cross
442640	443640	it.
443640	446500	I don't know exactly how much you should add, but I do know that there is an obvious
446500	448140	difference between the two extremes.
448140	451520	If a use isn't transformative, then how unethical is it?
451520	452660	Well, that depends.
452660	455740	This conversation has come up several times now in terms of internet discourse.
455740	457420	The last time it kicked off was a year ago.
457420	462020	Back then I was also on eFAP, talking about Hassan completely stealing one of JX's videos,
462020	466600	just letting it play providing almost no commentary whatsoever, and going over the dumb fuck defense
466600	471220	for this behavior given not only by Hassan himself, but also by A-Relevant and Denims.
471220	475180	And even before that, there was the Twitch TV meta, where large Twitch streamers would
475180	479420	just watch whole ass real TV shows, like the shit that you'd find on cable.
479420	483340	The argument given by these large streamers as to why they should be allowed to do this
483340	487300	makes me think that they view streaming like it's a watch party in Discord, which explains
487300	490760	why xQc's chat was yelling at him every time you paused the video.
490760	494260	These people often say that they should be allowed to do this because the product they're
494260	498600	presenting isn't the movie or the video or the TV show itself, it's the experience
498600	501300	of watching it with other people, with the streamer, with the chat room.
501300	504340	And on some level, we do know that that is a different experience, just like we know
504340	506800	the difference between watching a movie at home versus watching it in the theater.
506800	510360	But the fact that it's a different experience for the viewer, does that make it a transformative
510360	511360	use?
511360	512360	I don't think so.
512360	514160	Another common defense is to compare it to video game streaming.
514160	517880	The argument is that a streamer deprives a video's creator, or a movie's creator,
517880	518880	or a TV show's creator.
518880	521840	Though let's be honest, nobody gives a fuck about Hollywood's welfare right now.
521840	526440	The streamer deprives them revenues or attention or clicks when he plays their content on stream,
526440	529920	even if he reacts to it in a transformative way, let alone just freebooting it.
529920	533200	But since we allow it for video games, we should also allow it for other mediums.
533200	536300	The issue with this argument is that video games have a performative component.
536300	539260	You have to play it, not just passively consume it.
539260	541960	And a streamer's playthrough is necessarily different than yours.
541960	545860	The experience of playing a game cannot be gained through watching somebody else play
545860	546860	it.
546860	551020	But the experience of watching a video or a movie or a TV show can be gained by watching
551020	553540	it with somebody else present, like a streamer or a chat room.
553540	557460	The claim that watching somebody playing a video game is an infringement on the copyright
557460	559420	of the creator of the game doesn't really make sense.
559420	563220	It's like saying watching somebody play baseball is an infringement of the copyright
563220	564220	of the creator of baseball.
564220	568340	The only place where I think this logic has any footing is in games with almost no gameplay
568340	569340	whatsoever.
569340	572460	Like you're just passively moving through the game world applying zero skill and absorbing
572460	573460	a story.
573460	575100	At that point, it might as well just be a TV show.
575100	578140	But for the most part, this logic doesn't work for video game streams.
578140	582140	The final line of defense for this behavior is the effect that streaming somebody's
582140	584300	video has on the creator of the video.
584300	587620	The video creators will often claim that each person who watches it on Hassan's stream
587620	591020	or XQC's stream, that's one less potential view on their video.
591020	594320	Why would they go watch the original on YouTube when they just watch it on a stream?
594320	595660	This was Adam's main argument on Efab.
595660	597380	And I think there's some truth to it.
597380	601800	There obviously will be some people who would have watched the video who just won't now.
601800	603320	That's lost clicks and revenue.
603320	606020	Streamers can mitigate that by shouting out the creator, linking their video, linking
606020	607020	their channel.
607020	608020	But some of them just won't watch it.
608020	609020	Simple as.
609020	612900	But that calculation has to be balanced out by understanding that some people do go back
612900	616860	and watch it, as we regularly see videos get spikes of viewers after a streamer reacts
616860	617860	to it.
617860	621380	If any of those viewers are new viewers, they might sub to the channel, they might watch
621380	622860	future videos on their own.
622860	624740	These effects also have to be taken into account.
624740	628840	There's also the fact that there's generally a significant lack of audience overlap.
628840	632020	Going back to the original example, there's probably not much audience overlap between
632020	635700	Hassan and XQC's stream viewers and Lomino's YouTube viewers.
635700	639380	The chance of those people watching Lomino's content of their own volition is probably
639380	640580	relatively low.
640580	643560	But now that they've seen the JFK video on stream, they just might.
643560	647820	Something we learned during the era of MP3 piracy is that just because somebody downloads
647820	650980	your music, doesn't mean that that's automatically a lost sale.
650980	653340	Some of these people would have just never bought the music at all.
653340	655820	And some of these people would have just never watched Lomino either.
655820	660320	This is the harm conversation, and to me personally, it's the least interesting part of the discussion.
660320	664940	The question here is ultimately, how many views and subs are lost when somebody reacts
664940	668300	to their content on their stream versus how many are gained through exposure to a new
668300	669300	audience.
669300	671100	If you had perfect information, you can just math it out.
671100	674180	If the video creator gains more than they lose, it's not immoral for streamers to
674180	675180	swipe the video.
675180	677380	If the video creator loses more than they gain, it is immoral.
677940	680020	The only issue is that we don't have perfect information, so we're just guessing a lot
680020	681020	of this stuff.
681020	683060	But there's no real moral question here.
683060	687660	Assume that Lomino saw a net material gain from xQc grabbing his video and playing it
687660	691400	while not transforming it, essentially stealing the content to keep his stream entertained.
691400	694300	If Lomino saw a net material loss, it's an easy conversation.
694300	695900	What xQc did was simply unethical.
695900	700220	But if Lomino saw a net material gain, was what xQc did okay?
700220	701220	I'm not so sure.
701220	705500	Because, and sorry progressive consequentialist, you guys are retarded, not all morality is
705500	708500	based on harm reduction and seeking good ends.
708500	713300	Even if Lomino saw a material gain, it's not like he gave xQc his consent to play the
713300	714300	video.
714300	717380	And consent is a moral concept that exists outside of harm.
717380	720300	People can consent to harmful things and refuse non-harmful things.
720300	722940	It's a different type of morality than simple harm reduction.
722940	727820	If Lomino objected to xQc's use of the video, and xQc replied with, aw shut up, you gotta
727820	731980	benefit out of it anyway, and that was actually true, does that mean that xQc is morally in
731980	732980	the clear?
732980	735100	And Lomino has no place to feel put out.
735100	737340	My gut tells me, I don't think so.
737340	738560	So what's at the bottom of this?
738560	742060	To answer that, we gotta go all the way back to the start of React content itself.
742060	745220	The early internet is full of videos where the purpose of them is to see a person's
745220	746220	reaction.
746220	747900	The oldest one I can think of is the N64 kid.
747900	752060	Yeah that was me back when I got my N64 too.
752060	755260	The point of the video isn't the N64, it's the kid's over the top reaction to getting
755260	756260	it.
756260	760300	Shortly after this we saw stuff like the Jumpscare Maze game in 2006, or Two Girls One Cup in
760300	761480	2007.
761480	765200	These videos are recordings of normal people watching something designed to get a reaction
765200	767600	out of them, fear in the first case and disgust in the second.
767600	771280	We're watching these videos not for the Jumpscare Maze or the video of the girls eating
771280	772280	their own shit.
772280	776080	We're watching these videos to watch how other people react to watching these videos.
776080	780180	React content gives us more information to evaluate than just the original thing.
780180	784440	It shows us how other people react to something, and if our reactions are in line with theirs.
784440	788580	I think this is why Japanese variety TV has had those little reaction portraits of celebrities
788580	790300	watching what's going on for decades now.
790300	794100	There is genuinely something added to the experience, when you're not only enjoying
794100	796860	an event, but watching other people enjoy it too.
796860	800620	Reaction videos hit their initial peak with the Fine Bros back in 2012.
800620	804420	Where they corporatized the model of having seemingly normal people, like kids or teens
804420	807460	or elders, react to the latest viral trend on the internet.
807460	811100	These guys self-destructed when they tried to trademark the react name and the concept
811100	815220	of reaction back in 2016, after other people started uploading their own reactions.
815220	816660	The irony was not lost on the internet.
816660	819980	A couple of guys who made a name for themselves, swiping and reacting to the people's content,
819980	823580	and not really making their own original content, were now mad that others were also
823580	825760	swiping their format and using it for themselves.
825760	828420	Even though they walked it all back, the Fine Bros never really recovered.
828420	831180	Yeah, a few hundred thousand views in a video is pretty nice.
831180	832980	But not for a 20 million sub-channel.
832980	836260	But all of these trends teach us a lot about the nature of react content.
836260	839800	It's enjoyable to watch in a way that just watching original content on its own isn't.
839800	841980	It goes viral easily when it's really good.
841980	844980	It's very easy to make, and it skirts the line on whether or not it's stealing.
844980	848980	A lot of the hatred of the Fine Bros stems from the fact that react content is so simple
848980	852380	to create, and reaps so much in the way of rewards, it feels cheap.
852380	853580	It feels like they're cheating.
853580	858380	If you spend hours and hours making a well-done video, and a reactor just grabs it, watches
858380	862740	it, even if they transform it, and then gets way more views than you do off your work,
862740	865180	especially if you don't see a bump for it, it feels really shitty.
865180	866180	It feels like they cheated.
866180	867600	You worked hard and got less.
867600	869500	They worked not so hard and got more.
869500	870900	Intuitively, that just doesn't seem fair.
870900	875640	And I think that's why, from the Fine Bros back in 2012 all the way up to XQC right now,
875640	878540	whenever this topic comes up, people always get mad.
878540	882020	But things like, it feels cheap and it's not fair, isn't really an argument.
882020	885420	We've already determined that if they actually transform the content, then tough titty.
885420	887600	They've made something new and unique, and that's that.
887600	888660	Even if you don't like it.
888660	891760	A lesson that Akilah obviously had to learn the hard way with Sargon.
891760	895340	But the hatred that people like Sniper Wolf get right now, for making nothing but the
895340	899060	most garbage-tier react stuff, is pretty understandable.
899060	901620	She adds nothing but a pretty face to a bunch of TikTok videos.
901620	903560	Yes, I know, I do TikTok Tuesday.
903560	905680	But at least I don't pretend to bait you in with a cute girl.
905680	907180	And plus, I do real content too.
907180	910820	In fact, that actually reminds me of this little exchange from original Game Grumps.
937180	962500	What Jon is pointing out here is that back in 2012, Let's Play is reviewed kinda like
962500	963660	react videos are now.
963660	966380	Low effort content that is potentially wildly popular.
966380	970580	And how demotivating it can be to make more produced, long-form content in the face of
970580	972360	that potential easy success.
972360	974020	I can see both sides of this.
974020	978240	Creators being tempted to make the easy content and reap the easy success is understandable.
978240	981420	And many people really are simply just jealous that it's that easy.
981420	984900	But on the other hand, look at what's become of the vast majority of people who have done
984900	988620	that, 10 years on now, who have moved away from their produced content and fell into
988620	992460	doing only Let's Plays or only streams or only reaction videos.
992460	995220	Look at the caliber of person they've transformed into.
995220	997980	What exactly did that initial easy success cost them?
997980	1001900	I'm not saying content creators shouldn't do low effort content sometimes, like Let's
1001900	1003100	Plays or streams or reacts.
1003100	1004140	I do all those.
1004140	1008300	But I am saying that for content creators who only do that stuff while abandoning what
1008300	1012320	initially made them popular, what people actually initially wanted to see out of them, it's
1012320	1015100	no surprise that people view them as shadows of their former selves.
1015100	1018240	And it's also no surprise that they often behave like it too.
1018240	1020780	So here's the final form of the logic tree.
1020780	1024660	If the streamer gets the consent of the video creator, then playing the video on stream
1024660	1025660	is fine.
1025660	1028440	Doesn't matter if they transform it or get a bump from it, none of that is relevant.
1028440	1030260	Consent trumps all other concerns.
1030260	1033500	If the streamer doesn't get consent, then if the streamer transforms it enough with
1033500	1037060	their own labor, it becomes a unique work that the streamer owns themselves and it's
1037060	1038060	still okay.
1038060	1041920	If the streamer doesn't get consent and doesn't transform it, then you could argue
1041920	1045300	that if the creator of the video gets a boost in their career due to the crossover, then
1045300	1046520	it's still okay.
1046520	1048780	This is the argument that most streamers use.
1048780	1050920	And the size of that bump is dependent on many things.
1050920	1054040	If the streamer credits and links back to the original video, or if the streamer is
1054040	1058360	immediately reacting to a new video and immediately uploading their stream VOD eating into the
1058360	1061200	search impressions of the original, there's a whole bunch of factors at play here.
1061200	1064800	Nonetheless, I don't think this is a good argument, but let's just accept it for hypothetical
1064800	1065800	sake.
1065800	1069000	If the streamer doesn't get consent and doesn't transform it and the original creator
1069000	1071480	doesn't get a boost, then it just seems like straight up theft.
1071480	1074080	So what should change about all of this?
1074080	1075080	Should anything change?
1075080	1078440	Should there be a common culture among streamers that they should ask video creators before
1078440	1079440	watching their videos?
1079440	1080960	Maybe, but that's never going to happen.
1080960	1085040	Should video creators use the tools at their disposal to claim the revenue of VODs uploaded
1085040	1086040	to YouTube?
1086040	1087040	Sure.
1087040	1089400	And both Hassan and XQC have gone on record stating that when video creators do this,
1089400	1090400	they don't fight them.
1090400	1091400	They let them have that revenue.
1091400	1094840	The issue is, the streamer already got their watch time and their super chats on their
1094840	1096960	stream, so the VOD's revenue is probably secondary.
1096960	1098960	Should platforms be enforcing copyright somehow?
1098960	1101840	I'm not sure about that one, but good luck getting them to do it anyway.
1101840	1103720	Here's how I personally feel about it.
1103720	1106840	There should probably be a moratorium when reacting to new videos, since the majority
1106840	1110640	of hits and revenue that most videos on YouTube earn happen in the first couple of weeks of
1110640	1111640	them being uploaded.
1111640	1116200	Beyond that, streamers should ask for permission if they're just watching and not transforming.
1116200	1121120	They should also watch any in-video advertisements like sponsorships or announcements.
1121120	1123380	And they should also link back to the original creator.
1123380	1126920	There could even be an exception where, for hot new videos, they can actually watch them
1126920	1130600	immediately but only show the first five minutes or something, and then direct their audience
1130600	1131600	to the rest of the video.
1131600	1133240	But that might be expecting a bit too much.
1133240	1134720	Ultimately, streamers will do whatever they want.
1134800	1138480	I don't expect most of them to stop doing this shit, even if YouTubers want them to.
1138480	1142000	Because most of these streamers aren't actually capable of providing interesting content without
1142000	1143760	having a YouTube video on in the background.
1143760	1145540	Have you seen the shit they do otherwise?
1145540	1146540	Hot tub streams?
1146540	1147720	Naked body painting?
1147720	1148880	Fucking sleep streams, dude?
1148880	1151020	I respect the few gamers left on Twitch.
1151020	1152020	The longplay channels.
1152020	1153200	The speedrun channels.
1153200	1154560	That's at least doing something.
1154560	1157840	That's still what Twitch was originally, and what it should have remained as.
1157840	1160280	For me personally, anybody can watch whatever they want on my stuff.
1160280	1161280	I don't really care.
1161280	1162280	As long as you credit me.
1162280	1163280	I'm cool with it.
1163280	1164280	I don't feel that way.
1164280	1165280	That's their prerogative.
1165280	1168080	Nonetheless, streamers aren't going to stop anytime soon, and I don't foresee a path
1168080	1171380	forward to somehow force them to stop that won't unintentionally wreck a lot of other
1171380	1172380	things in the attempt.
1172380	1175800	I also personally believe, though I don't have data to back this up, that the vast majority
1175800	1179680	of people who have their videos watched by a streamer ultimately gain more than they
1179680	1180680	lose from it.
1180680	1181920	Unless it's like a hate watcher or something.
1181920	1185040	That doesn't excuse violating a YouTuber's consent, but it's better than nothing.
1185040	1188840	Anyway, the final thing I have to say on this topic is that I think a lot of the viewers
1188840	1193260	of streamers or YouTubers who are coming in to stake a hard moral claim on this topic
1193260	1194260	are just virtue signaling.
1194260	1195260	They don't actually care.
1195260	1196560	Not the streamers or the YouTubers themselves.
1196560	1197680	They have their own motivations.
1197680	1201040	The viewers of them who are going hardcore on this on social media, they're just virtue
1201040	1202040	signalers.
1202040	1203040	Why do I think that?
1203040	1205780	Well, because when a streamer viewer complains, it's very obvious they're just defending
1205780	1207220	their parasocial daddy.
1207220	1208220	They want what they want.
1208220	1209220	To watch videos on a stream.
1209220	1210480	The ality and morality be damned.
1210480	1214100	And when a YouTuber viewer gets up in arms with the lost clicks, and therefore the lost
1214100	1218100	revenue, and therefore the damage to a YouTuber's bottom line when a streamer reacts to their
1218100	1221420	video, there's a decent chance that guy's probably running an ad blocker.
1221420	1225120	And trust me, as somebody with access to my own analytics, ad blockers fuck me over way
1225120	1227460	more than React streamers ever will.
1227460	1232100	A lot of this drama just seems to be based on competing self-interest.
1232100	1234400	YouTubers want people to watch their videos.
1234400	1237060	Streamers want to watch what they want on their streams.
1237060	1239140	Viewers tend to side with whoever their guy is.
1239140	1244060	But ignoring all of that obvious self-interest, it seems to me that the fair thing to do,
1244060	1248840	such that everyone's interests are somewhat respected, is for streamers to ask for permission
1248840	1250440	and give proper credit.
1250440	1252840	Unless they actually transform the content.
1252840	1253840	Then it becomes theirs.
1253840	1256860	But since most of them don't, consent and credit.
1256860	1260460	Two concepts that I don't actually expect progressive Twitch poll streamers to ever
1260460	1261460	truly understand.
