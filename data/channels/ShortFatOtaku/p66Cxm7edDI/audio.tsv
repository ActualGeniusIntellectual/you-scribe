0	4720	Hollywood's awards shows always suck. That's it. That's the end of the video.
7200	11760	Alright, I guess I can talk about it for a little bit. Ricky Gervais hosted the Golden Globes
11760	17600	a couple of days ago, and it was absolutely hilarious. I'll play you a few choice bits
17600	22560	of the speech right now, even though it's probably going to get copyright struck on YouTube. But you
22560	26320	know what, this video will be up on my Bitchute channel, and I am the kind of guy that just
26320	30320	doesn't care if somebody wants to falsely copyright claim a video of mine on YouTube.
30320	33680	I'll work through the appeals process and get it back. Or I'll put it on a
33680	37200	side channel or something, I don't care. Anyway, check this out.
37200	42480	We were going to do an in memoriam this year, but when I saw the list of people that had died,
42480	50320	it wasn't diverse enough. It just, no. It was mostly white people. And I thought, nah,
50320	58560	not on my watch. Maybe next year. Let's see what happens. Spoiler alert,
58560	63440	season two is on the way. So in the end, he obviously didn't kill himself. Just like Jeffrey
63440	71600	Epstein. Shut up. I know he's your friend, but I don't care. Apple roared into the TV game with
71600	80800	a morning show, a superb drama. Yeah. A superb drama about the importance of dignity and doing
80800	86400	the right thing made by a company that runs sweatshops in China. So, well, you say you woke,
86400	92080	but the companies you work for, I mean, unbelievable. Apple, Amazon, Disney. If ISIS
92080	97440	started a streaming service, you'd call your agent, wouldn't you? So if you do win an award tonight,
98400	103200	don't use it as a platform to make a political speech. You're in no position to lecture the
103200	108240	public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in
108240	114960	school than Greta Thunberg. So if you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent
114960	124400	and your God. Probably the best reactions of that whole thing were Tom Hanks and the CEO of Apple.
124400	128640	But Ricky Gervais spent his time at that podium basically speaking truth to power.
128640	133520	And considering that the act of speaking truth to power is something that the progressives like to
133520	138480	lean on quite a bit, you think they'd be happy that he did this. However, considering that it's
138480	143440	their power he's speaking to, or more specifically, the power of the virtue signaling hyper left
143440	148960	Hollywood elites, they're actually all quite angry about it. Just how big a jerk was Ricky Gervais
148960	155040	at the Golden Globes? Oh no, are you going to be okay? It feels like Lilith is like creeping into
155040	160960	every single one of my videos nowadays, man. Ricky Gervais' Golden Globes jokes ranked in order of
160960	166000	dickishness from the righteously provocative to just plain mean, as if the people he was
166000	171760	talking to aren't both constantly righteously provocative and just plain mean. Politics
171760	176080	reigned at the Golden Globes. Too bad Ricky Gervais didn't notice. No, the whole point is
176080	182000	that he noticed. He noticed and he wanted you self-righteous moral grandstanders to shut the
182000	186160	fuck up. This one's from the LA Times, by the way, and it's actually kind of interesting, so let's
186160	191360	dig into it a little bit. Forget the escapist magic of Hollywood, nihilism was the name of the game
191360	196320	when host Ricky Gervais opened the Golden Globes on Sunday night with a gloom and doom monologue
196320	201920	so cynical it made the effervescent Tom Hanks scowl. You know, and I'm gonna have to do a
201920	206560	major video on this at some point because it covers New Guy, the New Guy meme, and it covers
206560	211360	this, but doom and gloom is the only thing that the radical left is selling right now. You know,
211360	216400	you've heard it all before, right? Climate change, the US is a tyranny run by Donald Trump, endless
216400	220560	wars in the Middle East, everything that we do is terrible, and in fact they even go so far as
220560	224960	to contradict themselves to keep the doom and gloom machine running. You know, they want American
224960	230320	troops out of the Middle East, fair enough. Well until they don't, which was the topic of my last
230320	235120	video, they see everything through a lens of doom and gloom. So even when the things that they
235120	239600	campaigned for, say six months ago, actually start to happen, they start complaining about it.
239600	246640	Meryl Streep shook her head, Eddie Murphy refused to smile, Quentin Tarantino looked more disturbed
246640	252080	than usual. Eddie Murphy? Even he's not cracking a smile, this must have been serious. Of course,
252080	257120	to be fair, Eddie Murphy's not that funny himself nowadays, is he? Eddie Murphy says his past jokes
257120	262720	about gay people make him cringe, saying he was a kid and the jokes were made in the context of
262720	267200	the time. Oh, what context was that, Eddie? The context in which you could make a boatload of
267200	272640	money? See this? This is the face of a man who morally grandstands, but not only does he do
272640	277600	that, he's the kind of guy that pulls the ladder back up after he's already gotten rich off of this
277600	283200	sort of stuff. Yeah, okay, okay, back in the 80s, indulge in all the edgy humor you want, but now,
283200	288080	no, sir, it's 30, 40 years in the future, now you have to shut the fuck up, now that stuff's
288080	293280	no longer allowed. It's really kind of disgusting to watch all these people just pat each other on
293280	298320	the back and talk about how moral and how virtuous they are, when they're completely willing to
298320	303680	chastise new people coming up the ranks for doing the exact same stuff they got famous for,
303680	308160	especially when, like Ricky Gervais said, they have no idea what the real world's like.
308160	311680	The Golden Globes' mood was already sober thanks to an impeachment,
311680	316160	threat of war with Iran and Australian bushfires. The last thing anyone needed was Ricky Gervais
316160	320720	there telling them they sucked. Well, they do suck, and you know what? They're big boys and
320720	326000	girls, they can take it, and none of those people there have to worry about an impeachment or a war
326000	331040	with Iran or the Australian bushfires because they are the mega rich. You know, when all those
331040	336080	bougie champagne socialists talk about eating the rich, these are the people they're talking about.
336080	342000	Hey moviebob, how have you been? The fake, self-flagellating, let's have Gervais roast
342000	347920	people lol thing has turned into the grossest faux-popula spectacle outside the Razzies,
347920	353440	and the Razzies are shit. Posh Brit reheating leftover 4chan dunks on marginalized people
353440	359840	whose wealth is supposed to make it okay. You literally just referred to millionaires
359840	367360	and billionaires of the Hollywood elite as marginalized. Are you fucking insane, dude?
368080	375520	Seriously, are you? Who? Oh, moviebob, listen, they're never going to like you,
375520	378320	and you are never going to be one of them. Give it up.
378320	382800	Hey moviebob, remember when the exact same thing happened only that it was flipped on the
382800	388240	political axis? You know, when Stephen Colbert waltzed into the president's dinner and did a
388240	391520	comedy thing where he told the president to his face what he thought of him?
391520	397920	I stand by this man. I stand by this man because he stands for things. Not only for things,
397920	405280	he stands on things. Things like aircraft carriers and rubble and recently flooded city squares.
406800	412720	And that sends a strong message that no matter what happens to America, she will always rebound
412720	416160	with the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world.
416880	420720	And you know what? That was speaking truth to power, wasn't it? The president was really
420720	425360	pissed off about that. You know, that shit LA Times article even said that Gervais should have
425920	432400	read the room to avoid offending his audience. Well, Stephen Colbert didn't read the room then,
432400	437200	did he? When he shat Oliver Bush and all the White House press correspondents that followed him
437200	443600	around. Oh, but that's alright with you, isn't it, moviebob? This isn't Colbert or Naomi Wolf
443600	447200	at the White House correspondents dinner trashing Bush and the spineless journos.
447200	451760	Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This is completely different. There is no way these situations
451760	459200	are comparable. That was speaking truth to power. This is a phony gloss of class resentment.
459200	463280	I'm going to have to start a video series where I literally just read moviebob's Twitter feed
463280	469120	because every single thing that he says is some of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard.
469760	473680	It's kind of crazy how consistently wild he is. Something else that we missed, though,
473680	477840	regarding the Golden Globes was this little exchange coming out of Joaquin Phoenix
477840	480080	regarding the Joker movie. Check this out.
493280	522080	Is it really that necessary to be such a dick?
522080	528080	Well, considering that the journalistic class was just begging and praying and hoping for some kind
528080	534000	of a violent event to happen at a Joker screening the entire time in order to scapegoat the movie
534000	539920	and Phoenix himself and incels and validate their inane conspiracy theory, I am completely
539920	543360	okay with this guy treating journalists like shit. Here I'll just read the take from one of my
543360	547840	friends because it honestly sums up how I feel as well. Imagine being sympathetic to those vultures
547840	556880	because he politely told them to fuck off and move on. Journalists can suck a fart out of my
556880	563760	asshole, to be honest, lads. Alright, thanks Jess. But you know what? I'm just done with this stuff.
563760	567680	We all know that the Golden Globes, the Oscars, every other award show, for the most part,
567680	571600	they're all rigged. It's just people who are giving themselves pats in the back and then
571600	576160	they get their little award and they go up there and they give a speech, basically virtue signaling
576160	580160	to the entire crowd about how woke they are and therefore how hireable they have to be in
580160	585120	Hollywood because Hollywood's ridiculously left wing. And then it's real. I no longer have any
585120	588960	faith that these award shows are places where quality is bubbling to the surface. And there's
588960	593840	been this divide for a while now between the critics and the actual public. I think one of my
593840	599120	next videos coming up will be a video on the fall of Rotten Tomatoes because frankly Rotten Tomatoes
599120	604880	was once amazing and it now sucks. But in general though, there's this idea among like the Twitterati
604880	611840	left where when the average person doesn't like a Ghostbusters 2016 or a Star Wars The Last Jedi,
611840	616880	you know, it's because it's too political. And what too political they think means is that it
616880	623920	includes politics that they don't like, you know, like LGBTQ representation or feminism or socialism
623920	627120	or something along those lines. But what it actually means is that we don't want a movie to
627120	631680	preach to us. There are many bits of political cinema that I enjoy. You know, I am happy with
631680	636720	the political Star Trek. They did it. It's called Deep Space Nine. But you know what? That show
636720	642000	didn't preach to me that much. It had a few preachy episodes, but for the most part the good episodes
642000	646800	were the ones that were political because they actually presented a moral dilemma
646800	652240	where there wasn't a very clear, you know, this side politics good, that side politics bad. But
652240	657360	it was actually, oh, there's multiple views here. They all have a point and we have to choose an
657360	663440	imperfect solution. That is what good political drama is. Not preaching. And keep in mind,
663440	670000	these same people who complain that we think things are too political when that's not actually
670000	674080	what they mean, but let's just take it on its face value. They think that. Well, you know what?
674080	677760	They're the same people that turn around and screech that video games are too violent or
677760	682400	they're not inclusive enough or they're too misogynistic. So it's actually not that media is
682400	687280	not political enough or too political. It's just not woke enough. And if media can't be
687840	694320	twisted and turned into a propagandizing mouthpiece for their politics, well, then they
694320	697520	consider it oppressive. You know, this is definitely unrelated, but I think it's a good
697520	702080	place to talk about it because all these people share the same. You can't be neutral on a moving
702080	706400	train philosophy. I think that term was popularly used by Ania Sarkeesian, though I'm not sure if
706400	710400	you actually coined it or not. It basically means that you're for our politics or you're against
710400	715280	them. If you're neutral to them or you represent some third way, you might as well just be against
715280	719200	them. It's either it's for or against, which is why the saying is you can't stand still on a
719200	723680	moving train. Sorry, because you're always moving in one direction or another, which is why, you
723680	729280	know, communists and the Antifa types view all anyone who's not them as fascists. So anyway,
729280	733600	I was talking with this call me on Twitter and I got a few I got a few choice takes out of her.
733600	737680	For example, even though she said initially that she was completely peaceful over the course of
737680	741680	our conversation, I got her to admit that she would attack people trying to defend their private
741680	748560	property and that she would consider such an attack a defensive action because the very act of
748560	752720	owning private property, you know, beyond your house, because they have this this stupid
752720	757040	distinction between private and personal property. The very act of owning property is an affront
757040	762720	against the collective. I got her to insult working class people that don't want a socialist
762800	768000	revolution. And I think most importantly to this discussion, I got her to admit that not only does
768000	773120	she desire to propagandize the population to be pro socialist, but that she believes anyone with
773120	778320	a large platform has a moral obligation to do so. Anyone who is simply neutral on the topic,
778320	783040	let alone talking about an alternative political position is a counter revolutionary element,
783040	787600	counter revolutionary elements that need to be killed, by the way, because she views
787600	793360	individualism as an individualist hell. Her words, not mine. Now this seems unrelated,
793360	798240	and maybe it kind of is on some level, but people like this, these no names on Twitter,
798960	805440	they are the ground troops, the shock forces for the Hollywood elite. As strange as it sounds,
805440	809520	you know, when some woke schooled actress gets her award at the Golden Globes and then gives
809520	814560	some speech about orange man bad or Iran or global warming or whatever the fuck it is,
814560	821040	that person is relying on and is reinforced by a thousand Yas queen sleighs from the Twitter
821040	825520	plebs. Like all the champagne socialists I've been dealing with the past couple of days.
825520	829760	Basically, if Hollywood were gathering a spirit bomb, these people would be who they're taking
829760	834480	the soul power from. And when Ricky Gervais beats them to the punch and basically tells them all to
834480	840080	shut up, it's hilariously funny. But then when they don't, and by the way, they didn't, every
840080	845680	single person who got an award gave some inane speech anyway, it just makes them sound hollow.
845680	849040	It makes it sound like the words falling out of their mouth. They don't even believe anymore
849040	852080	because they've already been told off before they even had the chance to say them. It's kind of
852080	857120	incredible. Anyway, no, fuck Hollywood, dude. I'm not even going to necessarily agree with
857120	861520	Ricky Gervais on this one because he said fuck Hollywood because fuck movies. Everyone's going
861520	866800	to Netflix and streaming. I mean, yeah, kinda, but Netflix is going down the shitter too.
866800	872080	For me, it's more like, fuck Hollywood, watch YouTubers. I know I'm biased, but I watch so
872080	876720	much more YouTube than I do anything coming out of Hollywood. And yeah, YouTube's shit right now,
876720	883680	but you know what I mean? You and me, we can do better than these people. Maybe not in terms of
883680	887600	special effects, maybe not even in terms of writing though. I'm pretty sure I could outright
887600	890640	most of the writers in Hollywood at this point, if you don't mind me tooting my own horn a little
890640	895600	bit. But in terms of having a soul, yeah, we got these people beat.
