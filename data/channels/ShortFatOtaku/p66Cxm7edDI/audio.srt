1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Hollywood's awards shows always suck. That's it. That's the end of the video.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,760
Alright, I guess I can talk about it for a little bit. Ricky Gervais hosted the Golden Globes

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,600
a couple of days ago, and it was absolutely hilarious. I'll play you a few choice bits

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,560
of the speech right now, even though it's probably going to get copyright struck on YouTube. But you

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,320
know what, this video will be up on my Bitchute channel, and I am the kind of guy that just

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,320
doesn't care if somebody wants to falsely copyright claim a video of mine on YouTube.

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,680
I'll work through the appeals process and get it back. Or I'll put it on a

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,200
side channel or something, I don't care. Anyway, check this out.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,480
We were going to do an in memoriam this year, but when I saw the list of people that had died,

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:50,320
it wasn't diverse enough. It just, no. It was mostly white people. And I thought, nah,

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:58,560
not on my watch. Maybe next year. Let's see what happens. Spoiler alert,

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,440
season two is on the way. So in the end, he obviously didn't kill himself. Just like Jeffrey

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:11,600
Epstein. Shut up. I know he's your friend, but I don't care. Apple roared into the TV game with

14
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:20,800
a morning show, a superb drama. Yeah. A superb drama about the importance of dignity and doing

15
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,400
the right thing made by a company that runs sweatshops in China. So, well, you say you woke,

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,080
but the companies you work for, I mean, unbelievable. Apple, Amazon, Disney. If ISIS

17
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,440
started a streaming service, you'd call your agent, wouldn't you? So if you do win an award tonight,

18
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,200
don't use it as a platform to make a political speech. You're in no position to lecture the

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,240
public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in

20
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,960
school than Greta Thunberg. So if you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent

21
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:04,400
and your God. Probably the best reactions of that whole thing were Tom Hanks and the CEO of Apple.

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,640
But Ricky Gervais spent his time at that podium basically speaking truth to power.

23
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,520
And considering that the act of speaking truth to power is something that the progressives like to

24
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,480
lean on quite a bit, you think they'd be happy that he did this. However, considering that it's

25
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,440
their power he's speaking to, or more specifically, the power of the virtue signaling hyper left

26
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,960
Hollywood elites, they're actually all quite angry about it. Just how big a jerk was Ricky Gervais

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:35,040
at the Golden Globes? Oh no, are you going to be okay? It feels like Lilith is like creeping into

28
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,960
every single one of my videos nowadays, man. Ricky Gervais' Golden Globes jokes ranked in order of

29
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,000
dickishness from the righteously provocative to just plain mean, as if the people he was

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,760
talking to aren't both constantly righteously provocative and just plain mean. Politics

31
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,080
reigned at the Golden Globes. Too bad Ricky Gervais didn't notice. No, the whole point is

32
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,000
that he noticed. He noticed and he wanted you self-righteous moral grandstanders to shut the

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,160
fuck up. This one's from the LA Times, by the way, and it's actually kind of interesting, so let's

34
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,360
dig into it a little bit. Forget the escapist magic of Hollywood, nihilism was the name of the game

35
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,320
when host Ricky Gervais opened the Golden Globes on Sunday night with a gloom and doom monologue

36
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,920
so cynical it made the effervescent Tom Hanks scowl. You know, and I'm gonna have to do a

37
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,560
major video on this at some point because it covers New Guy, the New Guy meme, and it covers

38
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,360
this, but doom and gloom is the only thing that the radical left is selling right now. You know,

39
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,400
you've heard it all before, right? Climate change, the US is a tyranny run by Donald Trump, endless

40
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,560
wars in the Middle East, everything that we do is terrible, and in fact they even go so far as

41
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,960
to contradict themselves to keep the doom and gloom machine running. You know, they want American

42
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,320
troops out of the Middle East, fair enough. Well until they don't, which was the topic of my last

43
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,120
video, they see everything through a lens of doom and gloom. So even when the things that they

44
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,600
campaigned for, say six months ago, actually start to happen, they start complaining about it.

45
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,640
Meryl Streep shook her head, Eddie Murphy refused to smile, Quentin Tarantino looked more disturbed

46
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,080
than usual. Eddie Murphy? Even he's not cracking a smile, this must have been serious. Of course,

47
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,120
to be fair, Eddie Murphy's not that funny himself nowadays, is he? Eddie Murphy says his past jokes

48
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,720
about gay people make him cringe, saying he was a kid and the jokes were made in the context of

49
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,200
the time. Oh, what context was that, Eddie? The context in which you could make a boatload of

50
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,640
money? See this? This is the face of a man who morally grandstands, but not only does he do

51
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,600
that, he's the kind of guy that pulls the ladder back up after he's already gotten rich off of this

52
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,200
sort of stuff. Yeah, okay, okay, back in the 80s, indulge in all the edgy humor you want, but now,

53
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,080
no, sir, it's 30, 40 years in the future, now you have to shut the fuck up, now that stuff's

54
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,280
no longer allowed. It's really kind of disgusting to watch all these people just pat each other on

55
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,320
the back and talk about how moral and how virtuous they are, when they're completely willing to

56
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,680
chastise new people coming up the ranks for doing the exact same stuff they got famous for,

57
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,160
especially when, like Ricky Gervais said, they have no idea what the real world's like.

58
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,680
The Golden Globes' mood was already sober thanks to an impeachment,

59
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,160
threat of war with Iran and Australian bushfires. The last thing anyone needed was Ricky Gervais

60
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,720
there telling them they sucked. Well, they do suck, and you know what? They're big boys and

61
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,000
girls, they can take it, and none of those people there have to worry about an impeachment or a war

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,040
with Iran or the Australian bushfires because they are the mega rich. You know, when all those

63
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,080
bougie champagne socialists talk about eating the rich, these are the people they're talking about.

64
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,000
Hey moviebob, how have you been? The fake, self-flagellating, let's have Gervais roast

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,920
people lol thing has turned into the grossest faux-popula spectacle outside the Razzies,

66
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,440
and the Razzies are shit. Posh Brit reheating leftover 4chan dunks on marginalized people

67
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,840
whose wealth is supposed to make it okay. You literally just referred to millionaires

68
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:07,360
and billionaires of the Hollywood elite as marginalized. Are you fucking insane, dude?

69
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:15,520
Seriously, are you? Who? Oh, moviebob, listen, they're never going to like you,

70
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,320
and you are never going to be one of them. Give it up.

71
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,800
Hey moviebob, remember when the exact same thing happened only that it was flipped on the

72
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,240
political axis? You know, when Stephen Colbert waltzed into the president's dinner and did a

73
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,520
comedy thing where he told the president to his face what he thought of him?

74
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,920
I stand by this man. I stand by this man because he stands for things. Not only for things,

75
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:45,280
he stands on things. Things like aircraft carriers and rubble and recently flooded city squares.

76
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,720
And that sends a strong message that no matter what happens to America, she will always rebound

77
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,160
with the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world.

78
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,720
And you know what? That was speaking truth to power, wasn't it? The president was really

79
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,360
pissed off about that. You know, that shit LA Times article even said that Gervais should have

80
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:12,400
read the room to avoid offending his audience. Well, Stephen Colbert didn't read the room then,

81
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,200
did he? When he shat Oliver Bush and all the White House press correspondents that followed him

82
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,600
around. Oh, but that's alright with you, isn't it, moviebob? This isn't Colbert or Naomi Wolf

83
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,200
at the White House correspondents dinner trashing Bush and the spineless journos.

84
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,760
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This is completely different. There is no way these situations

85
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:39,200
are comparable. That was speaking truth to power. This is a phony gloss of class resentment.

86
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,280
I'm going to have to start a video series where I literally just read moviebob's Twitter feed

87
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,120
because every single thing that he says is some of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard.

88
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,680
It's kind of crazy how consistently wild he is. Something else that we missed, though,

89
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,840
regarding the Golden Globes was this little exchange coming out of Joaquin Phoenix

90
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,080
regarding the Joker movie. Check this out.

91
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:42,080
Is it really that necessary to be such a dick?

92
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,080
Well, considering that the journalistic class was just begging and praying and hoping for some kind

93
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,000
of a violent event to happen at a Joker screening the entire time in order to scapegoat the movie

94
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,920
and Phoenix himself and incels and validate their inane conspiracy theory, I am completely

95
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,360
okay with this guy treating journalists like shit. Here I'll just read the take from one of my

96
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,840
friends because it honestly sums up how I feel as well. Imagine being sympathetic to those vultures

97
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:16,880
because he politely told them to fuck off and move on. Journalists can suck a fart out of my

98
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,760
asshole, to be honest, lads. Alright, thanks Jess. But you know what? I'm just done with this stuff.

99
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,680
We all know that the Golden Globes, the Oscars, every other award show, for the most part,

100
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,600
they're all rigged. It's just people who are giving themselves pats in the back and then

101
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,160
they get their little award and they go up there and they give a speech, basically virtue signaling

102
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,160
to the entire crowd about how woke they are and therefore how hireable they have to be in

103
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,120
Hollywood because Hollywood's ridiculously left wing. And then it's real. I no longer have any

104
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,960
faith that these award shows are places where quality is bubbling to the surface. And there's

105
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,840
been this divide for a while now between the critics and the actual public. I think one of my

106
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,120
next videos coming up will be a video on the fall of Rotten Tomatoes because frankly Rotten Tomatoes

107
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,880
was once amazing and it now sucks. But in general though, there's this idea among like the Twitterati

108
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:11,840
left where when the average person doesn't like a Ghostbusters 2016 or a Star Wars The Last Jedi,

109
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,880
you know, it's because it's too political. And what too political they think means is that it

110
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,920
includes politics that they don't like, you know, like LGBTQ representation or feminism or socialism

111
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,120
or something along those lines. But what it actually means is that we don't want a movie to

112
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,680
preach to us. There are many bits of political cinema that I enjoy. You know, I am happy with

113
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,720
the political Star Trek. They did it. It's called Deep Space Nine. But you know what? That show

114
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,000
didn't preach to me that much. It had a few preachy episodes, but for the most part the good episodes

115
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,800
were the ones that were political because they actually presented a moral dilemma

116
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,240
where there wasn't a very clear, you know, this side politics good, that side politics bad. But

117
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,360
it was actually, oh, there's multiple views here. They all have a point and we have to choose an

118
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,440
imperfect solution. That is what good political drama is. Not preaching. And keep in mind,

119
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:10,000
these same people who complain that we think things are too political when that's not actually

120
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,080
what they mean, but let's just take it on its face value. They think that. Well, you know what?

121
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,760
They're the same people that turn around and screech that video games are too violent or

122
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,400
they're not inclusive enough or they're too misogynistic. So it's actually not that media is

123
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,280
not political enough or too political. It's just not woke enough. And if media can't be

124
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:34,320
twisted and turned into a propagandizing mouthpiece for their politics, well, then they

125
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,520
consider it oppressive. You know, this is definitely unrelated, but I think it's a good

126
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,080
place to talk about it because all these people share the same. You can't be neutral on a moving

127
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,400
train philosophy. I think that term was popularly used by Ania Sarkeesian, though I'm not sure if

128
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,400
you actually coined it or not. It basically means that you're for our politics or you're against

129
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,280
them. If you're neutral to them or you represent some third way, you might as well just be against

130
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,200
them. It's either it's for or against, which is why the saying is you can't stand still on a

131
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,680
moving train. Sorry, because you're always moving in one direction or another, which is why, you

132
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,280
know, communists and the Antifa types view all anyone who's not them as fascists. So anyway,

133
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,600
I was talking with this call me on Twitter and I got a few I got a few choice takes out of her.

134
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,680
For example, even though she said initially that she was completely peaceful over the course of

135
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,680
our conversation, I got her to admit that she would attack people trying to defend their private

136
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,560
property and that she would consider such an attack a defensive action because the very act of

137
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,720
owning private property, you know, beyond your house, because they have this this stupid

138
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,040
distinction between private and personal property. The very act of owning property is an affront

139
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,720
against the collective. I got her to insult working class people that don't want a socialist

140
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,000
revolution. And I think most importantly to this discussion, I got her to admit that not only does

141
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,120
she desire to propagandize the population to be pro socialist, but that she believes anyone with

142
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,320
a large platform has a moral obligation to do so. Anyone who is simply neutral on the topic,

143
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,040
let alone talking about an alternative political position is a counter revolutionary element,

144
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,600
counter revolutionary elements that need to be killed, by the way, because she views

145
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,360
individualism as an individualist hell. Her words, not mine. Now this seems unrelated,

146
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,240
and maybe it kind of is on some level, but people like this, these no names on Twitter,

147
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:25,440
they are the ground troops, the shock forces for the Hollywood elite. As strange as it sounds,

148
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,520
you know, when some woke schooled actress gets her award at the Golden Globes and then gives

149
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,560
some speech about orange man bad or Iran or global warming or whatever the fuck it is,

150
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,040
that person is relying on and is reinforced by a thousand Yas queen sleighs from the Twitter

151
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,520
plebs. Like all the champagne socialists I've been dealing with the past couple of days.

152
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,760
Basically, if Hollywood were gathering a spirit bomb, these people would be who they're taking

153
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,480
the soul power from. And when Ricky Gervais beats them to the punch and basically tells them all to

154
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,080
shut up, it's hilariously funny. But then when they don't, and by the way, they didn't, every

155
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,680
single person who got an award gave some inane speech anyway, it just makes them sound hollow.

156
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,040
It makes it sound like the words falling out of their mouth. They don't even believe anymore

157
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,080
because they've already been told off before they even had the chance to say them. It's kind of

158
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,120
incredible. Anyway, no, fuck Hollywood, dude. I'm not even going to necessarily agree with

159
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,520
Ricky Gervais on this one because he said fuck Hollywood because fuck movies. Everyone's going

160
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,800
to Netflix and streaming. I mean, yeah, kinda, but Netflix is going down the shitter too.

161
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,080
For me, it's more like, fuck Hollywood, watch YouTubers. I know I'm biased, but I watch so

162
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,720
much more YouTube than I do anything coming out of Hollywood. And yeah, YouTube's shit right now,

163
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:43,680
but you know what I mean? You and me, we can do better than these people. Maybe not in terms of

164
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,600
special effects, maybe not even in terms of writing though. I'm pretty sure I could outright

165
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,640
most of the writers in Hollywood at this point, if you don't mind me tooting my own horn a little

166
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,600
bit. But in terms of having a soul, yeah, we got these people beat.
