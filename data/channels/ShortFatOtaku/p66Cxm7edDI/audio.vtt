WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
Hollywood's awards shows always suck. That's it. That's the end of the video.

00:07.200 --> 00:11.760
Alright, I guess I can talk about it for a little bit. Ricky Gervais hosted the Golden Globes

00:11.760 --> 00:17.600
a couple of days ago, and it was absolutely hilarious. I'll play you a few choice bits

00:17.600 --> 00:22.560
of the speech right now, even though it's probably going to get copyright struck on YouTube. But you

00:22.560 --> 00:26.320
know what, this video will be up on my Bitchute channel, and I am the kind of guy that just

00:26.320 --> 00:30.320
doesn't care if somebody wants to falsely copyright claim a video of mine on YouTube.

00:30.320 --> 00:33.680
I'll work through the appeals process and get it back. Or I'll put it on a

00:33.680 --> 00:37.200
side channel or something, I don't care. Anyway, check this out.

00:37.200 --> 00:42.480
We were going to do an in memoriam this year, but when I saw the list of people that had died,

00:42.480 --> 00:50.320
it wasn't diverse enough. It just, no. It was mostly white people. And I thought, nah,

00:50.320 --> 00:58.560
not on my watch. Maybe next year. Let's see what happens. Spoiler alert,

00:58.560 --> 01:03.440
season two is on the way. So in the end, he obviously didn't kill himself. Just like Jeffrey

01:03.440 --> 01:11.600
Epstein. Shut up. I know he's your friend, but I don't care. Apple roared into the TV game with

01:11.600 --> 01:20.800
a morning show, a superb drama. Yeah. A superb drama about the importance of dignity and doing

01:20.800 --> 01:26.400
the right thing made by a company that runs sweatshops in China. So, well, you say you woke,

01:26.400 --> 01:32.080
but the companies you work for, I mean, unbelievable. Apple, Amazon, Disney. If ISIS

01:32.080 --> 01:37.440
started a streaming service, you'd call your agent, wouldn't you? So if you do win an award tonight,

01:38.400 --> 01:43.200
don't use it as a platform to make a political speech. You're in no position to lecture the

01:43.200 --> 01:48.240
public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in

01:48.240 --> 01:54.960
school than Greta Thunberg. So if you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent

01:54.960 --> 02:04.400
and your God. Probably the best reactions of that whole thing were Tom Hanks and the CEO of Apple.

02:04.400 --> 02:08.640
But Ricky Gervais spent his time at that podium basically speaking truth to power.

02:08.640 --> 02:13.520
And considering that the act of speaking truth to power is something that the progressives like to

02:13.520 --> 02:18.480
lean on quite a bit, you think they'd be happy that he did this. However, considering that it's

02:18.480 --> 02:23.440
their power he's speaking to, or more specifically, the power of the virtue signaling hyper left

02:23.440 --> 02:28.960
Hollywood elites, they're actually all quite angry about it. Just how big a jerk was Ricky Gervais

02:28.960 --> 02:35.040
at the Golden Globes? Oh no, are you going to be okay? It feels like Lilith is like creeping into

02:35.040 --> 02:40.960
every single one of my videos nowadays, man. Ricky Gervais' Golden Globes jokes ranked in order of

02:40.960 --> 02:46.000
dickishness from the righteously provocative to just plain mean, as if the people he was

02:46.000 --> 02:51.760
talking to aren't both constantly righteously provocative and just plain mean. Politics

02:51.760 --> 02:56.080
reigned at the Golden Globes. Too bad Ricky Gervais didn't notice. No, the whole point is

02:56.080 --> 03:02.000
that he noticed. He noticed and he wanted you self-righteous moral grandstanders to shut the

03:02.000 --> 03:06.160
fuck up. This one's from the LA Times, by the way, and it's actually kind of interesting, so let's

03:06.160 --> 03:11.360
dig into it a little bit. Forget the escapist magic of Hollywood, nihilism was the name of the game

03:11.360 --> 03:16.320
when host Ricky Gervais opened the Golden Globes on Sunday night with a gloom and doom monologue

03:16.320 --> 03:21.920
so cynical it made the effervescent Tom Hanks scowl. You know, and I'm gonna have to do a

03:21.920 --> 03:26.560
major video on this at some point because it covers New Guy, the New Guy meme, and it covers

03:26.560 --> 03:31.360
this, but doom and gloom is the only thing that the radical left is selling right now. You know,

03:31.360 --> 03:36.400
you've heard it all before, right? Climate change, the US is a tyranny run by Donald Trump, endless

03:36.400 --> 03:40.560
wars in the Middle East, everything that we do is terrible, and in fact they even go so far as

03:40.560 --> 03:44.960
to contradict themselves to keep the doom and gloom machine running. You know, they want American

03:44.960 --> 03:50.320
troops out of the Middle East, fair enough. Well until they don't, which was the topic of my last

03:50.320 --> 03:55.120
video, they see everything through a lens of doom and gloom. So even when the things that they

03:55.120 --> 03:59.600
campaigned for, say six months ago, actually start to happen, they start complaining about it.

03:59.600 --> 04:06.640
Meryl Streep shook her head, Eddie Murphy refused to smile, Quentin Tarantino looked more disturbed

04:06.640 --> 04:12.080
than usual. Eddie Murphy? Even he's not cracking a smile, this must have been serious. Of course,

04:12.080 --> 04:17.120
to be fair, Eddie Murphy's not that funny himself nowadays, is he? Eddie Murphy says his past jokes

04:17.120 --> 04:22.720
about gay people make him cringe, saying he was a kid and the jokes were made in the context of

04:22.720 --> 04:27.200
the time. Oh, what context was that, Eddie? The context in which you could make a boatload of

04:27.200 --> 04:32.640
money? See this? This is the face of a man who morally grandstands, but not only does he do

04:32.640 --> 04:37.600
that, he's the kind of guy that pulls the ladder back up after he's already gotten rich off of this

04:37.600 --> 04:43.200
sort of stuff. Yeah, okay, okay, back in the 80s, indulge in all the edgy humor you want, but now,

04:43.200 --> 04:48.080
no, sir, it's 30, 40 years in the future, now you have to shut the fuck up, now that stuff's

04:48.080 --> 04:53.280
no longer allowed. It's really kind of disgusting to watch all these people just pat each other on

04:53.280 --> 04:58.320
the back and talk about how moral and how virtuous they are, when they're completely willing to

04:58.320 --> 05:03.680
chastise new people coming up the ranks for doing the exact same stuff they got famous for,

05:03.680 --> 05:08.160
especially when, like Ricky Gervais said, they have no idea what the real world's like.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.680
The Golden Globes' mood was already sober thanks to an impeachment,

05:11.680 --> 05:16.160
threat of war with Iran and Australian bushfires. The last thing anyone needed was Ricky Gervais

05:16.160 --> 05:20.720
there telling them they sucked. Well, they do suck, and you know what? They're big boys and

05:20.720 --> 05:26.000
girls, they can take it, and none of those people there have to worry about an impeachment or a war

05:26.000 --> 05:31.040
with Iran or the Australian bushfires because they are the mega rich. You know, when all those

05:31.040 --> 05:36.080
bougie champagne socialists talk about eating the rich, these are the people they're talking about.

05:36.080 --> 05:42.000
Hey moviebob, how have you been? The fake, self-flagellating, let's have Gervais roast

05:42.000 --> 05:47.920
people lol thing has turned into the grossest faux-popula spectacle outside the Razzies,

05:47.920 --> 05:53.440
and the Razzies are shit. Posh Brit reheating leftover 4chan dunks on marginalized people

05:53.440 --> 05:59.840
whose wealth is supposed to make it okay. You literally just referred to millionaires

05:59.840 --> 06:07.360
and billionaires of the Hollywood elite as marginalized. Are you fucking insane, dude?

06:08.080 --> 06:15.520
Seriously, are you? Who? Oh, moviebob, listen, they're never going to like you,

06:15.520 --> 06:18.320
and you are never going to be one of them. Give it up.

06:18.320 --> 06:22.800
Hey moviebob, remember when the exact same thing happened only that it was flipped on the

06:22.800 --> 06:28.240
political axis? You know, when Stephen Colbert waltzed into the president's dinner and did a

06:28.240 --> 06:31.520
comedy thing where he told the president to his face what he thought of him?

06:31.520 --> 06:37.920
I stand by this man. I stand by this man because he stands for things. Not only for things,

06:37.920 --> 06:45.280
he stands on things. Things like aircraft carriers and rubble and recently flooded city squares.

06:46.800 --> 06:52.720
And that sends a strong message that no matter what happens to America, she will always rebound

06:52.720 --> 06:56.160
with the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world.

06:56.880 --> 07:00.720
And you know what? That was speaking truth to power, wasn't it? The president was really

07:00.720 --> 07:05.360
pissed off about that. You know, that shit LA Times article even said that Gervais should have

07:05.920 --> 07:12.400
read the room to avoid offending his audience. Well, Stephen Colbert didn't read the room then,

07:12.400 --> 07:17.200
did he? When he shat Oliver Bush and all the White House press correspondents that followed him

07:17.200 --> 07:23.600
around. Oh, but that's alright with you, isn't it, moviebob? This isn't Colbert or Naomi Wolf

07:23.600 --> 07:27.200
at the White House correspondents dinner trashing Bush and the spineless journos.

07:27.200 --> 07:31.760
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This is completely different. There is no way these situations

07:31.760 --> 07:39.200
are comparable. That was speaking truth to power. This is a phony gloss of class resentment.

07:39.200 --> 07:43.280
I'm going to have to start a video series where I literally just read moviebob's Twitter feed

07:43.280 --> 07:49.120
because every single thing that he says is some of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard.

07:49.760 --> 07:53.680
It's kind of crazy how consistently wild he is. Something else that we missed, though,

07:53.680 --> 07:57.840
regarding the Golden Globes was this little exchange coming out of Joaquin Phoenix

07:57.840 --> 08:00.080
regarding the Joker movie. Check this out.

08:13.280 --> 08:42.080
Is it really that necessary to be such a dick?

08:42.080 --> 08:48.080
Well, considering that the journalistic class was just begging and praying and hoping for some kind

08:48.080 --> 08:54.000
of a violent event to happen at a Joker screening the entire time in order to scapegoat the movie

08:54.000 --> 08:59.920
and Phoenix himself and incels and validate their inane conspiracy theory, I am completely

08:59.920 --> 09:03.360
okay with this guy treating journalists like shit. Here I'll just read the take from one of my

09:03.360 --> 09:07.840
friends because it honestly sums up how I feel as well. Imagine being sympathetic to those vultures

09:07.840 --> 09:16.880
because he politely told them to fuck off and move on. Journalists can suck a fart out of my

09:16.880 --> 09:23.760
asshole, to be honest, lads. Alright, thanks Jess. But you know what? I'm just done with this stuff.

09:23.760 --> 09:27.680
We all know that the Golden Globes, the Oscars, every other award show, for the most part,

09:27.680 --> 09:31.600
they're all rigged. It's just people who are giving themselves pats in the back and then

09:31.600 --> 09:36.160
they get their little award and they go up there and they give a speech, basically virtue signaling

09:36.160 --> 09:40.160
to the entire crowd about how woke they are and therefore how hireable they have to be in

09:40.160 --> 09:45.120
Hollywood because Hollywood's ridiculously left wing. And then it's real. I no longer have any

09:45.120 --> 09:48.960
faith that these award shows are places where quality is bubbling to the surface. And there's

09:48.960 --> 09:53.840
been this divide for a while now between the critics and the actual public. I think one of my

09:53.840 --> 09:59.120
next videos coming up will be a video on the fall of Rotten Tomatoes because frankly Rotten Tomatoes

09:59.120 --> 10:04.880
was once amazing and it now sucks. But in general though, there's this idea among like the Twitterati

10:04.880 --> 10:11.840
left where when the average person doesn't like a Ghostbusters 2016 or a Star Wars The Last Jedi,

10:11.840 --> 10:16.880
you know, it's because it's too political. And what too political they think means is that it

10:16.880 --> 10:23.920
includes politics that they don't like, you know, like LGBTQ representation or feminism or socialism

10:23.920 --> 10:27.120
or something along those lines. But what it actually means is that we don't want a movie to

10:27.120 --> 10:31.680
preach to us. There are many bits of political cinema that I enjoy. You know, I am happy with

10:31.680 --> 10:36.720
the political Star Trek. They did it. It's called Deep Space Nine. But you know what? That show

10:36.720 --> 10:42.000
didn't preach to me that much. It had a few preachy episodes, but for the most part the good episodes

10:42.000 --> 10:46.800
were the ones that were political because they actually presented a moral dilemma

10:46.800 --> 10:52.240
where there wasn't a very clear, you know, this side politics good, that side politics bad. But

10:52.240 --> 10:57.360
it was actually, oh, there's multiple views here. They all have a point and we have to choose an

10:57.360 --> 11:03.440
imperfect solution. That is what good political drama is. Not preaching. And keep in mind,

11:03.440 --> 11:10.000
these same people who complain that we think things are too political when that's not actually

11:10.000 --> 11:14.080
what they mean, but let's just take it on its face value. They think that. Well, you know what?

11:14.080 --> 11:17.760
They're the same people that turn around and screech that video games are too violent or

11:17.760 --> 11:22.400
they're not inclusive enough or they're too misogynistic. So it's actually not that media is

11:22.400 --> 11:27.280
not political enough or too political. It's just not woke enough. And if media can't be

11:27.840 --> 11:34.320
twisted and turned into a propagandizing mouthpiece for their politics, well, then they

11:34.320 --> 11:37.520
consider it oppressive. You know, this is definitely unrelated, but I think it's a good

11:37.520 --> 11:42.080
place to talk about it because all these people share the same. You can't be neutral on a moving

11:42.080 --> 11:46.400
train philosophy. I think that term was popularly used by Ania Sarkeesian, though I'm not sure if

11:46.400 --> 11:50.400
you actually coined it or not. It basically means that you're for our politics or you're against

11:50.400 --> 11:55.280
them. If you're neutral to them or you represent some third way, you might as well just be against

11:55.280 --> 11:59.200
them. It's either it's for or against, which is why the saying is you can't stand still on a

11:59.200 --> 12:03.680
moving train. Sorry, because you're always moving in one direction or another, which is why, you

12:03.680 --> 12:09.280
know, communists and the Antifa types view all anyone who's not them as fascists. So anyway,

12:09.280 --> 12:13.600
I was talking with this call me on Twitter and I got a few I got a few choice takes out of her.

12:13.600 --> 12:17.680
For example, even though she said initially that she was completely peaceful over the course of

12:17.680 --> 12:21.680
our conversation, I got her to admit that she would attack people trying to defend their private

12:21.680 --> 12:28.560
property and that she would consider such an attack a defensive action because the very act of

12:28.560 --> 12:32.720
owning private property, you know, beyond your house, because they have this this stupid

12:32.720 --> 12:37.040
distinction between private and personal property. The very act of owning property is an affront

12:37.040 --> 12:42.720
against the collective. I got her to insult working class people that don't want a socialist

12:42.800 --> 12:48.000
revolution. And I think most importantly to this discussion, I got her to admit that not only does

12:48.000 --> 12:53.120
she desire to propagandize the population to be pro socialist, but that she believes anyone with

12:53.120 --> 12:58.320
a large platform has a moral obligation to do so. Anyone who is simply neutral on the topic,

12:58.320 --> 13:03.040
let alone talking about an alternative political position is a counter revolutionary element,

13:03.040 --> 13:07.600
counter revolutionary elements that need to be killed, by the way, because she views

13:07.600 --> 13:13.360
individualism as an individualist hell. Her words, not mine. Now this seems unrelated,

13:13.360 --> 13:18.240
and maybe it kind of is on some level, but people like this, these no names on Twitter,

13:18.960 --> 13:25.440
they are the ground troops, the shock forces for the Hollywood elite. As strange as it sounds,

13:25.440 --> 13:29.520
you know, when some woke schooled actress gets her award at the Golden Globes and then gives

13:29.520 --> 13:34.560
some speech about orange man bad or Iran or global warming or whatever the fuck it is,

13:34.560 --> 13:41.040
that person is relying on and is reinforced by a thousand Yas queen sleighs from the Twitter

13:41.040 --> 13:45.520
plebs. Like all the champagne socialists I've been dealing with the past couple of days.

13:45.520 --> 13:49.760
Basically, if Hollywood were gathering a spirit bomb, these people would be who they're taking

13:49.760 --> 13:54.480
the soul power from. And when Ricky Gervais beats them to the punch and basically tells them all to

13:54.480 --> 14:00.080
shut up, it's hilariously funny. But then when they don't, and by the way, they didn't, every

14:00.080 --> 14:05.680
single person who got an award gave some inane speech anyway, it just makes them sound hollow.

14:05.680 --> 14:09.040
It makes it sound like the words falling out of their mouth. They don't even believe anymore

14:09.040 --> 14:12.080
because they've already been told off before they even had the chance to say them. It's kind of

14:12.080 --> 14:17.120
incredible. Anyway, no, fuck Hollywood, dude. I'm not even going to necessarily agree with

14:17.120 --> 14:21.520
Ricky Gervais on this one because he said fuck Hollywood because fuck movies. Everyone's going

14:21.520 --> 14:26.800
to Netflix and streaming. I mean, yeah, kinda, but Netflix is going down the shitter too.

14:26.800 --> 14:32.080
For me, it's more like, fuck Hollywood, watch YouTubers. I know I'm biased, but I watch so

14:32.080 --> 14:36.720
much more YouTube than I do anything coming out of Hollywood. And yeah, YouTube's shit right now,

14:36.720 --> 14:43.680
but you know what I mean? You and me, we can do better than these people. Maybe not in terms of

14:43.680 --> 14:47.600
special effects, maybe not even in terms of writing though. I'm pretty sure I could outright

14:47.600 --> 14:50.640
most of the writers in Hollywood at this point, if you don't mind me tooting my own horn a little

14:50.640 --> 14:55.600
bit. But in terms of having a soul, yeah, we got these people beat.
