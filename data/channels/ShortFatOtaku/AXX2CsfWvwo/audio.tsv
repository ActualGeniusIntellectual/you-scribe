0	3920	The phrase, learn to code, was briefly trending on Twitter yesterday,
3920	7440	before Jack quietly but predictably suppressed the tag.
7440	12400	It was in reference to BuzzFeed laying off dozens of journalists in its news division,
12400	14240	as the media outlet restructures.
14240	19120	It's a slaughter, one employee who was not authorized to speak publicly told CNN Business.
19120	20560	The entire national desk,
20560	25520	which produced some of BuzzFeed News's most illustrious feature reporting, was cut.
25520	29600	The health desk was also slashed, and the national security desk was disbanded.
29600	33520	The website's LGBT desk, an area of coverage in which BuzzFeed News
33520	36960	had invested significant resources, was left with only one staffer.
36960	39200	The entertainment team also suffered some cuts.
39200	41600	In total, 43 people were let go on Friday.
41600	44000	Now you're not going to find me shedding a tear for these people.
44000	47760	BuzzFeed is, as Donald Trump once put it, a flaming pile of garbage.
48320	54800	As far as BuzzFeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it,
54800	57760	I think they're going to suffer the consequences, they already are.
57760	61840	They routinely publish unverified or even undisputably false stories,
61840	65600	and wrap all of it in sensationalist click-baity low-quality writing.
65600	68000	They produce almost nothing of any actual merit.
68000	72720	And they don't employ journalists, but ideological activists in journalist clothing.
72720	75920	Or at least they did, until they all got shown the door.
75920	78320	Other companies laid off people as well.
78320	80640	Gannet, Verizon, Oath, HuffPo.
80640	85120	As it turns out, ideological activism that the majority of the population, or hell,
85120	88880	the majority of your user base disagrees with, is not profitable.
88880	93120	This phenomenon is otherwise described by the catchy adage, get woke, go broke.
93120	95120	But where does the learn to code part come in?
95120	99600	Well, in the past, when the working class of Hinterland America suffered from layoffs,
99600	104480	firings, and factory closings, as the combination of globalist trade policies
104480	106080	shipping their jobs overseas,
106080	109520	and influxes of cheap labor into the market through mass migration
109520	113920	completely destroyed America's mining, manufacturing, and energy sectors,
113920	118880	these bourgeois upper-class journalists and bloggers sitting in their coastal elite offices
118880	121600	would write about how the working class should just learn to code.
121600	124160	Forget your old career, forget your old job market,
124160	126320	just learn to program and get a job in tech.
126320	129040	Hell, it would even be better off for these blue-collar workers,
129040	131760	according to the Journos, because coding was a white-collar job.
131760	134960	Your old skillset was made obsolete due to the changing of the times,
134960	136720	and you had to change too to keep up.
136720	140160	And with a bit of effort, you can even advance up the social strata
140160	143040	and make the shift from being a grubby coal miner or whatever,
143040	147840	and transform yourself into a respectable middle-class programmer with a useful skillset.
147840	148720	What could go wrong?
148720	153920	As it turns out, the skills of a shitty blogger who exclusively writes about male privilege,
153920	157680	while spending half of her workday melting down on Twitter about Trump,
157680	160640	is in even less demand than the skills of a coal miner.
160640	163520	So I guess it's time for the Journos to learn to code too.
163520	167040	Except, the Journos aren't reacting with the grace and civility
167040	169920	that they expected the coal miners to react with a few years ago.
169920	172800	I believe there is a special, dedicated section of hell
172800	177280	just for people with anime Twitter avatars who tell laid-off journalists to learn to code.
177280	178560	That might actually be true.
178560	182000	There is, after all, a dedicated section of hell for journalists
182000	184240	who tell coal miners to learn to code.
184240	186080	You're experiencing it right now.
186080	189520	If any other Journos targeted by layoffs are getting masses of
189520	193200	learn to code harassment, it was coordinated on 4chan, of course.
193200	195440	Imagine being such a privileged piece of shit
195440	198960	that you can afford to do a PhD in feminist dance therapy,
198960	202160	spend your prime professional years blogging about your vagina,
202160	205040	and then when it all inevitably comes crashing down on your head,
205040	209760	have the audacity to describe your shitcanning as being targeted like it's an attack,
209760	214080	and then when people spit your own disgustingly foul rhetoric back in your face,
214080	216320	describing it as coordinated harassment.
216320	219840	When all of you idiots conspired in whatever private chat you're all in
219840	223840	to tell coal miners to learn to code, was that coordinated harassment too?
223840	226320	Anyone telling journalists to learn to code today,
226320	228560	I have a piece of unsolicited advice for you.
228560	230240	Swan dive into Vesuvius.
230240	231760	Oh hey, it's Talia Lavin.
231760	234000	Didn't you hold a job as a fact-checker once?
234000	236960	And didn't you critically fail to fact-check one of your stories
236960	241440	and ultimately sic a mob of people on a disabled ice worker thinking he had a Nazi tattoo?
241440	244640	And, after being forced out of the New Yorker for your incompetence,
244640	246720	weren't you hired by Media Matters?
246720	250000	Because as it turns out, your qualifications or work experience
250000	252800	don't matter in your fucking industry, only your politics?
252800	256000	You are the exact type of fake news that everyone hates.
256000	258800	You're part of the reason people don't trust the media anymore.
258800	261520	Oh, there's calls to unionize in the face of all this.
261520	263440	Yeah, that'll save a dying industry.
263440	266960	Add in another layer of bureaucracy that a company has to sift through
266960	268480	in order to get work underway.
268480	270720	Maybe you should just learn to code instead.
270720	274000	Lord help me if I dare see one more Learn to Code tweet.
274000	278160	Oh, apparently you covered Islamophobia and Muslim civil rights issues at HuffPo.
278160	281520	How long until Learn to Code is an Islamophobic slur?
281520	285760	Apparently Breakaway noticed the trending meme and capitalized on the opportunity.
285760	290080	Their coding classes just went on sale, dropping from $100 to just $10.99.
290080	294640	If any of you indignant journos are listening in, it may be time to swallow your pride,
294640	299040	stop polishing your custom-made IRL Twitter verified badge, and sign up.
299040	303840	For those who are wondering, HuffPo's opinion, the entire section, is being eliminated.
303840	307920	The beautiful, diverse, inclusive baby we built from scratch is gone.
307920	312880	Well, I'm sorry Chloe and Gal, but when I look at HuffPo's opinion, I didn't see a baby.
312880	317840	I saw a cluster of cells that didn't yet qualify as its own unique life form,
317840	321680	and thankfully in the United States, abortion is still legal.
321680	326800	Here's a list of reactions to being laid off from a journalist position organized by Astrological
327280	331840	And through this, you can really see how all of these people are absolutely entitled hipster kids.
331840	335280	Taking down the company in a series of drunk tweets.
335280	336960	Getting high in the bath.
336960	338400	Drunk monologuing.
338400	341360	Getting on Tinder to line up free dinners.
341360	342880	Airing work grudges.
342880	344320	Distributing edibles.
344320	348560	Almost all of these answers scream a panicking cat lady in plaid,
348560	352560	failing to hold things together once reality finally pops their privilege bubble.
352560	357920	It should not be a badge of pride that, at 37, you don't know how to be an adult yet.
357920	362160	If your job, your school, or the world hasn't yet taught you these lessons,
362160	367280	you're most likely an emotionally stunted human being, far more than any anime twitter avatar.
367280	370240	And it's going to be a horror show when you're finally dragged,
370240	372080	kicking and screaming into the light.
372080	374720	This is all happening because it's funny and ironic, sure,
374720	378880	but the journalist aversion to the whole learn to code thing shows their true nature.
378880	381680	These people believe they're above learning to code.
381680	385600	Former factory workers and coal miners must learn to code, but not them.
385600	386800	That's below their station.
386800	388720	They have this hierarchy in their heads.
388720	390320	White middle americas at the bottom.
390320	394960	They do menial work until globalism destroys their lives and their town falls to ruin.
394960	396800	In order to even be considered human,
396800	400000	they need to follow the advice of a new male writing in LA
400000	402480	and learn to code to join the acceptable class.
402480	406080	A class full of imported brown people who all have programming experience
406080	408800	that middle america needs to compete with in a race to the bottom.
408800	412240	But of course, if they were to complain about this, they'd be considered racist.
412240	414720	And then there's the journalists at the top of the hierarchy.
414720	417200	They can't be expected to learn to code, of course,
417200	419920	because coding isn't a gentrified profession anymore.
419920	422080	Articles from five or ten years ago
422080	424800	trying to get women into tech through coding are no longer valid.
424800	427200	Programs trying to get women into computer science
427200	429920	have shifted from being liberating to sexist.
429920	435120	Before long, their own cries of learn to code will become an alt-right code word
435120	437120	designed to oppress journalists.
437120	439280	Because as I described in a previous video,
439280	442160	journalists see themselves as a protected class.
442160	443600	Remember the sins of the media
443600	446400	as you read all the testimonials floating around out there.
446400	448480	When you hear an anecdote about a BuzzFeed writer
448480	450480	complaining about how much therapy costs,
450480	452640	even though she wrote an article a few years back
452640	454800	talking about how racist Patreon is
454800	457040	for allowing YouTubers to get money from their fans,
457040	459280	remember that this is a bed they made themselves.
459280	463120	Remember that when a mentally challenged white kid was tortured by three black kids,
463120	466160	the media took the side of the black kids until the truth came out,
466160	467760	then quietly dropped the story.
467760	470320	Remember the media taking the side of Mattress Girl
470320	473760	and even doubling down as the evidence against her began to pile up.
473760	476240	Remember the media's treatment of the mega kids
476240	481120	and their still ongoing desperate scramble to try and pin something, anything, on them
481120	483600	now that Nathan Phillips has turned out to be a hoax.
483600	486640	Ultimately, these people should have never held jobs in the first place.
486640	488720	The market is finally course-correcting.
488720	490800	These companies could no longer continue to bear
490800	493680	the financial weight of their own ideological obsessions.
493680	495920	To put it plainly, reality is kicking in.
495920	499200	Radical lefty journalists have spent years using their platform
499200	503040	to target ordinary people that, by chance, happen to appear in their crosshairs.
503040	505520	Be the wrong race or gender at the wrong time.
505520	507040	Accidentally say the wrong thing.
507040	508560	Make the wrong facial expression.
508560	509840	Tell the wrong joke.
509840	511200	Vote for the wrong candidate.
511200	513600	And these people would see you financially crippled,
513600	515760	see you excommunicated from any workplaces,
515760	517760	societies, and friend groups you've cultivated,
517760	519360	and see your family ruined.
519360	521760	I don't want any of that for the laid-off journos.
522320	523760	I just want them to learn to code.
524560	525440	Hi, everybody.
525440	527840	While no one is born a computer scientist,
527840	530720	becoming a computer scientist isn't as scary as it sounds.
531520	534400	With hard work and a little math and science, anyone can do it.
534400	535920	Don't just consume things.
535920	536960	Create things.
536960	540640	Take an hour to learn more about the technology that touches every part of our lives.
541360	544800	That's how you can prepare yourself with the skills you need for your future.
545520	549360	And it's how you can help prepare our country for the future as well.
550320	553360	America has always been a nation of tinkerers and builders and inventors.
554000	558400	We brought the world everything from the light bulb and the telephone to the iPad and the Internet.
558400	562240	So whether you're a young man trying his hand at programming for the first time,
562240	564880	or a young woman who's already hard at work on the next big thing,
565520	569360	we're counting on you, America's young people, to keep us on the cutting edge.
570320	571440	Thanks, everybody.
571440	572800	And happy coding.
