00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
The phrase, learn to code, was briefly trending on Twitter yesterday,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,440
before Jack quietly but predictably suppressed the tag.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,400
It was in reference to BuzzFeed laying off dozens of journalists in its news division,

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,240
as the media outlet restructures.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,120
It's a slaughter, one employee who was not authorized to speak publicly told CNN Business.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,560
The entire national desk,

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,520
which produced some of BuzzFeed News's most illustrious feature reporting, was cut.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,600
The health desk was also slashed, and the national security desk was disbanded.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,520
The website's LGBT desk, an area of coverage in which BuzzFeed News

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,960
had invested significant resources, was left with only one staffer.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,200
The entertainment team also suffered some cuts.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,600
In total, 43 people were let go on Friday.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,000
Now you're not going to find me shedding a tear for these people.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,760
BuzzFeed is, as Donald Trump once put it, a flaming pile of garbage.

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,800
As far as BuzzFeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it,

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,760
I think they're going to suffer the consequences, they already are.

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,840
They routinely publish unverified or even undisputably false stories,

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,600
and wrap all of it in sensationalist click-baity low-quality writing.

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,000
They produce almost nothing of any actual merit.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,720
And they don't employ journalists, but ideological activists in journalist clothing.

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,920
Or at least they did, until they all got shown the door.

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,320
Other companies laid off people as well.

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,640
Gannet, Verizon, Oath, HuffPo.

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,120
As it turns out, ideological activism that the majority of the population, or hell,

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,880
the majority of your user base disagrees with, is not profitable.

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,120
This phenomenon is otherwise described by the catchy adage, get woke, go broke.

27
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,120
But where does the learn to code part come in?

28
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,600
Well, in the past, when the working class of Hinterland America suffered from layoffs,

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,480
firings, and factory closings, as the combination of globalist trade policies

30
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,080
shipping their jobs overseas,

31
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,520
and influxes of cheap labor into the market through mass migration

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,920
completely destroyed America's mining, manufacturing, and energy sectors,

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,880
these bourgeois upper-class journalists and bloggers sitting in their coastal elite offices

34
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,600
would write about how the working class should just learn to code.

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,160
Forget your old career, forget your old job market,

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,320
just learn to program and get a job in tech.

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,040
Hell, it would even be better off for these blue-collar workers,

38
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,760
according to the Journos, because coding was a white-collar job.

39
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,960
Your old skillset was made obsolete due to the changing of the times,

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,720
and you had to change too to keep up.

41
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,160
And with a bit of effort, you can even advance up the social strata

42
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,040
and make the shift from being a grubby coal miner or whatever,

43
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,840
and transform yourself into a respectable middle-class programmer with a useful skillset.

44
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,720
What could go wrong?

45
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,920
As it turns out, the skills of a shitty blogger who exclusively writes about male privilege,

46
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,680
while spending half of her workday melting down on Twitter about Trump,

47
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,640
is in even less demand than the skills of a coal miner.

48
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,520
So I guess it's time for the Journos to learn to code too.

49
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,040
Except, the Journos aren't reacting with the grace and civility

50
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,920
that they expected the coal miners to react with a few years ago.

51
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,800
I believe there is a special, dedicated section of hell

52
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,280
just for people with anime Twitter avatars who tell laid-off journalists to learn to code.

53
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,560
That might actually be true.

54
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,000
There is, after all, a dedicated section of hell for journalists

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,240
who tell coal miners to learn to code.

56
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,080
You're experiencing it right now.

57
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,520
If any other Journos targeted by layoffs are getting masses of

58
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,200
learn to code harassment, it was coordinated on 4chan, of course.

59
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,440
Imagine being such a privileged piece of shit

60
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,960
that you can afford to do a PhD in feminist dance therapy,

61
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,160
spend your prime professional years blogging about your vagina,

62
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,040
and then when it all inevitably comes crashing down on your head,

63
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,760
have the audacity to describe your shitcanning as being targeted like it's an attack,

64
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,080
and then when people spit your own disgustingly foul rhetoric back in your face,

65
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,320
describing it as coordinated harassment.

66
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,840
When all of you idiots conspired in whatever private chat you're all in

67
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,840
to tell coal miners to learn to code, was that coordinated harassment too?

68
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,320
Anyone telling journalists to learn to code today,

69
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,560
I have a piece of unsolicited advice for you.

70
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,240
Swan dive into Vesuvius.

71
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,760
Oh hey, it's Talia Lavin.

72
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,000
Didn't you hold a job as a fact-checker once?

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,960
And didn't you critically fail to fact-check one of your stories

74
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,440
and ultimately sic a mob of people on a disabled ice worker thinking he had a Nazi tattoo?

75
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,640
And, after being forced out of the New Yorker for your incompetence,

76
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,720
weren't you hired by Media Matters?

77
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,000
Because as it turns out, your qualifications or work experience

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,800
don't matter in your fucking industry, only your politics?

79
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,000
You are the exact type of fake news that everyone hates.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,800
You're part of the reason people don't trust the media anymore.

81
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,520
Oh, there's calls to unionize in the face of all this.

82
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,440
Yeah, that'll save a dying industry.

83
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,960
Add in another layer of bureaucracy that a company has to sift through

84
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,480
in order to get work underway.

85
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,720
Maybe you should just learn to code instead.

86
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,000
Lord help me if I dare see one more Learn to Code tweet.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,160
Oh, apparently you covered Islamophobia and Muslim civil rights issues at HuffPo.

88
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,520
How long until Learn to Code is an Islamophobic slur?

89
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,760
Apparently Breakaway noticed the trending meme and capitalized on the opportunity.

90
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,080
Their coding classes just went on sale, dropping from $100 to just $10.99.

91
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,640
If any of you indignant journos are listening in, it may be time to swallow your pride,

92
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,040
stop polishing your custom-made IRL Twitter verified badge, and sign up.

93
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,840
For those who are wondering, HuffPo's opinion, the entire section, is being eliminated.

94
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,920
The beautiful, diverse, inclusive baby we built from scratch is gone.

95
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,880
Well, I'm sorry Chloe and Gal, but when I look at HuffPo's opinion, I didn't see a baby.

96
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,840
I saw a cluster of cells that didn't yet qualify as its own unique life form,

97
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,680
and thankfully in the United States, abortion is still legal.

98
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,800
Here's a list of reactions to being laid off from a journalist position organized by Astrological

99
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,840
And through this, you can really see how all of these people are absolutely entitled hipster kids.

100
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,280
Taking down the company in a series of drunk tweets.

101
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,960
Getting high in the bath.

102
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,400
Drunk monologuing.

103
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,360
Getting on Tinder to line up free dinners.

104
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,880
Airing work grudges.

105
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,320
Distributing edibles.

106
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,560
Almost all of these answers scream a panicking cat lady in plaid,

107
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,560
failing to hold things together once reality finally pops their privilege bubble.

108
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,920
It should not be a badge of pride that, at 37, you don't know how to be an adult yet.

109
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,160
If your job, your school, or the world hasn't yet taught you these lessons,

110
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,280
you're most likely an emotionally stunted human being, far more than any anime twitter avatar.

111
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,240
And it's going to be a horror show when you're finally dragged,

112
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,080
kicking and screaming into the light.

113
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,720
This is all happening because it's funny and ironic, sure,

114
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,880
but the journalist aversion to the whole learn to code thing shows their true nature.

115
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,680
These people believe they're above learning to code.

116
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,600
Former factory workers and coal miners must learn to code, but not them.

117
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,800
That's below their station.

118
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,720
They have this hierarchy in their heads.

119
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,320
White middle americas at the bottom.

120
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,960
They do menial work until globalism destroys their lives and their town falls to ruin.

121
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,800
In order to even be considered human,

122
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,000
they need to follow the advice of a new male writing in LA

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,480
and learn to code to join the acceptable class.

124
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,080
A class full of imported brown people who all have programming experience

125
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,800
that middle america needs to compete with in a race to the bottom.

126
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,240
But of course, if they were to complain about this, they'd be considered racist.

127
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,720
And then there's the journalists at the top of the hierarchy.

128
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,200
They can't be expected to learn to code, of course,

129
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,920
because coding isn't a gentrified profession anymore.

130
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,080
Articles from five or ten years ago

131
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,800
trying to get women into tech through coding are no longer valid.

132
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,200
Programs trying to get women into computer science

133
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,920
have shifted from being liberating to sexist.

134
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,120
Before long, their own cries of learn to code will become an alt-right code word

135
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,120
designed to oppress journalists.

136
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,280
Because as I described in a previous video,

137
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,160
journalists see themselves as a protected class.

138
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,600
Remember the sins of the media

139
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,400
as you read all the testimonials floating around out there.

140
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,480
When you hear an anecdote about a BuzzFeed writer

141
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,480
complaining about how much therapy costs,

142
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,640
even though she wrote an article a few years back

143
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,800
talking about how racist Patreon is

144
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,040
for allowing YouTubers to get money from their fans,

145
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,280
remember that this is a bed they made themselves.

146
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,120
Remember that when a mentally challenged white kid was tortured by three black kids,

147
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,160
the media took the side of the black kids until the truth came out,

148
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,760
then quietly dropped the story.

149
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,320
Remember the media taking the side of Mattress Girl

150
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,760
and even doubling down as the evidence against her began to pile up.

151
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,240
Remember the media's treatment of the mega kids

152
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,120
and their still ongoing desperate scramble to try and pin something, anything, on them

153
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,600
now that Nathan Phillips has turned out to be a hoax.

154
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,640
Ultimately, these people should have never held jobs in the first place.

155
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,720
The market is finally course-correcting.

156
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,800
These companies could no longer continue to bear

157
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,680
the financial weight of their own ideological obsessions.

158
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,920
To put it plainly, reality is kicking in.

159
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,200
Radical lefty journalists have spent years using their platform

160
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,040
to target ordinary people that, by chance, happen to appear in their crosshairs.

161
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,520
Be the wrong race or gender at the wrong time.

162
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,040
Accidentally say the wrong thing.

163
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,560
Make the wrong facial expression.

164
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,840
Tell the wrong joke.

165
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,200
Vote for the wrong candidate.

166
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,600
And these people would see you financially crippled,

167
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,760
see you excommunicated from any workplaces,

168
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
societies, and friend groups you've cultivated,

169
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,360
and see your family ruined.

170
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,760
I don't want any of that for the laid-off journos.

171
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,760
I just want them to learn to code.

172
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,440
Hi, everybody.

173
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,840
While no one is born a computer scientist,

174
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,720
becoming a computer scientist isn't as scary as it sounds.

175
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,400
With hard work and a little math and science, anyone can do it.

176
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,920
Don't just consume things.

177
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,960
Create things.

178
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,640
Take an hour to learn more about the technology that touches every part of our lives.

179
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,800
That's how you can prepare yourself with the skills you need for your future.

180
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,360
And it's how you can help prepare our country for the future as well.

181
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,360
America has always been a nation of tinkerers and builders and inventors.

182
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,400
We brought the world everything from the light bulb and the telephone to the iPad and the Internet.

183
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,240
So whether you're a young man trying his hand at programming for the first time,

184
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,880
or a young woman who's already hard at work on the next big thing,

185
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,360
we're counting on you, America's young people, to keep us on the cutting edge.

186
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,440
Thanks, everybody.

187
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,800
And happy coding.
