00:00.000 --> 00:03.920
The phrase, learn to code, was briefly trending on Twitter yesterday,

00:03.920 --> 00:07.440
before Jack quietly but predictably suppressed the tag.

00:07.440 --> 00:12.400
It was in reference to BuzzFeed laying off dozens of journalists in its news division,

00:12.400 --> 00:14.240
as the media outlet restructures.

00:14.240 --> 00:19.120
It's a slaughter, one employee who was not authorized to speak publicly told CNN Business.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.560
The entire national desk,

00:20.560 --> 00:25.520
which produced some of BuzzFeed News's most illustrious feature reporting, was cut.

00:25.520 --> 00:29.600
The health desk was also slashed, and the national security desk was disbanded.

00:29.600 --> 00:33.520
The website's LGBT desk, an area of coverage in which BuzzFeed News

00:33.520 --> 00:36.960
had invested significant resources, was left with only one staffer.

00:36.960 --> 00:39.200
The entertainment team also suffered some cuts.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.600
In total, 43 people were let go on Friday.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.000
Now you're not going to find me shedding a tear for these people.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.760
BuzzFeed is, as Donald Trump once put it, a flaming pile of garbage.

00:48.320 --> 00:54.800
As far as BuzzFeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it,

00:54.800 --> 00:57.760
I think they're going to suffer the consequences, they already are.

00:57.760 --> 01:01.840
They routinely publish unverified or even undisputably false stories,

01:01.840 --> 01:05.600
and wrap all of it in sensationalist click-baity low-quality writing.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.000
They produce almost nothing of any actual merit.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.720
And they don't employ journalists, but ideological activists in journalist clothing.

01:12.720 --> 01:15.920
Or at least they did, until they all got shown the door.

01:15.920 --> 01:18.320
Other companies laid off people as well.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.640
Gannet, Verizon, Oath, HuffPo.

01:20.640 --> 01:25.120
As it turns out, ideological activism that the majority of the population, or hell,

01:25.120 --> 01:28.880
the majority of your user base disagrees with, is not profitable.

01:28.880 --> 01:33.120
This phenomenon is otherwise described by the catchy adage, get woke, go broke.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.120
But where does the learn to code part come in?

01:35.120 --> 01:39.600
Well, in the past, when the working class of Hinterland America suffered from layoffs,

01:39.600 --> 01:44.480
firings, and factory closings, as the combination of globalist trade policies

01:44.480 --> 01:46.080
shipping their jobs overseas,

01:46.080 --> 01:49.520
and influxes of cheap labor into the market through mass migration

01:49.520 --> 01:53.920
completely destroyed America's mining, manufacturing, and energy sectors,

01:53.920 --> 01:58.880
these bourgeois upper-class journalists and bloggers sitting in their coastal elite offices

01:58.880 --> 02:01.600
would write about how the working class should just learn to code.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.160
Forget your old career, forget your old job market,

02:04.160 --> 02:06.320
just learn to program and get a job in tech.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.040
Hell, it would even be better off for these blue-collar workers,

02:09.040 --> 02:11.760
according to the Journos, because coding was a white-collar job.

02:11.760 --> 02:14.960
Your old skillset was made obsolete due to the changing of the times,

02:14.960 --> 02:16.720
and you had to change too to keep up.

02:16.720 --> 02:20.160
And with a bit of effort, you can even advance up the social strata

02:20.160 --> 02:23.040
and make the shift from being a grubby coal miner or whatever,

02:23.040 --> 02:27.840
and transform yourself into a respectable middle-class programmer with a useful skillset.

02:27.840 --> 02:28.720
What could go wrong?

02:28.720 --> 02:33.920
As it turns out, the skills of a shitty blogger who exclusively writes about male privilege,

02:33.920 --> 02:37.680
while spending half of her workday melting down on Twitter about Trump,

02:37.680 --> 02:40.640
is in even less demand than the skills of a coal miner.

02:40.640 --> 02:43.520
So I guess it's time for the Journos to learn to code too.

02:43.520 --> 02:47.040
Except, the Journos aren't reacting with the grace and civility

02:47.040 --> 02:49.920
that they expected the coal miners to react with a few years ago.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.800
I believe there is a special, dedicated section of hell

02:52.800 --> 02:57.280
just for people with anime Twitter avatars who tell laid-off journalists to learn to code.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.560
That might actually be true.

02:58.560 --> 03:02.000
There is, after all, a dedicated section of hell for journalists

03:02.000 --> 03:04.240
who tell coal miners to learn to code.

03:04.240 --> 03:06.080
You're experiencing it right now.

03:06.080 --> 03:09.520
If any other Journos targeted by layoffs are getting masses of

03:09.520 --> 03:13.200
learn to code harassment, it was coordinated on 4chan, of course.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.440
Imagine being such a privileged piece of shit

03:15.440 --> 03:18.960
that you can afford to do a PhD in feminist dance therapy,

03:18.960 --> 03:22.160
spend your prime professional years blogging about your vagina,

03:22.160 --> 03:25.040
and then when it all inevitably comes crashing down on your head,

03:25.040 --> 03:29.760
have the audacity to describe your shitcanning as being targeted like it's an attack,

03:29.760 --> 03:34.080
and then when people spit your own disgustingly foul rhetoric back in your face,

03:34.080 --> 03:36.320
describing it as coordinated harassment.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.840
When all of you idiots conspired in whatever private chat you're all in

03:39.840 --> 03:43.840
to tell coal miners to learn to code, was that coordinated harassment too?

03:43.840 --> 03:46.320
Anyone telling journalists to learn to code today,

03:46.320 --> 03:48.560
I have a piece of unsolicited advice for you.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.240
Swan dive into Vesuvius.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.760
Oh hey, it's Talia Lavin.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.000
Didn't you hold a job as a fact-checker once?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.960
And didn't you critically fail to fact-check one of your stories

03:56.960 --> 04:01.440
and ultimately sic a mob of people on a disabled ice worker thinking he had a Nazi tattoo?

04:01.440 --> 04:04.640
And, after being forced out of the New Yorker for your incompetence,

04:04.640 --> 04:06.720
weren't you hired by Media Matters?

04:06.720 --> 04:10.000
Because as it turns out, your qualifications or work experience

04:10.000 --> 04:12.800
don't matter in your fucking industry, only your politics?

04:12.800 --> 04:16.000
You are the exact type of fake news that everyone hates.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.800
You're part of the reason people don't trust the media anymore.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.520
Oh, there's calls to unionize in the face of all this.

04:21.520 --> 04:23.440
Yeah, that'll save a dying industry.

04:23.440 --> 04:26.960
Add in another layer of bureaucracy that a company has to sift through

04:26.960 --> 04:28.480
in order to get work underway.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.720
Maybe you should just learn to code instead.

04:30.720 --> 04:34.000
Lord help me if I dare see one more Learn to Code tweet.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.160
Oh, apparently you covered Islamophobia and Muslim civil rights issues at HuffPo.

04:38.160 --> 04:41.520
How long until Learn to Code is an Islamophobic slur?

04:41.520 --> 04:45.760
Apparently Breakaway noticed the trending meme and capitalized on the opportunity.

04:45.760 --> 04:50.080
Their coding classes just went on sale, dropping from $100 to just $10.99.

04:50.080 --> 04:54.640
If any of you indignant journos are listening in, it may be time to swallow your pride,

04:54.640 --> 04:59.040
stop polishing your custom-made IRL Twitter verified badge, and sign up.

04:59.040 --> 05:03.840
For those who are wondering, HuffPo's opinion, the entire section, is being eliminated.

05:03.840 --> 05:07.920
The beautiful, diverse, inclusive baby we built from scratch is gone.

05:07.920 --> 05:12.880
Well, I'm sorry Chloe and Gal, but when I look at HuffPo's opinion, I didn't see a baby.

05:12.880 --> 05:17.840
I saw a cluster of cells that didn't yet qualify as its own unique life form,

05:17.840 --> 05:21.680
and thankfully in the United States, abortion is still legal.

05:21.680 --> 05:26.800
Here's a list of reactions to being laid off from a journalist position organized by Astrological

05:27.280 --> 05:31.840
And through this, you can really see how all of these people are absolutely entitled hipster kids.

05:31.840 --> 05:35.280
Taking down the company in a series of drunk tweets.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.960
Getting high in the bath.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.400
Drunk monologuing.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.360
Getting on Tinder to line up free dinners.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.880
Airing work grudges.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.320
Distributing edibles.

05:44.320 --> 05:48.560
Almost all of these answers scream a panicking cat lady in plaid,

05:48.560 --> 05:52.560
failing to hold things together once reality finally pops their privilege bubble.

05:52.560 --> 05:57.920
It should not be a badge of pride that, at 37, you don't know how to be an adult yet.

05:57.920 --> 06:02.160
If your job, your school, or the world hasn't yet taught you these lessons,

06:02.160 --> 06:07.280
you're most likely an emotionally stunted human being, far more than any anime twitter avatar.

06:07.280 --> 06:10.240
And it's going to be a horror show when you're finally dragged,

06:10.240 --> 06:12.080
kicking and screaming into the light.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.720
This is all happening because it's funny and ironic, sure,

06:14.720 --> 06:18.880
but the journalist aversion to the whole learn to code thing shows their true nature.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.680
These people believe they're above learning to code.

06:21.680 --> 06:25.600
Former factory workers and coal miners must learn to code, but not them.

06:25.600 --> 06:26.800
That's below their station.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.720
They have this hierarchy in their heads.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.320
White middle americas at the bottom.

06:30.320 --> 06:34.960
They do menial work until globalism destroys their lives and their town falls to ruin.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.800
In order to even be considered human,

06:36.800 --> 06:40.000
they need to follow the advice of a new male writing in LA

06:40.000 --> 06:42.480
and learn to code to join the acceptable class.

06:42.480 --> 06:46.080
A class full of imported brown people who all have programming experience

06:46.080 --> 06:48.800
that middle america needs to compete with in a race to the bottom.

06:48.800 --> 06:52.240
But of course, if they were to complain about this, they'd be considered racist.

06:52.240 --> 06:54.720
And then there's the journalists at the top of the hierarchy.

06:54.720 --> 06:57.200
They can't be expected to learn to code, of course,

06:57.200 --> 06:59.920
because coding isn't a gentrified profession anymore.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.080
Articles from five or ten years ago

07:02.080 --> 07:04.800
trying to get women into tech through coding are no longer valid.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.200
Programs trying to get women into computer science

07:07.200 --> 07:09.920
have shifted from being liberating to sexist.

07:09.920 --> 07:15.120
Before long, their own cries of learn to code will become an alt-right code word

07:15.120 --> 07:17.120
designed to oppress journalists.

07:17.120 --> 07:19.280
Because as I described in a previous video,

07:19.280 --> 07:22.160
journalists see themselves as a protected class.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.600
Remember the sins of the media

07:23.600 --> 07:26.400
as you read all the testimonials floating around out there.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.480
When you hear an anecdote about a BuzzFeed writer

07:28.480 --> 07:30.480
complaining about how much therapy costs,

07:30.480 --> 07:32.640
even though she wrote an article a few years back

07:32.640 --> 07:34.800
talking about how racist Patreon is

07:34.800 --> 07:37.040
for allowing YouTubers to get money from their fans,

07:37.040 --> 07:39.280
remember that this is a bed they made themselves.

07:39.280 --> 07:43.120
Remember that when a mentally challenged white kid was tortured by three black kids,

07:43.120 --> 07:46.160
the media took the side of the black kids until the truth came out,

07:46.160 --> 07:47.760
then quietly dropped the story.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.320
Remember the media taking the side of Mattress Girl

07:50.320 --> 07:53.760
and even doubling down as the evidence against her began to pile up.

07:53.760 --> 07:56.240
Remember the media's treatment of the mega kids

07:56.240 --> 08:01.120
and their still ongoing desperate scramble to try and pin something, anything, on them

08:01.120 --> 08:03.600
now that Nathan Phillips has turned out to be a hoax.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.640
Ultimately, these people should have never held jobs in the first place.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.720
The market is finally course-correcting.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.800
These companies could no longer continue to bear

08:10.800 --> 08:13.680
the financial weight of their own ideological obsessions.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.920
To put it plainly, reality is kicking in.

08:15.920 --> 08:19.200
Radical lefty journalists have spent years using their platform

08:19.200 --> 08:23.040
to target ordinary people that, by chance, happen to appear in their crosshairs.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.520
Be the wrong race or gender at the wrong time.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.040
Accidentally say the wrong thing.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.560
Make the wrong facial expression.

08:28.560 --> 08:29.840
Tell the wrong joke.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.200
Vote for the wrong candidate.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.600
And these people would see you financially crippled,

08:33.600 --> 08:35.760
see you excommunicated from any workplaces,

08:35.760 --> 08:37.760
societies, and friend groups you've cultivated,

08:37.760 --> 08:39.360
and see your family ruined.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.760
I don't want any of that for the laid-off journos.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.760
I just want them to learn to code.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.440
Hi, everybody.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.840
While no one is born a computer scientist,

08:47.840 --> 08:50.720
becoming a computer scientist isn't as scary as it sounds.

08:51.520 --> 08:54.400
With hard work and a little math and science, anyone can do it.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.920
Don't just consume things.

08:55.920 --> 08:56.960
Create things.

08:56.960 --> 09:00.640
Take an hour to learn more about the technology that touches every part of our lives.

09:01.360 --> 09:04.800
That's how you can prepare yourself with the skills you need for your future.

09:05.520 --> 09:09.360
And it's how you can help prepare our country for the future as well.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.360
America has always been a nation of tinkerers and builders and inventors.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.400
We brought the world everything from the light bulb and the telephone to the iPad and the Internet.

09:18.400 --> 09:22.240
So whether you're a young man trying his hand at programming for the first time,

09:22.240 --> 09:24.880
or a young woman who's already hard at work on the next big thing,

09:25.520 --> 09:29.360
we're counting on you, America's young people, to keep us on the cutting edge.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.440
Thanks, everybody.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.800
And happy coding.
