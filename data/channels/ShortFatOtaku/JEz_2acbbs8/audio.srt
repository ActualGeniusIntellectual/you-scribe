00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
Hello and welcome back to SJ Weekly and welcome back to the channel, I'm back guys!

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,380
It is very good to see all of you here again, a special thanks to The Britisher for letting

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,160
me do the show on his channel while I was gone, and a very special thanks to all of

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,780
you guys, either in the comments sections or on Twitter, who tried to get me back on

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:25,120
YouTube, who rooted for me, and who welcomed me back yesterday during my 18 second I'm

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,120
Back video.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,200
And I must be doing something right, because there are a lot of the angry usual suspects

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,380
in my Twitter mentions right now, so we're on the right track guys.

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,800
During the two week vacation, one of the things I did was I went home and visited my parents,

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:46,160
we did an early Christmas, and one of the gifts that I got was a set of cold brew coffees,

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,920
different brews, so I guess I'll be drinking those for a while.

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,720
What a cold brew coffee is, if you don't know, is they take the coffee grounds, put it in

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,920
cold water, and they just let it sit there for like a day, and let it kind of cold brew

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,680
up, and then they drain the grounds out, and then you have coffee.

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:11,480
So this is the hazelnut coffee, let's give it a shot.

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,900
It's a bit stronger than regular hazelnut coffee it seems.

17
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,920
I've heated it up so it's still like a regular cup of coffee, it's a bit stronger, the hazelnut

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
comes through a bit more.

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,000
It's not bad though, I don't know if I drink it every day, but it's pretty good.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,700
Let's begin this week with Muslim Amazon workers say they don't have enough time to pray, now

21
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,800
they're fighting for their rights.

22
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,920
East African immigrant workers in Minneapolis are rallying for fair treatment, whoever wins

23
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,760
we lose I guess.

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:46,320
You know you're in Minneapolis right, holding a sign in your native language probably won't

25
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,760
help that much.

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,180
Somali community members in Minneapolis rallied against Amazon in July 2018 for allegedly

27
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,960
firing a Muslim worker who slowed down during Ramadan.

28
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,800
See this is what I mean when I say whoever wins we lose, because Amazon is legitimately

29
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,840
a shitty company, they really mistreat their workers.

30
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:11,480
However I don't like the idea of special rights being carved out for small subsections of

31
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,680
the population and only them.

32
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,800
As a practicing Muslim, Ebrahim tries to pray five times a day.

33
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,540
But because Amazon has the warehouse associates working on a strict hourly packing quota,

34
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,400
she says she cannot take a prayer break.

35
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,160
Well, keep in mind that the Quran not only says to pray five times a day, but that women

36
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,520
can't work outside of the house.

37
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,020
So what are you doing working at Amazon?

38
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,660
Associates are pressured to make rate, with the rate number increasing and decreasing

39
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,600
depending on the season's demand.

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,040
The warehouse's current packing rate is 240 boxes an hour, Ebrahim says, but it's gone

41
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,980
as high as 400.

42
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,520
Associates are penalized if they fall behind this rate, they can get a write up from a

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,540
manager if they're too slow, which can lead them to being terminated.

44
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,640
And this is what I mean by being a shit job, sometimes, for literally peanuts, companies

45
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,880
expect the world out of their employees, Walmart's another egregious example of this.

46
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,520
Ebrahim usually chooses to pray during her timed breaks.

47
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,640
Breaks make our rates slow down, and we get the risk of getting fired, and so most of

48
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,500
the time we choose prayer over bathroom, and have learned to balance our bodily needs.

49
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,380
And that's another piece of bullshit, yeah, you should be able to go to the washroom whenever

50
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,800
you have to go, like, sometimes these companies are just ridiculous.

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,400
Ebrahim, who works a 12 hour night shift from 5.30pm to 6am, says she's worked about 20

52
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,240
different jobs since moving to the US as a 16 year old in 2004.

53
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,320
Those jobs include working a fishing boat in the middle of the ocean off the coast of

54
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,400
Alaska, cleaning Chicago's O'Hare airport, and packing at a Target warehouse.

55
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,840
Her current job at Amazon, she says, has been her hardest.

56
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,680
I understand that Amazon can be pretty shit, and I'm not necessarily saying that it's not

57
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,920
hard, but I have a hard time believing that working on a fishing boat isn't harder.

58
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,460
Like fishermen, they do some pretty rough jobs man, and I gotta say, if this is so terrible

59
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,360
why don't you switch jobs again?

60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,700
You're obviously okay with switching jobs, I mean, you've done it many times, 20 different

61
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,980
jobs in the past, what is that, 14 years, 15 years?

62
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,360
With that many job switches, maybe the problem is that you can't hold a job down.

63
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,420
And she says, I want to keep this job to provide for my family, and I'm also working as hard

64
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,500
as I can, but you can't live under this type of pressure.

65
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,140
The way Amazon pushes people is not moral.

66
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:32,700
In a statement to Vox, an Amazon spokesperson touted the facility's excellent pay and comprehensive

67
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,700
benefits.

68
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,120
Well, I mean, maybe the facility does have excellent pay and comprehensive benefits,

69
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,840
and that's why they push people.

70
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,040
Maybe the facility doesn't have that, and therefore Amazon is just complete shit.

71
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,960
But nonetheless, if you're a Muslim woman, again, why are you providing for your family?

72
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,560
That's not within the tenets of your religion.

73
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,800
Ibrahim says the workers are asking to be treated humanely, calling on Amazon to display

74
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,560
racial and cultural sensitivity.

75
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,180
Those are two different things.

76
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,880
To be treated humanely is one thing, yes.

77
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,160
Fair pay for fair work.

78
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,480
Don't overwork people into the fucking grave.

79
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,400
Provide reasonable breaks.

80
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,280
But racial and cultural sensitivity is outside of that.

81
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,960
That's something different entirely.

82
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Because you don't have time to pray five times a day, that's not based on your race or ethnicity.

83
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,640
It is based on your religion, but the problem would be your religion, not necessarily the

84
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,640
workplace.

85
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,880
Amazon made changes that mainly dealt with issues around practicing Islam, oh boy.

86
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,240
Muslim Amazon workers had no place to pray in the warehouse, and they complained about

87
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,880
not being able to keep up with the job during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, where they

88
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,200
fast until sundown.

89
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Well, is there a church inside an Amazon warehouse?

90
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,360
Do they provide that shit too?

91
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,480
Amazon responded by creating a dedicated prayer space, I'm sure, and said it has been working

92
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,500
to make shifts more manageable during Ramadan.

93
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,420
But employees complain that these moves are like band-aids that address small issues

94
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,180
without tackling the larger problems.

95
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,300
What do you mean?

96
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,180
In my opinion, these are ridiculous things to do, but they directly address the problem.

97
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,980
What more could you want than this?

98
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:17,260
They give you a dedicated prayer room, and then they ease up on your quotas during Ramadan.

99
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,080
That's literally what you asked for.

100
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,380
During Ramadan, employees have the right to use PTO, personal time off, unpaid time off,

101
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,500
or vacation time if they have time available in their account.

102
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,820
They have to use those banked time allotments for religious holidays, giving them less time

103
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,580
than their non-Muslim co-workers to take off for when their kids are sick.

104
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,660
You don't think that Christians take time off sometimes.

105
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,980
You don't think there might be a Christian working for Amazon who takes Sundays off to

106
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,980
go to church?

107
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,540
You don't think there might be a Christian who works for Amazon who takes time around

108
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,260
Christmas and Easter off?

109
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,480
Unless you're comparing yourself to atheists, in which case you have a point, but that is

110
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,580
what you choose when you follow a religion.

111
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,520
If you want time set aside, you have to have time set aside, and it is entirely fair that

112
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,760
you have an equal amount of time set aside, you're just choosing to use it for religious

113
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,880
purposes.

114
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,880
Amazon said, we work hard every day to ensure all of our employees are treated fairly and

115
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,080
with dignity and respect, including here in Minnesota, where we have an open and direct

116
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,960
dialogue with employees.

117
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,480
Amazon offers a great employment opportunity with excellent pay, ranging from $16.25 an

118
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:28,920
hour to $20.80 an hour, and comprehensive benefits including healthcare, up to 20 weeks

119
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,840
parental leave, paid education, promotional opportunities, and more.

120
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,020
We encourage anyone to compare our pay, benefits, and workplace to other retailers and major

121
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,320
employers in the community and across the country.

122
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,040
We invite anyone to see for themselves and take a tour through our fulfillment center

123
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
tour program.

124
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
Well, there you go.

125
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,440
I mean, that's not super amazing pay, but it's certainly better than average.

126
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,820
And it's just for packing boxes.

127
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,520
Regarding its prayer breaks, Amazon told the author of this article that prayer breaks

128
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,560
less than 20 minutes are paid and productivity expectations are not adjusted for such breaks.

129
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,120
Associates are welcome to request an unpaid prayer break for over 20 minutes, for which

130
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,840
productivity expectations would be adjusted.

131
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,840
That sounds fair.

132
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,800
There's obviously the possibility that Amazon might be lying here, but if they're not, they

133
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,600
seem like they're doing an alright job already.

134
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,280
Ibrahim also says that until recently, nearly all Amazon managers in the warehouse were

135
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,640
white, which contributed to the culture gap many African workers perceive in the facility.

136
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
Oh, okay.

137
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,560
Everything up until now has mentioned Islam, but now suddenly we're talking about white

138
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
people.

139
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,560
It's gone from religion to race.

140
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,360
I don't want to sound like an Amazon apologist here because I know that there's actually

141
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:49,080
a lot wrong with Amazon, but I think this, this racial religious hodgepodge complaint

142
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,080
is not the place to go with these protests.

143
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:57,080
But speaking of religion, God wrongfully impregnated teenage Virgin Mary without consent, says

144
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,600
Minnesota professor.

145
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Um, he's, he's not wrong, I guess.

146
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:11,080
Virgin birth story is unethical abuse of power at best and grossly predatory at worst.

147
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,400
A Minnesota state university professor tweeted this week that Mary, the Virgin could not

148
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,820
have consented the conception of Christ and that God was behaving therefore in a quote

149
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,480
predatory manner.

150
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,520
That professor whose salary is paid for by taxpayers also tweeted himself decorating

151
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,720
a Christmas tree with satanic ornaments.

152
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,560
Have you taken any of his classes, Mark Stein?

153
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
No.

154
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,020
And the reason is this is the thing that this is because 50 years ago, this kind of shallow

155
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,260
banality would have been the province of a drunk undergraduate at three in the morning.

156
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:50,860
Um, I mean, basically the idea that, that God, uh, has gotten the Virgin Mary back to

157
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,040
his pad and she's saying, I really must go.

158
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,060
And he's saying, Oh baby, it's cold outside and put some records on while I pour.

159
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:07,420
I miss the days when atheists were at least intelligent enough to take seriously what

160
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,220
they were porting to knock down.

161
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,860
I mean, I don't really care about the satanic ornaments on your tree.

162
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,860
Do whatever you want.

163
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,780
But this is really stupid, isn't it?

164
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,920
This professor wrote the Virgin birth story is about an all knowing all powerful deity

165
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,460
impregnating a human teen.

166
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,620
Was was Mary a teen?

167
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,420
I mean, she might've been, it was, it was the ancient times, right?

168
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,720
But whatever.

169
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,260
There was no definition of consent that would include that scenario.

170
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,260
Happy holidays.

171
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,140
He later added the biblical God regularly punished disobedience, the power difference

172
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,460
deity versus mortal and the potential for violence for saying no negates her yes to

173
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,980
put someone in this position isn't an ethical abuse of power at best and grossly predatory

174
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,980
at worst.

175
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,020
The problem is not necessarily with what he's saying because I guess factually, if we're

176
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,260
going just strictly with what he said, he's correct.

177
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:59,060
However, what he's missing is that you cannot judge yesterday by today's morals.

178
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:04,260
There are various figures who lived throughout human history that by today's standards would

179
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,140
be considered immoral people, certainly, but by their own standards, they were paragons

180
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,140
of virtue.

181
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:16,820
And that's because just like any other form of, of advancement, whether it's, it's technological

182
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:24,740
or artistic advances in politics and philosophy also take time and you can't really judge

183
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,620
somebody living in the past for not living up to today's standards.

184
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,700
They had no concept of, of liberalism.

185
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,980
Some of them, if you go back far enough, there were no concept of universal human rights.

186
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,920
So to take a religious tale that was set in an era 2000 years ago and judge it by today's

187
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,140
morality is, is just stupidity.

188
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,600
However, there is a, there's a link in the middle of this article that says Nebraska

189
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,380
principle bans candy canes because the shape is a J for Jesus.

190
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,660
Let's see what that's all about.

191
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:57,780
The J shape stands for Jesus according to the blaze, but that was just for starters.

192
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,700
Also on the naughty list were Christmas carols, Christmas music, and making Christmas ornaments

193
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,700
as gifts.

194
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,500
You know, you know, I never really liked candy canes.

195
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,420
There are like strawberry flavored ones that are pretty okay, but the normal ones are just

196
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,420
eh.

197
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,300
A Nebraska elementary school principal named Jennifer Sinclair gave out this list of things

198
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,700
that were not allowed at Manchester elementary school in Omaha.

199
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:27,660
Santas or Christmas items on worksheets, Christmas trees in the classrooms, elf on the shelf,

200
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,580
bringing Christmas carols, playing Christmas music, sending a scholastic book that is a

201
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,660
Christmas book, making a Christmas ornament as a gift.

202
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,660
Candy canes.

203
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,800
Historically, the shape is a J for Jesus.

204
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,200
The red is for the blood of Christ and the white is a symbol of his resurrection.

205
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,540
Is that, is that actually what a candy cane is all about?

206
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,980
I don't know.

207
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,980
Red and green items.

208
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,500
So nothing red and green.

209
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,900
Those are just off-limits colors, reindeer, Christmas videos, movies, or characters from

210
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,900
Christmas movies.

211
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,260
Just no Christmas.

212
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,260
It's gone.

213
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:03,340
Sinclair, who's in her first year as Manchester's principal noted in the memo that she comes

214
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,580
from a place that Christmas and the like are not allowed in schools and that as a public

215
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:12,300
school, Manchester elementary will seek to be inclusive and culturally sensitive to all

216
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,420
of our students.

217
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,420
Make sure those students know to celebrate their generic winter holiday.

218
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:23,020
And actually I think her, her list of acceptable practices kind of reinforced that idea.

219
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,020
Gifts are okay.

220
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,660
Making gifts are okay.

221
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,580
Snow men, snow women, snow people, snowflakes.

222
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,060
I'm pretty sure the principal is a fucking snowflake.

223
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,380
Gingerbread people, not gingerbread men, according to the, what was it?

224
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,800
Was it Scotland that recently outlawed gingerbread men in favor of gingerbread people?

225
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,220
Holidays around the world, except not Christmas, apparently.

226
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,980
I know that, you know, Christmas is celebrated around the world.

227
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,460
There are Christians around the world, but I guess they don't count.

228
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,460
Sledding is good.

229
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:01,740
Hot chocolate, polar bears, penguins, scarves, boots, earmuffs, wait, wait, hold on.

230
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,740
Penguins.

231
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,860
They're in the South pole, not the North.

232
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,980
Scarves, boots, earmuffs, and hats.

233
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,180
You don't want them to freeze.

234
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,020
Can't ban those or else the kids will start dying.

235
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:16,660
Yetis and Olaf from Frozen.

236
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,800
It does seem like sanity has prevailed though, because Liberty council sent a demand letter

237
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,480
to the superintendent about the Christmas ban, urging it to be immediately overruled

238
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,720
and specifically disavowed the sweeping directive banning Christmas holiday items.

239
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,560
And the district's response to Liberty council said that it had investigated the matter and

240
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,200
determined that principal Sinclair's memorandum did not comply with board policy.

241
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,360
And the update shows that the principal has issued an apology, so I guess all's right

242
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
in the world.

243
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,800
You know, I'm not even a Christian, right?

244
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,920
But I cannot deny the cultural significance that Christmas has in western society.

245
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,320
I'm not even talking about the religious significance, and I'm sure for religious people there is

246
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,560
a great religious significance, but for non-religious people to simply celebrate Christmas as a

247
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,440
secular holiday, that shouldn't be taken away from them.

248
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,300
Western nations do have a culture all to their own, just like every other nation does, and

249
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,940
we should not be ashamed of it.

250
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,180
We certainly shouldn't think that ours is somehow superior to others, but we shouldn't

251
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,420
be okay with it simply being washed away in the name of political correctness.

252
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,000
Here's some more school nonsense from our old friends over at Breitbart.

253
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,380
Germany launches how to identify Nazi parents guide for schools.

254
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:36,420
I can see Germany doing this honestly, they're very Nazi-phobic and frankly I don't blame

255
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,060
them considering what happened.

256
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:45,620
However, a new booklet for daycare workers that claims to help identify Nazi parents

257
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,420
suggests looking out for girls with braided hair and athletic boys.

258
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:55,740
It's all it takes to be a Nazi nowadays, guys.

259
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,660
If your little girl has her hair braided, her parents are a Nazi, and she's being raised

260
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,740
to be a Nazi.

261
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:07,700
If the little boy is athletic, if he likes to run around or play a sport at school, Nazi.

262
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:13,020
People have labeled this booklet that's been handed out as parenting espionage or spying

263
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,800
on parents, and the booklet has been criticized because it identifies the way children dress

264
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,920
or how much physical activity they participate in as being potential signs that their parents

265
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
might be Nazis.

266
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,780
The criticism of that does not fit into democracy.

267
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,740
It very clearly does not fit in with fucking democracy.

268
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:34,260
You can't say, unless they're wearing an actual Nazi uniform, and even then there are reasons

269
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:40,700
to wear actual Nazi uniforms that don't make you a Nazi, believe it or not, but like how

270
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:47,780
people dress and how much physical activity they participate in, really, that's what makes

271
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,780
you a Nazi.

272
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,780
You're going to be a weightlifter.

273
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,780
You're a Nazi.

274
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,780
You're going to be a professional sports star.

275
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,780
You're a Nazi.

276
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,320
The foundation that put out these booklets defended it by claiming that the case studies

277
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,220
were based on real life cases they had witnessed, including a girl with braided hair whose parents

278
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,420
turned out to be far-right extremists.

279
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,580
This does not mean that all girls with braided hair are going to have parents that are far-right

280
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,320
extremists.

281
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,560
This is some D&D causes satanic panic shit, all right?

282
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:20,620
This is some video games cause school shooters gamers rise up bottom text actually shit.

283
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:25,320
The case studies echo research presented by Antifa groups in 2016, which claimed that

284
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:30,700
Volkstfamilies, those who believe in countryside living and traditional German culture and

285
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,500
values, posed a threat to Germany.

286
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,260
Anti-fascist action group member Olof Meyer warned of young couples who buy farms and

287
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,900
restore them together with their relatives and friends.

288
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,740
Yeah, this.

289
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,300
This is Nazism, guys.

290
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,300
This is it.

291
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,400
You know, you buy a fixer-upper?

292
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,460
You want to have kids?

293
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,460
You're a fucking Nazi.

294
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,220
Why aren't you participating in the absolute demographic destruction of the native German

295
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,900
population?

296
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,180
Is it because you're a Nazi?

297
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,660
This is so fucking stupid.

298
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,940
Let's learn the politically acceptable way to manipulate your children, according to

299
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,020
the Washington Post anyway.

300
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,060
Parents should encourage girls to get angry and show it.

301
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,060
Here's how.

302
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,580
We are so busy teaching girls to be likable that we forget to teach them that they have

303
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,100
the right to be respected, and the effects of that carry into adulthood.

304
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,700
Women and men experience anger the same way, but men are much more likely to express that

305
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,780
anger verbally, while women tend to keep it to themselves.

306
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,980
In doing so, we lose our ability to defend ourselves.

307
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,580
See, I'm not sure this is the truth.

308
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:35,660
I remember reading a different study where when adult men are angry, they're more likely

309
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:41,820
to express it physically, while when adult women are angry, they're more likely to express

310
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,740
it verbally.

311
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,860
They don't yell at people necessarily, though they do that sometimes, and they do get physical

312
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:53,500
sometimes too, but overwhelmingly women tend to spread rumors, they tend to slander, and

313
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,940
they tend to defame people.

314
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:04,040
There is a gendered component to how boys and girls, and men and women, let off steam

315
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
in this way.

316
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,020
Well, this author is committed to changing that in her home with her girls, ages six

317
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,020
and eleven.

318
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,980
Here's her six-point plan.

319
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,460
Oh boy.

320
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,340
One, share the positive power of anger.

321
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:22,000
Saying I am angry is a necessary first step to listen, believe me, listen and believe,

322
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,620
trust me, I know.

323
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,300
Time to do something, writes the author in Rage Becomes Her.

324
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:32,460
Well, here's the thing, simply being angry does not entitle you to something.

325
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,060
You might be angry and still be wrong.

326
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:40,500
What you're feeling, thinking and saying may matter, but it might also not be factually

327
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
correct.

328
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:47,140
In fact, you might be completely off base, and your anger might be completely unjustified.

329
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,020
That's why people say facts over feels.

330
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,340
This is a completely bullshit article, guys.

331
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,260
Number two, listen to your daughter.

332
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,220
Number three, give her a framework to express it.

333
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,340
Number four, start early.

334
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,800
Number five, help her smash the stereotypes.

335
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,340
And six, express your own anger directly.

336
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,700
Here's a general rule of thumb, and it applies to people of all ages, it applies to people

337
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,700
of all genders.

338
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,300
If you're angry, that means that you thought something was going to turn out one way, and

339
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,980
in fact turned out another way.

340
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,300
Something unexpected has appeared within your field of view.

341
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,500
And the first thing you need to do is take stock of yourself, because sometimes your

342
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:33,060
anger is because you've laid out a road map, and now you've realized that a tree has fallen

343
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,600
on the road, and now you have to try to find a way around it.

344
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,540
And most of the time, rather than getting angry, you can just find a way around it.

345
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:46,060
I would say overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly over the course of your life, if you're angry,

346
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,940
there's something you can tweak within yourself that will fix it.

347
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,680
And it might even be your fault.

348
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,140
It's not really important to have your anger validated or whatever feely bullshit this

349
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,780
article is talking about.

350
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,540
What's important is what you do about it.

351
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,120
And the first step is to always take stock of yourself.

352
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,500
And as I said, that advice applies to all genders, all 33 of them, in fact, according

353
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:13,980
to the Australian government, omnigender, neutrois, whatever the fuck that is, and intersex.

354
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,900
Australians to choose from 33 different gender labels for passports and birth certificates

355
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,620
under radical new labor proposal.

356
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,260
I want to see this list.

357
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,140
I hope the list is in the article because I want to read this shit.

358
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,760
Demigender is also among the 33 labels that will be discussed at the party's upcoming

359
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,500
national conference and could soon be seen printed on passports and birth certificates.

360
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,860
Let's see if this link contains the list.

361
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,340
I want to read it off right now.

362
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,340
I've got to log in.

363
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,340
Fuck that.

364
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,020
The proposal argues that transgender and intersex people would be able to enjoy equal human

365
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,860
rights without discrimination with the additional gender options.

366
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,780
The party would also look at promoting options beyond binary male and female.

367
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,140
And then here's a picture of someone writing in by sex as their selection.

368
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,660
From what I know about biology, which is honestly not much, I think there's like a grand total

369
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:11,300
of 12 various deformities that can happen.

370
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:16,060
It'll put you somewhere between male and female biologically, you know, various combinations

371
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,060
of nonfunctioning genitals.

372
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:22,800
And in fact, but these are like less than 1% of the population, like significantly less

373
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,180
than 1% of the fucking population.

374
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:33,780
So you have, I guess, a grand total of 14 genders where most are male and female.

375
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:40,260
And then an extreme minority is one of these 12 various disorders.

376
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:45,300
Because transgender people, for the most part, they want to be the gender that they're choosing.

377
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,440
You know, they don't want to be somewhere in between, you know, like if it's a male

378
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,460
to female transsexual person, they want to be female.

379
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,780
Okay, I've got the 33 guys, let's go through them.

380
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:05,140
A woman, a man, a transgender man, a transgender woman, a trans person, a trans man, a trans

381
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,140
woman.

382
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:12,380
Wait, isn't that just transgender man and transgender woman, but just shortened to trans

383
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,020
man and trans woman?

384
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:24,980
Female to male, male to female, transsexual, okay, these are just like these, this group

385
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:31,040
here are just rephrasing the exact same phenomenon, all of these ones.

386
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:40,940
A cisgender person, cisfemale, cismale, that's just woman to man, again.

387
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:47,080
Gender non-conforming, non-gender, okay, so, alright.

388
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:54,280
A non-binary person, neutrois, neutrois is a non-binary gender identity which is considered

389
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,800
to be a neutral or null gender, isn't that the same thing with non-gender, isn't that

390
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,560
what non-gender is, isn't that the same thing?

391
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,640
Okay, gender fluid, a person who does not identify entirely with either the male or

392
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,040
female genders, isn't that the same thing as non-binary?

393
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:20,560
Gender queer, again, it's the same description, demigender, this term, demi means half, is

394
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:26,160
an umbrella term for non-binary, okay, you're even using non-binary, something that you've

395
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:33,640
already defined up here in this definition, this is this, there's a demi girl, can also

396
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:39,360
be called a demi woman or a demi female, and there's also a demi boy, and they identify

397
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,600
partially, only partially, so that's kind of like a non-binary somewhere on the spectrum,

398
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,600
considering that demi means half, maybe this is just like half a person, maybe they lost

399
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,240
their legs in an accident or something, here we go, we got agender, this literally means

400
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:02,720
it without gender, isn't that neutroized, that's what this is, isn't it, just no gender,

401
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,400
you could just be agender as in a single one, agender, intergender, intergender people have

402
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,040
a gender identity that is in the middle, between the binary and gender, okay, these are all

403
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,960
rephrasing of the same thing, like I don't feel like a guy, I don't feel like a girl,

404
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,320
I'm in the middle somewhere, you know, I flipped the coin and it landed on its edge, that's

405
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,000
what all these mean, that's what all of these mean, and they're just rephrasing the same

406
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,680
fucking concept over and over, here's something that's actually different and has a grounding

407
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:34,440
in biology, intersex, a person who is born with a reproductive anatomy of both a man

408
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:43,640
and a woman, so we're talking about deformities here, you know, there are people who are born

409
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,920
with like a penis but it's like non-functioning and it's just a facade, right, and like underneath

410
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,480
it you have nothing, sometimes underneath it you have like a uterus that's like closed off,

411
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,280
and there are also other various deformities possible, I think I mentioned earlier that it

412
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:01,360
was about 12 of them that have been identified very strictly, this is where the whole idea of

413
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:07,720
the fucking Japanese Fudanari comes from, where you get like a woman but they have like a fully

414
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:13,100
functioning penis attached to the top of their vagina where a clit would be, that type of

415
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:18,420
intersex person is extremely rare, as far as I know, I guess they are like one in a billion

416
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,740
though so I guess they're out there somewhere, these people were previously referred to as

417
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,820
hermaphrodites but that term is considered rude and outdated, okay fine, here's something that

418
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:33,260
might actually need some kind of clarification on a passport for real, you finally found one on

419
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:40,380
this fucking list that is an exception to the rule, okay, uh, pangender, person who identifies

420
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:47,220
as more than one gender, okay, we're back to the bullshit, polygender translates to many genders,

421
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:54,860
a person who identifies as more than one gender, same thing as this, omnigender translates to all

422
00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:01,300
genders, a person identifies as more than one gender, all the same thing, bigender translates

423
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:06,500
to two genders, a person identifies as both male and female genders, some bigender people have two

424
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:12,820
distinct male and female personas that's called like multiple personality disorder

425
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,540
that's having a split personality your problems if you're if you're in this

426
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:22,260
camp your problems go far beyond anything to do with gender androgyne a

427
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,860
person who doesn't identify with either gender they are both feminine and

428
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:32,020
masculine androgyny is is just it's the same as androgyne they're the same root

429
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:37,700
this is a person and this is a quality third gender I understand that some

430
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:43,380
cultures do have a third gender option within them in their in their religious

431
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:49,420
and cultural practices and and fair enough fine here you go there's your

432
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,900
third gender for your passport try gender a person who shifts between the

433
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:57,940
male female and a third genders okay so so what are the actual legitimate ones

434
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:03,540
on this list okay we got let's go to the top we got a you got male you got

435
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:08,100
woman a man we've got the two transgender possibilities where it's a

436
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:14,380
male to female and female to male there's four you've got maybe like we'll

437
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:18,100
have like one for the non gender when you just have zero gender completely

438
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:24,380
okay there's five you've got intersex for the various deformities and and and

439
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,740
very various biological things that can happen there's six and then you have the

440
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,500
third gender for those cultures that have that there's seven okay okay I

441
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:37,380
think we can work it out now if you really want to include everything and be

442
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:43,780
as illogical as you can about it seven genders it's more than two and it does

443
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,740
cover everything and it doesn't appeal to all these ridiculous fucking people

444
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,780
who want to feel special about it I do have two more articles left however I'm

445
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,860
deciding to cut it short because after reading them I think they're actually

446
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:00,660
worth their own video so maybe I'll put that that out this week sometime thank

447
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,180
you very much for everyone who stuck through me over the past two weeks I am

448
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,140
very glad to be back you're going to be seeing daily uploads from me now

449
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,380
hopefully I'm gonna be doing some short videos some long videos and dumping with

450
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:16,660
scrumps some political videos some idea analysis videos I'll be I'll be doing

451
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,940
everything that I can to keep this channel active and running and as usual

452
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:28,260
I stream on Twitch as well five times a week twitch.tv slash game boomers and I

453
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,620
know at least a few of you decided to come over and say hi during my two-week

454
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,340
absence because despite all the YouTube channels being down I was still over

455
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:41,780
there and in fact I'll see you there again in a couple hours I love you guys
