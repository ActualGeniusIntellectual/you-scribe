0	5100	Hello and welcome back to SJ Weekly and welcome back to the channel, I'm back guys!
5100	9380	It is very good to see all of you here again, a special thanks to The Britisher for letting
9380	14160	me do the show on his channel while I was gone, and a very special thanks to all of
14160	19780	you guys, either in the comments sections or on Twitter, who tried to get me back on
19780	25120	YouTube, who rooted for me, and who welcomed me back yesterday during my 18 second I'm
25120	26120	Back video.
26120	31200	And I must be doing something right, because there are a lot of the angry usual suspects
31200	34380	in my Twitter mentions right now, so we're on the right track guys.
34380	38800	During the two week vacation, one of the things I did was I went home and visited my parents,
38800	46160	we did an early Christmas, and one of the gifts that I got was a set of cold brew coffees,
46160	49920	different brews, so I guess I'll be drinking those for a while.
49920	53720	What a cold brew coffee is, if you don't know, is they take the coffee grounds, put it in
53720	57920	cold water, and they just let it sit there for like a day, and let it kind of cold brew
57920	61680	up, and then they drain the grounds out, and then you have coffee.
61680	71480	So this is the hazelnut coffee, let's give it a shot.
71480	76900	It's a bit stronger than regular hazelnut coffee it seems.
76900	80920	I've heated it up so it's still like a regular cup of coffee, it's a bit stronger, the hazelnut
80920	81920	comes through a bit more.
81920	86000	It's not bad though, I don't know if I drink it every day, but it's pretty good.
86000	91700	Let's begin this week with Muslim Amazon workers say they don't have enough time to pray, now
91700	93800	they're fighting for their rights.
93800	98920	East African immigrant workers in Minneapolis are rallying for fair treatment, whoever wins
98920	100760	we lose I guess.
100760	106320	You know you're in Minneapolis right, holding a sign in your native language probably won't
106320	107760	help that much.
107760	112180	Somali community members in Minneapolis rallied against Amazon in July 2018 for allegedly
112180	115960	firing a Muslim worker who slowed down during Ramadan.
115960	121800	See this is what I mean when I say whoever wins we lose, because Amazon is legitimately
121800	124840	a shitty company, they really mistreat their workers.
124840	131480	However I don't like the idea of special rights being carved out for small subsections of
131480	133680	the population and only them.
133680	137800	As a practicing Muslim, Ebrahim tries to pray five times a day.
137800	142540	But because Amazon has the warehouse associates working on a strict hourly packing quota,
142540	145400	she says she cannot take a prayer break.
145400	151160	Well, keep in mind that the Quran not only says to pray five times a day, but that women
151160	153520	can't work outside of the house.
153520	156020	So what are you doing working at Amazon?
156020	160660	Associates are pressured to make rate, with the rate number increasing and decreasing
160660	162600	depending on the season's demand.
162600	168040	The warehouse's current packing rate is 240 boxes an hour, Ebrahim says, but it's gone
168040	169980	as high as 400.
169980	173520	Associates are penalized if they fall behind this rate, they can get a write up from a
173520	177540	manager if they're too slow, which can lead them to being terminated.
177540	182640	And this is what I mean by being a shit job, sometimes, for literally peanuts, companies
182640	187880	expect the world out of their employees, Walmart's another egregious example of this.
187880	191520	Ebrahim usually chooses to pray during her timed breaks.
191520	194640	Breaks make our rates slow down, and we get the risk of getting fired, and so most of
194640	199500	the time we choose prayer over bathroom, and have learned to balance our bodily needs.
199500	202380	And that's another piece of bullshit, yeah, you should be able to go to the washroom whenever
202380	206800	you have to go, like, sometimes these companies are just ridiculous.
206800	213400	Ebrahim, who works a 12 hour night shift from 5.30pm to 6am, says she's worked about 20
213400	217240	different jobs since moving to the US as a 16 year old in 2004.
217240	220320	Those jobs include working a fishing boat in the middle of the ocean off the coast of
220320	225400	Alaska, cleaning Chicago's O'Hare airport, and packing at a Target warehouse.
225400	228840	Her current job at Amazon, she says, has been her hardest.
228840	233680	I understand that Amazon can be pretty shit, and I'm not necessarily saying that it's not
233680	236920	hard, but I have a hard time believing that working on a fishing boat isn't harder.
236920	242460	Like fishermen, they do some pretty rough jobs man, and I gotta say, if this is so terrible
242460	244360	why don't you switch jobs again?
244360	248700	You're obviously okay with switching jobs, I mean, you've done it many times, 20 different
248700	252980	jobs in the past, what is that, 14 years, 15 years?
252980	257360	With that many job switches, maybe the problem is that you can't hold a job down.
257360	261420	And she says, I want to keep this job to provide for my family, and I'm also working as hard
261420	264500	as I can, but you can't live under this type of pressure.
264500	268140	The way Amazon pushes people is not moral.
268140	272700	In a statement to Vox, an Amazon spokesperson touted the facility's excellent pay and comprehensive
272700	273700	benefits.
273700	278120	Well, I mean, maybe the facility does have excellent pay and comprehensive benefits,
278120	279840	and that's why they push people.
279840	284040	Maybe the facility doesn't have that, and therefore Amazon is just complete shit.
284040	289960	But nonetheless, if you're a Muslim woman, again, why are you providing for your family?
289960	292560	That's not within the tenets of your religion.
292560	297800	Ibrahim says the workers are asking to be treated humanely, calling on Amazon to display
297800	300560	racial and cultural sensitivity.
300560	302180	Those are two different things.
302180	305880	To be treated humanely is one thing, yes.
305880	308160	Fair pay for fair work.
308160	311480	Don't overwork people into the fucking grave.
311480	313400	Provide reasonable breaks.
313400	318280	But racial and cultural sensitivity is outside of that.
318280	319960	That's something different entirely.
319960	324960	Because you don't have time to pray five times a day, that's not based on your race or ethnicity.
324960	329640	It is based on your religion, but the problem would be your religion, not necessarily the
329640	330640	workplace.
330920	336880	Amazon made changes that mainly dealt with issues around practicing Islam, oh boy.
336880	341240	Muslim Amazon workers had no place to pray in the warehouse, and they complained about
341240	345880	not being able to keep up with the job during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, where they
345880	347200	fast until sundown.
347200	349200	Well, is there a church inside an Amazon warehouse?
349200	351360	Do they provide that shit too?
351360	355480	Amazon responded by creating a dedicated prayer space, I'm sure, and said it has been working
355480	358500	to make shifts more manageable during Ramadan.
358500	362420	But employees complain that these moves are like band-aids that address small issues
362420	364180	without tackling the larger problems.
364180	366300	What do you mean?
366300	370180	In my opinion, these are ridiculous things to do, but they directly address the problem.
370180	371980	What more could you want than this?
371980	377260	They give you a dedicated prayer room, and then they ease up on your quotas during Ramadan.
377260	379080	That's literally what you asked for.
379080	385380	During Ramadan, employees have the right to use PTO, personal time off, unpaid time off,
385380	389500	or vacation time if they have time available in their account.
389500	394820	They have to use those banked time allotments for religious holidays, giving them less time
394820	399580	than their non-Muslim co-workers to take off for when their kids are sick.
399580	401660	You don't think that Christians take time off sometimes.
401660	404980	You don't think there might be a Christian working for Amazon who takes Sundays off to
404980	405980	go to church?
405980	409540	You don't think there might be a Christian who works for Amazon who takes time around
409540	411260	Christmas and Easter off?
411260	414480	Unless you're comparing yourself to atheists, in which case you have a point, but that is
414480	416580	what you choose when you follow a religion.
416580	421520	If you want time set aside, you have to have time set aside, and it is entirely fair that
421520	425760	you have an equal amount of time set aside, you're just choosing to use it for religious
425760	426880	purposes.
426880	430880	Amazon said, we work hard every day to ensure all of our employees are treated fairly and
430880	435080	with dignity and respect, including here in Minnesota, where we have an open and direct
435080	436960	dialogue with employees.
436960	442480	Amazon offers a great employment opportunity with excellent pay, ranging from $16.25 an
442480	448920	hour to $20.80 an hour, and comprehensive benefits including healthcare, up to 20 weeks
448920	453840	parental leave, paid education, promotional opportunities, and more.
453840	459020	We encourage anyone to compare our pay, benefits, and workplace to other retailers and major
459020	462320	employers in the community and across the country.
462320	466040	We invite anyone to see for themselves and take a tour through our fulfillment center
466040	467040	tour program.
467040	468040	Well, there you go.
468040	473440	I mean, that's not super amazing pay, but it's certainly better than average.
473440	475820	And it's just for packing boxes.
475820	479520	Regarding its prayer breaks, Amazon told the author of this article that prayer breaks
479520	486560	less than 20 minutes are paid and productivity expectations are not adjusted for such breaks.
486560	491120	Associates are welcome to request an unpaid prayer break for over 20 minutes, for which
491120	493840	productivity expectations would be adjusted.
493840	494840	That sounds fair.
494840	499800	There's obviously the possibility that Amazon might be lying here, but if they're not, they
499800	501600	seem like they're doing an alright job already.
501600	506280	Ibrahim also says that until recently, nearly all Amazon managers in the warehouse were
506280	510640	white, which contributed to the culture gap many African workers perceive in the facility.
510640	511640	Oh, okay.
511640	515560	Everything up until now has mentioned Islam, but now suddenly we're talking about white
515560	516560	people.
516560	517560	It's gone from religion to race.
517560	521360	I don't want to sound like an Amazon apologist here because I know that there's actually
521360	529080	a lot wrong with Amazon, but I think this, this racial religious hodgepodge complaint
529080	531080	is not the place to go with these protests.
531080	537080	But speaking of religion, God wrongfully impregnated teenage Virgin Mary without consent, says
537080	539600	Minnesota professor.
539600	544600	Um, he's, he's not wrong, I guess.
544600	551080	Virgin birth story is unethical abuse of power at best and grossly predatory at worst.
551800	556400	A Minnesota state university professor tweeted this week that Mary, the Virgin could not
556400	561820	have consented the conception of Christ and that God was behaving therefore in a quote
561820	563480	predatory manner.
563480	566520	That professor whose salary is paid for by taxpayers also tweeted himself decorating
566520	569720	a Christmas tree with satanic ornaments.
569720	572560	Have you taken any of his classes, Mark Stein?
572560	573560	No.
573560	579020	And the reason is this is the thing that this is because 50 years ago, this kind of shallow
579060	584260	banality would have been the province of a drunk undergraduate at three in the morning.
584260	590860	Um, I mean, basically the idea that, that God, uh, has gotten the Virgin Mary back to
590860	594040	his pad and she's saying, I really must go.
594040	599060	And he's saying, Oh baby, it's cold outside and put some records on while I pour.
599060	607420	I miss the days when atheists were at least intelligent enough to take seriously what
607420	609220	they were porting to knock down.
609220	612860	I mean, I don't really care about the satanic ornaments on your tree.
612860	613860	Do whatever you want.
613860	615780	But this is really stupid, isn't it?
615780	619920	This professor wrote the Virgin birth story is about an all knowing all powerful deity
619920	622460	impregnating a human teen.
622460	623620	Was was Mary a teen?
623620	626420	I mean, she might've been, it was, it was the ancient times, right?
626420	627720	But whatever.
627720	630260	There was no definition of consent that would include that scenario.
630260	631260	Happy holidays.
631260	635140	He later added the biblical God regularly punished disobedience, the power difference
635140	639460	deity versus mortal and the potential for violence for saying no negates her yes to
639460	644980	put someone in this position isn't an ethical abuse of power at best and grossly predatory
644980	645980	at worst.
645980	650020	The problem is not necessarily with what he's saying because I guess factually, if we're
650020	653260	going just strictly with what he said, he's correct.
653260	659060	However, what he's missing is that you cannot judge yesterday by today's morals.
659060	664260	There are various figures who lived throughout human history that by today's standards would
664260	669140	be considered immoral people, certainly, but by their own standards, they were paragons
669140	670140	of virtue.
670140	676820	And that's because just like any other form of, of advancement, whether it's, it's technological
676820	684740	or artistic advances in politics and philosophy also take time and you can't really judge
684740	688620	somebody living in the past for not living up to today's standards.
688620	691700	They had no concept of, of liberalism.
691700	695980	Some of them, if you go back far enough, there were no concept of universal human rights.
695980	700920	So to take a religious tale that was set in an era 2000 years ago and judge it by today's
700920	703140	morality is, is just stupidity.
703140	706600	However, there is a, there's a link in the middle of this article that says Nebraska
706600	711380	principle bans candy canes because the shape is a J for Jesus.
711380	712660	Let's see what that's all about.
712660	717780	The J shape stands for Jesus according to the blaze, but that was just for starters.
717780	721700	Also on the naughty list were Christmas carols, Christmas music, and making Christmas ornaments
721700	722700	as gifts.
722700	725500	You know, you know, I never really liked candy canes.
725500	729420	There are like strawberry flavored ones that are pretty okay, but the normal ones are just
729420	730420	eh.
730420	736300	A Nebraska elementary school principal named Jennifer Sinclair gave out this list of things
736300	740700	that were not allowed at Manchester elementary school in Omaha.
740700	747660	Santas or Christmas items on worksheets, Christmas trees in the classrooms, elf on the shelf,
747660	751580	bringing Christmas carols, playing Christmas music, sending a scholastic book that is a
751580	755660	Christmas book, making a Christmas ornament as a gift.
755660	756660	Candy canes.
756660	758800	Historically, the shape is a J for Jesus.
758800	762200	The red is for the blood of Christ and the white is a symbol of his resurrection.
762200	765540	Is that, is that actually what a candy cane is all about?
765540	766980	I don't know.
766980	767980	Red and green items.
767980	769500	So nothing red and green.
769500	774900	Those are just off-limits colors, reindeer, Christmas videos, movies, or characters from
774900	775900	Christmas movies.
776260	777260	Just no Christmas.
777260	778260	It's gone.
778260	783340	Sinclair, who's in her first year as Manchester's principal noted in the memo that she comes
783340	787580	from a place that Christmas and the like are not allowed in schools and that as a public
787580	792300	school, Manchester elementary will seek to be inclusive and culturally sensitive to all
792300	793420	of our students.
793420	797420	Make sure those students know to celebrate their generic winter holiday.
797420	803020	And actually I think her, her list of acceptable practices kind of reinforced that idea.
803020	805020	Gifts are okay.
805020	806660	Making gifts are okay.
806660	810580	Snow men, snow women, snow people, snowflakes.
810580	814060	I'm pretty sure the principal is a fucking snowflake.
814060	818380	Gingerbread people, not gingerbread men, according to the, what was it?
818380	822800	Was it Scotland that recently outlawed gingerbread men in favor of gingerbread people?
822800	827220	Holidays around the world, except not Christmas, apparently.
827220	830980	I know that, you know, Christmas is celebrated around the world.
830980	834460	There are Christians around the world, but I guess they don't count.
834460	835460	Sledding is good.
835460	841740	Hot chocolate, polar bears, penguins, scarves, boots, earmuffs, wait, wait, hold on.
841740	842740	Penguins.
842740	844860	They're in the South pole, not the North.
844860	846980	Scarves, boots, earmuffs, and hats.
846980	848180	You don't want them to freeze.
848180	851020	Can't ban those or else the kids will start dying.
851020	856660	Yetis and Olaf from Frozen.
856660	860800	It does seem like sanity has prevailed though, because Liberty council sent a demand letter
860800	865480	to the superintendent about the Christmas ban, urging it to be immediately overruled
865480	869720	and specifically disavowed the sweeping directive banning Christmas holiday items.
869720	873560	And the district's response to Liberty council said that it had investigated the matter and
873560	877200	determined that principal Sinclair's memorandum did not comply with board policy.
877200	882360	And the update shows that the principal has issued an apology, so I guess all's right
882360	883360	in the world.
883360	885800	You know, I'm not even a Christian, right?
885800	891920	But I cannot deny the cultural significance that Christmas has in western society.
891920	896320	I'm not even talking about the religious significance, and I'm sure for religious people there is
896320	902560	a great religious significance, but for non-religious people to simply celebrate Christmas as a
902560	907440	secular holiday, that shouldn't be taken away from them.
907440	913300	Western nations do have a culture all to their own, just like every other nation does, and
913300	914940	we should not be ashamed of it.
914940	919180	We certainly shouldn't think that ours is somehow superior to others, but we shouldn't
919180	923420	be okay with it simply being washed away in the name of political correctness.
923420	927000	Here's some more school nonsense from our old friends over at Breitbart.
927000	930380	Germany launches how to identify Nazi parents guide for schools.
930380	936420	I can see Germany doing this honestly, they're very Nazi-phobic and frankly I don't blame
936420	939060	them considering what happened.
939060	945620	However, a new booklet for daycare workers that claims to help identify Nazi parents
945620	950420	suggests looking out for girls with braided hair and athletic boys.
950420	955740	It's all it takes to be a Nazi nowadays, guys.
955740	959660	If your little girl has her hair braided, her parents are a Nazi, and she's being raised
959660	961740	to be a Nazi.
961740	967700	If the little boy is athletic, if he likes to run around or play a sport at school, Nazi.
967700	973020	People have labeled this booklet that's been handed out as parenting espionage or spying
973020	976800	on parents, and the booklet has been criticized because it identifies the way children dress
976800	979920	or how much physical activity they participate in as being potential signs that their parents
979920	980920	might be Nazis.
980920	982780	The criticism of that does not fit into democracy.
982780	985740	It very clearly does not fit in with fucking democracy.
985740	994260	You can't say, unless they're wearing an actual Nazi uniform, and even then there are reasons
994260	1000700	to wear actual Nazi uniforms that don't make you a Nazi, believe it or not, but like how
1000700	1007780	people dress and how much physical activity they participate in, really, that's what makes
1007780	1008780	you a Nazi.
1008780	1009780	You're going to be a weightlifter.
1009780	1010780	You're a Nazi.
1010780	1011780	You're going to be a professional sports star.
1011780	1012780	You're a Nazi.
1012780	1015320	The foundation that put out these booklets defended it by claiming that the case studies
1015320	1020220	were based on real life cases they had witnessed, including a girl with braided hair whose parents
1020220	1022420	turned out to be far-right extremists.
1022420	1027580	This does not mean that all girls with braided hair are going to have parents that are far-right
1027580	1029320	extremists.
1029320	1034560	This is some D&D causes satanic panic shit, all right?
1034560	1040620	This is some video games cause school shooters gamers rise up bottom text actually shit.
1040620	1045320	The case studies echo research presented by Antifa groups in 2016, which claimed that
1045320	1050700	Volkstfamilies, those who believe in countryside living and traditional German culture and
1050700	1053500	values, posed a threat to Germany.
1053500	1059260	Anti-fascist action group member Olof Meyer warned of young couples who buy farms and
1059260	1061900	restore them together with their relatives and friends.
1061900	1063740	Yeah, this.
1063740	1065300	This is Nazism, guys.
1065300	1066300	This is it.
1066300	1068400	You know, you buy a fixer-upper?
1068400	1070460	You want to have kids?
1070460	1071460	You're a fucking Nazi.
1071460	1076220	Why aren't you participating in the absolute demographic destruction of the native German
1076220	1077900	population?
1077900	1080180	Is it because you're a Nazi?
1080660	1081660	This is so fucking stupid.
1081660	1085940	Let's learn the politically acceptable way to manipulate your children, according to
1085940	1088020	the Washington Post anyway.
1088020	1091060	Parents should encourage girls to get angry and show it.
1091060	1092060	Here's how.
1092060	1095580	We are so busy teaching girls to be likable that we forget to teach them that they have
1095580	1099100	the right to be respected, and the effects of that carry into adulthood.
1099100	1102700	Women and men experience anger the same way, but men are much more likely to express that
1102700	1105780	anger verbally, while women tend to keep it to themselves.
1105780	1107980	In doing so, we lose our ability to defend ourselves.
1107980	1109580	See, I'm not sure this is the truth.
1109580	1115660	I remember reading a different study where when adult men are angry, they're more likely
1115660	1121820	to express it physically, while when adult women are angry, they're more likely to express
1121820	1123740	it verbally.
1123740	1127860	They don't yell at people necessarily, though they do that sometimes, and they do get physical
1127860	1133500	sometimes too, but overwhelmingly women tend to spread rumors, they tend to slander, and
1133500	1136940	they tend to defame people.
1136940	1144040	There is a gendered component to how boys and girls, and men and women, let off steam
1144040	1145040	in this way.
1145040	1149020	Well, this author is committed to changing that in her home with her girls, ages six
1149020	1150020	and eleven.
1150020	1151980	Here's her six-point plan.
1151980	1153460	Oh boy.
1153460	1156340	One, share the positive power of anger.
1156340	1162000	Saying I am angry is a necessary first step to listen, believe me, listen and believe,
1162000	1163620	trust me, I know.
1163620	1167300	Time to do something, writes the author in Rage Becomes Her.
1167300	1172460	Well, here's the thing, simply being angry does not entitle you to something.
1172460	1175060	You might be angry and still be wrong.
1175060	1180500	What you're feeling, thinking and saying may matter, but it might also not be factually
1180500	1181500	correct.
1181500	1187140	In fact, you might be completely off base, and your anger might be completely unjustified.
1187140	1190020	That's why people say facts over feels.
1190020	1192340	This is a completely bullshit article, guys.
1192340	1194260	Number two, listen to your daughter.
1194260	1197220	Number three, give her a framework to express it.
1197220	1199340	Number four, start early.
1199340	1201800	Number five, help her smash the stereotypes.
1201800	1205340	And six, express your own anger directly.
1205340	1209700	Here's a general rule of thumb, and it applies to people of all ages, it applies to people
1209700	1210700	of all genders.
1210700	1215300	If you're angry, that means that you thought something was going to turn out one way, and
1215300	1216980	in fact turned out another way.
1216980	1221300	Something unexpected has appeared within your field of view.
1221300	1225500	And the first thing you need to do is take stock of yourself, because sometimes your
1225500	1233060	anger is because you've laid out a road map, and now you've realized that a tree has fallen
1233060	1236600	on the road, and now you have to try to find a way around it.
1236600	1240540	And most of the time, rather than getting angry, you can just find a way around it.
1240540	1246060	I would say overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly over the course of your life, if you're angry,
1246060	1249940	there's something you can tweak within yourself that will fix it.
1249940	1251680	And it might even be your fault.
1251680	1256140	It's not really important to have your anger validated or whatever feely bullshit this
1256140	1257780	article is talking about.
1257780	1259540	What's important is what you do about it.
1259540	1263120	And the first step is to always take stock of yourself.
1263120	1267500	And as I said, that advice applies to all genders, all 33 of them, in fact, according
1267500	1273980	to the Australian government, omnigender, neutrois, whatever the fuck that is, and intersex.
1273980	1278900	Australians to choose from 33 different gender labels for passports and birth certificates
1278900	1283620	under radical new labor proposal.
1283620	1285260	I want to see this list.
1285260	1289140	I hope the list is in the article because I want to read this shit.
1289140	1293760	Demigender is also among the 33 labels that will be discussed at the party's upcoming
1293760	1300500	national conference and could soon be seen printed on passports and birth certificates.
1300500	1301860	Let's see if this link contains the list.
1301860	1303340	I want to read it off right now.
1303340	1304340	I've got to log in.
1304340	1305340	Fuck that.
1305340	1309020	The proposal argues that transgender and intersex people would be able to enjoy equal human
1309020	1312860	rights without discrimination with the additional gender options.
1312860	1317780	The party would also look at promoting options beyond binary male and female.
1317780	1322140	And then here's a picture of someone writing in by sex as their selection.
1322140	1326660	From what I know about biology, which is honestly not much, I think there's like a grand total
1326660	1331300	of 12 various deformities that can happen.
1331300	1336060	It'll put you somewhere between male and female biologically, you know, various combinations
1336060	1337060	of nonfunctioning genitals.
1337060	1342800	And in fact, but these are like less than 1% of the population, like significantly less
1342800	1345180	than 1% of the fucking population.
1345180	1353780	So you have, I guess, a grand total of 14 genders where most are male and female.
1353780	1360260	And then an extreme minority is one of these 12 various disorders.
1360260	1365300	Because transgender people, for the most part, they want to be the gender that they're choosing.
1365300	1369440	You know, they don't want to be somewhere in between, you know, like if it's a male
1369440	1373460	to female transsexual person, they want to be female.
1373460	1376780	Okay, I've got the 33 guys, let's go through them.
1376780	1385140	A woman, a man, a transgender man, a transgender woman, a trans person, a trans man, a trans
1385140	1386140	woman.
1386140	1392380	Wait, isn't that just transgender man and transgender woman, but just shortened to trans
1392380	1395020	man and trans woman?
1395020	1404980	Female to male, male to female, transsexual, okay, these are just like these, this group
1404980	1411040	here are just rephrasing the exact same phenomenon, all of these ones.
1411040	1420940	A cisgender person, cisfemale, cismale, that's just woman to man, again.
1420940	1427080	Gender non-conforming, non-gender, okay, so, alright.
1427080	1434280	A non-binary person, neutrois, neutrois is a non-binary gender identity which is considered
1434280	1438800	to be a neutral or null gender, isn't that the same thing with non-gender, isn't that
1438800	1442560	what non-gender is, isn't that the same thing?
1442560	1446640	Okay, gender fluid, a person who does not identify entirely with either the male or
1446640	1452040	female genders, isn't that the same thing as non-binary?
1452040	1460560	Gender queer, again, it's the same description, demigender, this term, demi means half, is
1460560	1466160	an umbrella term for non-binary, okay, you're even using non-binary, something that you've
1466160	1473640	already defined up here in this definition, this is this, there's a demi girl, can also
1473640	1479360	be called a demi woman or a demi female, and there's also a demi boy, and they identify
1479360	1484600	partially, only partially, so that's kind of like a non-binary somewhere on the spectrum,
1484600	1489600	considering that demi means half, maybe this is just like half a person, maybe they lost
1489600	1494240	their legs in an accident or something, here we go, we got agender, this literally means
1494240	1502720	it without gender, isn't that neutroized, that's what this is, isn't it, just no gender,
1502720	1509400	you could just be agender as in a single one, agender, intergender, intergender people have
1509400	1513040	a gender identity that is in the middle, between the binary and gender, okay, these are all
1513040	1517960	rephrasing of the same thing, like I don't feel like a guy, I don't feel like a girl,
1517960	1522320	I'm in the middle somewhere, you know, I flipped the coin and it landed on its edge, that's
1522320	1526000	what all these mean, that's what all of these mean, and they're just rephrasing the same
1526000	1529680	fucking concept over and over, here's something that's actually different and has a grounding
1529680	1534440	in biology, intersex, a person who is born with a reproductive anatomy of both a man
1534440	1543640	and a woman, so we're talking about deformities here, you know, there are people who are born
1543640	1547920	with like a penis but it's like non-functioning and it's just a facade, right, and like underneath
1547920	1552480	it you have nothing, sometimes underneath it you have like a uterus that's like closed off,
1552480	1556280	and there are also other various deformities possible, I think I mentioned earlier that it
1556280	1561360	was about 12 of them that have been identified very strictly, this is where the whole idea of
1561360	1567720	the fucking Japanese Fudanari comes from, where you get like a woman but they have like a fully
1567720	1573100	functioning penis attached to the top of their vagina where a clit would be, that type of
1573100	1578420	intersex person is extremely rare, as far as I know, I guess they are like one in a billion
1578420	1581740	though so I guess they're out there somewhere, these people were previously referred to as
1581740	1586820	hermaphrodites but that term is considered rude and outdated, okay fine, here's something that
1586820	1593260	might actually need some kind of clarification on a passport for real, you finally found one on
1593260	1600380	this fucking list that is an exception to the rule, okay, uh, pangender, person who identifies
1600380	1607220	as more than one gender, okay, we're back to the bullshit, polygender translates to many genders,
1607220	1614860	a person who identifies as more than one gender, same thing as this, omnigender translates to all
1614860	1621300	genders, a person identifies as more than one gender, all the same thing, bigender translates
1621300	1626500	to two genders, a person identifies as both male and female genders, some bigender people have two
1626500	1632820	distinct male and female personas that's called like multiple personality disorder
1632820	1636540	that's having a split personality your problems if you're if you're in this
1636540	1642260	camp your problems go far beyond anything to do with gender androgyne a
1642260	1645860	person who doesn't identify with either gender they are both feminine and
1645860	1652020	masculine androgyny is is just it's the same as androgyne they're the same root
1652020	1657700	this is a person and this is a quality third gender I understand that some
1657700	1663380	cultures do have a third gender option within them in their in their religious
1663380	1669420	and cultural practices and and fair enough fine here you go there's your
1669420	1672900	third gender for your passport try gender a person who shifts between the
1672900	1677940	male female and a third genders okay so so what are the actual legitimate ones
1677940	1683540	on this list okay we got let's go to the top we got a you got male you got
1683540	1688100	woman a man we've got the two transgender possibilities where it's a
1688100	1694380	male to female and female to male there's four you've got maybe like we'll
1694380	1698100	have like one for the non gender when you just have zero gender completely
1698100	1704380	okay there's five you've got intersex for the various deformities and and and
1704380	1708740	very various biological things that can happen there's six and then you have the
1708740	1712500	third gender for those cultures that have that there's seven okay okay I
1712500	1717380	think we can work it out now if you really want to include everything and be
1717380	1723780	as illogical as you can about it seven genders it's more than two and it does
1723780	1728740	cover everything and it doesn't appeal to all these ridiculous fucking people
1728740	1732780	who want to feel special about it I do have two more articles left however I'm
1732780	1735860	deciding to cut it short because after reading them I think they're actually
1735860	1740660	worth their own video so maybe I'll put that that out this week sometime thank
1740660	1744180	you very much for everyone who stuck through me over the past two weeks I am
1744180	1748140	very glad to be back you're going to be seeing daily uploads from me now
1748140	1751380	hopefully I'm gonna be doing some short videos some long videos and dumping with
1751380	1756660	scrumps some political videos some idea analysis videos I'll be I'll be doing
1756660	1760940	everything that I can to keep this channel active and running and as usual
1760940	1768260	I stream on Twitch as well five times a week twitch.tv slash game boomers and I
1768260	1771620	know at least a few of you decided to come over and say hi during my two-week
1771620	1775340	absence because despite all the YouTube channels being down I was still over
1775340	1781780	there and in fact I'll see you there again in a couple hours I love you guys
