00:00.000 --> 00:05.100
Hello and welcome back to SJ Weekly and welcome back to the channel, I'm back guys!

00:05.100 --> 00:09.380
It is very good to see all of you here again, a special thanks to The Britisher for letting

00:09.380 --> 00:14.160
me do the show on his channel while I was gone, and a very special thanks to all of

00:14.160 --> 00:19.780
you guys, either in the comments sections or on Twitter, who tried to get me back on

00:19.780 --> 00:25.120
YouTube, who rooted for me, and who welcomed me back yesterday during my 18 second I'm

00:25.120 --> 00:26.120
Back video.

00:26.120 --> 00:31.200
And I must be doing something right, because there are a lot of the angry usual suspects

00:31.200 --> 00:34.380
in my Twitter mentions right now, so we're on the right track guys.

00:34.380 --> 00:38.800
During the two week vacation, one of the things I did was I went home and visited my parents,

00:38.800 --> 00:46.160
we did an early Christmas, and one of the gifts that I got was a set of cold brew coffees,

00:46.160 --> 00:49.920
different brews, so I guess I'll be drinking those for a while.

00:49.920 --> 00:53.720
What a cold brew coffee is, if you don't know, is they take the coffee grounds, put it in

00:53.720 --> 00:57.920
cold water, and they just let it sit there for like a day, and let it kind of cold brew

00:57.920 --> 01:01.680
up, and then they drain the grounds out, and then you have coffee.

01:01.680 --> 01:11.480
So this is the hazelnut coffee, let's give it a shot.

01:11.480 --> 01:16.900
It's a bit stronger than regular hazelnut coffee it seems.

01:16.900 --> 01:20.920
I've heated it up so it's still like a regular cup of coffee, it's a bit stronger, the hazelnut

01:20.920 --> 01:21.920
comes through a bit more.

01:21.920 --> 01:26.000
It's not bad though, I don't know if I drink it every day, but it's pretty good.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.700
Let's begin this week with Muslim Amazon workers say they don't have enough time to pray, now

01:31.700 --> 01:33.800
they're fighting for their rights.

01:33.800 --> 01:38.920
East African immigrant workers in Minneapolis are rallying for fair treatment, whoever wins

01:38.920 --> 01:40.760
we lose I guess.

01:40.760 --> 01:46.320
You know you're in Minneapolis right, holding a sign in your native language probably won't

01:46.320 --> 01:47.760
help that much.

01:47.760 --> 01:52.180
Somali community members in Minneapolis rallied against Amazon in July 2018 for allegedly

01:52.180 --> 01:55.960
firing a Muslim worker who slowed down during Ramadan.

01:55.960 --> 02:01.800
See this is what I mean when I say whoever wins we lose, because Amazon is legitimately

02:01.800 --> 02:04.840
a shitty company, they really mistreat their workers.

02:04.840 --> 02:11.480
However I don't like the idea of special rights being carved out for small subsections of

02:11.480 --> 02:13.680
the population and only them.

02:13.680 --> 02:17.800
As a practicing Muslim, Ebrahim tries to pray five times a day.

02:17.800 --> 02:22.540
But because Amazon has the warehouse associates working on a strict hourly packing quota,

02:22.540 --> 02:25.400
she says she cannot take a prayer break.

02:25.400 --> 02:31.160
Well, keep in mind that the Quran not only says to pray five times a day, but that women

02:31.160 --> 02:33.520
can't work outside of the house.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.020
So what are you doing working at Amazon?

02:36.020 --> 02:40.660
Associates are pressured to make rate, with the rate number increasing and decreasing

02:40.660 --> 02:42.600
depending on the season's demand.

02:42.600 --> 02:48.040
The warehouse's current packing rate is 240 boxes an hour, Ebrahim says, but it's gone

02:48.040 --> 02:49.980
as high as 400.

02:49.980 --> 02:53.520
Associates are penalized if they fall behind this rate, they can get a write up from a

02:53.520 --> 02:57.540
manager if they're too slow, which can lead them to being terminated.

02:57.540 --> 03:02.640
And this is what I mean by being a shit job, sometimes, for literally peanuts, companies

03:02.640 --> 03:07.880
expect the world out of their employees, Walmart's another egregious example of this.

03:07.880 --> 03:11.520
Ebrahim usually chooses to pray during her timed breaks.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.640
Breaks make our rates slow down, and we get the risk of getting fired, and so most of

03:14.640 --> 03:19.500
the time we choose prayer over bathroom, and have learned to balance our bodily needs.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.380
And that's another piece of bullshit, yeah, you should be able to go to the washroom whenever

03:22.380 --> 03:26.800
you have to go, like, sometimes these companies are just ridiculous.

03:26.800 --> 03:33.400
Ebrahim, who works a 12 hour night shift from 5.30pm to 6am, says she's worked about 20

03:33.400 --> 03:37.240
different jobs since moving to the US as a 16 year old in 2004.

03:37.240 --> 03:40.320
Those jobs include working a fishing boat in the middle of the ocean off the coast of

03:40.320 --> 03:45.400
Alaska, cleaning Chicago's O'Hare airport, and packing at a Target warehouse.

03:45.400 --> 03:48.840
Her current job at Amazon, she says, has been her hardest.

03:48.840 --> 03:53.680
I understand that Amazon can be pretty shit, and I'm not necessarily saying that it's not

03:53.680 --> 03:56.920
hard, but I have a hard time believing that working on a fishing boat isn't harder.

03:56.920 --> 04:02.460
Like fishermen, they do some pretty rough jobs man, and I gotta say, if this is so terrible

04:02.460 --> 04:04.360
why don't you switch jobs again?

04:04.360 --> 04:08.700
You're obviously okay with switching jobs, I mean, you've done it many times, 20 different

04:08.700 --> 04:12.980
jobs in the past, what is that, 14 years, 15 years?

04:12.980 --> 04:17.360
With that many job switches, maybe the problem is that you can't hold a job down.

04:17.360 --> 04:21.420
And she says, I want to keep this job to provide for my family, and I'm also working as hard

04:21.420 --> 04:24.500
as I can, but you can't live under this type of pressure.

04:24.500 --> 04:28.140
The way Amazon pushes people is not moral.

04:28.140 --> 04:32.700
In a statement to Vox, an Amazon spokesperson touted the facility's excellent pay and comprehensive

04:32.700 --> 04:33.700
benefits.

04:33.700 --> 04:38.120
Well, I mean, maybe the facility does have excellent pay and comprehensive benefits,

04:38.120 --> 04:39.840
and that's why they push people.

04:39.840 --> 04:44.040
Maybe the facility doesn't have that, and therefore Amazon is just complete shit.

04:44.040 --> 04:49.960
But nonetheless, if you're a Muslim woman, again, why are you providing for your family?

04:49.960 --> 04:52.560
That's not within the tenets of your religion.

04:52.560 --> 04:57.800
Ibrahim says the workers are asking to be treated humanely, calling on Amazon to display

04:57.800 --> 05:00.560
racial and cultural sensitivity.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.180
Those are two different things.

05:02.180 --> 05:05.880
To be treated humanely is one thing, yes.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.160
Fair pay for fair work.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.480
Don't overwork people into the fucking grave.

05:11.480 --> 05:13.400
Provide reasonable breaks.

05:13.400 --> 05:18.280
But racial and cultural sensitivity is outside of that.

05:18.280 --> 05:19.960
That's something different entirely.

05:19.960 --> 05:24.960
Because you don't have time to pray five times a day, that's not based on your race or ethnicity.

05:24.960 --> 05:29.640
It is based on your religion, but the problem would be your religion, not necessarily the

05:29.640 --> 05:30.640
workplace.

05:30.920 --> 05:36.880
Amazon made changes that mainly dealt with issues around practicing Islam, oh boy.

05:36.880 --> 05:41.240
Muslim Amazon workers had no place to pray in the warehouse, and they complained about

05:41.240 --> 05:45.880
not being able to keep up with the job during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, where they

05:45.880 --> 05:47.200
fast until sundown.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.200
Well, is there a church inside an Amazon warehouse?

05:49.200 --> 05:51.360
Do they provide that shit too?

05:51.360 --> 05:55.480
Amazon responded by creating a dedicated prayer space, I'm sure, and said it has been working

05:55.480 --> 05:58.500
to make shifts more manageable during Ramadan.

05:58.500 --> 06:02.420
But employees complain that these moves are like band-aids that address small issues

06:02.420 --> 06:04.180
without tackling the larger problems.

06:04.180 --> 06:06.300
What do you mean?

06:06.300 --> 06:10.180
In my opinion, these are ridiculous things to do, but they directly address the problem.

06:10.180 --> 06:11.980
What more could you want than this?

06:11.980 --> 06:17.260
They give you a dedicated prayer room, and then they ease up on your quotas during Ramadan.

06:17.260 --> 06:19.080
That's literally what you asked for.

06:19.080 --> 06:25.380
During Ramadan, employees have the right to use PTO, personal time off, unpaid time off,

06:25.380 --> 06:29.500
or vacation time if they have time available in their account.

06:29.500 --> 06:34.820
They have to use those banked time allotments for religious holidays, giving them less time

06:34.820 --> 06:39.580
than their non-Muslim co-workers to take off for when their kids are sick.

06:39.580 --> 06:41.660
You don't think that Christians take time off sometimes.

06:41.660 --> 06:44.980
You don't think there might be a Christian working for Amazon who takes Sundays off to

06:44.980 --> 06:45.980
go to church?

06:45.980 --> 06:49.540
You don't think there might be a Christian who works for Amazon who takes time around

06:49.540 --> 06:51.260
Christmas and Easter off?

06:51.260 --> 06:54.480
Unless you're comparing yourself to atheists, in which case you have a point, but that is

06:54.480 --> 06:56.580
what you choose when you follow a religion.

06:56.580 --> 07:01.520
If you want time set aside, you have to have time set aside, and it is entirely fair that

07:01.520 --> 07:05.760
you have an equal amount of time set aside, you're just choosing to use it for religious

07:05.760 --> 07:06.880
purposes.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.880
Amazon said, we work hard every day to ensure all of our employees are treated fairly and

07:10.880 --> 07:15.080
with dignity and respect, including here in Minnesota, where we have an open and direct

07:15.080 --> 07:16.960
dialogue with employees.

07:16.960 --> 07:22.480
Amazon offers a great employment opportunity with excellent pay, ranging from $16.25 an

07:22.480 --> 07:28.920
hour to $20.80 an hour, and comprehensive benefits including healthcare, up to 20 weeks

07:28.920 --> 07:33.840
parental leave, paid education, promotional opportunities, and more.

07:33.840 --> 07:39.020
We encourage anyone to compare our pay, benefits, and workplace to other retailers and major

07:39.020 --> 07:42.320
employers in the community and across the country.

07:42.320 --> 07:46.040
We invite anyone to see for themselves and take a tour through our fulfillment center

07:46.040 --> 07:47.040
tour program.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.040
Well, there you go.

07:48.040 --> 07:53.440
I mean, that's not super amazing pay, but it's certainly better than average.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.820
And it's just for packing boxes.

07:55.820 --> 07:59.520
Regarding its prayer breaks, Amazon told the author of this article that prayer breaks

07:59.520 --> 08:06.560
less than 20 minutes are paid and productivity expectations are not adjusted for such breaks.

08:06.560 --> 08:11.120
Associates are welcome to request an unpaid prayer break for over 20 minutes, for which

08:11.120 --> 08:13.840
productivity expectations would be adjusted.

08:13.840 --> 08:14.840
That sounds fair.

08:14.840 --> 08:19.800
There's obviously the possibility that Amazon might be lying here, but if they're not, they

08:19.800 --> 08:21.600
seem like they're doing an alright job already.

08:21.600 --> 08:26.280
Ibrahim also says that until recently, nearly all Amazon managers in the warehouse were

08:26.280 --> 08:30.640
white, which contributed to the culture gap many African workers perceive in the facility.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.640
Oh, okay.

08:31.640 --> 08:35.560
Everything up until now has mentioned Islam, but now suddenly we're talking about white

08:35.560 --> 08:36.560
people.

08:36.560 --> 08:37.560
It's gone from religion to race.

08:37.560 --> 08:41.360
I don't want to sound like an Amazon apologist here because I know that there's actually

08:41.360 --> 08:49.080
a lot wrong with Amazon, but I think this, this racial religious hodgepodge complaint

08:49.080 --> 08:51.080
is not the place to go with these protests.

08:51.080 --> 08:57.080
But speaking of religion, God wrongfully impregnated teenage Virgin Mary without consent, says

08:57.080 --> 08:59.600
Minnesota professor.

08:59.600 --> 09:04.600
Um, he's, he's not wrong, I guess.

09:04.600 --> 09:11.080
Virgin birth story is unethical abuse of power at best and grossly predatory at worst.

09:11.800 --> 09:16.400
A Minnesota state university professor tweeted this week that Mary, the Virgin could not

09:16.400 --> 09:21.820
have consented the conception of Christ and that God was behaving therefore in a quote

09:21.820 --> 09:23.480
predatory manner.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.520
That professor whose salary is paid for by taxpayers also tweeted himself decorating

09:26.520 --> 09:29.720
a Christmas tree with satanic ornaments.

09:29.720 --> 09:32.560
Have you taken any of his classes, Mark Stein?

09:32.560 --> 09:33.560
No.

09:33.560 --> 09:39.020
And the reason is this is the thing that this is because 50 years ago, this kind of shallow

09:39.060 --> 09:44.260
banality would have been the province of a drunk undergraduate at three in the morning.

09:44.260 --> 09:50.860
Um, I mean, basically the idea that, that God, uh, has gotten the Virgin Mary back to

09:50.860 --> 09:54.040
his pad and she's saying, I really must go.

09:54.040 --> 09:59.060
And he's saying, Oh baby, it's cold outside and put some records on while I pour.

09:59.060 --> 10:07.420
I miss the days when atheists were at least intelligent enough to take seriously what

10:07.420 --> 10:09.220
they were porting to knock down.

10:09.220 --> 10:12.860
I mean, I don't really care about the satanic ornaments on your tree.

10:12.860 --> 10:13.860
Do whatever you want.

10:13.860 --> 10:15.780
But this is really stupid, isn't it?

10:15.780 --> 10:19.920
This professor wrote the Virgin birth story is about an all knowing all powerful deity

10:19.920 --> 10:22.460
impregnating a human teen.

10:22.460 --> 10:23.620
Was was Mary a teen?

10:23.620 --> 10:26.420
I mean, she might've been, it was, it was the ancient times, right?

10:26.420 --> 10:27.720
But whatever.

10:27.720 --> 10:30.260
There was no definition of consent that would include that scenario.

10:30.260 --> 10:31.260
Happy holidays.

10:31.260 --> 10:35.140
He later added the biblical God regularly punished disobedience, the power difference

10:35.140 --> 10:39.460
deity versus mortal and the potential for violence for saying no negates her yes to

10:39.460 --> 10:44.980
put someone in this position isn't an ethical abuse of power at best and grossly predatory

10:44.980 --> 10:45.980
at worst.

10:45.980 --> 10:50.020
The problem is not necessarily with what he's saying because I guess factually, if we're

10:50.020 --> 10:53.260
going just strictly with what he said, he's correct.

10:53.260 --> 10:59.060
However, what he's missing is that you cannot judge yesterday by today's morals.

10:59.060 --> 11:04.260
There are various figures who lived throughout human history that by today's standards would

11:04.260 --> 11:09.140
be considered immoral people, certainly, but by their own standards, they were paragons

11:09.140 --> 11:10.140
of virtue.

11:10.140 --> 11:16.820
And that's because just like any other form of, of advancement, whether it's, it's technological

11:16.820 --> 11:24.740
or artistic advances in politics and philosophy also take time and you can't really judge

11:24.740 --> 11:28.620
somebody living in the past for not living up to today's standards.

11:28.620 --> 11:31.700
They had no concept of, of liberalism.

11:31.700 --> 11:35.980
Some of them, if you go back far enough, there were no concept of universal human rights.

11:35.980 --> 11:40.920
So to take a religious tale that was set in an era 2000 years ago and judge it by today's

11:40.920 --> 11:43.140
morality is, is just stupidity.

11:43.140 --> 11:46.600
However, there is a, there's a link in the middle of this article that says Nebraska

11:46.600 --> 11:51.380
principle bans candy canes because the shape is a J for Jesus.

11:51.380 --> 11:52.660
Let's see what that's all about.

11:52.660 --> 11:57.780
The J shape stands for Jesus according to the blaze, but that was just for starters.

11:57.780 --> 12:01.700
Also on the naughty list were Christmas carols, Christmas music, and making Christmas ornaments

12:01.700 --> 12:02.700
as gifts.

12:02.700 --> 12:05.500
You know, you know, I never really liked candy canes.

12:05.500 --> 12:09.420
There are like strawberry flavored ones that are pretty okay, but the normal ones are just

12:09.420 --> 12:10.420
eh.

12:10.420 --> 12:16.300
A Nebraska elementary school principal named Jennifer Sinclair gave out this list of things

12:16.300 --> 12:20.700
that were not allowed at Manchester elementary school in Omaha.

12:20.700 --> 12:27.660
Santas or Christmas items on worksheets, Christmas trees in the classrooms, elf on the shelf,

12:27.660 --> 12:31.580
bringing Christmas carols, playing Christmas music, sending a scholastic book that is a

12:31.580 --> 12:35.660
Christmas book, making a Christmas ornament as a gift.

12:35.660 --> 12:36.660
Candy canes.

12:36.660 --> 12:38.800
Historically, the shape is a J for Jesus.

12:38.800 --> 12:42.200
The red is for the blood of Christ and the white is a symbol of his resurrection.

12:42.200 --> 12:45.540
Is that, is that actually what a candy cane is all about?

12:45.540 --> 12:46.980
I don't know.

12:46.980 --> 12:47.980
Red and green items.

12:47.980 --> 12:49.500
So nothing red and green.

12:49.500 --> 12:54.900
Those are just off-limits colors, reindeer, Christmas videos, movies, or characters from

12:54.900 --> 12:55.900
Christmas movies.

12:56.260 --> 12:57.260
Just no Christmas.

12:57.260 --> 12:58.260
It's gone.

12:58.260 --> 13:03.340
Sinclair, who's in her first year as Manchester's principal noted in the memo that she comes

13:03.340 --> 13:07.580
from a place that Christmas and the like are not allowed in schools and that as a public

13:07.580 --> 13:12.300
school, Manchester elementary will seek to be inclusive and culturally sensitive to all

13:12.300 --> 13:13.420
of our students.

13:13.420 --> 13:17.420
Make sure those students know to celebrate their generic winter holiday.

13:17.420 --> 13:23.020
And actually I think her, her list of acceptable practices kind of reinforced that idea.

13:23.020 --> 13:25.020
Gifts are okay.

13:25.020 --> 13:26.660
Making gifts are okay.

13:26.660 --> 13:30.580
Snow men, snow women, snow people, snowflakes.

13:30.580 --> 13:34.060
I'm pretty sure the principal is a fucking snowflake.

13:34.060 --> 13:38.380
Gingerbread people, not gingerbread men, according to the, what was it?

13:38.380 --> 13:42.800
Was it Scotland that recently outlawed gingerbread men in favor of gingerbread people?

13:42.800 --> 13:47.220
Holidays around the world, except not Christmas, apparently.

13:47.220 --> 13:50.980
I know that, you know, Christmas is celebrated around the world.

13:50.980 --> 13:54.460
There are Christians around the world, but I guess they don't count.

13:54.460 --> 13:55.460
Sledding is good.

13:55.460 --> 14:01.740
Hot chocolate, polar bears, penguins, scarves, boots, earmuffs, wait, wait, hold on.

14:01.740 --> 14:02.740
Penguins.

14:02.740 --> 14:04.860
They're in the South pole, not the North.

14:04.860 --> 14:06.980
Scarves, boots, earmuffs, and hats.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.180
You don't want them to freeze.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.020
Can't ban those or else the kids will start dying.

14:11.020 --> 14:16.660
Yetis and Olaf from Frozen.

14:16.660 --> 14:20.800
It does seem like sanity has prevailed though, because Liberty council sent a demand letter

14:20.800 --> 14:25.480
to the superintendent about the Christmas ban, urging it to be immediately overruled

14:25.480 --> 14:29.720
and specifically disavowed the sweeping directive banning Christmas holiday items.

14:29.720 --> 14:33.560
And the district's response to Liberty council said that it had investigated the matter and

14:33.560 --> 14:37.200
determined that principal Sinclair's memorandum did not comply with board policy.

14:37.200 --> 14:42.360
And the update shows that the principal has issued an apology, so I guess all's right

14:42.360 --> 14:43.360
in the world.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.800
You know, I'm not even a Christian, right?

14:45.800 --> 14:51.920
But I cannot deny the cultural significance that Christmas has in western society.

14:51.920 --> 14:56.320
I'm not even talking about the religious significance, and I'm sure for religious people there is

14:56.320 --> 15:02.560
a great religious significance, but for non-religious people to simply celebrate Christmas as a

15:02.560 --> 15:07.440
secular holiday, that shouldn't be taken away from them.

15:07.440 --> 15:13.300
Western nations do have a culture all to their own, just like every other nation does, and

15:13.300 --> 15:14.940
we should not be ashamed of it.

15:14.940 --> 15:19.180
We certainly shouldn't think that ours is somehow superior to others, but we shouldn't

15:19.180 --> 15:23.420
be okay with it simply being washed away in the name of political correctness.

15:23.420 --> 15:27.000
Here's some more school nonsense from our old friends over at Breitbart.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.380
Germany launches how to identify Nazi parents guide for schools.

15:30.380 --> 15:36.420
I can see Germany doing this honestly, they're very Nazi-phobic and frankly I don't blame

15:36.420 --> 15:39.060
them considering what happened.

15:39.060 --> 15:45.620
However, a new booklet for daycare workers that claims to help identify Nazi parents

15:45.620 --> 15:50.420
suggests looking out for girls with braided hair and athletic boys.

15:50.420 --> 15:55.740
It's all it takes to be a Nazi nowadays, guys.

15:55.740 --> 15:59.660
If your little girl has her hair braided, her parents are a Nazi, and she's being raised

15:59.660 --> 16:01.740
to be a Nazi.

16:01.740 --> 16:07.700
If the little boy is athletic, if he likes to run around or play a sport at school, Nazi.

16:07.700 --> 16:13.020
People have labeled this booklet that's been handed out as parenting espionage or spying

16:13.020 --> 16:16.800
on parents, and the booklet has been criticized because it identifies the way children dress

16:16.800 --> 16:19.920
or how much physical activity they participate in as being potential signs that their parents

16:19.920 --> 16:20.920
might be Nazis.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.780
The criticism of that does not fit into democracy.

16:22.780 --> 16:25.740
It very clearly does not fit in with fucking democracy.

16:25.740 --> 16:34.260
You can't say, unless they're wearing an actual Nazi uniform, and even then there are reasons

16:34.260 --> 16:40.700
to wear actual Nazi uniforms that don't make you a Nazi, believe it or not, but like how

16:40.700 --> 16:47.780
people dress and how much physical activity they participate in, really, that's what makes

16:47.780 --> 16:48.780
you a Nazi.

16:48.780 --> 16:49.780
You're going to be a weightlifter.

16:49.780 --> 16:50.780
You're a Nazi.

16:50.780 --> 16:51.780
You're going to be a professional sports star.

16:51.780 --> 16:52.780
You're a Nazi.

16:52.780 --> 16:55.320
The foundation that put out these booklets defended it by claiming that the case studies

16:55.320 --> 17:00.220
were based on real life cases they had witnessed, including a girl with braided hair whose parents

17:00.220 --> 17:02.420
turned out to be far-right extremists.

17:02.420 --> 17:07.580
This does not mean that all girls with braided hair are going to have parents that are far-right

17:07.580 --> 17:09.320
extremists.

17:09.320 --> 17:14.560
This is some D&D causes satanic panic shit, all right?

17:14.560 --> 17:20.620
This is some video games cause school shooters gamers rise up bottom text actually shit.

17:20.620 --> 17:25.320
The case studies echo research presented by Antifa groups in 2016, which claimed that

17:25.320 --> 17:30.700
Volkstfamilies, those who believe in countryside living and traditional German culture and

17:30.700 --> 17:33.500
values, posed a threat to Germany.

17:33.500 --> 17:39.260
Anti-fascist action group member Olof Meyer warned of young couples who buy farms and

17:39.260 --> 17:41.900
restore them together with their relatives and friends.

17:41.900 --> 17:43.740
Yeah, this.

17:43.740 --> 17:45.300
This is Nazism, guys.

17:45.300 --> 17:46.300
This is it.

17:46.300 --> 17:48.400
You know, you buy a fixer-upper?

17:48.400 --> 17:50.460
You want to have kids?

17:50.460 --> 17:51.460
You're a fucking Nazi.

17:51.460 --> 17:56.220
Why aren't you participating in the absolute demographic destruction of the native German

17:56.220 --> 17:57.900
population?

17:57.900 --> 18:00.180
Is it because you're a Nazi?

18:00.660 --> 18:01.660
This is so fucking stupid.

18:01.660 --> 18:05.940
Let's learn the politically acceptable way to manipulate your children, according to

18:05.940 --> 18:08.020
the Washington Post anyway.

18:08.020 --> 18:11.060
Parents should encourage girls to get angry and show it.

18:11.060 --> 18:12.060
Here's how.

18:12.060 --> 18:15.580
We are so busy teaching girls to be likable that we forget to teach them that they have

18:15.580 --> 18:19.100
the right to be respected, and the effects of that carry into adulthood.

18:19.100 --> 18:22.700
Women and men experience anger the same way, but men are much more likely to express that

18:22.700 --> 18:25.780
anger verbally, while women tend to keep it to themselves.

18:25.780 --> 18:27.980
In doing so, we lose our ability to defend ourselves.

18:27.980 --> 18:29.580
See, I'm not sure this is the truth.

18:29.580 --> 18:35.660
I remember reading a different study where when adult men are angry, they're more likely

18:35.660 --> 18:41.820
to express it physically, while when adult women are angry, they're more likely to express

18:41.820 --> 18:43.740
it verbally.

18:43.740 --> 18:47.860
They don't yell at people necessarily, though they do that sometimes, and they do get physical

18:47.860 --> 18:53.500
sometimes too, but overwhelmingly women tend to spread rumors, they tend to slander, and

18:53.500 --> 18:56.940
they tend to defame people.

18:56.940 --> 19:04.040
There is a gendered component to how boys and girls, and men and women, let off steam

19:04.040 --> 19:05.040
in this way.

19:05.040 --> 19:09.020
Well, this author is committed to changing that in her home with her girls, ages six

19:09.020 --> 19:10.020
and eleven.

19:10.020 --> 19:11.980
Here's her six-point plan.

19:11.980 --> 19:13.460
Oh boy.

19:13.460 --> 19:16.340
One, share the positive power of anger.

19:16.340 --> 19:22.000
Saying I am angry is a necessary first step to listen, believe me, listen and believe,

19:22.000 --> 19:23.620
trust me, I know.

19:23.620 --> 19:27.300
Time to do something, writes the author in Rage Becomes Her.

19:27.300 --> 19:32.460
Well, here's the thing, simply being angry does not entitle you to something.

19:32.460 --> 19:35.060
You might be angry and still be wrong.

19:35.060 --> 19:40.500
What you're feeling, thinking and saying may matter, but it might also not be factually

19:40.500 --> 19:41.500
correct.

19:41.500 --> 19:47.140
In fact, you might be completely off base, and your anger might be completely unjustified.

19:47.140 --> 19:50.020
That's why people say facts over feels.

19:50.020 --> 19:52.340
This is a completely bullshit article, guys.

19:52.340 --> 19:54.260
Number two, listen to your daughter.

19:54.260 --> 19:57.220
Number three, give her a framework to express it.

19:57.220 --> 19:59.340
Number four, start early.

19:59.340 --> 20:01.800
Number five, help her smash the stereotypes.

20:01.800 --> 20:05.340
And six, express your own anger directly.

20:05.340 --> 20:09.700
Here's a general rule of thumb, and it applies to people of all ages, it applies to people

20:09.700 --> 20:10.700
of all genders.

20:10.700 --> 20:15.300
If you're angry, that means that you thought something was going to turn out one way, and

20:15.300 --> 20:16.980
in fact turned out another way.

20:16.980 --> 20:21.300
Something unexpected has appeared within your field of view.

20:21.300 --> 20:25.500
And the first thing you need to do is take stock of yourself, because sometimes your

20:25.500 --> 20:33.060
anger is because you've laid out a road map, and now you've realized that a tree has fallen

20:33.060 --> 20:36.600
on the road, and now you have to try to find a way around it.

20:36.600 --> 20:40.540
And most of the time, rather than getting angry, you can just find a way around it.

20:40.540 --> 20:46.060
I would say overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly over the course of your life, if you're angry,

20:46.060 --> 20:49.940
there's something you can tweak within yourself that will fix it.

20:49.940 --> 20:51.680
And it might even be your fault.

20:51.680 --> 20:56.140
It's not really important to have your anger validated or whatever feely bullshit this

20:56.140 --> 20:57.780
article is talking about.

20:57.780 --> 20:59.540
What's important is what you do about it.

20:59.540 --> 21:03.120
And the first step is to always take stock of yourself.

21:03.120 --> 21:07.500
And as I said, that advice applies to all genders, all 33 of them, in fact, according

21:07.500 --> 21:13.980
to the Australian government, omnigender, neutrois, whatever the fuck that is, and intersex.

21:13.980 --> 21:18.900
Australians to choose from 33 different gender labels for passports and birth certificates

21:18.900 --> 21:23.620
under radical new labor proposal.

21:23.620 --> 21:25.260
I want to see this list.

21:25.260 --> 21:29.140
I hope the list is in the article because I want to read this shit.

21:29.140 --> 21:33.760
Demigender is also among the 33 labels that will be discussed at the party's upcoming

21:33.760 --> 21:40.500
national conference and could soon be seen printed on passports and birth certificates.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.860
Let's see if this link contains the list.

21:41.860 --> 21:43.340
I want to read it off right now.

21:43.340 --> 21:44.340
I've got to log in.

21:44.340 --> 21:45.340
Fuck that.

21:45.340 --> 21:49.020
The proposal argues that transgender and intersex people would be able to enjoy equal human

21:49.020 --> 21:52.860
rights without discrimination with the additional gender options.

21:52.860 --> 21:57.780
The party would also look at promoting options beyond binary male and female.

21:57.780 --> 22:02.140
And then here's a picture of someone writing in by sex as their selection.

22:02.140 --> 22:06.660
From what I know about biology, which is honestly not much, I think there's like a grand total

22:06.660 --> 22:11.300
of 12 various deformities that can happen.

22:11.300 --> 22:16.060
It'll put you somewhere between male and female biologically, you know, various combinations

22:16.060 --> 22:17.060
of nonfunctioning genitals.

22:17.060 --> 22:22.800
And in fact, but these are like less than 1% of the population, like significantly less

22:22.800 --> 22:25.180
than 1% of the fucking population.

22:25.180 --> 22:33.780
So you have, I guess, a grand total of 14 genders where most are male and female.

22:33.780 --> 22:40.260
And then an extreme minority is one of these 12 various disorders.

22:40.260 --> 22:45.300
Because transgender people, for the most part, they want to be the gender that they're choosing.

22:45.300 --> 22:49.440
You know, they don't want to be somewhere in between, you know, like if it's a male

22:49.440 --> 22:53.460
to female transsexual person, they want to be female.

22:53.460 --> 22:56.780
Okay, I've got the 33 guys, let's go through them.

22:56.780 --> 23:05.140
A woman, a man, a transgender man, a transgender woman, a trans person, a trans man, a trans

23:05.140 --> 23:06.140
woman.

23:06.140 --> 23:12.380
Wait, isn't that just transgender man and transgender woman, but just shortened to trans

23:12.380 --> 23:15.020
man and trans woman?

23:15.020 --> 23:24.980
Female to male, male to female, transsexual, okay, these are just like these, this group

23:24.980 --> 23:31.040
here are just rephrasing the exact same phenomenon, all of these ones.

23:31.040 --> 23:40.940
A cisgender person, cisfemale, cismale, that's just woman to man, again.

23:40.940 --> 23:47.080
Gender non-conforming, non-gender, okay, so, alright.

23:47.080 --> 23:54.280
A non-binary person, neutrois, neutrois is a non-binary gender identity which is considered

23:54.280 --> 23:58.800
to be a neutral or null gender, isn't that the same thing with non-gender, isn't that

23:58.800 --> 24:02.560
what non-gender is, isn't that the same thing?

24:02.560 --> 24:06.640
Okay, gender fluid, a person who does not identify entirely with either the male or

24:06.640 --> 24:12.040
female genders, isn't that the same thing as non-binary?

24:12.040 --> 24:20.560
Gender queer, again, it's the same description, demigender, this term, demi means half, is

24:20.560 --> 24:26.160
an umbrella term for non-binary, okay, you're even using non-binary, something that you've

24:26.160 --> 24:33.640
already defined up here in this definition, this is this, there's a demi girl, can also

24:33.640 --> 24:39.360
be called a demi woman or a demi female, and there's also a demi boy, and they identify

24:39.360 --> 24:44.600
partially, only partially, so that's kind of like a non-binary somewhere on the spectrum,

24:44.600 --> 24:49.600
considering that demi means half, maybe this is just like half a person, maybe they lost

24:49.600 --> 24:54.240
their legs in an accident or something, here we go, we got agender, this literally means

24:54.240 --> 25:02.720
it without gender, isn't that neutroized, that's what this is, isn't it, just no gender,

25:02.720 --> 25:09.400
you could just be agender as in a single one, agender, intergender, intergender people have

25:09.400 --> 25:13.040
a gender identity that is in the middle, between the binary and gender, okay, these are all

25:13.040 --> 25:17.960
rephrasing of the same thing, like I don't feel like a guy, I don't feel like a girl,

25:17.960 --> 25:22.320
I'm in the middle somewhere, you know, I flipped the coin and it landed on its edge, that's

25:22.320 --> 25:26.000
what all these mean, that's what all of these mean, and they're just rephrasing the same

25:26.000 --> 25:29.680
fucking concept over and over, here's something that's actually different and has a grounding

25:29.680 --> 25:34.440
in biology, intersex, a person who is born with a reproductive anatomy of both a man

25:34.440 --> 25:43.640
and a woman, so we're talking about deformities here, you know, there are people who are born

25:43.640 --> 25:47.920
with like a penis but it's like non-functioning and it's just a facade, right, and like underneath

25:47.920 --> 25:52.480
it you have nothing, sometimes underneath it you have like a uterus that's like closed off,

25:52.480 --> 25:56.280
and there are also other various deformities possible, I think I mentioned earlier that it

25:56.280 --> 26:01.360
was about 12 of them that have been identified very strictly, this is where the whole idea of

26:01.360 --> 26:07.720
the fucking Japanese Fudanari comes from, where you get like a woman but they have like a fully

26:07.720 --> 26:13.100
functioning penis attached to the top of their vagina where a clit would be, that type of

26:13.100 --> 26:18.420
intersex person is extremely rare, as far as I know, I guess they are like one in a billion

26:18.420 --> 26:21.740
though so I guess they're out there somewhere, these people were previously referred to as

26:21.740 --> 26:26.820
hermaphrodites but that term is considered rude and outdated, okay fine, here's something that

26:26.820 --> 26:33.260
might actually need some kind of clarification on a passport for real, you finally found one on

26:33.260 --> 26:40.380
this fucking list that is an exception to the rule, okay, uh, pangender, person who identifies

26:40.380 --> 26:47.220
as more than one gender, okay, we're back to the bullshit, polygender translates to many genders,

26:47.220 --> 26:54.860
a person who identifies as more than one gender, same thing as this, omnigender translates to all

26:54.860 --> 27:01.300
genders, a person identifies as more than one gender, all the same thing, bigender translates

27:01.300 --> 27:06.500
to two genders, a person identifies as both male and female genders, some bigender people have two

27:06.500 --> 27:12.820
distinct male and female personas that's called like multiple personality disorder

27:12.820 --> 27:16.540
that's having a split personality your problems if you're if you're in this

27:16.540 --> 27:22.260
camp your problems go far beyond anything to do with gender androgyne a

27:22.260 --> 27:25.860
person who doesn't identify with either gender they are both feminine and

27:25.860 --> 27:32.020
masculine androgyny is is just it's the same as androgyne they're the same root

27:32.020 --> 27:37.700
this is a person and this is a quality third gender I understand that some

27:37.700 --> 27:43.380
cultures do have a third gender option within them in their in their religious

27:43.380 --> 27:49.420
and cultural practices and and fair enough fine here you go there's your

27:49.420 --> 27:52.900
third gender for your passport try gender a person who shifts between the

27:52.900 --> 27:57.940
male female and a third genders okay so so what are the actual legitimate ones

27:57.940 --> 28:03.540
on this list okay we got let's go to the top we got a you got male you got

28:03.540 --> 28:08.100
woman a man we've got the two transgender possibilities where it's a

28:08.100 --> 28:14.380
male to female and female to male there's four you've got maybe like we'll

28:14.380 --> 28:18.100
have like one for the non gender when you just have zero gender completely

28:18.100 --> 28:24.380
okay there's five you've got intersex for the various deformities and and and

28:24.380 --> 28:28.740
very various biological things that can happen there's six and then you have the

28:28.740 --> 28:32.500
third gender for those cultures that have that there's seven okay okay I

28:32.500 --> 28:37.380
think we can work it out now if you really want to include everything and be

28:37.380 --> 28:43.780
as illogical as you can about it seven genders it's more than two and it does

28:43.780 --> 28:48.740
cover everything and it doesn't appeal to all these ridiculous fucking people

28:48.740 --> 28:52.780
who want to feel special about it I do have two more articles left however I'm

28:52.780 --> 28:55.860
deciding to cut it short because after reading them I think they're actually

28:55.860 --> 29:00.660
worth their own video so maybe I'll put that that out this week sometime thank

29:00.660 --> 29:04.180

29:04.180 --> 29:08.140

29:28.260 --> 29:31.620
