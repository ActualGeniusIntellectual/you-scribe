00:00.000 --> 00:09.200
Hey! Did you know that everyone is gay for Bridget? Yeah, that's a really old meme.

00:09.200 --> 00:11.040
If you're a Zoomer, you're not going to know the deep lore.

00:11.040 --> 00:15.920
In 2002, the fighting game Guilty Gear XX came out, adding to the roster what is undoubtedly

00:15.920 --> 00:18.760
the series' most famous character, Bridget.

00:18.760 --> 00:22.240
The TLDR of the story is, Bridget was born in a village with a superstition that frowned

00:22.240 --> 00:26.480
upon same-sex twins. So in order to avoid getting cursed, Bridget was raised as a girl

00:26.480 --> 00:27.600
by his parents.

00:27.600 --> 00:31.720
When he became old enough, he ran away, became a bounty hunter, and desired to return home

00:31.720 --> 00:35.840
one day after becoming successful, to prove to his parents that the superstition was false.

00:35.840 --> 00:40.000
But as a result of his upbringing, he looks, acts, and sounds quite feminine.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Bridget is the origin of the term trap. Yeah, from 20 years ago. The whole point of the

00:44.000 --> 00:47.340
character is that everybody thinks he's a girl, but he's not. And this was generally

00:47.340 --> 00:51.320
played for laughs and Guilty Gear, with straight men becoming embarrassed for their attraction

00:51.320 --> 00:52.320
to him.

00:52.320 --> 00:57.080
The 2000s saw a lot of Bridget fan porn, both men and women cosplaying as him. The Everybody's

00:57.080 --> 01:01.200
Gay for Bridget meme highlighting his ability to attract and confuse straight men, as well

01:01.200 --> 01:05.400
as the Dropped a Bridget on Him saying, which refers to a shocking gender reveal scene in

01:05.400 --> 01:06.400
a piece of media.

01:06.400 --> 01:10.520
The name Dropped a Bridget on Him is a cross between, well, Bridget, and the saying Dropped

01:10.520 --> 01:14.000
a Bridge on Him, which is a trope where a character is written out of a story and given

01:14.000 --> 01:18.120
an unceremonious quick death to get it over with, often because the actor left the show.

01:18.120 --> 01:22.200
Despite this, the phrase Dropped a Bridge on Him comes from Captain Kirk's death in

01:22.200 --> 01:26.960
Star Trek Generations, which wasn't unceremonious or quick, but was still a little bit odd.

01:26.960 --> 01:28.680
Nobody expected him to die like a redshirt.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.760
In any case, Bridget is a trap. You're gay for liking Bridget.

01:31.760 --> 01:36.120
This stuff permeated 2000s era internet culture, and it was one of the first real instances

01:36.120 --> 01:40.800
of acceptance of the idea of what we would now call gender nonconformity, at least among

01:40.800 --> 01:43.680
males. We had tomboys before, yeah, but nothing for men.

01:43.680 --> 01:47.600
It might be teasing and kinda rude, but that was the nature of acceptance back in the day.

01:47.600 --> 01:51.000
Everybody takes their lumps to become a part of the crowd, and Bridget was a fan favorite,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.380
specifically because of how the character played with gender.

01:53.380 --> 01:57.980
In an interview in Anime Expo in 2009, the creator of Bridget, Daisuke Ishiwatari, was

01:57.980 --> 02:01.700
asked if he anticipated Bridget's popularity. This was his reply through a translator.

02:01.700 --> 02:04.980
There were already other good-looking and tough characters, so I added a cute character.

02:04.980 --> 02:08.660
However, a lot of fighting games already had the token cute character, so I wanted something

02:08.660 --> 02:11.000
unconventional. So I made a cute character that's a guy.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.020
The big surprise was that it didn't matter. Bridget still has a huge following.

02:14.020 --> 02:16.920
There's nothing here about representation or whatever, it was just done on a whim, because

02:16.920 --> 02:19.980
it was interesting and new. I can respect that. Make whatever you want to make.

02:19.980 --> 02:23.980
But the recent shit show about Bridget is that he was added into the latest game, Guilty

02:23.980 --> 02:28.980
Gear Strive, as a DLC character. And there are a lot of very loud, vocal individuals

02:28.980 --> 02:33.060
online right now, insisting that Bridget is not a trap, or a femboy, or any other sort

02:33.060 --> 02:37.780
of feminine man, but is in fact a trans woman. And they use these clips from the English

02:37.780 --> 02:38.980
version of the game to say so

03:08.980 --> 03:33.280
Fair enough. That sounds a lot like Bridget is dejected when he says I'm a boy, and is

03:33.280 --> 03:38.260
very happy, like a weight is off his shoulders, when he says girl is fine because I'm a girl.

03:38.260 --> 03:41.700
This is being treated as Bridget's coming out moment. Bridget is trans guys. If you

03:41.700 --> 03:44.980
spread any of those old memes around, you're a transphobic bigot. We're going to lock

03:44.980 --> 03:48.220
down the Guilty Gear wiki and prevent anybody from talking about it, because Bridget is

03:48.220 --> 03:52.060
trans and the person who's an admin on the site is also trans. Also if you have any complaints

03:52.060 --> 03:56.420
about any of this, you're a nerdy man baby who is worrying too much about fictional characters,

03:56.420 --> 03:59.720
and the world is changing and leaving you behind. Well, yeah it actually doesn't matter

03:59.720 --> 04:03.540
if people make Bridget trans or not, it is just a game. Just like the pride flag in Spider-Man

04:03.540 --> 04:04.980
is also just a game.

04:04.980 --> 04:09.200
But when somebody draws Black Panther as a white man, or posts an old image of Bridget

04:09.200 --> 04:14.260
being a trap, these people scream bloody fucking murder. So clearly they think it matters,

04:14.260 --> 04:17.660
and they're hoping you will take the bait of it doesn't matter, so that they can do

04:17.660 --> 04:19.460
what they like without any pushback.

04:19.460 --> 04:22.460
More importantly, let's examine the actual situation here. People are saying that the

04:22.460 --> 04:25.980
Bridget comes out as a girl scene is from a bad ending and therefore we should laugh

04:25.980 --> 04:29.740
at the people who consider this to be canon. That's actually not true. In Guilty Gear,

04:29.740 --> 04:33.560
the endings in Arcade mode are all canon. They each reveal a different part of the story,

04:33.560 --> 04:36.620
but none of them actually overwrite each other. For example, Bridget's three endings

04:36.620 --> 04:40.800
in Guilty Gear XX each tell a different story, where Bridget brings a reward back to the

04:40.800 --> 04:44.780
village, where Bridget befriends the jellyfish pirates, and where Bridget is hit on by Johnny.

04:44.780 --> 04:48.200
But in the next game, it's canon that all three of these endings happened, and none

04:48.200 --> 04:51.720
of them actually prevent the others from being true and some kind of consistency problem.

04:51.720 --> 04:55.200
This is how the games are written. Each ending provides a different story point, and to get

04:55.200 --> 04:58.600
the full story you watch all of the endings. And some people are using the clips where

04:58.600 --> 05:01.920
Bridget says I'm a boy to counteract the clips where Bridget says I'm a girl. And

05:01.920 --> 05:06.160
at that point it's just cherry picking what you want to hear. But nonetheless, I still

05:06.160 --> 05:10.400
don't think that Bridget is trans or a woman. I do think that Bridget is still the same

05:10.400 --> 05:14.800
femboy trap he's always been. And here's why. The Japanese internet, and more importantly

05:14.800 --> 05:19.360
ArcSys in Japan, still refers to him as a boy. In Japanese, he's specifically referred

05:19.360 --> 05:24.180
to as an otokonoko. Yeah, y'all knew this word was coming. It means male daughter. Otokonoko

05:24.180 --> 05:29.480
is a type of gender nonconformity unique to Japan, but it's explicitly not trans. Otokonokos

05:29.480 --> 05:33.080
are still men, they're just feminine men. They've adopted a feminine role, but they

05:33.080 --> 05:36.840
don't consider themselves women. And while the English version of Bridget's final line

05:36.840 --> 05:53.340
is translated as a triumphant coming out moment, the Japanese one has added context. Otokonoko

05:53.340 --> 05:58.440
will often refer to themselves as girls, specifically in this type of playful way, not because they

05:58.440 --> 06:02.880
actually consider themselves girls, but more as a playful aesthetic flourish. And there's

06:02.880 --> 06:06.880
probably a few weirdos out there who will say that this point is cope, she's obviously

06:06.880 --> 06:11.480
trans. But you know, this actually happens regularly outside of Japan. How often do gay

06:11.480 --> 06:16.640
effeminate men call themselves, or other gay effeminate men, girl? How often do drag queens

06:16.640 --> 06:21.640
refer to themselves as girls, or ladies, or queens, obviously? None of this is an expression

06:21.640 --> 06:26.480
of transness, of the desire to be a different physical sex, or of gender dysphoria. It's

06:26.480 --> 06:30.240
all playful expressions of gender nonconformity. People are even saying that because the symbol

06:30.240 --> 06:34.020
on Bridget's design was changed from a male one, that's got to be proof that he's trans.

06:34.020 --> 06:38.800
But this isn't the trans symbol, it's the androgyny symbol which Otokonokos use in Japan.

06:38.800 --> 06:42.920
A lot of the woke's gold replies to these points have an undercurrent of the idea that

06:42.920 --> 06:48.560
Japanese people don't know how to do transness correctly, and that being Otokonoko is being

06:48.560 --> 06:53.240
trans, even if both the Otokonokos themselves and the culture that spawned the idea disagrees.

06:53.240 --> 06:57.120
At that point it feels like it's not about representation, but about cultural colonization.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.720
And that's because it is! Let me show you how.

06:59.720 --> 07:04.320
Lilith nailed it on the head back in 2018, when she tweeted this now-deleted banger.

07:04.320 --> 07:08.560
In just half a decade, anime traps and dick girls have done more for the normalization

07:08.560 --> 07:12.840
and popularization of feminine boys and trans women within the western zeitgeist than social

07:12.840 --> 07:16.960
justice has since its inception. She nuked the tweet because the trans activists and

07:16.960 --> 07:21.360
woke's golds were raging like mad at her. But this is a true statement. Bridget's

07:21.360 --> 07:24.720
gold popularity and the current fan backlash can attest to that.

07:24.720 --> 07:29.080
While Bridget was portrayed as a trap back in the day, testament from the same game series

07:29.080 --> 07:34.120
was basically non-binary or some flavor of genderless before that was even a thing. In

07:34.120 --> 07:39.120
earlier games he was portrayed as an androgynous man. People used he and him to refer to him,

07:39.120 --> 07:43.520
and he was male, but he was more than happy looking and behaving like he was in between.

07:43.520 --> 07:48.080
But in modern games he's been revisioned due to an in-story event which actually made

07:48.080 --> 07:52.000
him biologically sexless. And yeah there was a little bit of fan backlash when this

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
happened too.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.240
I think what's happening here is that people just like the idea of playing with gender

07:57.240 --> 08:01.880
outside of the bounds of transness. There's a lot of gender stuff out there that isn't

08:01.880 --> 08:07.760
strictly hyper-masculine or hyper-feminine that at one point existed separate from transness.

08:07.760 --> 08:12.500
And the people who both liked those characters and viewed themselves in that way in real

08:12.500 --> 08:16.560
life also preferred existing outside of the trans sphere.

08:16.560 --> 08:20.600
But in recent years there's been a concerted cultural push to make everything that isn't

08:20.600 --> 08:25.240
strictly man or woman trans, and that's not good. In other words, you can't have a feminine

08:25.240 --> 08:29.040
male character anymore without the trans lobby demanding they be trans. And yeah they don't

08:29.040 --> 08:31.600
actually care about Bridget or Testameter Guilty Gear.

08:31.600 --> 08:35.800
My friend Dimitri Munro, who's actually a femboy IRL, does a lot of good videos on this

08:35.800 --> 08:39.820
topic way more in-depth than me, but we can scratch the surface here for our purposes.

08:39.820 --> 08:44.400
The manga I Think I Turned My Childhood Friend Into a Girl took that girl character, who

08:44.400 --> 08:48.080
is an otokonoko in the original, and the plot, which was about two gay men falling

08:48.080 --> 08:52.220
in love, one of whom was a trap, and through translation shenanigans, in English rewrote

08:52.220 --> 08:56.580
the story to be about a trans woman. Or how Naoto in Persona 4 is a tomboy who wants to

08:56.580 --> 09:00.280
exude a tough presence because she's entering into a male-dominated profession, and she

09:00.280 --> 09:03.080
was rewritten by English translators to be a trans man.

09:03.080 --> 09:07.240
The most striking example is probably the most famous trap after Bridget, a Stolfo from

09:07.240 --> 09:12.000
Fate. He explicitly says I am a man multiple times despite looking and acting girly, and

09:12.000 --> 09:17.800
yet he's often considered a symbol of anti-transness online, simply because he's not trans.

09:17.800 --> 09:21.880
The word trap is considered a slur against trans people, which is why the Are Traps Gay

09:21.880 --> 09:25.940
kerfuffle from years ago was a thing. And when femboy began to replace trap as a word

09:25.940 --> 09:30.320
used to describe feminine men, femboy began to be considered a slur in the same way. The

09:30.320 --> 09:33.920
ethic that these people are operating under is, if you're not a traditionally masculine

09:33.920 --> 09:38.520
man or feminine woman, if you're playing with gender in any way, you have to be trans,

09:38.520 --> 09:41.800
or else you're offensive to trans people. What's really behind it, though, is simply

09:41.800 --> 09:44.520
craving the cultural power that comes with representation.

09:44.520 --> 09:48.600
The reason a Stolfo is the most striking example for our purposes is because Fate actually

09:48.600 --> 09:52.520
has trans characters already, who are pretty good representation for that demographic.

09:52.520 --> 09:56.480
But a Stolfo is popular. He's the face of the series, and so they want him. It's not

09:56.480 --> 09:59.560
for representation's sake. If it were, they would know who they're already represented

09:59.560 --> 10:03.960
by. It's for cultural colonization. It's for the cultural power that comes with the representation

10:03.960 --> 10:08.420
being pushed front and center. And their pursuing this power makes for some, uh, really weird

10:08.420 --> 10:11.260
scenarios. For example, in Cowboy Bebop, the character

10:11.260 --> 10:15.360
of Gren is a former super soldier, who, as a side effect of the drugs he was given to

10:15.360 --> 10:19.160
become a super soldier, has grown breasts. But he's still a man, and his arc in the

10:19.160 --> 10:23.460
show deals with his PTSD, how his society basically sacrificed their veterans and threw

10:23.460 --> 10:27.300
them away. And when he's mistaken for a woman or insulted by being called one, there's

10:27.300 --> 10:31.180
a lot attached to that. But in the god-awful live-action Cowboy Bebop

10:31.180 --> 10:36.340
show, Gren is reimagined as a proud, out, flamboyant, non-binary character. If the message

10:36.340 --> 10:40.300
is that you can be abused and mistreated into gender non-conformity, that's not a

10:40.300 --> 10:44.220
very positive way of looking at this topic. In fact, that's the weirdest thing about

10:44.220 --> 10:48.300
this whole Bridget controversy. Terminally online twitteroids who are demanding that

10:48.300 --> 10:52.220
Bridget is trans. You gotta know what this means, right? It means that Bridget is literally

10:52.220 --> 10:56.380
a grooming victim. You could post him on Libs of TikTok and they'd actually be completely

10:56.380 --> 11:00.500
correct for once. His story is that he was forced to be a girl by his parents to prevent

11:00.500 --> 11:04.620
a religious superstition. And his entire arc is trying to get away from that life. Where

11:04.620 --> 11:09.580
exactly is the positivity about Bridget being trans? Are you really okay with your trans

11:09.580 --> 11:14.240
representation being a person who was socialized and tortured into being trans? Aren't you

11:14.240 --> 11:18.220
just giving ammo to the conversion therapy fucks who want to do the same to you to make

11:18.220 --> 11:22.380
you the other gender too? It seems like the online trans activists can't help but shoot

11:22.380 --> 11:26.500
themselves in the foot every time this happens. This Bridget stuff was funny, and yeah, at

11:26.500 --> 11:30.540
the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. If ArcSIS comes out and directly says, yes,

11:30.540 --> 11:34.420
Bridget is trans, fine, it's just a game. These people still seem unhinged that this

11:34.420 --> 11:38.560
is the story they want. Oh well, at least it made going back and watching old Markiplier

11:38.560 --> 12:02.600
videos have a bit of an extra edge to them.

12:02.600 --> 12:21.080
Are traps gay?
