0	9200	Hey! Did you know that everyone is gay for Bridget? Yeah, that's a really old meme.
9200	11040	If you're a Zoomer, you're not going to know the deep lore.
11040	15920	In 2002, the fighting game Guilty Gear XX came out, adding to the roster what is undoubtedly
15920	18760	the series' most famous character, Bridget.
18760	22240	The TLDR of the story is, Bridget was born in a village with a superstition that frowned
22240	26480	upon same-sex twins. So in order to avoid getting cursed, Bridget was raised as a girl
26480	27600	by his parents.
27600	31720	When he became old enough, he ran away, became a bounty hunter, and desired to return home
31720	35840	one day after becoming successful, to prove to his parents that the superstition was false.
35840	40000	But as a result of his upbringing, he looks, acts, and sounds quite feminine.
40000	44000	Bridget is the origin of the term trap. Yeah, from 20 years ago. The whole point of the
44000	47340	character is that everybody thinks he's a girl, but he's not. And this was generally
47340	51320	played for laughs and Guilty Gear, with straight men becoming embarrassed for their attraction
51320	52320	to him.
52320	57080	The 2000s saw a lot of Bridget fan porn, both men and women cosplaying as him. The Everybody's
57080	61200	Gay for Bridget meme highlighting his ability to attract and confuse straight men, as well
61200	65400	as the Dropped a Bridget on Him saying, which refers to a shocking gender reveal scene in
65400	66400	a piece of media.
66400	70520	The name Dropped a Bridget on Him is a cross between, well, Bridget, and the saying Dropped
70520	74000	a Bridge on Him, which is a trope where a character is written out of a story and given
74000	78120	an unceremonious quick death to get it over with, often because the actor left the show.
78120	82200	Despite this, the phrase Dropped a Bridge on Him comes from Captain Kirk's death in
82200	86960	Star Trek Generations, which wasn't unceremonious or quick, but was still a little bit odd.
86960	88680	Nobody expected him to die like a redshirt.
88680	91760	In any case, Bridget is a trap. You're gay for liking Bridget.
91760	96120	This stuff permeated 2000s era internet culture, and it was one of the first real instances
96120	100800	of acceptance of the idea of what we would now call gender nonconformity, at least among
100800	103680	males. We had tomboys before, yeah, but nothing for men.
103680	107600	It might be teasing and kinda rude, but that was the nature of acceptance back in the day.
107600	111000	Everybody takes their lumps to become a part of the crowd, and Bridget was a fan favorite,
111000	113380	specifically because of how the character played with gender.
113380	117980	In an interview in Anime Expo in 2009, the creator of Bridget, Daisuke Ishiwatari, was
117980	121700	asked if he anticipated Bridget's popularity. This was his reply through a translator.
121700	124980	There were already other good-looking and tough characters, so I added a cute character.
124980	128660	However, a lot of fighting games already had the token cute character, so I wanted something
128660	131000	unconventional. So I made a cute character that's a guy.
131000	134020	The big surprise was that it didn't matter. Bridget still has a huge following.
134020	136920	There's nothing here about representation or whatever, it was just done on a whim, because
136920	139980	it was interesting and new. I can respect that. Make whatever you want to make.
139980	143980	But the recent shit show about Bridget is that he was added into the latest game, Guilty
143980	148980	Gear Strive, as a DLC character. And there are a lot of very loud, vocal individuals
148980	153060	online right now, insisting that Bridget is not a trap, or a femboy, or any other sort
153060	157780	of feminine man, but is in fact a trans woman. And they use these clips from the English
157780	158980	version of the game to say so
188980	213280	Fair enough. That sounds a lot like Bridget is dejected when he says I'm a boy, and is
213280	218260	very happy, like a weight is off his shoulders, when he says girl is fine because I'm a girl.
218260	221700	This is being treated as Bridget's coming out moment. Bridget is trans guys. If you
221700	224980	spread any of those old memes around, you're a transphobic bigot. We're going to lock
224980	228220	down the Guilty Gear wiki and prevent anybody from talking about it, because Bridget is
228220	232060	trans and the person who's an admin on the site is also trans. Also if you have any complaints
232060	236420	about any of this, you're a nerdy man baby who is worrying too much about fictional characters,
236420	239720	and the world is changing and leaving you behind. Well, yeah it actually doesn't matter
239720	243540	if people make Bridget trans or not, it is just a game. Just like the pride flag in Spider-Man
243540	244980	is also just a game.
244980	249200	But when somebody draws Black Panther as a white man, or posts an old image of Bridget
249200	254260	being a trap, these people scream bloody fucking murder. So clearly they think it matters,
254260	257660	and they're hoping you will take the bait of it doesn't matter, so that they can do
257660	259460	what they like without any pushback.
259460	262460	More importantly, let's examine the actual situation here. People are saying that the
262460	265980	Bridget comes out as a girl scene is from a bad ending and therefore we should laugh
265980	269740	at the people who consider this to be canon. That's actually not true. In Guilty Gear,
269740	273560	the endings in Arcade mode are all canon. They each reveal a different part of the story,
273560	276620	but none of them actually overwrite each other. For example, Bridget's three endings
276620	280800	in Guilty Gear XX each tell a different story, where Bridget brings a reward back to the
280800	284780	village, where Bridget befriends the jellyfish pirates, and where Bridget is hit on by Johnny.
284780	288200	But in the next game, it's canon that all three of these endings happened, and none
288200	291720	of them actually prevent the others from being true and some kind of consistency problem.
291720	295200	This is how the games are written. Each ending provides a different story point, and to get
295200	298600	the full story you watch all of the endings. And some people are using the clips where
298600	301920	Bridget says I'm a boy to counteract the clips where Bridget says I'm a girl. And
301920	306160	at that point it's just cherry picking what you want to hear. But nonetheless, I still
306160	310400	don't think that Bridget is trans or a woman. I do think that Bridget is still the same
310400	314800	femboy trap he's always been. And here's why. The Japanese internet, and more importantly
314800	319360	ArcSys in Japan, still refers to him as a boy. In Japanese, he's specifically referred
319360	324180	to as an otokonoko. Yeah, y'all knew this word was coming. It means male daughter. Otokonoko
324180	329480	is a type of gender nonconformity unique to Japan, but it's explicitly not trans. Otokonokos
329480	333080	are still men, they're just feminine men. They've adopted a feminine role, but they
333080	336840	don't consider themselves women. And while the English version of Bridget's final line
336840	353340	is translated as a triumphant coming out moment, the Japanese one has added context. Otokonoko
353340	358440	will often refer to themselves as girls, specifically in this type of playful way, not because they
358440	362880	actually consider themselves girls, but more as a playful aesthetic flourish. And there's
362880	366880	probably a few weirdos out there who will say that this point is cope, she's obviously
366880	371480	trans. But you know, this actually happens regularly outside of Japan. How often do gay
371480	376640	effeminate men call themselves, or other gay effeminate men, girl? How often do drag queens
376640	381640	refer to themselves as girls, or ladies, or queens, obviously? None of this is an expression
381640	386480	of transness, of the desire to be a different physical sex, or of gender dysphoria. It's
386480	390240	all playful expressions of gender nonconformity. People are even saying that because the symbol
390240	394020	on Bridget's design was changed from a male one, that's got to be proof that he's trans.
394020	398800	But this isn't the trans symbol, it's the androgyny symbol which Otokonokos use in Japan.
398800	402920	A lot of the woke's gold replies to these points have an undercurrent of the idea that
402920	408560	Japanese people don't know how to do transness correctly, and that being Otokonoko is being
408560	413240	trans, even if both the Otokonokos themselves and the culture that spawned the idea disagrees.
413240	417120	At that point it feels like it's not about representation, but about cultural colonization.
417120	419720	And that's because it is! Let me show you how.
419720	424320	Lilith nailed it on the head back in 2018, when she tweeted this now-deleted banger.
424320	428560	In just half a decade, anime traps and dick girls have done more for the normalization
428560	432840	and popularization of feminine boys and trans women within the western zeitgeist than social
432840	436960	justice has since its inception. She nuked the tweet because the trans activists and
436960	441360	woke's golds were raging like mad at her. But this is a true statement. Bridget's
441360	444720	gold popularity and the current fan backlash can attest to that.
444720	449080	While Bridget was portrayed as a trap back in the day, testament from the same game series
449080	454120	was basically non-binary or some flavor of genderless before that was even a thing. In
454120	459120	earlier games he was portrayed as an androgynous man. People used he and him to refer to him,
459120	463520	and he was male, but he was more than happy looking and behaving like he was in between.
463520	468080	But in modern games he's been revisioned due to an in-story event which actually made
468080	472000	him biologically sexless. And yeah there was a little bit of fan backlash when this
472000	473000	happened too.
473000	477240	I think what's happening here is that people just like the idea of playing with gender
477240	481880	outside of the bounds of transness. There's a lot of gender stuff out there that isn't
481880	487760	strictly hyper-masculine or hyper-feminine that at one point existed separate from transness.
487760	492500	And the people who both liked those characters and viewed themselves in that way in real
492500	496560	life also preferred existing outside of the trans sphere.
496560	500600	But in recent years there's been a concerted cultural push to make everything that isn't
500600	505240	strictly man or woman trans, and that's not good. In other words, you can't have a feminine
505240	509040	male character anymore without the trans lobby demanding they be trans. And yeah they don't
509040	511600	actually care about Bridget or Testameter Guilty Gear.
511600	515800	My friend Dimitri Munro, who's actually a femboy IRL, does a lot of good videos on this
515800	519820	topic way more in-depth than me, but we can scratch the surface here for our purposes.
519820	524400	The manga I Think I Turned My Childhood Friend Into a Girl took that girl character, who
524400	528080	is an otokonoko in the original, and the plot, which was about two gay men falling
528080	532220	in love, one of whom was a trap, and through translation shenanigans, in English rewrote
532220	536580	the story to be about a trans woman. Or how Naoto in Persona 4 is a tomboy who wants to
536580	540280	exude a tough presence because she's entering into a male-dominated profession, and she
540280	543080	was rewritten by English translators to be a trans man.
543080	547240	The most striking example is probably the most famous trap after Bridget, a Stolfo from
547240	552000	Fate. He explicitly says I am a man multiple times despite looking and acting girly, and
552000	557800	yet he's often considered a symbol of anti-transness online, simply because he's not trans.
557800	561880	The word trap is considered a slur against trans people, which is why the Are Traps Gay
561880	565940	kerfuffle from years ago was a thing. And when femboy began to replace trap as a word
565940	570320	used to describe feminine men, femboy began to be considered a slur in the same way. The
570320	573920	ethic that these people are operating under is, if you're not a traditionally masculine
573920	578520	man or feminine woman, if you're playing with gender in any way, you have to be trans,
578520	581800	or else you're offensive to trans people. What's really behind it, though, is simply
581800	584520	craving the cultural power that comes with representation.
584520	588600	The reason a Stolfo is the most striking example for our purposes is because Fate actually
588600	592520	has trans characters already, who are pretty good representation for that demographic.
592520	596480	But a Stolfo is popular. He's the face of the series, and so they want him. It's not
596480	599560	for representation's sake. If it were, they would know who they're already represented
599560	603960	by. It's for cultural colonization. It's for the cultural power that comes with the representation
603960	608420	being pushed front and center. And their pursuing this power makes for some, uh, really weird
608420	611260	scenarios. For example, in Cowboy Bebop, the character
611260	615360	of Gren is a former super soldier, who, as a side effect of the drugs he was given to
615360	619160	become a super soldier, has grown breasts. But he's still a man, and his arc in the
619160	623460	show deals with his PTSD, how his society basically sacrificed their veterans and threw
623460	627300	them away. And when he's mistaken for a woman or insulted by being called one, there's
627300	631180	a lot attached to that. But in the god-awful live-action Cowboy Bebop
631180	636340	show, Gren is reimagined as a proud, out, flamboyant, non-binary character. If the message
636340	640300	is that you can be abused and mistreated into gender non-conformity, that's not a
640300	644220	very positive way of looking at this topic. In fact, that's the weirdest thing about
644220	648300	this whole Bridget controversy. Terminally online twitteroids who are demanding that
648300	652220	Bridget is trans. You gotta know what this means, right? It means that Bridget is literally
652220	656380	a grooming victim. You could post him on Libs of TikTok and they'd actually be completely
656380	660500	correct for once. His story is that he was forced to be a girl by his parents to prevent
660500	664620	a religious superstition. And his entire arc is trying to get away from that life. Where
664620	669580	exactly is the positivity about Bridget being trans? Are you really okay with your trans
669580	674240	representation being a person who was socialized and tortured into being trans? Aren't you
674240	678220	just giving ammo to the conversion therapy fucks who want to do the same to you to make
678220	682380	you the other gender too? It seems like the online trans activists can't help but shoot
682380	686500	themselves in the foot every time this happens. This Bridget stuff was funny, and yeah, at
686500	690540	the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. If ArcSIS comes out and directly says, yes,
690540	694420	Bridget is trans, fine, it's just a game. These people still seem unhinged that this
694420	698560	is the story they want. Oh well, at least it made going back and watching old Markiplier
698560	722600	videos have a bit of an extra edge to them.
722600	741080	Are traps gay?
