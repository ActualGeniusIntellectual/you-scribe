1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,200
Hey! Did you know that everyone is gay for Bridget? Yeah, that's a really old meme.

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,040
If you're a Zoomer, you're not going to know the deep lore.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,920
In 2002, the fighting game Guilty Gear XX came out, adding to the roster what is undoubtedly

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,760
the series' most famous character, Bridget.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,240
The TLDR of the story is, Bridget was born in a village with a superstition that frowned

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,480
upon same-sex twins. So in order to avoid getting cursed, Bridget was raised as a girl

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,600
by his parents.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,720
When he became old enough, he ran away, became a bounty hunter, and desired to return home

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,840
one day after becoming successful, to prove to his parents that the superstition was false.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,000
But as a result of his upbringing, he looks, acts, and sounds quite feminine.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Bridget is the origin of the term trap. Yeah, from 20 years ago. The whole point of the

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,340
character is that everybody thinks he's a girl, but he's not. And this was generally

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,320
played for laughs and Guilty Gear, with straight men becoming embarrassed for their attraction

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,320
to him.

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,080
The 2000s saw a lot of Bridget fan porn, both men and women cosplaying as him. The Everybody's

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,200
Gay for Bridget meme highlighting his ability to attract and confuse straight men, as well

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,400
as the Dropped a Bridget on Him saying, which refers to a shocking gender reveal scene in

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
a piece of media.

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,520
The name Dropped a Bridget on Him is a cross between, well, Bridget, and the saying Dropped

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,000
a Bridge on Him, which is a trope where a character is written out of a story and given

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,120
an unceremonious quick death to get it over with, often because the actor left the show.

22
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,200
Despite this, the phrase Dropped a Bridge on Him comes from Captain Kirk's death in

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,960
Star Trek Generations, which wasn't unceremonious or quick, but was still a little bit odd.

24
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,680
Nobody expected him to die like a redshirt.

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,760
In any case, Bridget is a trap. You're gay for liking Bridget.

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,120
This stuff permeated 2000s era internet culture, and it was one of the first real instances

27
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,800
of acceptance of the idea of what we would now call gender nonconformity, at least among

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,680
males. We had tomboys before, yeah, but nothing for men.

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,600
It might be teasing and kinda rude, but that was the nature of acceptance back in the day.

30
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,000
Everybody takes their lumps to become a part of the crowd, and Bridget was a fan favorite,

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,380
specifically because of how the character played with gender.

32
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,980
In an interview in Anime Expo in 2009, the creator of Bridget, Daisuke Ishiwatari, was

33
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,700
asked if he anticipated Bridget's popularity. This was his reply through a translator.

34
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,980
There were already other good-looking and tough characters, so I added a cute character.

35
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,660
However, a lot of fighting games already had the token cute character, so I wanted something

36
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,000
unconventional. So I made a cute character that's a guy.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,020
The big surprise was that it didn't matter. Bridget still has a huge following.

38
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,920
There's nothing here about representation or whatever, it was just done on a whim, because

39
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,980
it was interesting and new. I can respect that. Make whatever you want to make.

40
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,980
But the recent shit show about Bridget is that he was added into the latest game, Guilty

41
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,980
Gear Strive, as a DLC character. And there are a lot of very loud, vocal individuals

42
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,060
online right now, insisting that Bridget is not a trap, or a femboy, or any other sort

43
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,780
of feminine man, but is in fact a trans woman. And they use these clips from the English

44
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,980
version of the game to say so

45
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:33,280
Fair enough. That sounds a lot like Bridget is dejected when he says I'm a boy, and is

46
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,260
very happy, like a weight is off his shoulders, when he says girl is fine because I'm a girl.

47
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,700
This is being treated as Bridget's coming out moment. Bridget is trans guys. If you

48
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,980
spread any of those old memes around, you're a transphobic bigot. We're going to lock

49
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,220
down the Guilty Gear wiki and prevent anybody from talking about it, because Bridget is

50
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,060
trans and the person who's an admin on the site is also trans. Also if you have any complaints

51
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,420
about any of this, you're a nerdy man baby who is worrying too much about fictional characters,

52
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,720
and the world is changing and leaving you behind. Well, yeah it actually doesn't matter

53
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,540
if people make Bridget trans or not, it is just a game. Just like the pride flag in Spider-Man

54
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,980
is also just a game.

55
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,200
But when somebody draws Black Panther as a white man, or posts an old image of Bridget

56
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,260
being a trap, these people scream bloody fucking murder. So clearly they think it matters,

57
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,660
and they're hoping you will take the bait of it doesn't matter, so that they can do

58
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,460
what they like without any pushback.

59
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,460
More importantly, let's examine the actual situation here. People are saying that the

60
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,980
Bridget comes out as a girl scene is from a bad ending and therefore we should laugh

61
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,740
at the people who consider this to be canon. That's actually not true. In Guilty Gear,

62
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,560
the endings in Arcade mode are all canon. They each reveal a different part of the story,

63
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,620
but none of them actually overwrite each other. For example, Bridget's three endings

64
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,800
in Guilty Gear XX each tell a different story, where Bridget brings a reward back to the

65
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,780
village, where Bridget befriends the jellyfish pirates, and where Bridget is hit on by Johnny.

66
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,200
But in the next game, it's canon that all three of these endings happened, and none

67
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,720
of them actually prevent the others from being true and some kind of consistency problem.

68
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,200
This is how the games are written. Each ending provides a different story point, and to get

69
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,600
the full story you watch all of the endings. And some people are using the clips where

70
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,920
Bridget says I'm a boy to counteract the clips where Bridget says I'm a girl. And

71
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,160
at that point it's just cherry picking what you want to hear. But nonetheless, I still

72
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,400
don't think that Bridget is trans or a woman. I do think that Bridget is still the same

73
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,800
femboy trap he's always been. And here's why. The Japanese internet, and more importantly

74
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,360
ArcSys in Japan, still refers to him as a boy. In Japanese, he's specifically referred

75
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,180
to as an otokonoko. Yeah, y'all knew this word was coming. It means male daughter. Otokonoko

76
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,480
is a type of gender nonconformity unique to Japan, but it's explicitly not trans. Otokonokos

77
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,080
are still men, they're just feminine men. They've adopted a feminine role, but they

78
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,840
don't consider themselves women. And while the English version of Bridget's final line

79
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:53,340
is translated as a triumphant coming out moment, the Japanese one has added context. Otokonoko

80
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,440
will often refer to themselves as girls, specifically in this type of playful way, not because they

81
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,880
actually consider themselves girls, but more as a playful aesthetic flourish. And there's

82
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,880
probably a few weirdos out there who will say that this point is cope, she's obviously

83
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,480
trans. But you know, this actually happens regularly outside of Japan. How often do gay

84
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,640
effeminate men call themselves, or other gay effeminate men, girl? How often do drag queens

85
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,640
refer to themselves as girls, or ladies, or queens, obviously? None of this is an expression

86
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,480
of transness, of the desire to be a different physical sex, or of gender dysphoria. It's

87
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,240
all playful expressions of gender nonconformity. People are even saying that because the symbol

88
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,020
on Bridget's design was changed from a male one, that's got to be proof that he's trans.

89
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,800
But this isn't the trans symbol, it's the androgyny symbol which Otokonokos use in Japan.

90
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,920
A lot of the woke's gold replies to these points have an undercurrent of the idea that

91
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,560
Japanese people don't know how to do transness correctly, and that being Otokonoko is being

92
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,240
trans, even if both the Otokonokos themselves and the culture that spawned the idea disagrees.

93
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,120
At that point it feels like it's not about representation, but about cultural colonization.

94
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,720
And that's because it is! Let me show you how.

95
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,320
Lilith nailed it on the head back in 2018, when she tweeted this now-deleted banger.

96
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,560
In just half a decade, anime traps and dick girls have done more for the normalization

97
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,840
and popularization of feminine boys and trans women within the western zeitgeist than social

98
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,960
justice has since its inception. She nuked the tweet because the trans activists and

99
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,360
woke's golds were raging like mad at her. But this is a true statement. Bridget's

100
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,720
gold popularity and the current fan backlash can attest to that.

101
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,080
While Bridget was portrayed as a trap back in the day, testament from the same game series

102
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,120
was basically non-binary or some flavor of genderless before that was even a thing. In

103
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,120
earlier games he was portrayed as an androgynous man. People used he and him to refer to him,

104
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,520
and he was male, but he was more than happy looking and behaving like he was in between.

105
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,080
But in modern games he's been revisioned due to an in-story event which actually made

106
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,000
him biologically sexless. And yeah there was a little bit of fan backlash when this

107
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
happened too.

108
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,240
I think what's happening here is that people just like the idea of playing with gender

109
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,880
outside of the bounds of transness. There's a lot of gender stuff out there that isn't

110
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,760
strictly hyper-masculine or hyper-feminine that at one point existed separate from transness.

111
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,500
And the people who both liked those characters and viewed themselves in that way in real

112
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,560
life also preferred existing outside of the trans sphere.

113
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,600
But in recent years there's been a concerted cultural push to make everything that isn't

114
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,240
strictly man or woman trans, and that's not good. In other words, you can't have a feminine

115
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,040
male character anymore without the trans lobby demanding they be trans. And yeah they don't

116
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,600
actually care about Bridget or Testameter Guilty Gear.

117
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,800
My friend Dimitri Munro, who's actually a femboy IRL, does a lot of good videos on this

118
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,820
topic way more in-depth than me, but we can scratch the surface here for our purposes.

119
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,400
The manga I Think I Turned My Childhood Friend Into a Girl took that girl character, who

120
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,080
is an otokonoko in the original, and the plot, which was about two gay men falling

121
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,220
in love, one of whom was a trap, and through translation shenanigans, in English rewrote

122
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,580
the story to be about a trans woman. Or how Naoto in Persona 4 is a tomboy who wants to

123
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,280
exude a tough presence because she's entering into a male-dominated profession, and she

124
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,080
was rewritten by English translators to be a trans man.

125
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,240
The most striking example is probably the most famous trap after Bridget, a Stolfo from

126
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,000
Fate. He explicitly says I am a man multiple times despite looking and acting girly, and

127
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,800
yet he's often considered a symbol of anti-transness online, simply because he's not trans.

128
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,880
The word trap is considered a slur against trans people, which is why the Are Traps Gay

129
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,940
kerfuffle from years ago was a thing. And when femboy began to replace trap as a word

130
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,320
used to describe feminine men, femboy began to be considered a slur in the same way. The

131
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,920
ethic that these people are operating under is, if you're not a traditionally masculine

132
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,520
man or feminine woman, if you're playing with gender in any way, you have to be trans,

133
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,800
or else you're offensive to trans people. What's really behind it, though, is simply

134
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,520
craving the cultural power that comes with representation.

135
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,600
The reason a Stolfo is the most striking example for our purposes is because Fate actually

136
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,520
has trans characters already, who are pretty good representation for that demographic.

137
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,480
But a Stolfo is popular. He's the face of the series, and so they want him. It's not

138
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,560
for representation's sake. If it were, they would know who they're already represented

139
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,960
by. It's for cultural colonization. It's for the cultural power that comes with the representation

140
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,420
being pushed front and center. And their pursuing this power makes for some, uh, really weird

141
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,260
scenarios. For example, in Cowboy Bebop, the character

142
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,360
of Gren is a former super soldier, who, as a side effect of the drugs he was given to

143
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,160
become a super soldier, has grown breasts. But he's still a man, and his arc in the

144
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,460
show deals with his PTSD, how his society basically sacrificed their veterans and threw

145
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,300
them away. And when he's mistaken for a woman or insulted by being called one, there's

146
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,180
a lot attached to that. But in the god-awful live-action Cowboy Bebop

147
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:36,340
show, Gren is reimagined as a proud, out, flamboyant, non-binary character. If the message

148
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:40,300
is that you can be abused and mistreated into gender non-conformity, that's not a

149
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,220
very positive way of looking at this topic. In fact, that's the weirdest thing about

150
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,300
this whole Bridget controversy. Terminally online twitteroids who are demanding that

151
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,220
Bridget is trans. You gotta know what this means, right? It means that Bridget is literally

152
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,380
a grooming victim. You could post him on Libs of TikTok and they'd actually be completely

153
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,500
correct for once. His story is that he was forced to be a girl by his parents to prevent

154
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,620
a religious superstition. And his entire arc is trying to get away from that life. Where

155
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,580
exactly is the positivity about Bridget being trans? Are you really okay with your trans

156
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:14,240
representation being a person who was socialized and tortured into being trans? Aren't you

157
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,220
just giving ammo to the conversion therapy fucks who want to do the same to you to make

158
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,380
you the other gender too? It seems like the online trans activists can't help but shoot

159
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,500
themselves in the foot every time this happens. This Bridget stuff was funny, and yeah, at

160
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,540
the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. If ArcSIS comes out and directly says, yes,

161
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,420
Bridget is trans, fine, it's just a game. These people still seem unhinged that this

162
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,560
is the story they want. Oh well, at least it made going back and watching old Markiplier

163
00:11:38,560 --> 00:12:02,600
videos have a bit of an extra edge to them.

164
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:21,080
Are traps gay?
