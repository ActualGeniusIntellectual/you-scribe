0	10940	A few weeks back, the Japanese Twitter account for McDonald's put out a series of advertisements,
10940	12980	all of which use the same art style.
12980	17140	The first one is of a mother, father, and their daughter eating McDonald's together.
17140	21540	The second one is a group of high school aged friends hanging out and eating McDonald's
21540	22540	together.
22540	26760	And the third one is a bunch of Halloween monsters driving down a bridge in a convertible
26760	28220	eating McDonald's together.
28240	33720	Okay, that last one went from normal human situation to strange fantasy occurrence.
33720	38720	But all three were a part of the same ad campaign, drawn by the same artist and premiering around
38720	42400	the same time, specifically for the Japanese McDonald's audience.
42400	45040	And yet, that first one, the family oriented one?
45040	47880	That one went viral online, but not in Japan.
47880	52460	In the English speaking world, this ad became a meme for about a week, with people posting
52460	55000	tons of fan art of the characters.
55000	59140	Funny versions, sad versions, lewd versions, pepe versions.
59140	62020	And to be honest, the whole situation seems kind of odd.
62020	64300	Why did this go viral of all things?
64300	70020	Well, this grotesque recreation by political cartoonist George Alexopoulos can probably
70020	71020	clue you in.
71020	74960	He redrew that same family McDonald's scene, only woke-ified.
74960	78640	It looks like Lizzo is one parent, and I think Dylan Mulvaney is the other one.
78640	83140	A pride flag is draped in the background, and the kid is their fat adopted baby covered
83140	85340	in slop and surrounded by slop.
85340	90760	I think the kid is inspired by this early internet meme of a morbidly obese child at
90760	91760	McDonald's.
91760	92760	This picture is from 2002, guys.
92760	95200	I used to see this posted everywhere back in the day.
95200	99140	I don't think you could get away with making this picture into a meme nowadays, but it's
99140	103160	so prevalent on the internet that it's basically just been grandfathered in at this point.
103160	108120	The point is, though, the family McDonald's ad contained no woke political messaging,
108120	110600	no shoehorned minority representation.
110600	112880	It was just a normal family dynamic.
112880	115680	Parents and child enjoying a meal and being happy.
115680	119500	It looks like the kind of scene that most regular people would actually want to experience
119500	121020	in their own lives.
121020	125860	Moreover, for the Zoomer generation, who have known nothing but politically slanted advertising,
125860	129140	it was a glimpse into a different reality for just a second.
129140	133140	An advertisement that didn't talk about Black Lives Matter or the Trans-Bean struggle
133140	134140	or whatever?
134140	135780	It just wants to sell me burgers?
135780	137020	What a novel idea.
137020	141460	All you have to do is compare the main English-speaking McDonald's account to the Japanese one to
141460	142460	see the difference.
142460	145200	Why is McDonald's talking to me about Black trans women?
145200	147120	Where's the fucking hamburgers, dude?
147120	151680	This is a big difference between Western and non-Western advertisements.
151680	155960	Western corporations make political advertising because the people at the top of those corporations
155960	159840	believe it will net them more customers if they virtue signal about the latest hot-button
159840	160840	topic.
160840	164660	While people in the middle of these corporations have convinced their superiors of this because
164660	169280	they believe they have a moral obligation to push forward a specific partisan message
169280	173340	using whatever social or cultural influence they might have.
173340	178020	Non-Western corporations tend not to behave this way, and seeing straightforward advertising
178020	180780	like this comes as a bit of a shock in 2023.
180780	185580	I remember back in school I took a media arts class, and one section of it was on advertising.
185580	190340	Advertising, at least back then, tended to focus around what the viewer can gain by consuming
190340	191340	the product.
191340	195220	An ad like the McDonald's family one, if we had examined it back in that class, the
195220	196680	teacher would have said something like,
196680	201400	McDonald's is promoting a specific type of lifestyle, in this case a happy nuclear family,
201400	206280	with the subtle implication of, if that lifestyle appeals to you, then you can consume McDonald's
206280	208180	and live that lifestyle too.
208180	212520	You too can be a part of a happy nuclear family if you eat McDonald's.
212520	216760	In that class, we learned that this type of advertising is just subversive in the end.
216760	220200	Obviously, eating McDonald's won't be the thing that allows you to have a nuclear family
220200	224340	in your life, or a set of school friends, or a car full of Halloween monsters.
224400	228340	The advertisement simply needs to make you feel like it will long enough to make that
228340	229340	sale.
229340	230340	It's quite insidious.
230340	235280	But, in 2023, it's also actually quite refreshing, because a lot of Western ad agencies have
235280	239880	moved away from that sort of, promote a lifestyle advertising, and have moved into more direct
239880	241280	virtue signaling.
241280	245760	McDonald's supports trans rights and BLM, therefore if you want to support trans rights
245760	247720	and BLM, you should consume McDonald's.
247720	249640	You're a good person, aren't you?
249640	250840	Don't you support trans rights?
250840	252680	Why aren't you consuming McDonald's?
252680	255660	It's a significantly more hostile form of advertising.
255660	259980	Before, ads would promote a positive vision, a possible future for your life if you just
259980	261240	bought their product.
261240	263340	It was fake, but at least it was positive.
263340	268100	Now ads in the West tell you that you're a bad person if you don't buy the product.
268100	272520	Consumption has become its own form of activism, and you know that this is true.
272520	275900	Remember back when progressives were shitting on people for liking that Joker movie?
275900	278260	Or they were complaining that it was bigoted or sexist?
278260	282020	That those same people weren't going to see that shitty Harley Quinn movie?
282020	286580	It's not a super common position, but it is common enough among the more consumerist-oriented
286580	291700	lefty spaces that a valid form of social justice activism is the consumption of politically
291700	296840	correct products, and in that same vein, the suppression of politically incorrect products.
296840	301760	So when the West got a hold of that McDonald's family ad, it was like a breath of fresh air.
301760	306580	Oh thank you God, a piece of corporate advertising that isn't preaching at me about how awful
306580	308940	a person I am or how ruined the world is.
308940	312380	They just want to lie to me about what their shitty food will do to my life.
312380	317580	Imagine being that poor Japanese McDonald's Twitter intern who has no idea why their latest
317580	321520	innocuous post is taking off in another language halfway across the world.
321520	323500	The Japanese figured it out pretty quickly though.
323500	328340	Japanese Twitter users and bloggers were writing about exactly what I just mentioned, the dominance
328340	332540	of politically correct advertising in the West, and how your average person is simply
332540	333940	tired of it all.
333940	337420	And of course, it became one of those flash-in-the-pan culture wars.
337420	340340	But according to some leftoids online, no it didn't.
340340	342100	That was all just made up by the rightoids.
342100	344480	Here's Sean, formerly of Sean and Jen.
344480	348360	I scrolled the quote tweets on this for a very long time, and saw hundreds of right-wingers
348360	352660	saying some variation of, I can't believe the left are melting down over this, and zero
352660	355180	evidence of any leftist caring about this at all.
355180	357020	An imaginary war going on.
357020	358300	Are you sure about that, Sean?
358300	360660	Here's a bunch of posts from left-leaning accounts.
360660	363780	It's creepy how the mom has the same proportions as the child.
363780	366020	I love my McBreeding ads.
366020	367860	The kid is old enough to eat by herself.
367860	369920	The way the mom hand-feeds her is weird.
369920	371940	She shouldn't sit in her dad's lap.
371940	372940	Excuse me, Japan.
372940	373940	Pedophilia!
373940	376180	McDonald's is now trying to appeal to pedos.
376180	380700	These people do quite literally hate the family dynamic promoted in the ad, by calling it
380700	383120	creepy or weird or pedophilic.
383120	387220	Because the daughter character happens to, you know, share physical traits with her parents.
387220	390520	Which is, uh, pretty common among people who reproduce.
390520	392700	Though I guess that's Nazism now, apparently.
392700	397380	Also, these people consider childlike innocence to be sexual, and then they call the ad pedophilic.
397380	400220	It sounds like they might need their fucking hard drives searched.
400220	404060	Moreover, some leftoids actually gave the inverse take of Sean's.
404060	408180	Sean said that nobody on the left was culture warring over this, when they actually were.
408180	412460	While a few of these takes immediately expected the right to culture war over this, which
412460	413460	they actually did.
413460	414940	Presumably for the reasons I mentioned earlier.
414940	419500	Sean specifically said, the right gets mad when they see what they consider a non-traditional
419500	423300	representation of a family, so they assume the inverse must be true for people to the
423300	424300	left of them.
424300	428400	But, these are leftists who are getting mad at a traditional representation of a family
428400	432140	by crying about how they're too straight, or too white, or about how this appeals to
432140	433980	right wingers or whatever the fuck.
433980	439200	Basically, both sides are now playing idpol, screaming bloody murder online when the next
439200	441540	bit of culture doesn't directly represent them.
441540	444300	It's just that the left is vastly overrepresented right now.
444300	448680	So when a normal ass family takes center stage for once, it's considered a rare event.
448680	452880	Here's everyone's favorite communist Canadian, no, not me, Lance from the serfs.
452880	454500	And he went even stupider.
454500	458640	Not a single person of any political persuasion complained about the anime McDonald's family
458640	459640	ad.
459640	463760	The right hates non-traditional family units so much, they assumed the opposite is true.
463760	467300	Imagine if the ad had two dads, how the outrage would be going right now.
467300	468300	And you know what?
468300	471720	The rightoids probably wouldn't like it if it were two gay dads featured in the McDonald's
471720	472720	ad.
472720	473720	I'll grant you that.
473720	477560	But Lance's greater point here, is his claim that the left does not hate traditional family
477560	478560	units.
479440	480440	Are you sure about that, Lance?
480440	481440	Are you sure about that, buddy?
481440	483720	I'm going to have to do a full video on this topic eventually.
483720	488040	But the whole abolish the family segment of the left has been frothing at the mouth since
488040	491680	angles over how much they hate traditional family units.
491680	494720	And yes, of course, right wingers engage in this culture war too.
494720	498680	You're not going to convince me that the guy who posted the quotes on this are revealing
498680	501360	that this ad is Jewish kryptonite is a leftoid.
501360	505960	But then again, considering the leftist response to the recent Hamas massacre in Israel, maybe
505960	507760	it is, who the fuck knows anymore?
508000	512000	But this is primarily a case of right wingers saying that the McDonald's ad is a breath
512000	517000	of fresh air, while left wingers oscillate between being offended at the straight cis
517000	521240	white pedophilic Nazi propaganda for promoting a happy nuclear family, while also trying
521240	524420	to pretend that they don't hate nuclear families or normal people.
524420	528240	The bigger question is, why did the right wingers really vibe with it?
528240	531400	Look at this other ad that came out of Japan, this time for Tokyo Disneyland.
531400	534800	It starts off with a little girl enjoying the theme park, and then she's a teenager
534800	537520	hanging out there with her friends when she bumps into a guy.
537520	541080	Then the two are on dates there, they get married, they bring their kids there.
541080	545240	This is a story told in a 30 second corporate advertisement that resonates with the hopes
545240	547080	and dreams of your average person.
547080	551000	It's not preaching to you about what you should do, what causes you should support,
551000	553400	or what type of evil person you are if you fail to do so.
553400	557320	It's not trying to inform you of some social justice struggle somewhere, it's simply
557320	561440	presenting a happy story that most people would want to live out themselves in some
561440	562440	form.
562440	564540	Now it's still corpo shit, you're not going to get a girlfriend just by going to
564540	565640	Disney World guys.
565640	569780	But the point is that it's a message of hope set against a realistic backdrop where
569780	573400	it could actually happen to you, and that's way more appealing to people than political
573400	574400	propaganda.
574400	578680	In other words, 20 years ago I found this marketing method of presenting a desirable
578680	582600	lifestyle and associating it with your product as soulless and exploitative.
582600	586620	But compared to the political activism ads that came after it, oh god, please give me
586620	587920	the 2000s back.
587920	591200	I know that I'm not going to meet a girl just by going to Disneyland or have a wife
591200	595200	and child just by ordering McDonalds, but I prefer that shit over being told that I'm
595200	599760	a straight white cis male oppressor who's destroying the economy and the climate and
599760	606760	making trans people kill themselves unless I eat the goyslop.
629760	643800	The fuck are you doing?
