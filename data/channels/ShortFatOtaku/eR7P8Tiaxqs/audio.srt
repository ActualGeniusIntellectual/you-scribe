00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,940
A few weeks back, the Japanese Twitter account for McDonald's put out a series of advertisements,

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,980
all of which use the same art style.

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,140
The first one is of a mother, father, and their daughter eating McDonald's together.

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,540
The second one is a group of high school aged friends hanging out and eating McDonald's

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,540
together.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,760
And the third one is a bunch of Halloween monsters driving down a bridge in a convertible

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,220
eating McDonald's together.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,720
Okay, that last one went from normal human situation to strange fantasy occurrence.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,720
But all three were a part of the same ad campaign, drawn by the same artist and premiering around

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,400
the same time, specifically for the Japanese McDonald's audience.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,040
And yet, that first one, the family oriented one?

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,880
That one went viral online, but not in Japan.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,460
In the English speaking world, this ad became a meme for about a week, with people posting

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,000
tons of fan art of the characters.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,140
Funny versions, sad versions, lewd versions, pepe versions.

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,020
And to be honest, the whole situation seems kind of odd.

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,300
Why did this go viral of all things?

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:10,020
Well, this grotesque recreation by political cartoonist George Alexopoulos can probably

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,020
clue you in.

20
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,960
He redrew that same family McDonald's scene, only woke-ified.

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,640
It looks like Lizzo is one parent, and I think Dylan Mulvaney is the other one.

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,140
A pride flag is draped in the background, and the kid is their fat adopted baby covered

23
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,340
in slop and surrounded by slop.

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,760
I think the kid is inspired by this early internet meme of a morbidly obese child at

25
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,760
McDonald's.

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,760
This picture is from 2002, guys.

27
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,200
I used to see this posted everywhere back in the day.

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,140
I don't think you could get away with making this picture into a meme nowadays, but it's

29
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,160
so prevalent on the internet that it's basically just been grandfathered in at this point.

30
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,120
The point is, though, the family McDonald's ad contained no woke political messaging,

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,600
no shoehorned minority representation.

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,880
It was just a normal family dynamic.

33
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,680
Parents and child enjoying a meal and being happy.

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,500
It looks like the kind of scene that most regular people would actually want to experience

35
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,020
in their own lives.

36
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,860
Moreover, for the Zoomer generation, who have known nothing but politically slanted advertising,

37
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,140
it was a glimpse into a different reality for just a second.

38
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,140
An advertisement that didn't talk about Black Lives Matter or the Trans-Bean struggle

39
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,140
or whatever?

40
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,780
It just wants to sell me burgers?

41
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,020
What a novel idea.

42
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,460
All you have to do is compare the main English-speaking McDonald's account to the Japanese one to

43
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,460
see the difference.

44
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,200
Why is McDonald's talking to me about Black trans women?

45
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,120
Where's the fucking hamburgers, dude?

46
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,680
This is a big difference between Western and non-Western advertisements.

47
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,960
Western corporations make political advertising because the people at the top of those corporations

48
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,840
believe it will net them more customers if they virtue signal about the latest hot-button

49
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,840
topic.

50
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,660
While people in the middle of these corporations have convinced their superiors of this because

51
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,280
they believe they have a moral obligation to push forward a specific partisan message

52
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,340
using whatever social or cultural influence they might have.

53
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,020
Non-Western corporations tend not to behave this way, and seeing straightforward advertising

54
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,780
like this comes as a bit of a shock in 2023.

55
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,580
I remember back in school I took a media arts class, and one section of it was on advertising.

56
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,340
Advertising, at least back then, tended to focus around what the viewer can gain by consuming

57
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,340
the product.

58
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,220
An ad like the McDonald's family one, if we had examined it back in that class, the

59
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,680
teacher would have said something like,

60
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,400
McDonald's is promoting a specific type of lifestyle, in this case a happy nuclear family,

61
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,280
with the subtle implication of, if that lifestyle appeals to you, then you can consume McDonald's

62
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,180
and live that lifestyle too.

63
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,520
You too can be a part of a happy nuclear family if you eat McDonald's.

64
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,760
In that class, we learned that this type of advertising is just subversive in the end.

65
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,200
Obviously, eating McDonald's won't be the thing that allows you to have a nuclear family

66
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,340
in your life, or a set of school friends, or a car full of Halloween monsters.

67
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,340
The advertisement simply needs to make you feel like it will long enough to make that

68
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,340
sale.

69
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,340
It's quite insidious.

70
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,280
But, in 2023, it's also actually quite refreshing, because a lot of Western ad agencies have

71
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,880
moved away from that sort of, promote a lifestyle advertising, and have moved into more direct

72
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,280
virtue signaling.

73
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,760
McDonald's supports trans rights and BLM, therefore if you want to support trans rights

74
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,720
and BLM, you should consume McDonald's.

75
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,640
You're a good person, aren't you?

76
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,840
Don't you support trans rights?

77
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,680
Why aren't you consuming McDonald's?

78
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,660
It's a significantly more hostile form of advertising.

79
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,980
Before, ads would promote a positive vision, a possible future for your life if you just

80
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,240
bought their product.

81
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,340
It was fake, but at least it was positive.

82
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,100
Now ads in the West tell you that you're a bad person if you don't buy the product.

83
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,520
Consumption has become its own form of activism, and you know that this is true.

84
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,900
Remember back when progressives were shitting on people for liking that Joker movie?

85
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,260
Or they were complaining that it was bigoted or sexist?

86
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,020
That those same people weren't going to see that shitty Harley Quinn movie?

87
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,580
It's not a super common position, but it is common enough among the more consumerist-oriented

88
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,700
lefty spaces that a valid form of social justice activism is the consumption of politically

89
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,840
correct products, and in that same vein, the suppression of politically incorrect products.

90
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,760
So when the West got a hold of that McDonald's family ad, it was like a breath of fresh air.

91
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,580
Oh thank you God, a piece of corporate advertising that isn't preaching at me about how awful

92
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,940
a person I am or how ruined the world is.

93
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,380
They just want to lie to me about what their shitty food will do to my life.

94
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,580
Imagine being that poor Japanese McDonald's Twitter intern who has no idea why their latest

95
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,520
innocuous post is taking off in another language halfway across the world.

96
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,500
The Japanese figured it out pretty quickly though.

97
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,340
Japanese Twitter users and bloggers were writing about exactly what I just mentioned, the dominance

98
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,540
of politically correct advertising in the West, and how your average person is simply

99
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,940
tired of it all.

100
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,420
And of course, it became one of those flash-in-the-pan culture wars.

101
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,340
But according to some leftoids online, no it didn't.

102
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,100
That was all just made up by the rightoids.

103
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,480
Here's Sean, formerly of Sean and Jen.

104
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,360
I scrolled the quote tweets on this for a very long time, and saw hundreds of right-wingers

105
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,660
saying some variation of, I can't believe the left are melting down over this, and zero

106
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,180
evidence of any leftist caring about this at all.

107
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,020
An imaginary war going on.

108
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,300
Are you sure about that, Sean?

109
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,660
Here's a bunch of posts from left-leaning accounts.

110
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,780
It's creepy how the mom has the same proportions as the child.

111
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,020
I love my McBreeding ads.

112
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,860
The kid is old enough to eat by herself.

113
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,920
The way the mom hand-feeds her is weird.

114
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,940
She shouldn't sit in her dad's lap.

115
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,940
Excuse me, Japan.

116
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,940
Pedophilia!

117
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,180
McDonald's is now trying to appeal to pedos.

118
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,700
These people do quite literally hate the family dynamic promoted in the ad, by calling it

119
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,120
creepy or weird or pedophilic.

120
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,220
Because the daughter character happens to, you know, share physical traits with her parents.

121
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,520
Which is, uh, pretty common among people who reproduce.

122
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,700
Though I guess that's Nazism now, apparently.

123
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,380
Also, these people consider childlike innocence to be sexual, and then they call the ad pedophilic.

124
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,220
It sounds like they might need their fucking hard drives searched.

125
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,060
Moreover, some leftoids actually gave the inverse take of Sean's.

126
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,180
Sean said that nobody on the left was culture warring over this, when they actually were.

127
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,460
While a few of these takes immediately expected the right to culture war over this, which

128
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,460
they actually did.

129
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,940
Presumably for the reasons I mentioned earlier.

130
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,500
Sean specifically said, the right gets mad when they see what they consider a non-traditional

131
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,300
representation of a family, so they assume the inverse must be true for people to the

132
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,300
left of them.

133
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,400
But, these are leftists who are getting mad at a traditional representation of a family

134
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,140
by crying about how they're too straight, or too white, or about how this appeals to

135
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,980
right wingers or whatever the fuck.

136
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:19,200
Basically, both sides are now playing idpol, screaming bloody murder online when the next

137
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,540
bit of culture doesn't directly represent them.

138
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,300
It's just that the left is vastly overrepresented right now.

139
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,680
So when a normal ass family takes center stage for once, it's considered a rare event.

140
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,880
Here's everyone's favorite communist Canadian, no, not me, Lance from the serfs.

141
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,500
And he went even stupider.

142
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,640
Not a single person of any political persuasion complained about the anime McDonald's family

143
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
ad.

144
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,760
The right hates non-traditional family units so much, they assumed the opposite is true.

145
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,300
Imagine if the ad had two dads, how the outrage would be going right now.

146
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,300
And you know what?

147
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,720
The rightoids probably wouldn't like it if it were two gay dads featured in the McDonald's

148
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
ad.

149
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
I'll grant you that.

150
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,560
But Lance's greater point here, is his claim that the left does not hate traditional family

151
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
units.

152
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Are you sure about that, Lance?

153
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
Are you sure about that, buddy?

154
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,720
I'm going to have to do a full video on this topic eventually.

155
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,040
But the whole abolish the family segment of the left has been frothing at the mouth since

156
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,680
angles over how much they hate traditional family units.

157
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,720
And yes, of course, right wingers engage in this culture war too.

158
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,680
You're not going to convince me that the guy who posted the quotes on this are revealing

159
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,360
that this ad is Jewish kryptonite is a leftoid.

160
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,960
But then again, considering the leftist response to the recent Hamas massacre in Israel, maybe

161
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,760
it is, who the fuck knows anymore?

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But this is primarily a case of right wingers saying that the McDonald's ad is a breath

163
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
of fresh air, while left wingers oscillate between being offended at the straight cis

164
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,240
white pedophilic Nazi propaganda for promoting a happy nuclear family, while also trying

165
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,420
to pretend that they don't hate nuclear families or normal people.

166
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,240
The bigger question is, why did the right wingers really vibe with it?

167
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,400
Look at this other ad that came out of Japan, this time for Tokyo Disneyland.

168
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,800
It starts off with a little girl enjoying the theme park, and then she's a teenager

169
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,520
hanging out there with her friends when she bumps into a guy.

170
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,080
Then the two are on dates there, they get married, they bring their kids there.

171
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,240
This is a story told in a 30 second corporate advertisement that resonates with the hopes

172
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,080
and dreams of your average person.

173
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,000
It's not preaching to you about what you should do, what causes you should support,

174
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,400
or what type of evil person you are if you fail to do so.

175
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,320
It's not trying to inform you of some social justice struggle somewhere, it's simply

176
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,440
presenting a happy story that most people would want to live out themselves in some

177
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
form.

178
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,540
Now it's still corpo shit, you're not going to get a girlfriend just by going to

179
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,640
Disney World guys.

180
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,780
But the point is that it's a message of hope set against a realistic backdrop where

181
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,400
it could actually happen to you, and that's way more appealing to people than political

182
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
propaganda.

183
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,680
In other words, 20 years ago I found this marketing method of presenting a desirable

184
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,600
lifestyle and associating it with your product as soulless and exploitative.

185
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,620
But compared to the political activism ads that came after it, oh god, please give me

186
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,920
the 2000s back.

187
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,200
I know that I'm not going to meet a girl just by going to Disneyland or have a wife

188
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,200
and child just by ordering McDonalds, but I prefer that shit over being told that I'm

189
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,760
a straight white cis male oppressor who's destroying the economy and the climate and

190
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,760
making trans people kill themselves unless I eat the goyslop.

191
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:43,800
The fuck are you doing?
