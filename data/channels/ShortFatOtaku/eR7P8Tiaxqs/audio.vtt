00:00.000 --> 00:10.940
A few weeks back, the Japanese Twitter account for McDonald's put out a series of advertisements,

00:10.940 --> 00:12.980
all of which use the same art style.

00:12.980 --> 00:17.140
The first one is of a mother, father, and their daughter eating McDonald's together.

00:17.140 --> 00:21.540
The second one is a group of high school aged friends hanging out and eating McDonald's

00:21.540 --> 00:22.540
together.

00:22.540 --> 00:26.760
And the third one is a bunch of Halloween monsters driving down a bridge in a convertible

00:26.760 --> 00:28.220
eating McDonald's together.

00:28.240 --> 00:33.720
Okay, that last one went from normal human situation to strange fantasy occurrence.

00:33.720 --> 00:38.720
But all three were a part of the same ad campaign, drawn by the same artist and premiering around

00:38.720 --> 00:42.400
the same time, specifically for the Japanese McDonald's audience.

00:42.400 --> 00:45.040
And yet, that first one, the family oriented one?

00:45.040 --> 00:47.880
That one went viral online, but not in Japan.

00:47.880 --> 00:52.460
In the English speaking world, this ad became a meme for about a week, with people posting

00:52.460 --> 00:55.000
tons of fan art of the characters.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.140
Funny versions, sad versions, lewd versions, pepe versions.

00:59.140 --> 01:02.020
And to be honest, the whole situation seems kind of odd.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.300
Why did this go viral of all things?

01:04.300 --> 01:10.020
Well, this grotesque recreation by political cartoonist George Alexopoulos can probably

01:10.020 --> 01:11.020
clue you in.

01:11.020 --> 01:14.960
He redrew that same family McDonald's scene, only woke-ified.

01:14.960 --> 01:18.640
It looks like Lizzo is one parent, and I think Dylan Mulvaney is the other one.

01:18.640 --> 01:23.140
A pride flag is draped in the background, and the kid is their fat adopted baby covered

01:23.140 --> 01:25.340
in slop and surrounded by slop.

01:25.340 --> 01:30.760
I think the kid is inspired by this early internet meme of a morbidly obese child at

01:30.760 --> 01:31.760
McDonald's.

01:31.760 --> 01:32.760
This picture is from 2002, guys.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.200
I used to see this posted everywhere back in the day.

01:35.200 --> 01:39.140
I don't think you could get away with making this picture into a meme nowadays, but it's

01:39.140 --> 01:43.160
so prevalent on the internet that it's basically just been grandfathered in at this point.

01:43.160 --> 01:48.120
The point is, though, the family McDonald's ad contained no woke political messaging,

01:48.120 --> 01:50.600
no shoehorned minority representation.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.880
It was just a normal family dynamic.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.680
Parents and child enjoying a meal and being happy.

01:55.680 --> 01:59.500
It looks like the kind of scene that most regular people would actually want to experience

01:59.500 --> 02:01.020
in their own lives.

02:01.020 --> 02:05.860
Moreover, for the Zoomer generation, who have known nothing but politically slanted advertising,

02:05.860 --> 02:09.140
it was a glimpse into a different reality for just a second.

02:09.140 --> 02:13.140
An advertisement that didn't talk about Black Lives Matter or the Trans-Bean struggle

02:13.140 --> 02:14.140
or whatever?

02:14.140 --> 02:15.780
It just wants to sell me burgers?

02:15.780 --> 02:17.020
What a novel idea.

02:17.020 --> 02:21.460
All you have to do is compare the main English-speaking McDonald's account to the Japanese one to

02:21.460 --> 02:22.460
see the difference.

02:22.460 --> 02:25.200
Why is McDonald's talking to me about Black trans women?

02:25.200 --> 02:27.120
Where's the fucking hamburgers, dude?

02:27.120 --> 02:31.680
This is a big difference between Western and non-Western advertisements.

02:31.680 --> 02:35.960
Western corporations make political advertising because the people at the top of those corporations

02:35.960 --> 02:39.840
believe it will net them more customers if they virtue signal about the latest hot-button

02:39.840 --> 02:40.840
topic.

02:40.840 --> 02:44.660
While people in the middle of these corporations have convinced their superiors of this because

02:44.660 --> 02:49.280
they believe they have a moral obligation to push forward a specific partisan message

02:49.280 --> 02:53.340
using whatever social or cultural influence they might have.

02:53.340 --> 02:58.020
Non-Western corporations tend not to behave this way, and seeing straightforward advertising

02:58.020 --> 03:00.780
like this comes as a bit of a shock in 2023.

03:00.780 --> 03:05.580
I remember back in school I took a media arts class, and one section of it was on advertising.

03:05.580 --> 03:10.340
Advertising, at least back then, tended to focus around what the viewer can gain by consuming

03:10.340 --> 03:11.340
the product.

03:11.340 --> 03:15.220
An ad like the McDonald's family one, if we had examined it back in that class, the

03:15.220 --> 03:16.680
teacher would have said something like,

03:16.680 --> 03:21.400
McDonald's is promoting a specific type of lifestyle, in this case a happy nuclear family,

03:21.400 --> 03:26.280
with the subtle implication of, if that lifestyle appeals to you, then you can consume McDonald's

03:26.280 --> 03:28.180
and live that lifestyle too.

03:28.180 --> 03:32.520
You too can be a part of a happy nuclear family if you eat McDonald's.

03:32.520 --> 03:36.760
In that class, we learned that this type of advertising is just subversive in the end.

03:36.760 --> 03:40.200
Obviously, eating McDonald's won't be the thing that allows you to have a nuclear family

03:40.200 --> 03:44.340
in your life, or a set of school friends, or a car full of Halloween monsters.

03:44.400 --> 03:48.340
The advertisement simply needs to make you feel like it will long enough to make that

03:48.340 --> 03:49.340
sale.

03:49.340 --> 03:50.340
It's quite insidious.

03:50.340 --> 03:55.280
But, in 2023, it's also actually quite refreshing, because a lot of Western ad agencies have

03:55.280 --> 03:59.880
moved away from that sort of, promote a lifestyle advertising, and have moved into more direct

03:59.880 --> 04:01.280
virtue signaling.

04:01.280 --> 04:05.760
McDonald's supports trans rights and BLM, therefore if you want to support trans rights

04:05.760 --> 04:07.720
and BLM, you should consume McDonald's.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.640
You're a good person, aren't you?

04:09.640 --> 04:10.840
Don't you support trans rights?

04:10.840 --> 04:12.680
Why aren't you consuming McDonald's?

04:12.680 --> 04:15.660
It's a significantly more hostile form of advertising.

04:15.660 --> 04:19.980
Before, ads would promote a positive vision, a possible future for your life if you just

04:19.980 --> 04:21.240
bought their product.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.340
It was fake, but at least it was positive.

04:23.340 --> 04:28.100
Now ads in the West tell you that you're a bad person if you don't buy the product.

04:28.100 --> 04:32.520
Consumption has become its own form of activism, and you know that this is true.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.900
Remember back when progressives were shitting on people for liking that Joker movie?

04:35.900 --> 04:38.260
Or they were complaining that it was bigoted or sexist?

04:38.260 --> 04:42.020
That those same people weren't going to see that shitty Harley Quinn movie?

04:42.020 --> 04:46.580
It's not a super common position, but it is common enough among the more consumerist-oriented

04:46.580 --> 04:51.700
lefty spaces that a valid form of social justice activism is the consumption of politically

04:51.700 --> 04:56.840
correct products, and in that same vein, the suppression of politically incorrect products.

04:56.840 --> 05:01.760
So when the West got a hold of that McDonald's family ad, it was like a breath of fresh air.

05:01.760 --> 05:06.580
Oh thank you God, a piece of corporate advertising that isn't preaching at me about how awful

05:06.580 --> 05:08.940
a person I am or how ruined the world is.

05:08.940 --> 05:12.380
They just want to lie to me about what their shitty food will do to my life.

05:12.380 --> 05:17.580
Imagine being that poor Japanese McDonald's Twitter intern who has no idea why their latest

05:17.580 --> 05:21.520
innocuous post is taking off in another language halfway across the world.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.500
The Japanese figured it out pretty quickly though.

05:23.500 --> 05:28.340
Japanese Twitter users and bloggers were writing about exactly what I just mentioned, the dominance

05:28.340 --> 05:32.540
of politically correct advertising in the West, and how your average person is simply

05:32.540 --> 05:33.940
tired of it all.

05:33.940 --> 05:37.420
And of course, it became one of those flash-in-the-pan culture wars.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.340
But according to some leftoids online, no it didn't.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.100
That was all just made up by the rightoids.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.480
Here's Sean, formerly of Sean and Jen.

05:44.480 --> 05:48.360
I scrolled the quote tweets on this for a very long time, and saw hundreds of right-wingers

05:48.360 --> 05:52.660
saying some variation of, I can't believe the left are melting down over this, and zero

05:52.660 --> 05:55.180
evidence of any leftist caring about this at all.

05:55.180 --> 05:57.020
An imaginary war going on.

05:57.020 --> 05:58.300
Are you sure about that, Sean?

05:58.300 --> 06:00.660
Here's a bunch of posts from left-leaning accounts.

06:00.660 --> 06:03.780
It's creepy how the mom has the same proportions as the child.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.020
I love my McBreeding ads.

06:06.020 --> 06:07.860
The kid is old enough to eat by herself.

06:07.860 --> 06:09.920
The way the mom hand-feeds her is weird.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.940
She shouldn't sit in her dad's lap.

06:11.940 --> 06:12.940
Excuse me, Japan.

06:12.940 --> 06:13.940
Pedophilia!

06:13.940 --> 06:16.180
McDonald's is now trying to appeal to pedos.

06:16.180 --> 06:20.700
These people do quite literally hate the family dynamic promoted in the ad, by calling it

06:20.700 --> 06:23.120
creepy or weird or pedophilic.

06:23.120 --> 06:27.220
Because the daughter character happens to, you know, share physical traits with her parents.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.520
Which is, uh, pretty common among people who reproduce.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.700
Though I guess that's Nazism now, apparently.

06:32.700 --> 06:37.380
Also, these people consider childlike innocence to be sexual, and then they call the ad pedophilic.

06:37.380 --> 06:40.220
It sounds like they might need their fucking hard drives searched.

06:40.220 --> 06:44.060
Moreover, some leftoids actually gave the inverse take of Sean's.

06:44.060 --> 06:48.180
Sean said that nobody on the left was culture warring over this, when they actually were.

06:48.180 --> 06:52.460
While a few of these takes immediately expected the right to culture war over this, which

06:52.460 --> 06:53.460
they actually did.

06:53.460 --> 06:54.940
Presumably for the reasons I mentioned earlier.

06:54.940 --> 06:59.500
Sean specifically said, the right gets mad when they see what they consider a non-traditional

06:59.500 --> 07:03.300
representation of a family, so they assume the inverse must be true for people to the

07:03.300 --> 07:04.300
left of them.

07:04.300 --> 07:08.400
But, these are leftists who are getting mad at a traditional representation of a family

07:08.400 --> 07:12.140
by crying about how they're too straight, or too white, or about how this appeals to

07:12.140 --> 07:13.980
right wingers or whatever the fuck.

07:13.980 --> 07:19.200
Basically, both sides are now playing idpol, screaming bloody murder online when the next

07:19.200 --> 07:21.540
bit of culture doesn't directly represent them.

07:21.540 --> 07:24.300
It's just that the left is vastly overrepresented right now.

07:24.300 --> 07:28.680
So when a normal ass family takes center stage for once, it's considered a rare event.

07:28.680 --> 07:32.880
Here's everyone's favorite communist Canadian, no, not me, Lance from the serfs.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.500
And he went even stupider.

07:34.500 --> 07:38.640
Not a single person of any political persuasion complained about the anime McDonald's family

07:38.640 --> 07:39.640
ad.

07:39.640 --> 07:43.760
The right hates non-traditional family units so much, they assumed the opposite is true.

07:43.760 --> 07:47.300
Imagine if the ad had two dads, how the outrage would be going right now.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.300
And you know what?

07:48.300 --> 07:51.720
The rightoids probably wouldn't like it if it were two gay dads featured in the McDonald's

07:51.720 --> 07:52.720
ad.

07:52.720 --> 07:53.720
I'll grant you that.

07:53.720 --> 07:57.560
But Lance's greater point here, is his claim that the left does not hate traditional family

07:57.560 --> 07:58.560
units.

07:59.440 --> 08:00.440
Are you sure about that, Lance?

08:00.440 --> 08:01.440
Are you sure about that, buddy?

08:01.440 --> 08:03.720
I'm going to have to do a full video on this topic eventually.

08:03.720 --> 08:08.040
But the whole abolish the family segment of the left has been frothing at the mouth since

08:08.040 --> 08:11.680
angles over how much they hate traditional family units.

08:11.680 --> 08:14.720
And yes, of course, right wingers engage in this culture war too.

08:14.720 --> 08:18.680
You're not going to convince me that the guy who posted the quotes on this are revealing

08:18.680 --> 08:21.360
that this ad is Jewish kryptonite is a leftoid.

08:21.360 --> 08:25.960
But then again, considering the leftist response to the recent Hamas massacre in Israel, maybe

08:25.960 --> 08:27.760
it is, who the fuck knows anymore?

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
But this is primarily a case of right wingers saying that the McDonald's ad is a breath

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
of fresh air, while left wingers oscillate between being offended at the straight cis

08:37.000 --> 08:41.240
white pedophilic Nazi propaganda for promoting a happy nuclear family, while also trying

08:41.240 --> 08:44.420
to pretend that they don't hate nuclear families or normal people.

08:44.420 --> 08:48.240
The bigger question is, why did the right wingers really vibe with it?

08:48.240 --> 08:51.400
Look at this other ad that came out of Japan, this time for Tokyo Disneyland.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.800
It starts off with a little girl enjoying the theme park, and then she's a teenager

08:54.800 --> 08:57.520
hanging out there with her friends when she bumps into a guy.

08:57.520 --> 09:01.080
Then the two are on dates there, they get married, they bring their kids there.

09:01.080 --> 09:05.240
This is a story told in a 30 second corporate advertisement that resonates with the hopes

09:05.240 --> 09:07.080
and dreams of your average person.

09:07.080 --> 09:11.000
It's not preaching to you about what you should do, what causes you should support,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.400
or what type of evil person you are if you fail to do so.

09:13.400 --> 09:17.320
It's not trying to inform you of some social justice struggle somewhere, it's simply

09:17.320 --> 09:21.440
presenting a happy story that most people would want to live out themselves in some

09:21.440 --> 09:22.440
form.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.540
Now it's still corpo shit, you're not going to get a girlfriend just by going to

09:24.540 --> 09:25.640
Disney World guys.

09:25.640 --> 09:29.780
But the point is that it's a message of hope set against a realistic backdrop where

09:29.780 --> 09:33.400
it could actually happen to you, and that's way more appealing to people than political

09:33.400 --> 09:34.400
propaganda.

09:34.400 --> 09:38.680
In other words, 20 years ago I found this marketing method of presenting a desirable

09:38.680 --> 09:42.600
lifestyle and associating it with your product as soulless and exploitative.

09:42.600 --> 09:46.620
But compared to the political activism ads that came after it, oh god, please give me

09:46.620 --> 09:47.920
the 2000s back.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.200
I know that I'm not going to meet a girl just by going to Disneyland or have a wife

09:51.200 --> 09:55.200
and child just by ordering McDonalds, but I prefer that shit over being told that I'm

09:55.200 --> 09:59.760
a straight white cis male oppressor who's destroying the economy and the climate and

09:59.760 --> 10:06.760
making trans people kill themselves unless I eat the goyslop.

10:29.760 --> 10:43.800
The fuck are you doing?
