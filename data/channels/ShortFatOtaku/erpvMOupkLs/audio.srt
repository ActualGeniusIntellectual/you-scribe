00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
Hey guys, welcome to SJ Weekly for July 1st, 2018.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,280
And you know what that means, right?

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:27,120
It's Canada Day!

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,400
Let's spend today going over some of the most ridiculous Canadian SJW bullshit I can

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,400
find.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,960
And why don't we start at the top with Justin Trudeau?

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,320
To those who marched here in Canada for an end to gun violence, we hear you, and this

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,720
week we introduced a plan for common sense gun control that will keep our communities

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,720
safer.

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,760
This was on March 24th, 2018, meaning that it was happening around the whole Emma Gonzalez-David

11
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,440
Hogg school shooting bullshit in the states.

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,080
Well, even though Canada already has stricter gun laws than the states, a bunch of Canadians

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,560
still marched in support.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,200
And Trudeau took this opportunity to do some virtue signalling.

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's actually read that legislation though.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,360
Firearms legislation to make communities safer.

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,760
Crime rates generally in Canada have been on the decline for more than two decades,

18
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,660
but offences involving firearms have become more prevalent, especially since 2013.

19
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,640
Many communities across the country have been facing a steady increase in gun violence over

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,960
the past five years.

21
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,360
Gun-related homicides, domestic and gender-based violence involving guns, criminal gang activity,

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,840
and gun thefts are all up significantly.

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,040
To keep communities safe, the government of Canada is strengthening Canada's gun laws

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,320
in a common-sense, focused, and effective way.

25
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,760
Legislation introduced today prioritizes public safety and effective police work, while respecting

26
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,720
law-abiding firearms owners.

27
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,040
This government will not bring back the federal long gun registry.

28
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,880
Now, all of those problems there, the gun-related homicides, domestic and gender-based violence

29
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,000
involving guns, criminal gang activity, and gun thefts, those are all already illegal,

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,560
and a lot of those, especially the gang violence, are committed with illegally owned guns anyway.

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,400
So I'm not exactly sure what stricter regulations on guns is going to do to help with something

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,360
like criminal gang activity.

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,880
The first four points on this list are at least somewhat reasonable, so I'm not going

34
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,080
to go over them, but let's talk about point five here.

35
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,600
The new legislation proposes to bolster community safety in relation to restricted and prohibited

36
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,140
firearms, mostly handguns and assault weapons.

37
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,760
The term assault weapon is one of those weasel words that doesn't really mean anything in

38
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,120
terms of any kind of real-world gun classification.

39
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,960
It's a very vague, very general idea that doesn't actually correspond to any class of

40
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,320
gun in reality.

41
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,640
So whenever I see some kind of gun legislation bring up assault weapons, to me that basically

42
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,500
means that they're looking to heavily restrict things based on vague criteria.

43
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,760
And considering that the Democrats in the United States have been using this term to

44
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,200
try and do the same thing for the past 20 years or so, I'm not surprised to see it here.

45
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,480
But while we're on the topic of government legislative ineffectualness, decriminalizing

46
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,640
prostitution would negatively impact Indigenous women.

47
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,440
A London, Ontario court is hearing arguments about the constitutionality of Canada's prostitution

48
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
laws.

49
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,000
An academic testifying about Canada's prostitution laws says decriminalization would disproportionately

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,260
affect Indigenous women and girls.

51
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,320
Even in a system where prostitution is legal, if you have girls working as prostitutes and

52
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,020
not just women, you have a whole other problem.

53
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,680
Indigenous women are now overrepresented in the sex industry, but there's no evidence

54
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,680
that prostitution existed prior to colonization, said Cherry Smiley, an academic who studies

55
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,020
the impact of prostitution on the lives of Indigenous women and girls.

56
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,560
Well first of all, Cherry Smiley, are you sure that that's not your own prostitute name?

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,040
Because it kind of sounds like it might be.

58
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,960
But this idea that prostitution didn't exist prior to colonization, it's called the oldest

59
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,660
profession in the world for a reason.

60
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:01,360
Even if Canada's native population hadn't invented money yet on the time of European

61
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,320
contact, I'm sure there were still women out there who traded sex for other things.

62
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,700
For goods, or for protection, or for access to certain lands, or whatever.

63
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,720
Because the truth is, Indigenous women are human too, and there is always some kind of

64
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,920
sex trade wherever humans go.

65
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,680
I honestly thought it was racist nowadays to believe in the idea of the noble savage.

66
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,120
The underlying ideology of sex buyers is that they can buy a woman and engage in sex on

67
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,920
his terms, Smiley said.

68
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920
Well no, you've got that completely wrong.

69
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,460
You call them sex buyers because they're not buying a woman, they're buying sex.

70
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,320
They're not purchasing a good, they're obtaining a service.

71
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,380
For example, if you were to call me, say, a meal buyer, and then using this sentence

72
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:54,520
structure you could say that I go to a restaurant, I buy a waitress, and I engage in her serving

73
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,660
me food on my terms.

74
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,080
And then that arrangement ends when I've finished the meal I've paid and I've left the restaurant.

75
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,400
It's the same thing with prostitutes.

76
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,520
You don't actually buy the woman, you don't actually buy the waitress.

77
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,120
You buy the food and you eat it.

78
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,400
Or you buy the sex, but you don't buy the person.

79
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,680
In essence, the sex buyer is paying for a service and there is a reasonable expectation

80
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,320
that that service is provided.

81
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,440
You can say that all these women don't want to do it, they're just doing it for the money.

82
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,520
Well, that's most jobs.

83
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,080
Most people don't want to be waitresses or waiters.

84
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,120
They do it for the money.

85
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,980
Most people don't want to go work in a factory.

86
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,040
They do it for the money.

87
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,440
Most people don't want to collect garbage or plow roads, but they do it for the money.

88
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
This is no different.

89
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,120
Smiley was the crown's first witness.

90
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,920
She's an indigenous woman who has done an art exhibit with women who work in prostitution

91
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,680
and she has worked with women who have suffered abuse and sexual violence.

92
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,600
Those two things are very different and I don't know why this article conflates them

93
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
in this way.

94
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,160
The court case centers around a London couple who was charged after the escort agency they

95
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,520
were running, Fantasy World Escorts, was shut down by London police in November 2015.

96
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,960
Their lawyers are arguing that three of the charges, procuring, advertising, and materially

97
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,520
benefiting from the sexual services of someone else, violate sex workers' constitutional

98
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,200
right to the security of the person.

99
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
And that's actually true.

100
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:13,040
I think it was back in 2012 prostitution was just straight up illegal in Canada and another

101
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,400
court case heard making it illegal for prostitutes to engage in sex work made it disproportionately

102
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,080
unsafe and that that level of unsafety was driven only by government intervention.

103
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,800
And back then Canada ended up striking those laws down and made it legal to be a prostitute

104
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,040
but made it illegal to be a john or to live off the gains of somebody else's prostitution

105
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
like a pimp.

106
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,420
However, anybody who knows even a little bit about this topic will tell you that prostitution

107
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,840
in a brothel is generally a lot safer than walking the street.

108
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,380
She said there are stereotypes about indigenous women as hypersexed and decriminalizing prostitution

109
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,280
and seeing it as work would entrench those stereotypes because women would be choosing

110
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,940
to work in the sex industry.

111
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,500
So the possibility that women would choose to do this because that apparently reinforces

112
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,520
these negative stereotypes therefore you want to see it kept illegal.

113
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,380
There's an ongoing debate between institutionalized feminism and choice feminism which is basically

114
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,060
just this sentence in a nutshell.

115
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:16,580
Prostitution is built on a foundation of inequality so decriminalization would justify that inequality.

116
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,560
If it's a fair exchange where is the inequality?

117
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,520
Is there inequality because the woman needs money and the man has it and they're willing

118
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
to exchange sex for money?

119
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,280
Should she just get the money without having sex with him?

120
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,880
Is that where you're going to go with this?

121
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,040
Under cross-examination Smiley was asked several times about a line in her art piece in which

122
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,400
she characterizes those who see prostitution as sex work as racist white men who don't

123
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,840
care if indigenous women die.

124
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,900
Now I see prostitution as sex work, I want to see it legalized, and I do care if indigenous

125
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,900
women die.

126
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,520
In fact if there are a lot of indigenous prostitutes I think probably the best thing to do for

127
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,880
them is to get them into some kind of government regulated brothel instead of actually walking

128
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,400
the streets where they can be picked up by anybody and then dumped off in a ditch when

129
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,720
the guy's done with them.

130
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,380
It's true that there are women who advocate for prostitution as sex work who are women

131
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,180
but that there are also men and most of the buyers are men and they have a vested interest

132
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,120
to see it as work, Smiley said.

133
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,660
My vested interest to see it as work is not based on me fucking them because I have never

134
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,840
once actually been with a prostitute but it's because I don't want to see indigenous women

135
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,840
murdered and dumped off in the forest somewhere and ultimately that is what you are advocating

136
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
for here.

137
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,640
Smiley said she rejects the idea that decriminalization of prostitution or allowing women to work

138
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,920
in escort agencies for example is a form of harm reduction because in her view the very

139
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,460
act of prostitution is so harmful that the harm cannot be reduced.

140
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,660
And this is where the ideology is, alright?

141
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,700
This is where the radical feminist ideology comes into this.

142
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,120
Because it's not about individual women choosing to be prostitutes in a safe environment, it's

143
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,600
about the fabric of femininity or some other bullshit that she's going to pull out.

144
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,820
It's not about women's own choices, it's about her power structure.

145
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:07,040
Two defense witnesses testified earlier that the laws push the sex trade further underground

146
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,480
and put sex workers at a greater risk of harm.

147
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,480
Exactly.

148
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,140
But let's get away from violence committed against women and talk about violence committed

149
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,400
by women.

150
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,600
Women who killed husbands rarely gave a warning and most weren't abused, study finds.

151
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,500
The majority of the slayings, perpetuated by knife, gun and strangulation, appear generally

152
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,200
unheralded suggests the analysis of 20 years of Quebec homicide files.

153
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,880
Jesus, this is a terribly put together article.

154
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,860
Conventional wisdom suggests that women usually kill their spouses in self-defense or as a

155
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,540
final desperate reaction to chronic battery, the burning bed syndrome that is sometimes

156
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,420
cited as a defense in murder trials.

157
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,500
A new Canadian study, however, suggests that barely a quarter of husband killers are victims

158
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,980
of domestic abuse, less than half suffer from any identified psychological problem and fewer

159
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,100
still have had trouble with the police.

160
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,680
Well that's interesting, isn't it?

161
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,420
It's almost like the reasons that women kill people are just as wide and varied as men.

162
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,220
Women rarely give a warning before killing their mates, concluded the study, co-authored

163
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:12,380
by Dr. Dominique Bourget, a forensic psychiatrist at the Royal Ottawa Medical Health Centre.

164
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,620
In the vast majority of cases of women who killed their mates, there were very few indicators

165
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,840
that might have signaled the risk and helped predict the violent lethal behavior.

166
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:27,100
Although 35% of the male victims had a history of at least one act of past violence, the

167
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,820
researchers say they found evidence that just 26% of the women had been physically abused

168
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,420
by their partners.

169
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:38,180
That differs markedly from the findings of a 1989 American study that indicated almost

170
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,840
all women who committed spousal homicides did so in an environment of domestic abuse.

171
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,240
And a Canadian paper from the same period that attributed the motives for most such

172
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,560
killings to self-defense, notes the study.

173
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,540
To Don Dutton, a UBC psychology professor who has examined domestic violence for decades,

174
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,540
the results of the new study are no surprise, despite what he called an erroneous understanding

175
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,940
of intimate partner assault that continues to prevail in society.

176
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,260
We've got a stereotype about domestic violence, that the oppressor or perpetrator is the male,

177
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,500
and when female violence happens, it's a reaction against male violence.

178
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,520
The stereotype is so strong that when you look at the actual data, you're shocked.

179
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,520
Professor Dutton, author of the book Rethinking Domestic Violence, suggested that such assumptions

180
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,900
evolved from the feminist view that family violence was a sociopolitical act of patriarchal

181
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,820
men suppressing women.

182
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:30,980
He argues instead that personality disorders in both male and female offenders better explain

183
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,660
family violence than do social norms.

184
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,780
Maybe, maybe in reality not everything is about the patriarchy.

185
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:43,900
Maybe mental health issues are cross-gender and are far more important than bullshit ideologies.

186
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,780
Maybe it just turns out that women aren't these eternally pure beings always destined

187
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:53,980
to be the victim, but are human, just like men, and have all the same human downfalls

188
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,980
that men do.

189
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,300
Of course, saying that would be sexist.

190
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:02,460
And speaking of sexism, Trudeau government tells public service to end use of words like

191
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:08,860
mother, father, mister, missus, and forcing a switch to gender neutral language.

192
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,060
I mean, at least they're not making up pronouns, right?

193
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,020
In a change nobody asked for, the Trudeau government plans to ban frontline public service

194
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,340
workers from saying mister, missus, mother, and father.

195
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,580
That's according to a report by Radio Canada who gained access to government documents

196
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,220
stipulating the change.

197
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,300
Here are the key parts of that report.

198
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:34,040
According to documents obtained by Radio Canada, the French language arm of CBC, frontline

199
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,340
staff must now use gender neutral language or gender inclusive language.

200
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,740
This avoids portraying a perceived bias towards a particular sex or gender.

201
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,920
Says a copy of speaking notes prepared for managers and team leaders.

202
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,220
It is important that Service Canada as an organization reflects Canada's diverse population.

203
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,860
It ensures that the views and interests of Canadians are taken into account when we develop

204
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,280
policies, programs, services, and initiatives.

205
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,660
The new guidelines also rule out using terms such as mother and father because they are

206
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,340
gender specific and instead says the neutral term of parent should be used instead.

207
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:13,460
The same goes for honorifics such as mister, missus, and miss and in both languages.

208
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,060
Instead employees are being directed to address customers by their full names or ask them

209
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,580
what they want to be called.

210
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,500
After the official opposition raised serious questions about the proposal, Social Development

211
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,700
Minister, I can't fucking pronounce French names guys, clarified the measures in what

212
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,460
amounted to a desperate attempt to backtrack.

213
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,940
And here's some tweets here, let's be clear, Service Canada will continue to use mister

214
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,760
and miss when interacting with Canadians.

215
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,480
We are only confirming how people want to be addressed as a matter of respect.

216
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,320
We are proud that Service Canada reflects the diversity of Canada's population and is

217
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,220
working to adapt to the reality of 21st century families.

218
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,520
The way he presents it here is not really that big of a deal, right?

219
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,880
Like if you walk into Service Canada and you need something done and the person behind

220
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:02,160
the desk says, should I call you mister or missus or are you a mother or a father, it's

221
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,480
not really that big of a deal, is it?

222
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,660
That just seems a bit more like that overarching Canadian politeness that we've all come to

223
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,660
know and love.

224
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,360
But that's not quite what it is, is it?

225
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,320
That's not what the government document says according to the report.

226
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,300
Others are being told that they must use gender neutral language, not that they have

227
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,120
the choice of whether to use it.

228
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,360
The report notes that the document specifically rules out the use of terms like mother and

229
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
father.

230
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,680
This has been a usual tactic of the Trudeau government, who introduce some unpopular change

231
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,760
and then try to distract from what the change really is with some spin, while not actually

232
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,800
altering what they're doing behind the scenes.

233
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,480
In fact, reports already contradict this.

234
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,860
According to an official, who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized

235
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,060
to speak on the issue, the new directive is already in place and has led to some difficult

236
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,700
situations for civil servants.

237
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,820
It happens that when we talk to people and we ask, what is the name of parent number

238
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,820
one?

239
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,340
People do not understand, said the official.

240
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,980
Now that's the real problem, isn't it?

241
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,900
Because if you have two parents and you can't differentiate them by something like gender,

242
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,980
you have to place them in a numbered order, you have to go parent one and parent two or

243
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,760
parent three or four if there are some real fucking degenerates out there.

244
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:16,040
But the point is, in trying to avoid a gendered hierarchy of male and female, they are specifically

245
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,000
making a new hierarchy that is simply numbered.

246
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,840
So if the father is parent number one and the mother is parent number two, in my opinion,

247
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,900
that's a far stricter hierarchy than the man woman.

248
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,680
And really this is part of the larger problem of changing language to try and deny reality.

249
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,880
Like there are new stories coming out of schools banning the concept of best friends.

250
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,560
So if you have one friend that you're really close to, like Dave and I, if Dave and I were

251
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,360
best friends, we've been best friends since we were five years old, but that would be

252
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
banned now.

253
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,840
It's like, no, you can't be best friends with them.

254
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,040
You have to equally play with everybody else in the playground now while you're at school.

255
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,440
I mean, are they going to project that into the private life too?

256
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,160
Say that kids can't hang out with each other disproportionately more than other kids when

257
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,320
school's out?

258
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,900
Let's end on Lindsay Shepherd and the Faith Goldie talk at Laurier University.

259
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,460
Here's a tweet by Adida Choudhury, I guess.

260
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,380
I'm really proud and relieved that not only did you show Faith Goldie that her presence

261
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:15,340
is unwelcome at Laurier, you did so with grace and peacefully and nobody was hurt.

262
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,000
I want to hear more about all of you who made no Nazis at Laurier possible.

263
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,700
What happened here was that Faith Goldie, who is a right wing, white identitarian, was

264
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,360
set up by Lindsay Shepherd to give a talk at Wilfrid Laurier University.

265
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,660
I said this in How Cook Does Canada Part 3.

266
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,920
I don't agree with anything that Faith Goldie says, but I wouldn't kick her off a campus.

267
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,000
It's more important to hear her ideas and debate them, even if just in your own head,

268
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,120
than it is to censor her.

269
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,000
But this person here is proud that somebody pulled the fire alarm or had the talk cancelled,

270
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,800
and Lindsay Shepherd had this to say about him.

271
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,000
It is not peaceful or graceful to pull a fire alarm to shut down a speaker's talk.

272
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,840
This kind of mindset is absolutely deranged and pathological.

273
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,280
People who derive pleasure from censoring others are sick and sad individuals.

274
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,860
And really, I have to agree.

275
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,140
The people who pulled the fire alarm and the people who support the fire alarm being pulled

276
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,860
on Faith Goldie, what did they actually accomplish?

277
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,220
Did they refute any of her ideas?

278
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,040
Well, no, they didn't.

279
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,460
Did they directly confront her?

280
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,060
No.

281
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,740
Did they present their own arguments?

282
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,180
Absolutely not.

283
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,760
This turns Faith Goldie into a martyr, which is absolutely something that we don't want.

284
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,580
We want to be able to debate people like Faith Goldie.

285
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,240
We want rationally-minded liberals to be in the audience and in the questioning lineup

286
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,200
for Faith Goldie's talks, and put to her the hard questions.

287
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,680
The questions that Faith Goldie can't answer.

288
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,560
The questions that, if asked, might actually leave Faith Goldie with egg on her face.

289
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,400
But when you get her event cancelled, the only thing that you're proving is that you're

290
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
afraid of her.

291
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,260
You're not strong, you're not graceful, you're not peaceful, and you're certainly not brave.

292
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,720
You're just being cowards.

293
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,300
I'll have more to say on the Lindsay Shepherd topic in the coming weeks.

294
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,020
I'm still working on How Cucked is Canada For, which is all about Jordan Peterson.

295
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,220
You're not going to see that next week, but you will probably see it the week after, because

296
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,540
there is quite a lot to go through.

297
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,980
But that about does it for this week.

298
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,380
Happy Canada Day, everybody!

299
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,580

301
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,380
And if you also like video games, I stream a variety of fun stuff five evenings a week

302
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,440
over on my Twitch channel as well.

303
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,260
So drop by and say hi sometime.

304
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,260
I hope to see you there.

305
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,760
I love you.
