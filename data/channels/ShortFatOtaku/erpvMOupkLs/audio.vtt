00:00.000 --> 00:04.440
Hey guys, welcome to SJ Weekly for July 1st, 2018.

00:04.440 --> 00:06.280
And you know what that means, right?

00:06.280 --> 00:27.120
It's Canada Day!

00:27.120 --> 00:32.400
Let's spend today going over some of the most ridiculous Canadian SJW bullshit I can

00:32.400 --> 00:33.400
find.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.960
And why don't we start at the top with Justin Trudeau?

00:35.960 --> 00:41.320
To those who marched here in Canada for an end to gun violence, we hear you, and this

00:41.320 --> 00:45.720
week we introduced a plan for common sense gun control that will keep our communities

00:45.720 --> 00:46.720
safer.

00:46.720 --> 00:52.760
This was on March 24th, 2018, meaning that it was happening around the whole Emma Gonzalez-David

00:52.760 --> 00:55.440
Hogg school shooting bullshit in the states.

00:55.440 --> 01:00.080
Well, even though Canada already has stricter gun laws than the states, a bunch of Canadians

01:00.080 --> 01:01.560
still marched in support.

01:01.560 --> 01:04.200
And Trudeau took this opportunity to do some virtue signalling.

01:04.200 --> 01:07.000
Let's actually read that legislation though.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.360
Firearms legislation to make communities safer.

01:09.360 --> 01:13.760
Crime rates generally in Canada have been on the decline for more than two decades,

01:13.760 --> 01:18.660
but offences involving firearms have become more prevalent, especially since 2013.

01:18.660 --> 01:22.640
Many communities across the country have been facing a steady increase in gun violence over

01:22.640 --> 01:23.960
the past five years.

01:23.960 --> 01:30.360
Gun-related homicides, domestic and gender-based violence involving guns, criminal gang activity,

01:30.360 --> 01:32.840
and gun thefts are all up significantly.

01:32.840 --> 01:37.040
To keep communities safe, the government of Canada is strengthening Canada's gun laws

01:37.040 --> 01:40.320
in a common-sense, focused, and effective way.

01:40.320 --> 01:44.760
Legislation introduced today prioritizes public safety and effective police work, while respecting

01:44.760 --> 01:46.720
law-abiding firearms owners.

01:46.720 --> 01:50.040
This government will not bring back the federal long gun registry.

01:50.040 --> 01:54.880
Now, all of those problems there, the gun-related homicides, domestic and gender-based violence

01:54.880 --> 02:01.000
involving guns, criminal gang activity, and gun thefts, those are all already illegal,

02:01.000 --> 02:06.560
and a lot of those, especially the gang violence, are committed with illegally owned guns anyway.

02:06.560 --> 02:11.400
So I'm not exactly sure what stricter regulations on guns is going to do to help with something

02:11.400 --> 02:13.360
like criminal gang activity.

02:13.360 --> 02:17.880
The first four points on this list are at least somewhat reasonable, so I'm not going

02:17.880 --> 02:20.080
to go over them, but let's talk about point five here.

02:20.080 --> 02:25.600
The new legislation proposes to bolster community safety in relation to restricted and prohibited

02:25.600 --> 02:29.140
firearms, mostly handguns and assault weapons.

02:29.140 --> 02:33.760
The term assault weapon is one of those weasel words that doesn't really mean anything in

02:33.760 --> 02:37.120
terms of any kind of real-world gun classification.

02:37.120 --> 02:41.960
It's a very vague, very general idea that doesn't actually correspond to any class of

02:41.960 --> 02:43.320
gun in reality.

02:43.320 --> 02:48.640
So whenever I see some kind of gun legislation bring up assault weapons, to me that basically

02:48.640 --> 02:53.500
means that they're looking to heavily restrict things based on vague criteria.

02:53.500 --> 02:56.760
And considering that the Democrats in the United States have been using this term to

02:56.760 --> 03:01.200
try and do the same thing for the past 20 years or so, I'm not surprised to see it here.

03:01.200 --> 03:05.480
But while we're on the topic of government legislative ineffectualness, decriminalizing

03:05.480 --> 03:08.640
prostitution would negatively impact Indigenous women.

03:08.640 --> 03:13.440
A London, Ontario court is hearing arguments about the constitutionality of Canada's prostitution

03:13.440 --> 03:14.440
laws.

03:14.440 --> 03:19.000
An academic testifying about Canada's prostitution laws says decriminalization would disproportionately

03:19.000 --> 03:21.260
affect Indigenous women and girls.

03:21.260 --> 03:27.320
Even in a system where prostitution is legal, if you have girls working as prostitutes and

03:27.320 --> 03:30.020
not just women, you have a whole other problem.

03:30.020 --> 03:33.680
Indigenous women are now overrepresented in the sex industry, but there's no evidence

03:33.680 --> 03:39.680
that prostitution existed prior to colonization, said Cherry Smiley, an academic who studies

03:39.680 --> 03:43.020
the impact of prostitution on the lives of Indigenous women and girls.

03:43.020 --> 03:47.560
Well first of all, Cherry Smiley, are you sure that that's not your own prostitute name?

03:47.560 --> 03:49.040
Because it kind of sounds like it might be.

03:49.040 --> 03:53.960
But this idea that prostitution didn't exist prior to colonization, it's called the oldest

03:53.960 --> 03:56.660
profession in the world for a reason.

03:56.660 --> 04:01.360
Even if Canada's native population hadn't invented money yet on the time of European

04:01.360 --> 04:07.320
contact, I'm sure there were still women out there who traded sex for other things.

04:07.320 --> 04:12.700
For goods, or for protection, or for access to certain lands, or whatever.

04:12.700 --> 04:17.720
Because the truth is, Indigenous women are human too, and there is always some kind of

04:17.720 --> 04:19.920
sex trade wherever humans go.

04:19.920 --> 04:25.680
I honestly thought it was racist nowadays to believe in the idea of the noble savage.

04:25.680 --> 04:30.120
The underlying ideology of sex buyers is that they can buy a woman and engage in sex on

04:30.120 --> 04:31.920
his terms, Smiley said.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.920
Well no, you've got that completely wrong.

04:33.920 --> 04:38.460
You call them sex buyers because they're not buying a woman, they're buying sex.

04:38.460 --> 04:42.320
They're not purchasing a good, they're obtaining a service.

04:42.320 --> 04:48.380
For example, if you were to call me, say, a meal buyer, and then using this sentence

04:48.380 --> 04:54.520
structure you could say that I go to a restaurant, I buy a waitress, and I engage in her serving

04:54.520 --> 04:56.660
me food on my terms.

04:56.660 --> 05:00.080
And then that arrangement ends when I've finished the meal I've paid and I've left the restaurant.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.400
It's the same thing with prostitutes.

05:02.400 --> 05:06.520
You don't actually buy the woman, you don't actually buy the waitress.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.120
You buy the food and you eat it.

05:08.120 --> 05:10.400
Or you buy the sex, but you don't buy the person.

05:10.400 --> 05:14.680
In essence, the sex buyer is paying for a service and there is a reasonable expectation

05:14.680 --> 05:16.320
that that service is provided.

05:16.320 --> 05:19.440
You can say that all these women don't want to do it, they're just doing it for the money.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.520
Well, that's most jobs.

05:21.520 --> 05:24.080
Most people don't want to be waitresses or waiters.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.120
They do it for the money.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.980
Most people don't want to go work in a factory.

05:26.980 --> 05:28.040
They do it for the money.

05:28.040 --> 05:32.440
Most people don't want to collect garbage or plow roads, but they do it for the money.

05:32.440 --> 05:33.440
This is no different.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.120
Smiley was the crown's first witness.

05:35.120 --> 05:38.920
She's an indigenous woman who has done an art exhibit with women who work in prostitution

05:38.920 --> 05:42.680
and she has worked with women who have suffered abuse and sexual violence.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.600
Those two things are very different and I don't know why this article conflates them

05:45.600 --> 05:46.600
in this way.

05:46.600 --> 05:50.160
The court case centers around a London couple who was charged after the escort agency they

05:50.160 --> 05:55.520
were running, Fantasy World Escorts, was shut down by London police in November 2015.

05:55.520 --> 05:59.960
Their lawyers are arguing that three of the charges, procuring, advertising, and materially

05:59.960 --> 06:04.520
benefiting from the sexual services of someone else, violate sex workers' constitutional

06:04.520 --> 06:06.200
right to the security of the person.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.200
And that's actually true.

06:07.200 --> 06:13.040
I think it was back in 2012 prostitution was just straight up illegal in Canada and another

06:13.040 --> 06:18.400
court case heard making it illegal for prostitutes to engage in sex work made it disproportionately

06:18.400 --> 06:23.080
unsafe and that that level of unsafety was driven only by government intervention.

06:23.120 --> 06:27.800
And back then Canada ended up striking those laws down and made it legal to be a prostitute

06:27.800 --> 06:32.040
but made it illegal to be a john or to live off the gains of somebody else's prostitution

06:32.040 --> 06:33.040
like a pimp.

06:33.040 --> 06:37.420
However, anybody who knows even a little bit about this topic will tell you that prostitution

06:37.420 --> 06:41.840
in a brothel is generally a lot safer than walking the street.

06:41.840 --> 06:46.380
She said there are stereotypes about indigenous women as hypersexed and decriminalizing prostitution

06:46.380 --> 06:51.280
and seeing it as work would entrench those stereotypes because women would be choosing

06:51.280 --> 06:52.940
to work in the sex industry.

06:52.940 --> 06:58.500
So the possibility that women would choose to do this because that apparently reinforces

06:58.500 --> 07:02.520
these negative stereotypes therefore you want to see it kept illegal.

07:02.520 --> 07:08.380
There's an ongoing debate between institutionalized feminism and choice feminism which is basically

07:08.380 --> 07:11.060
just this sentence in a nutshell.

07:11.060 --> 07:16.580
Prostitution is built on a foundation of inequality so decriminalization would justify that inequality.

07:16.580 --> 07:19.560
If it's a fair exchange where is the inequality?

07:19.560 --> 07:23.520
Is there inequality because the woman needs money and the man has it and they're willing

07:23.520 --> 07:25.520
to exchange sex for money?

07:25.520 --> 07:28.280
Should she just get the money without having sex with him?

07:28.280 --> 07:29.880
Is that where you're going to go with this?

07:29.880 --> 07:35.040
Under cross-examination Smiley was asked several times about a line in her art piece in which

07:35.040 --> 07:41.400
she characterizes those who see prostitution as sex work as racist white men who don't

07:41.400 --> 07:43.840
care if indigenous women die.

07:43.840 --> 07:49.900
Now I see prostitution as sex work, I want to see it legalized, and I do care if indigenous

07:49.900 --> 07:50.900
women die.

07:50.900 --> 07:55.520
In fact if there are a lot of indigenous prostitutes I think probably the best thing to do for

07:55.520 --> 08:00.880
them is to get them into some kind of government regulated brothel instead of actually walking

08:00.880 --> 08:04.400
the streets where they can be picked up by anybody and then dumped off in a ditch when

08:04.400 --> 08:05.720
the guy's done with them.

08:05.720 --> 08:09.380
It's true that there are women who advocate for prostitution as sex work who are women

08:09.380 --> 08:13.180
but that there are also men and most of the buyers are men and they have a vested interest

08:13.180 --> 08:15.120
to see it as work, Smiley said.

08:15.120 --> 08:19.660
My vested interest to see it as work is not based on me fucking them because I have never

08:19.660 --> 08:23.840
once actually been with a prostitute but it's because I don't want to see indigenous women

08:23.840 --> 08:28.840
murdered and dumped off in the forest somewhere and ultimately that is what you are advocating

08:28.840 --> 08:29.840
for here.

08:29.840 --> 08:34.640
Smiley said she rejects the idea that decriminalization of prostitution or allowing women to work

08:34.640 --> 08:39.920
in escort agencies for example is a form of harm reduction because in her view the very

08:39.920 --> 08:44.460
act of prostitution is so harmful that the harm cannot be reduced.

08:44.460 --> 08:46.660
And this is where the ideology is, alright?

08:46.660 --> 08:49.700
This is where the radical feminist ideology comes into this.

08:49.700 --> 08:54.120
Because it's not about individual women choosing to be prostitutes in a safe environment, it's

08:54.120 --> 08:58.600
about the fabric of femininity or some other bullshit that she's going to pull out.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.820
It's not about women's own choices, it's about her power structure.

09:01.820 --> 09:07.040
Two defense witnesses testified earlier that the laws push the sex trade further underground

09:07.040 --> 09:09.480
and put sex workers at a greater risk of harm.

09:09.480 --> 09:10.480
Exactly.

09:10.480 --> 09:14.140
But let's get away from violence committed against women and talk about violence committed

09:14.140 --> 09:15.400
by women.

09:15.400 --> 09:20.600
Women who killed husbands rarely gave a warning and most weren't abused, study finds.

09:20.600 --> 09:25.500
The majority of the slayings, perpetuated by knife, gun and strangulation, appear generally

09:25.500 --> 09:29.200
unheralded suggests the analysis of 20 years of Quebec homicide files.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.880
Jesus, this is a terribly put together article.

09:31.880 --> 09:35.860
Conventional wisdom suggests that women usually kill their spouses in self-defense or as a

09:35.860 --> 09:40.540
final desperate reaction to chronic battery, the burning bed syndrome that is sometimes

09:40.540 --> 09:43.420
cited as a defense in murder trials.

09:43.420 --> 09:48.500
A new Canadian study, however, suggests that barely a quarter of husband killers are victims

09:48.500 --> 09:53.980
of domestic abuse, less than half suffer from any identified psychological problem and fewer

09:53.980 --> 09:56.100
still have had trouble with the police.

09:56.100 --> 09:57.680
Well that's interesting, isn't it?

09:57.680 --> 10:03.420
It's almost like the reasons that women kill people are just as wide and varied as men.

10:03.420 --> 10:07.220
Women rarely give a warning before killing their mates, concluded the study, co-authored

10:07.220 --> 10:12.380
by Dr. Dominique Bourget, a forensic psychiatrist at the Royal Ottawa Medical Health Centre.

10:12.380 --> 10:16.620
In the vast majority of cases of women who killed their mates, there were very few indicators

10:16.620 --> 10:20.840
that might have signaled the risk and helped predict the violent lethal behavior.

10:20.840 --> 10:27.100
Although 35% of the male victims had a history of at least one act of past violence, the

10:27.100 --> 10:31.820
researchers say they found evidence that just 26% of the women had been physically abused

10:31.820 --> 10:33.420
by their partners.

10:33.420 --> 10:38.180
That differs markedly from the findings of a 1989 American study that indicated almost

10:38.180 --> 10:42.840
all women who committed spousal homicides did so in an environment of domestic abuse.

10:42.840 --> 10:46.240
And a Canadian paper from the same period that attributed the motives for most such

10:46.240 --> 10:48.560
killings to self-defense, notes the study.

10:48.560 --> 10:53.540
To Don Dutton, a UBC psychology professor who has examined domestic violence for decades,

10:53.540 --> 10:57.540
the results of the new study are no surprise, despite what he called an erroneous understanding

10:57.540 --> 11:00.940
of intimate partner assault that continues to prevail in society.

11:00.940 --> 11:05.260
We've got a stereotype about domestic violence, that the oppressor or perpetrator is the male,

11:05.260 --> 11:08.500
and when female violence happens, it's a reaction against male violence.

11:08.500 --> 11:12.520
The stereotype is so strong that when you look at the actual data, you're shocked.

11:12.520 --> 11:17.520
Professor Dutton, author of the book Rethinking Domestic Violence, suggested that such assumptions

11:17.520 --> 11:22.900
evolved from the feminist view that family violence was a sociopolitical act of patriarchal

11:22.900 --> 11:24.820
men suppressing women.

11:24.820 --> 11:30.980
He argues instead that personality disorders in both male and female offenders better explain

11:30.980 --> 11:33.660
family violence than do social norms.

11:33.660 --> 11:37.780
Maybe, maybe in reality not everything is about the patriarchy.

11:37.780 --> 11:43.900
Maybe mental health issues are cross-gender and are far more important than bullshit ideologies.

11:43.900 --> 11:48.780
Maybe it just turns out that women aren't these eternally pure beings always destined

11:48.780 --> 11:53.980
to be the victim, but are human, just like men, and have all the same human downfalls

11:53.980 --> 11:54.980
that men do.

11:54.980 --> 11:57.300
Of course, saying that would be sexist.

11:57.300 --> 12:02.460
And speaking of sexism, Trudeau government tells public service to end use of words like

12:02.460 --> 12:08.860
mother, father, mister, missus, and forcing a switch to gender neutral language.

12:08.860 --> 12:12.060
I mean, at least they're not making up pronouns, right?

12:12.060 --> 12:17.020
In a change nobody asked for, the Trudeau government plans to ban frontline public service

12:17.020 --> 12:21.340
workers from saying mister, missus, mother, and father.

12:21.340 --> 12:25.580
That's according to a report by Radio Canada who gained access to government documents

12:25.580 --> 12:27.220
stipulating the change.

12:27.220 --> 12:29.300
Here are the key parts of that report.

12:29.300 --> 12:34.040
According to documents obtained by Radio Canada, the French language arm of CBC, frontline

12:34.040 --> 12:39.340
staff must now use gender neutral language or gender inclusive language.

12:39.340 --> 12:42.740
This avoids portraying a perceived bias towards a particular sex or gender.

12:42.740 --> 12:45.920
Says a copy of speaking notes prepared for managers and team leaders.

12:45.920 --> 12:51.220
It is important that Service Canada as an organization reflects Canada's diverse population.

12:51.220 --> 12:54.860
It ensures that the views and interests of Canadians are taken into account when we develop

12:54.860 --> 12:58.280
policies, programs, services, and initiatives.

12:58.280 --> 13:02.660
The new guidelines also rule out using terms such as mother and father because they are

13:02.660 --> 13:07.340
gender specific and instead says the neutral term of parent should be used instead.

13:07.340 --> 13:13.460
The same goes for honorifics such as mister, missus, and miss and in both languages.

13:13.460 --> 13:17.060
Instead employees are being directed to address customers by their full names or ask them

13:17.060 --> 13:18.580
what they want to be called.

13:18.580 --> 13:23.500
After the official opposition raised serious questions about the proposal, Social Development

13:23.500 --> 13:28.700
Minister, I can't fucking pronounce French names guys, clarified the measures in what

13:28.700 --> 13:31.460
amounted to a desperate attempt to backtrack.

13:31.460 --> 13:35.940
And here's some tweets here, let's be clear, Service Canada will continue to use mister

13:35.940 --> 13:38.760
and miss when interacting with Canadians.

13:38.760 --> 13:42.480
We are only confirming how people want to be addressed as a matter of respect.

13:42.480 --> 13:46.320
We are proud that Service Canada reflects the diversity of Canada's population and is

13:46.320 --> 13:49.220
working to adapt to the reality of 21st century families.

13:49.220 --> 13:52.520
The way he presents it here is not really that big of a deal, right?

13:52.520 --> 13:55.880
Like if you walk into Service Canada and you need something done and the person behind

13:55.880 --> 14:02.160
the desk says, should I call you mister or missus or are you a mother or a father, it's

14:02.160 --> 14:03.480
not really that big of a deal, is it?

14:03.480 --> 14:07.660
That just seems a bit more like that overarching Canadian politeness that we've all come to

14:07.660 --> 14:08.660
know and love.

14:08.660 --> 14:10.360
But that's not quite what it is, is it?

14:10.360 --> 14:13.320
That's not what the government document says according to the report.

14:13.320 --> 14:17.300
Others are being told that they must use gender neutral language, not that they have

14:17.300 --> 14:19.120
the choice of whether to use it.

14:19.120 --> 14:23.360
The report notes that the document specifically rules out the use of terms like mother and

14:23.360 --> 14:24.360
father.

14:24.360 --> 14:28.680
This has been a usual tactic of the Trudeau government, who introduce some unpopular change

14:28.680 --> 14:32.760
and then try to distract from what the change really is with some spin, while not actually

14:32.760 --> 14:34.800
altering what they're doing behind the scenes.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.480
In fact, reports already contradict this.

14:37.480 --> 14:40.860
According to an official, who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized

14:40.860 --> 14:45.060
to speak on the issue, the new directive is already in place and has led to some difficult

14:45.060 --> 14:46.700
situations for civil servants.

14:46.700 --> 14:51.820
It happens that when we talk to people and we ask, what is the name of parent number

14:51.820 --> 14:52.820
one?

14:52.820 --> 14:54.340
People do not understand, said the official.

14:54.340 --> 14:55.980
Now that's the real problem, isn't it?

14:55.980 --> 15:00.900
Because if you have two parents and you can't differentiate them by something like gender,

15:00.900 --> 15:05.980
you have to place them in a numbered order, you have to go parent one and parent two or

15:05.980 --> 15:09.760
parent three or four if there are some real fucking degenerates out there.

15:09.760 --> 15:16.040
But the point is, in trying to avoid a gendered hierarchy of male and female, they are specifically

15:16.040 --> 15:20.000
making a new hierarchy that is simply numbered.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.840
So if the father is parent number one and the mother is parent number two, in my opinion,

15:24.840 --> 15:27.900
that's a far stricter hierarchy than the man woman.

15:27.900 --> 15:32.680
And really this is part of the larger problem of changing language to try and deny reality.

15:32.680 --> 15:36.880
Like there are new stories coming out of schools banning the concept of best friends.

15:36.880 --> 15:41.560
So if you have one friend that you're really close to, like Dave and I, if Dave and I were

15:41.560 --> 15:44.360
best friends, we've been best friends since we were five years old, but that would be

15:44.360 --> 15:45.360
banned now.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.840
It's like, no, you can't be best friends with them.

15:46.840 --> 15:50.040
You have to equally play with everybody else in the playground now while you're at school.

15:50.040 --> 15:53.440
I mean, are they going to project that into the private life too?

15:53.440 --> 15:57.160
Say that kids can't hang out with each other disproportionately more than other kids when

15:57.160 --> 15:58.320
school's out?

15:58.320 --> 16:02.900
Let's end on Lindsay Shepherd and the Faith Goldie talk at Laurier University.

16:02.900 --> 16:06.460
Here's a tweet by Adida Choudhury, I guess.

16:06.460 --> 16:10.380
I'm really proud and relieved that not only did you show Faith Goldie that her presence

16:10.380 --> 16:15.340
is unwelcome at Laurier, you did so with grace and peacefully and nobody was hurt.

16:15.340 --> 16:20.000
I want to hear more about all of you who made no Nazis at Laurier possible.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.700
What happened here was that Faith Goldie, who is a right wing, white identitarian, was

16:25.700 --> 16:29.360
set up by Lindsay Shepherd to give a talk at Wilfrid Laurier University.

16:29.360 --> 16:31.660
I said this in How Cook Does Canada Part 3.

16:31.660 --> 16:36.920
I don't agree with anything that Faith Goldie says, but I wouldn't kick her off a campus.

16:36.920 --> 16:42.000
It's more important to hear her ideas and debate them, even if just in your own head,

16:42.000 --> 16:43.120
than it is to censor her.

16:43.120 --> 16:47.000
But this person here is proud that somebody pulled the fire alarm or had the talk cancelled,

16:47.000 --> 16:48.800
and Lindsay Shepherd had this to say about him.

16:48.800 --> 16:54.000
It is not peaceful or graceful to pull a fire alarm to shut down a speaker's talk.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.840
This kind of mindset is absolutely deranged and pathological.

16:57.840 --> 17:02.280
People who derive pleasure from censoring others are sick and sad individuals.

17:02.280 --> 17:03.860
And really, I have to agree.

17:03.860 --> 17:08.140
The people who pulled the fire alarm and the people who support the fire alarm being pulled

17:08.140 --> 17:12.860
on Faith Goldie, what did they actually accomplish?

17:12.860 --> 17:15.220
Did they refute any of her ideas?

17:15.220 --> 17:18.040
Well, no, they didn't.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.460
Did they directly confront her?

17:20.460 --> 17:22.060
No.

17:22.060 --> 17:24.740
Did they present their own arguments?

17:24.740 --> 17:26.180
Absolutely not.

17:26.180 --> 17:30.760
This turns Faith Goldie into a martyr, which is absolutely something that we don't want.

17:30.760 --> 17:33.580
We want to be able to debate people like Faith Goldie.

17:33.580 --> 17:38.240
We want rationally-minded liberals to be in the audience and in the questioning lineup

17:38.240 --> 17:42.200
for Faith Goldie's talks, and put to her the hard questions.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.680
The questions that Faith Goldie can't answer.

17:44.680 --> 17:49.560
The questions that, if asked, might actually leave Faith Goldie with egg on her face.

17:49.560 --> 17:53.400
But when you get her event cancelled, the only thing that you're proving is that you're

17:53.400 --> 17:54.400
afraid of her.

17:54.540 --> 17:59.260
You're not strong, you're not graceful, you're not peaceful, and you're certainly not brave.

17:59.260 --> 18:00.720
You're just being cowards.

18:00.720 --> 18:05.300
I'll have more to say on the Lindsay Shepherd topic in the coming weeks.

18:05.300 --> 18:10.020
I'm still working on How Cucked is Canada For, which is all about Jordan Peterson.

18:10.020 --> 18:14.220
You're not going to see that next week, but you will probably see it the week after, because

18:14.220 --> 18:16.540
there is quite a lot to go through.

18:16.540 --> 18:17.980
But that about does it for this week.

18:17.980 --> 18:19.380
Happy Canada Day, everybody!

18:19.380 --> 18:23.580
If you enjoy this content and the other stuff that I do, please consider clicking on that

18:23.580 --> 18:26.280
Patreon link, because I could use the help right now.

18:26.280 --> 18:31.380
And if you also like video games, I stream a variety of fun stuff five evenings a week

18:31.380 --> 18:33.440
over on my Twitch channel as well.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.260
So drop by and say hi sometime.

18:35.260 --> 18:36.260
I hope to see you there.

18:36.260 --> 18:36.760
I love you.
