0	4440	Hey guys, welcome to SJ Weekly for July 1st, 2018.
4440	6280	And you know what that means, right?
6280	27120	It's Canada Day!
27120	32400	Let's spend today going over some of the most ridiculous Canadian SJW bullshit I can
32400	33400	find.
33400	35960	And why don't we start at the top with Justin Trudeau?
35960	41320	To those who marched here in Canada for an end to gun violence, we hear you, and this
41320	45720	week we introduced a plan for common sense gun control that will keep our communities
45720	46720	safer.
46720	52760	This was on March 24th, 2018, meaning that it was happening around the whole Emma Gonzalez-David
52760	55440	Hogg school shooting bullshit in the states.
55440	60080	Well, even though Canada already has stricter gun laws than the states, a bunch of Canadians
60080	61560	still marched in support.
61560	64200	And Trudeau took this opportunity to do some virtue signalling.
64200	67000	Let's actually read that legislation though.
67000	69360	Firearms legislation to make communities safer.
69360	73760	Crime rates generally in Canada have been on the decline for more than two decades,
73760	78660	but offences involving firearms have become more prevalent, especially since 2013.
78660	82640	Many communities across the country have been facing a steady increase in gun violence over
82640	83960	the past five years.
83960	90360	Gun-related homicides, domestic and gender-based violence involving guns, criminal gang activity,
90360	92840	and gun thefts are all up significantly.
92840	97040	To keep communities safe, the government of Canada is strengthening Canada's gun laws
97040	100320	in a common-sense, focused, and effective way.
100320	104760	Legislation introduced today prioritizes public safety and effective police work, while respecting
104760	106720	law-abiding firearms owners.
106720	110040	This government will not bring back the federal long gun registry.
110040	114880	Now, all of those problems there, the gun-related homicides, domestic and gender-based violence
114880	121000	involving guns, criminal gang activity, and gun thefts, those are all already illegal,
121000	126560	and a lot of those, especially the gang violence, are committed with illegally owned guns anyway.
126560	131400	So I'm not exactly sure what stricter regulations on guns is going to do to help with something
131400	133360	like criminal gang activity.
133360	137880	The first four points on this list are at least somewhat reasonable, so I'm not going
137880	140080	to go over them, but let's talk about point five here.
140080	145600	The new legislation proposes to bolster community safety in relation to restricted and prohibited
145600	149140	firearms, mostly handguns and assault weapons.
149140	153760	The term assault weapon is one of those weasel words that doesn't really mean anything in
153760	157120	terms of any kind of real-world gun classification.
157120	161960	It's a very vague, very general idea that doesn't actually correspond to any class of
161960	163320	gun in reality.
163320	168640	So whenever I see some kind of gun legislation bring up assault weapons, to me that basically
168640	173500	means that they're looking to heavily restrict things based on vague criteria.
173500	176760	And considering that the Democrats in the United States have been using this term to
176760	181200	try and do the same thing for the past 20 years or so, I'm not surprised to see it here.
181200	185480	But while we're on the topic of government legislative ineffectualness, decriminalizing
185480	188640	prostitution would negatively impact Indigenous women.
188640	193440	A London, Ontario court is hearing arguments about the constitutionality of Canada's prostitution
193440	194440	laws.
194440	199000	An academic testifying about Canada's prostitution laws says decriminalization would disproportionately
199000	201260	affect Indigenous women and girls.
201260	207320	Even in a system where prostitution is legal, if you have girls working as prostitutes and
207320	210020	not just women, you have a whole other problem.
210020	213680	Indigenous women are now overrepresented in the sex industry, but there's no evidence
213680	219680	that prostitution existed prior to colonization, said Cherry Smiley, an academic who studies
219680	223020	the impact of prostitution on the lives of Indigenous women and girls.
223020	227560	Well first of all, Cherry Smiley, are you sure that that's not your own prostitute name?
227560	229040	Because it kind of sounds like it might be.
229040	233960	But this idea that prostitution didn't exist prior to colonization, it's called the oldest
233960	236660	profession in the world for a reason.
236660	241360	Even if Canada's native population hadn't invented money yet on the time of European
241360	247320	contact, I'm sure there were still women out there who traded sex for other things.
247320	252700	For goods, or for protection, or for access to certain lands, or whatever.
252700	257720	Because the truth is, Indigenous women are human too, and there is always some kind of
257720	259920	sex trade wherever humans go.
259920	265680	I honestly thought it was racist nowadays to believe in the idea of the noble savage.
265680	270120	The underlying ideology of sex buyers is that they can buy a woman and engage in sex on
270120	271920	his terms, Smiley said.
271920	273920	Well no, you've got that completely wrong.
273920	278460	You call them sex buyers because they're not buying a woman, they're buying sex.
278460	282320	They're not purchasing a good, they're obtaining a service.
282320	288380	For example, if you were to call me, say, a meal buyer, and then using this sentence
288380	294520	structure you could say that I go to a restaurant, I buy a waitress, and I engage in her serving
294520	296660	me food on my terms.
296660	300080	And then that arrangement ends when I've finished the meal I've paid and I've left the restaurant.
300080	302400	It's the same thing with prostitutes.
302400	306520	You don't actually buy the woman, you don't actually buy the waitress.
306520	308120	You buy the food and you eat it.
308120	310400	Or you buy the sex, but you don't buy the person.
310400	314680	In essence, the sex buyer is paying for a service and there is a reasonable expectation
314680	316320	that that service is provided.
316320	319440	You can say that all these women don't want to do it, they're just doing it for the money.
319440	321520	Well, that's most jobs.
321520	324080	Most people don't want to be waitresses or waiters.
324080	325120	They do it for the money.
325120	326980	Most people don't want to go work in a factory.
326980	328040	They do it for the money.
328040	332440	Most people don't want to collect garbage or plow roads, but they do it for the money.
332440	333440	This is no different.
333440	335120	Smiley was the crown's first witness.
335120	338920	She's an indigenous woman who has done an art exhibit with women who work in prostitution
338920	342680	and she has worked with women who have suffered abuse and sexual violence.
342680	345600	Those two things are very different and I don't know why this article conflates them
345600	346600	in this way.
346600	350160	The court case centers around a London couple who was charged after the escort agency they
350160	355520	were running, Fantasy World Escorts, was shut down by London police in November 2015.
355520	359960	Their lawyers are arguing that three of the charges, procuring, advertising, and materially
359960	364520	benefiting from the sexual services of someone else, violate sex workers' constitutional
364520	366200	right to the security of the person.
366200	367200	And that's actually true.
367200	373040	I think it was back in 2012 prostitution was just straight up illegal in Canada and another
373040	378400	court case heard making it illegal for prostitutes to engage in sex work made it disproportionately
378400	383080	unsafe and that that level of unsafety was driven only by government intervention.
383120	387800	And back then Canada ended up striking those laws down and made it legal to be a prostitute
387800	392040	but made it illegal to be a john or to live off the gains of somebody else's prostitution
392040	393040	like a pimp.
393040	397420	However, anybody who knows even a little bit about this topic will tell you that prostitution
397420	401840	in a brothel is generally a lot safer than walking the street.
401840	406380	She said there are stereotypes about indigenous women as hypersexed and decriminalizing prostitution
406380	411280	and seeing it as work would entrench those stereotypes because women would be choosing
411280	412940	to work in the sex industry.
412940	418500	So the possibility that women would choose to do this because that apparently reinforces
418500	422520	these negative stereotypes therefore you want to see it kept illegal.
422520	428380	There's an ongoing debate between institutionalized feminism and choice feminism which is basically
428380	431060	just this sentence in a nutshell.
431060	436580	Prostitution is built on a foundation of inequality so decriminalization would justify that inequality.
436580	439560	If it's a fair exchange where is the inequality?
439560	443520	Is there inequality because the woman needs money and the man has it and they're willing
443520	445520	to exchange sex for money?
445520	448280	Should she just get the money without having sex with him?
448280	449880	Is that where you're going to go with this?
449880	455040	Under cross-examination Smiley was asked several times about a line in her art piece in which
455040	461400	she characterizes those who see prostitution as sex work as racist white men who don't
461400	463840	care if indigenous women die.
463840	469900	Now I see prostitution as sex work, I want to see it legalized, and I do care if indigenous
469900	470900	women die.
470900	475520	In fact if there are a lot of indigenous prostitutes I think probably the best thing to do for
475520	480880	them is to get them into some kind of government regulated brothel instead of actually walking
480880	484400	the streets where they can be picked up by anybody and then dumped off in a ditch when
484400	485720	the guy's done with them.
485720	489380	It's true that there are women who advocate for prostitution as sex work who are women
489380	493180	but that there are also men and most of the buyers are men and they have a vested interest
493180	495120	to see it as work, Smiley said.
495120	499660	My vested interest to see it as work is not based on me fucking them because I have never
499660	503840	once actually been with a prostitute but it's because I don't want to see indigenous women
503840	508840	murdered and dumped off in the forest somewhere and ultimately that is what you are advocating
508840	509840	for here.
509840	514640	Smiley said she rejects the idea that decriminalization of prostitution or allowing women to work
514640	519920	in escort agencies for example is a form of harm reduction because in her view the very
519920	524460	act of prostitution is so harmful that the harm cannot be reduced.
524460	526660	And this is where the ideology is, alright?
526660	529700	This is where the radical feminist ideology comes into this.
529700	534120	Because it's not about individual women choosing to be prostitutes in a safe environment, it's
534120	538600	about the fabric of femininity or some other bullshit that she's going to pull out.
538600	541820	It's not about women's own choices, it's about her power structure.
541820	547040	Two defense witnesses testified earlier that the laws push the sex trade further underground
547040	549480	and put sex workers at a greater risk of harm.
549480	550480	Exactly.
550480	554140	But let's get away from violence committed against women and talk about violence committed
554140	555400	by women.
555400	560600	Women who killed husbands rarely gave a warning and most weren't abused, study finds.
560600	565500	The majority of the slayings, perpetuated by knife, gun and strangulation, appear generally
565500	569200	unheralded suggests the analysis of 20 years of Quebec homicide files.
569200	571880	Jesus, this is a terribly put together article.
571880	575860	Conventional wisdom suggests that women usually kill their spouses in self-defense or as a
575860	580540	final desperate reaction to chronic battery, the burning bed syndrome that is sometimes
580540	583420	cited as a defense in murder trials.
583420	588500	A new Canadian study, however, suggests that barely a quarter of husband killers are victims
588500	593980	of domestic abuse, less than half suffer from any identified psychological problem and fewer
593980	596100	still have had trouble with the police.
596100	597680	Well that's interesting, isn't it?
597680	603420	It's almost like the reasons that women kill people are just as wide and varied as men.
603420	607220	Women rarely give a warning before killing their mates, concluded the study, co-authored
607220	612380	by Dr. Dominique Bourget, a forensic psychiatrist at the Royal Ottawa Medical Health Centre.
612380	616620	In the vast majority of cases of women who killed their mates, there were very few indicators
616620	620840	that might have signaled the risk and helped predict the violent lethal behavior.
620840	627100	Although 35% of the male victims had a history of at least one act of past violence, the
627100	631820	researchers say they found evidence that just 26% of the women had been physically abused
631820	633420	by their partners.
633420	638180	That differs markedly from the findings of a 1989 American study that indicated almost
638180	642840	all women who committed spousal homicides did so in an environment of domestic abuse.
642840	646240	And a Canadian paper from the same period that attributed the motives for most such
646240	648560	killings to self-defense, notes the study.
648560	653540	To Don Dutton, a UBC psychology professor who has examined domestic violence for decades,
653540	657540	the results of the new study are no surprise, despite what he called an erroneous understanding
657540	660940	of intimate partner assault that continues to prevail in society.
660940	665260	We've got a stereotype about domestic violence, that the oppressor or perpetrator is the male,
665260	668500	and when female violence happens, it's a reaction against male violence.
668500	672520	The stereotype is so strong that when you look at the actual data, you're shocked.
672520	677520	Professor Dutton, author of the book Rethinking Domestic Violence, suggested that such assumptions
677520	682900	evolved from the feminist view that family violence was a sociopolitical act of patriarchal
682900	684820	men suppressing women.
684820	690980	He argues instead that personality disorders in both male and female offenders better explain
690980	693660	family violence than do social norms.
693660	697780	Maybe, maybe in reality not everything is about the patriarchy.
697780	703900	Maybe mental health issues are cross-gender and are far more important than bullshit ideologies.
703900	708780	Maybe it just turns out that women aren't these eternally pure beings always destined
708780	713980	to be the victim, but are human, just like men, and have all the same human downfalls
713980	714980	that men do.
714980	717300	Of course, saying that would be sexist.
717300	722460	And speaking of sexism, Trudeau government tells public service to end use of words like
722460	728860	mother, father, mister, missus, and forcing a switch to gender neutral language.
728860	732060	I mean, at least they're not making up pronouns, right?
732060	737020	In a change nobody asked for, the Trudeau government plans to ban frontline public service
737020	741340	workers from saying mister, missus, mother, and father.
741340	745580	That's according to a report by Radio Canada who gained access to government documents
745580	747220	stipulating the change.
747220	749300	Here are the key parts of that report.
749300	754040	According to documents obtained by Radio Canada, the French language arm of CBC, frontline
754040	759340	staff must now use gender neutral language or gender inclusive language.
759340	762740	This avoids portraying a perceived bias towards a particular sex or gender.
762740	765920	Says a copy of speaking notes prepared for managers and team leaders.
765920	771220	It is important that Service Canada as an organization reflects Canada's diverse population.
771220	774860	It ensures that the views and interests of Canadians are taken into account when we develop
774860	778280	policies, programs, services, and initiatives.
778280	782660	The new guidelines also rule out using terms such as mother and father because they are
782660	787340	gender specific and instead says the neutral term of parent should be used instead.
787340	793460	The same goes for honorifics such as mister, missus, and miss and in both languages.
793460	797060	Instead employees are being directed to address customers by their full names or ask them
797060	798580	what they want to be called.
798580	803500	After the official opposition raised serious questions about the proposal, Social Development
803500	808700	Minister, I can't fucking pronounce French names guys, clarified the measures in what
808700	811460	amounted to a desperate attempt to backtrack.
811460	815940	And here's some tweets here, let's be clear, Service Canada will continue to use mister
815940	818760	and miss when interacting with Canadians.
818760	822480	We are only confirming how people want to be addressed as a matter of respect.
822480	826320	We are proud that Service Canada reflects the diversity of Canada's population and is
826320	829220	working to adapt to the reality of 21st century families.
829220	832520	The way he presents it here is not really that big of a deal, right?
832520	835880	Like if you walk into Service Canada and you need something done and the person behind
835880	842160	the desk says, should I call you mister or missus or are you a mother or a father, it's
842160	843480	not really that big of a deal, is it?
843480	847660	That just seems a bit more like that overarching Canadian politeness that we've all come to
847660	848660	know and love.
848660	850360	But that's not quite what it is, is it?
850360	853320	That's not what the government document says according to the report.
853320	857300	Others are being told that they must use gender neutral language, not that they have
857300	859120	the choice of whether to use it.
859120	863360	The report notes that the document specifically rules out the use of terms like mother and
863360	864360	father.
864360	868680	This has been a usual tactic of the Trudeau government, who introduce some unpopular change
868680	872760	and then try to distract from what the change really is with some spin, while not actually
872760	874800	altering what they're doing behind the scenes.
874800	877480	In fact, reports already contradict this.
877480	880860	According to an official, who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized
880860	885060	to speak on the issue, the new directive is already in place and has led to some difficult
885060	886700	situations for civil servants.
886700	891820	It happens that when we talk to people and we ask, what is the name of parent number
891820	892820	one?
892820	894340	People do not understand, said the official.
894340	895980	Now that's the real problem, isn't it?
895980	900900	Because if you have two parents and you can't differentiate them by something like gender,
900900	905980	you have to place them in a numbered order, you have to go parent one and parent two or
905980	909760	parent three or four if there are some real fucking degenerates out there.
909760	916040	But the point is, in trying to avoid a gendered hierarchy of male and female, they are specifically
916040	920000	making a new hierarchy that is simply numbered.
920000	924840	So if the father is parent number one and the mother is parent number two, in my opinion,
924840	927900	that's a far stricter hierarchy than the man woman.
927900	932680	And really this is part of the larger problem of changing language to try and deny reality.
932680	936880	Like there are new stories coming out of schools banning the concept of best friends.
936880	941560	So if you have one friend that you're really close to, like Dave and I, if Dave and I were
941560	944360	best friends, we've been best friends since we were five years old, but that would be
944360	945360	banned now.
945360	946840	It's like, no, you can't be best friends with them.
946840	950040	You have to equally play with everybody else in the playground now while you're at school.
950040	953440	I mean, are they going to project that into the private life too?
953440	957160	Say that kids can't hang out with each other disproportionately more than other kids when
957160	958320	school's out?
958320	962900	Let's end on Lindsay Shepherd and the Faith Goldie talk at Laurier University.
962900	966460	Here's a tweet by Adida Choudhury, I guess.
966460	970380	I'm really proud and relieved that not only did you show Faith Goldie that her presence
970380	975340	is unwelcome at Laurier, you did so with grace and peacefully and nobody was hurt.
975340	980000	I want to hear more about all of you who made no Nazis at Laurier possible.
980000	985700	What happened here was that Faith Goldie, who is a right wing, white identitarian, was
985700	989360	set up by Lindsay Shepherd to give a talk at Wilfrid Laurier University.
989360	991660	I said this in How Cook Does Canada Part 3.
991660	996920	I don't agree with anything that Faith Goldie says, but I wouldn't kick her off a campus.
996920	1002000	It's more important to hear her ideas and debate them, even if just in your own head,
1002000	1003120	than it is to censor her.
1003120	1007000	But this person here is proud that somebody pulled the fire alarm or had the talk cancelled,
1007000	1008800	and Lindsay Shepherd had this to say about him.
1008800	1014000	It is not peaceful or graceful to pull a fire alarm to shut down a speaker's talk.
1014000	1017840	This kind of mindset is absolutely deranged and pathological.
1017840	1022280	People who derive pleasure from censoring others are sick and sad individuals.
1022280	1023860	And really, I have to agree.
1023860	1028140	The people who pulled the fire alarm and the people who support the fire alarm being pulled
1028140	1032860	on Faith Goldie, what did they actually accomplish?
1032860	1035220	Did they refute any of her ideas?
1035220	1038040	Well, no, they didn't.
1038040	1040460	Did they directly confront her?
1040460	1042060	No.
1042060	1044740	Did they present their own arguments?
1044740	1046180	Absolutely not.
1046180	1050760	This turns Faith Goldie into a martyr, which is absolutely something that we don't want.
1050760	1053580	We want to be able to debate people like Faith Goldie.
1053580	1058240	We want rationally-minded liberals to be in the audience and in the questioning lineup
1058240	1062200	for Faith Goldie's talks, and put to her the hard questions.
1062200	1064680	The questions that Faith Goldie can't answer.
1064680	1069560	The questions that, if asked, might actually leave Faith Goldie with egg on her face.
1069560	1073400	But when you get her event cancelled, the only thing that you're proving is that you're
1073400	1074400	afraid of her.
1074540	1079260	You're not strong, you're not graceful, you're not peaceful, and you're certainly not brave.
1079260	1080720	You're just being cowards.
1080720	1085300	I'll have more to say on the Lindsay Shepherd topic in the coming weeks.
1085300	1090020	I'm still working on How Cucked is Canada For, which is all about Jordan Peterson.
1090020	1094220	You're not going to see that next week, but you will probably see it the week after, because
1094220	1096540	there is quite a lot to go through.
1096540	1097980	But that about does it for this week.
1097980	1099380	Happy Canada Day, everybody!

1106280	1111380	And if you also like video games, I stream a variety of fun stuff five evenings a week
1111380	1113440	over on my Twitch channel as well.
1113440	1115260	So drop by and say hi sometime.
1115260	1116260	I hope to see you there.
1116260	1116760	I love you.
