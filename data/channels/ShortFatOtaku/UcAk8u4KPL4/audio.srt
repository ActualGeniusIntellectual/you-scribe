00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Alright chums, I've got about an hour between now and the Skaven RP, I'm currently recording

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,560
this on Sunday, and I'm not going to be around for the next few days, so I gotta get something

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,280
pre-recorded for Wednesday's video, and I've only got an hour to do it, so I figured we

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:26,700
would look at something that I've been putting off, but here we are, called r slash female

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,380
dating strategy.

6
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:34,980
I first learned of this because of low ping's twitter account, where he posted this story

7
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,020
from r slash female dating strategy.

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:44,500
Got set up with a LVM, got set up with, I think LVM means low value male, got set up

9
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,700
with a low value male and was almost assaulted.

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,860
Not too long ago I posted about a guy I met through friends, he seemed perfect, nice guy,

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,420
money, hot, tall, etc.

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,740
However my friends confessed, he's a virgin.

13
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,700
First red flag, but I ignored it.

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,540
So we go on a few dates and he's perfect, kind, pays for it and clearly made an effort.

15
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,420
So fast forward to a few dates later.

16
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,420
I invite him in and start making out and getting pretty frisky, loving it so far, but then

17
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,900
I grab his you know what and it's TINY.

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,060
Suddenly his virginity makes sense.

19
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,600
We're still kissing at this point but I just wanted to get out of there now.

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,260
I told him to stop and he apologized and got up off the couch.

21
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,020
If I had kept kissing him I'm really worried he'd have kept going and put me through an

22
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,500
awful experience.

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,780
Luckily nothing happened but I'm still pretty shook up about it.

24
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,620
I'm going to tell my friends about it tonight so they don't have to put someone else through

25
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,620
this.

26
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,620
I guess the search continues.

27
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:41,120
Okay so miss size queen here considers a low value male to be somebody with a tiny dick

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,380
even though he mentions that he's a nice guy, he has money, he's hot, he's tall, but he's

29
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,080
low value because the penis is small, that's pretty rough.

30
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,840
But re-look at the title.

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,680
Got set up with an LVM and was almost assaulted.

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,640
Are you fucking kidding me?

33
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,120
You were leaning into him the whole time.

34
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,720
Up until you discovered his dick size.

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,800
You were almost assaulted?

36
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,560
We're what a minute into the video and my mind's already blown by this.

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,640
So after reading this post I had to go and see just what the fuck female dating strategy

38
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
was.

39
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
And here it is.

40
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,580
The Female Dating Strategy dot com.

41
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,040
What is female dating strategy aka FDS?

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,280
We are a collective of women from all walks of life committed to developing, creating,

43
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,640
and implementing strategies, take control of our lives and narratives, and live a life

44
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,040
of true empowerment.

45
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,640
What is the goal of FDS?

46
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,000
FDS's goal is to deconstruct toxic and self-sabotaging cultural narratives that inhibit women from

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,760
living their best lives and entering into relationships that truly benefit them.

48
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,380
We believe in promoting self-advocacy, discarding victim narratives, and serving ourselves and

49
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,640
our future children.

50
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,440
What is your methodology?

51
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,480
Well maximum female benefit.

52
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,460
We seek to locate and define current cultural problems in dating and relationships and create

53
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:00,480
concrete actionable strategies to maximize our happiness and health while minimizing

54
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,520
overall risk.

55
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,180
We believe the collective mind is stronger than the individual and that dating strategy

56
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,760
is best gleaned from the real experiences of women around the world.

57
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,800
We center our methods in brutal realism about men and our current cultural climate not aspirational

58
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,480
but often practical ideology.

59
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,360
Each of our recommended strategies is weighed by overall risk versus reward based on real

60
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,920
world lived experience and available data to recommend the best course of action.

61
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,360
There's six core principles.

62
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
1.

63
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
Be a high-value woman.

64
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,280
A high-value woman is a woman who doesn't revolve her life around men.

65
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,120
She has her own career, hobbies, and a great social life that fulfills her emotional needs.

66
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,320
So if she does welcome a man into her life, he better be amazing.

67
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,960
A high-value woman also doesn't romanticize men's true nature, therefore she's cautious

68
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,480
around them and wants them to prove themselves to her before she gets emotionally attached.

69
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,480
2.

70
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,480
Let men chase you.

71
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,880
A man's role is to be the pursuer, the one to convince you that he's the right man

72
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
for you.

73
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,260
As a woman, you don't have to prove yourself to him.

74
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,760
He either sees your value or he doesn't.

75
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,560
The only thing that's within your control is working on becoming your best self.

76
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560
3.

77
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,880
Most men are not of value to you.

78
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,320
The majority of the advances you receive from men are not of any value because the majority

79
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,080
of them are from men who only want to use you for sex.

80
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,320
Many men are sex-driven, low-effort, and entitled.

81
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,240
However, there are also men out there who can be amazing boyfriends and husbands who

82
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,240
know how to be a man and how to take care of you in all ways.

83
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
4.

84
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,440
We evaluate men.

85
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,640
We do ourselves in humanity no favors allowing men to exhibit subpar behavior and being rewarded

86
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
with our attention.

87
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,400
Thus, be ruthless in cutting off men who add no value to your life.

88
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
5.

89
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,880
Make him invest before sex.

90
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,840
Don't have sex before commitment has been established or before he has demonstrated

91
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,840
value in investment.

92
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,680
If a man is really into you and sees you as a girlfriend material, he will commit to you

93
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,840
in two months.

94
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,900
If you're looking to have a dependable friends with benefits, you must still require investment

95
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,480
from him so he provides you with the respect and fun times that you want.

96
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
6.

97
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,000
We believe men are non-negotiable.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,920
We believe having your own career and making your own money, a man still has to add financial

99
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,300
value to your life and make you feel like he can take care of you.

100
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,680
This means not splitting the bill and not dating financially challenged men.

101
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:09,340
So what's interesting about this whole thing is that it feels like the female mirror image

102
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:15,420
men are not capable of genuine love.

103
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,380
In order to love a woman, they have to see her as human.

104
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,180
That's why most of them would rather keep the privilege of seeing you as an object,

105
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,900
to feel less bad about the mistreatment they put you through.

106
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,860
Hence the porn, aside from the inherent taut misogyny.

107
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,660
It is yet another tool to help them stay unattached, to feed their viewer view as an inanimate

108
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,340
object that should only serve them, an object that deserves to be punished if it is faulty

109
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,920
or dares to disobey, an object that deserves to be used then discarded.

110
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,720
They know they hate women and they are content with it.

111
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,760
So there are certainly some men out there like this.

112
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,680
But this honestly feels like projection.

113
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,440
Like if you go back to those six principles of female dating strategy, like this is the

114
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,880
inverse thing.

115
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,540
Like talking about how men have to prove themselves or men have to have certain kinds of value

116
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:59,080
or men have to chase you or what like it's this is the inverse situation.

117
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,320
They are complaining about what men do to them, which sometimes happens.

118
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,400
But then they're saying that they should do the same thing back to men.

119
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,280
This one's tagged scroats mad.

120
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Scroats.

121
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,460
All right.

122
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,840
This was posted in a subreddit, which I can't name as I did not break FDS rules, where users

123
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,320
share cringe content.

124
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,000
I fail to see what's cringe about a woman having standards.

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,080
This is why males on Reddit are single.

126
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,520
I do not accept a coffee or a walk as a possible date option.

127
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:34,560
McDonald's it is, but there are times for romantic, reasonably expensive dates.

128
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,560
It's not first date with a new girl who's all made up like this and clearly hunting

129
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
for a boyfriend.

130
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,480
If you're going for a coffee in the afternoon and you start sipping on coffee and talking

131
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,420
to them and it turns out, you know what, maybe she just doesn't like you or you just don't

132
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,420
like her.

133
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,240
You can easily just say thank you for your time and peace out.

134
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
You're not obligated.

135
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,440
You're not stuck at a restaurant, you know, half an hour from home where you need a ride

136
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,620
to get home.

137
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,960
That is the point of the first date being a little bit low effort.

138
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,920
It's not just because you're cheap.

139
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,600
It's not just because you might not want to invest in somebody right out the gate.

140
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,160
Again, that's actually a pretty good reason why, but it's also because you want there

141
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,960
to be an easy out.

142
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,040
Everyone is so offended that women have standards LMAO and then they shame us and call us sluts

143
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,280
if we have no standards.

144
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,160
This woman isn't obviously isn't going to sleep with just any dude.

145
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,920
She's vetting for a high value male, but nope, that makes her a bitch apparently.

146
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,320
When I see this much makeup, I don't think of somebody who's a high value woman.

147
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,200
I think of somebody who's kind of insecure to be honest, like makeup can look good.

148
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,840
I like when Naomi wears makeup sometimes, but like I wouldn't date somebody who's this

149
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,000
high maintenance.

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,360
I want somebody that I can go on adventures with and this does not seem like an adventurous

151
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
person.

152
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,840
This seems like a carry me around person.

153
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,600
I want a partner, not a doll that I have to like perfectly take care of.

154
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,900
I just wanted to share something that happened and I hope you guys think it's great as I

155
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,900
do lol.

156
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,460
My son and I have been working our way through the Star Wars canon and we're on season three

157
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,560
of Clone Wars.

158
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,680
For those not familiar, there's a very powerful female Sith named Ventress because she's getting

159
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,440
too powerful as the male Sith Palpatine puts it.

160
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
She must be killed.

161
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,240
My son pauses the show, looks at me and goes, how misogynistic.

162
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,280
He only wants to get rid of the powerful females.

163
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,480
Yep, they sure do.

164
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,760
When given a chance to replace her, it's mentioned that maybe a male should be sent.

165
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,560
I was so proud of him to recognize that.

166
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,320
So I've heard some people say that female dating strategy is a right leaning sub.

167
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,880
You know, it's just trad women who are demanding trad men, you know, step up and, but actually

168
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,360
no, that's not how it is at all.

169
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,920
Trad women do not care in this way about misogyny.

170
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,180
Probably not about representation in fucking media.

171
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,400
This is simply the most toxic parts of leftist feminism laid bare.

172
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,280
Never date a guy who studied philosophy.

173
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,520
Last night I went on a Tinder date and for the first time since I ended an LTR that had

174
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520
become abusive.

175
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,960
Tinder guy seemed intelligent, attractive, employed, all the usual things I look for

176
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
in a partner.

177
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
I met at the bar and ordered drinks.

178
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,000
As the conversation developed, I could sense he had a really strange attitude.

179
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,600
It was a combination of an unearned sense of superiority, unnecessary oppositional behavior,

180
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,160
and inexplicable misdirected hostility, all poorly concealed under a thinned veil of

181
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,720
self-serving liberalism.

182
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,880
My spidey senses were tingling, so I asked, hey, just curious, what was your major in

183
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,880
university?

184
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
But I already knew the answer.

185
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
Philosophy.

186
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,680
He said proudly, you know, maybe there's something to this one.

187
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
Oh cool.

188
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
I said, rolling my eyes.

189
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,800
In my experience, men who study philosophy are just the worst people.

190
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,860
Women who study philosophy are fine because they just want to read and learn and have

191
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,860
cool discussions.

192
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,640
Whereas men who study philosophy seek to dominate, they are so convinced of their own genius

193
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,320
that they constantly interrupt or talk over me.

194
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,640
They will go on and on mansplaining a basic concept I'm already familiar with.

195
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
They're boring.

196
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,040
There's, there's definitely something to be said about nerdy philosophy majors.

197
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
I understood.

198
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,040
All right.

199
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,320
People who like get a bit too over educated, they're too up their own ass.

200
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
Like I get it.

201
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
I get it.

202
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
Okay.

203
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,480
But this idea that women can't also have that sense of superiority is ridiculous.

204
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,040
All men are predators and misogynists until proven otherwise.

205
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,320
Jesus Christ.

206
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,040
This is going to be a hard pill to swallow.

207
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,820
The majority of men don't value women as people, and I mean the vast majority of men.

208
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,560
Even the men who are in our daily lives that we cherish, I have come to accept that all

209
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,840
men are trash until proven otherwise.

210
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,940
I have found that keeping all men in all situations at arm's length until I have substantial

211
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,080
proof of their character to be very beneficial.

212
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,240
This goes for family too.

213
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,000
I have many male family members that I keep a need to know business style relationship

214
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
with.

215
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,280
How a man treats any woman in his life is indicative of how he views women period.

216
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,880
Your male friend likely keeps you around for hopes of sex and then dogs you behind

217
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
your back.

218
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,160
Your friends with benefits, shared your nudes to his group chat and mocks your body.

219
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,720
Most of your boyfriends do this too.

220
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,640
The father of the picturesque new killer family.

221
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
You know what?

222
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,880
This is, this is insane.

223
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,720
If you said this, if you just changed out man with black and woman with white, these

224
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,400
people would be called the most racist of the fucking racists out there.

225
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,720
Men are slaves to their dicks and they will try to make you a slave to their dicks too.

226
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,280
Um, there's actually a lot of women who are into that.

227
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
It never fucking ends.

228
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,120
Go to the dead bedroom sub and there are endless variations of I want sex every day, but she

229
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
doesn't.

230
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
My wife had a baby a few months ago.

231
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
What about my dick?

232
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,960
I want to insert disgusting, degrading porn inspired sex act and she won't.

233
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,040
Should I suggest ethical non-monogamy or my primary love language is fucking.

234
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,660
I can't feel connection either way.

235
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,360
Then when his bullshit needs aren't being met, needs, he goes to porn or cam girls or

236
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,080
affairs all of which introduces instability into the family.

237
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,400
All because of his dick.

238
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Never once does he think that just maybe his dick shouldn't be in control.

239
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,460
Men throw away so much following their dicks, families, self-respect and careers.

240
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,680
This is why men are unfit to lead anything.

241
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,960
Women only suffer reproductive madness once a month.

242
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,640
For men it's a daily existence.

243
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,740
Again, look at the hypocrisy.

244
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,480
Look back at them talking about their needs and how they deserve to have to live their

245
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,240
most full life and all this other fucking nonsense.

246
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,120
But there's no actual care for their partners.

247
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,760
They don't care about these men.

248
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,620
They only care about what can be provided to them.

249
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,000
And they say, yes, of course, I mean, we're women.

250
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,400
We shouldn't be this way.

251
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
It's like soulless.

252
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,040
I'm not saying that the guys who do some of this terrible shit are any better.

253
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
They're not.

254
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,500
But they have basically taken the worst of the male sex, ignored the best of it, taken

255
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,780
only the worst, stooped down to their level and then justified it while demanding that

256
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,940
men themselves change.

257
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,420
It's insanity, dude.

258
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,140
Why men must give in relationships.

259
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,260
If a man doesn't splurge on you, he doesn't care enough.

260
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,260
When a man finds a woman he really values, he will spend every last penny trying to win

261
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,260
her over.

262
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,780
How many times have you heard of men barely paying for their wife and kids while buying

263
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,780
expensive gifts for their mistresses?

264
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,660
Men like to spend money on women.

265
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,680
There's whole fetish communities around this.

266
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,680
Only if a man feels you aren't a good investment will he be reluctant to spend on you.

267
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,100
Income isn't a factor either.

268
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,080
Even poor men will spend on women.

269
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,700
Don't be caught up with a cheap guy, nor a guy who thinks that money is everything.

270
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,100
It's a minimum requirement, really.

271
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,580
I used to think money didn't matter, but it ain't true.

272
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,460
Gold diggers not even once.

273
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:55,020
Dear male lurkers, FDS is coming for your girlfriends.

274
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,660
I just want to take a moment to validate all those paranoid thoughts buried deep in your

275
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,300
subconscious that your girlfriend is going to find FDS and dump you for being low value.

276
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,540
Or maybe you're single and you already struggle to get women's attention and deep down you'll

277
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,940
know you'll never find a girlfriend if women raise their standards.

278
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,740
Perhaps you're a wannabe player and browsing this sub makes you rage at the thought of

279
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,700
women expecting more from men and no longer being so easily fooled into casual sex.

280
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,700
It's all true.

281
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,700
Yep, all of it.

282
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,700
It's going to happen.

283
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Only a matter of time.

284
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,500
You know, I'm happy I'm with Naomi.

285
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
She's not like this at all.

286
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,860
This is not her personality.

287
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,780
Not all women view relationships in such a calculating way and in fact they find it just

288
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:37,420
as disgusting to do so as, for example, you and I do, assuming that you agree with me

289
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,420
on this.

290
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,420
I assume you do.

291
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,420
That's why you're here this far, right?

292
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,580
This is ultimately a negative end result to women who behave this way and think like

293
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,580
this.

294
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,820
Like, I have to assume that just like a lot of the pickup artist guys, a lot of these

295
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,340
girls they're like, they probably went through some pretty bad experiences and this is just

296
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:59,140
like a trauma response because Jesus Christ, to be this toxic, to be this terrible towards

297
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,140
other people.

298
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,140
It ain't normal.

299
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,140
You know what I mean?

300
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:06,780
My mission in life is make my husband's life as easy, happy, fun and profitable as possible.

301
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,440
Every action I take is to be an asset to him, not a liability.

302
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,840
Would a modern woman consider me more noble than if I did that for a company instead?

303
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
Depends.

304
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,680
Is your husband cutting you a check every week?

305
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
How does your prenup look?

306
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,280
Are you prepared to survive without him if he dies or decides his 24 year old secretary

307
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,680
would actually make him happier?

308
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,280
Are your wiping skills transferred to an equally supportive position within someone else?

309
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,200
Burying your head in the sand about the risk you're taking as a trad wife because you hate

310
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,080
feeling like you can't compete with modern women is not a great strategy, sis.

311
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
This is like a third position.

312
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,080
Yeah, okay.

313
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,800
So you know third positionism in politics?

314
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,760
This is like third positionism for like the sexual marketplace because you have the modern

315
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,060
woman who does the working for a company, doesn't want to have kids, you know, some

316
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,120
guys don't care, some guys want a more trad wife, you know, whatever, whatever, whatever

317
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
you want.

318
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,040
There's the modern woman, there's the trad wife, and then there's like the female dating

319
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,880
strategy poster who like has none of the positives of either of those two options.

320
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,180
This person is looking at sex and romance like it's merely transactional, which is honestly

321
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,740
the problem with a lot of the modern dating scene, but at the same time, they're demanding

322
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:12,380
a very rigid, very conservative view of what a man should be in the high value male thing.

323
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,740
So they are literally the worst of both worlds.

324
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,940
The men's rights movement is growing and it's terrifying.

325
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,740
I have a feeling that the more people who see female dating strategy, the more people

326
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,760
will join them.

327
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,860
You are causing this problem.

328
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,380
I had a rather sad conversation with my cousin and a family friend the other day.

329
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,540
They were arguing that men have it so hard and at times, even more difficult than women.

330
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,980
Their arguments were this, one, men have an unattainable standard of beauty, two, men

331
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,300
have a harder time getting dates, three, men face so much pressure trying to get good

332
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,060
jobs and be a provider, four, women tell men to open up emotions, but when men do, women

333
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,060
are disgusted, five, women have more social support than men.

334
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,060
Here's the thing.

335
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,300
This is all like pretty true sometimes, at least not all the time, but sometimes definitely.

336
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,460
And not only is it true, these are things that like a female dating strategist would

337
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,100
like Chad yes to it's like, yes, all five of those points, I expect you'd be able to

338
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,100
do them all, all the time.

339
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:06,460
And it's like, well, why would men lift this kind of a burden if they get absolutely nothing

340
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,460
from it?

341
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,580
Of course, there is always hope.

342
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,940
Really hoping that this is a joke, the audacity of scrotes.

343
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,580
I'm a moderator of female dating strategy on Reddit and I've been masquerading as a

344
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:21,420
woman to feed them bad advice on how to get men so these toxic bitches never send a chance

345
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,540
and exploiting a male for his baby and money.

346
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:28,820
Sorry, but not sorry, it had to be done, dude.

347
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,220
Take one for the team.

348
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,740
The other side of female dating strategy is something kind of like women posting their

349
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:40,220
L's and what you see over here, there's a lot of sad, depressing romance stories from

350
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,300
the woman's perspective.

351
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:46,380
And this just seems to be the natural end result of the female dating strategy.

352
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,700
It's women who have their standards way too high based on what they themselves bring to

353
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,820
the table, which sometimes isn't that much.

354
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,460
And then experiencing all the bad ends that comes with that.

355
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,340
This is from a person who has an OnlyFans.

356
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,700
I mean, I guess you must know your value, you're getting it right there since you're

357
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,700
literally selling it.

358
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,180
But she says, I tried going on a date last night to feel a bit more normal and social.

359
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,620
This man loved me up until I told him I do OnlyFans, then he left and didn't even pay

360
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,620
for our drinks.

361
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,900
I wasted $60 and was left crying in the middle of a bar by some prick with a receding hairline.

362
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,740
The fact that you think that it's his fault and not yours to the point that you're mad

363
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,040
at him and you're going to insult him over something he can't control, which is his receding

364
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,420
hairline, kind of shows that he's probably right about you.

365
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,540
The idea of being married is so weird.

366
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,920
Like what if I'm having a sad moment late at night and I want to cry in bed and there's

367
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,320
just some guy there.

368
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:37,300
The fact that you would view your husband as just some guy and not the emotional rock,

369
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,780
the partner that you're moving through life with who would help you during your sad moments,

370
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,860
again, kind of speaks to your toxic, corrupted mindset.

371
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,660
Been dating a married guy for six months now.

372
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,740
He's loving, consistent, and he chose to wait for me for six months without having sex.

373
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,460
Two weeks back we made love and the next day he changed, stopped picking calls and

374
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,180
responding to my texts saying he's busy.

375
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,980
He made me fall in love and I'm now confused.

376
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,680
I mean, he's a piece of shit for cheating, but look what you're doing.

377
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,760
You were fucking around with this guy for six months knowing he was married.

378
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,020
What the fuck is wrong with you?

379
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,140
If I cheated on you, instead of leaving me, just understand the fact that you lack something

380
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,460
which the man I cheated on you with doesn't.

381
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,580
Find out the error in yourself, apologize to me, say sorry, accept it, and become a

382
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,580
better man.

383
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,680
You are actually just a piece of shit.

384
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,040
It's this assumption that woman equals good in all situations.

385
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,680
And so whatever that women do, then it's automatically validated because why not?

386
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
Girl power.

387
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,900
Yeah, this whole thing is just depressing.

388
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,660
It's a fundamental misunderstanding of what romance should be, in my opinion.

389
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:44,520
It's definitely a consequence of the modern day hookup culture and it's not just the fault

390
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,900
of women, but it's also the fault of men because like I said, there is a mere version of this

391
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,700
on the man's side of things.

392
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,260
A truly fulfilling relationship.

393
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,980
You don't keep score like this.

394
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,880
Now you both have to contribute.

395
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,020
It's not that you can just, oh, we're not keeping a score, so I'll just exploit the

396
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,020
fuck out of my partner.

397
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,020
No, you can't do that.

398
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:11,320
But the idea is you put everything you have into your relationship because you genuinely

399
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,040
care for the other person on both sides.

400
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:21,160
And if sometimes one of them kind of falls apart because life sucker punches you, sometimes

401
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
it happens.

402
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,520
You have a health problem, you lose your job out of nowhere, you get laid off, get into

403
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,760
an accident, whatever it is, there are things that are just not your fault that can happen

404
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,040
to you.

405
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,420
And now suddenly you're not the strong, stable provider.

406
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:44,360
Now suddenly you're not the cute, perky, happy young woman that he married.

407
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:51,080
Whatever it is, what keeps you going in those down times, it's not going to be sexual attraction.

408
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,880
It's not going to be any of this kind of ruthless calculus.

409
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,800
It's not going to be money, that can help depending on what you're talking about, but

410
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,060
ultimately it's not going to be money.

411
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,320
It's going to be your love for each other.

412
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,120
The reason that most cultures have this view of monogamy that includes something like,

413
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,540
though not always with the same words every time, but something like in sickness and in

414
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:18,500
health, rich or poor, stuff like that, is that you're making a commitment to each other,

415
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,060
but you're making a commitment to the metaphysical idea of each other, not just what you can

416
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,060
bring to the table.

417
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,660
That's important, that's not nothing, but it's also not all of it.

418
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,740
And I think that's what these people don't understand.

419
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,060
These genuinely seem like people who are not capable of love.

420
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,740
And honestly, like sometimes when I do a Reddit video on this channel, I'll laugh, I'll have

421
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,940
a good little giggle about it, it'll be like stupidity.

422
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,700
This just made me feel really fucking sad.
