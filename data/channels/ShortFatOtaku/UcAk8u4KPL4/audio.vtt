WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Alright chums, I've got about an hour between now and the Skaven RP, I'm currently recording

00:11.000 --> 00:15.560
this on Sunday, and I'm not going to be around for the next few days, so I gotta get something

00:15.560 --> 00:20.280
pre-recorded for Wednesday's video, and I've only got an hour to do it, so I figured we

00:20.280 --> 00:26.700
would look at something that I've been putting off, but here we are, called r slash female

00:26.700 --> 00:29.380
dating strategy.

00:29.380 --> 00:34.980
I first learned of this because of low ping's twitter account, where he posted this story

00:34.980 --> 00:37.020
from r slash female dating strategy.

00:37.020 --> 00:44.500
Got set up with a LVM, got set up with, I think LVM means low value male, got set up

00:44.500 --> 00:47.700
with a low value male and was almost assaulted.

00:47.700 --> 00:51.860
Not too long ago I posted about a guy I met through friends, he seemed perfect, nice guy,

00:51.860 --> 00:53.420
money, hot, tall, etc.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.740
However my friends confessed, he's a virgin.

00:55.740 --> 00:59.700
First red flag, but I ignored it.

00:59.700 --> 01:04.540
So we go on a few dates and he's perfect, kind, pays for it and clearly made an effort.

01:04.540 --> 01:06.420
So fast forward to a few dates later.

01:06.420 --> 01:10.420
I invite him in and start making out and getting pretty frisky, loving it so far, but then

01:10.420 --> 01:12.900
I grab his you know what and it's TINY.

01:12.900 --> 01:18.060
Suddenly his virginity makes sense.

01:18.060 --> 01:20.600
We're still kissing at this point but I just wanted to get out of there now.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.260
I told him to stop and he apologized and got up off the couch.

01:23.260 --> 01:27.020
If I had kept kissing him I'm really worried he'd have kept going and put me through an

01:27.020 --> 01:28.500
awful experience.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.780
Luckily nothing happened but I'm still pretty shook up about it.

01:30.780 --> 01:33.620
I'm going to tell my friends about it tonight so they don't have to put someone else through

01:33.620 --> 01:34.620
this.

01:34.620 --> 01:35.620
I guess the search continues.

01:35.620 --> 01:41.120
Okay so miss size queen here considers a low value male to be somebody with a tiny dick

01:41.120 --> 01:45.380
even though he mentions that he's a nice guy, he has money, he's hot, he's tall, but he's

01:45.380 --> 01:49.080
low value because the penis is small, that's pretty rough.

01:49.080 --> 01:50.840
But re-look at the title.

01:50.840 --> 01:54.680
Got set up with an LVM and was almost assaulted.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.640
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:56.640 --> 01:59.120
You were leaning into him the whole time.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.720
Up until you discovered his dick size.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.800
You were almost assaulted?

02:03.800 --> 02:07.560
We're what a minute into the video and my mind's already blown by this.

02:07.560 --> 02:11.640
So after reading this post I had to go and see just what the fuck female dating strategy

02:11.640 --> 02:12.640
was.

02:12.640 --> 02:13.640
And here it is.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.580
The Female Dating Strategy dot com.

02:15.580 --> 02:19.040
What is female dating strategy aka FDS?

02:19.040 --> 02:23.280
We are a collective of women from all walks of life committed to developing, creating,

02:23.280 --> 02:26.640
and implementing strategies, take control of our lives and narratives, and live a life

02:26.640 --> 02:28.040
of true empowerment.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.640
What is the goal of FDS?

02:29.640 --> 02:35.000
FDS's goal is to deconstruct toxic and self-sabotaging cultural narratives that inhibit women from

02:35.000 --> 02:38.760
living their best lives and entering into relationships that truly benefit them.

02:38.760 --> 02:43.380
We believe in promoting self-advocacy, discarding victim narratives, and serving ourselves and

02:43.380 --> 02:44.640
our future children.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.440
What is your methodology?

02:46.440 --> 02:50.480
Well maximum female benefit.

02:50.480 --> 02:55.460
We seek to locate and define current cultural problems in dating and relationships and create

02:55.460 --> 03:00.480
concrete actionable strategies to maximize our happiness and health while minimizing

03:00.480 --> 03:01.520
overall risk.

03:01.520 --> 03:05.180
We believe the collective mind is stronger than the individual and that dating strategy

03:05.180 --> 03:08.760
is best gleaned from the real experiences of women around the world.

03:08.760 --> 03:13.800
We center our methods in brutal realism about men and our current cultural climate not aspirational

03:13.800 --> 03:15.480
but often practical ideology.

03:15.520 --> 03:19.360
Each of our recommended strategies is weighed by overall risk versus reward based on real

03:19.360 --> 03:22.920
world lived experience and available data to recommend the best course of action.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.360
There's six core principles.

03:24.360 --> 03:25.360
1.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.360
Be a high-value woman.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.280
A high-value woman is a woman who doesn't revolve her life around men.

03:28.280 --> 03:31.120
She has her own career, hobbies, and a great social life that fulfills her emotional needs.

03:31.120 --> 03:34.320
So if she does welcome a man into her life, he better be amazing.

03:34.320 --> 03:37.960
A high-value woman also doesn't romanticize men's true nature, therefore she's cautious

03:37.960 --> 03:41.480
around them and wants them to prove themselves to her before she gets emotionally attached.

03:41.480 --> 03:42.480
2.

03:42.480 --> 03:43.480
Let men chase you.

03:43.480 --> 03:46.880
A man's role is to be the pursuer, the one to convince you that he's the right man

03:46.880 --> 03:47.880
for you.

03:47.880 --> 03:51.260
As a woman, you don't have to prove yourself to him.

03:51.260 --> 03:52.760
He either sees your value or he doesn't.

03:52.760 --> 03:55.560
The only thing that's within your control is working on becoming your best self.

03:55.560 --> 03:56.560
3.

03:56.560 --> 03:57.880
Most men are not of value to you.

03:57.880 --> 04:01.320
The majority of the advances you receive from men are not of any value because the majority

04:01.320 --> 04:04.080
of them are from men who only want to use you for sex.

04:04.080 --> 04:06.320
Many men are sex-driven, low-effort, and entitled.

04:06.320 --> 04:09.240
However, there are also men out there who can be amazing boyfriends and husbands who

04:09.240 --> 04:12.240
know how to be a man and how to take care of you in all ways.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.240
4.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.440
We evaluate men.

04:14.440 --> 04:19.640
We do ourselves in humanity no favors allowing men to exhibit subpar behavior and being rewarded

04:19.640 --> 04:20.640
with our attention.

04:20.640 --> 04:24.400
Thus, be ruthless in cutting off men who add no value to your life.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.400
5.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.880
Make him invest before sex.

04:26.880 --> 04:29.840
Don't have sex before commitment has been established or before he has demonstrated

04:29.840 --> 04:30.840
value in investment.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.680
If a man is really into you and sees you as a girlfriend material, he will commit to you

04:33.680 --> 04:34.840
in two months.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.900
If you're looking to have a dependable friends with benefits, you must still require investment

04:37.900 --> 04:41.480
from him so he provides you with the respect and fun times that you want.

04:41.480 --> 04:42.480
6.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.000
We believe men are non-negotiable.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.920
We believe having your own career and making your own money, a man still has to add financial

04:47.920 --> 04:50.300
value to your life and make you feel like he can take care of you.

04:50.300 --> 04:53.680
This means not splitting the bill and not dating financially challenged men.

04:53.680 --> 05:09.340
So what's interesting about this whole thing is that it feels like the female mirror image

06:09.340 --> 06:15.420
men are not capable of genuine love.

06:15.420 --> 06:17.380
In order to love a woman, they have to see her as human.

06:17.380 --> 06:20.180
That's why most of them would rather keep the privilege of seeing you as an object,

06:20.180 --> 06:22.900
to feel less bad about the mistreatment they put you through.

06:22.900 --> 06:25.860
Hence the porn, aside from the inherent taut misogyny.

06:25.860 --> 06:29.660
It is yet another tool to help them stay unattached, to feed their viewer view as an inanimate

06:29.660 --> 06:33.340
object that should only serve them, an object that deserves to be punished if it is faulty

06:33.340 --> 06:36.920
or dares to disobey, an object that deserves to be used then discarded.

06:36.920 --> 06:39.720
They know they hate women and they are content with it.

06:39.720 --> 06:41.760
So there are certainly some men out there like this.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.680
But this honestly feels like projection.

06:43.680 --> 06:48.440
Like if you go back to those six principles of female dating strategy, like this is the

06:48.440 --> 06:49.880
inverse thing.

06:49.880 --> 06:54.540
Like talking about how men have to prove themselves or men have to have certain kinds of value

06:54.540 --> 06:59.080
or men have to chase you or what like it's this is the inverse situation.

06:59.080 --> 07:03.320
They are complaining about what men do to them, which sometimes happens.

07:03.320 --> 07:06.400
But then they're saying that they should do the same thing back to men.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.280
This one's tagged scroats mad.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.280
Scroats.

07:10.280 --> 07:11.460
All right.

07:11.460 --> 07:15.840
This was posted in a subreddit, which I can't name as I did not break FDS rules, where users

07:15.840 --> 07:18.320
share cringe content.

07:18.320 --> 07:21.000
I fail to see what's cringe about a woman having standards.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.080
This is why males on Reddit are single.

07:23.080 --> 07:27.520
I do not accept a coffee or a walk as a possible date option.

07:27.520 --> 07:34.560
McDonald's it is, but there are times for romantic, reasonably expensive dates.

07:34.560 --> 07:38.560
It's not first date with a new girl who's all made up like this and clearly hunting

07:38.560 --> 07:39.560
for a boyfriend.

07:39.560 --> 07:43.480
If you're going for a coffee in the afternoon and you start sipping on coffee and talking

07:43.480 --> 07:46.420
to them and it turns out, you know what, maybe she just doesn't like you or you just don't

07:46.420 --> 07:47.420
like her.

07:47.420 --> 07:50.240
You can easily just say thank you for your time and peace out.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.240
You're not obligated.

07:51.240 --> 07:54.440
You're not stuck at a restaurant, you know, half an hour from home where you need a ride

07:54.440 --> 07:55.620
to get home.

07:55.620 --> 07:58.960
That is the point of the first date being a little bit low effort.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.920
It's not just because you're cheap.

08:00.920 --> 08:04.600
It's not just because you might not want to invest in somebody right out the gate.

08:04.600 --> 08:08.160
Again, that's actually a pretty good reason why, but it's also because you want there

08:08.160 --> 08:09.960
to be an easy out.

08:09.960 --> 08:14.040
Everyone is so offended that women have standards LMAO and then they shame us and call us sluts

08:14.040 --> 08:15.280
if we have no standards.

08:15.280 --> 08:18.160
This woman isn't obviously isn't going to sleep with just any dude.

08:18.160 --> 08:21.920
She's vetting for a high value male, but nope, that makes her a bitch apparently.

08:21.920 --> 08:26.320
When I see this much makeup, I don't think of somebody who's a high value woman.

08:26.320 --> 08:30.200
I think of somebody who's kind of insecure to be honest, like makeup can look good.

08:30.480 --> 08:34.840
I like when Naomi wears makeup sometimes, but like I wouldn't date somebody who's this

08:34.840 --> 08:36.000
high maintenance.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.360
I want somebody that I can go on adventures with and this does not seem like an adventurous

08:40.360 --> 08:41.360
person.

08:41.360 --> 08:42.840
This seems like a carry me around person.

08:42.840 --> 08:46.600
I want a partner, not a doll that I have to like perfectly take care of.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.900
I just wanted to share something that happened and I hope you guys think it's great as I

08:49.900 --> 08:50.900
do lol.

08:50.900 --> 08:54.460
My son and I have been working our way through the Star Wars canon and we're on season three

08:54.460 --> 08:55.560
of Clone Wars.

08:55.560 --> 08:59.680
For those not familiar, there's a very powerful female Sith named Ventress because she's getting

08:59.680 --> 09:02.440
too powerful as the male Sith Palpatine puts it.

09:02.440 --> 09:03.440
She must be killed.

09:03.440 --> 09:06.240
My son pauses the show, looks at me and goes, how misogynistic.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.280
He only wants to get rid of the powerful females.

09:08.280 --> 09:09.480
Yep, they sure do.

09:09.480 --> 09:12.760
When given a chance to replace her, it's mentioned that maybe a male should be sent.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.560
I was so proud of him to recognize that.

09:14.560 --> 09:19.320
So I've heard some people say that female dating strategy is a right leaning sub.

09:19.320 --> 09:23.880
You know, it's just trad women who are demanding trad men, you know, step up and, but actually

09:23.880 --> 09:25.360
no, that's not how it is at all.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.920
Trad women do not care in this way about misogyny.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.180
Probably not about representation in fucking media.

09:30.180 --> 09:35.400
This is simply the most toxic parts of leftist feminism laid bare.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.280
Never date a guy who studied philosophy.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.520
Last night I went on a Tinder date and for the first time since I ended an LTR that had

09:41.520 --> 09:42.520
become abusive.

09:42.520 --> 09:44.960
Tinder guy seemed intelligent, attractive, employed, all the usual things I look for

09:44.960 --> 09:45.960
in a partner.

09:45.960 --> 09:46.960
I met at the bar and ordered drinks.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.000
As the conversation developed, I could sense he had a really strange attitude.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.600
It was a combination of an unearned sense of superiority, unnecessary oppositional behavior,

09:53.600 --> 09:57.160
and inexplicable misdirected hostility, all poorly concealed under a thinned veil of

09:57.160 --> 09:58.720
self-serving liberalism.

09:58.720 --> 10:01.880
My spidey senses were tingling, so I asked, hey, just curious, what was your major in

10:01.880 --> 10:02.880
university?

10:02.880 --> 10:03.880
But I already knew the answer.

10:03.880 --> 10:04.880
Philosophy.

10:04.880 --> 10:09.680
He said proudly, you know, maybe there's something to this one.

10:09.680 --> 10:10.680
Oh cool.

10:10.680 --> 10:11.680
I said, rolling my eyes.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.800
In my experience, men who study philosophy are just the worst people.

10:14.800 --> 10:20.860
Women who study philosophy are fine because they just want to read and learn and have

10:20.860 --> 10:21.860
cool discussions.

10:21.860 --> 10:25.640
Whereas men who study philosophy seek to dominate, they are so convinced of their own genius

10:25.640 --> 10:27.320
that they constantly interrupt or talk over me.

10:27.320 --> 10:30.640
They will go on and on mansplaining a basic concept I'm already familiar with.

10:30.640 --> 10:31.640
They're boring.

10:31.640 --> 10:34.040
There's, there's definitely something to be said about nerdy philosophy majors.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.040
I understood.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.040
All right.

10:36.040 --> 10:39.320
People who like get a bit too over educated, they're too up their own ass.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.320
Like I get it.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.320
I get it.

10:41.320 --> 10:42.320
Okay.

10:42.320 --> 10:46.480
But this idea that women can't also have that sense of superiority is ridiculous.

10:46.480 --> 10:50.040
All men are predators and misogynists until proven otherwise.

10:50.040 --> 10:53.320
Jesus Christ.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.040
This is going to be a hard pill to swallow.

10:55.040 --> 10:59.820
The majority of men don't value women as people, and I mean the vast majority of men.

10:59.820 --> 11:03.560
Even the men who are in our daily lives that we cherish, I have come to accept that all

11:03.560 --> 11:05.840
men are trash until proven otherwise.

11:05.840 --> 11:09.940
I have found that keeping all men in all situations at arm's length until I have substantial

11:09.940 --> 11:12.080
proof of their character to be very beneficial.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.240
This goes for family too.

11:13.240 --> 11:17.000
I have many male family members that I keep a need to know business style relationship

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
with.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.280
How a man treats any woman in his life is indicative of how he views women period.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.880
Your male friend likely keeps you around for hopes of sex and then dogs you behind

11:24.880 --> 11:25.880
your back.

11:25.880 --> 11:29.160
Your friends with benefits, shared your nudes to his group chat and mocks your body.

11:29.160 --> 11:30.720
Most of your boyfriends do this too.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.640
The father of the picturesque new killer family.

11:32.640 --> 11:33.640
You know what?

11:33.640 --> 11:34.880
This is, this is insane.

11:34.880 --> 11:39.720
If you said this, if you just changed out man with black and woman with white, these

11:39.720 --> 11:44.400
people would be called the most racist of the fucking racists out there.

11:44.400 --> 11:49.720
Men are slaves to their dicks and they will try to make you a slave to their dicks too.

11:49.720 --> 11:53.280
Um, there's actually a lot of women who are into that.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.280
It never fucking ends.

11:54.280 --> 11:58.120
Go to the dead bedroom sub and there are endless variations of I want sex every day, but she

11:58.120 --> 11:59.120
doesn't.

11:59.120 --> 12:00.120
My wife had a baby a few months ago.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.120
What about my dick?

12:01.120 --> 12:04.960
I want to insert disgusting, degrading porn inspired sex act and she won't.

12:04.960 --> 12:09.040
Should I suggest ethical non-monogamy or my primary love language is fucking.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.660
I can't feel connection either way.

12:10.660 --> 12:15.360
Then when his bullshit needs aren't being met, needs, he goes to porn or cam girls or

12:15.360 --> 12:18.080
affairs all of which introduces instability into the family.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.400
All because of his dick.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.400
Never once does he think that just maybe his dick shouldn't be in control.

12:22.400 --> 12:26.460
Men throw away so much following their dicks, families, self-respect and careers.

12:26.460 --> 12:28.680
This is why men are unfit to lead anything.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.960
Women only suffer reproductive madness once a month.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.640
For men it's a daily existence.

12:32.640 --> 12:34.740
Again, look at the hypocrisy.

12:34.740 --> 12:38.480
Look back at them talking about their needs and how they deserve to have to live their

12:38.480 --> 12:41.240
most full life and all this other fucking nonsense.

12:41.240 --> 12:44.120
But there's no actual care for their partners.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.760
They don't care about these men.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.620
They only care about what can be provided to them.

12:48.620 --> 12:51.000
And they say, yes, of course, I mean, we're women.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.400
We shouldn't be this way.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.400
It's like soulless.

12:53.400 --> 12:58.040
I'm not saying that the guys who do some of this terrible shit are any better.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.040
They're not.

12:59.040 --> 13:04.500
But they have basically taken the worst of the male sex, ignored the best of it, taken

13:04.500 --> 13:10.780
only the worst, stooped down to their level and then justified it while demanding that

13:10.780 --> 13:12.940
men themselves change.

13:12.940 --> 13:14.420
It's insanity, dude.

13:14.420 --> 13:17.140
Why men must give in relationships.

13:17.140 --> 13:19.260
If a man doesn't splurge on you, he doesn't care enough.

13:19.260 --> 13:23.260
When a man finds a woman he really values, he will spend every last penny trying to win

13:23.260 --> 13:24.260
her over.

13:24.260 --> 13:27.780
How many times have you heard of men barely paying for their wife and kids while buying

13:27.780 --> 13:29.780
expensive gifts for their mistresses?

13:29.780 --> 13:31.660
Men like to spend money on women.

13:31.660 --> 13:33.680
There's whole fetish communities around this.

13:33.680 --> 13:37.680
Only if a man feels you aren't a good investment will he be reluctant to spend on you.

13:37.680 --> 13:39.100
Income isn't a factor either.

13:39.100 --> 13:41.080
Even poor men will spend on women.

13:41.080 --> 13:44.700
Don't be caught up with a cheap guy, nor a guy who thinks that money is everything.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.100
It's a minimum requirement, really.

13:46.140 --> 13:48.580
I used to think money didn't matter, but it ain't true.

13:48.580 --> 13:50.460
Gold diggers not even once.

13:50.460 --> 13:55.020
Dear male lurkers, FDS is coming for your girlfriends.

13:55.020 --> 13:58.660
I just want to take a moment to validate all those paranoid thoughts buried deep in your

13:58.660 --> 14:03.300
subconscious that your girlfriend is going to find FDS and dump you for being low value.

14:03.300 --> 14:06.540
Or maybe you're single and you already struggle to get women's attention and deep down you'll

14:06.540 --> 14:08.940
know you'll never find a girlfriend if women raise their standards.

14:08.940 --> 14:12.740
Perhaps you're a wannabe player and browsing this sub makes you rage at the thought of

14:12.740 --> 14:17.700
women expecting more from men and no longer being so easily fooled into casual sex.

14:17.700 --> 14:18.700
It's all true.

14:18.700 --> 14:19.700
Yep, all of it.

14:19.700 --> 14:20.700
It's going to happen.

14:20.700 --> 14:21.700
Only a matter of time.

14:21.700 --> 14:24.500
You know, I'm happy I'm with Naomi.

14:24.500 --> 14:25.500
She's not like this at all.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.860
This is not her personality.

14:26.860 --> 14:31.780
Not all women view relationships in such a calculating way and in fact they find it just

14:31.780 --> 14:37.420
as disgusting to do so as, for example, you and I do, assuming that you agree with me

14:37.420 --> 14:38.420
on this.

14:38.420 --> 14:39.420
I assume you do.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.420
That's why you're here this far, right?

14:40.420 --> 14:45.580
This is ultimately a negative end result to women who behave this way and think like

14:45.580 --> 14:46.580
this.

14:46.580 --> 14:50.820
Like, I have to assume that just like a lot of the pickup artist guys, a lot of these

14:50.820 --> 14:54.340
girls they're like, they probably went through some pretty bad experiences and this is just

14:54.340 --> 14:59.140
like a trauma response because Jesus Christ, to be this toxic, to be this terrible towards

14:59.140 --> 15:00.140
other people.

15:00.140 --> 15:01.140
It ain't normal.

15:01.140 --> 15:02.140
You know what I mean?

15:02.140 --> 15:06.780
My mission in life is make my husband's life as easy, happy, fun and profitable as possible.

15:06.780 --> 15:09.440
Every action I take is to be an asset to him, not a liability.

15:09.440 --> 15:13.840
Would a modern woman consider me more noble than if I did that for a company instead?

15:13.840 --> 15:14.840
Depends.

15:14.840 --> 15:16.680
Is your husband cutting you a check every week?

15:16.680 --> 15:17.680
How does your prenup look?

15:17.680 --> 15:21.280
Are you prepared to survive without him if he dies or decides his 24 year old secretary

15:21.280 --> 15:22.680
would actually make him happier?

15:22.680 --> 15:26.280
Are your wiping skills transferred to an equally supportive position within someone else?

15:26.280 --> 15:29.200
Burying your head in the sand about the risk you're taking as a trad wife because you hate

15:29.200 --> 15:32.080
feeling like you can't compete with modern women is not a great strategy, sis.

15:32.080 --> 15:33.080
This is like a third position.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.080
Yeah, okay.

15:34.080 --> 15:36.800
So you know third positionism in politics?

15:36.800 --> 15:40.760
This is like third positionism for like the sexual marketplace because you have the modern

15:40.760 --> 15:45.060
woman who does the working for a company, doesn't want to have kids, you know, some

15:45.060 --> 15:49.120
guys don't care, some guys want a more trad wife, you know, whatever, whatever, whatever

15:49.120 --> 15:50.120
you want.

15:50.120 --> 15:53.040
There's the modern woman, there's the trad wife, and then there's like the female dating

15:53.040 --> 15:58.880
strategy poster who like has none of the positives of either of those two options.

15:58.880 --> 16:03.180
This person is looking at sex and romance like it's merely transactional, which is honestly

16:03.180 --> 16:06.740
the problem with a lot of the modern dating scene, but at the same time, they're demanding

16:06.740 --> 16:12.380
a very rigid, very conservative view of what a man should be in the high value male thing.

16:12.380 --> 16:14.740
So they are literally the worst of both worlds.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.940
The men's rights movement is growing and it's terrifying.

16:17.940 --> 16:21.740
I have a feeling that the more people who see female dating strategy, the more people

16:21.740 --> 16:22.760
will join them.

16:22.760 --> 16:23.860
You are causing this problem.

16:23.860 --> 16:27.380
I had a rather sad conversation with my cousin and a family friend the other day.

16:27.380 --> 16:31.540
They were arguing that men have it so hard and at times, even more difficult than women.

16:31.540 --> 16:35.980
Their arguments were this, one, men have an unattainable standard of beauty, two, men

16:35.980 --> 16:40.300
have a harder time getting dates, three, men face so much pressure trying to get good

16:40.300 --> 16:45.060
jobs and be a provider, four, women tell men to open up emotions, but when men do, women

16:45.060 --> 16:48.060
are disgusted, five, women have more social support than men.

16:48.060 --> 16:49.060
Here's the thing.

16:49.060 --> 16:52.300
This is all like pretty true sometimes, at least not all the time, but sometimes definitely.

16:52.300 --> 16:56.460
And not only is it true, these are things that like a female dating strategist would

16:56.460 --> 17:00.100
like Chad yes to it's like, yes, all five of those points, I expect you'd be able to

17:00.100 --> 17:01.100
do them all, all the time.

17:01.100 --> 17:06.460
And it's like, well, why would men lift this kind of a burden if they get absolutely nothing

17:06.460 --> 17:07.460
from it?

17:07.460 --> 17:09.580
Of course, there is always hope.

17:09.580 --> 17:12.940
Really hoping that this is a joke, the audacity of scrotes.

17:12.940 --> 17:16.580
I'm a moderator of female dating strategy on Reddit and I've been masquerading as a

17:16.580 --> 17:21.420
woman to feed them bad advice on how to get men so these toxic bitches never send a chance

17:21.420 --> 17:23.540
and exploiting a male for his baby and money.

17:23.540 --> 17:28.820
Sorry, but not sorry, it had to be done, dude.

17:28.820 --> 17:30.220
Take one for the team.

17:30.220 --> 17:34.740
The other side of female dating strategy is something kind of like women posting their

17:34.740 --> 17:40.220
L's and what you see over here, there's a lot of sad, depressing romance stories from

17:40.220 --> 17:41.300
the woman's perspective.

17:41.300 --> 17:46.380
And this just seems to be the natural end result of the female dating strategy.

17:46.380 --> 17:50.700
It's women who have their standards way too high based on what they themselves bring to

17:50.700 --> 17:52.820
the table, which sometimes isn't that much.

17:52.820 --> 17:55.460
And then experiencing all the bad ends that comes with that.

17:55.460 --> 17:57.340
This is from a person who has an OnlyFans.

17:57.340 --> 18:00.700
I mean, I guess you must know your value, you're getting it right there since you're

18:00.700 --> 18:01.700
literally selling it.

18:01.700 --> 18:05.180
But she says, I tried going on a date last night to feel a bit more normal and social.

18:05.180 --> 18:08.620
This man loved me up until I told him I do OnlyFans, then he left and didn't even pay

18:08.620 --> 18:09.620
for our drinks.

18:09.620 --> 18:13.900
I wasted $60 and was left crying in the middle of a bar by some prick with a receding hairline.

18:13.900 --> 18:17.740
The fact that you think that it's his fault and not yours to the point that you're mad

18:17.740 --> 18:21.040
at him and you're going to insult him over something he can't control, which is his receding

18:21.040 --> 18:24.420
hairline, kind of shows that he's probably right about you.

18:24.420 --> 18:26.540
The idea of being married is so weird.

18:26.540 --> 18:29.920
Like what if I'm having a sad moment late at night and I want to cry in bed and there's

18:29.920 --> 18:31.320
just some guy there.

18:31.320 --> 18:37.300
The fact that you would view your husband as just some guy and not the emotional rock,

18:37.300 --> 18:41.780
the partner that you're moving through life with who would help you during your sad moments,

18:41.780 --> 18:45.860
again, kind of speaks to your toxic, corrupted mindset.

18:45.860 --> 18:48.660
Been dating a married guy for six months now.

18:48.660 --> 18:52.740
He's loving, consistent, and he chose to wait for me for six months without having sex.

18:52.740 --> 18:56.460
Two weeks back we made love and the next day he changed, stopped picking calls and

18:56.460 --> 18:58.180
responding to my texts saying he's busy.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.980
He made me fall in love and I'm now confused.

18:59.980 --> 19:02.680
I mean, he's a piece of shit for cheating, but look what you're doing.

19:02.680 --> 19:05.760
You were fucking around with this guy for six months knowing he was married.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.020
What the fuck is wrong with you?

19:07.020 --> 19:11.140
If I cheated on you, instead of leaving me, just understand the fact that you lack something

19:11.140 --> 19:13.460
which the man I cheated on you with doesn't.

19:13.460 --> 19:17.580
Find out the error in yourself, apologize to me, say sorry, accept it, and become a

19:17.580 --> 19:18.580
better man.

19:18.580 --> 19:20.680
You are actually just a piece of shit.

19:20.680 --> 19:25.040
It's this assumption that woman equals good in all situations.

19:25.040 --> 19:29.680
And so whatever that women do, then it's automatically validated because why not?

19:29.680 --> 19:30.680
Girl power.

19:30.680 --> 19:33.900
Yeah, this whole thing is just depressing.

19:33.900 --> 19:37.660
It's a fundamental misunderstanding of what romance should be, in my opinion.

19:37.660 --> 19:44.520
It's definitely a consequence of the modern day hookup culture and it's not just the fault

19:44.520 --> 19:47.900
of women, but it's also the fault of men because like I said, there is a mere version of this

19:47.900 --> 19:49.700
on the man's side of things.

19:49.700 --> 19:54.260
A truly fulfilling relationship.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.980
You don't keep score like this.

19:56.980 --> 19:59.880
Now you both have to contribute.

19:59.880 --> 20:03.020
It's not that you can just, oh, we're not keeping a score, so I'll just exploit the

20:03.020 --> 20:04.020
fuck out of my partner.

20:04.020 --> 20:05.020
No, you can't do that.

20:05.020 --> 20:11.320
But the idea is you put everything you have into your relationship because you genuinely

20:11.320 --> 20:15.040
care for the other person on both sides.

20:15.040 --> 20:21.160
And if sometimes one of them kind of falls apart because life sucker punches you, sometimes

20:21.160 --> 20:22.160
it happens.

20:22.160 --> 20:26.520
You have a health problem, you lose your job out of nowhere, you get laid off, get into

20:26.520 --> 20:31.760
an accident, whatever it is, there are things that are just not your fault that can happen

20:31.760 --> 20:33.040
to you.

20:33.040 --> 20:37.420
And now suddenly you're not the strong, stable provider.

20:37.420 --> 20:44.360
Now suddenly you're not the cute, perky, happy young woman that he married.

20:44.360 --> 20:51.080
Whatever it is, what keeps you going in those down times, it's not going to be sexual attraction.

20:51.080 --> 20:55.880
It's not going to be any of this kind of ruthless calculus.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.800
It's not going to be money, that can help depending on what you're talking about, but

20:58.800 --> 21:01.060
ultimately it's not going to be money.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.320
It's going to be your love for each other.

21:03.320 --> 21:08.120
The reason that most cultures have this view of monogamy that includes something like,

21:08.120 --> 21:11.540
though not always with the same words every time, but something like in sickness and in

21:11.540 --> 21:18.500
health, rich or poor, stuff like that, is that you're making a commitment to each other,

21:18.500 --> 21:22.060
but you're making a commitment to the metaphysical idea of each other, not just what you can

21:22.060 --> 21:23.060
bring to the table.

21:23.060 --> 21:25.660
That's important, that's not nothing, but it's also not all of it.

21:25.660 --> 21:28.740
And I think that's what these people don't understand.

21:28.740 --> 21:33.060
These genuinely seem like people who are not capable of love.

21:33.060 --> 21:37.740
And honestly, like sometimes when I do a Reddit video on this channel, I'll laugh, I'll have

21:37.740 --> 21:40.940
a good little giggle about it, it'll be like stupidity.

21:40.940 --> 21:42.700
This just made me feel really fucking sad.
