0	11000	Alright chums, I've got about an hour between now and the Skaven RP, I'm currently recording
11000	15560	this on Sunday, and I'm not going to be around for the next few days, so I gotta get something
15560	20280	pre-recorded for Wednesday's video, and I've only got an hour to do it, so I figured we
20280	26700	would look at something that I've been putting off, but here we are, called r slash female
26700	29380	dating strategy.
29380	34980	I first learned of this because of low ping's twitter account, where he posted this story
34980	37020	from r slash female dating strategy.
37020	44500	Got set up with a LVM, got set up with, I think LVM means low value male, got set up
44500	47700	with a low value male and was almost assaulted.
47700	51860	Not too long ago I posted about a guy I met through friends, he seemed perfect, nice guy,
51860	53420	money, hot, tall, etc.
53420	55740	However my friends confessed, he's a virgin.
55740	59700	First red flag, but I ignored it.
59700	64540	So we go on a few dates and he's perfect, kind, pays for it and clearly made an effort.
64540	66420	So fast forward to a few dates later.
66420	70420	I invite him in and start making out and getting pretty frisky, loving it so far, but then
70420	72900	I grab his you know what and it's TINY.
72900	78060	Suddenly his virginity makes sense.
78060	80600	We're still kissing at this point but I just wanted to get out of there now.
80600	83260	I told him to stop and he apologized and got up off the couch.
83260	87020	If I had kept kissing him I'm really worried he'd have kept going and put me through an
87020	88500	awful experience.
88500	90780	Luckily nothing happened but I'm still pretty shook up about it.
90780	93620	I'm going to tell my friends about it tonight so they don't have to put someone else through
93620	94620	this.
94620	95620	I guess the search continues.
95620	101120	Okay so miss size queen here considers a low value male to be somebody with a tiny dick
101120	105380	even though he mentions that he's a nice guy, he has money, he's hot, he's tall, but he's
105380	109080	low value because the penis is small, that's pretty rough.
109080	110840	But re-look at the title.
110840	114680	Got set up with an LVM and was almost assaulted.
114680	116640	Are you fucking kidding me?
116640	119120	You were leaning into him the whole time.
119120	120720	Up until you discovered his dick size.
120720	123800	You were almost assaulted?
123800	127560	We're what a minute into the video and my mind's already blown by this.
127560	131640	So after reading this post I had to go and see just what the fuck female dating strategy
131640	132640	was.
132640	133640	And here it is.
133640	135580	The Female Dating Strategy dot com.
135580	139040	What is female dating strategy aka FDS?
139040	143280	We are a collective of women from all walks of life committed to developing, creating,
143280	146640	and implementing strategies, take control of our lives and narratives, and live a life
146640	148040	of true empowerment.
148040	149640	What is the goal of FDS?
149640	155000	FDS's goal is to deconstruct toxic and self-sabotaging cultural narratives that inhibit women from
155000	158760	living their best lives and entering into relationships that truly benefit them.
158760	163380	We believe in promoting self-advocacy, discarding victim narratives, and serving ourselves and
163380	164640	our future children.
164640	166440	What is your methodology?
166440	170480	Well maximum female benefit.
170480	175460	We seek to locate and define current cultural problems in dating and relationships and create
175460	180480	concrete actionable strategies to maximize our happiness and health while minimizing
180480	181520	overall risk.
181520	185180	We believe the collective mind is stronger than the individual and that dating strategy
185180	188760	is best gleaned from the real experiences of women around the world.
188760	193800	We center our methods in brutal realism about men and our current cultural climate not aspirational
193800	195480	but often practical ideology.
195520	199360	Each of our recommended strategies is weighed by overall risk versus reward based on real
199360	202920	world lived experience and available data to recommend the best course of action.
202920	204360	There's six core principles.
204360	205360	1.
205360	206360	Be a high-value woman.
206360	208280	A high-value woman is a woman who doesn't revolve her life around men.
208280	211120	She has her own career, hobbies, and a great social life that fulfills her emotional needs.
211120	214320	So if she does welcome a man into her life, he better be amazing.
214320	217960	A high-value woman also doesn't romanticize men's true nature, therefore she's cautious
217960	221480	around them and wants them to prove themselves to her before she gets emotionally attached.
221480	222480	2.
222480	223480	Let men chase you.
223480	226880	A man's role is to be the pursuer, the one to convince you that he's the right man
226880	227880	for you.
227880	231260	As a woman, you don't have to prove yourself to him.
231260	232760	He either sees your value or he doesn't.
232760	235560	The only thing that's within your control is working on becoming your best self.
235560	236560	3.
236560	237880	Most men are not of value to you.
237880	241320	The majority of the advances you receive from men are not of any value because the majority
241320	244080	of them are from men who only want to use you for sex.
244080	246320	Many men are sex-driven, low-effort, and entitled.
246320	249240	However, there are also men out there who can be amazing boyfriends and husbands who
249240	252240	know how to be a man and how to take care of you in all ways.
252240	253240	4.
253240	254440	We evaluate men.
254440	259640	We do ourselves in humanity no favors allowing men to exhibit subpar behavior and being rewarded
259640	260640	with our attention.
260640	264400	Thus, be ruthless in cutting off men who add no value to your life.
264400	265400	5.
265400	266880	Make him invest before sex.
266880	269840	Don't have sex before commitment has been established or before he has demonstrated
269840	270840	value in investment.
270840	273680	If a man is really into you and sees you as a girlfriend material, he will commit to you
273680	274840	in two months.
274840	277900	If you're looking to have a dependable friends with benefits, you must still require investment
277900	281480	from him so he provides you with the respect and fun times that you want.
281480	282480	6.
282720	284000	We believe men are non-negotiable.
284000	287920	We believe having your own career and making your own money, a man still has to add financial
287920	290300	value to your life and make you feel like he can take care of you.
290300	293680	This means not splitting the bill and not dating financially challenged men.
293680	309340	So what's interesting about this whole thing is that it feels like the female mirror image
369340	375420	men are not capable of genuine love.
375420	377380	In order to love a woman, they have to see her as human.
377380	380180	That's why most of them would rather keep the privilege of seeing you as an object,
380180	382900	to feel less bad about the mistreatment they put you through.
382900	385860	Hence the porn, aside from the inherent taut misogyny.
385860	389660	It is yet another tool to help them stay unattached, to feed their viewer view as an inanimate
389660	393340	object that should only serve them, an object that deserves to be punished if it is faulty
393340	396920	or dares to disobey, an object that deserves to be used then discarded.
396920	399720	They know they hate women and they are content with it.
399720	401760	So there are certainly some men out there like this.
401760	403680	But this honestly feels like projection.
403680	408440	Like if you go back to those six principles of female dating strategy, like this is the
408440	409880	inverse thing.
409880	414540	Like talking about how men have to prove themselves or men have to have certain kinds of value
414540	419080	or men have to chase you or what like it's this is the inverse situation.
419080	423320	They are complaining about what men do to them, which sometimes happens.
423320	426400	But then they're saying that they should do the same thing back to men.
426400	429280	This one's tagged scroats mad.
429280	430280	Scroats.
430280	431460	All right.
431460	435840	This was posted in a subreddit, which I can't name as I did not break FDS rules, where users
435840	438320	share cringe content.
438320	441000	I fail to see what's cringe about a woman having standards.
441000	443080	This is why males on Reddit are single.
443080	447520	I do not accept a coffee or a walk as a possible date option.
447520	454560	McDonald's it is, but there are times for romantic, reasonably expensive dates.
454560	458560	It's not first date with a new girl who's all made up like this and clearly hunting
458560	459560	for a boyfriend.
459560	463480	If you're going for a coffee in the afternoon and you start sipping on coffee and talking
463480	466420	to them and it turns out, you know what, maybe she just doesn't like you or you just don't
466420	467420	like her.
467420	470240	You can easily just say thank you for your time and peace out.
470240	471240	You're not obligated.
471240	474440	You're not stuck at a restaurant, you know, half an hour from home where you need a ride
474440	475620	to get home.
475620	478960	That is the point of the first date being a little bit low effort.
478960	480920	It's not just because you're cheap.
480920	484600	It's not just because you might not want to invest in somebody right out the gate.
484600	488160	Again, that's actually a pretty good reason why, but it's also because you want there
488160	489960	to be an easy out.
489960	494040	Everyone is so offended that women have standards LMAO and then they shame us and call us sluts
494040	495280	if we have no standards.
495280	498160	This woman isn't obviously isn't going to sleep with just any dude.
498160	501920	She's vetting for a high value male, but nope, that makes her a bitch apparently.
501920	506320	When I see this much makeup, I don't think of somebody who's a high value woman.
506320	510200	I think of somebody who's kind of insecure to be honest, like makeup can look good.
510480	514840	I like when Naomi wears makeup sometimes, but like I wouldn't date somebody who's this
514840	516000	high maintenance.
516000	520360	I want somebody that I can go on adventures with and this does not seem like an adventurous
520360	521360	person.
521360	522840	This seems like a carry me around person.
522840	526600	I want a partner, not a doll that I have to like perfectly take care of.
526600	529900	I just wanted to share something that happened and I hope you guys think it's great as I
529900	530900	do lol.
530900	534460	My son and I have been working our way through the Star Wars canon and we're on season three
534460	535560	of Clone Wars.
535560	539680	For those not familiar, there's a very powerful female Sith named Ventress because she's getting
539680	542440	too powerful as the male Sith Palpatine puts it.
542440	543440	She must be killed.
543440	546240	My son pauses the show, looks at me and goes, how misogynistic.
546240	548280	He only wants to get rid of the powerful females.
548280	549480	Yep, they sure do.
549480	552760	When given a chance to replace her, it's mentioned that maybe a male should be sent.
552760	554560	I was so proud of him to recognize that.
554560	559320	So I've heard some people say that female dating strategy is a right leaning sub.
559320	563880	You know, it's just trad women who are demanding trad men, you know, step up and, but actually
563880	565360	no, that's not how it is at all.
565360	567920	Trad women do not care in this way about misogyny.
567920	570180	Probably not about representation in fucking media.
570180	575400	This is simply the most toxic parts of leftist feminism laid bare.
575400	578280	Never date a guy who studied philosophy.
578280	581520	Last night I went on a Tinder date and for the first time since I ended an LTR that had
581520	582520	become abusive.
582520	584960	Tinder guy seemed intelligent, attractive, employed, all the usual things I look for
584960	585960	in a partner.
585960	586960	I met at the bar and ordered drinks.
586960	589000	As the conversation developed, I could sense he had a really strange attitude.
589000	593600	It was a combination of an unearned sense of superiority, unnecessary oppositional behavior,
593600	597160	and inexplicable misdirected hostility, all poorly concealed under a thinned veil of
597160	598720	self-serving liberalism.
598720	601880	My spidey senses were tingling, so I asked, hey, just curious, what was your major in
601880	602880	university?
602880	603880	But I already knew the answer.
603880	604880	Philosophy.
604880	609680	He said proudly, you know, maybe there's something to this one.
609680	610680	Oh cool.
610680	611680	I said, rolling my eyes.
611680	614800	In my experience, men who study philosophy are just the worst people.
614800	620860	Women who study philosophy are fine because they just want to read and learn and have
620860	621860	cool discussions.
621860	625640	Whereas men who study philosophy seek to dominate, they are so convinced of their own genius
625640	627320	that they constantly interrupt or talk over me.
627320	630640	They will go on and on mansplaining a basic concept I'm already familiar with.
630640	631640	They're boring.
631640	634040	There's, there's definitely something to be said about nerdy philosophy majors.
634040	635040	I understood.
635040	636040	All right.
636040	639320	People who like get a bit too over educated, they're too up their own ass.
639320	640320	Like I get it.
640320	641320	I get it.
641320	642320	Okay.
642320	646480	But this idea that women can't also have that sense of superiority is ridiculous.
646480	650040	All men are predators and misogynists until proven otherwise.
650040	653320	Jesus Christ.
653320	655040	This is going to be a hard pill to swallow.
655040	659820	The majority of men don't value women as people, and I mean the vast majority of men.
659820	663560	Even the men who are in our daily lives that we cherish, I have come to accept that all
663560	665840	men are trash until proven otherwise.
665840	669940	I have found that keeping all men in all situations at arm's length until I have substantial
669940	672080	proof of their character to be very beneficial.
672080	673240	This goes for family too.
673240	677000	I have many male family members that I keep a need to know business style relationship
677000	678000	with.
678000	681280	How a man treats any woman in his life is indicative of how he views women period.
681280	684880	Your male friend likely keeps you around for hopes of sex and then dogs you behind
684880	685880	your back.
685880	689160	Your friends with benefits, shared your nudes to his group chat and mocks your body.
689160	690720	Most of your boyfriends do this too.
690720	692640	The father of the picturesque new killer family.
692640	693640	You know what?
693640	694880	This is, this is insane.
694880	699720	If you said this, if you just changed out man with black and woman with white, these
699720	704400	people would be called the most racist of the fucking racists out there.
704400	709720	Men are slaves to their dicks and they will try to make you a slave to their dicks too.
709720	713280	Um, there's actually a lot of women who are into that.
713280	714280	It never fucking ends.
714280	718120	Go to the dead bedroom sub and there are endless variations of I want sex every day, but she
718120	719120	doesn't.
719120	720120	My wife had a baby a few months ago.
720120	721120	What about my dick?
721120	724960	I want to insert disgusting, degrading porn inspired sex act and she won't.
724960	729040	Should I suggest ethical non-monogamy or my primary love language is fucking.
729040	730660	I can't feel connection either way.
730660	735360	Then when his bullshit needs aren't being met, needs, he goes to porn or cam girls or
735360	738080	affairs all of which introduces instability into the family.
738080	739400	All because of his dick.
739400	742400	Never once does he think that just maybe his dick shouldn't be in control.
742400	746460	Men throw away so much following their dicks, families, self-respect and careers.
746460	748680	This is why men are unfit to lead anything.
748680	750960	Women only suffer reproductive madness once a month.
750960	752640	For men it's a daily existence.
752640	754740	Again, look at the hypocrisy.
754740	758480	Look back at them talking about their needs and how they deserve to have to live their
758480	761240	most full life and all this other fucking nonsense.
761240	764120	But there's no actual care for their partners.
764120	765760	They don't care about these men.
765760	768620	They only care about what can be provided to them.
768620	771000	And they say, yes, of course, I mean, we're women.
771000	772400	We shouldn't be this way.
772400	773400	It's like soulless.
773400	778040	I'm not saying that the guys who do some of this terrible shit are any better.
778040	779040	They're not.
779040	784500	But they have basically taken the worst of the male sex, ignored the best of it, taken
784500	790780	only the worst, stooped down to their level and then justified it while demanding that
790780	792940	men themselves change.
792940	794420	It's insanity, dude.
794420	797140	Why men must give in relationships.
797140	799260	If a man doesn't splurge on you, he doesn't care enough.
799260	803260	When a man finds a woman he really values, he will spend every last penny trying to win
803260	804260	her over.
804260	807780	How many times have you heard of men barely paying for their wife and kids while buying
807780	809780	expensive gifts for their mistresses?
809780	811660	Men like to spend money on women.
811660	813680	There's whole fetish communities around this.
813680	817680	Only if a man feels you aren't a good investment will he be reluctant to spend on you.
817680	819100	Income isn't a factor either.
819100	821080	Even poor men will spend on women.
821080	824700	Don't be caught up with a cheap guy, nor a guy who thinks that money is everything.
824700	826100	It's a minimum requirement, really.
826140	828580	I used to think money didn't matter, but it ain't true.
828580	830460	Gold diggers not even once.
830460	835020	Dear male lurkers, FDS is coming for your girlfriends.
835020	838660	I just want to take a moment to validate all those paranoid thoughts buried deep in your
838660	843300	subconscious that your girlfriend is going to find FDS and dump you for being low value.
843300	846540	Or maybe you're single and you already struggle to get women's attention and deep down you'll
846540	848940	know you'll never find a girlfriend if women raise their standards.
848940	852740	Perhaps you're a wannabe player and browsing this sub makes you rage at the thought of
852740	857700	women expecting more from men and no longer being so easily fooled into casual sex.
857700	858700	It's all true.
858700	859700	Yep, all of it.
859700	860700	It's going to happen.
860700	861700	Only a matter of time.
861700	864500	You know, I'm happy I'm with Naomi.
864500	865500	She's not like this at all.
865500	866860	This is not her personality.
866860	871780	Not all women view relationships in such a calculating way and in fact they find it just
871780	877420	as disgusting to do so as, for example, you and I do, assuming that you agree with me
877420	878420	on this.
878420	879420	I assume you do.
879420	880420	That's why you're here this far, right?
880420	885580	This is ultimately a negative end result to women who behave this way and think like
885580	886580	this.
886580	890820	Like, I have to assume that just like a lot of the pickup artist guys, a lot of these
890820	894340	girls they're like, they probably went through some pretty bad experiences and this is just
894340	899140	like a trauma response because Jesus Christ, to be this toxic, to be this terrible towards
899140	900140	other people.
900140	901140	It ain't normal.
901140	902140	You know what I mean?
902140	906780	My mission in life is make my husband's life as easy, happy, fun and profitable as possible.
906780	909440	Every action I take is to be an asset to him, not a liability.
909440	913840	Would a modern woman consider me more noble than if I did that for a company instead?
913840	914840	Depends.
914840	916680	Is your husband cutting you a check every week?
916680	917680	How does your prenup look?
917680	921280	Are you prepared to survive without him if he dies or decides his 24 year old secretary
921280	922680	would actually make him happier?
922680	926280	Are your wiping skills transferred to an equally supportive position within someone else?
926280	929200	Burying your head in the sand about the risk you're taking as a trad wife because you hate
929200	932080	feeling like you can't compete with modern women is not a great strategy, sis.
932080	933080	This is like a third position.
933080	934080	Yeah, okay.
934080	936800	So you know third positionism in politics?
936800	940760	This is like third positionism for like the sexual marketplace because you have the modern
940760	945060	woman who does the working for a company, doesn't want to have kids, you know, some
945060	949120	guys don't care, some guys want a more trad wife, you know, whatever, whatever, whatever
949120	950120	you want.
950120	953040	There's the modern woman, there's the trad wife, and then there's like the female dating
953040	958880	strategy poster who like has none of the positives of either of those two options.
958880	963180	This person is looking at sex and romance like it's merely transactional, which is honestly
963180	966740	the problem with a lot of the modern dating scene, but at the same time, they're demanding
966740	972380	a very rigid, very conservative view of what a man should be in the high value male thing.
972380	974740	So they are literally the worst of both worlds.
974740	977940	The men's rights movement is growing and it's terrifying.
977940	981740	I have a feeling that the more people who see female dating strategy, the more people
981740	982760	will join them.
982760	983860	You are causing this problem.
983860	987380	I had a rather sad conversation with my cousin and a family friend the other day.
987380	991540	They were arguing that men have it so hard and at times, even more difficult than women.
991540	995980	Their arguments were this, one, men have an unattainable standard of beauty, two, men
995980	1000300	have a harder time getting dates, three, men face so much pressure trying to get good
1000300	1005060	jobs and be a provider, four, women tell men to open up emotions, but when men do, women
1005060	1008060	are disgusted, five, women have more social support than men.
1008060	1009060	Here's the thing.
1009060	1012300	This is all like pretty true sometimes, at least not all the time, but sometimes definitely.
1012300	1016460	And not only is it true, these are things that like a female dating strategist would
1016460	1020100	like Chad yes to it's like, yes, all five of those points, I expect you'd be able to
1020100	1021100	do them all, all the time.
1021100	1026460	And it's like, well, why would men lift this kind of a burden if they get absolutely nothing
1026460	1027460	from it?
1027460	1029580	Of course, there is always hope.
1029580	1032940	Really hoping that this is a joke, the audacity of scrotes.
1032940	1036580	I'm a moderator of female dating strategy on Reddit and I've been masquerading as a
1036580	1041420	woman to feed them bad advice on how to get men so these toxic bitches never send a chance
1041420	1043540	and exploiting a male for his baby and money.
1043540	1048820	Sorry, but not sorry, it had to be done, dude.
1048820	1050220	Take one for the team.
1050220	1054740	The other side of female dating strategy is something kind of like women posting their
1054740	1060220	L's and what you see over here, there's a lot of sad, depressing romance stories from
1060220	1061300	the woman's perspective.
1061300	1066380	And this just seems to be the natural end result of the female dating strategy.
1066380	1070700	It's women who have their standards way too high based on what they themselves bring to
1070700	1072820	the table, which sometimes isn't that much.
1072820	1075460	And then experiencing all the bad ends that comes with that.
1075460	1077340	This is from a person who has an OnlyFans.
1077340	1080700	I mean, I guess you must know your value, you're getting it right there since you're
1080700	1081700	literally selling it.
1081700	1085180	But she says, I tried going on a date last night to feel a bit more normal and social.
1085180	1088620	This man loved me up until I told him I do OnlyFans, then he left and didn't even pay
1088620	1089620	for our drinks.
1089620	1093900	I wasted $60 and was left crying in the middle of a bar by some prick with a receding hairline.
1093900	1097740	The fact that you think that it's his fault and not yours to the point that you're mad
1097740	1101040	at him and you're going to insult him over something he can't control, which is his receding
1101040	1104420	hairline, kind of shows that he's probably right about you.
1104420	1106540	The idea of being married is so weird.
1106540	1109920	Like what if I'm having a sad moment late at night and I want to cry in bed and there's
1109920	1111320	just some guy there.
1111320	1117300	The fact that you would view your husband as just some guy and not the emotional rock,
1117300	1121780	the partner that you're moving through life with who would help you during your sad moments,
1121780	1125860	again, kind of speaks to your toxic, corrupted mindset.
1125860	1128660	Been dating a married guy for six months now.
1128660	1132740	He's loving, consistent, and he chose to wait for me for six months without having sex.
1132740	1136460	Two weeks back we made love and the next day he changed, stopped picking calls and
1136460	1138180	responding to my texts saying he's busy.
1138180	1139980	He made me fall in love and I'm now confused.
1139980	1142680	I mean, he's a piece of shit for cheating, but look what you're doing.
1142680	1145760	You were fucking around with this guy for six months knowing he was married.
1145760	1147020	What the fuck is wrong with you?
1147020	1151140	If I cheated on you, instead of leaving me, just understand the fact that you lack something
1151140	1153460	which the man I cheated on you with doesn't.
1153460	1157580	Find out the error in yourself, apologize to me, say sorry, accept it, and become a
1157580	1158580	better man.
1158580	1160680	You are actually just a piece of shit.
1160680	1165040	It's this assumption that woman equals good in all situations.
1165040	1169680	And so whatever that women do, then it's automatically validated because why not?
1169680	1170680	Girl power.
1170680	1173900	Yeah, this whole thing is just depressing.
1173900	1177660	It's a fundamental misunderstanding of what romance should be, in my opinion.
1177660	1184520	It's definitely a consequence of the modern day hookup culture and it's not just the fault
1184520	1187900	of women, but it's also the fault of men because like I said, there is a mere version of this
1187900	1189700	on the man's side of things.
1189700	1194260	A truly fulfilling relationship.
1194260	1196980	You don't keep score like this.
1196980	1199880	Now you both have to contribute.
1199880	1203020	It's not that you can just, oh, we're not keeping a score, so I'll just exploit the
1203020	1204020	fuck out of my partner.
1204020	1205020	No, you can't do that.
1205020	1211320	But the idea is you put everything you have into your relationship because you genuinely
1211320	1215040	care for the other person on both sides.
1215040	1221160	And if sometimes one of them kind of falls apart because life sucker punches you, sometimes
1221160	1222160	it happens.
1222160	1226520	You have a health problem, you lose your job out of nowhere, you get laid off, get into
1226520	1231760	an accident, whatever it is, there are things that are just not your fault that can happen
1231760	1233040	to you.
1233040	1237420	And now suddenly you're not the strong, stable provider.
1237420	1244360	Now suddenly you're not the cute, perky, happy young woman that he married.
1244360	1251080	Whatever it is, what keeps you going in those down times, it's not going to be sexual attraction.
1251080	1255880	It's not going to be any of this kind of ruthless calculus.
1255880	1258800	It's not going to be money, that can help depending on what you're talking about, but
1258800	1261060	ultimately it's not going to be money.
1261060	1263320	It's going to be your love for each other.
1263320	1268120	The reason that most cultures have this view of monogamy that includes something like,
1268120	1271540	though not always with the same words every time, but something like in sickness and in
1271540	1278500	health, rich or poor, stuff like that, is that you're making a commitment to each other,
1278500	1282060	but you're making a commitment to the metaphysical idea of each other, not just what you can
1282060	1283060	bring to the table.
1283060	1285660	That's important, that's not nothing, but it's also not all of it.
1285660	1288740	And I think that's what these people don't understand.
1288740	1293060	These genuinely seem like people who are not capable of love.
1293060	1297740	And honestly, like sometimes when I do a Reddit video on this channel, I'll laugh, I'll have
1297740	1300940	a good little giggle about it, it'll be like stupidity.
1300940	1302700	This just made me feel really fucking sad.
