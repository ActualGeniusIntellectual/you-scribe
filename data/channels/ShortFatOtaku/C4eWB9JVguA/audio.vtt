Hey this is Dev or I guess you probably know me as the asshole roommate on SFO.

00:16.600 --> 00:20.800
Capcom just released their trailer maybe about a week ago or something for Resident Evil

00:20.800 --> 00:26.840
6 and it showed this snowy landscape in a laboratory and they put out a series of map

00:26.840 --> 00:27.840
coordinates.

00:27.840 --> 00:31.600
When you put them in it sends you to Canada and everyone is like oh man Resident Evil

00:31.600 --> 00:34.400
6 is going to take place in snow we're going to have snow zombies and shit.

00:34.400 --> 00:39.000
If you actually put the coordinates into Google Maps you get Thunder Bay Ontario Canada.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.240
I'm actually here in Thunder Bay because I mean I decided to go back to school here.

00:43.240 --> 00:46.400
CL and I are here because she goes to school here too during the school year so yeah that

00:46.400 --> 00:49.560
means I'm going to be off the show for the next four months but oh well you won't miss

00:49.560 --> 00:50.560
me anyway.

00:50.560 --> 00:54.880
But she actually has yet to come to be online and she didn't want to come outside and actually

00:54.880 --> 00:56.960
do it because she never leaves her house.

00:56.960 --> 01:01.800
Next we have a warning T-Virus sign T-Virus mother fucker wow!

01:01.800 --> 01:07.280
This is pretty much the exact spot like if you look on the Google Maps there's a trail

01:07.280 --> 01:12.000
on university campus there's like a nature trail and then it's off in the bush a bit

01:12.000 --> 01:16.920
the actual spot so we put it on the nature trail as close as we could get but yeah warning

01:16.920 --> 01:21.800
T-Virus this is where Resident Evil 6 is going to be happening oh shit!

01:21.800 --> 01:25.960
This is actually one of the big reasons us being at school and us doing this that you

01:25.960 --> 01:30.200

01:30.200 --> 01:34.200
