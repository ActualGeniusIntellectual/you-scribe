00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,600
Hey this is Dev or I guess you probably know me as the asshole roommate on SFO.

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,800
Capcom just released their trailer maybe about a week ago or something for Resident Evil

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,840
6 and it showed this snowy landscape in a laboratory and they put out a series of map

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,840
coordinates.

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,600
When you put them in it sends you to Canada and everyone is like oh man Resident Evil

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,400
6 is going to take place in snow we're going to have snow zombies and shit.

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,000
If you actually put the coordinates into Google Maps you get Thunder Bay Ontario Canada.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,240
I'm actually here in Thunder Bay because I mean I decided to go back to school here.

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,400
CL and I are here because she goes to school here too during the school year so yeah that

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,560
means I'm going to be off the show for the next four months but oh well you won't miss

11
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,560
me anyway.

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,880
But she actually has yet to come to be online and she didn't want to come outside and actually

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,960
do it because she never leaves her house.

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,800
Next we have a warning T-Virus sign T-Virus mother fucker wow!

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,280
This is pretty much the exact spot like if you look on the Google Maps there's a trail

16
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,000
on university campus there's like a nature trail and then it's off in the bush a bit

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,920
the actual spot so we put it on the nature trail as close as we could get but yeah warning

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,800
T-Virus this is where Resident Evil 6 is going to be happening oh shit!

19
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,960
