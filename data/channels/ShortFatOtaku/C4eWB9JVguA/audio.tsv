26840	27840	coordinates.
27840	31600	When you put them in it sends you to Canada and everyone is like oh man Resident Evil
31600	34400	6 is going to take place in snow we're going to have snow zombies and shit.
34400	39000	If you actually put the coordinates into Google Maps you get Thunder Bay Ontario Canada.
