{"text": " Hey this is Dev or I guess you probably know me as the asshole roommate on SFO. Capcom just released their trailer maybe about a week ago or something for Resident Evil 6 and it showed this snowy landscape in a laboratory and they put out a series of map coordinates. When you put them in it sends you to Canada and everyone is like oh man Resident Evil 6 is going to take place in snow we're going to have snow zombies and shit. If you actually put the coordinates into Google Maps you get Thunder Bay Ontario Canada. I'm actually here in Thunder Bay because I mean I decided to go back to school here. CL and I are here because she goes to school here too during the school year so yeah that means I'm going to be off the show for the next four months but oh well you won't miss me anyway. But she actually has yet to come to be online and she didn't want to come outside and actually do it because she never leaves her house. Next we have a warning T-Virus sign T-Virus mother fucker wow! This is pretty much the exact spot like if you look on the Google Maps there's a trail on university campus there's like a nature trail and then it's off in the bush a bit the actual spot so we put it on the nature trail as close as we could get but yeah warning T-Virus this is where Resident Evil 6 is going to be happening oh shit! This is actually one of the big reasons us being at school and us doing this that you actually haven't seen a new episode in about a month there will be a new one in a couple days I think I am a hobo. WOW!
