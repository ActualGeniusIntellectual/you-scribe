43480	45760	Jesus, it seems like you can declare anything
45760	48080	a human right nowadays with no real argumentation
48080	49720	behind any of it, especially on Twitter
49720	51600	where explaining your ideas in depth
51600	53560	is discouraged by the very nature of the format.
53560	55240	But what is a right?
55240	57360	Well, I'm not exactly sure.
57360	60440	It's been a long time since I read good old John Loki,
60440	62440	but maybe we can formulate a decent idea
62440	65200	of what a right is just by using our own common sense.
65200	66880	I'm not saying this is necessarily correct,
66880	68640	just what seems reasonable to me.
68640	70520	So you've got natural rights, right?
70520	72000	You've heard of that phrase before.
72000	73840	Well, from a layman's point of view,
73840	76240	a natural right seems to be something you're born with.
76240	77520	It's in nature.
77520	79080	Here's a good way to conceptualize it.
79080	80720	Imagine yourself on a deserted island
80720	81840	with nobody else around.
81840	83600	A natural right is anything that you can do
83600	84960	in that situation.
84960	86840	You have the right to speech, obviously.
86840	88200	You can say whatever you like,
88200	89720	unless you're mute or something,
89720	91320	but the exception doesn't discount the rule.
91320	92160	How about this?
92160	94560	The mute person can draw letters in the sand or something.
94560	96640	You have the right to articulate your statement.
96640	99200	Do you have the right to water or food?
99200	101800	No, but you have the right to go and get it.
101800	104920	You can fish or hunt an animal or collect plants to eat.
104920	107200	We could call this something like the right to labor.
107200	109240	You don't have the right to have a fish to eat
109240	111120	because if you did, the natural world
111120	112520	would have a fish fall into your lap
112520	113720	every time you were hungry.
113720	115160	But you do have the right to go out
115200	117520	and try to catch a fish using your own labor.
117520	119200	To me, it would seem that natural rights
119200	121800	include only the right to speak and the right to labor.
121800	123120	And it seems that the right to labor
123120	125560	includes most other possible actions.
125560	127600	The right to gather food, to create clothing,
127600	129200	to build a shelter, to defend yourself
129200	130360	from an attacking animal.
130360	132840	You have the right to do those things, which you can do.
132840	134800	You don't have the right to achieve a positive result
134800	136920	from those actions, but you do have the right
136920	138560	to try and reach that result.
138560	141240	But all of this stuff is a result of living in isolation.
141240	143400	When you add another person to the deserted island,
143440	145440	a person who has the same rights as you,
145440	147240	what do you do when your rights overlap?
147240	148960	Well, you both have the right to speak.
148960	149800	That hasn't changed.
149800	151920	You don't have the right to be heard by the other person,
151920	153800	but you do have the right to say anything you like.
153800	155360	You still have the right to labor,
155360	157600	but what stops the other guy from just rolling in
157600	159440	and stealing that fish after you've caught it?
159440	161020	Well, technically nothing.
161020	163660	You can definitely live in a might makes right society
163660	165920	where there's no negotiation and only force.
165920	168160	After all, the other person's efforts to steal your fish
168160	170400	is still their labor that they have a right to.
170400	172280	But it's also pretty clear why that behavior
172280	174160	doesn't create a stable civilization.
174160	176160	The alternative to this is what I guess
176160	178240	we could call derived rights.
178240	181040	A derived right is the compromise born out of a situation
181040	182960	where the rights of two people conflict.
182960	184880	The new right created from the compromise
184880	186080	solves the conflict.
186080	189520	So for example, a derived right in the fish theft situation
189520	192160	would be the right to the fruits of your labor.
192160	193980	So not only do you have the right to labor,
193980	195900	which would be the right to go out and get the fish,
195900	198060	but you have the right to the produce of your labor,
198060	200200	the right to own, keep, and eat the fish
200200	201480	without having somebody walk up,
201520	203600	club you on the back of the head, and take it from you.
203600	206800	Derived rights are the source of all fruitful cooperation.
206800	208680	So two people can build a net,
208680	210320	go fishing for a much larger haul
210320	212120	than either of them could catch individually,
212120	213960	and agree to split the fruits of their labor.
213960	216920	But derived rights are also the source of individualism.
216920	219080	Let's say we have 10 people on our little island,
219080	221200	and one of them decides to craft himself an ax,
221200	222980	chop down some trees Minecraft style,
222980	224480	and build himself a shelter.
224480	227000	The use of the shelter is the fruits of his labor.
227000	229200	And since he has a right to the fruits of his labor,
229200	231400	he's under no obligation to share his shelter
232280	233100	with anyone else.
233100	233940	He's probably gonna be considered a dick
233940	235160	by the others for not sharing,
235160	237200	but the others don't have the right to his shelter,
237200	239160	only a right to build and enjoy their own.
239160	241360	This is the root of what we call property rights.
241360	242840	It would seem to me that property rights
242840	245120	are simply a more sophisticated form
245120	246700	of the right to the fruits of your labor.
246700	249600	In modern society, money allows us to defer collection
249600	251220	of our labor's fruits to the future.
251220	254000	Back on the island, when we go fishing and catch something,
254000	255480	we get the fish immediately.
255480	259040	But nowadays, a fisherman can fish, get paid for his labor,
259040	262680	then three days later, use that money to buy a fish.
262680	264000	You probably wouldn't buy a fish, obviously,
264000	264840	because he's a fisherman.
264840	266440	He'd likely buy something else.
266440	269000	So money also allows us to labor at a job,
269000	271960	but generate the output of an entirely different job,
271960	273720	using money to make the exchange.
273720	276000	This is why communists are fundamentally wrong, by the way.
276000	278440	Getting paid for your labor is not exploitation
278440	280000	by the CEOs or whatever.
280000	282520	It's simply allowing you to use your labor
282520	285400	to get more stuff than what your job directly produces.
285400	287420	And those CEOs with more money than you,
287420	289340	well, they also perform more labor than you,
289340	291980	whether that's from efficiency born out of experience
291980	293940	or the quality or importance of the work.
293940	296660	So no, communism does not give you the moral high ground
296660	298340	for wanting to steal the richest stuff
298340	300160	just because you're not as rich as they are.
300160	302660	But the derived right is not the only concept generated
302660	304780	when you add a second person to the island.
304780	306540	The other one is responsibility.
306540	308560	When rights play out in reality,
308560	311340	one person's right is everybody else's responsibility.
311340	313260	So for example, you have two people on the island
313260	315440	and one person decides to say something.
315440	317340	Because his speech is a right,
318140	318980	the other person has a responsibility
318980	320380	to not prevent him from speaking.
320380	323000	If you had 10 people on the island and one was speaking,
323000	324620	the other nine have a responsibility
324620	325980	to not prevent him from speaking.
325980	327860	As always, he doesn't have the right to be heard.
327860	329980	The other nine can walk away, ignore him,
329980	331780	counter with their own speech if they like,
331780	333220	but they cannot silence him.
333220	335020	When one person engages in labor,
335020	336180	the other has a responsibility
336180	337720	to not prevent him from doing so.
337720	339340	They have no obligation to assist him
339340	340460	or cooperate with him.
340460	341980	They can even compete with him if they want,
341980	343520	but they can't stop him from working.
343520	346100	And when one person is enjoying the fruits of their labor,
346100	348620	the others have a responsibility to not steal those fruits.
348620	350500	This all sounds pretty good so far, right?
350500	352240	I mean, if you own a house or a car,
352240	354060	everybody else in your society has a responsibility
354060	355500	to not damage it, steal it,
355500	356820	or enter it without your approval.
356820	358540	If you have money or objects,
358540	360140	you have the right to own that stuff
360140	362500	and everybody else has a responsibility to leave it alone.
362500	365060	And you also have those same responsibilities
365060	367060	in regards to everybody else's stuff.
367060	368540	And as we became more advanced,
368540	369980	we began to derive more rights
369980	371380	from our complex interactions.
371380	373700	Freedom of religion, freedom of association,
373700	375920	and freedom of the press are rights derived
375920	377120	from the freedom of speech.
377120	379520	The freedom to be alive, the freedom from slavery
379520	381600	are both derived from the freedom of labor.
381600	383840	You can't work or enjoy the fruits of that work
383840	385680	if you're dead or your property.
385680	387220	As things became more complicated
387220	389380	and we realized that a legal system was necessary
389380	390800	to arbitrate between the many sets
390800	392580	of overlapping rights we all share,
392580	394220	we eventually realized that the functioning
394220	396600	of such a system required the right to a fair trial
396600	397760	and the right to legal counsel.
397760	399960	These are also derived rights, obviously,
399960	401280	and they're fundamentally necessary
401280	403040	because we're fallible creatures dealing
403040	405120	in concepts we still don't fully understand.
405160	406720	I mean, yeah, if you and I are talking
406720	408080	about being on an island,
408080	410220	we can probably map out our overlapping rights
410220	412200	and the resulting compromises pretty quickly.
412200	413580	But can we draw that out
413580	415360	for millions of people simultaneously?
415360	417080	Probably not, that's a huge job.
417080	418120	And it's one of the main reasons
418120	419720	that we even have a court system.
419720	421980	But let's get back to the original point of the video,
421980	423520	all of those relatively new inventions
423520	425020	people are calling rights.
425020	427140	Let's see if they actually are rights.
427140	429880	The most popular one was healthcare is a human right.
429880	433100	Well, it's certainly a human need and nobody denies that,
433100	435080	but does it meet the definition of a right?
435900	436740	Well, let's go back to the island.
436740	437960	Is it a natural right?
437960	439020	Obviously not.
439020	440760	Just like the natural world doesn't plop a fish
440760	442580	into your lap just because you're hungry,
442580	445040	it's also not gonna plop a first aid kit there either.
445040	446440	Is it a derived right,
446440	448640	born out of the interactions between people?
448640	449840	Well, maybe.
449840	451640	But remember, when multiple people are involved,
451640	453560	your rights are everybody else's responsibility.
453560	455640	But remember, when multiple people are involved,
455640	458320	your rights are everybody else's responsibility.
458320	460780	Speech is easy, just don't censor and you're fine.
460780	463080	Property rights are also pretty easy, just don't steal.
463080	465920	But how about a hypothetical right to being cared for?
465920	468320	Remember, this is not a right to go and get healthcare
468320	470200	because that would be a right to the fruits of your labor.
470200	472280	You work, you exchange your labor for healthcare
472280	473120	and you're good.
473120	475580	This is directly the right to healthcare.
475580	478080	That means everybody else has the responsibility
478080	479760	to bring healthcare to you,
479760	482520	regardless of and disconnected from your own labor.
482520	484300	On our little island community,
484300	486880	that might mean if one person is sick or injured,
486880	488760	the other nine people have a responsibility
488760	489600	to care for them.
489600	491540	Well, that seems fine so far.
491540	492940	But because it's their right
492940	494660	and your responsibility to fill it,
494660	496820	you can't have an expectation of compensation.
496820	498600	You don't get a reward for not censoring people.
498600	500500	It's something that you just have to do.
500500	502780	You don't get a reward for not stealing, same thing.
502780	504640	And if healthcare were a human right,
504640	506100	you don't get a reward for providing it.
506100	507800	It's just your responsibility,
507800	509280	one of the many you have to perform
509280	510540	in order to live with other people.
510540	511660	And this is where the objection
511660	513580	to making healthcare a human right comes from.
513580	515740	If healthcare is your human right,
515740	518660	then it's everybody else's responsibility to fulfill, period.
518660	519900	Now, if there's money in the budget
519900	521660	and the doctor can get paid by the state for your care,
521660	522500	then fine.
522500	524920	But if there's no more money, one of two things happens.
524920	527300	Either the government compels the doctor to care for you
527300	528420	under the threat of force,
528420	530300	because if he refuses to care for you,
530300	532620	your rights are violated by his inaction
532620	534480	regardless of his lack of compensation.
534480	536580	Or the healthcare system collapses
536580	538060	because it ends up becoming more profitable
538060	540020	for doctors to go off and labor elsewhere
540020	541140	under a different job.
541140	543500	Since that doctor not getting paid to care for you
543500	545000	still needs to get paid somehow.
545000	547580	In essence, the right to healthcare is incompatible
547580	549300	with the right to the fruit of your own labor.
549340	551780	Because when the chips are down, when the money's run out,
551780	553260	people working in the health services
553260	556340	are obligated to either work without reward or quit working.
556340	557660	Same with the right to housing.
557660	560260	Simply exchange doctor with carpenter, I guess,
560260	561500	and you've got the same argument.
561500	563180	If everybody's got the right to a house,
563180	565980	not to buy one or build one, but to have one,
565980	568220	then workers must labor under state compulsion
568220	569780	to provide them, because failing to do so
569780	571700	would be an abdication of their responsibility
571700	573560	and a violation of other people's rights.
573560	575820	This is again, a major failure of communism.
575820	577840	Communist states would use this justification
577840	579120	to compel people to work,
579800	581640	stating that the people had rights that needed fulfilling
581640	583200	and you had to fulfill them,
583200	584840	regardless of whether you wanted to or not.
584840	587120	People often say that abortion is a human right
587120	588480	and that's a giant can of worms
588480	590060	I'm not prepared to get into in this video.
590060	592080	But if for the sake of argument,
592080	594840	we accept that a woman has a right to seek an abortion,
594840	596640	that does not give her the right to compel
596640	598880	any individual doctor to give it to her.
598880	600600	She doesn't have the right to an abortion,
600600	602360	but the right to try and get one,
602360	604800	like any other right derived from labor.
604800	606360	And I say individual doctor
606360	608920	because that's what it's ultimately all about, individuals.
609560	610320	The healthcare system doesn't exist
610320	612160	beyond the individuals who make it up.
612160	615700	Races, nations, religions, organizations of all types,
615700	617600	they don't exist beyond the individuals within them.
617600	619080	We've only begun to create systems
619080	621800	that exist independently of individuals just recently
621800	624080	with self automated computers and things of that nature.
624080	626440	But we're a long way off before that's relevant.
626440	628680	All collectives are just individuals
628680	631620	and societies that recognize human rights do so
631620	633240	because we recognize that the individual
633240	635520	is the force that rejuvenates the collective.
635520	637160	Every person has the potential to create
637160	638000	or discover something
638000	640240	and bring it back to the collective for everyone to enjoy.
640240	642880	It's why every religious story is at some point
642880	644740	about a single person in the wilderness,
644740	646520	encountering the world itself
646520	648580	and then returning to the city with his new wisdom.
648580	650640	It's why all the most well loved narratives,
650640	652120	the shows, the movies, the books,
652120	653940	follow the hero's journey of childhood,
653940	656240	thrust into adventure, descent into darkness
656240	658400	and the victorious return to civilization.
658400	660560	Human rights are a reflection of that knowledge
660560	662000	that we've figured out the individual
662000	663680	is superordinate to the collective.
663680	665840	Despite the extreme importance of the collective,
665840	667120	because it's the individual
667160	668520	that keeps the collective alive,
668520	670460	every group that has squashed human rights
670460	672820	did so in the name of the collective.
672820	674700	Fascism does it in the name of the state,
674700	676320	Nazism in the name of the race,
676320	679080	communism in the name of the people or the worker,
679080	680560	religions in the name of the believer
680560	681940	and they all inevitably collapse
681940	683040	because the reforming force
683040	685520	that would carry them into the future, the individual,
685520	687640	is crushed along with his rights.
687640	690040	A liberal society recognizes that my rights
690040	692120	are everybody else's responsibility to uphold
692120	693380	and is therefore quite strict
693380	695440	with what actually constitutes a right
695440	697880	so that nobody may have their own rights violated
697880	699520	by their new responsibilities.
699520	701800	The opportunity to go out and get healthcare
701800	704560	like any other labor is absolutely a right
704560	706720	but healthcare itself cannot be a right.
706720	708020	That doesn't mean that I'm against the idea
708020	709440	of a national healthcare system.
709440	711520	I think it's good for people to not just die
711520	713280	because they can't afford the hospital stay
713280	714720	but it's still not a right
714720	717160	and just because you need it doesn't make it a right.
717160	718720	A healthcare service is a privilege
718720	720800	that a wealthy nation can provide its citizens
720800	723180	if and when the books are properly balanced.
723180	724680	It's not a human right
724720	725880	and forcing it to be one
725880	728080	will cause more problems than it will solve.
