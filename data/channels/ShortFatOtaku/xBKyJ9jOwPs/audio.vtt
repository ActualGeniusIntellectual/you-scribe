00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
I keep seeing posts like these ones floating around.

00:02.720 --> 00:04.400
Housing is a human right.

00:04.400 --> 00:06.040
Healthcare is a human right.

00:06.040 --> 00:08.400
Healthcare is a human right, full stop.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.880
Healthcare is a human right, not a privilege.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.560
Asylum is a human right.

00:12.560 --> 00:16.000
Yes, unconditional basic income is a human right.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.280
I assume he means universal.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.240
Climate justice is a human right.

00:20.240 --> 00:21.880
Contraception is a human right.

00:21.880 --> 00:23.720
Freedom of speech is a human right.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.400
Housing is a human right.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.880
Access to water is a human right.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.160
Migration is a human right.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.560
Good quality internet is a human right.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.080
Tampax is a human right.

00:34.080 --> 00:36.280
Not tampons, but that specific brand.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.880
Protesting is a human right.

00:37.880 --> 00:39.560
Basic income is a human right.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.720
Access to public toilets is a human right.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.480
Self-defense is a human right.

00:43.480 --> 00:45.760
Jesus, it seems like you can declare anything

00:45.760 --> 00:48.080
a human right nowadays with no real argumentation

00:48.080 --> 00:49.720
behind any of it, especially on Twitter

00:49.720 --> 00:51.600
where explaining your ideas in depth

00:51.600 --> 00:53.560
is discouraged by the very nature of the format.

00:53.560 --> 00:55.240
But what is a right?

00:55.240 --> 00:57.360
Well, I'm not exactly sure.

00:57.360 --> 01:00.440
It's been a long time since I read good old John Loki,

01:00.440 --> 01:02.440
but maybe we can formulate a decent idea

01:02.440 --> 01:05.200
of what a right is just by using our own common sense.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.880
I'm not saying this is necessarily correct,

01:06.880 --> 01:08.640
just what seems reasonable to me.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.520
So you've got natural rights, right?

01:10.520 --> 01:12.000
You've heard of that phrase before.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.840
Well, from a layman's point of view,

01:13.840 --> 01:16.240
a natural right seems to be something you're born with.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.520
It's in nature.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.080
Here's a good way to conceptualize it.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.720
Imagine yourself on a deserted island

01:20.720 --> 01:21.840
with nobody else around.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.600
A natural right is anything that you can do

01:23.600 --> 01:24.960
in that situation.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.840
You have the right to speech, obviously.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.200
You can say whatever you like,

01:28.200 --> 01:29.720
unless you're mute or something,

01:29.720 --> 01:31.320
but the exception doesn't discount the rule.

01:31.320 --> 01:32.160
How about this?

01:32.160 --> 01:34.560
The mute person can draw letters in the sand or something.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.640
You have the right to articulate your statement.

01:36.640 --> 01:39.200
Do you have the right to water or food?

01:39.200 --> 01:41.800
No, but you have the right to go and get it.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.920
You can fish or hunt an animal or collect plants to eat.

01:44.920 --> 01:47.200
We could call this something like the right to labor.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.240
You don't have the right to have a fish to eat

01:49.240 --> 01:51.120
because if you did, the natural world

01:51.120 --> 01:52.520
would have a fish fall into your lap

01:52.520 --> 01:53.720
every time you were hungry.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.160
But you do have the right to go out

01:55.200 --> 01:57.520
and try to catch a fish using your own labor.

01:57.520 --> 01:59.200
To me, it would seem that natural rights

01:59.200 --> 02:01.800
include only the right to speak and the right to labor.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.120
And it seems that the right to labor

02:03.120 --> 02:05.560
includes most other possible actions.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.600
The right to gather food, to create clothing,

02:07.600 --> 02:09.200
to build a shelter, to defend yourself

02:09.200 --> 02:10.360
from an attacking animal.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.840
You have the right to do those things, which you can do.

02:12.840 --> 02:14.800
You don't have the right to achieve a positive result

02:14.800 --> 02:16.920
from those actions, but you do have the right

02:16.920 --> 02:18.560
to try and reach that result.

02:18.560 --> 02:21.240
But all of this stuff is a result of living in isolation.

02:21.240 --> 02:23.400
When you add another person to the deserted island,

02:23.440 --> 02:25.440
a person who has the same rights as you,

02:25.440 --> 02:27.240
what do you do when your rights overlap?

02:27.240 --> 02:28.960
Well, you both have the right to speak.

02:28.960 --> 02:29.800
That hasn't changed.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.920
You don't have the right to be heard by the other person,

02:31.920 --> 02:33.800
but you do have the right to say anything you like.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.360
You still have the right to labor,

02:35.360 --> 02:37.600
but what stops the other guy from just rolling in

02:37.600 --> 02:39.440
and stealing that fish after you've caught it?

02:39.440 --> 02:41.020
Well, technically nothing.

02:41.020 --> 02:43.660
You can definitely live in a might makes right society

02:43.660 --> 02:45.920
where there's no negotiation and only force.

02:45.920 --> 02:48.160
After all, the other person's efforts to steal your fish

02:48.160 --> 02:50.400
is still their labor that they have a right to.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.280
But it's also pretty clear why that behavior

02:52.280 --> 02:54.160
doesn't create a stable civilization.

02:54.160 --> 02:56.160
The alternative to this is what I guess

02:56.160 --> 02:58.240
we could call derived rights.

02:58.240 --> 03:01.040
A derived right is the compromise born out of a situation

03:01.040 --> 03:02.960
where the rights of two people conflict.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.880
The new right created from the compromise

03:04.880 --> 03:06.080
solves the conflict.

03:06.080 --> 03:09.520
So for example, a derived right in the fish theft situation

03:09.520 --> 03:12.160
would be the right to the fruits of your labor.

03:12.160 --> 03:13.980
So not only do you have the right to labor,

03:13.980 --> 03:15.900
which would be the right to go out and get the fish,

03:15.900 --> 03:18.060
but you have the right to the produce of your labor,

03:18.060 --> 03:20.200
the right to own, keep, and eat the fish

03:20.200 --> 03:21.480
without having somebody walk up,

03:21.520 --> 03:23.600
club you on the back of the head, and take it from you.

03:23.600 --> 03:26.800
Derived rights are the source of all fruitful cooperation.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.680
So two people can build a net,

03:28.680 --> 03:30.320
go fishing for a much larger haul

03:30.320 --> 03:32.120
than either of them could catch individually,

03:32.120 --> 03:33.960
and agree to split the fruits of their labor.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.920
But derived rights are also the source of individualism.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.080
Let's say we have 10 people on our little island,

03:39.080 --> 03:41.200
and one of them decides to craft himself an ax,

03:41.200 --> 03:42.980
chop down some trees Minecraft style,

03:42.980 --> 03:44.480
and build himself a shelter.

03:44.480 --> 03:47.000
The use of the shelter is the fruits of his labor.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.200
And since he has a right to the fruits of his labor,

03:49.200 --> 03:51.400
he's under no obligation to share his shelter

03:52.280 --> 03:53.100
with anyone else.

03:53.100 --> 03:53.940
He's probably gonna be considered a dick

03:53.940 --> 03:55.160
by the others for not sharing,

03:55.160 --> 03:57.200
but the others don't have the right to his shelter,

03:57.200 --> 03:59.160
only a right to build and enjoy their own.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.360
This is the root of what we call property rights.

04:01.360 --> 04:02.840
It would seem to me that property rights

04:02.840 --> 04:05.120
are simply a more sophisticated form

04:05.120 --> 04:06.700
of the right to the fruits of your labor.

04:06.700 --> 04:09.600
In modern society, money allows us to defer collection

04:09.600 --> 04:11.220
of our labor's fruits to the future.

04:11.220 --> 04:14.000
Back on the island, when we go fishing and catch something,

04:14.000 --> 04:15.480
we get the fish immediately.

04:15.480 --> 04:19.040
But nowadays, a fisherman can fish, get paid for his labor,

04:19.040 --> 04:22.680
then three days later, use that money to buy a fish.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.000
You probably wouldn't buy a fish, obviously,

04:24.000 --> 04:24.840
because he's a fisherman.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.440
He'd likely buy something else.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.000
So money also allows us to labor at a job,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.960
but generate the output of an entirely different job,

04:31.960 --> 04:33.720
using money to make the exchange.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.000
This is why communists are fundamentally wrong, by the way.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.440
Getting paid for your labor is not exploitation

04:38.440 --> 04:40.000
by the CEOs or whatever.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.520
It's simply allowing you to use your labor

04:42.520 --> 04:45.400
to get more stuff than what your job directly produces.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.420
And those CEOs with more money than you,

04:47.420 --> 04:49.340
well, they also perform more labor than you,

04:49.340 --> 04:51.980
whether that's from efficiency born out of experience

04:51.980 --> 04:53.940
or the quality or importance of the work.

04:53.940 --> 04:56.660
So no, communism does not give you the moral high ground

04:56.660 --> 04:58.340
for wanting to steal the richest stuff

04:58.340 --> 05:00.160
just because you're not as rich as they are.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.660
But the derived right is not the only concept generated

05:02.660 --> 05:04.780
when you add a second person to the island.

05:04.780 --> 05:06.540
The other one is responsibility.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.560
When rights play out in reality,

05:08.560 --> 05:11.340
one person's right is everybody else's responsibility.

05:11.340 --> 05:13.260
So for example, you have two people on the island

05:13.260 --> 05:15.440
and one person decides to say something.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.340
Because his speech is a right,

05:18.140 --> 05:18.980
the other person has a responsibility

05:18.980 --> 05:20.380
to not prevent him from speaking.

05:20.380 --> 05:23.000
If you had 10 people on the island and one was speaking,

05:23.000 --> 05:24.620
the other nine have a responsibility

05:24.620 --> 05:25.980
to not prevent him from speaking.

05:25.980 --> 05:27.860
As always, he doesn't have the right to be heard.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.980
The other nine can walk away, ignore him,

05:29.980 --> 05:31.780
counter with their own speech if they like,

05:31.780 --> 05:33.220
but they cannot silence him.

05:33.220 --> 05:35.020
When one person engages in labor,

05:35.020 --> 05:36.180
the other has a responsibility

05:36.180 --> 05:37.720
to not prevent him from doing so.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.340
They have no obligation to assist him

05:39.340 --> 05:40.460
or cooperate with him.

05:40.460 --> 05:41.980
They can even compete with him if they want,

05:41.980 --> 05:43.520
but they can't stop him from working.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.100
And when one person is enjoying the fruits of their labor,

05:46.100 --> 05:48.620
the others have a responsibility to not steal those fruits.

05:48.620 --> 05:50.500
This all sounds pretty good so far, right?

05:50.500 --> 05:52.240
I mean, if you own a house or a car,

05:52.240 --> 05:54.060
everybody else in your society has a responsibility

05:54.060 --> 05:55.500
to not damage it, steal it,

05:55.500 --> 05:56.820
or enter it without your approval.

05:56.820 --> 05:58.540
If you have money or objects,

05:58.540 --> 06:00.140
you have the right to own that stuff

06:00.140 --> 06:02.500
and everybody else has a responsibility to leave it alone.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.060
And you also have those same responsibilities

06:05.060 --> 06:07.060
in regards to everybody else's stuff.

06:07.060 --> 06:08.540
And as we became more advanced,

06:08.540 --> 06:09.980
we began to derive more rights

06:09.980 --> 06:11.380
from our complex interactions.

06:11.380 --> 06:13.700
Freedom of religion, freedom of association,

06:13.700 --> 06:15.920
and freedom of the press are rights derived

06:15.920 --> 06:17.120
from the freedom of speech.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.520
The freedom to be alive, the freedom from slavery

06:19.520 --> 06:21.600
are both derived from the freedom of labor.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.840
You can't work or enjoy the fruits of that work

06:23.840 --> 06:25.680
if you're dead or your property.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.220
As things became more complicated

06:27.220 --> 06:29.380
and we realized that a legal system was necessary

06:29.380 --> 06:30.800
to arbitrate between the many sets

06:30.800 --> 06:32.580
of overlapping rights we all share,

06:32.580 --> 06:34.220
we eventually realized that the functioning

06:34.220 --> 06:36.600
of such a system required the right to a fair trial

06:36.600 --> 06:37.760
and the right to legal counsel.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.960
These are also derived rights, obviously,

06:39.960 --> 06:41.280
and they're fundamentally necessary

06:41.280 --> 06:43.040
because we're fallible creatures dealing

06:43.040 --> 06:45.120
in concepts we still don't fully understand.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.720
I mean, yeah, if you and I are talking

06:46.720 --> 06:48.080
about being on an island,

06:48.080 --> 06:50.220
we can probably map out our overlapping rights

06:50.220 --> 06:52.200
and the resulting compromises pretty quickly.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.580
But can we draw that out

06:53.580 --> 06:55.360
for millions of people simultaneously?

06:55.360 --> 06:57.080
Probably not, that's a huge job.

06:57.080 --> 06:58.120
And it's one of the main reasons

06:58.120 --> 06:59.720
that we even have a court system.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.980
But let's get back to the original point of the video,

07:01.980 --> 07:03.520
all of those relatively new inventions

07:03.520 --> 07:05.020
people are calling rights.

07:05.020 --> 07:07.140
Let's see if they actually are rights.

07:07.140 --> 07:09.880
The most popular one was healthcare is a human right.

07:09.880 --> 07:13.100
Well, it's certainly a human need and nobody denies that,

07:13.100 --> 07:15.080
but does it meet the definition of a right?

07:15.900 --> 07:16.740
Well, let's go back to the island.

07:16.740 --> 07:17.960
Is it a natural right?

07:17.960 --> 07:19.020
Obviously not.

07:19.020 --> 07:20.760
Just like the natural world doesn't plop a fish

07:20.760 --> 07:22.580
into your lap just because you're hungry,

07:22.580 --> 07:25.040
it's also not gonna plop a first aid kit there either.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.440
Is it a derived right,

07:26.440 --> 07:28.640
born out of the interactions between people?

07:28.640 --> 07:29.840
Well, maybe.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.640
But remember, when multiple people are involved,

07:31.640 --> 07:33.560
your rights are everybody else's responsibility.

07:33.560 --> 07:35.640
But remember, when multiple people are involved,

07:35.640 --> 07:38.320
your rights are everybody else's responsibility.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.780
Speech is easy, just don't censor and you're fine.

07:40.780 --> 07:43.080
Property rights are also pretty easy, just don't steal.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.920
But how about a hypothetical right to being cared for?

07:45.920 --> 07:48.320
Remember, this is not a right to go and get healthcare

07:48.320 --> 07:50.200
because that would be a right to the fruits of your labor.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.280
You work, you exchange your labor for healthcare

07:52.280 --> 07:53.120
and you're good.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.580
This is directly the right to healthcare.

07:55.580 --> 07:58.080
That means everybody else has the responsibility

07:58.080 --> 07:59.760
to bring healthcare to you,

07:59.760 --> 08:02.520
regardless of and disconnected from your own labor.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.300
On our little island community,

08:04.300 --> 08:06.880
that might mean if one person is sick or injured,

08:06.880 --> 08:08.760
the other nine people have a responsibility

08:08.760 --> 08:09.600
to care for them.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.540
Well, that seems fine so far.

08:11.540 --> 08:12.940
But because it's their right

08:12.940 --> 08:14.660
and your responsibility to fill it,

08:14.660 --> 08:16.820
you can't have an expectation of compensation.

08:16.820 --> 08:18.600
You don't get a reward for not censoring people.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.500
It's something that you just have to do.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.780
You don't get a reward for not stealing, same thing.

08:22.780 --> 08:24.640
And if healthcare were a human right,

08:24.640 --> 08:26.100
you don't get a reward for providing it.

08:26.100 --> 08:27.800
It's just your responsibility,

08:27.800 --> 08:29.280
one of the many you have to perform

08:29.280 --> 08:30.540
in order to live with other people.

08:30.540 --> 08:31.660
And this is where the objection

08:31.660 --> 08:33.580
to making healthcare a human right comes from.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.740
If healthcare is your human right,

08:35.740 --> 08:38.660
then it's everybody else's responsibility to fulfill, period.

08:38.660 --> 08:39.900
Now, if there's money in the budget

08:39.900 --> 08:41.660
and the doctor can get paid by the state for your care,

08:41.660 --> 08:42.500
then fine.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.920
But if there's no more money, one of two things happens.

08:44.920 --> 08:47.300
Either the government compels the doctor to care for you

08:47.300 --> 08:48.420
under the threat of force,

08:48.420 --> 08:50.300
because if he refuses to care for you,

08:50.300 --> 08:52.620
your rights are violated by his inaction

08:52.620 --> 08:54.480
regardless of his lack of compensation.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.580
Or the healthcare system collapses

08:56.580 --> 08:58.060
because it ends up becoming more profitable

08:58.060 --> 09:00.020
for doctors to go off and labor elsewhere

09:00.020 --> 09:01.140
under a different job.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.500
Since that doctor not getting paid to care for you

09:03.500 --> 09:05.000
still needs to get paid somehow.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.580
In essence, the right to healthcare is incompatible

09:07.580 --> 09:09.300
with the right to the fruit of your own labor.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.780
Because when the chips are down, when the money's run out,

09:11.780 --> 09:13.260
people working in the health services

09:13.260 --> 09:16.340
are obligated to either work without reward or quit working.

09:16.340 --> 09:17.660
Same with the right to housing.

09:17.660 --> 09:20.260
Simply exchange doctor with carpenter, I guess,

09:20.260 --> 09:21.500
and you've got the same argument.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.180
If everybody's got the right to a house,

09:23.180 --> 09:25.980
not to buy one or build one, but to have one,

09:25.980 --> 09:28.220
then workers must labor under state compulsion

09:28.220 --> 09:29.780
to provide them, because failing to do so

09:29.780 --> 09:31.700
would be an abdication of their responsibility

09:31.700 --> 09:33.560
and a violation of other people's rights.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.820
This is again, a major failure of communism.

09:35.820 --> 09:37.840
Communist states would use this justification

09:37.840 --> 09:39.120
to compel people to work,

09:39.800 --> 09:41.640
stating that the people had rights that needed fulfilling

09:41.640 --> 09:43.200
and you had to fulfill them,

09:43.200 --> 09:44.840
regardless of whether you wanted to or not.

09:44.840 --> 09:47.120
People often say that abortion is a human right

09:47.120 --> 09:48.480
and that's a giant can of worms

09:48.480 --> 09:50.060
I'm not prepared to get into in this video.

09:50.060 --> 09:52.080
But if for the sake of argument,

09:52.080 --> 09:54.840
we accept that a woman has a right to seek an abortion,

09:54.840 --> 09:56.640
that does not give her the right to compel

09:56.640 --> 09:58.880
any individual doctor to give it to her.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.600
She doesn't have the right to an abortion,

10:00.600 --> 10:02.360
but the right to try and get one,

10:02.360 --> 10:04.800
like any other right derived from labor.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.360
And I say individual doctor

10:06.360 --> 10:08.920
because that's what it's ultimately all about, individuals.

10:09.560 --> 10:10.320
The healthcare system doesn't exist

10:10.320 --> 10:12.160
beyond the individuals who make it up.

10:12.160 --> 10:15.700
Races, nations, religions, organizations of all types,

10:15.700 --> 10:17.600
they don't exist beyond the individuals within them.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.080
We've only begun to create systems

10:19.080 --> 10:21.800
that exist independently of individuals just recently

10:21.800 --> 10:24.080
with self automated computers and things of that nature.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.440
But we're a long way off before that's relevant.

10:26.440 --> 10:28.680
All collectives are just individuals

10:28.680 --> 10:31.620
and societies that recognize human rights do so

10:31.620 --> 10:33.240
because we recognize that the individual

10:33.240 --> 10:35.520
is the force that rejuvenates the collective.

10:35.520 --> 10:37.160
Every person has the potential to create

10:37.160 --> 10:38.000
or discover something

10:38.000 --> 10:40.240
and bring it back to the collective for everyone to enjoy.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.880
It's why every religious story is at some point

10:42.880 --> 10:44.740
about a single person in the wilderness,

10:44.740 --> 10:46.520
encountering the world itself

10:46.520 --> 10:48.580
and then returning to the city with his new wisdom.

10:48.580 --> 10:50.640
It's why all the most well loved narratives,

10:50.640 --> 10:52.120
the shows, the movies, the books,

10:52.120 --> 10:53.940
follow the hero's journey of childhood,

10:53.940 --> 10:56.240
thrust into adventure, descent into darkness

10:56.240 --> 10:58.400
and the victorious return to civilization.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.560
Human rights are a reflection of that knowledge

11:00.560 --> 11:02.000
that we've figured out the individual

11:02.000 --> 11:03.680
is superordinate to the collective.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.840
Despite the extreme importance of the collective,

11:05.840 --> 11:07.120
because it's the individual

11:07.160 --> 11:08.520
that keeps the collective alive,

11:08.520 --> 11:10.460
every group that has squashed human rights

11:10.460 --> 11:12.820
did so in the name of the collective.

11:12.820 --> 11:14.700
Fascism does it in the name of the state,

11:14.700 --> 11:16.320
Nazism in the name of the race,

11:16.320 --> 11:19.080
communism in the name of the people or the worker,

11:19.080 --> 11:20.560
religions in the name of the believer

11:20.560 --> 11:21.940
and they all inevitably collapse

11:21.940 --> 11:23.040
because the reforming force

11:23.040 --> 11:25.520
that would carry them into the future, the individual,

11:25.520 --> 11:27.640
is crushed along with his rights.

11:27.640 --> 11:30.040
A liberal society recognizes that my rights

11:30.040 --> 11:32.120
are everybody else's responsibility to uphold

11:32.120 --> 11:33.380
and is therefore quite strict

11:33.380 --> 11:35.440
with what actually constitutes a right

11:35.440 --> 11:37.880
so that nobody may have their own rights violated

11:37.880 --> 11:39.520
by their new responsibilities.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.800
The opportunity to go out and get healthcare

11:41.800 --> 11:44.560
like any other labor is absolutely a right

11:44.560 --> 11:46.720
but healthcare itself cannot be a right.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.020
That doesn't mean that I'm against the idea

11:48.020 --> 11:49.440
of a national healthcare system.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.520
I think it's good for people to not just die

11:51.520 --> 11:53.280
because they can't afford the hospital stay

11:53.280 --> 11:54.720
but it's still not a right

11:54.720 --> 11:57.160
and just because you need it doesn't make it a right.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.720
A healthcare service is a privilege

11:58.720 --> 12:00.800
that a wealthy nation can provide its citizens

12:00.800 --> 12:03.180
if and when the books are properly balanced.

12:03.180 --> 12:04.680
It's not a human right

12:04.720 --> 12:05.880
and forcing it to be one

12:05.880 --> 12:08.080
will cause more problems than it will solve.
