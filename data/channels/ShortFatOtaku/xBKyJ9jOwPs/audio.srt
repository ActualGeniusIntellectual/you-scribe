00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
I keep seeing posts like these ones floating around.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,400
Housing is a human right.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,040
Healthcare is a human right.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,400
Healthcare is a human right, full stop.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,880
Healthcare is a human right, not a privilege.

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,560
Asylum is a human right.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, unconditional basic income is a human right.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,280
I assume he means universal.

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,240
Climate justice is a human right.

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,880
Contraception is a human right.

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,720
Freedom of speech is a human right.

12
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,400
Housing is a human right.

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,880
Access to water is a human right.

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,160
Migration is a human right.

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,560
Good quality internet is a human right.

16
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,080
Tampax is a human right.

17
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,280
Not tampons, but that specific brand.

18
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,880
Protesting is a human right.

19
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,560
Basic income is a human right.

20
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,720
Access to public toilets is a human right.

21
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,480
Self-defense is a human right.

22
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,760
Jesus, it seems like you can declare anything

23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,080
a human right nowadays with no real argumentation

24
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,720
behind any of it, especially on Twitter

25
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,600
where explaining your ideas in depth

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,560
is discouraged by the very nature of the format.

27
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,240
But what is a right?

28
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,360
Well, I'm not exactly sure.

29
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,440
It's been a long time since I read good old John Loki,

30
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,440
but maybe we can formulate a decent idea

31
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,200
of what a right is just by using our own common sense.

32
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,880
I'm not saying this is necessarily correct,

33
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,640
just what seems reasonable to me.

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,520
So you've got natural rights, right?

35
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,000
You've heard of that phrase before.

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,840
Well, from a layman's point of view,

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,240
a natural right seems to be something you're born with.

38
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,520
It's in nature.

39
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,080
Here's a good way to conceptualize it.

40
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,720
Imagine yourself on a deserted island

41
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,840
with nobody else around.

42
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,600
A natural right is anything that you can do

43
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,960
in that situation.

44
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,840
You have the right to speech, obviously.

45
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,200
You can say whatever you like,

46
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,720
unless you're mute or something,

47
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,320
but the exception doesn't discount the rule.

48
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,160
How about this?

49
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,560
The mute person can draw letters in the sand or something.

50
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,640
You have the right to articulate your statement.

51
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,200
Do you have the right to water or food?

52
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,800
No, but you have the right to go and get it.

53
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,920
You can fish or hunt an animal or collect plants to eat.

54
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,200
We could call this something like the right to labor.

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,240
You don't have the right to have a fish to eat

56
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,120
because if you did, the natural world

57
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,520
would have a fish fall into your lap

58
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,720
every time you were hungry.

59
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,160
But you do have the right to go out

60
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,520
and try to catch a fish using your own labor.

61
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,200
To me, it would seem that natural rights

62
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,800
include only the right to speak and the right to labor.

63
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,120
And it seems that the right to labor

64
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,560
includes most other possible actions.

65
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,600
The right to gather food, to create clothing,

66
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,200
to build a shelter, to defend yourself

67
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,360
from an attacking animal.

68
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,840
You have the right to do those things, which you can do.

69
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,800
You don't have the right to achieve a positive result

70
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,920
from those actions, but you do have the right

71
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,560
to try and reach that result.

72
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,240
But all of this stuff is a result of living in isolation.

73
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,400
When you add another person to the deserted island,

74
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440
a person who has the same rights as you,

75
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,240
what do you do when your rights overlap?

76
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,960
Well, you both have the right to speak.

77
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,800
That hasn't changed.

78
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,920
You don't have the right to be heard by the other person,

79
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,800
but you do have the right to say anything you like.

80
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,360
You still have the right to labor,

81
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,600
but what stops the other guy from just rolling in

82
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,440
and stealing that fish after you've caught it?

83
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,020
Well, technically nothing.

84
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,660
You can definitely live in a might makes right society

85
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,920
where there's no negotiation and only force.

86
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,160
After all, the other person's efforts to steal your fish

87
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,400
is still their labor that they have a right to.

88
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,280
But it's also pretty clear why that behavior

89
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,160
doesn't create a stable civilization.

90
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,160
The alternative to this is what I guess

91
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,240
we could call derived rights.

92
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,040
A derived right is the compromise born out of a situation

93
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,960
where the rights of two people conflict.

94
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,880
The new right created from the compromise

95
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,080
solves the conflict.

96
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,520
So for example, a derived right in the fish theft situation

97
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,160
would be the right to the fruits of your labor.

98
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,980
So not only do you have the right to labor,

99
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,900
which would be the right to go out and get the fish,

100
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,060
but you have the right to the produce of your labor,

101
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,200
the right to own, keep, and eat the fish

102
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,480
without having somebody walk up,

103
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,600
club you on the back of the head, and take it from you.

104
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,800
Derived rights are the source of all fruitful cooperation.

105
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,680
So two people can build a net,

106
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,320
go fishing for a much larger haul

107
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,120
than either of them could catch individually,

108
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,960
and agree to split the fruits of their labor.

109
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,920
But derived rights are also the source of individualism.

110
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,080
Let's say we have 10 people on our little island,

111
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,200
and one of them decides to craft himself an ax,

112
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,980
chop down some trees Minecraft style,

113
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,480
and build himself a shelter.

114
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,000
The use of the shelter is the fruits of his labor.

115
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,200
And since he has a right to the fruits of his labor,

116
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,400
he's under no obligation to share his shelter

117
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,100
with anyone else.

118
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,940
He's probably gonna be considered a dick

119
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,160
by the others for not sharing,

120
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,200
but the others don't have the right to his shelter,

121
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,160
only a right to build and enjoy their own.

122
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,360
This is the root of what we call property rights.

123
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,840
It would seem to me that property rights

124
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,120
are simply a more sophisticated form

125
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,700
of the right to the fruits of your labor.

126
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,600
In modern society, money allows us to defer collection

127
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,220
of our labor's fruits to the future.

128
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,000
Back on the island, when we go fishing and catch something,

129
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,480
we get the fish immediately.

130
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,040
But nowadays, a fisherman can fish, get paid for his labor,

131
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,680
then three days later, use that money to buy a fish.

132
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,000
You probably wouldn't buy a fish, obviously,

133
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,840
because he's a fisherman.

134
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,440
He'd likely buy something else.

135
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,000
So money also allows us to labor at a job,

136
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,960
but generate the output of an entirely different job,

137
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,720
using money to make the exchange.

138
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,000
This is why communists are fundamentally wrong, by the way.

139
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,440
Getting paid for your labor is not exploitation

140
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,000
by the CEOs or whatever.

141
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,520
It's simply allowing you to use your labor

142
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,400
to get more stuff than what your job directly produces.

143
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,420
And those CEOs with more money than you,

144
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,340
well, they also perform more labor than you,

145
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,980
whether that's from efficiency born out of experience

146
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,940
or the quality or importance of the work.

147
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,660
So no, communism does not give you the moral high ground

148
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,340
for wanting to steal the richest stuff

149
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,160
just because you're not as rich as they are.

150
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,660
But the derived right is not the only concept generated

151
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,780
when you add a second person to the island.

152
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,540
The other one is responsibility.

153
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,560
When rights play out in reality,

154
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,340
one person's right is everybody else's responsibility.

155
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,260
So for example, you have two people on the island

156
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,440
and one person decides to say something.

157
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,340
Because his speech is a right,

158
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,980
the other person has a responsibility

159
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,380
to not prevent him from speaking.

160
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,000
If you had 10 people on the island and one was speaking,

161
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,620
the other nine have a responsibility

162
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,980
to not prevent him from speaking.

163
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,860
As always, he doesn't have the right to be heard.

164
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,980
The other nine can walk away, ignore him,

165
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,780
counter with their own speech if they like,

166
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,220
but they cannot silence him.

167
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,020
When one person engages in labor,

168
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,180
the other has a responsibility

169
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,720
to not prevent him from doing so.

170
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,340
They have no obligation to assist him

171
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,460
or cooperate with him.

172
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,980
They can even compete with him if they want,

173
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,520
but they can't stop him from working.

174
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,100
And when one person is enjoying the fruits of their labor,

175
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,620
the others have a responsibility to not steal those fruits.

176
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,500
This all sounds pretty good so far, right?

177
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,240
I mean, if you own a house or a car,

178
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,060
everybody else in your society has a responsibility

179
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,500
to not damage it, steal it,

180
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,820
or enter it without your approval.

181
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,540
If you have money or objects,

182
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,140
you have the right to own that stuff

183
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,500
and everybody else has a responsibility to leave it alone.

184
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,060
And you also have those same responsibilities

185
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,060
in regards to everybody else's stuff.

186
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,540
And as we became more advanced,

187
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,980
we began to derive more rights

188
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,380
from our complex interactions.

189
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,700
Freedom of religion, freedom of association,

190
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,920
and freedom of the press are rights derived

191
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,120
from the freedom of speech.

192
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,520
The freedom to be alive, the freedom from slavery

193
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,600
are both derived from the freedom of labor.

194
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,840
You can't work or enjoy the fruits of that work

195
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,680
if you're dead or your property.

196
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,220
As things became more complicated

197
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,380
and we realized that a legal system was necessary

198
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,800
to arbitrate between the many sets

199
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,580
of overlapping rights we all share,

200
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,220
we eventually realized that the functioning

201
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,600
of such a system required the right to a fair trial

202
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,760
and the right to legal counsel.

203
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,960
These are also derived rights, obviously,

204
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,280
and they're fundamentally necessary

205
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,040
because we're fallible creatures dealing

206
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,120
in concepts we still don't fully understand.

207
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,720
I mean, yeah, if you and I are talking

208
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,080
about being on an island,

209
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,220
we can probably map out our overlapping rights

210
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,200
and the resulting compromises pretty quickly.

211
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,580
But can we draw that out

212
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,360
for millions of people simultaneously?

213
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,080
Probably not, that's a huge job.

214
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,120
And it's one of the main reasons

215
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,720
that we even have a court system.

216
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,980
But let's get back to the original point of the video,

217
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,520
all of those relatively new inventions

218
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,020
people are calling rights.

219
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,140
Let's see if they actually are rights.

220
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,880
The most popular one was healthcare is a human right.

221
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,100
Well, it's certainly a human need and nobody denies that,

222
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,080
but does it meet the definition of a right?

223
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,740
Well, let's go back to the island.

224
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,960
Is it a natural right?

225
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,020
Obviously not.

226
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,760
Just like the natural world doesn't plop a fish

227
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,580
into your lap just because you're hungry,

228
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,040
it's also not gonna plop a first aid kit there either.

229
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,440
Is it a derived right,

230
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,640
born out of the interactions between people?

231
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,840
Well, maybe.

232
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,640
But remember, when multiple people are involved,

233
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,560
your rights are everybody else's responsibility.

234
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,640
But remember, when multiple people are involved,

235
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,320
your rights are everybody else's responsibility.

236
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,780
Speech is easy, just don't censor and you're fine.

237
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,080
Property rights are also pretty easy, just don't steal.

238
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,920
But how about a hypothetical right to being cared for?

239
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,320
Remember, this is not a right to go and get healthcare

240
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,200
because that would be a right to the fruits of your labor.

241
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,280
You work, you exchange your labor for healthcare

242
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,120
and you're good.

243
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,580
This is directly the right to healthcare.

244
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,080
That means everybody else has the responsibility

245
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,760
to bring healthcare to you,

246
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,520
regardless of and disconnected from your own labor.

247
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,300
On our little island community,

248
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,880
that might mean if one person is sick or injured,

249
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,760
the other nine people have a responsibility

250
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,600
to care for them.

251
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,540
Well, that seems fine so far.

252
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,940
But because it's their right

253
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,660
and your responsibility to fill it,

254
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,820
you can't have an expectation of compensation.

255
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,600
You don't get a reward for not censoring people.

256
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,500
It's something that you just have to do.

257
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,780
You don't get a reward for not stealing, same thing.

258
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,640
And if healthcare were a human right,

259
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,100
you don't get a reward for providing it.

260
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,800
It's just your responsibility,

261
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,280
one of the many you have to perform

262
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,540
in order to live with other people.

263
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,660
And this is where the objection

264
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,580
to making healthcare a human right comes from.

265
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,740
If healthcare is your human right,

266
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,660
then it's everybody else's responsibility to fulfill, period.

267
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,900
Now, if there's money in the budget

268
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,660
and the doctor can get paid by the state for your care,

269
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,500
then fine.

270
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,920
But if there's no more money, one of two things happens.

271
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,300
Either the government compels the doctor to care for you

272
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,420
under the threat of force,

273
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,300
because if he refuses to care for you,

274
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,620
your rights are violated by his inaction

275
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,480
regardless of his lack of compensation.

276
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,580
Or the healthcare system collapses

277
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,060
because it ends up becoming more profitable

278
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,020
for doctors to go off and labor elsewhere

279
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,140
under a different job.

280
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,500
Since that doctor not getting paid to care for you

281
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,000
still needs to get paid somehow.

282
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,580
In essence, the right to healthcare is incompatible

283
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,300
with the right to the fruit of your own labor.

284
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,780
Because when the chips are down, when the money's run out,

285
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,260
people working in the health services

286
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,340
are obligated to either work without reward or quit working.

287
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,660
Same with the right to housing.

288
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,260
Simply exchange doctor with carpenter, I guess,

289
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,500
and you've got the same argument.

290
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,180
If everybody's got the right to a house,

291
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,980
not to buy one or build one, but to have one,

292
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,220
then workers must labor under state compulsion

293
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,780
to provide them, because failing to do so

294
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,700
would be an abdication of their responsibility

295
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,560
and a violation of other people's rights.

296
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,820
This is again, a major failure of communism.

297
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,840
Communist states would use this justification

298
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,120
to compel people to work,

299
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,640
stating that the people had rights that needed fulfilling

300
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,200
and you had to fulfill them,

301
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,840
regardless of whether you wanted to or not.

302
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,120
People often say that abortion is a human right

303
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,480
and that's a giant can of worms

304
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,060
I'm not prepared to get into in this video.

305
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,080
But if for the sake of argument,

306
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,840
we accept that a woman has a right to seek an abortion,

307
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,640
that does not give her the right to compel

308
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,880
any individual doctor to give it to her.

309
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,600
She doesn't have the right to an abortion,

310
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,360
but the right to try and get one,

311
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,800
like any other right derived from labor.

312
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,360
And I say individual doctor

313
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,920
because that's what it's ultimately all about, individuals.

314
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,320
The healthcare system doesn't exist

315
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,160
beyond the individuals who make it up.

316
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,700
Races, nations, religions, organizations of all types,

317
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,600
they don't exist beyond the individuals within them.

318
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,080
We've only begun to create systems

319
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,800
that exist independently of individuals just recently

320
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,080
with self automated computers and things of that nature.

321
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,440
But we're a long way off before that's relevant.

322
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,680
All collectives are just individuals

323
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,620
and societies that recognize human rights do so

324
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,240
because we recognize that the individual

325
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,520
is the force that rejuvenates the collective.

326
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,160
Every person has the potential to create

327
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,000
or discover something

328
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,240
and bring it back to the collective for everyone to enjoy.

329
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,880
It's why every religious story is at some point

330
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,740
about a single person in the wilderness,

331
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,520
encountering the world itself

332
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,580
and then returning to the city with his new wisdom.

333
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,640
It's why all the most well loved narratives,

334
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,120
the shows, the movies, the books,

335
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,940
follow the hero's journey of childhood,

336
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,240
thrust into adventure, descent into darkness

337
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,400
and the victorious return to civilization.

338
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,560
Human rights are a reflection of that knowledge

339
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,000
that we've figured out the individual

340
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,680
is superordinate to the collective.

341
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,840
Despite the extreme importance of the collective,

342
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,120
because it's the individual

343
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,520
that keeps the collective alive,

344
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,460
every group that has squashed human rights

345
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,820
did so in the name of the collective.

346
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,700
Fascism does it in the name of the state,

347
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,320
Nazism in the name of the race,

348
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,080
communism in the name of the people or the worker,

349
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,560
religions in the name of the believer

350
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,940
and they all inevitably collapse

351
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,040
because the reforming force

352
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,520
that would carry them into the future, the individual,

353
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,640
is crushed along with his rights.

354
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,040
A liberal society recognizes that my rights

355
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,120
are everybody else's responsibility to uphold

356
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,380
and is therefore quite strict

357
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,440
with what actually constitutes a right

358
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,880
so that nobody may have their own rights violated

359
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,520
by their new responsibilities.

360
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,800
The opportunity to go out and get healthcare

361
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,560
like any other labor is absolutely a right

362
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,720
but healthcare itself cannot be a right.

363
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,020
That doesn't mean that I'm against the idea

364
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,440
of a national healthcare system.

365
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,520
I think it's good for people to not just die

366
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,280
because they can't afford the hospital stay

367
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,720
but it's still not a right

368
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,160
and just because you need it doesn't make it a right.

369
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,720
A healthcare service is a privilege

370
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,800
that a wealthy nation can provide its citizens

371
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,180
if and when the books are properly balanced.

372
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,680
It's not a human right

373
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,880
and forcing it to be one

374
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,080
will cause more problems than it will solve.
