00:00.000 --> 00:09.520
At this point, you probably know about the disaster that was my Rings of Power Watch

00:09.520 --> 00:11.560
Party video with Lilith and Archon Gibbs.

00:11.560 --> 00:13.960
I've been talking about it on stream for the past couple days.

00:13.960 --> 00:18.360
The quick tldr is, no matter how I censored it, it kept getting blocked, looking a little

00:18.360 --> 00:19.600
something like this.

00:19.600 --> 00:23.880
I finally managed to butcher it enough that it was viewable on YouTube, albeit demonetized.

00:23.880 --> 00:27.240
So if you feel like supporting the channel on Patreon, subscribe to our art, appreciate

00:27.240 --> 00:28.240
it.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.760
It's entirely uncensored on Bitchute, Odyssey, and Rumble.

00:30.760 --> 00:31.760
If you'd rather see it there.

00:31.760 --> 00:35.240
That's okay though, I'm going to keep doing them, at least until Rings of Power is done

00:35.240 --> 00:36.240
anyway.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.240
They're a lot of fun.

00:37.240 --> 00:38.240
Record Thursday Night Upload Friday?

00:38.240 --> 00:39.240
Why not?

00:39.240 --> 00:42.480
But floating around right now are the No Hate Watching memes, after it became known that

00:42.480 --> 00:46.560
Amazon is literally banking the future of Prime Video on the success of Rings of Power.

00:46.560 --> 00:49.880
And I understand that point of view, people are finally seeing a way to strike at the

00:49.880 --> 00:54.080
heart of some of the terminal woke rot in media, and it kind of feels like everyone's

00:54.080 --> 00:55.080
desperate for a win.

00:55.080 --> 00:59.380
But the cold hard truth is, No Hate Watching on its own isn't going to be what solves

00:59.380 --> 01:00.380
this problem.

01:00.380 --> 01:01.380
Consider Star Wars.

01:01.380 --> 01:03.880
The new trilogy sucked, but they still earned a ton of money.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.700
Less than they should have, yeah, but all three still turned a profit.

01:06.700 --> 01:10.520
And yet, despite that, Star Wars as a franchise is in shambles now.

01:10.520 --> 01:15.480
What was originally a small set of once-in-a-generation releases have become run-of-the-mill and easily

01:15.480 --> 01:16.480
ignorable.

01:16.480 --> 01:19.120
Part of this is the sheer amount of stuff being pumped out, for sure.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.600
Restricted quantity can serve to make something feel special.

01:21.600 --> 01:25.760
And part of it is definitely low quality, but part of it is also the reduced trust in

01:25.760 --> 01:27.040
the franchise.

01:27.040 --> 01:31.020
This is what I meant when I said, I think a year ago at this point, that Get Woke Go

01:31.020 --> 01:34.000
Broke is not a sophisticated enough analysis.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.440
Simply putting diversity hires into a property won't mean that it instantly tanks.

01:37.440 --> 01:38.840
In fact, it often doesn't.

01:38.840 --> 01:42.080
But sacrificing quality for politics does burn your audience.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.860
And once burned, they're far less likely to return again.

01:44.860 --> 01:49.540
This is a long-term failure, getting to the point that the Han Solo movie was a box office

01:49.540 --> 01:54.200
bomb, unheard of for Star Wars, is going to first take several other bad Star Wars

01:54.200 --> 01:56.620
films that nonetheless bring in the cash.

01:56.620 --> 01:59.940
In order to reduce franchise trust to the point that the company actually starts to

01:59.940 --> 02:03.960
take financial damage from the lack of interest, the point where no hate-watching is actually

02:03.960 --> 02:07.020
a viable tactic, the general public first has to get burned.

02:07.020 --> 02:08.860
They've got to stomach some god-awful shit.

02:08.860 --> 02:12.020
They've got to walk out of the theater thinking, that was a waste of my money, never doing

02:12.020 --> 02:13.020
that again.

02:13.020 --> 02:16.260
And that entails the studios making some money, at least in the short term.

02:16.300 --> 02:20.260
Unfortunately, we're not there yet with Prime Studios and the Rings of Power.

02:20.260 --> 02:22.480
Amazon is one of the biggest companies in human history.

02:22.480 --> 02:26.220
Over 200 million people have an Amazon Prime subscription across the planet.

02:26.220 --> 02:29.700
Not all of them watch Prime Video, obviously, but nonetheless, that's a huge base.

02:29.700 --> 02:31.940
If you decide not to watch the Rings of Power, that's fine.

02:31.940 --> 02:33.780
But Amazon doesn't care if they lose one viewer.

02:33.780 --> 02:37.420
What Amazon does care about, though, is the narrative surrounding the show.

02:37.420 --> 02:40.060
That is the lesson to be learned from the collapse of Star Wars.

02:40.060 --> 02:44.120
People leaving one-star reviews in IMDb, low Rotten Tomatoes scores, YouTubers talking

02:44.120 --> 02:45.860
shit about the latest film or episode.

02:45.860 --> 02:49.580
This is what led to Normies losing faith in Star Wars as a property.

02:49.580 --> 02:53.380
Even with the god-awful prequel trilogy, when you saw that Star Wars logo, you knew you

02:53.380 --> 02:57.700
were in for a fun afternoon filled with spaceships and laser sword fights and hero's journeys.

02:57.700 --> 02:58.980
But that trust is gone.

02:58.980 --> 03:02.380
Nobody thinks that way anymore when they see that another Star Wars thing is on the horizon.

03:02.380 --> 03:05.820
And it's because Disney lost the war over the narrative.

03:05.820 --> 03:09.440
What happened was, people who cared enough to write reviews or comment publicly did so.

03:09.440 --> 03:13.120
Not just YouTubers making videos or streams, like me and many others, but also people who

03:13.120 --> 03:17.080
decided to leave reviews in IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes or talk about it on social media.

03:17.080 --> 03:19.260
Those people who were willing to talk about their disappointment.

03:19.260 --> 03:21.200
And then, those who listened to them talk.

03:21.200 --> 03:25.260
That silent majority of people who watch videos or read reviews without ever commenting.

03:25.260 --> 03:26.840
Those people took the criticism with them.

03:26.840 --> 03:30.680
And then, those fans spoke to the Normies, the people who aren't online at all watching

03:30.680 --> 03:32.080
YouTubers or reading reviews.

03:32.080 --> 03:35.880
In between classes at school or around the water cooler at work, Normies would ask, what's

03:35.880 --> 03:37.240
that new Star Wars thing like?

03:37.240 --> 03:40.400
And people like you told them, don't waste your time, it's garbage.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.860
The Normie then thought, oh yeah, the last one I saw was also shit, wasn't it?

03:43.860 --> 03:45.820
And then that became the prevailing narrative.

03:45.820 --> 03:49.580
That is the true power we have, not to boycott, though boycotts absolutely have their place

03:49.580 --> 03:50.580
in a consumer revolt.

03:50.580 --> 03:54.320
But we have the power to set the cultural narrative through critiquing the thing itself

03:54.320 --> 03:56.100
and making that critique known to others.

03:56.100 --> 04:00.800
And Amazon did take note of that lesson that Disney learned the hard way with Star Wars.

04:00.800 --> 04:04.720
After we recorded that watch party of Rings of Power, Cibs tried to write a negative review

04:04.720 --> 04:08.880
on Prime Video itself, only to watch in real time as his review was deleted.

04:08.880 --> 04:13.700
I also took these screenshots from him, thanks pal, of how on other movies or shows, Amazon

04:13.700 --> 04:17.580
is fine with displaying the average review score, but not on Rings of Power.

04:17.580 --> 04:20.480
Instead it just says top 10 number one in the US.

04:20.480 --> 04:24.160
Amazon owns IMDB too, so it's no surprise they've suppressed negative reviews there.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.340
The average score is 6.6 out of 10.

04:26.340 --> 04:28.440
And you can see that there's a lot of tens and a lot of ones.

04:28.440 --> 04:31.680
If you go to the reviews themselves, you'll find that all the ones are missing.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.160
You can read the positive reviews, sure.

04:33.160 --> 04:37.400
But if you choose to filter for only the one star reviews, suddenly there's nothing there

04:37.400 --> 04:38.400
to display.

04:38.920 --> 04:42.680
This is purposely blocking people from reading any review lower than a 6 out of 10 for the

04:42.680 --> 04:43.680
Rings of Power.

04:43.680 --> 04:46.320
And it's not like this is a secret that they're trying to keep covered up.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.720
Amazon is deploying its own anti-troll weapons to protect the Rings of Power.

04:49.720 --> 04:53.920
Prime Video has instituted a 72 hour review delay to screen out the most vocal and potentially

04:53.920 --> 04:56.300
bad faith critics of its Lord of the Rings show.

04:56.300 --> 04:59.040
Of course, anyone who just likes the show is a troll.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.320
We all saw this coming, right?

05:00.320 --> 05:03.640
When we saw the original first look of Rings of Power back at the start of the year, and

05:03.640 --> 05:07.320
it looked awful, and we learned that Amazon had a billion dollar price tag attached to

05:07.320 --> 05:08.320
it.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.600
We all went on straight, already predicted what was going to happen.

05:10.600 --> 05:11.920
We all knew that it would suck.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.720
We all knew that they would suppress reviews.

05:13.720 --> 05:17.520
And we all knew that their justification for the suppression of reviews would be that those

05:17.520 --> 05:20.960
bad reviews were written by trolls, or even worse, by racists.

05:20.960 --> 05:24.980
All of the true fans would love the show, but all the critics wouldn't be true fans.

05:24.980 --> 05:29.160
But reactionary, gamergate, manbaby, racist, trolling Russian bots.

05:29.160 --> 05:32.300
It's been like this since 2016, you should know the score by now.

05:32.300 --> 05:36.120
As a quick aside, it's pretty funny just how poorly Amazon treated what they consider

05:36.120 --> 05:39.180
to be the actual fans, the people they invited to their prescreening.

05:39.180 --> 05:41.440
The premiere in London has been a disappointment.

05:41.440 --> 05:42.520
Anyone sad they can't make it?

05:42.520 --> 05:43.520
You're missing nothing.

05:43.520 --> 05:47.560
We're crammed into cramped pens, being asked to cheer on cue, with no speakers so we can't

05:47.560 --> 05:49.180
hear the audio and no idea what's happening.

05:49.180 --> 05:52.740
We can barely hear anyone, and it's hot, and no water's been handed out.

05:52.740 --> 05:55.160
We aren't allowed to leave or won't be able to watch the screening.

05:55.160 --> 05:58.300
Several people have just sat down near the back of our pen where the cameras can't

05:58.300 --> 05:59.300
see them.

05:59.300 --> 06:01.080
We've been trapped here for two and a half hours now.

06:01.080 --> 06:02.080
It's starting to rain.

06:02.080 --> 06:05.040
Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful to get to see the first two episodes a few days

06:05.040 --> 06:07.920
earlier on IMAX Cinema, but this premiere has been an absolute shitshow.

06:07.920 --> 06:11.920
Anyone else in Fan Pen 4, I love you, you will all survive, I believe in us.

06:11.920 --> 06:12.920
Here's another one.

06:12.920 --> 06:16.560
After winning two tickets to the world premiere, I expected to go to a red carpet event, see

06:16.560 --> 06:19.940
the cast, and get to share a large room with the creators behind the show.

06:19.940 --> 06:23.480
In reality, I was used as a human prop, made to stand and cheer on people I didn't know,

06:23.480 --> 06:27.900
without being able to hear a word they were saying, for three damn hours, with no seats.

06:27.900 --> 06:30.500
Then going into a screen with only fellow competition winners.

06:30.500 --> 06:33.180
There was a pointless applause at the end, as there was nobody that worked on the show

06:33.180 --> 06:34.600
there to hear the applause.

06:34.600 --> 06:35.800
Jesus.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.320
Imagine whoring yourself out to Amazon, only to be treated like this, in the service of

06:39.320 --> 06:41.240
probably one of the worst shows to come out this year.

06:41.240 --> 06:43.560
At least if you're an actual whore, you get laid.

06:43.560 --> 06:46.040
Rotten Tomatoes scores look to still be about accurate.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.940
High critics score, low audience score.

06:47.940 --> 06:50.080
Exactly what you'd expect when Amazon pushes out a third.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.520
The corpos flock to it, and the average Joe rejects it.

06:52.520 --> 06:53.520
But not all corpos.

06:53.520 --> 06:57.340
The show is enough of an insult to the Lord of the Rings, that more mainstream publications

06:57.340 --> 06:59.040
are also posting criticisms of it.

06:59.040 --> 07:02.560
In fact, Jeff Bezos' son asked his dad to ensure that the Rings of Power wasn't a

07:02.560 --> 07:05.520
disaster, and he sent the showrunners his notes, only to be ignored.

07:05.520 --> 07:08.680
The people involved in the making of the show, on the ground, have no problem confirming

07:08.680 --> 07:12.560
that it is indeed about identity politics, saying we're telling the story now.

07:12.560 --> 07:15.700
Meanwhile, Peter Jackson was ignored, in order to push this new vision.

07:15.700 --> 07:19.480
Like I said before, this series of events should sound familiar to anybody who's paid

07:19.480 --> 07:20.760
attention for the past decade.

07:20.760 --> 07:23.080
In any case, if you want a hate watch, go right ahead.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.600
Fire up your current favorite torrent application and give it a go.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.480
Not giving Amazon money won't affect them, but it's better than giving them money, that's

07:28.480 --> 07:29.480
for sure.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.420
But what really matters, is that you leave accurate, negative reviews.

07:32.420 --> 07:35.620
They can't be inaccurate, because then the simps and the corpos can dismiss you out of

07:35.620 --> 07:37.420
hand for not knowing what you're talking about.

07:37.420 --> 07:38.420
Then you actually are a troll.

07:38.420 --> 07:42.180
But if you have coherent arguments, then you can't be ignored, and it's far more important

07:42.180 --> 07:46.280
that your voice reaches the normies, who don't know anything about any of this terminally

07:46.280 --> 07:47.900
online woke nonsense.

07:47.900 --> 07:52.260
There's a lot more at stake here than just the Rings of Power as a single TV show.

07:52.260 --> 07:56.260
Amazon wants to use this as a springboard to turn the Lord of the Rings into a perpetually

07:56.260 --> 08:00.700
producing franchise, like Star Wars or the MCU, at the expense of the quality of the

08:00.700 --> 08:01.820
Thing or its fans.

08:01.820 --> 08:04.560
They don't care about the artistry of it, they care about the franchising.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.780
This is the moment where we want to wreck the reputation of the new series, right when

08:07.780 --> 08:08.780
it's just starting to take off.

08:08.780 --> 08:13.620
If the show is bad, and it is, that needs to be the eternal albatross around the franchise's

08:13.620 --> 08:14.620
neck.

08:14.620 --> 08:17.940
Currently, every time a normie thinks Lord of the Rings, they think of the Peter Jackson

08:17.940 --> 08:18.940
films.

08:18.940 --> 08:21.920
They remember having a good time, and so they're willing to give the Rings of Power a shot.

08:21.920 --> 08:24.020
That's an impulse that we need to work against.

08:24.020 --> 08:26.120
Amazon knows all of this, it's why they're trying to suppress it.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.700
Hiding negative reviews for 72 hours isn't coincidental.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.460
The show came out last Thursday.

08:30.460 --> 08:33.840
If your normie co-worker or friend hears that there's a new Lord of the Rings out, they've

08:33.840 --> 08:36.060
probably already checked it out over the course of the weekend.

08:36.060 --> 08:39.580
By the time this video comes out, on Monday, it's already too late for episodes 1 and 2.

08:39.580 --> 08:42.220
So what we need to do is set the narrative around this show.

08:42.220 --> 08:45.820
If in five years time, the Rings of Power is talked about the same way that Star Wars

08:45.820 --> 08:49.380
episodes 7 to 9 are talked about right now, then we will have done our jobs.

08:49.380 --> 08:50.420
So let's get to it.
