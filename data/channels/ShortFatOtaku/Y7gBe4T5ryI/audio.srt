1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,520
At this point, you probably know about the disaster that was my Rings of Power Watch

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,560
Party video with Lilith and Archon Gibbs.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,960
I've been talking about it on stream for the past couple days.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,360
The quick tldr is, no matter how I censored it, it kept getting blocked, looking a little

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,600
something like this.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,880
I finally managed to butcher it enough that it was viewable on YouTube, albeit demonetized.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,240
So if you feel like supporting the channel on Patreon, subscribe to our art, appreciate

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,240
it.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,760
It's entirely uncensored on Bitchute, Odyssey, and Rumble.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,760
If you'd rather see it there.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,240
That's okay though, I'm going to keep doing them, at least until Rings of Power is done

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
anyway.

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,240
They're a lot of fun.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,240
Record Thursday Night Upload Friday?

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,240
Why not?

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,480
But floating around right now are the No Hate Watching memes, after it became known that

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,560
Amazon is literally banking the future of Prime Video on the success of Rings of Power.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,880
And I understand that point of view, people are finally seeing a way to strike at the

19
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,080
heart of some of the terminal woke rot in media, and it kind of feels like everyone's

20
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,080
desperate for a win.

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,380
But the cold hard truth is, No Hate Watching on its own isn't going to be what solves

22
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,380
this problem.

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,380
Consider Star Wars.

24
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,880
The new trilogy sucked, but they still earned a ton of money.

25
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,700
Less than they should have, yeah, but all three still turned a profit.

26
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,520
And yet, despite that, Star Wars as a franchise is in shambles now.

27
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,480
What was originally a small set of once-in-a-generation releases have become run-of-the-mill and easily

28
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
ignorable.

29
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,120
Part of this is the sheer amount of stuff being pumped out, for sure.

30
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,600
Restricted quantity can serve to make something feel special.

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,760
And part of it is definitely low quality, but part of it is also the reduced trust in

32
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,040
the franchise.

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,020
This is what I meant when I said, I think a year ago at this point, that Get Woke Go

34
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,000
Broke is not a sophisticated enough analysis.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,440
Simply putting diversity hires into a property won't mean that it instantly tanks.

36
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,840
In fact, it often doesn't.

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,080
But sacrificing quality for politics does burn your audience.

38
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,860
And once burned, they're far less likely to return again.

39
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,540
This is a long-term failure, getting to the point that the Han Solo movie was a box office

40
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,200
bomb, unheard of for Star Wars, is going to first take several other bad Star Wars

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,620
films that nonetheless bring in the cash.

42
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,940
In order to reduce franchise trust to the point that the company actually starts to

43
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,960
take financial damage from the lack of interest, the point where no hate-watching is actually

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,020
a viable tactic, the general public first has to get burned.

45
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,860
They've got to stomach some god-awful shit.

46
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,020
They've got to walk out of the theater thinking, that was a waste of my money, never doing

47
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,020
that again.

48
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,260
And that entails the studios making some money, at least in the short term.

49
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,260
Unfortunately, we're not there yet with Prime Studios and the Rings of Power.

50
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,480
Amazon is one of the biggest companies in human history.

51
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,220
Over 200 million people have an Amazon Prime subscription across the planet.

52
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,700
Not all of them watch Prime Video, obviously, but nonetheless, that's a huge base.

53
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,940
If you decide not to watch the Rings of Power, that's fine.

54
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,780
But Amazon doesn't care if they lose one viewer.

55
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,420
What Amazon does care about, though, is the narrative surrounding the show.

56
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,060
That is the lesson to be learned from the collapse of Star Wars.

57
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,120
People leaving one-star reviews in IMDb, low Rotten Tomatoes scores, YouTubers talking

58
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,860
shit about the latest film or episode.

59
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,580
This is what led to Normies losing faith in Star Wars as a property.

60
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,380
Even with the god-awful prequel trilogy, when you saw that Star Wars logo, you knew you

61
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,700
were in for a fun afternoon filled with spaceships and laser sword fights and hero's journeys.

62
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,980
But that trust is gone.

63
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,380
Nobody thinks that way anymore when they see that another Star Wars thing is on the horizon.

64
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,820
And it's because Disney lost the war over the narrative.

65
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,440
What happened was, people who cared enough to write reviews or comment publicly did so.

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,120
Not just YouTubers making videos or streams, like me and many others, but also people who

67
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,080
decided to leave reviews in IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes or talk about it on social media.

68
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,260
Those people who were willing to talk about their disappointment.

69
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,200
And then, those who listened to them talk.

70
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,260
That silent majority of people who watch videos or read reviews without ever commenting.

71
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,840
Those people took the criticism with them.

72
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,680
And then, those fans spoke to the Normies, the people who aren't online at all watching

73
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,080
YouTubers or reading reviews.

74
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,880
In between classes at school or around the water cooler at work, Normies would ask, what's

75
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,240
that new Star Wars thing like?

76
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,400
And people like you told them, don't waste your time, it's garbage.

77
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,860
The Normie then thought, oh yeah, the last one I saw was also shit, wasn't it?

78
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,820
And then that became the prevailing narrative.

79
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,580
That is the true power we have, not to boycott, though boycotts absolutely have their place

80
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,580
in a consumer revolt.

81
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,320
But we have the power to set the cultural narrative through critiquing the thing itself

82
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,100
and making that critique known to others.

83
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,800
And Amazon did take note of that lesson that Disney learned the hard way with Star Wars.

84
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,720
After we recorded that watch party of Rings of Power, Cibs tried to write a negative review

85
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,880
on Prime Video itself, only to watch in real time as his review was deleted.

86
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,700
I also took these screenshots from him, thanks pal, of how on other movies or shows, Amazon

87
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,580
is fine with displaying the average review score, but not on Rings of Power.

88
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,480
Instead it just says top 10 number one in the US.

89
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,160
Amazon owns IMDB too, so it's no surprise they've suppressed negative reviews there.

90
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,340
The average score is 6.6 out of 10.

91
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,440
And you can see that there's a lot of tens and a lot of ones.

92
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,680
If you go to the reviews themselves, you'll find that all the ones are missing.

93
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,160
You can read the positive reviews, sure.

94
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,400
But if you choose to filter for only the one star reviews, suddenly there's nothing there

95
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
to display.

96
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,680
This is purposely blocking people from reading any review lower than a 6 out of 10 for the

97
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
Rings of Power.

98
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,320
And it's not like this is a secret that they're trying to keep covered up.

99
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,720
Amazon is deploying its own anti-troll weapons to protect the Rings of Power.

100
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,920
Prime Video has instituted a 72 hour review delay to screen out the most vocal and potentially

101
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,300
bad faith critics of its Lord of the Rings show.

102
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,040
Of course, anyone who just likes the show is a troll.

103
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,320
We all saw this coming, right?

104
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,640
When we saw the original first look of Rings of Power back at the start of the year, and

105
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,320
it looked awful, and we learned that Amazon had a billion dollar price tag attached to

106
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,320
it.

107
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,600
We all went on straight, already predicted what was going to happen.

108
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,920
We all knew that it would suck.

109
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,720
We all knew that they would suppress reviews.

110
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,520
And we all knew that their justification for the suppression of reviews would be that those

111
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,960
bad reviews were written by trolls, or even worse, by racists.

112
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,980
All of the true fans would love the show, but all the critics wouldn't be true fans.

113
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,160
But reactionary, gamergate, manbaby, racist, trolling Russian bots.

114
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,300
It's been like this since 2016, you should know the score by now.

115
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,120
As a quick aside, it's pretty funny just how poorly Amazon treated what they consider

116
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,180
to be the actual fans, the people they invited to their prescreening.

117
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,440
The premiere in London has been a disappointment.

118
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,520
Anyone sad they can't make it?

119
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,520
You're missing nothing.

120
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,560
We're crammed into cramped pens, being asked to cheer on cue, with no speakers so we can't

121
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,180
hear the audio and no idea what's happening.

122
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,740
We can barely hear anyone, and it's hot, and no water's been handed out.

123
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,160
We aren't allowed to leave or won't be able to watch the screening.

124
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,300
Several people have just sat down near the back of our pen where the cameras can't

125
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,300
see them.

126
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,080
We've been trapped here for two and a half hours now.

127
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
It's starting to rain.

128
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,040
Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful to get to see the first two episodes a few days

129
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,920
earlier on IMAX Cinema, but this premiere has been an absolute shitshow.

130
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Anyone else in Fan Pen 4, I love you, you will all survive, I believe in us.

131
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
Here's another one.

132
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,560
After winning two tickets to the world premiere, I expected to go to a red carpet event, see

133
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,940
the cast, and get to share a large room with the creators behind the show.

134
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,480
In reality, I was used as a human prop, made to stand and cheer on people I didn't know,

135
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,900
without being able to hear a word they were saying, for three damn hours, with no seats.

136
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,500
Then going into a screen with only fellow competition winners.

137
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,180
There was a pointless applause at the end, as there was nobody that worked on the show

138
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,600
there to hear the applause.

139
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,800
Jesus.

140
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,320
Imagine whoring yourself out to Amazon, only to be treated like this, in the service of

141
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,240
probably one of the worst shows to come out this year.

142
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,560
At least if you're an actual whore, you get laid.

143
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,040
Rotten Tomatoes scores look to still be about accurate.

144
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,940
High critics score, low audience score.

145
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,080
Exactly what you'd expect when Amazon pushes out a third.

146
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,520
The corpos flock to it, and the average Joe rejects it.

147
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,520
But not all corpos.

148
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,340
The show is enough of an insult to the Lord of the Rings, that more mainstream publications

149
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,040
are also posting criticisms of it.

150
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,560
In fact, Jeff Bezos' son asked his dad to ensure that the Rings of Power wasn't a

151
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,520
disaster, and he sent the showrunners his notes, only to be ignored.

152
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,680
The people involved in the making of the show, on the ground, have no problem confirming

153
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,560
that it is indeed about identity politics, saying we're telling the story now.

154
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,700
Meanwhile, Peter Jackson was ignored, in order to push this new vision.

155
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,480
Like I said before, this series of events should sound familiar to anybody who's paid

156
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,760
attention for the past decade.

157
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,080
In any case, if you want a hate watch, go right ahead.

158
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,600
Fire up your current favorite torrent application and give it a go.

159
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,480
Not giving Amazon money won't affect them, but it's better than giving them money, that's

160
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
for sure.

161
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,420
But what really matters, is that you leave accurate, negative reviews.

162
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,620
They can't be inaccurate, because then the simps and the corpos can dismiss you out of

163
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,420
hand for not knowing what you're talking about.

164
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,420
Then you actually are a troll.

165
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,180
But if you have coherent arguments, then you can't be ignored, and it's far more important

166
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,280
that your voice reaches the normies, who don't know anything about any of this terminally

167
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,900
online woke nonsense.

168
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,260
There's a lot more at stake here than just the Rings of Power as a single TV show.

169
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,260
Amazon wants to use this as a springboard to turn the Lord of the Rings into a perpetually

170
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,700
producing franchise, like Star Wars or the MCU, at the expense of the quality of the

171
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,820
Thing or its fans.

172
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,560
They don't care about the artistry of it, they care about the franchising.

173
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,780
This is the moment where we want to wreck the reputation of the new series, right when

174
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,780
it's just starting to take off.

175
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,620
If the show is bad, and it is, that needs to be the eternal albatross around the franchise's

176
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,620
neck.

177
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,940
Currently, every time a normie thinks Lord of the Rings, they think of the Peter Jackson

178
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,940
films.

179
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,920
They remember having a good time, and so they're willing to give the Rings of Power a shot.

180
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,020
That's an impulse that we need to work against.

181
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,120
Amazon knows all of this, it's why they're trying to suppress it.

182
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,700
Hiding negative reviews for 72 hours isn't coincidental.

183
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,460
The show came out last Thursday.

184
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,840
If your normie co-worker or friend hears that there's a new Lord of the Rings out, they've

185
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,060
probably already checked it out over the course of the weekend.

186
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,580
By the time this video comes out, on Monday, it's already too late for episodes 1 and 2.

187
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,220
So what we need to do is set the narrative around this show.

188
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,820
If in five years time, the Rings of Power is talked about the same way that Star Wars

189
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,380
episodes 7 to 9 are talked about right now, then we will have done our jobs.

190
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,420
So let's get to it.
