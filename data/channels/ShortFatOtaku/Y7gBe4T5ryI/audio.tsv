0	9520	At this point, you probably know about the disaster that was my Rings of Power Watch
9520	11560	Party video with Lilith and Archon Gibbs.
11560	13960	I've been talking about it on stream for the past couple days.
13960	18360	The quick tldr is, no matter how I censored it, it kept getting blocked, looking a little
18360	19600	something like this.
19600	23880	I finally managed to butcher it enough that it was viewable on YouTube, albeit demonetized.
23880	27240	So if you feel like supporting the channel on Patreon, subscribe to our art, appreciate
27240	28240	it.
28240	30760	It's entirely uncensored on Bitchute, Odyssey, and Rumble.
30760	31760	If you'd rather see it there.
31760	35240	That's okay though, I'm going to keep doing them, at least until Rings of Power is done
35240	36240	anyway.
36240	37240	They're a lot of fun.
37240	38240	Record Thursday Night Upload Friday?
38240	39240	Why not?
39240	42480	But floating around right now are the No Hate Watching memes, after it became known that
42480	46560	Amazon is literally banking the future of Prime Video on the success of Rings of Power.
46560	49880	And I understand that point of view, people are finally seeing a way to strike at the
49880	54080	heart of some of the terminal woke rot in media, and it kind of feels like everyone's
54080	55080	desperate for a win.
55080	59380	But the cold hard truth is, No Hate Watching on its own isn't going to be what solves
59380	60380	this problem.
60380	61380	Consider Star Wars.
61380	63880	The new trilogy sucked, but they still earned a ton of money.
63880	66700	Less than they should have, yeah, but all three still turned a profit.
66700	70520	And yet, despite that, Star Wars as a franchise is in shambles now.
70520	75480	What was originally a small set of once-in-a-generation releases have become run-of-the-mill and easily
75480	76480	ignorable.
76480	79120	Part of this is the sheer amount of stuff being pumped out, for sure.
79120	81600	Restricted quantity can serve to make something feel special.
81600	85760	And part of it is definitely low quality, but part of it is also the reduced trust in
85760	87040	the franchise.
87040	91020	This is what I meant when I said, I think a year ago at this point, that Get Woke Go
91020	94000	Broke is not a sophisticated enough analysis.
94000	97440	Simply putting diversity hires into a property won't mean that it instantly tanks.
97440	98840	In fact, it often doesn't.
98840	102080	But sacrificing quality for politics does burn your audience.
102080	104860	And once burned, they're far less likely to return again.
104860	109540	This is a long-term failure, getting to the point that the Han Solo movie was a box office
109540	114200	bomb, unheard of for Star Wars, is going to first take several other bad Star Wars
114200	116620	films that nonetheless bring in the cash.
116620	119940	In order to reduce franchise trust to the point that the company actually starts to
119940	123960	take financial damage from the lack of interest, the point where no hate-watching is actually
123960	127020	a viable tactic, the general public first has to get burned.
127020	128860	They've got to stomach some god-awful shit.
128860	132020	They've got to walk out of the theater thinking, that was a waste of my money, never doing
132020	133020	that again.
133020	136260	And that entails the studios making some money, at least in the short term.
136300	140260	Unfortunately, we're not there yet with Prime Studios and the Rings of Power.
140260	142480	Amazon is one of the biggest companies in human history.
142480	146220	Over 200 million people have an Amazon Prime subscription across the planet.
146220	149700	Not all of them watch Prime Video, obviously, but nonetheless, that's a huge base.
149700	151940	If you decide not to watch the Rings of Power, that's fine.
151940	153780	But Amazon doesn't care if they lose one viewer.
153780	157420	What Amazon does care about, though, is the narrative surrounding the show.
157420	160060	That is the lesson to be learned from the collapse of Star Wars.
160060	164120	People leaving one-star reviews in IMDb, low Rotten Tomatoes scores, YouTubers talking
164120	165860	shit about the latest film or episode.
165860	169580	This is what led to Normies losing faith in Star Wars as a property.
169580	173380	Even with the god-awful prequel trilogy, when you saw that Star Wars logo, you knew you
173380	177700	were in for a fun afternoon filled with spaceships and laser sword fights and hero's journeys.
177700	178980	But that trust is gone.
178980	182380	Nobody thinks that way anymore when they see that another Star Wars thing is on the horizon.
182380	185820	And it's because Disney lost the war over the narrative.
185820	189440	What happened was, people who cared enough to write reviews or comment publicly did so.
189440	193120	Not just YouTubers making videos or streams, like me and many others, but also people who
193120	197080	decided to leave reviews in IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes or talk about it on social media.
197080	199260	Those people who were willing to talk about their disappointment.
199260	201200	And then, those who listened to them talk.
201200	205260	That silent majority of people who watch videos or read reviews without ever commenting.
205260	206840	Those people took the criticism with them.
206840	210680	And then, those fans spoke to the Normies, the people who aren't online at all watching
210680	212080	YouTubers or reading reviews.
212080	215880	In between classes at school or around the water cooler at work, Normies would ask, what's
215880	217240	that new Star Wars thing like?
217240	220400	And people like you told them, don't waste your time, it's garbage.
220400	223860	The Normie then thought, oh yeah, the last one I saw was also shit, wasn't it?
223860	225820	And then that became the prevailing narrative.
225820	229580	That is the true power we have, not to boycott, though boycotts absolutely have their place
229580	230580	in a consumer revolt.
230580	234320	But we have the power to set the cultural narrative through critiquing the thing itself
234320	236100	and making that critique known to others.
236100	240800	And Amazon did take note of that lesson that Disney learned the hard way with Star Wars.
240800	244720	After we recorded that watch party of Rings of Power, Cibs tried to write a negative review
244720	248880	on Prime Video itself, only to watch in real time as his review was deleted.
248880	253700	I also took these screenshots from him, thanks pal, of how on other movies or shows, Amazon
253700	257580	is fine with displaying the average review score, but not on Rings of Power.
257580	260480	Instead it just says top 10 number one in the US.
260480	264160	Amazon owns IMDB too, so it's no surprise they've suppressed negative reviews there.
264160	266340	The average score is 6.6 out of 10.
266340	268440	And you can see that there's a lot of tens and a lot of ones.
268440	271680	If you go to the reviews themselves, you'll find that all the ones are missing.
271680	273160	You can read the positive reviews, sure.
273160	277400	But if you choose to filter for only the one star reviews, suddenly there's nothing there
277400	278400	to display.
278920	282680	This is purposely blocking people from reading any review lower than a 6 out of 10 for the
282680	283680	Rings of Power.
283680	286320	And it's not like this is a secret that they're trying to keep covered up.
286320	289720	Amazon is deploying its own anti-troll weapons to protect the Rings of Power.
289720	293920	Prime Video has instituted a 72 hour review delay to screen out the most vocal and potentially
293920	296300	bad faith critics of its Lord of the Rings show.
296300	299040	Of course, anyone who just likes the show is a troll.
299040	300320	We all saw this coming, right?
300320	303640	When we saw the original first look of Rings of Power back at the start of the year, and
303640	307320	it looked awful, and we learned that Amazon had a billion dollar price tag attached to
307320	308320	it.
309240	310600	We all went on straight, already predicted what was going to happen.
310600	311920	We all knew that it would suck.
311920	313720	We all knew that they would suppress reviews.
313720	317520	And we all knew that their justification for the suppression of reviews would be that those
317520	320960	bad reviews were written by trolls, or even worse, by racists.
320960	324980	All of the true fans would love the show, but all the critics wouldn't be true fans.
324980	329160	But reactionary, gamergate, manbaby, racist, trolling Russian bots.
329160	332300	It's been like this since 2016, you should know the score by now.
332300	336120	As a quick aside, it's pretty funny just how poorly Amazon treated what they consider
336120	339180	to be the actual fans, the people they invited to their prescreening.
339180	341440	The premiere in London has been a disappointment.
341440	342520	Anyone sad they can't make it?
342520	343520	You're missing nothing.
343520	347560	We're crammed into cramped pens, being asked to cheer on cue, with no speakers so we can't
347560	349180	hear the audio and no idea what's happening.
349180	352740	We can barely hear anyone, and it's hot, and no water's been handed out.
352740	355160	We aren't allowed to leave or won't be able to watch the screening.
355160	358300	Several people have just sat down near the back of our pen where the cameras can't
358300	359300	see them.
359300	361080	We've been trapped here for two and a half hours now.
361080	362080	It's starting to rain.
362080	365040	Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful to get to see the first two episodes a few days
365040	367920	earlier on IMAX Cinema, but this premiere has been an absolute shitshow.
367920	371920	Anyone else in Fan Pen 4, I love you, you will all survive, I believe in us.
371920	372920	Here's another one.
372920	376560	After winning two tickets to the world premiere, I expected to go to a red carpet event, see
376560	379940	the cast, and get to share a large room with the creators behind the show.
379940	383480	In reality, I was used as a human prop, made to stand and cheer on people I didn't know,
383480	387900	without being able to hear a word they were saying, for three damn hours, with no seats.
387900	390500	Then going into a screen with only fellow competition winners.
390500	393180	There was a pointless applause at the end, as there was nobody that worked on the show
393180	394600	there to hear the applause.
394600	395800	Jesus.
395800	399320	Imagine whoring yourself out to Amazon, only to be treated like this, in the service of
399320	401240	probably one of the worst shows to come out this year.
401240	403560	At least if you're an actual whore, you get laid.
403560	406040	Rotten Tomatoes scores look to still be about accurate.
406040	407940	High critics score, low audience score.
407940	410080	Exactly what you'd expect when Amazon pushes out a third.
410080	412520	The corpos flock to it, and the average Joe rejects it.
412520	413520	But not all corpos.
413520	417340	The show is enough of an insult to the Lord of the Rings, that more mainstream publications
417340	419040	are also posting criticisms of it.
419040	422560	In fact, Jeff Bezos' son asked his dad to ensure that the Rings of Power wasn't a
422560	425520	disaster, and he sent the showrunners his notes, only to be ignored.
425520	428680	The people involved in the making of the show, on the ground, have no problem confirming
428680	432560	that it is indeed about identity politics, saying we're telling the story now.
432560	435700	Meanwhile, Peter Jackson was ignored, in order to push this new vision.
435700	439480	Like I said before, this series of events should sound familiar to anybody who's paid
439480	440760	attention for the past decade.
440760	443080	In any case, if you want a hate watch, go right ahead.
443080	445600	Fire up your current favorite torrent application and give it a go.
445600	448480	Not giving Amazon money won't affect them, but it's better than giving them money, that's
448480	449480	for sure.
449480	452420	But what really matters, is that you leave accurate, negative reviews.
452420	455620	They can't be inaccurate, because then the simps and the corpos can dismiss you out of
455620	457420	hand for not knowing what you're talking about.
457420	458420	Then you actually are a troll.
458420	462180	But if you have coherent arguments, then you can't be ignored, and it's far more important
462180	466280	that your voice reaches the normies, who don't know anything about any of this terminally
466280	467900	online woke nonsense.
467900	472260	There's a lot more at stake here than just the Rings of Power as a single TV show.
472260	476260	Amazon wants to use this as a springboard to turn the Lord of the Rings into a perpetually
476260	480700	producing franchise, like Star Wars or the MCU, at the expense of the quality of the
480700	481820	Thing or its fans.
481820	484560	They don't care about the artistry of it, they care about the franchising.
484560	487780	This is the moment where we want to wreck the reputation of the new series, right when
487780	488780	it's just starting to take off.
488780	493620	If the show is bad, and it is, that needs to be the eternal albatross around the franchise's
493620	494620	neck.
494620	497940	Currently, every time a normie thinks Lord of the Rings, they think of the Peter Jackson
497940	498940	films.
498940	501920	They remember having a good time, and so they're willing to give the Rings of Power a shot.
501920	504020	That's an impulse that we need to work against.
504020	506120	Amazon knows all of this, it's why they're trying to suppress it.
506120	508700	Hiding negative reviews for 72 hours isn't coincidental.
508700	510460	The show came out last Thursday.
510460	513840	If your normie co-worker or friend hears that there's a new Lord of the Rings out, they've
513840	516060	probably already checked it out over the course of the weekend.
516060	519580	By the time this video comes out, on Monday, it's already too late for episodes 1 and 2.
519580	522220	So what we need to do is set the narrative around this show.
522220	525820	If in five years time, the Rings of Power is talked about the same way that Star Wars
525820	529380	episodes 7 to 9 are talked about right now, then we will have done our jobs.
529380	530420	So let's get to it.
