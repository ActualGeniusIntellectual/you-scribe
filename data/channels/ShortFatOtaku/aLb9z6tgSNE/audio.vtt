WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.720
Yes, I know this is not the Chaz video, but unironically I do have it on the way.

00:05.720 --> 00:09.280
It is in the pipeline, it's in the render queue as Spoonie would say.

00:09.280 --> 00:11.920
No really, check my editing drive.

00:11.920 --> 00:18.080
Here's two hours of raw commentary and another ten minutes of addendums once some new stories

00:18.080 --> 00:19.240
came out about it.

00:19.240 --> 00:24.120
The only thing I'm waiting on now is to see if any of those arrests from yesterday materialize

00:24.120 --> 00:25.280
into a news story.

00:25.280 --> 00:29.280
I'll tack that onto the video and then I'll release it, so you'll probably see it Monday

00:29.280 --> 00:30.880
or Tuesday or something.

00:30.880 --> 00:34.040
Sorry it's taken this long, but really, I am working on it.

00:34.040 --> 00:38.520
But I'm doing this video because I've realized something.

00:38.520 --> 00:43.800
Over the past dozen, maybe twenty videos or so that I've done on this channel, I've noticed

00:43.800 --> 00:45.000
a trend.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.160
And the trend basically amounts to the fact that I'm getting old.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.680
I'm referencing past political paradigms.

00:51.680 --> 00:56.780
I'm talking about the 2012 or 2008 elections as if they're at least somewhat new.

00:56.780 --> 01:01.280
I'm still disappointed that the left is not the left of the 90s, the left that I was a

01:01.280 --> 01:02.280
part of.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.620
I am slowly becoming an old man.

01:04.620 --> 01:05.620
And you know what?

01:05.620 --> 01:08.100
I'm not too insecure about it just yet.

01:08.100 --> 01:11.680
I'm sure everybody on some level is insecure about them getting old.

01:11.680 --> 01:15.340
And I would be lying to you if I said that it never ever bothered me.

01:15.340 --> 01:20.300
But I've realized that some of the political experiences I've discussed, some of the people

01:20.300 --> 01:24.380
who watch me don't share those experiences and it's primarily due to age.

01:24.380 --> 01:28.820
For example, the N64 was my big console of choice when I was a kid.

01:28.820 --> 01:31.020
That was kind of the era that I came from.

01:31.020 --> 01:36.180
Meanwhile, if you're 20 right now listening to this video, you grew up with the Wii.

01:36.180 --> 01:40.980
And that's kind of wild for me to think about because I picked up the Wii in my first year

01:40.980 --> 01:42.300
of university.

01:42.300 --> 01:47.060
That was like my university console, the Wii PS3 360 era.

01:47.060 --> 01:50.700
And yes, you can tell exactly what kind of person that I am because I'm judging era based

01:50.700 --> 01:53.200
on game console generation.

01:53.200 --> 01:56.520
But still though, the Wii feels at least a little bit new to me.

01:56.520 --> 01:59.840
It certainly doesn't feel like it's a classic console or anything, but some of you grew

01:59.840 --> 02:01.340
up with that console as kids.

02:01.340 --> 02:05.580
Some of you had it as the console that you played on when you were nine or 10 years old.

02:05.580 --> 02:08.560
Some of you went through your formative years with the Wii.

02:08.560 --> 02:13.760
It's kind of funny because, you know, in the early 2000s, millennials would get a whole

02:13.760 --> 02:14.760
lot of shit.

02:14.760 --> 02:15.760
And I'm a millennial.

02:15.760 --> 02:20.360
They were considered to be ridiculously left-wing, like to the point that when the first crowd

02:20.360 --> 02:24.760
of them came out of the universities, they were considered near unemployable because

02:24.760 --> 02:30.280
they were all basically spoiled children with a hyped up sense of self-importance, like

02:30.280 --> 02:35.360
the whole indigo child thing, the special snowflake, you know, that was my generation.

02:35.360 --> 02:39.760
I'm not surprised that we spawned the Occupy movement back in 2009 or whatever it was,

02:39.760 --> 02:44.680
which was large and loud, but ultimately disorganized and completely fell apart because people there

02:44.680 --> 02:47.240
had no idea what they were doing or what they were fighting for.

02:47.320 --> 02:50.840
And you know what, now that I'm thinking of it, I will say one thing about that era.

02:50.840 --> 02:55.840
At the very least, Obama's Democrats knew to like silently distance themselves from

02:55.840 --> 02:59.040
Occupy while the Republicans openly opposed it.

02:59.040 --> 03:03.760
At least they didn't full on embrace revolutionary communism like they're doing now.

03:03.760 --> 03:08.740
But the big joke for a long time is that millennials, due to their largely different habits from

03:08.740 --> 03:12.400
Gen Xers and Boomers, were destroying the American economy.

03:12.400 --> 03:16.880
And it was in fact a meme for a long time, just all of the things millennials were ruining.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.160
There's a list here.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.840
Millennials are killing the beer industry.

03:20.840 --> 03:24.120
Millennials are killing chains like Buffalo Wild Wings and Apple Bees.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.160
Sorry, Sargon.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.360
Psychologically scarred millennials are killing dozens of industries and it's their parents'

03:29.360 --> 03:30.880
fault.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.480
Millennials are killing the napkin industry.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.600
Millennials are killing the golf industry.

03:35.600 --> 03:38.520
Are millennials killing the car industry?

03:38.520 --> 03:41.860
Will millennials kill home ownership?

03:41.860 --> 03:45.800
Millennials could be a problem for America's most iconic motorcycle brand.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.160
Millennials are killing the 9-5 work week.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.880
They're killing focus groups.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.680
They're killing dinner dates.

03:51.680 --> 03:56.480
And just in general, millennials are killing it.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.680
And there's certainly some critique to be had here.

03:58.680 --> 04:01.280
The way that the Boomers lived was ridiculous.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.380
It was entirely non-sustainable.

04:03.380 --> 04:07.040
They inherited a post-war economy that they had little to do with actually building.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.520
It was their parents generally.

04:08.520 --> 04:11.240
They did a whole bunch of exploiting and selling out.

04:11.240 --> 04:15.080
And in a lot of instances, they're refusing to move aside to allow the next generation

04:15.080 --> 04:16.840
to come through.

04:16.840 --> 04:22.760
I think this is why the whole OK Boomer thing was that short-lived meme for a while.

04:22.760 --> 04:26.560
Because frankly, the way that Boomers have behaved has been pretty reprehensible.

04:26.560 --> 04:30.480
Boomers make up the majority of both the neo-cons and the neo-libs.

04:30.480 --> 04:34.920
They make up primarily both the bankers and corporatists that the far left complains about,

04:34.920 --> 04:39.300
as well as the globalists and career politicians that the far right complains about.

04:39.300 --> 04:44.200
So this idea that millennials are refusing to live like Boomers and the Boomers are getting

04:44.200 --> 04:46.720
worried about it, yeah, it's kind of funny.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.960
I'm not gonna lie.

04:47.960 --> 04:51.200
But we can't lay everything at the feet of the Boomers.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.200
Certainly not.

04:52.200 --> 04:56.680
In many ways, the millennials are just as entitled as the Boomers claim they are.

04:56.680 --> 05:01.160
Of course, the Boomers raised them to be that way, but that's another topic in a sense.

05:01.160 --> 05:02.280
They're still entitled.

05:02.280 --> 05:04.120
And they're not kids anymore, all right?

05:04.120 --> 05:07.600
People are still posting like, man, all those millennials are going out and partying and

05:07.600 --> 05:08.600
having a good time.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.600
Dude, millennials are like 30.

05:09.600 --> 05:10.600
They're 35 now.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.120
Some of them are even 40, I think.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.080
At this point, millennials are sellouts.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.080
However, they're not corporate sellouts.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.560
They're political sellouts.

05:17.560 --> 05:22.600
They're grasping onto fringe destructive theories like socialism because basically they have

05:22.600 --> 05:25.520
nothing left and they feel like their parents have robbed it from them.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.920
It's a strange paradigm because there's a lot of spoiled university kids out there who

05:28.920 --> 05:34.440
have been indoctrinated to hate their parents, mostly by their really shitty Marxist university

05:34.440 --> 05:35.440
teachers.

05:35.440 --> 05:39.080
But at the same time, there are definitely a lot of reasons to hate your average Boomer.

05:39.080 --> 05:42.760
And I'm sure some of those people actually do have shitty parents.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.040
Like check out this take for a minute.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.840
I know this is a far left take.

05:45.840 --> 05:50.580
This comes from Rami, I'm a progressive Muslim who never drinks and never has sex, but got

05:50.580 --> 05:53.680
drunk and fucked Zoe Quinn in a hotel room, Ismail.

05:53.680 --> 05:57.160
Big deal in the indie game dev world and also very far left.

05:57.160 --> 06:00.780
And despite that, at least some of this rings true, doesn't it?

06:00.780 --> 06:03.800
Millennials tell us the one thing they'd bring back from childhood.

06:03.800 --> 06:09.580
He replies with opportunity, democracy, privacy, ice caps, affordable education, rent, an actual

06:09.580 --> 06:13.320
job economy instead of a gig economy, hope, Napster.

06:13.320 --> 06:16.920
We can definitely lay some of this at the feet of the boomers for sure.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.400
But Rami, you're a millennial like me.

06:19.400 --> 06:20.840
We are not children anymore.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.820
We are in fact getting old.

06:22.820 --> 06:24.800
And some of this is our fault.

06:24.800 --> 06:29.520
There are opportunities out there, but it does seem like on some level millennials do

06:29.520 --> 06:31.680
not want to chase after them.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.280
They want things handed to them.

06:33.280 --> 06:36.520
Maybe it's because they saw that things were generally handed to the boomers, and they

06:36.520 --> 06:38.440
thought that's what life should be.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.020
But the boomers were an exception.

06:40.020 --> 06:41.840
Who is it that's eroding democracy?

06:41.840 --> 06:42.840
Really?

06:42.840 --> 06:43.840
Who?

06:43.840 --> 06:44.840
Who is it?

06:44.840 --> 06:46.820
I know that you think it's the dreaded far right.

06:46.820 --> 06:51.600
But considering that the left has been co-opted by revolutionary communists, I think democracy

06:51.600 --> 06:55.920
would begin to disappear if somebody that you endorsed ever held real power.

06:55.920 --> 06:56.920
Privacy.

06:56.920 --> 06:57.920
Okay.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.080
Isn't that being eroded by far left corporations?

07:00.080 --> 07:02.640
I know you think that's an oxymoron, but it really isn't.

07:02.640 --> 07:07.700
You have these corporations pushing progressive values, becoming ever more globalist.

07:07.700 --> 07:10.880
And by the way, there's certainly a leftist element to globalism, you know, the whole

07:10.880 --> 07:12.500
worldwide communism thing.

07:12.500 --> 07:16.560
The radical left might complain about big tech taking away privacy, but they still want

07:16.560 --> 07:20.000
that big tech cartel to be empowered because they control it.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.080
And I could keep going on this list, but I don't want this video to be hours and hours

07:23.080 --> 07:24.080
long.

07:24.080 --> 07:28.160
The point is, Rami, and to basically every other lefty millennial out there, we're not

07:28.160 --> 07:29.160
kids anymore.

07:29.160 --> 07:32.240
We're not playing our Super Nintendos in the basement at five years old or whatever the

07:32.840 --> 07:33.840
case may be.

07:33.840 --> 07:38.200
We are adults now, we're responsible for our lives, and a lot of this stuff can in fact

07:38.200 --> 07:39.200
be laid at our feet.

07:39.200 --> 07:43.320
And as a quick aside, if you ever wanted to see somebody who's really stuck in the past,

07:43.320 --> 07:45.040
just go look at Moviebob's feet.

07:45.040 --> 07:51.520
The right wing has an abject, roiling, seething hatred for smart, driven, creative people,

07:51.520 --> 07:53.680
but not even as they exist now.

07:53.680 --> 07:57.720
It's an unresolved residual hatred of the younger incarnations they remember from school

07:57.720 --> 08:02.400
age, or more likely, a bitterness at the idea that they grew up to be something.

08:02.400 --> 08:06.880
Bob, I know that you're talking about your political opponents, but it really sounds

08:06.880 --> 08:09.240
like you're talking about yourself here, man.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.800
You may need to let the past go a little bit.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.520
I know you were probably bullied, hell, I was bullied.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.600
I had a lot of enemies in grade school.

08:16.600 --> 08:21.240
It was a time when it was not yet cool to play video games, it was not yet common to

08:21.240 --> 08:26.120
play video games, so if you were a gamer, you were ostracized by basically half the

08:26.120 --> 08:29.920
school year because you were not one of the cool kids, you were not one of the athletic

08:29.920 --> 08:32.360
kids, you were not one of the charismatic kids.

08:32.360 --> 08:36.200
You were certainly made fun of by all the girls as well, and your choice of friend was

08:36.200 --> 08:38.800
basically, does this guy like games?

08:38.800 --> 08:42.160
Okay, I guess we're friends because there's no one else.

08:42.160 --> 08:45.600
Moviebob's a little bit older than me, but I think we had a similar experience, at least

08:45.600 --> 08:47.600
when it comes to video games in school.

08:47.600 --> 08:48.600
And you know what?

08:48.600 --> 08:49.600
I kind of get what he's saying.

08:49.600 --> 08:53.000
Whenever I think back on the bullies of my childhood, I still have that little bit of

08:53.000 --> 08:58.120
twinge, that little knee-jerk reaction of, oh yeah, that guy was an asshole, fuck him.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.980
And maybe the person still is an asshole, maybe he's not.

09:00.980 --> 09:04.080
Maybe if I looked one of them up on Facebook, they'd be a regular person.

09:04.080 --> 09:08.580
I still have no desire to go and interact with them now, I've moved on.

09:08.580 --> 09:11.080
But that's the point, is that I've moved on.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.240
Bob, you may need to move on.

09:13.240 --> 09:17.720
Remember, this is coming from a guy who got mad over the Sonic the Hedgehog movie because

09:17.720 --> 09:24.240
he bought into the whole console war thing of the 90s so hard that here we are 25 years

09:24.240 --> 09:26.700
later and he's still going on about it.

09:26.700 --> 09:32.200
The nice, normal people of the world still haven't forgiven me for being born.

09:32.200 --> 09:38.680
I don't know how common Moviebob's sentiment is among millennials, but if it was at least

09:38.680 --> 09:41.280
somewhat common, I wouldn't be surprised.

09:41.280 --> 09:45.660
It kind of fits into the whole perpetual victimhood thing, you know?

09:45.660 --> 09:47.640
But this is not a video about Moviebob.

09:47.640 --> 09:50.820
I'm sure that will come one day, but for now we have to move on.

09:50.820 --> 09:54.680
How many of you recall this comic floating around the Twittersphere about a year ago?

09:54.680 --> 09:57.520
Wow, that 90s movie I used to love is on Netflix!

09:57.520 --> 10:01.520
Haha, cool, I haven't seen this in years, let's watch it.

10:01.520 --> 10:04.860
Oh, gross, that was really sexist.

10:04.860 --> 10:06.640
That seemed kinda racist.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.120
I don't remember this movie being so homophobic.

10:09.120 --> 10:12.220
I guess I forgot all about this transphobia.

10:12.220 --> 10:13.720
The 90s sucked.

10:13.720 --> 10:19.240
I know at some point I'm going to have to do a much more in-depth look at the whole

10:19.240 --> 10:23.740
erasing of culture that millennial leftists seem to be engaging in right now.

10:23.740 --> 10:30.240
And I know it's not just movies on Netflix or whatever, it's also statues and stuff like

10:30.240 --> 10:31.240
that.

10:31.240 --> 10:34.100
They basically want to erase all of culture, and I'll have something more in-depth to say

10:34.100 --> 10:35.900
about that at a future time.

10:35.900 --> 10:38.920
But I brought this comic up for a very specific reason.

10:38.920 --> 10:44.000
And no, it's not because the author self-insert is, once again, quite unattractive looking.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.300
I don't know why people draw themselves this unattractively.

10:47.300 --> 10:51.480
Of course, the hentai variant of it kinda fixed that.

10:51.480 --> 10:57.000
I can't scroll any further down though because this video would instantly be yeeted off YouTube

10:57.000 --> 10:58.320
into oblivion.

10:58.320 --> 11:04.560
No, it was because in some ways, and it's going to sound strange but hear me out, in

11:04.560 --> 11:08.560
some ways the millennials have become their own boomers.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.040
Here's what I mean by that.

11:10.040 --> 11:14.020
Earlier we talked about all the ways that millennials were destroying things, they were

11:14.020 --> 11:20.000
destroying industries back in 2010 or 2012 or 2015, back when they were all young and

11:20.000 --> 11:22.160
fresh-faced and in college.

11:22.160 --> 11:27.240
But now that they're 30, or they're 35, they have some grey hair coming in, they have kids,

11:27.240 --> 11:31.120
they've stopped partying so much, they're putting some money away, they're working a

11:31.120 --> 11:33.960
regular 9-5, they're selling out basically.

11:33.960 --> 11:38.320
Now that millennials have become the establishment that they protested 10 or 15 years ago, they

11:38.320 --> 11:44.040
are saying about Gen Z the exact same stuff that was said about them, and was even said

11:44.040 --> 11:46.400
about Gen X back when Gen X was young.

11:46.400 --> 11:53.020
From Vice Magazine's power and privilege issue, the hot new Gen Z trend is skipping college.

11:53.020 --> 11:57.400
High schoolers are weighing the benefits of blue-collar trades at a time when well-paying

11:57.400 --> 12:00.160
jobs and no debt are hard to pass up.

12:00.160 --> 12:03.000
Oh no, they're not going to our degree farms.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.960
How will we indoctrinate the next generation with mandatory gender studies classes?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.320
Do you have white teenage sons?

12:09.320 --> 12:10.320
Listen up.

12:10.320 --> 12:13.400
How white supremacists are recruiting boys online.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.000
Oh no, white supremacy is coming through the ethernet cables.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.480
This is from the ADL.

12:18.480 --> 12:19.480
This is not a game.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.080
How steam harbors extremists.

12:21.080 --> 12:25.120
And it's basically a pamphlet on how if your son or daughter has a steam account, they're

12:25.120 --> 12:29.080
playing video games on their computers, they're probably Nazis.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.880
And speaking of Nazis, this is from the Washington Post.

12:31.880 --> 12:36.600
Nazi flag displayed in high school window prompts anger and an investigation.

12:36.600 --> 12:42.560
Now those of you who have not forgotten what it's like to be a kid or a teenager or just

12:42.560 --> 12:45.080
a troublemaker, I guess, what does it sound like?

12:45.080 --> 12:47.800
It sounds like a prank.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.440
It sounds like a joke, doesn't it?

12:50.440 --> 12:54.840
It sounds like some kids who, by the way, aren't Nazis understand that the Nazi flag

12:54.840 --> 12:57.540
riles people up, especially old boomers.

12:57.540 --> 12:59.120
So they put it in the window.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.260
They were explicitly irreverent.

13:01.260 --> 13:03.440
They were being edgy just for the sake of it.

13:03.440 --> 13:06.360
But as it turns out, they're not riling up boomers anymore.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.080
They're riling up millennials.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.460
This is before my time.

13:09.460 --> 13:13.420
But back in the 80s, there was definitely a campaign against Dungeons and Dragons.

13:13.420 --> 13:18.500
The idea was that if you played tabletop, you're part of some kind of satanic cult.

13:18.500 --> 13:22.080
Back when Elvis was popular, they said the same thing about him and the Beatles.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.700
They did it for rock and roll.

13:23.700 --> 13:25.400
They did it for video games.

13:25.400 --> 13:30.680
When the Columbine school shooters did their thing back in 1999, the media blamed the shooting

13:30.680 --> 13:35.300
on the fact that it was discovered that these two kids had a copy of Doom in their house.

13:35.300 --> 13:38.000
And even when that shooting happened, Doom was old news, man.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.100
The first Doom came out in 1993.

13:40.100 --> 13:46.560
It was very clearly a case of an older generation not fully understanding a younger generation

13:46.560 --> 13:49.340
and simply slapping pieces together and seeing what stuck.

13:49.340 --> 13:53.060
In the early 2000s, Jack Chick comics went viral.

13:53.060 --> 13:57.080
These were basically just little comics that were handed out by religious people talking

13:57.080 --> 14:01.140
about all the dangerous, sinful things that young people get into nowadays.

14:01.140 --> 14:04.220
This image is probably the most popular one just because of the ridiculousness on this

14:04.220 --> 14:05.220
woman's face.

14:05.220 --> 14:06.700
And it's about D&D.

14:06.700 --> 14:13.500
My point is millennials, and to a lesser extent, Gen Xers, were demonized for decades for every

14:13.500 --> 14:19.500
single thing that they did by a generation of people who had no idea what their kids

14:19.500 --> 14:25.340
were actually doing, what they were actually demonizing them for, and what they were scapegoating.

14:25.340 --> 14:27.660
Didn't matter if it was blood and mortal combat.

14:27.660 --> 14:30.940
Didn't matter if it was Dungeons and Dragons having satanic imagery.

14:30.940 --> 14:33.900
Didn't matter if it was rap music and the explicit lyrics.

14:33.900 --> 14:34.900
Didn't matter.

14:34.900 --> 14:39.580
They disapproved based on their sensibilities and then turned around and said the kids today,

14:39.580 --> 14:41.580
their kids, had gone wrong.

14:41.580 --> 14:46.040
And to a young millennial who was in high school in the year 2001 or something, these

14:46.040 --> 14:48.100
people were laughing stocks.

14:48.100 --> 14:52.640
The ones that were floating around for me specifically in high school were like, one,

14:52.640 --> 14:57.660
the whole rainbow cock thing where basically girls would put on different types of lipstick

14:57.660 --> 15:04.300
and then go give guys blowjobs and if a guy got every color on his dick, he won or something.

15:04.300 --> 15:05.700
And then secondly, Jenkim.

15:05.700 --> 15:10.900
And Jenkim was a big meme in 2007 where basically kids would basically just take shit, like

15:10.900 --> 15:16.380
fermented human shit, put it in a bottle, let it bubble up, and then breathe the gases

15:16.380 --> 15:17.560
to get high.

15:17.560 --> 15:22.020
The problem is both of these instances, they might have happened a little bit, but they

15:22.020 --> 15:23.220
were never widespread.

15:23.220 --> 15:29.020
The stories, the rumors, were always jokes that people my age were playing on the boomers.

15:29.020 --> 15:32.700
We said this shit was happening and then they would write articles about it and it would

15:32.700 --> 15:34.480
be a big fucking laugh.

15:34.480 --> 15:39.780
And now the millennials, I guess because they're just too stupid or they're too politically

15:39.780 --> 15:45.780
driven nowadays or something, they don't understand that Gen Z is doing the exact same thing to

15:45.780 --> 15:46.780
them.

15:46.780 --> 15:52.500
Like with the whole okay hand symbol being a symbol of racism or white milk or something.

15:52.500 --> 15:57.380
These are things that kids on 4chan pushed and millennials, forgetting the fact that

15:57.380 --> 16:00.620
they were once young, ate that shit up and believed it.

16:00.620 --> 16:03.020
Or there's the whole Hawaiian shirt thing happening right now.

16:03.020 --> 16:08.380
Oh, the Boogaloo boys, they're wearing Hawaiian shirts like it's Miami Vice or something.

16:08.380 --> 16:11.020
Walking around with their guns talking about starting a civil war.

16:11.020 --> 16:12.580
Oh my God, we have to do something.

16:12.580 --> 16:17.700
Oh my God, kids are throwing coronavirus parties where whoever catches the virus wins.

16:17.700 --> 16:18.740
We have to stop it.

16:18.740 --> 16:20.080
Our kids are going crazy.

16:20.080 --> 16:25.280
And here's that article written by Faith Karimi and Jameel Lynch on CNN.

16:25.280 --> 16:28.700
Jesus, that's an unfortunate last name.

16:28.700 --> 16:31.240
But here's the LinkedIn account of the two people involved.

16:31.240 --> 16:35.760
Now I've got a way to view LinkedIn accounts without actually being logged into LinkedIn

16:35.760 --> 16:38.580
because LinkedIn is a fucking cancer zone.

16:38.580 --> 16:41.500
So sorry if it looks a little bit strange, but it is accurate.

16:41.500 --> 16:47.420
So Jameel Lynch, she's the national desk editor for CNN since October, 2016.

16:47.420 --> 16:50.900
She worked for Fox, she worked for KUSA TV, KC TV.

16:50.900 --> 16:54.920
She was ABC 7 Chicago back in 2006.

16:54.920 --> 16:58.000
She had a few small jobs working her way up.

16:58.000 --> 17:04.380
And then from 2001 to 2006, she got her BA in television writing and producing at the

17:04.380 --> 17:05.500
Columbia College.

17:05.500 --> 17:06.900
Well, okay.

17:06.900 --> 17:10.940
So she is probably about four or five years older than me.

17:10.940 --> 17:12.740
That puts her squarely as a millennial.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.420
Here's Faith Karimi.

17:14.420 --> 17:21.620
She's desk editor at CNN since 2009, Baltimore Sun at 2006, and before that she was at Grambling

17:21.620 --> 17:25.740
State University to get her master's in journalism and mass communications.

17:25.740 --> 17:28.340
So again, probably around the same age.

17:28.340 --> 17:29.340
Millennial.

17:29.340 --> 17:34.440
These two are old enough to remember pranking their teachers back during the era where being

17:34.440 --> 17:40.220
a prankster was considered one of the great things for kids to do, you know, the MTV era,

17:40.220 --> 17:41.460
the jackass era.

17:41.460 --> 17:44.980
And here they are writing articles about this nonsense.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.740
Millennials have almost forgotten what it was like to be children.

17:47.740 --> 17:51.120
And I know that happens eventually as you as you grow up, which is kind of how it is.

17:51.120 --> 17:54.860
But like, I never expected them to become boomers themselves.

17:54.860 --> 18:00.420
I never expected something like no pixels for fascists to come out of out of millennial

18:00.420 --> 18:04.700
thought maligning gamers and YouTubers as fascist enablers.

18:04.700 --> 18:10.260
This is the kind of stuff that you'd see Jack Thompson do back in the late 90s.

18:10.260 --> 18:14.860
Trying to have video games censored because they didn't meet his moral sensibilities.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.340
My generation is getting old.

18:16.340 --> 18:21.500
And considering that they're tied with the boomers and being the most entitled spoiled

18:21.500 --> 18:26.140
generation that's ever come along with the only difference being a superficial swing

18:26.140 --> 18:29.540
leftward instead of a superficial swing rightward for the boomers.

18:29.540 --> 18:34.460
I am not surprised that as millennials, you know, hit the late 20s, early 30s, some of

18:34.460 --> 18:36.460
them are probably approaching 40 at this point.

18:36.460 --> 18:39.940
I am not surprised that they are morphing into authoritarians just like the boomers

18:39.940 --> 18:40.940
did.

18:40.940 --> 18:46.500
I am not surprised that they are hypocritical, wasteful, closed minded, ignorant, with the

18:46.500 --> 18:50.820
only difference being that they slap a left wing coat of paint on it instead of a right

18:50.820 --> 18:52.580
wing coat like their parents.

18:52.580 --> 18:58.380
But most importantly of all, I think, is that unlike the boomers, the millennials were so

18:58.380 --> 19:02.880
spoiled that they actually grew up believing they would never get old.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.260
The spotlight would always be on them.

19:05.260 --> 19:08.500
They would always be the arbiter of what is new and cool.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.540
That mindset explains takes like this.

19:11.540 --> 19:16.560
The best that can come of coronavirus is elderly conservatives all die, the billionaires get

19:16.560 --> 19:21.740
their backs to the wall, the economy collapses and is reborn like a phoenix from its ashes

19:21.740 --> 19:27.140
as a socialist economy, and millennials emerge from quarantine horny as fuck and start making

19:27.140 --> 19:28.140
babies.

19:28.140 --> 19:31.660
They legitimately want what is considered to be old, decrepit.

19:31.660 --> 19:37.780
Not just old people, but old history, old styles of thought, old ideas, to be swept

19:37.780 --> 19:40.860
away, to be violently swept away in fact.

19:40.860 --> 19:46.580
To be forcefully destroyed if necessary, to make breathing room for the millennials.

19:46.580 --> 19:50.780
And they are doing this because they genuinely can't conceive of a future, by the way the

19:50.780 --> 19:56.840
only possible future, where one day they are old, and one day they will be swept aside

19:56.840 --> 19:58.340
by the younger generation.

19:58.340 --> 20:00.940
But that is what getting old is all about.

20:00.940 --> 20:02.560
It happens to everyone.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.720
One day I'll be dead.

20:04.720 --> 20:08.600
One day everyone I know, everyone I care about, will be dead.

20:08.600 --> 20:12.720
One day you will be dead, as well as everyone you care about too.

20:12.720 --> 20:16.060
On some level life is fundamentally a tragedy.

20:16.060 --> 20:21.700
Right now there is an intense hatred of the older generations, and it's a hatred that

20:21.700 --> 20:26.280
I've experienced and remember quite fondly during my time as an SJW, I've made a video

20:26.280 --> 20:28.620
about that if you want to go watch that.

20:28.620 --> 20:34.380
But basically, I remember thinking, oh those old people, how could they be so backward,

20:34.380 --> 20:36.900
how could they think like this, how could they behave like this?

20:36.900 --> 20:40.600
And you know what, on some level I was right, there are definitely objectionable things

20:40.600 --> 20:44.280
that old people do, because they just don't know any better, and we've actually found

20:44.280 --> 20:45.860
better ways to do things.

20:45.860 --> 20:50.380
But I don't think that that's a moral justification for legitimate hatred, to actually wanting

20:50.380 --> 20:52.680
to wipe out the boomers or something.

20:52.680 --> 20:57.340
But yeah, our current culture does revolve around the youth experience, you know, all

20:57.340 --> 21:01.500
the stories are like young adult adventures, they're in high school or they're in their

21:01.500 --> 21:05.820
twenties and they're going off to have some kind of grand adventure in their young years.

21:05.820 --> 21:09.820
During all these formative times in their life, romance is considered to be the domain

21:09.820 --> 21:11.100
of the young.

21:11.100 --> 21:15.380
Schooling and learning are things that young people are expected to do, but not old people.

21:15.380 --> 21:19.220
There is definitely this focus on the younger experience, and I think that that's basically

21:19.220 --> 21:24.380
culminated in the millennial mindset, this idea that they will never be out of style,

21:24.380 --> 21:26.580
they will never be what's not cool.

21:26.580 --> 21:31.380
But I mean, millennials are having kids now, and to those kids, their parents are definitely

21:31.380 --> 21:32.700
what's not cool.

21:32.700 --> 21:35.860
At this point, I'm just kind of rambling, so let me get to my thesis here.

21:35.860 --> 21:40.560
I believe that the modernist lifestyle that my generation has been raised into, and this

21:40.560 --> 21:45.100
is not a full critique of modernism, there's a lot of great things about the modern material

21:45.100 --> 21:49.300
world, I would not have it any other way, but one of its major drawbacks is the fact

21:49.300 --> 21:54.220
that I think millennials are generally spiritually stunted, doesn't mean they have to be religious,

21:54.220 --> 21:59.220
the religion can help, but they definitely don't believe in anything beyond the physical.

21:59.220 --> 22:04.500
They believe that the entire human experience can be quantified by science as biology or

22:04.500 --> 22:08.360
something, which is actually quite funny, because whenever you talk about trans issues,

22:08.360 --> 22:11.820
they'll call you a biological essentialist, as if that's a bad thing.

22:11.820 --> 22:17.340
They'll completely deny human nature in a lot of ways, but yet they still invoke biology

22:17.340 --> 22:20.180
when it comes to the human experience, it's quite strange.

22:20.180 --> 22:24.860
Nonetheless, to them, there is no spiritual, there is no meaning, it's all just tricks

22:24.860 --> 22:28.220
of the mind, and you know, maybe it is on a practical level, but that kind of thinking

22:28.220 --> 22:31.900
certainly leads to the existential depression that a lot of millennials seem to be facing

22:31.900 --> 22:36.280
right now, and the way that they deal with that is they become radically self-centered,

22:36.280 --> 22:40.080
and they spent decades within the culture of youth having that reinforced.

22:40.080 --> 22:44.520
So yes, they were screwed by the boomers, but they're also massively entitled as well.

22:44.520 --> 22:48.860
Both of these things are true, but age is creeping up on the millennials now.

22:49.420 --> 22:53.620
They don't see it, or they're blinded to it, or they're purposely trying not to look,

22:53.620 --> 22:54.620
but it's happening.

22:54.620 --> 22:59.980
And if we had to define the source of, I guess we could call it millennial rage, it would

22:59.980 --> 23:05.140
not be the economy, it would not be capitalism, it would not necessarily be the boomers, though

23:05.140 --> 23:09.700
I do think their rage towards those things are symptoms of the larger problem, but the

23:09.700 --> 23:12.040
source is their own mortality.

23:12.040 --> 23:18.460
They grew up experiencing such abundance, and in an environment and culture that centered

23:18.460 --> 23:24.460
them so much for so long, causing the extended adolescence man-child phenomenon in some cases,

23:24.460 --> 23:29.700
that they have no idea how to deal with the fact that they're old, that they're getting

23:29.700 --> 23:32.080
old, that they'll die one day.

23:32.080 --> 23:35.900
They haven't yet fully realized that when they were in school thinking their teacher

23:35.900 --> 23:38.940
was an old man, that's the age they are now.

23:38.940 --> 23:44.900
They haven't yet fully realized that no, they're no longer 21, and therefore thinking an 18-year-old

23:44.900 --> 23:47.180
girl is hot is kind of weird now.

23:47.180 --> 23:50.620
Maybe this explains all the social justice apologetics for pedophilia that we're seeing

23:50.620 --> 23:51.620
right now.

23:51.620 --> 23:55.140
And of course, because of all of this, they definitely can't understand that when the

23:55.140 --> 23:59.060
younger generation rebels against them, and decides to piss them off a little bit just

23:59.060 --> 24:03.460
for the sake of pissing them off, that no, they're not actually being radicalized to

24:03.460 --> 24:08.000
be Nazis or white supremacists or the alt-right or something ridiculous like that.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.540
They're just being edgy.

24:09.540 --> 24:12.020
They can't see that because they think they're still young.

24:12.020 --> 24:15.620
They think, oh no, we're the ones being edgy by being far left.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.260
People know things have changed.

24:17.260 --> 24:21.540
Within the next 10 years, I expect a lot of the millennials to start going absolutely

24:21.540 --> 24:25.540
apeshit as they realize that they're 45 with gray hair.

24:25.540 --> 24:29.460
They're thinking of buying that sports car as their midlife crisis, that they are in

24:29.460 --> 24:31.580
essence the dads that they hate.

24:31.580 --> 24:32.580
And you know what?

24:32.580 --> 24:34.820
So far, I've been mostly talking like this doesn't apply to me.

24:34.820 --> 24:35.820
I don't think so.

24:35.820 --> 24:36.820
It absolutely does apply to me.

24:36.820 --> 24:37.820
I'm getting old too.

24:37.820 --> 24:42.000
I am at least somewhat determined not to get old as I get older, meaning that I'm still

24:42.000 --> 24:44.480
going to at least be open to new ideas.

24:44.480 --> 24:50.520
But I do think that true maturity is balancing both the young and the old.

24:50.520 --> 24:54.640
It's not simply believing blindly that you are a teenager when you're obviously not,

24:54.640 --> 24:59.280
but it's also not giving up your passions like a lot of, you know, boomer style adults

24:59.280 --> 25:00.280
do.

25:00.280 --> 25:03.400
And ironically enough, I think that's actually the best way to avoid getting old.

25:03.400 --> 25:07.720
You don't cling to this identity, this notion that you are the youth because that just leads

25:07.720 --> 25:11.720
you to becoming insular, isolated, basically boomers.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.680
Like all the examples we've talked about today.

25:13.680 --> 25:19.480
But you do recognize that even as you age, you can still enjoy your life.

25:19.480 --> 25:24.140
Understand who you are and where you are, both in place and in time.

25:24.140 --> 25:28.280
But don't let that sour the things that you truly love.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.960
I think that's how you stay young.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.920
And that's something I'm going to try to do.

25:31.920 --> 25:34.040
Anyway, sorry for the very long rant.

25:34.040 --> 25:36.520
This is coming out on July 4th.

25:36.520 --> 25:40.440
So if you pop over to my Twitch stream pretty much right now as the video goes up, I'm going

25:40.440 --> 25:44.560
to be playing an appropriately themed America July 4th game.

25:44.560 --> 25:45.780
So please check it out.

25:45.780 --> 25:48.520
That's twitch.tv slash game boomers.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.420
And hey, if you don't want to, that's fine, too.

25:50.420 --> 25:52.440
I'll see you tomorrow for the weekly sip.

25:52.440 --> 25:53.640
I love you guys.

25:53.640 --> 25:54.840
And remember, stay young.
