1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Yes, I know this is not the Chaz video, but unironically I do have it on the way.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,280
It is in the pipeline, it's in the render queue as Spoonie would say.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,920
No really, check my editing drive.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:18,080
Here's two hours of raw commentary and another ten minutes of addendums once some new stories

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,240
came out about it.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,120
The only thing I'm waiting on now is to see if any of those arrests from yesterday materialize

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,280
into a news story.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,280
I'll tack that onto the video and then I'll release it, so you'll probably see it Monday

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,880
or Tuesday or something.

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,040
Sorry it's taken this long, but really, I am working on it.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,520
But I'm doing this video because I've realized something.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,800
Over the past dozen, maybe twenty videos or so that I've done on this channel, I've noticed

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,000
a trend.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,160
And the trend basically amounts to the fact that I'm getting old.

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,680
I'm referencing past political paradigms.

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,780
I'm talking about the 2012 or 2008 elections as if they're at least somewhat new.

17
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,280
I'm still disappointed that the left is not the left of the 90s, the left that I was a

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
part of.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,620
I am slowly becoming an old man.

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,620
And you know what?

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,100
I'm not too insecure about it just yet.

22
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm sure everybody on some level is insecure about them getting old.

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,340
And I would be lying to you if I said that it never ever bothered me.

24
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,300
But I've realized that some of the political experiences I've discussed, some of the people

25
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,380
who watch me don't share those experiences and it's primarily due to age.

26
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,820
For example, the N64 was my big console of choice when I was a kid.

27
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,020
That was kind of the era that I came from.

28
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,180
Meanwhile, if you're 20 right now listening to this video, you grew up with the Wii.

29
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,980
And that's kind of wild for me to think about because I picked up the Wii in my first year

30
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,300
of university.

31
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:47,060
That was like my university console, the Wii PS3 360 era.

32
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,700
And yes, you can tell exactly what kind of person that I am because I'm judging era based

33
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,200
on game console generation.

34
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,520
But still though, the Wii feels at least a little bit new to me.

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,840
It certainly doesn't feel like it's a classic console or anything, but some of you grew

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,340
up with that console as kids.

37
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,580
Some of you had it as the console that you played on when you were nine or 10 years old.

38
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,560
Some of you went through your formative years with the Wii.

39
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,760
It's kind of funny because, you know, in the early 2000s, millennials would get a whole

40
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
lot of shit.

41
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
And I'm a millennial.

42
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,360
They were considered to be ridiculously left-wing, like to the point that when the first crowd

43
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,760
of them came out of the universities, they were considered near unemployable because

44
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,280
they were all basically spoiled children with a hyped up sense of self-importance, like

45
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,360
the whole indigo child thing, the special snowflake, you know, that was my generation.

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,760
I'm not surprised that we spawned the Occupy movement back in 2009 or whatever it was,

47
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,680
which was large and loud, but ultimately disorganized and completely fell apart because people there

48
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,240
had no idea what they were doing or what they were fighting for.

49
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,840
And you know what, now that I'm thinking of it, I will say one thing about that era.

50
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,840
At the very least, Obama's Democrats knew to like silently distance themselves from

51
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,040
Occupy while the Republicans openly opposed it.

52
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,760
At least they didn't full on embrace revolutionary communism like they're doing now.

53
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,740
But the big joke for a long time is that millennials, due to their largely different habits from

54
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,400
Gen Xers and Boomers, were destroying the American economy.

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,880
And it was in fact a meme for a long time, just all of the things millennials were ruining.

56
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,160
There's a list here.

57
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,840
Millennials are killing the beer industry.

58
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,120
Millennials are killing chains like Buffalo Wild Wings and Apple Bees.

59
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,160
Sorry, Sargon.

60
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,360
Psychologically scarred millennials are killing dozens of industries and it's their parents'

61
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,880
fault.

62
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,480
Millennials are killing the napkin industry.

63
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,600
Millennials are killing the golf industry.

64
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,520
Are millennials killing the car industry?

65
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,860
Will millennials kill home ownership?

66
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,800
Millennials could be a problem for America's most iconic motorcycle brand.

67
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,160
Millennials are killing the 9-5 work week.

68
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,880
They're killing focus groups.

69
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,680
They're killing dinner dates.

70
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,480
And just in general, millennials are killing it.

71
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,680
And there's certainly some critique to be had here.

72
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,280
The way that the Boomers lived was ridiculous.

73
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,380
It was entirely non-sustainable.

74
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,040
They inherited a post-war economy that they had little to do with actually building.

75
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,520
It was their parents generally.

76
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,240
They did a whole bunch of exploiting and selling out.

77
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,080
And in a lot of instances, they're refusing to move aside to allow the next generation

78
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,840
to come through.

79
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,760
I think this is why the whole OK Boomer thing was that short-lived meme for a while.

80
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,560
Because frankly, the way that Boomers have behaved has been pretty reprehensible.

81
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,480
Boomers make up the majority of both the neo-cons and the neo-libs.

82
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,920
They make up primarily both the bankers and corporatists that the far left complains about,

83
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,300
as well as the globalists and career politicians that the far right complains about.

84
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,200
So this idea that millennials are refusing to live like Boomers and the Boomers are getting

85
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,720
worried about it, yeah, it's kind of funny.

86
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,960
I'm not gonna lie.

87
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,200
But we can't lay everything at the feet of the Boomers.

88
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Certainly not.

89
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,680
In many ways, the millennials are just as entitled as the Boomers claim they are.

90
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,160
Of course, the Boomers raised them to be that way, but that's another topic in a sense.

91
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,280
They're still entitled.

92
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,120
And they're not kids anymore, all right?

93
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,600
People are still posting like, man, all those millennials are going out and partying and

94
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
having a good time.

95
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Dude, millennials are like 30.

96
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
They're 35 now.

97
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,120
Some of them are even 40, I think.

98
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,080
At this point, millennials are sellouts.

99
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
However, they're not corporate sellouts.

100
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,560
They're political sellouts.

101
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,600
They're grasping onto fringe destructive theories like socialism because basically they have

102
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,520
nothing left and they feel like their parents have robbed it from them.

103
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,920
It's a strange paradigm because there's a lot of spoiled university kids out there who

104
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:34,440
have been indoctrinated to hate their parents, mostly by their really shitty Marxist university

105
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
teachers.

106
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,080
But at the same time, there are definitely a lot of reasons to hate your average Boomer.

107
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,760
And I'm sure some of those people actually do have shitty parents.

108
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,040
Like check out this take for a minute.

109
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,840
I know this is a far left take.

110
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,580
This comes from Rami, I'm a progressive Muslim who never drinks and never has sex, but got

111
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,680
drunk and fucked Zoe Quinn in a hotel room, Ismail.

112
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,160
Big deal in the indie game dev world and also very far left.

113
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,780
And despite that, at least some of this rings true, doesn't it?

114
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,800
Millennials tell us the one thing they'd bring back from childhood.

115
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,580
He replies with opportunity, democracy, privacy, ice caps, affordable education, rent, an actual

116
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,320
job economy instead of a gig economy, hope, Napster.

117
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,920
We can definitely lay some of this at the feet of the boomers for sure.

118
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,400
But Rami, you're a millennial like me.

119
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,840
We are not children anymore.

120
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,820
We are in fact getting old.

121
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,800
And some of this is our fault.

122
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,520
There are opportunities out there, but it does seem like on some level millennials do

123
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,680
not want to chase after them.

124
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,280
They want things handed to them.

125
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,520
Maybe it's because they saw that things were generally handed to the boomers, and they

126
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,440
thought that's what life should be.

127
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,020
But the boomers were an exception.

128
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,840
Who is it that's eroding democracy?

129
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
Really?

130
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,840
Who?

131
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
Who is it?

132
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,820
I know that you think it's the dreaded far right.

133
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,600
But considering that the left has been co-opted by revolutionary communists, I think democracy

134
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,920
would begin to disappear if somebody that you endorsed ever held real power.

135
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Privacy.

136
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Okay.

137
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,080
Isn't that being eroded by far left corporations?

138
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,640
I know you think that's an oxymoron, but it really isn't.

139
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,700
You have these corporations pushing progressive values, becoming ever more globalist.

140
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,880
And by the way, there's certainly a leftist element to globalism, you know, the whole

141
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,500
worldwide communism thing.

142
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,560
The radical left might complain about big tech taking away privacy, but they still want

143
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,000
that big tech cartel to be empowered because they control it.

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,080
And I could keep going on this list, but I don't want this video to be hours and hours

145
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,080
long.

146
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,160
The point is, Rami, and to basically every other lefty millennial out there, we're not

147
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
kids anymore.

148
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,240
We're not playing our Super Nintendos in the basement at five years old or whatever the

149
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,840
case may be.

150
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,200
We are adults now, we're responsible for our lives, and a lot of this stuff can in fact

151
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
be laid at our feet.

152
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,320
And as a quick aside, if you ever wanted to see somebody who's really stuck in the past,

153
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,040
just go look at Moviebob's feet.

154
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:51,520
The right wing has an abject, roiling, seething hatred for smart, driven, creative people,

155
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,680
but not even as they exist now.

156
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,720
It's an unresolved residual hatred of the younger incarnations they remember from school

157
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,400
age, or more likely, a bitterness at the idea that they grew up to be something.

158
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,880
Bob, I know that you're talking about your political opponents, but it really sounds

159
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,240
like you're talking about yourself here, man.

160
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,800
You may need to let the past go a little bit.

161
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,520
I know you were probably bullied, hell, I was bullied.

162
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,600
I had a lot of enemies in grade school.

163
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,240
It was a time when it was not yet cool to play video games, it was not yet common to

164
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,120
play video games, so if you were a gamer, you were ostracized by basically half the

165
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,920
school year because you were not one of the cool kids, you were not one of the athletic

166
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,360
kids, you were not one of the charismatic kids.

167
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,200
You were certainly made fun of by all the girls as well, and your choice of friend was

168
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,800
basically, does this guy like games?

169
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,160
Okay, I guess we're friends because there's no one else.

170
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,600
Moviebob's a little bit older than me, but I think we had a similar experience, at least

171
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
when it comes to video games in school.

172
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
And you know what?

173
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
I kind of get what he's saying.

174
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,000
Whenever I think back on the bullies of my childhood, I still have that little bit of

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,120
twinge, that little knee-jerk reaction of, oh yeah, that guy was an asshole, fuck him.

176
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,980
And maybe the person still is an asshole, maybe he's not.

177
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,080
Maybe if I looked one of them up on Facebook, they'd be a regular person.

178
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,580
I still have no desire to go and interact with them now, I've moved on.

179
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,080
But that's the point, is that I've moved on.

180
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,240
Bob, you may need to move on.

181
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,720
Remember, this is coming from a guy who got mad over the Sonic the Hedgehog movie because

182
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:24,240
he bought into the whole console war thing of the 90s so hard that here we are 25 years

183
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,700
later and he's still going on about it.

184
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,200
The nice, normal people of the world still haven't forgiven me for being born.

185
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,680
I don't know how common Moviebob's sentiment is among millennials, but if it was at least

186
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,280
somewhat common, I wouldn't be surprised.

187
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,660
It kind of fits into the whole perpetual victimhood thing, you know?

188
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,640
But this is not a video about Moviebob.

189
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,820
I'm sure that will come one day, but for now we have to move on.

190
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,680
How many of you recall this comic floating around the Twittersphere about a year ago?

191
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,520
Wow, that 90s movie I used to love is on Netflix!

192
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,520
Haha, cool, I haven't seen this in years, let's watch it.

193
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,860
Oh, gross, that was really sexist.

194
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,640
That seemed kinda racist.

195
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,120
I don't remember this movie being so homophobic.

196
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,220
I guess I forgot all about this transphobia.

197
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,720
The 90s sucked.

198
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,240
I know at some point I'm going to have to do a much more in-depth look at the whole

199
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,740
erasing of culture that millennial leftists seem to be engaging in right now.

200
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:30,240
And I know it's not just movies on Netflix or whatever, it's also statues and stuff like

201
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
that.

202
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,100
They basically want to erase all of culture, and I'll have something more in-depth to say

203
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,900
about that at a future time.

204
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,920
But I brought this comic up for a very specific reason.

205
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,000
And no, it's not because the author self-insert is, once again, quite unattractive looking.

206
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,300
I don't know why people draw themselves this unattractively.

207
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,480
Of course, the hentai variant of it kinda fixed that.

208
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,000
I can't scroll any further down though because this video would instantly be yeeted off YouTube

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,320
into oblivion.

210
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,560
No, it was because in some ways, and it's going to sound strange but hear me out, in

211
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,560
some ways the millennials have become their own boomers.

212
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,040
Here's what I mean by that.

213
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,020
Earlier we talked about all the ways that millennials were destroying things, they were

214
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:20,000
destroying industries back in 2010 or 2012 or 2015, back when they were all young and

215
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,160
fresh-faced and in college.

216
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,240
But now that they're 30, or they're 35, they have some grey hair coming in, they have kids,

217
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,120
they've stopped partying so much, they're putting some money away, they're working a

218
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,960
regular 9-5, they're selling out basically.

219
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,320
Now that millennials have become the establishment that they protested 10 or 15 years ago, they

220
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,040
are saying about Gen Z the exact same stuff that was said about them, and was even said

221
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,400
about Gen X back when Gen X was young.

222
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:53,020
From Vice Magazine's power and privilege issue, the hot new Gen Z trend is skipping college.

223
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,400
High schoolers are weighing the benefits of blue-collar trades at a time when well-paying

224
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,160
jobs and no debt are hard to pass up.

225
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,000
Oh no, they're not going to our degree farms.

226
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,960
How will we indoctrinate the next generation with mandatory gender studies classes?

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,320
Do you have white teenage sons?

228
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
Listen up.

229
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,400
How white supremacists are recruiting boys online.

230
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,000
Oh no, white supremacy is coming through the ethernet cables.

231
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,480
This is from the ADL.

232
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
This is not a game.

233
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,080
How steam harbors extremists.

234
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,120
And it's basically a pamphlet on how if your son or daughter has a steam account, they're

235
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,080
playing video games on their computers, they're probably Nazis.

236
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,880
And speaking of Nazis, this is from the Washington Post.

237
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,600
Nazi flag displayed in high school window prompts anger and an investigation.

238
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,560
Now those of you who have not forgotten what it's like to be a kid or a teenager or just

239
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,080
a troublemaker, I guess, what does it sound like?

240
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,800
It sounds like a prank.

241
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,440
It sounds like a joke, doesn't it?

242
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,840
It sounds like some kids who, by the way, aren't Nazis understand that the Nazi flag

243
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,540
riles people up, especially old boomers.

244
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,120
So they put it in the window.

245
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,260
They were explicitly irreverent.

246
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,440
They were being edgy just for the sake of it.

247
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,360
But as it turns out, they're not riling up boomers anymore.

248
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,080
They're riling up millennials.

249
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,460
This is before my time.

250
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,420
But back in the 80s, there was definitely a campaign against Dungeons and Dragons.

251
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:18,500
The idea was that if you played tabletop, you're part of some kind of satanic cult.

252
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,080
Back when Elvis was popular, they said the same thing about him and the Beatles.

253
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,700
They did it for rock and roll.

254
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,400
They did it for video games.

255
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,680
When the Columbine school shooters did their thing back in 1999, the media blamed the shooting

256
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,300
on the fact that it was discovered that these two kids had a copy of Doom in their house.

257
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,000
And even when that shooting happened, Doom was old news, man.

258
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,100
The first Doom came out in 1993.

259
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:46,560
It was very clearly a case of an older generation not fully understanding a younger generation

260
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,340
and simply slapping pieces together and seeing what stuck.

261
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,060
In the early 2000s, Jack Chick comics went viral.

262
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:57,080
These were basically just little comics that were handed out by religious people talking

263
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,140
about all the dangerous, sinful things that young people get into nowadays.

264
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,220
This image is probably the most popular one just because of the ridiculousness on this

265
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,220
woman's face.

266
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,700
And it's about D&D.

267
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:13,500
My point is millennials, and to a lesser extent, Gen Xers, were demonized for decades for every

268
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:19,500
single thing that they did by a generation of people who had no idea what their kids

269
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:25,340
were actually doing, what they were actually demonizing them for, and what they were scapegoating.

270
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,660
Didn't matter if it was blood and mortal combat.

271
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,940
Didn't matter if it was Dungeons and Dragons having satanic imagery.

272
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,900
Didn't matter if it was rap music and the explicit lyrics.

273
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,900
Didn't matter.

274
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,580
They disapproved based on their sensibilities and then turned around and said the kids today,

275
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,580
their kids, had gone wrong.

276
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,040
And to a young millennial who was in high school in the year 2001 or something, these

277
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,100
people were laughing stocks.

278
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,640
The ones that were floating around for me specifically in high school were like, one,

279
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,660
the whole rainbow cock thing where basically girls would put on different types of lipstick

280
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:04,300
and then go give guys blowjobs and if a guy got every color on his dick, he won or something.

281
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,700
And then secondly, Jenkim.

282
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,900
And Jenkim was a big meme in 2007 where basically kids would basically just take shit, like

283
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:16,380
fermented human shit, put it in a bottle, let it bubble up, and then breathe the gases

284
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,560
to get high.

285
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,020
The problem is both of these instances, they might have happened a little bit, but they

286
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,220
were never widespread.

287
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:29,020
The stories, the rumors, were always jokes that people my age were playing on the boomers.

288
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,700
We said this shit was happening and then they would write articles about it and it would

289
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,480
be a big fucking laugh.

290
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,780
And now the millennials, I guess because they're just too stupid or they're too politically

291
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:45,780
driven nowadays or something, they don't understand that Gen Z is doing the exact same thing to

292
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,780
them.

293
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:52,500
Like with the whole okay hand symbol being a symbol of racism or white milk or something.

294
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,380
These are things that kids on 4chan pushed and millennials, forgetting the fact that

295
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,620
they were once young, ate that shit up and believed it.

296
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,020
Or there's the whole Hawaiian shirt thing happening right now.

297
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,380
Oh, the Boogaloo boys, they're wearing Hawaiian shirts like it's Miami Vice or something.

298
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,020
Walking around with their guns talking about starting a civil war.

299
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,580
Oh my God, we have to do something.

300
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:17,700
Oh my God, kids are throwing coronavirus parties where whoever catches the virus wins.

301
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,740
We have to stop it.

302
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,080
Our kids are going crazy.

303
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,280
And here's that article written by Faith Karimi and Jameel Lynch on CNN.

304
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,700
Jesus, that's an unfortunate last name.

305
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,240
But here's the LinkedIn account of the two people involved.

306
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,760
Now I've got a way to view LinkedIn accounts without actually being logged into LinkedIn

307
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,580
because LinkedIn is a fucking cancer zone.

308
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,500
So sorry if it looks a little bit strange, but it is accurate.

309
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:47,420
So Jameel Lynch, she's the national desk editor for CNN since October, 2016.

310
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,900
She worked for Fox, she worked for KUSA TV, KC TV.

311
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,920
She was ABC 7 Chicago back in 2006.

312
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,000
She had a few small jobs working her way up.

313
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,380
And then from 2001 to 2006, she got her BA in television writing and producing at the

314
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,500
Columbia College.

315
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,900
Well, okay.

316
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,940
So she is probably about four or five years older than me.

317
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,740
That puts her squarely as a millennial.

318
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,420
Here's Faith Karimi.

319
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:21,620
She's desk editor at CNN since 2009, Baltimore Sun at 2006, and before that she was at Grambling

320
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,740
State University to get her master's in journalism and mass communications.

321
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,340
So again, probably around the same age.

322
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,340
Millennial.

323
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,440
These two are old enough to remember pranking their teachers back during the era where being

324
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,220
a prankster was considered one of the great things for kids to do, you know, the MTV era,

325
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,460
the jackass era.

326
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,980
And here they are writing articles about this nonsense.

327
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,740
Millennials have almost forgotten what it was like to be children.

328
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,120
And I know that happens eventually as you as you grow up, which is kind of how it is.

329
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,860
But like, I never expected them to become boomers themselves.

330
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:00,420
I never expected something like no pixels for fascists to come out of out of millennial

331
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,700
thought maligning gamers and YouTubers as fascist enablers.

332
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:10,260
This is the kind of stuff that you'd see Jack Thompson do back in the late 90s.

333
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,860
Trying to have video games censored because they didn't meet his moral sensibilities.

334
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,340
My generation is getting old.

335
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:21,500
And considering that they're tied with the boomers and being the most entitled spoiled

336
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,140
generation that's ever come along with the only difference being a superficial swing

337
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,540
leftward instead of a superficial swing rightward for the boomers.

338
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:34,460
I am not surprised that as millennials, you know, hit the late 20s, early 30s, some of

339
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,460
them are probably approaching 40 at this point.

340
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,940
I am not surprised that they are morphing into authoritarians just like the boomers

341
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,940
did.

342
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,500
I am not surprised that they are hypocritical, wasteful, closed minded, ignorant, with the

343
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,820
only difference being that they slap a left wing coat of paint on it instead of a right

344
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,580
wing coat like their parents.

345
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:58,380
But most importantly of all, I think, is that unlike the boomers, the millennials were so

346
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,880
spoiled that they actually grew up believing they would never get old.

347
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,260
The spotlight would always be on them.

348
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,500
They would always be the arbiter of what is new and cool.

349
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,540
That mindset explains takes like this.

350
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:16,560
The best that can come of coronavirus is elderly conservatives all die, the billionaires get

351
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,740
their backs to the wall, the economy collapses and is reborn like a phoenix from its ashes

352
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:27,140
as a socialist economy, and millennials emerge from quarantine horny as fuck and start making

353
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,140
babies.

354
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,660
They legitimately want what is considered to be old, decrepit.

355
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:37,780
Not just old people, but old history, old styles of thought, old ideas, to be swept

356
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,860
away, to be violently swept away in fact.

357
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:46,580
To be forcefully destroyed if necessary, to make breathing room for the millennials.

358
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,780
And they are doing this because they genuinely can't conceive of a future, by the way the

359
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:56,840
only possible future, where one day they are old, and one day they will be swept aside

360
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,340
by the younger generation.

361
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,940
But that is what getting old is all about.

362
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,560
It happens to everyone.

363
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,720
One day I'll be dead.

364
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,600
One day everyone I know, everyone I care about, will be dead.

365
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,720
One day you will be dead, as well as everyone you care about too.

366
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,060
On some level life is fundamentally a tragedy.

367
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:21,700
Right now there is an intense hatred of the older generations, and it's a hatred that

368
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,280
I've experienced and remember quite fondly during my time as an SJW, I've made a video

369
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,620
about that if you want to go watch that.

370
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:34,380
But basically, I remember thinking, oh those old people, how could they be so backward,

371
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,900
how could they think like this, how could they behave like this?

372
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,600
And you know what, on some level I was right, there are definitely objectionable things

373
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,280
that old people do, because they just don't know any better, and we've actually found

374
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,860
better ways to do things.

375
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:50,380
But I don't think that that's a moral justification for legitimate hatred, to actually wanting

376
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,680
to wipe out the boomers or something.

377
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,340
But yeah, our current culture does revolve around the youth experience, you know, all

378
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,500
the stories are like young adult adventures, they're in high school or they're in their

379
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,820
twenties and they're going off to have some kind of grand adventure in their young years.

380
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,820
During all these formative times in their life, romance is considered to be the domain

381
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,100
of the young.

382
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,380
Schooling and learning are things that young people are expected to do, but not old people.

383
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,220
There is definitely this focus on the younger experience, and I think that that's basically

384
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:24,380
culminated in the millennial mindset, this idea that they will never be out of style,

385
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,580
they will never be what's not cool.

386
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:31,380
But I mean, millennials are having kids now, and to those kids, their parents are definitely

387
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,700
what's not cool.

388
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,860
At this point, I'm just kind of rambling, so let me get to my thesis here.

389
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:40,560
I believe that the modernist lifestyle that my generation has been raised into, and this

390
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,100
is not a full critique of modernism, there's a lot of great things about the modern material

391
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,300
world, I would not have it any other way, but one of its major drawbacks is the fact

392
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:54,220
that I think millennials are generally spiritually stunted, doesn't mean they have to be religious,

393
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,220
the religion can help, but they definitely don't believe in anything beyond the physical.

394
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,500
They believe that the entire human experience can be quantified by science as biology or

395
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,360
something, which is actually quite funny, because whenever you talk about trans issues,

396
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,820
they'll call you a biological essentialist, as if that's a bad thing.

397
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:17,340
They'll completely deny human nature in a lot of ways, but yet they still invoke biology

398
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,180
when it comes to the human experience, it's quite strange.

399
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:24,860
Nonetheless, to them, there is no spiritual, there is no meaning, it's all just tricks

400
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,220
of the mind, and you know, maybe it is on a practical level, but that kind of thinking

401
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,900
certainly leads to the existential depression that a lot of millennials seem to be facing

402
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,280
right now, and the way that they deal with that is they become radically self-centered,

403
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,080
and they spent decades within the culture of youth having that reinforced.

404
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,520
So yes, they were screwed by the boomers, but they're also massively entitled as well.

405
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,860
Both of these things are true, but age is creeping up on the millennials now.

406
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,620
They don't see it, or they're blinded to it, or they're purposely trying not to look,

407
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,620
but it's happening.

408
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:59,980
And if we had to define the source of, I guess we could call it millennial rage, it would

409
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:05,140
not be the economy, it would not be capitalism, it would not necessarily be the boomers, though

410
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:09,700
I do think their rage towards those things are symptoms of the larger problem, but the

411
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,040
source is their own mortality.

412
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:18,460
They grew up experiencing such abundance, and in an environment and culture that centered

413
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:24,460
them so much for so long, causing the extended adolescence man-child phenomenon in some cases,

414
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:29,700
that they have no idea how to deal with the fact that they're old, that they're getting

415
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,080
old, that they'll die one day.

416
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,900
They haven't yet fully realized that when they were in school thinking their teacher

417
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,940
was an old man, that's the age they are now.

418
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,900
They haven't yet fully realized that no, they're no longer 21, and therefore thinking an 18-year-old

419
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,180
girl is hot is kind of weird now.

420
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,620
Maybe this explains all the social justice apologetics for pedophilia that we're seeing

421
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,620
right now.

422
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:55,140
And of course, because of all of this, they definitely can't understand that when the

423
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,060
younger generation rebels against them, and decides to piss them off a little bit just

424
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:03,460
for the sake of pissing them off, that no, they're not actually being radicalized to

425
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:08,000
be Nazis or white supremacists or the alt-right or something ridiculous like that.

426
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,540
They're just being edgy.

427
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,020
They can't see that because they think they're still young.

428
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,620
They think, oh no, we're the ones being edgy by being far left.

429
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,260
People know things have changed.

430
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:21,540
Within the next 10 years, I expect a lot of the millennials to start going absolutely

431
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,540
apeshit as they realize that they're 45 with gray hair.

432
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,460
They're thinking of buying that sports car as their midlife crisis, that they are in

433
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,580
essence the dads that they hate.

434
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,580
And you know what?

435
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,820
So far, I've been mostly talking like this doesn't apply to me.

436
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,820
I don't think so.

437
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,820
It absolutely does apply to me.

438
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,820
I'm getting old too.

439
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:42,000
I am at least somewhat determined not to get old as I get older, meaning that I'm still

440
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,480
going to at least be open to new ideas.

441
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,520
But I do think that true maturity is balancing both the young and the old.

442
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,640
It's not simply believing blindly that you are a teenager when you're obviously not,

443
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,280
but it's also not giving up your passions like a lot of, you know, boomer style adults

444
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,280
do.

445
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,400
And ironically enough, I think that's actually the best way to avoid getting old.

446
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,720
You don't cling to this identity, this notion that you are the youth because that just leads

447
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,720
you to becoming insular, isolated, basically boomers.

448
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,680
Like all the examples we've talked about today.

449
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:19,480
But you do recognize that even as you age, you can still enjoy your life.

450
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,140
Understand who you are and where you are, both in place and in time.

451
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,280
But don't let that sour the things that you truly love.

452
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,960
I think that's how you stay young.

453
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,920
And that's something I'm going to try to do.

454
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,040
Anyway, sorry for the very long rant.

455
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,520
This is coming out on July 4th.

456
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,440
So if you pop over to my Twitch stream pretty much right now as the video goes up, I'm going

457
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,560
to be playing an appropriately themed America July 4th game.

458
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,780
So please check it out.

459
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,520
That's twitch.tv slash game boomers.

460
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,420
And hey, if you don't want to, that's fine, too.

461
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,440
I'll see you tomorrow for the weekly sip.

462
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,640
I love you guys.

463
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,840
And remember, stay young.
