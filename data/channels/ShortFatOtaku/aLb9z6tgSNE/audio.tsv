0	5720	Yes, I know this is not the Chaz video, but unironically I do have it on the way.
5720	9280	It is in the pipeline, it's in the render queue as Spoonie would say.
9280	11920	No really, check my editing drive.
11920	18080	Here's two hours of raw commentary and another ten minutes of addendums once some new stories
18080	19240	came out about it.
19240	24120	The only thing I'm waiting on now is to see if any of those arrests from yesterday materialize
24120	25280	into a news story.
25280	29280	I'll tack that onto the video and then I'll release it, so you'll probably see it Monday
29280	30880	or Tuesday or something.
30880	34040	Sorry it's taken this long, but really, I am working on it.
34040	38520	But I'm doing this video because I've realized something.
38520	43800	Over the past dozen, maybe twenty videos or so that I've done on this channel, I've noticed
43800	45000	a trend.
45000	49160	And the trend basically amounts to the fact that I'm getting old.
49160	51680	I'm referencing past political paradigms.
51680	56780	I'm talking about the 2012 or 2008 elections as if they're at least somewhat new.
56780	61280	I'm still disappointed that the left is not the left of the 90s, the left that I was a
61280	62280	part of.
62280	64620	I am slowly becoming an old man.
64620	65620	And you know what?
65620	68100	I'm not too insecure about it just yet.
68100	71680	I'm sure everybody on some level is insecure about them getting old.
71680	75340	And I would be lying to you if I said that it never ever bothered me.
75340	80300	But I've realized that some of the political experiences I've discussed, some of the people
80300	84380	who watch me don't share those experiences and it's primarily due to age.
84380	88820	For example, the N64 was my big console of choice when I was a kid.
88820	91020	That was kind of the era that I came from.
91020	96180	Meanwhile, if you're 20 right now listening to this video, you grew up with the Wii.
96180	100980	And that's kind of wild for me to think about because I picked up the Wii in my first year
100980	102300	of university.
102300	107060	That was like my university console, the Wii PS3 360 era.
107060	110700	And yes, you can tell exactly what kind of person that I am because I'm judging era based
110700	113200	on game console generation.
113200	116520	But still though, the Wii feels at least a little bit new to me.
116520	119840	It certainly doesn't feel like it's a classic console or anything, but some of you grew
119840	121340	up with that console as kids.
121340	125580	Some of you had it as the console that you played on when you were nine or 10 years old.
125580	128560	Some of you went through your formative years with the Wii.
128560	133760	It's kind of funny because, you know, in the early 2000s, millennials would get a whole
133760	134760	lot of shit.
134760	135760	And I'm a millennial.
135760	140360	They were considered to be ridiculously left-wing, like to the point that when the first crowd
140360	144760	of them came out of the universities, they were considered near unemployable because
144760	150280	they were all basically spoiled children with a hyped up sense of self-importance, like
150280	155360	the whole indigo child thing, the special snowflake, you know, that was my generation.
155360	159760	I'm not surprised that we spawned the Occupy movement back in 2009 or whatever it was,
159760	164680	which was large and loud, but ultimately disorganized and completely fell apart because people there
164680	167240	had no idea what they were doing or what they were fighting for.
167320	170840	And you know what, now that I'm thinking of it, I will say one thing about that era.
170840	175840	At the very least, Obama's Democrats knew to like silently distance themselves from
175840	179040	Occupy while the Republicans openly opposed it.
179040	183760	At least they didn't full on embrace revolutionary communism like they're doing now.
183760	188740	But the big joke for a long time is that millennials, due to their largely different habits from
188740	192400	Gen Xers and Boomers, were destroying the American economy.
192400	196880	And it was in fact a meme for a long time, just all of the things millennials were ruining.
196880	198160	There's a list here.
198160	200840	Millennials are killing the beer industry.
200840	204120	Millennials are killing chains like Buffalo Wild Wings and Apple Bees.
204120	206160	Sorry, Sargon.
206160	209360	Psychologically scarred millennials are killing dozens of industries and it's their parents'
209360	210880	fault.
210880	213480	Millennials are killing the napkin industry.
213480	215600	Millennials are killing the golf industry.
215600	218520	Are millennials killing the car industry?
218520	221860	Will millennials kill home ownership?
221860	225800	Millennials could be a problem for America's most iconic motorcycle brand.
225800	228160	Millennials are killing the 9-5 work week.
228160	229880	They're killing focus groups.
229880	231680	They're killing dinner dates.
231680	236480	And just in general, millennials are killing it.
236480	238680	And there's certainly some critique to be had here.
238680	241280	The way that the Boomers lived was ridiculous.
241280	243380	It was entirely non-sustainable.
243380	247040	They inherited a post-war economy that they had little to do with actually building.
247040	248520	It was their parents generally.
248520	251240	They did a whole bunch of exploiting and selling out.
251240	255080	And in a lot of instances, they're refusing to move aside to allow the next generation
255080	256840	to come through.
256840	262760	I think this is why the whole OK Boomer thing was that short-lived meme for a while.
262760	266560	Because frankly, the way that Boomers have behaved has been pretty reprehensible.
266560	270480	Boomers make up the majority of both the neo-cons and the neo-libs.
270480	274920	They make up primarily both the bankers and corporatists that the far left complains about,
274920	279300	as well as the globalists and career politicians that the far right complains about.
279300	284200	So this idea that millennials are refusing to live like Boomers and the Boomers are getting
284200	286720	worried about it, yeah, it's kind of funny.
286720	287960	I'm not gonna lie.
287960	291200	But we can't lay everything at the feet of the Boomers.
291200	292200	Certainly not.
292200	296680	In many ways, the millennials are just as entitled as the Boomers claim they are.
296680	301160	Of course, the Boomers raised them to be that way, but that's another topic in a sense.
301160	302280	They're still entitled.
302280	304120	And they're not kids anymore, all right?
304120	307600	People are still posting like, man, all those millennials are going out and partying and
307600	308600	having a good time.
308600	309600	Dude, millennials are like 30.
309600	310600	They're 35 now.
310600	312120	Some of them are even 40, I think.
312120	314080	At this point, millennials are sellouts.
314080	316080	However, they're not corporate sellouts.
316080	317560	They're political sellouts.
317560	322600	They're grasping onto fringe destructive theories like socialism because basically they have
322600	325520	nothing left and they feel like their parents have robbed it from them.
325520	328920	It's a strange paradigm because there's a lot of spoiled university kids out there who
328920	334440	have been indoctrinated to hate their parents, mostly by their really shitty Marxist university
334440	335440	teachers.
335440	339080	But at the same time, there are definitely a lot of reasons to hate your average Boomer.
339080	342760	And I'm sure some of those people actually do have shitty parents.
342760	344040	Like check out this take for a minute.
344040	345840	I know this is a far left take.
345840	350580	This comes from Rami, I'm a progressive Muslim who never drinks and never has sex, but got
350580	353680	drunk and fucked Zoe Quinn in a hotel room, Ismail.
353680	357160	Big deal in the indie game dev world and also very far left.
357160	360780	And despite that, at least some of this rings true, doesn't it?
360780	363800	Millennials tell us the one thing they'd bring back from childhood.
363800	369580	He replies with opportunity, democracy, privacy, ice caps, affordable education, rent, an actual
369580	373320	job economy instead of a gig economy, hope, Napster.
373320	376920	We can definitely lay some of this at the feet of the boomers for sure.
376920	379400	But Rami, you're a millennial like me.
379400	380840	We are not children anymore.
380840	382820	We are in fact getting old.
382820	384800	And some of this is our fault.
384800	389520	There are opportunities out there, but it does seem like on some level millennials do
389520	391680	not want to chase after them.
391680	393280	They want things handed to them.
393280	396520	Maybe it's because they saw that things were generally handed to the boomers, and they
396520	398440	thought that's what life should be.
398440	400020	But the boomers were an exception.
400020	401840	Who is it that's eroding democracy?
401840	402840	Really?
402840	403840	Who?
403840	404840	Who is it?
404840	406820	I know that you think it's the dreaded far right.
406820	411600	But considering that the left has been co-opted by revolutionary communists, I think democracy
411600	415920	would begin to disappear if somebody that you endorsed ever held real power.
415920	416920	Privacy.
416920	417920	Okay.
417920	420080	Isn't that being eroded by far left corporations?
420080	422640	I know you think that's an oxymoron, but it really isn't.
422640	427700	You have these corporations pushing progressive values, becoming ever more globalist.
427700	430880	And by the way, there's certainly a leftist element to globalism, you know, the whole
430880	432500	worldwide communism thing.
432500	436560	The radical left might complain about big tech taking away privacy, but they still want
436560	440000	that big tech cartel to be empowered because they control it.
440000	443080	And I could keep going on this list, but I don't want this video to be hours and hours
443080	444080	long.
444080	448160	The point is, Rami, and to basically every other lefty millennial out there, we're not
448160	449160	kids anymore.
449160	452240	We're not playing our Super Nintendos in the basement at five years old or whatever the
452840	453840	case may be.
453840	458200	We are adults now, we're responsible for our lives, and a lot of this stuff can in fact
458200	459200	be laid at our feet.
459200	463320	And as a quick aside, if you ever wanted to see somebody who's really stuck in the past,
463320	465040	just go look at Moviebob's feet.
465040	471520	The right wing has an abject, roiling, seething hatred for smart, driven, creative people,
471520	473680	but not even as they exist now.
473680	477720	It's an unresolved residual hatred of the younger incarnations they remember from school
477720	482400	age, or more likely, a bitterness at the idea that they grew up to be something.
482400	486880	Bob, I know that you're talking about your political opponents, but it really sounds
486880	489240	like you're talking about yourself here, man.
489240	491800	You may need to let the past go a little bit.
491800	494520	I know you were probably bullied, hell, I was bullied.
494520	496600	I had a lot of enemies in grade school.
496600	501240	It was a time when it was not yet cool to play video games, it was not yet common to
501240	506120	play video games, so if you were a gamer, you were ostracized by basically half the
506120	509920	school year because you were not one of the cool kids, you were not one of the athletic
509920	512360	kids, you were not one of the charismatic kids.
512360	516200	You were certainly made fun of by all the girls as well, and your choice of friend was
516200	518800	basically, does this guy like games?
518800	522160	Okay, I guess we're friends because there's no one else.
522160	525600	Moviebob's a little bit older than me, but I think we had a similar experience, at least
525600	527600	when it comes to video games in school.
527600	528600	And you know what?
528600	529600	I kind of get what he's saying.
529600	533000	Whenever I think back on the bullies of my childhood, I still have that little bit of
533000	538120	twinge, that little knee-jerk reaction of, oh yeah, that guy was an asshole, fuck him.
538120	540980	And maybe the person still is an asshole, maybe he's not.
540980	544080	Maybe if I looked one of them up on Facebook, they'd be a regular person.
544080	548580	I still have no desire to go and interact with them now, I've moved on.
548580	551080	But that's the point, is that I've moved on.
551080	553240	Bob, you may need to move on.
553240	557720	Remember, this is coming from a guy who got mad over the Sonic the Hedgehog movie because
557720	564240	he bought into the whole console war thing of the 90s so hard that here we are 25 years
564240	566700	later and he's still going on about it.
566700	572200	The nice, normal people of the world still haven't forgiven me for being born.
572200	578680	I don't know how common Moviebob's sentiment is among millennials, but if it was at least
578680	581280	somewhat common, I wouldn't be surprised.
581280	585660	It kind of fits into the whole perpetual victimhood thing, you know?
585660	587640	But this is not a video about Moviebob.
587640	590820	I'm sure that will come one day, but for now we have to move on.
590820	594680	How many of you recall this comic floating around the Twittersphere about a year ago?
594680	597520	Wow, that 90s movie I used to love is on Netflix!
597520	601520	Haha, cool, I haven't seen this in years, let's watch it.
601520	604860	Oh, gross, that was really sexist.
604860	606640	That seemed kinda racist.
606640	609120	I don't remember this movie being so homophobic.
609120	612220	I guess I forgot all about this transphobia.
612220	613720	The 90s sucked.
613720	619240	I know at some point I'm going to have to do a much more in-depth look at the whole
619240	623740	erasing of culture that millennial leftists seem to be engaging in right now.
623740	630240	And I know it's not just movies on Netflix or whatever, it's also statues and stuff like
630240	631240	that.
631240	634100	They basically want to erase all of culture, and I'll have something more in-depth to say
634100	635900	about that at a future time.
635900	638920	But I brought this comic up for a very specific reason.
638920	644000	And no, it's not because the author self-insert is, once again, quite unattractive looking.
644000	647300	I don't know why people draw themselves this unattractively.
647300	651480	Of course, the hentai variant of it kinda fixed that.
651480	657000	I can't scroll any further down though because this video would instantly be yeeted off YouTube
657000	658320	into oblivion.
658320	664560	No, it was because in some ways, and it's going to sound strange but hear me out, in
664560	668560	some ways the millennials have become their own boomers.
668560	670040	Here's what I mean by that.
670040	674020	Earlier we talked about all the ways that millennials were destroying things, they were
674020	680000	destroying industries back in 2010 or 2012 or 2015, back when they were all young and
680000	682160	fresh-faced and in college.
682160	687240	But now that they're 30, or they're 35, they have some grey hair coming in, they have kids,
687240	691120	they've stopped partying so much, they're putting some money away, they're working a
691120	693960	regular 9-5, they're selling out basically.
693960	698320	Now that millennials have become the establishment that they protested 10 or 15 years ago, they
698320	704040	are saying about Gen Z the exact same stuff that was said about them, and was even said
704040	706400	about Gen X back when Gen X was young.
706400	713020	From Vice Magazine's power and privilege issue, the hot new Gen Z trend is skipping college.
713020	717400	High schoolers are weighing the benefits of blue-collar trades at a time when well-paying
717400	720160	jobs and no debt are hard to pass up.
720160	723000	Oh no, they're not going to our degree farms.
723000	726960	How will we indoctrinate the next generation with mandatory gender studies classes?
727000	729320	Do you have white teenage sons?
729320	730320	Listen up.
730320	733400	How white supremacists are recruiting boys online.
733400	737000	Oh no, white supremacy is coming through the ethernet cables.
737000	738480	This is from the ADL.
738480	739480	This is not a game.
739480	741080	How steam harbors extremists.
741080	745120	And it's basically a pamphlet on how if your son or daughter has a steam account, they're
745120	749080	playing video games on their computers, they're probably Nazis.
749080	751880	And speaking of Nazis, this is from the Washington Post.
751880	756600	Nazi flag displayed in high school window prompts anger and an investigation.
756600	762560	Now those of you who have not forgotten what it's like to be a kid or a teenager or just
762560	765080	a troublemaker, I guess, what does it sound like?
765080	767800	It sounds like a prank.
767800	770440	It sounds like a joke, doesn't it?
770440	774840	It sounds like some kids who, by the way, aren't Nazis understand that the Nazi flag
774840	777540	riles people up, especially old boomers.
777540	779120	So they put it in the window.
779120	781260	They were explicitly irreverent.
781260	783440	They were being edgy just for the sake of it.
783440	786360	But as it turns out, they're not riling up boomers anymore.
786360	788080	They're riling up millennials.
788080	789460	This is before my time.
789460	793420	But back in the 80s, there was definitely a campaign against Dungeons and Dragons.
793420	798500	The idea was that if you played tabletop, you're part of some kind of satanic cult.
798500	802080	Back when Elvis was popular, they said the same thing about him and the Beatles.
802080	803700	They did it for rock and roll.
803700	805400	They did it for video games.
805400	810680	When the Columbine school shooters did their thing back in 1999, the media blamed the shooting
810680	815300	on the fact that it was discovered that these two kids had a copy of Doom in their house.
815300	818000	And even when that shooting happened, Doom was old news, man.
818000	820100	The first Doom came out in 1993.
820100	826560	It was very clearly a case of an older generation not fully understanding a younger generation
826560	829340	and simply slapping pieces together and seeing what stuck.
829340	833060	In the early 2000s, Jack Chick comics went viral.
833060	837080	These were basically just little comics that were handed out by religious people talking
837080	841140	about all the dangerous, sinful things that young people get into nowadays.
841140	844220	This image is probably the most popular one just because of the ridiculousness on this
844220	845220	woman's face.
845220	846700	And it's about D&D.
846700	853500	My point is millennials, and to a lesser extent, Gen Xers, were demonized for decades for every
853500	859500	single thing that they did by a generation of people who had no idea what their kids
859500	865340	were actually doing, what they were actually demonizing them for, and what they were scapegoating.
865340	867660	Didn't matter if it was blood and mortal combat.
867660	870940	Didn't matter if it was Dungeons and Dragons having satanic imagery.
870940	873900	Didn't matter if it was rap music and the explicit lyrics.
873900	874900	Didn't matter.
874900	879580	They disapproved based on their sensibilities and then turned around and said the kids today,
879580	881580	their kids, had gone wrong.
881580	886040	And to a young millennial who was in high school in the year 2001 or something, these
886040	888100	people were laughing stocks.
888100	892640	The ones that were floating around for me specifically in high school were like, one,
892640	897660	the whole rainbow cock thing where basically girls would put on different types of lipstick
897660	904300	and then go give guys blowjobs and if a guy got every color on his dick, he won or something.
904300	905700	And then secondly, Jenkim.
905700	910900	And Jenkim was a big meme in 2007 where basically kids would basically just take shit, like
910900	916380	fermented human shit, put it in a bottle, let it bubble up, and then breathe the gases
916380	917560	to get high.
917560	922020	The problem is both of these instances, they might have happened a little bit, but they
922020	923220	were never widespread.
923220	929020	The stories, the rumors, were always jokes that people my age were playing on the boomers.
929020	932700	We said this shit was happening and then they would write articles about it and it would
932700	934480	be a big fucking laugh.
934480	939780	And now the millennials, I guess because they're just too stupid or they're too politically
939780	945780	driven nowadays or something, they don't understand that Gen Z is doing the exact same thing to
945780	946780	them.
946780	952500	Like with the whole okay hand symbol being a symbol of racism or white milk or something.
952500	957380	These are things that kids on 4chan pushed and millennials, forgetting the fact that
957380	960620	they were once young, ate that shit up and believed it.
960620	963020	Or there's the whole Hawaiian shirt thing happening right now.
963020	968380	Oh, the Boogaloo boys, they're wearing Hawaiian shirts like it's Miami Vice or something.
968380	971020	Walking around with their guns talking about starting a civil war.
971020	972580	Oh my God, we have to do something.
972580	977700	Oh my God, kids are throwing coronavirus parties where whoever catches the virus wins.
977700	978740	We have to stop it.
978740	980080	Our kids are going crazy.
980080	985280	And here's that article written by Faith Karimi and Jameel Lynch on CNN.
985280	988700	Jesus, that's an unfortunate last name.
988700	991240	But here's the LinkedIn account of the two people involved.
991240	995760	Now I've got a way to view LinkedIn accounts without actually being logged into LinkedIn
995760	998580	because LinkedIn is a fucking cancer zone.
998580	1001500	So sorry if it looks a little bit strange, but it is accurate.
1001500	1007420	So Jameel Lynch, she's the national desk editor for CNN since October, 2016.
1007420	1010900	She worked for Fox, she worked for KUSA TV, KC TV.
1010900	1014920	She was ABC 7 Chicago back in 2006.
1014920	1018000	She had a few small jobs working her way up.
1018000	1024380	And then from 2001 to 2006, she got her BA in television writing and producing at the
1024380	1025500	Columbia College.
1025500	1026900	Well, okay.
1026900	1030940	So she is probably about four or five years older than me.
1030940	1032740	That puts her squarely as a millennial.
1032740	1034420	Here's Faith Karimi.
1034420	1041620	She's desk editor at CNN since 2009, Baltimore Sun at 2006, and before that she was at Grambling
1041620	1045740	State University to get her master's in journalism and mass communications.
1045740	1048340	So again, probably around the same age.
1048340	1049340	Millennial.
1049340	1054440	These two are old enough to remember pranking their teachers back during the era where being
1054440	1060220	a prankster was considered one of the great things for kids to do, you know, the MTV era,
1060220	1061460	the jackass era.
1061460	1064980	And here they are writing articles about this nonsense.
1064980	1067740	Millennials have almost forgotten what it was like to be children.
1067740	1071120	And I know that happens eventually as you as you grow up, which is kind of how it is.
1071120	1074860	But like, I never expected them to become boomers themselves.
1074860	1080420	I never expected something like no pixels for fascists to come out of out of millennial
1080420	1084700	thought maligning gamers and YouTubers as fascist enablers.
1084700	1090260	This is the kind of stuff that you'd see Jack Thompson do back in the late 90s.
1090260	1094860	Trying to have video games censored because they didn't meet his moral sensibilities.
1094860	1096340	My generation is getting old.
1096340	1101500	And considering that they're tied with the boomers and being the most entitled spoiled
1101500	1106140	generation that's ever come along with the only difference being a superficial swing
1106140	1109540	leftward instead of a superficial swing rightward for the boomers.
1109540	1114460	I am not surprised that as millennials, you know, hit the late 20s, early 30s, some of
1114460	1116460	them are probably approaching 40 at this point.
1116460	1119940	I am not surprised that they are morphing into authoritarians just like the boomers
1119940	1120940	did.
1120940	1126500	I am not surprised that they are hypocritical, wasteful, closed minded, ignorant, with the
1126500	1130820	only difference being that they slap a left wing coat of paint on it instead of a right
1130820	1132580	wing coat like their parents.
1132580	1138380	But most importantly of all, I think, is that unlike the boomers, the millennials were so
1138380	1142880	spoiled that they actually grew up believing they would never get old.
1142880	1145260	The spotlight would always be on them.
1145260	1148500	They would always be the arbiter of what is new and cool.
1148500	1151540	That mindset explains takes like this.
1151540	1156560	The best that can come of coronavirus is elderly conservatives all die, the billionaires get
1156560	1161740	their backs to the wall, the economy collapses and is reborn like a phoenix from its ashes
1161740	1167140	as a socialist economy, and millennials emerge from quarantine horny as fuck and start making
1167140	1168140	babies.
1168140	1171660	They legitimately want what is considered to be old, decrepit.
1171660	1177780	Not just old people, but old history, old styles of thought, old ideas, to be swept
1177780	1180860	away, to be violently swept away in fact.
1180860	1186580	To be forcefully destroyed if necessary, to make breathing room for the millennials.
1186580	1190780	And they are doing this because they genuinely can't conceive of a future, by the way the
1190780	1196840	only possible future, where one day they are old, and one day they will be swept aside
1196840	1198340	by the younger generation.
1198340	1200940	But that is what getting old is all about.
1200940	1202560	It happens to everyone.
1202560	1204720	One day I'll be dead.
1204720	1208600	One day everyone I know, everyone I care about, will be dead.
1208600	1212720	One day you will be dead, as well as everyone you care about too.
1212720	1216060	On some level life is fundamentally a tragedy.
1216060	1221700	Right now there is an intense hatred of the older generations, and it's a hatred that
1221700	1226280	I've experienced and remember quite fondly during my time as an SJW, I've made a video
1226280	1228620	about that if you want to go watch that.
1228620	1234380	But basically, I remember thinking, oh those old people, how could they be so backward,
1234380	1236900	how could they think like this, how could they behave like this?
1236900	1240600	And you know what, on some level I was right, there are definitely objectionable things
1240600	1244280	that old people do, because they just don't know any better, and we've actually found
1244280	1245860	better ways to do things.
1245860	1250380	But I don't think that that's a moral justification for legitimate hatred, to actually wanting
1250380	1252680	to wipe out the boomers or something.
1252680	1257340	But yeah, our current culture does revolve around the youth experience, you know, all
1257340	1261500	the stories are like young adult adventures, they're in high school or they're in their
1261500	1265820	twenties and they're going off to have some kind of grand adventure in their young years.
1265820	1269820	During all these formative times in their life, romance is considered to be the domain
1269820	1271100	of the young.
1271100	1275380	Schooling and learning are things that young people are expected to do, but not old people.
1275380	1279220	There is definitely this focus on the younger experience, and I think that that's basically
1279220	1284380	culminated in the millennial mindset, this idea that they will never be out of style,
1284380	1286580	they will never be what's not cool.
1286580	1291380	But I mean, millennials are having kids now, and to those kids, their parents are definitely
1291380	1292700	what's not cool.
1292700	1295860	At this point, I'm just kind of rambling, so let me get to my thesis here.
1295860	1300560	I believe that the modernist lifestyle that my generation has been raised into, and this
1300560	1305100	is not a full critique of modernism, there's a lot of great things about the modern material
1305100	1309300	world, I would not have it any other way, but one of its major drawbacks is the fact
1309300	1314220	that I think millennials are generally spiritually stunted, doesn't mean they have to be religious,
1314220	1319220	the religion can help, but they definitely don't believe in anything beyond the physical.
1319220	1324500	They believe that the entire human experience can be quantified by science as biology or
1324500	1328360	something, which is actually quite funny, because whenever you talk about trans issues,
1328360	1331820	they'll call you a biological essentialist, as if that's a bad thing.
1331820	1337340	They'll completely deny human nature in a lot of ways, but yet they still invoke biology
1337340	1340180	when it comes to the human experience, it's quite strange.
1340180	1344860	Nonetheless, to them, there is no spiritual, there is no meaning, it's all just tricks
1344860	1348220	of the mind, and you know, maybe it is on a practical level, but that kind of thinking
1348220	1351900	certainly leads to the existential depression that a lot of millennials seem to be facing
1351900	1356280	right now, and the way that they deal with that is they become radically self-centered,
1356280	1360080	and they spent decades within the culture of youth having that reinforced.
1360080	1364520	So yes, they were screwed by the boomers, but they're also massively entitled as well.
1364520	1368860	Both of these things are true, but age is creeping up on the millennials now.
1369420	1373620	They don't see it, or they're blinded to it, or they're purposely trying not to look,
1373620	1374620	but it's happening.
1374620	1379980	And if we had to define the source of, I guess we could call it millennial rage, it would
1379980	1385140	not be the economy, it would not be capitalism, it would not necessarily be the boomers, though
1385140	1389700	I do think their rage towards those things are symptoms of the larger problem, but the
1389700	1392040	source is their own mortality.
1392040	1398460	They grew up experiencing such abundance, and in an environment and culture that centered
1398460	1404460	them so much for so long, causing the extended adolescence man-child phenomenon in some cases,
1404460	1409700	that they have no idea how to deal with the fact that they're old, that they're getting
1409700	1412080	old, that they'll die one day.
1412080	1415900	They haven't yet fully realized that when they were in school thinking their teacher
1415900	1418940	was an old man, that's the age they are now.
1418940	1424900	They haven't yet fully realized that no, they're no longer 21, and therefore thinking an 18-year-old
1424900	1427180	girl is hot is kind of weird now.
1427180	1430620	Maybe this explains all the social justice apologetics for pedophilia that we're seeing
1430620	1431620	right now.
1431620	1435140	And of course, because of all of this, they definitely can't understand that when the
1435140	1439060	younger generation rebels against them, and decides to piss them off a little bit just
1439060	1443460	for the sake of pissing them off, that no, they're not actually being radicalized to
1443460	1448000	be Nazis or white supremacists or the alt-right or something ridiculous like that.
1448000	1449540	They're just being edgy.
1449540	1452020	They can't see that because they think they're still young.
1452020	1455620	They think, oh no, we're the ones being edgy by being far left.
1455620	1457260	People know things have changed.
1457260	1461540	Within the next 10 years, I expect a lot of the millennials to start going absolutely
1461540	1465540	apeshit as they realize that they're 45 with gray hair.
1465540	1469460	They're thinking of buying that sports car as their midlife crisis, that they are in
1469460	1471580	essence the dads that they hate.
1471580	1472580	And you know what?
1472580	1474820	So far, I've been mostly talking like this doesn't apply to me.
1474820	1475820	I don't think so.
1475820	1476820	It absolutely does apply to me.
1476820	1477820	I'm getting old too.
1477820	1482000	I am at least somewhat determined not to get old as I get older, meaning that I'm still
1482000	1484480	going to at least be open to new ideas.
1484480	1490520	But I do think that true maturity is balancing both the young and the old.
1490520	1494640	It's not simply believing blindly that you are a teenager when you're obviously not,
1494640	1499280	but it's also not giving up your passions like a lot of, you know, boomer style adults
1499280	1500280	do.
1500280	1503400	And ironically enough, I think that's actually the best way to avoid getting old.
1503400	1507720	You don't cling to this identity, this notion that you are the youth because that just leads
1507720	1511720	you to becoming insular, isolated, basically boomers.
1511720	1513680	Like all the examples we've talked about today.
1513680	1519480	But you do recognize that even as you age, you can still enjoy your life.
1519480	1524140	Understand who you are and where you are, both in place and in time.
1524140	1528280	But don't let that sour the things that you truly love.
1528280	1529960	I think that's how you stay young.
1529960	1531920	And that's something I'm going to try to do.
1531920	1534040	Anyway, sorry for the very long rant.
1534040	1536520	This is coming out on July 4th.
1536520	1540440	So if you pop over to my Twitch stream pretty much right now as the video goes up, I'm going
1540440	1544560	to be playing an appropriately themed America July 4th game.
1544560	1545780	So please check it out.
1545780	1548520	That's twitch.tv slash game boomers.
1548520	1550420	And hey, if you don't want to, that's fine, too.
1550420	1552440	I'll see you tomorrow for the weekly sip.
1552440	1553640	I love you guys.
1553640	1554840	And remember, stay young.
