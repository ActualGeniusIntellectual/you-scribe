00:00.000 --> 00:09.480
Yes, I must admit, I am a Linus Tech Tips cuck.

00:09.480 --> 00:13.880
The politics of his employees are insufferably progressive, while Linus himself doesn't

00:13.880 --> 00:16.920
seem to understand politics beyond surface level Good Things Good.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.840
But darn it, his videos are actually really fun.

00:18.840 --> 00:22.360
I'm a tinkerer and a tech head myself, so I'm pretty much the target audience for

00:22.360 --> 00:23.640
most of the stuff he puts out.

00:23.640 --> 00:27.140
However, I don't have the time to watch his podcast, The Wan Show, so I tend to only

00:27.140 --> 00:28.840
check out the clips that really interest me.

00:28.840 --> 00:32.760
And this one, Never Build a PC for Family, really interested me.

00:58.840 --> 01:02.360
Okay, so here's the situation.

01:02.360 --> 01:08.200
I built a PC for someone back inâ€¦ wait, this can't be right.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.200
I think I know who this is.

01:10.200 --> 01:14.240
Okay, well, whatever, it was a while ago, it was a couple months ago or something like

01:14.240 --> 01:15.240
that.

01:15.240 --> 01:19.600
In February, early February, I get a message, I'm just wondering how to get my monitor

01:19.600 --> 01:23.240
to 144 hertz, because apparently it's 60 right now.

01:23.240 --> 01:30.800
I kind of go, all right, it was definitely at 144 when I gave it to you, which is all

01:30.800 --> 01:32.440
I care about.

01:32.440 --> 01:40.640
This is one of those situations where the PC wasn't free, but it was very not retail,

01:40.640 --> 01:43.580
if you know what I mean.

01:43.580 --> 01:48.700
There was some wheeling and dealing that happened to make sure that this person who was a family

01:48.700 --> 01:54.580
friend definitely got something a lot better than they would have walked out of Best Buy

01:54.580 --> 01:55.580
with.

01:55.580 --> 01:56.580
Sure.

01:56.580 --> 02:00.300
So as far as I'm concerned, I have done my good deed already.

02:00.300 --> 02:01.780
Business over, yeah.

02:01.780 --> 02:05.680
Our transaction is now complete.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.380
So I kind of go, are you using HDMI or DisplayPort?

02:08.380 --> 02:10.900
HDMI may be stuck at a lower refresh rate.

02:10.900 --> 02:11.900
Basic troubleshooting.

02:11.900 --> 02:12.900
Yep.

02:12.900 --> 02:13.900
I don't know what that means.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.900
Sorry, how can I check?

02:15.900 --> 02:19.140
And I kind of go, you're going to have to look up how to check.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.140
Use Google.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.140
Okay.

02:21.140 --> 02:23.260
All right.

02:23.260 --> 02:28.160
Two weeks later, I've been having problems connecting my headset mic.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.660
When I checked, it's not registering.

02:29.660 --> 02:31.020
It doesn't say the model of headset.

02:31.020 --> 02:32.660
Here, I'll show it to you screenshot.

02:32.660 --> 02:34.340
I'm like, I don't know.

02:34.340 --> 02:37.420
If I was in front of it, I might be able to figure it out, but you might just have to

02:37.420 --> 02:39.100
find some troubleshooting guides.

02:39.100 --> 02:48.700
I get no fewer than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 messages over the next three

02:48.700 --> 02:51.500
days.

02:51.500 --> 02:59.420
That go as far as, okay, I really think this is urgent.

02:59.420 --> 03:00.420
Please reply to this quickly.

03:00.420 --> 03:03.780
I can't do anything on my PC.

03:03.780 --> 03:14.760
I'm sitting here going, what's my incentive to do a favor for anyone at that point?

03:14.760 --> 03:18.100
If you're anything like me, you've probably experienced this too, back when you lived

03:18.100 --> 03:19.100
at home.

03:19.100 --> 03:22.420
The minute you reveal that you know anything about technology, suddenly you're the one

03:22.420 --> 03:26.300
on the hook doing free work for every single person in your extended family.

03:26.300 --> 03:29.020
Oh yeah, my son's really good with computers.

03:29.020 --> 03:31.220
I see him playing video games all the time.

03:31.220 --> 03:34.740
Of course he'll come over and set up your laptop and your home network with your printer

03:34.740 --> 03:36.980
and your TV's new surround sound system.

03:36.980 --> 03:39.900
Second cousin we see like once a year, he'd be happy to do it.

03:39.900 --> 03:42.640
No payment required.

03:42.640 --> 03:46.760
And of course, if anything goes wrong, even 10 years later, it's your fault.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.760
You screwed it up.

03:47.760 --> 03:50.300
They're completely right to be angry at you because you were supposed to handle it.

03:50.300 --> 03:53.860
No, it couldn't be all the fucking viruses they installed on their machine, from going

03:53.860 --> 03:58.620
to porn sites or installing the new episode of the latest boomer TV show, .exe.

03:58.620 --> 03:59.620
It has to be you.

03:59.700 --> 04:01.780
Heaven forbid this happened to you when you were a kid.

04:01.780 --> 04:05.380
Boomers always believed that a family computer couldn't possibly be fucked up by all the

04:05.380 --> 04:08.200
weird toolbars and bonsai buddies they installed.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.260
It had to be the fact that you were playing video games on it.

04:10.260 --> 04:14.020
I even experienced the weirder, lesser known variant of this.

04:14.020 --> 04:17.660
The idea that playing console games on a TV would damage the TV.

04:17.660 --> 04:19.220
It's just a picture signal, dude.

04:19.220 --> 04:20.580
How the hell is it any different from cable?

04:20.580 --> 04:22.220
But these are all millennial stories.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.980
And we're old people now, apparently, complaining about how people even older than us used to

04:25.980 --> 04:28.700
treat us with regards to new technology back when we were kids.

04:28.780 --> 04:31.300
And there's sort of a through line here with technological advancement.

04:31.300 --> 04:34.740
Since I would guess the start of the industrial revolution, no we're not talking about Uncle

04:34.740 --> 04:38.820
Ted today, the rate of technological change has been significantly faster than before.

04:38.820 --> 04:42.540
In the before times, you might have had to get used to a new innovation like once a generation

04:42.540 --> 04:46.900
or something, when somebody invents a slightly better medieval weapon or a way to use a draft

04:46.900 --> 04:47.940
animal or some shit.

04:47.940 --> 04:52.500
But once we started using science to build machines to accomplish jobs for us, the paradigm

04:52.500 --> 04:55.580
of labor has completely changed every generation.

04:55.580 --> 04:59.620
This necessitated each person acquiring a completely new set of skills than even what

04:59.620 --> 05:03.620
their parents had learned, and each generation having a completely different sense of what

05:03.620 --> 05:05.780
should be considered common knowledge.

05:05.780 --> 05:06.900
Music is an obvious example.

05:06.900 --> 05:10.340
Back in the day, you had to have people who could actually play music right there if you

05:10.340 --> 05:11.340
wanted to hear it.

05:11.340 --> 05:14.300
In 1896, the pneumatic piano player was invented.

05:14.300 --> 05:17.180
You know what I mean, that piano with the cartridge in the front with a roll and a bunch

05:17.180 --> 05:19.900
of notches in it, where when you activated the machine, the roll would feed through the

05:19.900 --> 05:22.780
device and the notches would trigger mechanisms to play the piano on its own?

05:22.780 --> 05:25.600
With this invention, you didn't need somebody present to actually play the piano.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.700
You simply needed the roll with the song that you want.

05:27.700 --> 05:29.820
You install it in the piano and then let it play itself.

05:29.820 --> 05:34.220
The record player was invented earlier as the phonograph in 1877, but the quality of

05:34.220 --> 05:38.620
music it produced was far inferior initially, and the first records were made out of tinfoil,

05:38.620 --> 05:40.460
not wax, making them extremely fragile.

05:40.460 --> 05:44.500
It only really began to take off after the tech improved enough in the early 20th century.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.900
Now you don't need a whole-ass piano playing a giant reel, you need your turntable and

05:47.900 --> 05:48.900
a record.

05:48.900 --> 05:53.720
Story goes for the 8-track, the cassette, the CD, the MP3, and now streaming services.

05:53.720 --> 05:58.540
Each one is a new way of saving a prior musical recording for future consumption, divided

05:58.540 --> 06:03.220
by generation, and the knowledge required to use, appreciate, and create each medium

06:03.220 --> 06:06.260
is, for the most part, specialized to that generation.

06:06.260 --> 06:10.180
This same divide exists with pretty much all entertainment media, movies, shows, games,

06:10.180 --> 06:11.180
books.

06:11.180 --> 06:14.300
It exists with vehicles, it exists with fashion sense and food taste and employment.

06:14.300 --> 06:18.220
Hell, my parents still struggle with their own smart TV, and I'm regularly employed

06:18.220 --> 06:21.540
to set up whatever movie we're watching whenever I visit, even though I rarely go

06:21.540 --> 06:24.620
back to my hometown and they know they're set up way better than I do.

06:24.620 --> 06:29.100
A core component of modernity is the rate of technological advancement is so fast that

06:29.100 --> 06:33.500
the previous generation's knowledge and rules about how the world is becomes obsolete

06:33.500 --> 06:38.040
much faster than before, hence the phenomenon of my generation running rings around our

06:38.040 --> 06:39.840
parents with computers and the internet.

06:39.840 --> 06:44.260
The millennial experience is one of actually getting away with shit online when we were

06:44.260 --> 06:47.860
kids, from pirating TV shows or games on the family computer, to downloading porn on a

06:47.860 --> 06:51.020
file-sharing program when you're really too young to be watching porn.

06:51.020 --> 06:54.500
Parents always have their values and their rules, and kids always chafe against those

06:54.500 --> 06:56.140
values and rules as they get older.

06:56.140 --> 06:57.140
That's pretty normal.

06:57.140 --> 07:00.320
But technology gave kids the decisive victory in that fight.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.660
What hope do parents have about smarting their kids on the internet when they can barely

07:03.660 --> 07:06.540
set up the speed dial on their first non-rotary phone?

07:06.540 --> 07:10.540
However, what Linus is talking about here actually isn't about helping an older relative

07:10.540 --> 07:11.540
with new technology.

07:11.540 --> 07:13.340
It's about helping a younger one.

07:13.340 --> 07:14.340
Yeah, seriously.

07:14.340 --> 07:15.340
Listen to this.

07:15.340 --> 07:19.980
I feel like this is one of those, am I the a**hole things, right?

07:19.980 --> 07:25.260
For basically just saying, so my response to this wall of text is, sorry, I really can't

07:25.260 --> 07:26.380
dig into issues like this.

07:26.380 --> 07:29.100
If there's a problem, you'll have to shut it down for now and take it to a computer

07:29.100 --> 07:30.100
shop.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.880
Or you can try and fix it yourself.

07:31.880 --> 07:35.980
I didn't have anyone to help me troubleshoot and things usually worked out okay.

07:35.980 --> 07:38.760
Tongue, smiley face.

07:38.760 --> 07:43.680
A little bit of sass on the end, a little bit of unnecessary sass on the end.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.360
Here's the thing.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.360
I mean, okay.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.000
Have you, have you read these articles?

07:48.000 --> 07:52.900
And I've heard anecdotally from some, a couple of people I've talked to this about recently,

07:52.900 --> 07:57.000
one who's a teacher and one who worked in an office.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.820
And I've read articles about this too, that apparently the younger generation in spite

08:00.820 --> 08:06.880
of growing up with computers is entering the workplace with fewer functional computing

08:06.880 --> 08:07.880
skills.

08:07.880 --> 08:11.640
They grew up with less computer problems because things worked more often.

08:11.640 --> 08:14.180
So that's the thing, right?

08:14.180 --> 08:16.200
Is this just tough love?

08:16.200 --> 08:17.800
That's that's what I thought I was doing.

08:17.800 --> 08:20.840
Like, look, no, if you want to solve this, if you want to play video games, I didn't

08:20.840 --> 08:23.460
want to pry, but is this a younger person?

08:23.460 --> 08:24.460
This is a younger person.

08:24.460 --> 08:25.460
Yes.

08:25.460 --> 08:26.460
So I got that vibe.

08:26.460 --> 08:27.460
Yeah.

08:27.460 --> 08:31.560
And in that case, I mean, I, it seems more fair.

08:31.560 --> 08:32.560
I don't know.

08:32.560 --> 08:35.920
Cause I mean, realistically, what do young people even do?

08:35.920 --> 08:37.640
Honestly, you're done.

08:37.640 --> 08:41.400
You're done your obligations for the day by like three o'clock.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.400
Is that when school ends?

08:42.400 --> 08:43.400
I don't even remember.

08:43.400 --> 08:44.400
Yeah.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.400
So figure it out.

08:45.400 --> 08:50.440
Like, I, I, I'm not trying to be a jerk about it or anything, but that was how I learned.

08:50.440 --> 08:54.760
The only reason that I'm doing this today that I know any of this stuff is because I

08:54.760 --> 09:00.200
was highly motivated to fix my computer because I wanted to play video games.

09:00.200 --> 09:04.320
This is something that I think I've intuitively known for a while, but it's weird to finally

09:04.320 --> 09:05.640
hear somebody else say it.

09:05.640 --> 09:10.280
The trend of younger generations being acclimated to newer technology and running circles around

09:10.280 --> 09:13.160
older generations with it has seemingly been broken.

09:13.160 --> 09:15.920
Zoomers actually do have less tech skill than millennials.

09:15.920 --> 09:18.080
I think Luke's explanation is partially true.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.020
That because things break down less nowadays, there's less incentive to become a tinkerer.

09:22.020 --> 09:26.440
This kind of gives the back in my day boomer complaints a bit more credence that having

09:26.440 --> 09:30.960
to deal with the hardships of older non-functioning technology gave you a deeper understanding

09:30.960 --> 09:33.520
of how it worked to stay on the computer topic.

09:33.520 --> 09:36.560
Overclocking back in the day meant fiddling with jumpers on the motherboard, including

09:36.560 --> 09:39.840
together water cooling components out of aquarium parts.

09:39.880 --> 09:43.600
Clocking nowadays means going into the BIOS, changing a few settings, and making sure your

09:43.600 --> 09:45.000
AIO can handle the load.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.400
It's just easier, and that's great for people who are sick of doing it the old way, but

09:48.400 --> 09:52.800
it also doesn't lend itself to new people coming into the space and truly understanding

09:52.800 --> 09:55.320
what they're doing whenever they change that setting in a menu.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.320
It's not just that, though.

09:56.320 --> 10:00.320
It's also because devices are way more black box than they used to be.

10:00.320 --> 10:01.520
Black box is a computer term.

10:01.520 --> 10:05.480
It means a system which can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs, without any knowledge

10:05.480 --> 10:06.600
of its internal workings.

10:06.600 --> 10:10.840
To somebody who is not knowledgeable about computers, data goes in, data appears on the

10:10.840 --> 10:11.840
screen.

10:11.840 --> 10:12.840
How does it work?

10:12.840 --> 10:13.840
Who knows?

10:13.840 --> 10:14.840
It's a black box.

10:14.840 --> 10:19.080
Manufacturers of modern technology are incentivized to create black box devices.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.680
This is done through two strategies.

10:20.680 --> 10:24.720
One, you make the innards of the device as hard as possible to actually access by the

10:24.720 --> 10:25.720
average person.

10:25.720 --> 10:30.280
Two, you incentivize people thinking in black box terms, like their phone is just a magic

10:30.280 --> 10:34.240
brick that does stuff, and its mechanisms are truly unknowable by the human mind.

10:34.240 --> 10:38.000
They do this because it allows them to upcharge for the device by pretending it's more complicated

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
than it actually is.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.280
It allows them to upcharge for repairs of the device because you don't even know how

10:42.280 --> 10:43.280
to fix it.

10:43.280 --> 10:45.480
So how do you know what parts or labor even costs?

10:45.480 --> 10:48.040
And it allows them to control what you do with the device.

10:48.040 --> 10:51.020
This is what is meant by the Apple ecosystem, for example.

10:51.020 --> 10:54.760
Why you need to use specific approved apps on Apple devices.

10:54.760 --> 10:57.920
Because unlike with a PC that you've built yourself, you're locked out of the backend,

10:57.920 --> 10:59.440
the foundational level of the hardware.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.960
You have to play within the confines of Apple software.

11:01.960 --> 11:05.200
And anything they don't give you access to might as well not even exist.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.920
Unless of course, you backdoor it.

11:06.920 --> 11:11.240
This is why various conversations like the right to repair your own device, or the legality

11:11.240 --> 11:15.520
of rooting your phone and installing your own base software on it, are hot button topics

11:15.520 --> 11:16.840
in tech circles right now.

11:16.840 --> 11:21.080
There's power in controlling how the user uses your device after you've sold it to them.

11:21.080 --> 11:24.800
And people who tinker, whether that's installing Homebrew on a console, or running a new OS

11:24.800 --> 11:28.640
on a phone, have routinely been caught in the crosshairs of big corpos.

11:28.640 --> 11:33.080
All of this is to say that the technology zoomers have grown up with is extremely reliable

11:33.080 --> 11:34.160
and convenient.

11:34.160 --> 11:38.760
And with those benefits has also come both increasing corporate control and the gradual

11:38.760 --> 11:41.480
shift away from learning how your stuff actually works.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.080
Because most of the time you just don't need to know.

11:43.080 --> 11:46.720
Your average zoomer might be able to pull out his phone and play a game, or access the

11:46.720 --> 11:47.720
internet, or record a video.

11:47.720 --> 11:51.780
But if you ask them to install an app that Apple or Google didn't want them to install

11:51.780 --> 11:55.680
by jailbreaking the device and running a sideloader or something, they'd look at you like your

11:55.680 --> 11:56.680
head was on funny.

11:56.680 --> 11:57.680
Why would you ever do that?

11:57.720 --> 12:00.960
In fact, this whole thing reminds me of a viral tweet my friend Tina put out a little

12:00.960 --> 12:01.960
bit ago.

12:01.960 --> 12:05.180
An article on Variety.com claims that the Netflix password crackdown has driven the

12:05.180 --> 12:07.580
highest rate of Netflix signups in years.

12:07.580 --> 12:12.120
The common knowledge of my generation said that, due to increasing tech savviness, people

12:12.120 --> 12:15.760
would largely return to piracy in the face of Netflix's crackdown.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.920
Joke's on you fucks, I never left.

12:17.920 --> 12:21.760
But the reason that Netflix went out initially was because its extreme convenience won out

12:21.760 --> 12:25.320
over the relatively complicated piracy methods of 10-15 years ago.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.160
Go watch my video on Netflix for more info on that.

12:27.160 --> 12:32.320
Our lord and savior Gaben, the owner of Steam, rightfully said that piracy is a service problem,

12:32.320 --> 12:33.320
not a pricing problem.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.520
In other words, people pirate your game not because it's too expensive, but because

12:36.520 --> 12:38.840
it was too inconvenient to get legally.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.280
And he's largely correct.

12:40.280 --> 12:41.700
Netflix was convenient.

12:41.700 --> 12:45.080
Every show available for streaming legally on one platform, one fee, watch anywhere?

12:45.080 --> 12:46.080
Sounds great.

12:46.080 --> 12:49.540
But as streaming became less and less convenient, conventional knowledge predicted that piracy

12:49.540 --> 12:51.760
would return, and that didn't actually happen.

12:51.760 --> 12:55.320
Tina replied to this article with a quip, the children lack the knowledge to torrent,

12:55.320 --> 12:56.320
we have failed.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.160
It's a joke, but it's also true.

12:58.160 --> 13:02.360
Torrenting's even easier now than it was before, with one-click magnet links.

13:02.360 --> 13:06.560
And yet simply signing up, signing in, and flopping on the couch makes Netflix the most

13:06.560 --> 13:11.340
convenient choice, especially among a generation with less technical prowess like the zoomers.

13:11.340 --> 13:15.280
Some zoomers, in fact, took being called out for their lack of skill very poorly.

13:15.280 --> 13:18.000
30-year-olds on Twitter are so annoying about torrenting.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.920
I don't know, Amanda, is that like the new Karen or something?

13:20.920 --> 13:24.180
Maybe a lot of people just figure it's worth spending a little money to not have the hassle

13:24.180 --> 13:28.180
of torrenting something or to watch it on the big TV through the PlayStation or whatever.

13:28.180 --> 13:31.420
You can still watch a torrented file on the big TV through a variety of different methods

13:31.420 --> 13:33.760
like listen to this bitch, she sounds like a fucking grandma.

13:33.760 --> 13:34.760
What happened?

13:34.760 --> 13:37.180
You're supposed to make me look like a tech boomer, way more than I already do with my

13:37.180 --> 13:38.180
own fumblings.

13:38.180 --> 13:41.100
You should be schooling me on this, why are you so fucking weak?

13:41.100 --> 13:44.660
When you look at all the technological marvels around you, is there not even a single bit

13:44.660 --> 13:45.660
of curiosity?

13:45.660 --> 13:48.920
Like, oh, I wonder how that gadget works, maybe I should tinker with it and learn a

13:48.920 --> 13:49.920
little bit.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.560
Do you even have a spark of consciousness?

13:51.560 --> 13:54.660
This is about people who whine about company policies but still pay for its products as

13:54.660 --> 13:55.840
if they can't live without them.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.920
It's completely understandable with basic modern necessities, but you can survive the

13:58.920 --> 14:01.480
inconvenience of pirating or just not watching or playing something.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.480
No, it's not.

14:02.480 --> 14:06.440
It's about grouchy people approaching middle age complaining about the kids these days.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.560
You see, it is actually a generational thing.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.980
They think that millennials are out of touch, but not because we've fallen out of touch

14:11.980 --> 14:15.600
like previous generations have with new technology, but because they've remained ignorant.

14:15.600 --> 14:20.400
They don't even have a new canon of knowledge that corresponds with their new technology

14:20.400 --> 14:25.100
to replace my old out-of-touch canon like previous generations did, unless the ever-expanding

14:25.100 --> 14:27.920
database of new genders and pronouns counts anyway.

14:27.920 --> 14:49.880
Like, listen to some of these fucking people.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.840
Bitch how do you not know the stars on your own flag?

14:51.840 --> 14:53.800
I knew that shit when I was like 8 years old.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.120
I'm a fucking Canadian.

14:55.120 --> 15:02.240
What ocean is on the east side of the United States?

15:02.240 --> 15:07.680
You guys know this.

15:07.680 --> 15:12.080
What ocean is on the east side of the United States?

15:12.080 --> 15:18.840
You don't know the oceans?

15:18.840 --> 15:21.560
You never had that world geo class with the little worksheet?

15:21.560 --> 15:23.800
What country is the queen of England from?

15:23.800 --> 15:26.680
I'm not a policy guy.

15:26.680 --> 15:27.680
I don't know.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.680
I don't know.

15:28.680 --> 15:29.680
I really don't know.

15:29.680 --> 15:30.680
Just take a guess.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.680
Like, what country is the queen of England from?

15:32.680 --> 15:33.680
Europe.

15:33.680 --> 15:34.680
I don't fucking know.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.560
It's in the fucking name, you doofus.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.280
What's the capital of the United States?

15:38.280 --> 15:42.360
Um, the, um, there's a capital?

15:42.360 --> 15:43.360
What?

15:43.360 --> 15:44.360
Lexi.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.360
Take a guess.

15:45.360 --> 15:50.960
Um, um, I don't know, probably California.

15:50.960 --> 15:51.960
That's right.

15:51.960 --> 15:52.960
It is?

15:52.960 --> 15:53.960
No.

15:53.960 --> 15:54.960
The United States.

15:54.960 --> 15:55.960
Do we know?

15:55.960 --> 15:56.960
Stop!

15:56.960 --> 15:57.960
I knew he was going to embarrass us.

15:57.960 --> 15:58.960
I know.

15:58.960 --> 15:59.960
Wait.

15:59.960 --> 16:00.960
I didn't want to think because I don't want to say I'm dead.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.080
Just give it some thought.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.080
Deep breath.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.080
Capital of the United States.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.080
Exhale.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.080
There's no capital of the United States.

16:07.080 --> 16:08.080
Yeah, literally.

16:08.080 --> 16:09.080
Is there no capital?

16:09.080 --> 16:10.080
Correct.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.080
Was that right?

16:11.080 --> 16:12.080
No.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.080
Oh, fuck.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.080
You guys are UCLA students?

16:14.080 --> 16:15.080
We literally go to UCLA.

16:15.800 --> 16:16.800
Yeah.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.320
Where do you think the capital riots you've been shitting yourself for the past few years

16:19.320 --> 16:20.320
have even happened?

16:20.320 --> 16:21.320
Dude, come on!

16:21.320 --> 16:23.560
What group of people did the Nazis target?

16:23.560 --> 16:26.320
Oh, why is it bad Nazis?

16:26.320 --> 16:27.600
Um, kids.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.320
Oh my fucking god.

16:29.320 --> 16:33.400
This is when you're so retarded that the idea of the Nazis bothers you, but you don't even

16:33.400 --> 16:35.160
know why they're bad.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.280
Can you name the three Kardashian sisters?

16:38.280 --> 16:40.960
Kim, Kourtney, and Khloe.

16:40.960 --> 16:43.880
What are the three Kardashian sisters' names?

16:43.880 --> 16:46.480
Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.000
Bonus points for the brother?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.240
Um, Robert.

16:49.240 --> 16:51.000
The Kardashians' brother's name.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
What?

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Rob.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Fuck me, dude.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
We're doomed.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Yeah, I know.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Every generation says this about the kids coming up, but I was never this stupid.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.520
I could answer all these questions before I was in high school.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.520
No problem.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.520
No sweat.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.600
So, um, y'all sure you don't want to make college more accessible?

17:05.600 --> 17:06.600
Just checking.

17:06.600 --> 17:07.600
No, Shaniqua.

17:07.600 --> 17:08.600
I don't want to make college more accessible.

17:08.600 --> 17:10.680
These people didn't get any benefit from fucking high school.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.160
What benefit are they going to get from college?

17:12.160 --> 17:13.560
Some people just don't make it, man.

17:14.240 --> 17:16.440
I remember being a kid, I remember there was this one kid who was, like, eating glue.

17:16.440 --> 17:19.880
I was in kindergarten, even then, I went to him and I was like, dude, why are you eating

17:19.880 --> 17:20.880
the glue?

17:20.880 --> 17:21.880
Don't you know that's awful for you?

17:21.880 --> 17:26.160
And he looked up in this snot-covered haze and he was like, mmm, tastes good.

17:26.160 --> 17:30.400
That's your average fucking person, dude, led around by their immediate base impulses

17:30.400 --> 17:32.140
with no conception of the future.

17:32.140 --> 17:35.160
Even if we sent these failures off to college, what do you think they'd learn there?

17:35.160 --> 17:38.120
Maybe they'd get themselves a gender studies degree, go eat the Play-Doh in the campus

17:38.120 --> 17:39.400
pride safe space?

17:39.400 --> 17:42.800
This is why we've got people clamoring for historical novels and old movies and shit

17:42.840 --> 17:45.120
to be censored for a modern fucking audience.

17:45.120 --> 17:49.120
Because the people that make up a modern fucking audience can't stand being even slightly

17:49.120 --> 17:50.120
uncomfortable.

17:50.120 --> 17:51.540
I can't show you this video because she's deleted it.

17:51.540 --> 17:53.720
As far as I can find, there's only screencaps of what happened.

17:53.720 --> 17:57.120
But this Zoomer did the whole thing where you dance over some unrelated music with a

17:57.120 --> 17:58.120
caption.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.740
This one's saying, our generation isn't soft.

17:59.740 --> 18:00.740
You're just racist and homophobic.

18:00.740 --> 18:03.000
Yeah, bitch, then why don't you turn off the comments if you're not soft?

18:03.000 --> 18:06.500
I've said this many times about many different people, many different types of people.

18:06.500 --> 18:10.960
My stalwart consistency on this topic has gotten me in trouble with my own fans, in

18:10.960 --> 18:11.960
fact.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.120
I am correct here.

18:13.120 --> 18:17.560
If internet pushback makes you block people or disable comments or cry and run away and

18:17.560 --> 18:19.160
log off, you're soft.

18:19.160 --> 18:20.220
That's just how it is.

18:20.220 --> 18:23.640
Because the real world is a whole lot harsher than mean words on a screen.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.600
The Zoomers will never have their communist revolution no matter how much they cry about

18:26.600 --> 18:30.480
it because they have to go to therapy to learn how to order a pizza over the fucking phone.

18:30.480 --> 18:32.940
And getting called the wrong pronoun gives them a panic attack.

18:32.940 --> 18:34.400
There's no way they're overthrowing a state.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.680
I know, I know, I'm on yet another old man dev rant.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.640
I guess that's just my lot in life now.

18:39.640 --> 18:44.000
But again, at least with previous generational shifts, there was a reason for that superior

18:44.000 --> 18:45.400
attitude of young people.

18:45.400 --> 18:46.400
They were more capable.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.280
They knew how to use that new technology.

18:48.280 --> 18:49.880
They were the future of progress.

18:49.880 --> 18:50.900
That's not the Zoomers.

18:50.900 --> 18:52.760
Their skills have actually regressed.

18:52.760 --> 18:55.340
Your average millennial can change out the RAM in a PC.

18:55.340 --> 18:57.640
Your average boomer can change out the spark plug in a car.

18:57.640 --> 19:00.600
Do you think your average Zoomer can do either of those things?

19:00.600 --> 19:02.280
Zoomers are the ultimate paradox.

19:02.280 --> 19:06.080
They're tethered to modern technology, and that technology is actually destroying them.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.480
Sargon did an excellent video about that over at the Lotus Eaters.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.680
But unlike with previous generations, they aren't even getting the other side of that

19:11.680 --> 19:12.680
Faustian bargain.

19:12.680 --> 19:16.060
They're not even acquiring the benefit of superior knowledge and skill that comes with

19:16.060 --> 19:17.060
new technology.

19:17.060 --> 19:18.600
Instead, they're getting dumber.

19:18.600 --> 19:21.460
Because rather than learning about how the technology that dominates their lives actually

19:21.460 --> 19:25.440
functions so that they can one day become its masters, they're simply submitting to

19:25.440 --> 19:30.040
it because it's more convenient to be a coomer and a consumer than it is to understand and

19:30.040 --> 19:30.360
create.
