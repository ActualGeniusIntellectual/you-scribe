1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
Yes, I must admit, I am a Linus Tech Tips cuck.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,880
The politics of his employees are insufferably progressive, while Linus himself doesn't

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,920
seem to understand politics beyond surface level Good Things Good.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,840
But darn it, his videos are actually really fun.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,360
I'm a tinkerer and a tech head myself, so I'm pretty much the target audience for

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,640
most of the stuff he puts out.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,140
However, I don't have the time to watch his podcast, The Wan Show, so I tend to only

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,840
check out the clips that really interest me.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,760
And this one, Never Build a PC for Family, really interested me.

10
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,360
Okay, so here's the situation.

11
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:08,200
I built a PC for someone back inâ€¦ wait, this can't be right.

12
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
I think I know who this is.

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,240
Okay, well, whatever, it was a while ago, it was a couple months ago or something like

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,240
that.

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,600
In February, early February, I get a message, I'm just wondering how to get my monitor

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,240
to 144 hertz, because apparently it's 60 right now.

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:30,800
I kind of go, all right, it was definitely at 144 when I gave it to you, which is all

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,440
I care about.

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:40,640
This is one of those situations where the PC wasn't free, but it was very not retail,

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,580
if you know what I mean.

21
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:48,700
There was some wheeling and dealing that happened to make sure that this person who was a family

22
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,580
friend definitely got something a lot better than they would have walked out of Best Buy

23
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,580
with.

24
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,580
Sure.

25
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,300
So as far as I'm concerned, I have done my good deed already.

26
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,780
Business over, yeah.

27
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,680
Our transaction is now complete.

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,380
So I kind of go, are you using HDMI or DisplayPort?

29
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,900
HDMI may be stuck at a lower refresh rate.

30
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,900
Basic troubleshooting.

31
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,900
Yep.

32
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,900
I don't know what that means.

33
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,900
Sorry, how can I check?

34
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,140
And I kind of go, you're going to have to look up how to check.

35
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,140
Use Google.

36
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,140
Okay.

37
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,260
All right.

38
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,160
Two weeks later, I've been having problems connecting my headset mic.

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,660
When I checked, it's not registering.

40
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,020
It doesn't say the model of headset.

41
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,660
Here, I'll show it to you screenshot.

42
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,340
I'm like, I don't know.

43
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,420
If I was in front of it, I might be able to figure it out, but you might just have to

44
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,100
find some troubleshooting guides.

45
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:48,700
I get no fewer than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 messages over the next three

46
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,500
days.

47
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:59,420
That go as far as, okay, I really think this is urgent.

48
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,420
Please reply to this quickly.

49
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,780
I can't do anything on my PC.

50
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:14,760
I'm sitting here going, what's my incentive to do a favor for anyone at that point?

51
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,100
If you're anything like me, you've probably experienced this too, back when you lived

52
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,100
at home.

53
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,420
The minute you reveal that you know anything about technology, suddenly you're the one

54
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,300
on the hook doing free work for every single person in your extended family.

55
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,020
Oh yeah, my son's really good with computers.

56
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,220
I see him playing video games all the time.

57
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,740
Of course he'll come over and set up your laptop and your home network with your printer

58
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,980
and your TV's new surround sound system.

59
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,900
Second cousin we see like once a year, he'd be happy to do it.

60
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,640
No payment required.

61
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,760
And of course, if anything goes wrong, even 10 years later, it's your fault.

62
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
You screwed it up.

63
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,300
They're completely right to be angry at you because you were supposed to handle it.

64
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,860
No, it couldn't be all the fucking viruses they installed on their machine, from going

65
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,620
to porn sites or installing the new episode of the latest boomer TV show, .exe.

66
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,620
It has to be you.

67
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,780
Heaven forbid this happened to you when you were a kid.

68
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,380
Boomers always believed that a family computer couldn't possibly be fucked up by all the

69
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,200
weird toolbars and bonsai buddies they installed.

70
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,260
It had to be the fact that you were playing video games on it.

71
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,020
I even experienced the weirder, lesser known variant of this.

72
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,660
The idea that playing console games on a TV would damage the TV.

73
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,220
It's just a picture signal, dude.

74
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,580
How the hell is it any different from cable?

75
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,220
But these are all millennial stories.

76
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,980
And we're old people now, apparently, complaining about how people even older than us used to

77
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,700
treat us with regards to new technology back when we were kids.

78
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,300
And there's sort of a through line here with technological advancement.

79
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,740
Since I would guess the start of the industrial revolution, no we're not talking about Uncle

80
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,820
Ted today, the rate of technological change has been significantly faster than before.

81
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,540
In the before times, you might have had to get used to a new innovation like once a generation

82
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,900
or something, when somebody invents a slightly better medieval weapon or a way to use a draft

83
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,940
animal or some shit.

84
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,500
But once we started using science to build machines to accomplish jobs for us, the paradigm

85
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,580
of labor has completely changed every generation.

86
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,620
This necessitated each person acquiring a completely new set of skills than even what

87
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,620
their parents had learned, and each generation having a completely different sense of what

88
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,780
should be considered common knowledge.

89
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,900
Music is an obvious example.

90
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,340
Back in the day, you had to have people who could actually play music right there if you

91
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,340
wanted to hear it.

92
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,300
In 1896, the pneumatic piano player was invented.

93
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,180
You know what I mean, that piano with the cartridge in the front with a roll and a bunch

94
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,900
of notches in it, where when you activated the machine, the roll would feed through the

95
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,780
device and the notches would trigger mechanisms to play the piano on its own?

96
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,600
With this invention, you didn't need somebody present to actually play the piano.

97
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,700
You simply needed the roll with the song that you want.

98
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,820
You install it in the piano and then let it play itself.

99
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,220
The record player was invented earlier as the phonograph in 1877, but the quality of

100
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,620
music it produced was far inferior initially, and the first records were made out of tinfoil,

101
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,460
not wax, making them extremely fragile.

102
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,500
It only really began to take off after the tech improved enough in the early 20th century.

103
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,900
Now you don't need a whole-ass piano playing a giant reel, you need your turntable and

104
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,900
a record.

105
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,720
Story goes for the 8-track, the cassette, the CD, the MP3, and now streaming services.

106
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,540
Each one is a new way of saving a prior musical recording for future consumption, divided

107
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,220
by generation, and the knowledge required to use, appreciate, and create each medium

108
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,260
is, for the most part, specialized to that generation.

109
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,180
This same divide exists with pretty much all entertainment media, movies, shows, games,

110
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,180
books.

111
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,300
It exists with vehicles, it exists with fashion sense and food taste and employment.

112
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,220
Hell, my parents still struggle with their own smart TV, and I'm regularly employed

113
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,540
to set up whatever movie we're watching whenever I visit, even though I rarely go

114
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,620
back to my hometown and they know they're set up way better than I do.

115
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:29,100
A core component of modernity is the rate of technological advancement is so fast that

116
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,500
the previous generation's knowledge and rules about how the world is becomes obsolete

117
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,040
much faster than before, hence the phenomenon of my generation running rings around our

118
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,840
parents with computers and the internet.

119
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,260
The millennial experience is one of actually getting away with shit online when we were

120
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,860
kids, from pirating TV shows or games on the family computer, to downloading porn on a

121
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,020
file-sharing program when you're really too young to be watching porn.

122
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,500
Parents always have their values and their rules, and kids always chafe against those

123
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,140
values and rules as they get older.

124
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,140
That's pretty normal.

125
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,320
But technology gave kids the decisive victory in that fight.

126
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,660
What hope do parents have about smarting their kids on the internet when they can barely

127
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,540
set up the speed dial on their first non-rotary phone?

128
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,540
However, what Linus is talking about here actually isn't about helping an older relative

129
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,540
with new technology.

130
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,340
It's about helping a younger one.

131
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,340
Yeah, seriously.

132
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,340
Listen to this.

133
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,980
I feel like this is one of those, am I the a**hole things, right?

134
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:25,260
For basically just saying, so my response to this wall of text is, sorry, I really can't

135
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,380
dig into issues like this.

136
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,100
If there's a problem, you'll have to shut it down for now and take it to a computer

137
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,100
shop.

138
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,880
Or you can try and fix it yourself.

139
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,980
I didn't have anyone to help me troubleshoot and things usually worked out okay.

140
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,760
Tongue, smiley face.

141
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,680
A little bit of sass on the end, a little bit of unnecessary sass on the end.

142
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
Here's the thing.

143
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
I mean, okay.

144
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,000
Have you, have you read these articles?

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,900
And I've heard anecdotally from some, a couple of people I've talked to this about recently,

146
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,000
one who's a teacher and one who worked in an office.

147
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,820
And I've read articles about this too, that apparently the younger generation in spite

148
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:06,880
of growing up with computers is entering the workplace with fewer functional computing

149
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
skills.

150
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,640
They grew up with less computer problems because things worked more often.

151
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,180
So that's the thing, right?

152
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,200
Is this just tough love?

153
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,800
That's that's what I thought I was doing.

154
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,840
Like, look, no, if you want to solve this, if you want to play video games, I didn't

155
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,460
want to pry, but is this a younger person?

156
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,460
This is a younger person.

157
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,460
Yes.

158
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,460
So I got that vibe.

159
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,460
Yeah.

160
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,560
And in that case, I mean, I, it seems more fair.

161
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
I don't know.

162
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,920
Cause I mean, realistically, what do young people even do?

163
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,640
Honestly, you're done.

164
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,400
You're done your obligations for the day by like three o'clock.

165
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Is that when school ends?

166
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
I don't even remember.

167
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Yeah.

168
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
So figure it out.

169
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,440
Like, I, I, I'm not trying to be a jerk about it or anything, but that was how I learned.

170
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,760
The only reason that I'm doing this today that I know any of this stuff is because I

171
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,200
was highly motivated to fix my computer because I wanted to play video games.

172
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,320
This is something that I think I've intuitively known for a while, but it's weird to finally

173
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,640
hear somebody else say it.

174
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,280
The trend of younger generations being acclimated to newer technology and running circles around

175
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,160
older generations with it has seemingly been broken.

176
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,920
Zoomers actually do have less tech skill than millennials.

177
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,080
I think Luke's explanation is partially true.

178
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,020
That because things break down less nowadays, there's less incentive to become a tinkerer.

179
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,440
This kind of gives the back in my day boomer complaints a bit more credence that having

180
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,960
to deal with the hardships of older non-functioning technology gave you a deeper understanding

181
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,520
of how it worked to stay on the computer topic.

182
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,560
Overclocking back in the day meant fiddling with jumpers on the motherboard, including

183
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,840
together water cooling components out of aquarium parts.

184
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,600
Clocking nowadays means going into the BIOS, changing a few settings, and making sure your

185
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,000
AIO can handle the load.

186
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,400
It's just easier, and that's great for people who are sick of doing it the old way, but

187
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,800
it also doesn't lend itself to new people coming into the space and truly understanding

188
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,320
what they're doing whenever they change that setting in a menu.

189
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
It's not just that, though.

190
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,320
It's also because devices are way more black box than they used to be.

191
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,520
Black box is a computer term.

192
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,480
It means a system which can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs, without any knowledge

193
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,600
of its internal workings.

194
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,840
To somebody who is not knowledgeable about computers, data goes in, data appears on the

195
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
screen.

196
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
How does it work?

197
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Who knows?

198
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
It's a black box.

199
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,080
Manufacturers of modern technology are incentivized to create black box devices.

200
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,680
This is done through two strategies.

201
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,720
One, you make the innards of the device as hard as possible to actually access by the

202
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
average person.

203
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,280
Two, you incentivize people thinking in black box terms, like their phone is just a magic

204
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,240
brick that does stuff, and its mechanisms are truly unknowable by the human mind.

205
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,000
They do this because it allows them to upcharge for the device by pretending it's more complicated

206
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
than it actually is.

207
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,280
It allows them to upcharge for repairs of the device because you don't even know how

208
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
to fix it.

209
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,480
So how do you know what parts or labor even costs?

210
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,040
And it allows them to control what you do with the device.

211
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,020
This is what is meant by the Apple ecosystem, for example.

212
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,760
Why you need to use specific approved apps on Apple devices.

213
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,920
Because unlike with a PC that you've built yourself, you're locked out of the backend,

214
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,440
the foundational level of the hardware.

215
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,960
You have to play within the confines of Apple software.

216
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,200
And anything they don't give you access to might as well not even exist.

217
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,920
Unless of course, you backdoor it.

218
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,240
This is why various conversations like the right to repair your own device, or the legality

219
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,520
of rooting your phone and installing your own base software on it, are hot button topics

220
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,840
in tech circles right now.

221
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,080
There's power in controlling how the user uses your device after you've sold it to them.

222
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,800
And people who tinker, whether that's installing Homebrew on a console, or running a new OS

223
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,640
on a phone, have routinely been caught in the crosshairs of big corpos.

224
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,080
All of this is to say that the technology zoomers have grown up with is extremely reliable

225
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,160
and convenient.

226
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,760
And with those benefits has also come both increasing corporate control and the gradual

227
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,480
shift away from learning how your stuff actually works.

228
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,080
Because most of the time you just don't need to know.

229
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,720
Your average zoomer might be able to pull out his phone and play a game, or access the

230
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
internet, or record a video.

231
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,780
But if you ask them to install an app that Apple or Google didn't want them to install

232
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,680
by jailbreaking the device and running a sideloader or something, they'd look at you like your

233
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,680
head was on funny.

234
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,680
Why would you ever do that?

235
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,960
In fact, this whole thing reminds me of a viral tweet my friend Tina put out a little

236
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
bit ago.

237
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,180
An article on Variety.com claims that the Netflix password crackdown has driven the

238
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,580
highest rate of Netflix signups in years.

239
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,120
The common knowledge of my generation said that, due to increasing tech savviness, people

240
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,760
would largely return to piracy in the face of Netflix's crackdown.

241
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,920
Joke's on you fucks, I never left.

242
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,760
But the reason that Netflix went out initially was because its extreme convenience won out

243
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,320
over the relatively complicated piracy methods of 10-15 years ago.

244
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,160
Go watch my video on Netflix for more info on that.

245
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,320
Our lord and savior Gaben, the owner of Steam, rightfully said that piracy is a service problem,

246
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
not a pricing problem.

247
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,520
In other words, people pirate your game not because it's too expensive, but because

248
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,840
it was too inconvenient to get legally.

249
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,280
And he's largely correct.

250
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,700
Netflix was convenient.

251
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,080
Every show available for streaming legally on one platform, one fee, watch anywhere?

252
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Sounds great.

253
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,540
But as streaming became less and less convenient, conventional knowledge predicted that piracy

254
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,760
would return, and that didn't actually happen.

255
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,320
Tina replied to this article with a quip, the children lack the knowledge to torrent,

256
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
we have failed.

257
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,160
It's a joke, but it's also true.

258
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,360
Torrenting's even easier now than it was before, with one-click magnet links.

259
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,560
And yet simply signing up, signing in, and flopping on the couch makes Netflix the most

260
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,340
convenient choice, especially among a generation with less technical prowess like the zoomers.

261
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,280
Some zoomers, in fact, took being called out for their lack of skill very poorly.

262
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,000
30-year-olds on Twitter are so annoying about torrenting.

263
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,920
I don't know, Amanda, is that like the new Karen or something?

264
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,180
Maybe a lot of people just figure it's worth spending a little money to not have the hassle

265
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,180
of torrenting something or to watch it on the big TV through the PlayStation or whatever.

266
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,420
You can still watch a torrented file on the big TV through a variety of different methods

267
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,760
like listen to this bitch, she sounds like a fucking grandma.

268
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
What happened?

269
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,180
You're supposed to make me look like a tech boomer, way more than I already do with my

270
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,180
own fumblings.

271
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,100
You should be schooling me on this, why are you so fucking weak?

272
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,660
When you look at all the technological marvels around you, is there not even a single bit

273
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,660
of curiosity?

274
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,920
Like, oh, I wonder how that gadget works, maybe I should tinker with it and learn a

275
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,920
little bit.

276
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,560
Do you even have a spark of consciousness?

277
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,660
This is about people who whine about company policies but still pay for its products as

278
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,840
if they can't live without them.

279
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,920
It's completely understandable with basic modern necessities, but you can survive the

280
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,480
inconvenience of pirating or just not watching or playing something.

281
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
No, it's not.

282
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,440
It's about grouchy people approaching middle age complaining about the kids these days.

283
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,560
You see, it is actually a generational thing.

284
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,980
They think that millennials are out of touch, but not because we've fallen out of touch

285
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,600
like previous generations have with new technology, but because they've remained ignorant.

286
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,400
They don't even have a new canon of knowledge that corresponds with their new technology

287
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,100
to replace my old out-of-touch canon like previous generations did, unless the ever-expanding

288
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,920
database of new genders and pronouns counts anyway.

289
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:49,880
Like, listen to some of these fucking people.

290
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,840
Bitch how do you not know the stars on your own flag?

291
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,800
I knew that shit when I was like 8 years old.

292
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,120
I'm a fucking Canadian.

293
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:02,240
What ocean is on the east side of the United States?

294
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,680
You guys know this.

295
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,080
What ocean is on the east side of the United States?

296
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:18,840
You don't know the oceans?

297
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,560
You never had that world geo class with the little worksheet?

298
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,800
What country is the queen of England from?

299
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,680
I'm not a policy guy.

300
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,680
I don't know.

301
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,680
I don't know.

302
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,680
I really don't know.

303
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
Just take a guess.

304
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,680
Like, what country is the queen of England from?

305
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,680
Europe.

306
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,680
I don't fucking know.

307
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,560
It's in the fucking name, you doofus.

308
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,280
What's the capital of the United States?

309
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,360
Um, the, um, there's a capital?

310
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
What?

311
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,360
Lexi.

312
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
Take a guess.

313
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,960
Um, um, I don't know, probably California.

314
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
That's right.

315
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
It is?

316
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
No.

317
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
The United States.

318
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
Do we know?

319
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
Stop!

320
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
I knew he was going to embarrass us.

321
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
I know.

322
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Wait.

323
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
I didn't want to think because I don't want to say I'm dead.

324
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,080
Just give it some thought.

325
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
Deep breath.

326
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
Capital of the United States.

327
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
Exhale.

328
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,080
There's no capital of the United States.

329
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,080
Yeah, literally.

330
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
Is there no capital?

331
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,080
Correct.

332
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,080
Was that right?

333
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,080
No.

334
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Oh, fuck.

335
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
You guys are UCLA students?

336
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
We literally go to UCLA.

337
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Yeah.

338
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,320
Where do you think the capital riots you've been shitting yourself for the past few years

339
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
have even happened?

340
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
Dude, come on!

341
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,560
What group of people did the Nazis target?

342
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,320
Oh, why is it bad Nazis?

343
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,600
Um, kids.

344
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,320
Oh my fucking god.

345
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,400
This is when you're so retarded that the idea of the Nazis bothers you, but you don't even

346
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,160
know why they're bad.

347
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,280
Can you name the three Kardashian sisters?

348
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,960
Kim, Kourtney, and Khloe.

349
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,880
What are the three Kardashian sisters' names?

350
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,480
Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe.

351
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,000
Bonus points for the brother?

352
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,240
Um, Robert.

353
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,000
The Kardashians' brother's name.

354
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What?

355
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Rob.

356
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Fuck me, dude.

357
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
We're doomed.

358
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah, I know.

359
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Every generation says this about the kids coming up, but I was never this stupid.

360
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,520
I could answer all these questions before I was in high school.

361
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
No problem.

362
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
No sweat.

363
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,600
So, um, y'all sure you don't want to make college more accessible?

364
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Just checking.

365
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
No, Shaniqua.

366
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
I don't want to make college more accessible.

367
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,680
These people didn't get any benefit from fucking high school.

368
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,160
What benefit are they going to get from college?

369
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,560
Some people just don't make it, man.

370
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,440
I remember being a kid, I remember there was this one kid who was, like, eating glue.

371
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,880
I was in kindergarten, even then, I went to him and I was like, dude, why are you eating

372
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
the glue?

373
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
Don't you know that's awful for you?

374
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,160
And he looked up in this snot-covered haze and he was like, mmm, tastes good.

375
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,400
That's your average fucking person, dude, led around by their immediate base impulses

376
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,140
with no conception of the future.

377
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,160
Even if we sent these failures off to college, what do you think they'd learn there?

378
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,120
Maybe they'd get themselves a gender studies degree, go eat the Play-Doh in the campus

379
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,400
pride safe space?

380
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,800
This is why we've got people clamoring for historical novels and old movies and shit

381
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,120
to be censored for a modern fucking audience.

382
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,120
Because the people that make up a modern fucking audience can't stand being even slightly

383
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
uncomfortable.

384
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,540
I can't show you this video because she's deleted it.

385
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,720
As far as I can find, there's only screencaps of what happened.

386
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,120
But this Zoomer did the whole thing where you dance over some unrelated music with a

387
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,120
caption.

388
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,740
This one's saying, our generation isn't soft.

389
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,740
You're just racist and homophobic.

390
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah, bitch, then why don't you turn off the comments if you're not soft?

391
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,500
I've said this many times about many different people, many different types of people.

392
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,960
My stalwart consistency on this topic has gotten me in trouble with my own fans, in

393
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
fact.

394
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
I am correct here.

395
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,560
If internet pushback makes you block people or disable comments or cry and run away and

396
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,160
log off, you're soft.

397
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,220
That's just how it is.

398
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,640
Because the real world is a whole lot harsher than mean words on a screen.

399
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,600
The Zoomers will never have their communist revolution no matter how much they cry about

400
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,480
it because they have to go to therapy to learn how to order a pizza over the fucking phone.

401
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,940
And getting called the wrong pronoun gives them a panic attack.

402
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,400
There's no way they're overthrowing a state.

403
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,680
I know, I know, I'm on yet another old man dev rant.

404
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,640
I guess that's just my lot in life now.

405
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,000
But again, at least with previous generational shifts, there was a reason for that superior

406
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,400
attitude of young people.

407
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
They were more capable.

408
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,280
They knew how to use that new technology.

409
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,880
They were the future of progress.

410
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,900
That's not the Zoomers.

411
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,760
Their skills have actually regressed.

412
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,340
Your average millennial can change out the RAM in a PC.

413
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,640
Your average boomer can change out the spark plug in a car.

414
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,600
Do you think your average Zoomer can do either of those things?

415
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,280
Zoomers are the ultimate paradox.

416
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,080
They're tethered to modern technology, and that technology is actually destroying them.

417
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,480
Sargon did an excellent video about that over at the Lotus Eaters.

418
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,680
But unlike with previous generations, they aren't even getting the other side of that

419
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
Faustian bargain.

420
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,060
They're not even acquiring the benefit of superior knowledge and skill that comes with

421
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,060
new technology.

422
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,600
Instead, they're getting dumber.

423
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,460
Because rather than learning about how the technology that dominates their lives actually

424
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,440
functions so that they can one day become its masters, they're simply submitting to

425
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,040
it because it's more convenient to be a coomer and a consumer than it is to understand and

426
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,360
create.
