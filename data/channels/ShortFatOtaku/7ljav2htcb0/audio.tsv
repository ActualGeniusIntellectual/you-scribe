0	9480	Yes, I must admit, I am a Linus Tech Tips cuck.
9480	13880	The politics of his employees are insufferably progressive, while Linus himself doesn't
13880	16920	seem to understand politics beyond surface level Good Things Good.
16920	18840	But darn it, his videos are actually really fun.
18840	22360	I'm a tinkerer and a tech head myself, so I'm pretty much the target audience for
22360	23640	most of the stuff he puts out.
23640	27140	However, I don't have the time to watch his podcast, The Wan Show, so I tend to only
27140	28840	check out the clips that really interest me.
28840	32760	And this one, Never Build a PC for Family, really interested me.
58840	62360	Okay, so here's the situation.
62360	68200	I built a PC for someone back inâ€¦ wait, this can't be right.
68200	70200	I think I know who this is.
70200	74240	Okay, well, whatever, it was a while ago, it was a couple months ago or something like
74240	75240	that.
75240	79600	In February, early February, I get a message, I'm just wondering how to get my monitor
79600	83240	to 144 hertz, because apparently it's 60 right now.
83240	90800	I kind of go, all right, it was definitely at 144 when I gave it to you, which is all
90800	92440	I care about.
92440	100640	This is one of those situations where the PC wasn't free, but it was very not retail,
100640	103580	if you know what I mean.
103580	108700	There was some wheeling and dealing that happened to make sure that this person who was a family
108700	114580	friend definitely got something a lot better than they would have walked out of Best Buy
114580	115580	with.
115580	116580	Sure.
116580	120300	So as far as I'm concerned, I have done my good deed already.
120300	121780	Business over, yeah.
121780	125680	Our transaction is now complete.
125680	128380	So I kind of go, are you using HDMI or DisplayPort?
128380	130900	HDMI may be stuck at a lower refresh rate.
130900	131900	Basic troubleshooting.
131900	132900	Yep.
132900	133900	I don't know what that means.
133900	135900	Sorry, how can I check?
135900	139140	And I kind of go, you're going to have to look up how to check.
139140	140140	Use Google.
140140	141140	Okay.
141140	143260	All right.
143260	148160	Two weeks later, I've been having problems connecting my headset mic.
148160	149660	When I checked, it's not registering.
149660	151020	It doesn't say the model of headset.
151020	152660	Here, I'll show it to you screenshot.
152660	154340	I'm like, I don't know.
154340	157420	If I was in front of it, I might be able to figure it out, but you might just have to
157420	159100	find some troubleshooting guides.
159100	168700	I get no fewer than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 messages over the next three
168700	171500	days.
171500	179420	That go as far as, okay, I really think this is urgent.
179420	180420	Please reply to this quickly.
180420	183780	I can't do anything on my PC.
183780	194760	I'm sitting here going, what's my incentive to do a favor for anyone at that point?
194760	198100	If you're anything like me, you've probably experienced this too, back when you lived
198100	199100	at home.
199100	202420	The minute you reveal that you know anything about technology, suddenly you're the one
202420	206300	on the hook doing free work for every single person in your extended family.
206300	209020	Oh yeah, my son's really good with computers.
209020	211220	I see him playing video games all the time.
211220	214740	Of course he'll come over and set up your laptop and your home network with your printer
214740	216980	and your TV's new surround sound system.
216980	219900	Second cousin we see like once a year, he'd be happy to do it.
219900	222640	No payment required.
222640	226760	And of course, if anything goes wrong, even 10 years later, it's your fault.
226760	227760	You screwed it up.
227760	230300	They're completely right to be angry at you because you were supposed to handle it.
230300	233860	No, it couldn't be all the fucking viruses they installed on their machine, from going
233860	238620	to porn sites or installing the new episode of the latest boomer TV show, .exe.
238620	239620	It has to be you.
239700	241780	Heaven forbid this happened to you when you were a kid.
241780	245380	Boomers always believed that a family computer couldn't possibly be fucked up by all the
245380	248200	weird toolbars and bonsai buddies they installed.
248200	250260	It had to be the fact that you were playing video games on it.
250260	254020	I even experienced the weirder, lesser known variant of this.
254020	257660	The idea that playing console games on a TV would damage the TV.
257660	259220	It's just a picture signal, dude.
259220	260580	How the hell is it any different from cable?
260580	262220	But these are all millennial stories.
262220	265980	And we're old people now, apparently, complaining about how people even older than us used to
265980	268700	treat us with regards to new technology back when we were kids.
268780	271300	And there's sort of a through line here with technological advancement.
271300	274740	Since I would guess the start of the industrial revolution, no we're not talking about Uncle
274740	278820	Ted today, the rate of technological change has been significantly faster than before.
278820	282540	In the before times, you might have had to get used to a new innovation like once a generation
282540	286900	or something, when somebody invents a slightly better medieval weapon or a way to use a draft
286900	287940	animal or some shit.
287940	292500	But once we started using science to build machines to accomplish jobs for us, the paradigm
292500	295580	of labor has completely changed every generation.
295580	299620	This necessitated each person acquiring a completely new set of skills than even what
299620	303620	their parents had learned, and each generation having a completely different sense of what
303620	305780	should be considered common knowledge.
305780	306900	Music is an obvious example.
306900	310340	Back in the day, you had to have people who could actually play music right there if you
310340	311340	wanted to hear it.
311340	314300	In 1896, the pneumatic piano player was invented.
314300	317180	You know what I mean, that piano with the cartridge in the front with a roll and a bunch
317180	319900	of notches in it, where when you activated the machine, the roll would feed through the
319900	322780	device and the notches would trigger mechanisms to play the piano on its own?
322780	325600	With this invention, you didn't need somebody present to actually play the piano.
325600	327700	You simply needed the roll with the song that you want.
327700	329820	You install it in the piano and then let it play itself.
329820	334220	The record player was invented earlier as the phonograph in 1877, but the quality of
334220	338620	music it produced was far inferior initially, and the first records were made out of tinfoil,
338620	340460	not wax, making them extremely fragile.
340460	344500	It only really began to take off after the tech improved enough in the early 20th century.
344500	347900	Now you don't need a whole-ass piano playing a giant reel, you need your turntable and
347900	348900	a record.
348900	353720	Story goes for the 8-track, the cassette, the CD, the MP3, and now streaming services.
353720	358540	Each one is a new way of saving a prior musical recording for future consumption, divided
358540	363220	by generation, and the knowledge required to use, appreciate, and create each medium
363220	366260	is, for the most part, specialized to that generation.
366260	370180	This same divide exists with pretty much all entertainment media, movies, shows, games,
370180	371180	books.
371180	374300	It exists with vehicles, it exists with fashion sense and food taste and employment.
374300	378220	Hell, my parents still struggle with their own smart TV, and I'm regularly employed
378220	381540	to set up whatever movie we're watching whenever I visit, even though I rarely go
381540	384620	back to my hometown and they know they're set up way better than I do.
384620	389100	A core component of modernity is the rate of technological advancement is so fast that
389100	393500	the previous generation's knowledge and rules about how the world is becomes obsolete
393500	398040	much faster than before, hence the phenomenon of my generation running rings around our
398040	399840	parents with computers and the internet.
399840	404260	The millennial experience is one of actually getting away with shit online when we were
404260	407860	kids, from pirating TV shows or games on the family computer, to downloading porn on a
407860	411020	file-sharing program when you're really too young to be watching porn.
411020	414500	Parents always have their values and their rules, and kids always chafe against those
414500	416140	values and rules as they get older.
416140	417140	That's pretty normal.
417140	420320	But technology gave kids the decisive victory in that fight.
420320	423660	What hope do parents have about smarting their kids on the internet when they can barely
423660	426540	set up the speed dial on their first non-rotary phone?
426540	430540	However, what Linus is talking about here actually isn't about helping an older relative
430540	431540	with new technology.
431540	433340	It's about helping a younger one.
433340	434340	Yeah, seriously.
434340	435340	Listen to this.
435340	439980	I feel like this is one of those, am I the a**hole things, right?
439980	445260	For basically just saying, so my response to this wall of text is, sorry, I really can't
445260	446380	dig into issues like this.
446380	449100	If there's a problem, you'll have to shut it down for now and take it to a computer
449100	450100	shop.
450100	451880	Or you can try and fix it yourself.
451880	455980	I didn't have anyone to help me troubleshoot and things usually worked out okay.
455980	458760	Tongue, smiley face.
458760	463680	A little bit of sass on the end, a little bit of unnecessary sass on the end.
464360	465360	Here's the thing.
465360	466360	I mean, okay.
466360	468000	Have you, have you read these articles?
468000	472900	And I've heard anecdotally from some, a couple of people I've talked to this about recently,
472900	477000	one who's a teacher and one who worked in an office.
477000	480820	And I've read articles about this too, that apparently the younger generation in spite
480820	486880	of growing up with computers is entering the workplace with fewer functional computing
486880	487880	skills.
487880	491640	They grew up with less computer problems because things worked more often.
491640	494180	So that's the thing, right?
494180	496200	Is this just tough love?
496200	497800	That's that's what I thought I was doing.
497800	500840	Like, look, no, if you want to solve this, if you want to play video games, I didn't
500840	503460	want to pry, but is this a younger person?
503460	504460	This is a younger person.
504460	505460	Yes.
505460	506460	So I got that vibe.
506460	507460	Yeah.
507460	511560	And in that case, I mean, I, it seems more fair.
511560	512560	I don't know.
512560	515920	Cause I mean, realistically, what do young people even do?
515920	517640	Honestly, you're done.
517640	521400	You're done your obligations for the day by like three o'clock.
521400	522400	Is that when school ends?
522400	523400	I don't even remember.
523400	524400	Yeah.
524400	525400	So figure it out.
525400	530440	Like, I, I, I'm not trying to be a jerk about it or anything, but that was how I learned.
530440	534760	The only reason that I'm doing this today that I know any of this stuff is because I
534760	540200	was highly motivated to fix my computer because I wanted to play video games.
540200	544320	This is something that I think I've intuitively known for a while, but it's weird to finally
544320	545640	hear somebody else say it.
545640	550280	The trend of younger generations being acclimated to newer technology and running circles around
550280	553160	older generations with it has seemingly been broken.
553160	555920	Zoomers actually do have less tech skill than millennials.
555920	558080	I think Luke's explanation is partially true.
558080	562020	That because things break down less nowadays, there's less incentive to become a tinkerer.
562020	566440	This kind of gives the back in my day boomer complaints a bit more credence that having
566440	570960	to deal with the hardships of older non-functioning technology gave you a deeper understanding
570960	573520	of how it worked to stay on the computer topic.
573520	576560	Overclocking back in the day meant fiddling with jumpers on the motherboard, including
576560	579840	together water cooling components out of aquarium parts.
579880	583600	Clocking nowadays means going into the BIOS, changing a few settings, and making sure your
583600	585000	AIO can handle the load.
585000	588400	It's just easier, and that's great for people who are sick of doing it the old way, but
588400	592800	it also doesn't lend itself to new people coming into the space and truly understanding
592800	595320	what they're doing whenever they change that setting in a menu.
595320	596320	It's not just that, though.
596320	600320	It's also because devices are way more black box than they used to be.
600320	601520	Black box is a computer term.
601520	605480	It means a system which can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs, without any knowledge
605480	606600	of its internal workings.
606600	610840	To somebody who is not knowledgeable about computers, data goes in, data appears on the
610840	611840	screen.
611840	612840	How does it work?
612840	613840	Who knows?
613840	614840	It's a black box.
614840	619080	Manufacturers of modern technology are incentivized to create black box devices.
619080	620680	This is done through two strategies.
620680	624720	One, you make the innards of the device as hard as possible to actually access by the
624720	625720	average person.
625720	630280	Two, you incentivize people thinking in black box terms, like their phone is just a magic
630280	634240	brick that does stuff, and its mechanisms are truly unknowable by the human mind.
634240	638000	They do this because it allows them to upcharge for the device by pretending it's more complicated
638000	639000	than it actually is.
639000	642280	It allows them to upcharge for repairs of the device because you don't even know how
642280	643280	to fix it.
643280	645480	So how do you know what parts or labor even costs?
645480	648040	And it allows them to control what you do with the device.
648040	651020	This is what is meant by the Apple ecosystem, for example.
651020	654760	Why you need to use specific approved apps on Apple devices.
654760	657920	Because unlike with a PC that you've built yourself, you're locked out of the backend,
657920	659440	the foundational level of the hardware.
659440	661960	You have to play within the confines of Apple software.
661960	665200	And anything they don't give you access to might as well not even exist.
665200	666920	Unless of course, you backdoor it.
666920	671240	This is why various conversations like the right to repair your own device, or the legality
671240	675520	of rooting your phone and installing your own base software on it, are hot button topics
675520	676840	in tech circles right now.
676840	681080	There's power in controlling how the user uses your device after you've sold it to them.
681080	684800	And people who tinker, whether that's installing Homebrew on a console, or running a new OS
684800	688640	on a phone, have routinely been caught in the crosshairs of big corpos.
688640	693080	All of this is to say that the technology zoomers have grown up with is extremely reliable
693080	694160	and convenient.
694160	698760	And with those benefits has also come both increasing corporate control and the gradual
698760	701480	shift away from learning how your stuff actually works.
701480	703080	Because most of the time you just don't need to know.
703080	706720	Your average zoomer might be able to pull out his phone and play a game, or access the
706720	707720	internet, or record a video.
707720	711780	But if you ask them to install an app that Apple or Google didn't want them to install
711780	715680	by jailbreaking the device and running a sideloader or something, they'd look at you like your
715680	716680	head was on funny.
716680	717680	Why would you ever do that?
717720	720960	In fact, this whole thing reminds me of a viral tweet my friend Tina put out a little
720960	721960	bit ago.
721960	725180	An article on Variety.com claims that the Netflix password crackdown has driven the
725180	727580	highest rate of Netflix signups in years.
727580	732120	The common knowledge of my generation said that, due to increasing tech savviness, people
732120	735760	would largely return to piracy in the face of Netflix's crackdown.
735760	737920	Joke's on you fucks, I never left.
737920	741760	But the reason that Netflix went out initially was because its extreme convenience won out
741760	745320	over the relatively complicated piracy methods of 10-15 years ago.
745320	747160	Go watch my video on Netflix for more info on that.
747160	752320	Our lord and savior Gaben, the owner of Steam, rightfully said that piracy is a service problem,
752320	753320	not a pricing problem.
753320	756520	In other words, people pirate your game not because it's too expensive, but because
756520	758840	it was too inconvenient to get legally.
758840	760280	And he's largely correct.
760280	761700	Netflix was convenient.
761700	765080	Every show available for streaming legally on one platform, one fee, watch anywhere?
765080	766080	Sounds great.
766080	769540	But as streaming became less and less convenient, conventional knowledge predicted that piracy
769540	771760	would return, and that didn't actually happen.
771760	775320	Tina replied to this article with a quip, the children lack the knowledge to torrent,
775320	776320	we have failed.
776320	778160	It's a joke, but it's also true.
778160	782360	Torrenting's even easier now than it was before, with one-click magnet links.
782360	786560	And yet simply signing up, signing in, and flopping on the couch makes Netflix the most
786560	791340	convenient choice, especially among a generation with less technical prowess like the zoomers.
791340	795280	Some zoomers, in fact, took being called out for their lack of skill very poorly.
795280	798000	30-year-olds on Twitter are so annoying about torrenting.
798000	800920	I don't know, Amanda, is that like the new Karen or something?
800920	804180	Maybe a lot of people just figure it's worth spending a little money to not have the hassle
804180	808180	of torrenting something or to watch it on the big TV through the PlayStation or whatever.
808180	811420	You can still watch a torrented file on the big TV through a variety of different methods
811420	813760	like listen to this bitch, she sounds like a fucking grandma.
813760	814760	What happened?
814760	817180	You're supposed to make me look like a tech boomer, way more than I already do with my
817180	818180	own fumblings.
818180	821100	You should be schooling me on this, why are you so fucking weak?
821100	824660	When you look at all the technological marvels around you, is there not even a single bit
824660	825660	of curiosity?
825660	828920	Like, oh, I wonder how that gadget works, maybe I should tinker with it and learn a
828920	829920	little bit.
829920	831560	Do you even have a spark of consciousness?
831560	834660	This is about people who whine about company policies but still pay for its products as
834660	835840	if they can't live without them.
835840	838920	It's completely understandable with basic modern necessities, but you can survive the
838920	841480	inconvenience of pirating or just not watching or playing something.
841480	842480	No, it's not.
842480	846440	It's about grouchy people approaching middle age complaining about the kids these days.
846440	848560	You see, it is actually a generational thing.
848560	851980	They think that millennials are out of touch, but not because we've fallen out of touch
851980	855600	like previous generations have with new technology, but because they've remained ignorant.
855600	860400	They don't even have a new canon of knowledge that corresponds with their new technology
860400	865100	to replace my old out-of-touch canon like previous generations did, unless the ever-expanding
865100	867920	database of new genders and pronouns counts anyway.
867920	889880	Like, listen to some of these fucking people.
889880	891840	Bitch how do you not know the stars on your own flag?
891840	893800	I knew that shit when I was like 8 years old.
893800	895120	I'm a fucking Canadian.
895120	902240	What ocean is on the east side of the United States?
902240	907680	You guys know this.
907680	912080	What ocean is on the east side of the United States?
912080	918840	You don't know the oceans?
918840	921560	You never had that world geo class with the little worksheet?
921560	923800	What country is the queen of England from?
923800	926680	I'm not a policy guy.
926680	927680	I don't know.
927680	928680	I don't know.
928680	929680	I really don't know.
929680	930680	Just take a guess.
930680	932680	Like, what country is the queen of England from?
932680	933680	Europe.
933680	934680	I don't fucking know.
934680	936560	It's in the fucking name, you doofus.
936560	938280	What's the capital of the United States?
938280	942360	Um, the, um, there's a capital?
942360	943360	What?
943360	944360	Lexi.
944360	945360	Take a guess.
945360	950960	Um, um, I don't know, probably California.
950960	951960	That's right.
951960	952960	It is?
952960	953960	No.
953960	954960	The United States.
954960	955960	Do we know?
955960	956960	Stop!
956960	957960	I knew he was going to embarrass us.
957960	958960	I know.
958960	959960	Wait.
959960	960960	I didn't want to think because I don't want to say I'm dead.
960960	963080	Just give it some thought.
963080	964080	Deep breath.
964080	965080	Capital of the United States.
965080	966080	Exhale.
966080	967080	There's no capital of the United States.
967080	968080	Yeah, literally.
968080	969080	Is there no capital?
969080	970080	Correct.
970080	971080	Was that right?
971080	972080	No.
972080	973080	Oh, fuck.
973080	974080	You guys are UCLA students?
974080	975080	We literally go to UCLA.
975800	976800	Yeah.
976800	979320	Where do you think the capital riots you've been shitting yourself for the past few years
979320	980320	have even happened?
980320	981320	Dude, come on!
981320	983560	What group of people did the Nazis target?
983560	986320	Oh, why is it bad Nazis?
986320	987600	Um, kids.
987600	989320	Oh my fucking god.
989320	993400	This is when you're so retarded that the idea of the Nazis bothers you, but you don't even
993400	995160	know why they're bad.
995160	998280	Can you name the three Kardashian sisters?
998280	1000960	Kim, Kourtney, and Khloe.
1000960	1003880	What are the three Kardashian sisters' names?
1003880	1006480	Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe.
1006480	1008000	Bonus points for the brother?
1008000	1009240	Um, Robert.
1009240	1011000	The Kardashians' brother's name.
1011000	1012000	What?
1012000	1013000	Rob.
1013000	1014000	Fuck me, dude.
1014000	1015000	We're doomed.
1015000	1016000	Yeah, I know.
1016000	1017000	Every generation says this about the kids coming up, but I was never this stupid.
1017000	1019520	I could answer all these questions before I was in high school.
1019520	1020520	No problem.
1020520	1021520	No sweat.
1021520	1025600	So, um, y'all sure you don't want to make college more accessible?
1025600	1026600	Just checking.
1026600	1027600	No, Shaniqua.
1027600	1028600	I don't want to make college more accessible.
1028600	1030680	These people didn't get any benefit from fucking high school.
1030680	1032160	What benefit are they going to get from college?
1032160	1033560	Some people just don't make it, man.
1034240	1036440	I remember being a kid, I remember there was this one kid who was, like, eating glue.
1036440	1039880	I was in kindergarten, even then, I went to him and I was like, dude, why are you eating
1039880	1040880	the glue?
1040880	1041880	Don't you know that's awful for you?
1041880	1046160	And he looked up in this snot-covered haze and he was like, mmm, tastes good.
1046160	1050400	That's your average fucking person, dude, led around by their immediate base impulses
1050400	1052140	with no conception of the future.
1052140	1055160	Even if we sent these failures off to college, what do you think they'd learn there?
1055160	1058120	Maybe they'd get themselves a gender studies degree, go eat the Play-Doh in the campus
1058120	1059400	pride safe space?
1059400	1062800	This is why we've got people clamoring for historical novels and old movies and shit
1062840	1065120	to be censored for a modern fucking audience.
1065120	1069120	Because the people that make up a modern fucking audience can't stand being even slightly
1069120	1070120	uncomfortable.
1070120	1071540	I can't show you this video because she's deleted it.
1071540	1073720	As far as I can find, there's only screencaps of what happened.
1073720	1077120	But this Zoomer did the whole thing where you dance over some unrelated music with a
1077120	1078120	caption.
1078120	1079740	This one's saying, our generation isn't soft.
1079740	1080740	You're just racist and homophobic.
1080740	1083000	Yeah, bitch, then why don't you turn off the comments if you're not soft?
1083000	1086500	I've said this many times about many different people, many different types of people.
1086500	1090960	My stalwart consistency on this topic has gotten me in trouble with my own fans, in
1090960	1091960	fact.
1092120	1093120	I am correct here.
1093120	1097560	If internet pushback makes you block people or disable comments or cry and run away and
1097560	1099160	log off, you're soft.
1099160	1100220	That's just how it is.
1100220	1103640	Because the real world is a whole lot harsher than mean words on a screen.
1103640	1106600	The Zoomers will never have their communist revolution no matter how much they cry about
1106600	1110480	it because they have to go to therapy to learn how to order a pizza over the fucking phone.
1110480	1112940	And getting called the wrong pronoun gives them a panic attack.
1112940	1114400	There's no way they're overthrowing a state.
1114400	1117680	I know, I know, I'm on yet another old man dev rant.
1117680	1119640	I guess that's just my lot in life now.
1119640	1124000	But again, at least with previous generational shifts, there was a reason for that superior
1124000	1125400	attitude of young people.
1125400	1126400	They were more capable.
1126400	1128280	They knew how to use that new technology.
1128280	1129880	They were the future of progress.
1129880	1130900	That's not the Zoomers.
1130900	1132760	Their skills have actually regressed.
1132760	1135340	Your average millennial can change out the RAM in a PC.
1135340	1137640	Your average boomer can change out the spark plug in a car.
1137640	1140600	Do you think your average Zoomer can do either of those things?
1140600	1142280	Zoomers are the ultimate paradox.
1142280	1146080	They're tethered to modern technology, and that technology is actually destroying them.
1146080	1148480	Sargon did an excellent video about that over at the Lotus Eaters.
1148480	1151680	But unlike with previous generations, they aren't even getting the other side of that
1151680	1152680	Faustian bargain.
1152680	1156060	They're not even acquiring the benefit of superior knowledge and skill that comes with
1156060	1157060	new technology.
1157060	1158600	Instead, they're getting dumber.
1158600	1161460	Because rather than learning about how the technology that dominates their lives actually
1161460	1165440	functions so that they can one day become its masters, they're simply submitting to
1165440	1170040	it because it's more convenient to be a coomer and a consumer than it is to understand and
1170040	1170360	create.
