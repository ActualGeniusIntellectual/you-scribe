1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,380
So, while everyone's attention was turned towards VidCon this past weekend, and the

2
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,880
absolute shitshow that erupted there, something else was happening at about the same time.

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,080
Something that I personally believe to be equally as important to the conversation of

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,360
free speech, fair use, and ethical conduct as Sargon getting called a garbage human for

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,240
simply sitting quietly at Anita Sarkeesian's panel and listening to her talk.

6
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,520
This is actually the sort of thing I expected all of the usual skeptical suspects to cover,

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,840
and to my surprise, I don't think anyone's talked about it yet.

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,620
I'm not blaming them, of course, they were busy.

9
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,760
But this is pretty important, so I guess it's left up to me.

10
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,260
Let's discuss the curious case of Alex Maurer.

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:56,220
Star Maser DSP is an arcade-style spacecraft shoot-'em-up that recalls the glory days

12
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,940
of games like Gradius, Phalanx, and Zero Wing.

13
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,900
Being a 2016 indie game, it's got that hyper-smooth pixel style that seems to be trending right

14
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,900
now.

15
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,140
It raised $200,000 on Kickstarter, and was first pushed to the forefront of people's

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,940
attention when the early access demo hit Steam in August of 2016.

17
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:18,100
I haven't played it myself, and I'm not a super-huge fan of the genre, but from the

18
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,140
gameplay videos I can find, it looks to be a polished, lovingly-made, serviceable entry

19
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,380
into the shmup genre.

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,580
Maybe a bit repetitive, but that's more of a failing of the genre rather than Star

21
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,940
Maser DSP itself.

22
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,300
For a while, all was well and good with Star Maser DSP.

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,440
And then suddenly, people from all across the internet began getting hit with copyright

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,500
strikes for their reviews and let's plays of the game.

25
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,340
And not from Imago Softworks, the indie dev that created Star Maser DSP, but rather Alex

26
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,380
Maurer, the composer of the game's music and sound effects.

27
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,580
Alex Maurer, before this incident, had made a name for herself as a composer.

28
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,980
She'd worked on games like Death Road to Canada, Spy Hunter, Need for Speed, Serious Sam, and

29
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,900
Penny Arcade's On the Rain Slick Precipice of Darkness.

30
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,500
She'd also worked on multiple short films as well.

31
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,260
And according to her Wikipedia page, she'd actually released an album designed to be

32
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,340
played on NES, using an NES cartridge.

33
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,340
Cool.

34
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,920
Maurer was contracted to do the soundtrack for Star Maser, in which she was paid monthly

35
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,300
until the work was completed.

36
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,140
However, due to reasons that have understandably been kept private, Maurer was released from

37
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,180
her contract with Imago Softworks before the work was complete.

38
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,180
Due to non-disclosure agreements and the general state of the game's industry, I don't think

39
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,860
we'll ever find out exactly why Maurer was let go.

40
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,480
But I think we can extrapolate from what I'm about to show you in this video a pretty accurate

41
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,940
picture of the situation.

42
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,560
Maurer claims that the contract she signed was legally binding to a game called Star

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,260
Maser, not Star Maser DSP, and that because she was let go before she completed the work,

44
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,300
all of the music and sound effects in Star Maser DSP are her own intellectual property,

45
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,300
and that it is her right to levy a copyright strike against any YouTuber or streamer that

46
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,620
plays Star Maser DSP on their shows.

47
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,740
However, if we take a peek at Maurer's contract, which has actually made the rounds on the

48
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,300
internet, we can see that the contract specifically states that her position is work-for-hire,

49
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,060
meaning that any content she creates under this contract is explicitly owned by Imago

50
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,180
Softworks, not Maurer personally.

51
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,820
Furthermore, Imago Softworks' position on this contract is that it covers both Star

52
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,780
Maser and all related Star Maser products, like Star Maser DSP.

53
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,180
Maurer's counter position is that, because she was released from the contract early,

54
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,700
without completion of said contract, that those stipulations are null and void, that

55
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,220
the music is owned by her.

56
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,080
And using that line of reasoning, Maurer began issuing copyright strikes to YouTubers and

57
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,240
streamers playing Star Maser DSP on their channels and shows.

58
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,780
Her logic was that because the music in the game was her intellectual property, and that

59
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,540
because the content creators in question failed to obtain permission from her personally,

60
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,420
her only legal recourse of action to protect her intellectual property was to use the Digital

61
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,260
Millennium Copyright Act, or the DMCA.

62
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,620
Maurer began to file false DMCA claims to what would ultimately be over 100 YouTube

63
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,340
channels and just as many, if not more, Twitch streams using each service's auto-claim process.

64
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,640
And we all know how unforgiving this shit can be at times.

65
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,660
Content ID is bad enough, where Scattershot matches auto-claim videos, even when the holder

66
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,100
of the copyright doesn't want them to be claimed.

67
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,620
But on both of these platforms, somebody like Maurer can show up, file a claim, and it just

68
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,740
goes through.

69
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,300
Nobody at Twitch or YouTube actually looks at the claim, it's all automated, it just

70
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,080
goes through without a hitch, and it's on the channels involved to actually appeal them.

71
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,860
And these strikes are no laughing matter for anybody who seriously values their channel.

72
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,960
They constitute legal action that the platform must act upon in one way or another, and many

73
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,700
channels have vanished, never to return, due to both valid and invalid DMCA notices.

74
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,660
Many of the larger names that we all know and love, including Nintendo, Sega, Sony,

75
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,500
Konami, and so on, have automated strikes issued in their name.

76
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,100
I think every YouTuber, both large and small, has a story that they can tell about the DMCA,

77
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,620
but I'll just stick to my own personal one, just to give you a sense of scale.

78
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,460
Check this out, my gaming channel gets almost no traffic, I've got about 20 Twitch stream

79
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,060
regulars, whom I all appreciate very much, and just as many views per Let's Play episode

80
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,460
on YouTube on average.

81
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,540
Do you really think that somebody over at Nintendo of Japan is issuing Japanese language

82
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,340
copyright strikes on my 10 view Breath of the Wild Let's Play parts?

83
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,900
If so, I would absolutely hate to be the dude doing that job, but I'm pretty sure this

84
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,460
is all automated, with computers mass blanketing strikes wherever matches take them.

85
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,500
Over the course of the past week, as all of this was unfolding, I actually emailed Mauer

86
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,440
myself, to ask her exactly what was going on, but she didn't reply to me, probably

87
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,140
because I'm a 500 sub pleb.

88
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,580
However, a larger YouTuber by the name of Sid Alpha, who had also been watching the

89
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,700
drama unfold, did in fact get a reply from her.

90
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,700
Let's read it.

91
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,260
The fact that Temi Noko, one of the YouTubers hit by Mauer's DMCA clams, is directing

92
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,100
her complaints to me instead of the developer is a problem.

93
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,300
This seems to be a general response of those who were hit with DMCA strikes.

94
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,260
I did suggest to some who complained to me that I would reverse their DMCA strikes if

95
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,540
they were willing to redirect their complaints to the developer.

96
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,260
No one was willing to do so, and I no longer want to offer anyone the possibility of having

97
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,540
their DMCA strikes reversed.

98
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,540
Wow.

99
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,260
So this is what this sounds like to me.

100
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,580
Mauer, it sounds like you're pissed from being let go from Imajos Softworks.

101
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,640
It sounds like you believe you should still have that job and be paid the remaining money

102
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,860
from finishing the contract out.

103
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,740
And it sounds like, rather than keep your dispute between you and Imajos, you would

104
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,000
rather press-gang YouTubers into fighting for you in the court of public opinion, by

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,100
filing DMCA notifications against their videos, and then telling them to redirect their complaints

106
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,100
to Imajos.

107
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,180
Except Imajos didn't file the notification.

108
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,180
You did.

109
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,440
That's your name there on the strike.

110
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
Nobody else's.

111
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,140
Let's be charitable towards your interpretation of events, Alex.

112
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,820
Let's assume that Imajos Softworks let you go for a completely bullshit reason.

113
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,340
Let's assume that you're entirely innocent, and that you should have been able to complete

114
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,820
your work and get paid as promised.

115
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,420
Let's even assume that Imajos Softworks' actions towards you were illegal.

116
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,820
Why do you think that gives you the right to start issuing notifications against uninvolved

117
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,280
third parties?

118
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,940
What did you expect would happen here?

119
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,420
Did you expect streamers and let's players to just give in and go fight Imajos on your

120
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,420
behalf?

121
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,940
Did you want to frame this as a David and Goliath situation?

122
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,980
A poor video games composer versus the big bad company?

123
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,380
Forming her out into the street with little recourse?

124
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,620
Or maybe, did you want this to become a grassroots thing where mobs of people show up at Imagoza's

125
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,220
digital doorstep to fight for your cause?

126
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,300
Well, there's no fucking chance of that happening now, and then after you've threatened

127
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,360
their channels with copyright strikes.

128
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,460
Channels which, for some of these people, are their livelihoods.

129
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,020
You know what might have worked?

130
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,380
Alerting the games press.

131
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,020
Yeah, Kotaku and Polygon and the others are absolute shit-suckers.

132
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,880
But you're an indie woman apparently getting trampled by a company.

133
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,060
They'd lap that shit up.

134
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,500
They'd signal boost it among their crowd.

135
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,820
And you may have actually ended up with some support.

136
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:33,340
Or maybe contacting the YouTubers and streamers playing Star Mazer DSP without a DMCA claim

137
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,780
and informing them of the situation and asking them to help raise awareness.

138
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,860
Even a GoFundMe for your legal action would have probably worked.

139
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,620
All of these options were available to you, but you chose to pursue legal action against

140
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,620
uninvolved individuals.

141
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,540
I'd ask you why, but I think I have a pretty reasonable assumption here.

142
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,980
You don't really have a leg to stand on regarding your claims, and you know it.

143
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,480
There are legal consequences to filing a false DMCA claim.

144
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,220
Mauer lives in the USA, as do many of the people she's filed against, making the legalities

145
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,140
of the situation a bit more straightforward.

146
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:06,060
And I doubt she has the army of lawyers that a major game dev would use to stall countersuits

147
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,520
until they fizzle out.

148
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,820
If the use of content is covered by fair use laws, a DMCA claim is considered to be false.

149
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,660
And even if the use of content is not covered by fair use laws, a contract that Mauer signed

150
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,900
states that she does not actually own the content.

151
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,900
And a DMCA claim filed for content one doesn't own is also considered to be false.

152
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,620
Abuse of the DMCA does have legal consequences.

153
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,560
If Mauer's interpretation of the contract is upheld over the course of any legal battle

154
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,540
she undertakes with Imago Softworks, many of these strikes and claims will also be upheld

155
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,580
as legitimate.

156
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,860
But if Mauer's interpretation is not upheld, she has opened the door wide for many content

157
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,260
creators to set precedents regarding copyright law as it pertains to streams and let's plays,

158
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,480
as well as absolutely destroying herself financially and legally.

159
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,800
Either way, I think she's already destroyed herself professionally.

160
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,240
Despite her impressive body of work, I don't think anybody would ever dare hire her again.

161
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,600
However, as the week went on, rather than back down, apologize, delete Facebook, lawyer

162
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,360
up and hit the gym, Mauer decided instead to double down.

163
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,800
She began filing DMCAs against people who had done videos on Duck Game and Death Road

164
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,560
to Canada, games unrelated to the Imago debacle but ones that she did work on, as well as

165
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,840
sending a cease and desist to Turner Broadcasting due to their own involvement in Duck Game.

166
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
Holy shit.

167
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,280
Let's see what she actually has to say about it.

168
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,880
I don't have to give anyone permission to have my music be in their videos.

169
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,280
I told people to contact Imagos because Imagos is responsible for releasing a game that violated

170
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
copyright.

171
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,560
Also, I don't think that video recording yourself playing video games is a realistic job.

172
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,880
Creating video games is, and it is a very risky business to be in.

173
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,680
This is a continuation of her previous stance regarding her owning the rights to Starmazer

174
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,720
DSP's soundtrack, not Imagos.

175
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,800
But it's also a rebuke that many content creators face by a lot of less than charitable individuals.

176
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,640
That it's not a real job.

177
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,240
A job is what pays the bills.

178
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Period.

179
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,420
Alex, did you know that at one time, being involved in television wasn't considered

180
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,420
a job?

181
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,440
Or being involved in radio?

182
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,360
Did you know that at one time, people stood around in a field to watch very basic airplanes

183
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,280
fly about 40 or 50 feet, say to themselves, golly gee, isn't that something, but never

184
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,660
once considered that a multi-billion dollar industry would spring up from that innovation?

185
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,920
Every single time there's a new invention or new medium, there will be people who may

186
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:18,240
think that it's a novelty, but does not actually consist of any real work beyond hobbyism.

187
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Let me repeat, Alex, streaming and let's playing is not a real job to you.

188
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,960
Likely because you're 34 years old, and grew up in an environment where such a thing

189
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
was unthinkable.

190
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,120
Thankfully for the rest of us, we've moved beyond that.

191
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,040
And as a quick aside, TotalBiscuit got involved in all this bullshit too, quipping that, for

192
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,680
this not being a real job, it sure as hell can afford the lawyers that Alex's real

193
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,000
job seemingly can't.

194
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I love you bro.

195
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,120
TB decided to reach out to YouTube Gaming and Twitch using the clout of his own channel,

196
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,720
in order to help expedite some of the counterclaims filed by smaller channels against Maurer's

197
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
bullshit.

198
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,400
Additionally, a GoFundMe was set up to help pay for legal expenses against Maurer, which

199
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,640
hit $10,000 in under 24 hours.

200
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,560
It's still going by the way, so please go donate if you can.

201
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,120
At the time of recording this video, they need another 2,000 American, and I have confidence

202
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,680
that we can scrape it together.

203
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,640
Additionally, even though it's been a very long time since August 2014, the internet

204
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,440
still has no tolerance for unethical practices, and I'm personally absolutely proud of you

205
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
guys for that.

206
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,880
Here's Maurer addressing TemiNeko, the content creator she mentioned earlier as being one

207
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,800
of the ones she refused to back down on.

208
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,640
Thanks for helping me get death threats for doing nothing wrong.

209
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,200
These death threats are coming from people who have my address.

210
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,200
They are literally ruining my livelihood, as in whether or not I'm alive.

211
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
Happy?

212
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,360
Now of course, I don't think anybody should be sending actual fucking threats to anybody.

213
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,040
And man, if you're doing this sort of thing for the lulz or whatever, please stop.

214
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,040
But doesn't this whole thing sound familiar to any of you who went through gamergate?

215
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,160
Didn't Brianna Wu, Nita Sarkeesian, Zoe Quinn, and many others start complaining about this

216
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,400
type of shit as soon as they started getting seriously criticized for their unethical practices?

217
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,900
Maybe the call of victim bucks was just too seducing for Maurer to ignore.

218
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,040
But unlike the aforementioned fraudsters, there's probably not going to be much money

219
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,320
for Maurer in all of it.

220
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,980
She's destroyed absolutely everything around her to the point that even the SJW Gaming

221
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,040
cabal seems to be reluctant to get involved.

222
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,200
Over time, Maurer's comments on the topic began to become more and more deranged.

223
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,720
Fucking playing video games is not a job!

224
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,560
If there was a way to DMCA punch you in the face through my computer screen, I would.

225
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,520
You and your fucking friends do not have the right to post videos with my music.

226
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,680
The DMCA system exists so I can say no when the creepy fucking people like you are trying

227
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,120
to fuck my music.

228
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Fuck you.

229
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,280
This sounds like a 50-50 mix of a grumpy old father who doesn't approve of his kid's

230
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,480
career choice and a whining child who's throwing a tantrum when things don't go her way.

231
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,400
Another YouTuber by the name of Musical Anti-Hero managed to get a hold of Alex Maurer and conduct

232
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,560
an interview regarding this whole Star Mazer DSP debacle.

233
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,680
There was honestly nothing too special about it.

234
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,400
Musical Anti-Hero brought up the same points that many others brought up regarding the

235
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,080
use of DMCA, YouTubing being a legitimate source of income, and so on.

236
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,720
Maurer, of course, restated her positions.

237
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,800
But the video Musical Anti-Hero did on the interview was, you guessed it, hit with a

238
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,680
copyright claim by Alex Maurer.

239
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,140
The video itself had none of Maurer's content, and none of Imajos' content in it.

240
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,400
It was entirely Musical Anti-Hero's content.

241
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,480
What was Maurer's twisted reasoning this time?

242
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,000
He used an old photograph from before my gender transition in his video.

243
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,520
It's an extremely sensitive issue for trans people.

244
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,840
I asked him to take it down and he said he would.

245
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,920
Over 12 hours later it was still up, so I decided to report it.

246
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,880
The photo came from my camera and I technically owned the copyright.

247
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,320
Are you fucking kidding me?

248
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,800
I don't care that Alex Maurer turned out to be trans.

249
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,240
She apparently goes by Niki Maurer sometimes, but still seems to use Alex.

250
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,200
It's a gender neutral name anyway, and it's ultimately a non-issue.

251
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,000
And I understand why it may be sensitive to have pre-transition photos thrown about

252
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,640
when you're trans, even though Maurer uploaded said photo herself.

253
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,540
And I'm not even interested in arguing her trans status, even though transtrenders are

254
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,880
absolutely a thing, gender questioning and confused individuals are absolutely a thing,

255
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,400
and just blatantly faking trans status for SJW support is absolutely a thing.

256
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,880
But an individual's face is not automatically protected by copyright.

257
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,820
That is not a right that you intrinsically have simply for owning your own face.

258
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,100
And showing a pre-transition photo is clearly not justification for abuse of the DMCA.

259
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,940
It's about at this point in the story that Imogos just got fucking fed up with the whole

260
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,940
thing.

261
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,300
Imogos began to move forward with legal action against Maurer, stating in a Twitter PM that

262
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,360
"...we have become represented by Leonard French in this case and we intend to litigate.

263
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,100
We are seeking absolutely no damages in this action, only a court-ordered establishment

264
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,200
of our queer defined rights chain and subsequently the place in that chain for YouTubers who

265
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
have been affected."

266
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,940
Leonard French, the attorney hired by Imogos, as well as the one behind the GoFundMe intended

267
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,940
to help protect content creators affected by Maurer, released this statement on behalf

268
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,420
of Don Thacker of Imogos.

269
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,400
"...it is with a heavy heart that I announce that we have a plan to help the community

270
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,580
and Imogos through the legal gauntlet that Alex Maurer has set for us.

271
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,980
We feel it is our duty and responsibility to do what we can to mitigate the damage Alex

272
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,980
has caused."

273
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,560
Don's journey with Alex began seven years ago when he met her at PAX East after asking

274
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,900
her to work on one of his films.

275
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,600
They quickly became friends.

276
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,900
Her talent and skill as a musician and artist was readily apparent.

277
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,740
Don and Alex worked on several titles together over the years.

278
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,300
In 2015, Don saw the opportunity to create Starmazer, a dream he had since he was nine

279
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,300
years old.

280
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,500
Don asked Alex to create the music and sound effects assets for the game.

281
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,020
The Kickstarter, the development, the team, it was all a dream come true.

282
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,340
But then Alex's behavior began to change.

283
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,780
Slowly at first, it had become what you have seen publicly recently.

284
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,660
Don tried to keep the matter as quiet as possible out of respect for Alex and in the hope that

285
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,380
the situation would be resolved peacefully, amicably, and to the benefit of everyone.

286
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,860
Unfortunately, the copyright system in the United States has allowed her to assert rights

287
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,080
that she does not actually own, and her assertion of those rights has caused Imigos and Don

288
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,380
to lose credibility with many of the people and companies that they do business with.

289
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,720
This has resulted in Imigos and Don losing developers, financial support, potential and

290
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,700
existing film clients, and that has further caused them all a great deal of stress.

291
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,420
Alex has recently become very public about the matter.

292
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,140
We have decided to pursue court action solely to educate Imigos' rights and to clear up

293
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,140
any dispute with Alex.

294
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:53,020
This is all in the hopes that the developers, including Don, can continue with their first

295
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,940
left, development of the game.

296
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,900
It is and always has been my understanding that Imigos owns valid copyrights in all their

297
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,980
works from which Alex has issued takedowns.

298
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,460
It is also my understanding and position that Alex has no right to issue takedowns for Imigos'

299
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,580
and related content.

300
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,380
Imigos and Don have engaged me to pursue these legal rights as reasonably and appropriately

301
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,380
as possible.

302
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,920
It is our primary goal to establish Imigos' rights and the community's rights to publish

303
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,700
Star Mazer and Star Mazer DSP content.

304
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,980
Meanwhile, Maura continued her long descent off the deep end.

305
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,380
I just expect former clients to not disclose copies of paper containing my contact info,

306
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,680
redacted social security number, and signature.

307
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,420
For all I know, you creepy fucking scumbags might photoshop my signature from the document

308
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,700
into other things, to sign me up for shit like credit cards or god knows what the fuck.

309
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,700
Go ahead.

310
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,660
I dare you to fucking do that and see how long Don Thacker remains out of jail.

311
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,940
Oh, and if you could all stop threatening my life now that would be good.

312
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,860
For all I know, someone is going to be standing outside of my house waiting for me.

313
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,020
I may as well go buy a gun for protection.

314
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,020
Let's see your doxxing.

315
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,880
Uh, that's 1x love.

316
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,480
Fucking faces, meet me outside of my house with all that shit now.

317
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,120
I guess that's a part of the job description for YouTuber now?

318
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,780
Death threats and meeting people outside their doxxed fucking houses?

319
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,140
There's a lot to reply here, but I'll just say one thing.

320
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,820
There is no job description for YouTuber, it's apparently not a real job.

321
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,700
Sid Alpha, the original YouTuber that actually managed to get a reply from Maura back when

322
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:15,860
this all started, was soon sent another message from her, that simply stated, I want to literally

323
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,860
kill you.

324
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,940
In a short span of time, she went from being apparently fearful of her life from death

325
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,300
threats, to issuing one herself.

326
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,060
Sid Alpha's reply was only, oh, do you?

327
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,300
Maura quickly replied again with, never ask for my comment again.

328
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,060
You are a cyberbully, 100,000%.

329
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,640
And you are transphobic, seriously.

330
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,140
You think your fucking cisgender world is all that exists?

331
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,620
You think I don't own a photograph of myself?

332
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,080
Then you're a fucking robot.

333
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,580
I want to kill myself, but I have to kill you first.

334
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,180
It's here that we've hit the rock bottom of the situation, and also where Maura herself

335
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,540
has hit rock bottom in her personal life.

336
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,820
What comes next is entirely my own speculation, but I think this is what happened.

337
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,020
Alex Maura's mental health has been on a slow decline for a while now.

338
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,320
I think this decline caused her to lose her job with Imogos, which most likely contributed

339
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,220
to Maura's furthering instability due to her close friendship with Don Thacker, the

340
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,300
man who had befriended her nearly a decade ago and brought her on as both a colleague

341
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,300
and pal.

342
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,860
This was likely extremely personal for Maura.

343
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,860
It wasn't about the YouTubers, and it wasn't about Imogos, it was most likely about Don.

344
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,220
It could have been a betrayal of friendship on the job.

345
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,960
It could have been romantic in nature.

346
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,380
It could have been just the slow decline of an individual due to other unrelated mental

347
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,060
problems that was compounded first by the firing, and second by the massive internet

348
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,060
backlash.

349
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,060
Who knows?

350
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,660
I don't think any of us ever will.

351
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,620
But this all smacks of a personal dispute that exploded wildly into the realm of DMCAs

352
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,620
and SJW bullshit.

353
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,060
And yes, I do say SJW bullshit for a reason.

354
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,320
Alex Maurer followed a tried and true formula that Gamergate knows well.

355
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,080
You start with unethical practices.

356
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,900
Add in a spice of accused privilege and power for your opponent.

357
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,660
When things hit the court of public opinion, cry harassment to all your detractors.

358
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,580
When things get worse, claim bigotry by any possible metric you can.

359
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,320
In this case, transphobia.

360
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,940
Overblow any death threats, insults, and harassment you may receive, and begin issuing similar

361
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,180
death threats, insults, and harassment yourself.

362
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,160
There's one big difference, though.

363
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,040
At the end of this formula, all the big SJW names, the Zoe's, the Anita's, they get

364
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,240
money, prestige, and protection.

365
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,040
Instead, Maurer got isolation, legal repercussions, and eventually a complete mental breakdown

366
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,800
causing her to seek the help that she so obviously needs.

367
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,880
Leonard French, Imogosa's lawyer, posted a video on Maurer's final collapse.

368
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:57,760
Eventually became actual threats of imminent bodily injury or harm.

369
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:06,620
At one point, I was threatened with having my windows broken, my building set on fire.

370
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,040
There were some colorful ones in there that I'll leave out because I don't want to encourage

371
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,500
it.

372
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:19,780
There was, of course, this ever-present image of a knife to her neck, and she said that

373
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,860
that wasn't a suicide threat, it was something else.

374
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,100
Literally, she said something else.

375
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,100
Okay.

376
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,100
Whatever that is.

377
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:35,300
I have been searching and investigating and doing a lot, a lot of back behind-the-scenes

378
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:43,460
efforts to try and find Alec's help, and the long and the short of it is that we were able

379
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,240
to get Alec's some help, not me alone.

380
00:20:48,240 --> 00:21:05,500
It was an effort of a lot of people, including people I didn't expect, so thank you for all

381
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:11,800
of you who came together to help an obviously suffering individual in her time of need.

382
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,760
The DMCA claims have been redacted.

383
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,560
Alex is receiving some form of help, which has been kept confidential.

384
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,720
And yes, the legal action is still going forward.

385
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,400
I think it's important to really split this into two discussions here.

386
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,460
Alex Maurer has abused the DMCA, has hurt a lot of people, and must face whatever appropriate

387
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,560
punishment is deemed necessary for that.

388
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,280
Imogosa's rights need to be protected, as do the rights of the continent creators dragged

389
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,520
into this unwillingly.

390
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,200
At the same time, Alex Maurer is clearly suffering.

391
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,200
She did all of this of her own volition, but guys, it's not worth her life or her health.

392
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,680
She's still a person who needs help.

393
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,200
Her actions, and her punishment for those actions, and her issues and the potential

394
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,680
for her recovery are two different things.

395
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,460
I want to make one thing absolutely clear.

396
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,360
It is my opinion that the curious case of Alex Maurer ended on a good note because despite

397
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,120
her self-claimed status as a trans woman in the gaming industry, Alex Maurer had no institutional

398
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,880
support from the usual anti-Gamergate suspects.

399
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
No Journos.

400
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
No Gamergazi.

401
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,880
No feminist frequency.

402
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,880
No crash override.

403
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,200
Nothing from the usual suspects on Twitter or YouTube.

404
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,020
I'm sure she, at one time, positioned herself as the next Zoe Quinn, at least in her head,

405
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,200
but thankfully that didn't manifest in reality.

406
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,960
When the support wasn't there from the SJW clique, the only option left was to seek

407
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,040
professional help.

408
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,720
Which really makes me think, how many others that Gamergate knows so well are in the same

409
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
boat?

410
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,440
What if there's a nugget of goodness in people like Zoe and Anita and Brianna and

411
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,040
so many others, covered up by years of bad habits, of corruption, of self-destructive

412
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,320
tendencies, of social justice inculcation?

413
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,520
SJWs and feminist YouTubers are, slowly but surely, starting to come around, not becoming

414
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,680
anti-SJW or anti-feminist zealots, but at least beginning to use their critical thought

415
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,720
processes more actively, and getting punished by the clique for it.

416
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,000
Laci Green is a great recent example of this.

417
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,480
She's nowhere near to being an anti-feminist as far as I can tell, but just talking to

418
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,360
the antis has caused her own group to excommunicate her.

419
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,000
It's my opinion that the hardcore strands of social justice indoctrinate in the way

420
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,240
that an extremist intolerant religion does, and when the ideology is threatened, the natural

421
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,920
reaction is to go deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole.

422
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,240
I don't know if Alex is actually trans, and that her transness brought her into social

423
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,920
justice, which inevitably led her into the sorry mental state she found herself in, or

424
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,080
if her claims of being trans were a side effect of an already fragile mental state to begin

425
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,080
with.

426
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,080
Here's what I do think, though.

427
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,120
Alex Maurer's claims of transphobia near the endpoint, as a person who already had

428
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,280
emotional or mental issues, showed that those issues were rapidly compounded by exposure

429
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,360
to extremist social justice views.

430
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,260
Like any religion, like any cult, the SJW mindset needs only a small opening to turn

431
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,140
your average person with a bit of depression into an emotional wreck, self-destructing

432
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,360
constantly and taking everything down with them.

433
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,640
I think this is what happened to Alex Maurer.

434
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,900
And I think, if people like Zoe and Anita and Brianna didn't have the massive amount

435
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,440
of wealth, connections, and privilege that they do, it would be happening to them too.

436
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,840
But in the end, it was a good thing that Alex Maurer didn't have them, because her lack

437
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,240
of them is what allowed her to get the help that she needs.

438
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,040
At least, regarding that, I'm very happy for.

439
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:09,440
But please, stop selling Chiptune albums for a thousand bucks, Alex.

440
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,440
Thanks for watching, guys.

441
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,920
This is the second Indefensible in a week, and I'm happy to say that I'm back to

442
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,180
doing this stuff full-time.

443
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:18,020
It won't always be Indefensibles, it might be political stuff in the style of my Trouble

444
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,680
with Trudeau video, but I plan to keep this channel updated regularly from now on.

445
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,120
Thanks to all of you supporters on the SFO Patreon who motivate me to keep doing this

446
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,040
stuff, even when I thought that I couldn't do it myself and had nothing of value to contribute

447
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
to the community.

448
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,880
And, just as a treat, this video should be releasing on the morning of July 1st, 2017,

449
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,280
the 150th anniversary of Canada's founding.

450
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,680
To celebrate both Canada Day and Alex Maurer's hopefully impending recovery, my friends and

451
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,320
I are going to be streaming Death Road to Canada over at twitch.tv slash sharpadotaku,

452
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,120
one of Alex Maurer's games.

453
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,420
Please don't DM CAS.

454
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,080
The stream should be going right when this video goes live, so come say hi, I'd love

455
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
to chat with you.

456
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,280
Alright guys, I love you.

457
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,760
See you next time.
