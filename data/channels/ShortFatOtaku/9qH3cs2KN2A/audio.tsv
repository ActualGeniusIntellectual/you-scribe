0	18380	So, while everyone's attention was turned towards VidCon this past weekend, and the
18380	22880	absolute shitshow that erupted there, something else was happening at about the same time.
22880	26080	Something that I personally believe to be equally as important to the conversation of
26080	31360	free speech, fair use, and ethical conduct as Sargon getting called a garbage human for
31360	35240	simply sitting quietly at Anita Sarkeesian's panel and listening to her talk.
35240	39520	This is actually the sort of thing I expected all of the usual skeptical suspects to cover,
39520	42840	and to my surprise, I don't think anyone's talked about it yet.
42840	45620	I'm not blaming them, of course, they were busy.
45620	48760	But this is pretty important, so I guess it's left up to me.
48760	51260	Let's discuss the curious case of Alex Maurer.
51260	56220	Star Maser DSP is an arcade-style spacecraft shoot-'em-up that recalls the glory days
56220	59940	of games like Gradius, Phalanx, and Zero Wing.
59940	64900	Being a 2016 indie game, it's got that hyper-smooth pixel style that seems to be trending right
64900	65900	now.
65900	70140	It raised $200,000 on Kickstarter, and was first pushed to the forefront of people's
70140	73940	attention when the early access demo hit Steam in August of 2016.
73940	78100	I haven't played it myself, and I'm not a super-huge fan of the genre, but from the
78100	82140	gameplay videos I can find, it looks to be a polished, lovingly-made, serviceable entry
82140	83380	into the shmup genre.
83380	86580	Maybe a bit repetitive, but that's more of a failing of the genre rather than Star
86580	87940	Maser DSP itself.
87940	91300	For a while, all was well and good with Star Maser DSP.
91300	94440	And then suddenly, people from all across the internet began getting hit with copyright
94440	96500	strikes for their reviews and let's plays of the game.
96500	101340	And not from Imago Softworks, the indie dev that created Star Maser DSP, but rather Alex
101340	104380	Maurer, the composer of the game's music and sound effects.
104380	108580	Alex Maurer, before this incident, had made a name for herself as a composer.
108580	113980	She'd worked on games like Death Road to Canada, Spy Hunter, Need for Speed, Serious Sam, and
113980	116900	Penny Arcade's On the Rain Slick Precipice of Darkness.
116900	119500	She'd also worked on multiple short films as well.
119500	123260	And according to her Wikipedia page, she'd actually released an album designed to be
123260	126340	played on NES, using an NES cartridge.
126340	127340	Cool.
127340	130920	Maurer was contracted to do the soundtrack for Star Maser, in which she was paid monthly
130920	132300	until the work was completed.
132300	136140	However, due to reasons that have understandably been kept private, Maurer was released from
136140	139180	her contract with Imago Softworks before the work was complete.
139180	143180	Due to non-disclosure agreements and the general state of the game's industry, I don't think
143180	145860	we'll ever find out exactly why Maurer was let go.
145860	149480	But I think we can extrapolate from what I'm about to show you in this video a pretty accurate
149480	150940	picture of the situation.
150940	154560	Maurer claims that the contract she signed was legally binding to a game called Star
154560	160260	Maser, not Star Maser DSP, and that because she was let go before she completed the work,
160260	165300	all of the music and sound effects in Star Maser DSP are her own intellectual property,
165300	169300	and that it is her right to levy a copyright strike against any YouTuber or streamer that
169300	171620	plays Star Maser DSP on their shows.
171620	175740	However, if we take a peek at Maurer's contract, which has actually made the rounds on the
175740	180300	internet, we can see that the contract specifically states that her position is work-for-hire,
180300	184060	meaning that any content she creates under this contract is explicitly owned by Imago
184060	186180	Softworks, not Maurer personally.
186180	189820	Furthermore, Imago Softworks' position on this contract is that it covers both Star
189820	193780	Maser and all related Star Maser products, like Star Maser DSP.
193780	198180	Maurer's counter position is that, because she was released from the contract early,
198180	202700	without completion of said contract, that those stipulations are null and void, that
202700	204220	the music is owned by her.
204220	208080	And using that line of reasoning, Maurer began issuing copyright strikes to YouTubers and
208080	211240	streamers playing Star Maser DSP on their channels and shows.
211240	214780	Her logic was that because the music in the game was her intellectual property, and that
214780	218540	because the content creators in question failed to obtain permission from her personally,
218540	222420	her only legal recourse of action to protect her intellectual property was to use the Digital
222420	225260	Millennium Copyright Act, or the DMCA.
225260	229620	Maurer began to file false DMCA claims to what would ultimately be over 100 YouTube
229620	235340	channels and just as many, if not more, Twitch streams using each service's auto-claim process.
235340	238640	And we all know how unforgiving this shit can be at times.
238640	243660	Content ID is bad enough, where Scattershot matches auto-claim videos, even when the holder
243660	246100	of the copyright doesn't want them to be claimed.
246100	250620	But on both of these platforms, somebody like Maurer can show up, file a claim, and it just
250620	251740	goes through.
251740	255300	Nobody at Twitch or YouTube actually looks at the claim, it's all automated, it just
255300	259080	goes through without a hitch, and it's on the channels involved to actually appeal them.
259080	262860	And these strikes are no laughing matter for anybody who seriously values their channel.
262860	266960	They constitute legal action that the platform must act upon in one way or another, and many
266960	272700	channels have vanished, never to return, due to both valid and invalid DMCA notices.
272740	277660	Many of the larger names that we all know and love, including Nintendo, Sega, Sony,
277660	281500	Konami, and so on, have automated strikes issued in their name.
281500	286100	I think every YouTuber, both large and small, has a story that they can tell about the DMCA,
286100	289620	but I'll just stick to my own personal one, just to give you a sense of scale.
289620	294460	Check this out, my gaming channel gets almost no traffic, I've got about 20 Twitch stream
294460	299060	regulars, whom I all appreciate very much, and just as many views per Let's Play episode
299060	300460	on YouTube on average.
300460	304540	Do you really think that somebody over at Nintendo of Japan is issuing Japanese language
304540	308340	copyright strikes on my 10 view Breath of the Wild Let's Play parts?
308340	311900	If so, I would absolutely hate to be the dude doing that job, but I'm pretty sure this
311900	316460	is all automated, with computers mass blanketing strikes wherever matches take them.
316460	320500	Over the course of the past week, as all of this was unfolding, I actually emailed Mauer
320500	324440	myself, to ask her exactly what was going on, but she didn't reply to me, probably
324440	326140	because I'm a 500 sub pleb.
326140	329580	However, a larger YouTuber by the name of Sid Alpha, who had also been watching the
329580	332700	drama unfold, did in fact get a reply from her.
332700	333700	Let's read it.
333700	338260	The fact that Temi Noko, one of the YouTubers hit by Mauer's DMCA clams, is directing
338260	341100	her complaints to me instead of the developer is a problem.
341100	345300	This seems to be a general response of those who were hit with DMCA strikes.
345300	349260	I did suggest to some who complained to me that I would reverse their DMCA strikes if
349260	351540	they were willing to redirect their complaints to the developer.
351540	355260	No one was willing to do so, and I no longer want to offer anyone the possibility of having
355260	357540	their DMCA strikes reversed.
357540	358540	Wow.
358540	360260	So this is what this sounds like to me.
360260	363580	Mauer, it sounds like you're pissed from being let go from Imajos Softworks.
363580	366640	It sounds like you believe you should still have that job and be paid the remaining money
366640	367860	from finishing the contract out.
367860	371740	And it sounds like, rather than keep your dispute between you and Imajos, you would
371740	375000	rather press-gang YouTubers into fighting for you in the court of public opinion, by
375000	379100	filing DMCA notifications against their videos, and then telling them to redirect their complaints
379100	380100	to Imajos.
380100	382180	Except Imajos didn't file the notification.
382180	383180	You did.
383180	384440	That's your name there on the strike.
384440	385440	Nobody else's.
385440	388140	Let's be charitable towards your interpretation of events, Alex.
388140	391820	Let's assume that Imajos Softworks let you go for a completely bullshit reason.
391820	395340	Let's assume that you're entirely innocent, and that you should have been able to complete
395340	396820	your work and get paid as promised.
396820	400420	Let's even assume that Imajos Softworks' actions towards you were illegal.
400420	403820	Why do you think that gives you the right to start issuing notifications against uninvolved
403820	405280	third parties?
405280	406940	What did you expect would happen here?
406940	410420	Did you expect streamers and let's players to just give in and go fight Imajos on your
410420	411420	behalf?
411420	413940	Did you want to frame this as a David and Goliath situation?
413940	416980	A poor video games composer versus the big bad company?
416980	419380	Forming her out into the street with little recourse?
419380	423620	Or maybe, did you want this to become a grassroots thing where mobs of people show up at Imagoza's
423620	425220	digital doorstep to fight for your cause?
425220	428300	Well, there's no fucking chance of that happening now, and then after you've threatened
428300	430360	their channels with copyright strikes.
430360	433460	Channels which, for some of these people, are their livelihoods.
433460	435020	You know what might have worked?
435020	436380	Alerting the games press.
436380	440020	Yeah, Kotaku and Polygon and the others are absolute shit-suckers.
440020	442880	But you're an indie woman apparently getting trampled by a company.
442880	444060	They'd lap that shit up.
444060	445500	They'd signal boost it among their crowd.
445500	447820	And you may have actually ended up with some support.
447820	453340	Or maybe contacting the YouTubers and streamers playing Star Mazer DSP without a DMCA claim
453340	456780	and informing them of the situation and asking them to help raise awareness.
456780	459860	Even a GoFundMe for your legal action would have probably worked.
459860	463620	All of these options were available to you, but you chose to pursue legal action against
463620	464620	uninvolved individuals.
464620	468540	I'd ask you why, but I think I have a pretty reasonable assumption here.
468540	471980	You don't really have a leg to stand on regarding your claims, and you know it.
471980	475480	There are legal consequences to filing a false DMCA claim.
475480	480220	Mauer lives in the USA, as do many of the people she's filed against, making the legalities
480220	482140	of the situation a bit more straightforward.
482140	486060	And I doubt she has the army of lawyers that a major game dev would use to stall countersuits
486060	487520	until they fizzle out.
487520	492820	If the use of content is covered by fair use laws, a DMCA claim is considered to be false.
492820	497660	And even if the use of content is not covered by fair use laws, a contract that Mauer signed
497660	499900	states that she does not actually own the content.
499900	503900	And a DMCA claim filed for content one doesn't own is also considered to be false.
503900	506620	Abuse of the DMCA does have legal consequences.
506620	510560	If Mauer's interpretation of the contract is upheld over the course of any legal battle
510560	514540	she undertakes with Imago Softworks, many of these strikes and claims will also be upheld
514540	515580	as legitimate.
515580	519860	But if Mauer's interpretation is not upheld, she has opened the door wide for many content
519860	524260	creators to set precedents regarding copyright law as it pertains to streams and let's plays,
524260	527480	as well as absolutely destroying herself financially and legally.
527480	530800	Either way, I think she's already destroyed herself professionally.
530800	535240	Despite her impressive body of work, I don't think anybody would ever dare hire her again.
535240	539600	However, as the week went on, rather than back down, apologize, delete Facebook, lawyer
539600	543360	up and hit the gym, Mauer decided instead to double down.
543360	547800	She began filing DMCAs against people who had done videos on Duck Game and Death Road
547800	552560	to Canada, games unrelated to the Imago debacle but ones that she did work on, as well as
552560	556840	sending a cease and desist to Turner Broadcasting due to their own involvement in Duck Game.
556840	557840	Holy shit.
557840	559280	Let's see what she actually has to say about it.
559280	562880	I don't have to give anyone permission to have my music be in their videos.
562880	567280	I told people to contact Imagos because Imagos is responsible for releasing a game that violated
567280	568280	copyright.
568280	572560	Also, I don't think that video recording yourself playing video games is a realistic job.
572560	575880	Creating video games is, and it is a very risky business to be in.
575880	579680	This is a continuation of her previous stance regarding her owning the rights to Starmazer
579680	581720	DSP's soundtrack, not Imagos.
581720	585800	But it's also a rebuke that many content creators face by a lot of less than charitable individuals.
585800	587640	That it's not a real job.
587640	589240	A job is what pays the bills.
589240	590240	Period.
590240	593420	Alex, did you know that at one time, being involved in television wasn't considered
593420	594420	a job?
594420	596440	Or being involved in radio?
596440	600360	Did you know that at one time, people stood around in a field to watch very basic airplanes
600360	605280	fly about 40 or 50 feet, say to themselves, golly gee, isn't that something, but never
605280	609660	once considered that a multi-billion dollar industry would spring up from that innovation?
609660	612920	Every single time there's a new invention or new medium, there will be people who may
612920	618240	think that it's a novelty, but does not actually consist of any real work beyond hobbyism.
618240	623240	Let me repeat, Alex, streaming and let's playing is not a real job to you.
623240	626960	Likely because you're 34 years old, and grew up in an environment where such a thing
626960	627960	was unthinkable.
627960	630120	Thankfully for the rest of us, we've moved beyond that.
630120	634040	And as a quick aside, TotalBiscuit got involved in all this bullshit too, quipping that, for
634040	637680	this not being a real job, it sure as hell can afford the lawyers that Alex's real
637680	639000	job seemingly can't.
639000	640000	I love you bro.
640000	644120	TB decided to reach out to YouTube Gaming and Twitch using the clout of his own channel,
644120	647720	in order to help expedite some of the counterclaims filed by smaller channels against Maurer's
647720	648720	bullshit.
648720	652400	Additionally, a GoFundMe was set up to help pay for legal expenses against Maurer, which
652400	655640	hit $10,000 in under 24 hours.
655640	658560	It's still going by the way, so please go donate if you can.
658560	663120	At the time of recording this video, they need another 2,000 American, and I have confidence
663120	664680	that we can scrape it together.
664680	668640	Additionally, even though it's been a very long time since August 2014, the internet
668640	673440	still has no tolerance for unethical practices, and I'm personally absolutely proud of you
673440	674440	guys for that.
674440	678880	Here's Maurer addressing TemiNeko, the content creator she mentioned earlier as being one
678880	680800	of the ones she refused to back down on.
680800	683640	Thanks for helping me get death threats for doing nothing wrong.
683640	686200	These death threats are coming from people who have my address.
686200	690200	They are literally ruining my livelihood, as in whether or not I'm alive.
690200	691200	Happy?
691200	695360	Now of course, I don't think anybody should be sending actual fucking threats to anybody.
695360	699040	And man, if you're doing this sort of thing for the lulz or whatever, please stop.
699040	703040	But doesn't this whole thing sound familiar to any of you who went through gamergate?
703040	707160	Didn't Brianna Wu, Nita Sarkeesian, Zoe Quinn, and many others start complaining about this
707160	711400	type of shit as soon as they started getting seriously criticized for their unethical practices?
711400	714900	Maybe the call of victim bucks was just too seducing for Maurer to ignore.
714900	718040	But unlike the aforementioned fraudsters, there's probably not going to be much money
718040	719320	for Maurer in all of it.
719320	722980	She's destroyed absolutely everything around her to the point that even the SJW Gaming
722980	725040	cabal seems to be reluctant to get involved.
725040	729200	Over time, Maurer's comments on the topic began to become more and more deranged.
729200	732720	Fucking playing video games is not a job!
732720	736560	If there was a way to DMCA punch you in the face through my computer screen, I would.
736560	739520	You and your fucking friends do not have the right to post videos with my music.
739520	743680	The DMCA system exists so I can say no when the creepy fucking people like you are trying
743680	745120	to fuck my music.
745120	746120	Fuck you.
746120	749280	This sounds like a 50-50 mix of a grumpy old father who doesn't approve of his kid's
749280	753480	career choice and a whining child who's throwing a tantrum when things don't go her way.
753480	757400	Another YouTuber by the name of Musical Anti-Hero managed to get a hold of Alex Maurer and conduct
757400	760560	an interview regarding this whole Star Mazer DSP debacle.
760560	762680	There was honestly nothing too special about it.
762680	765400	Musical Anti-Hero brought up the same points that many others brought up regarding the
765400	769080	use of DMCA, YouTubing being a legitimate source of income, and so on.
769080	770720	Maurer, of course, restated her positions.
770720	774800	But the video Musical Anti-Hero did on the interview was, you guessed it, hit with a
774800	776680	copyright claim by Alex Maurer.
776680	781140	The video itself had none of Maurer's content, and none of Imajos' content in it.
781140	783400	It was entirely Musical Anti-Hero's content.
783400	785480	What was Maurer's twisted reasoning this time?
785480	789000	He used an old photograph from before my gender transition in his video.
789000	791520	It's an extremely sensitive issue for trans people.
791520	793840	I asked him to take it down and he said he would.
793840	796920	Over 12 hours later it was still up, so I decided to report it.
796920	799880	The photo came from my camera and I technically owned the copyright.
799880	801320	Are you fucking kidding me?
801320	803800	I don't care that Alex Maurer turned out to be trans.
803800	807240	She apparently goes by Niki Maurer sometimes, but still seems to use Alex.
807240	810200	It's a gender neutral name anyway, and it's ultimately a non-issue.
810200	814000	And I understand why it may be sensitive to have pre-transition photos thrown about
814000	817640	when you're trans, even though Maurer uploaded said photo herself.
817640	821540	And I'm not even interested in arguing her trans status, even though transtrenders are
821540	825880	absolutely a thing, gender questioning and confused individuals are absolutely a thing,
825880	830400	and just blatantly faking trans status for SJW support is absolutely a thing.
830400	833880	But an individual's face is not automatically protected by copyright.
833880	837820	That is not a right that you intrinsically have simply for owning your own face.
837820	842100	And showing a pre-transition photo is clearly not justification for abuse of the DMCA.
842100	845940	It's about at this point in the story that Imogos just got fucking fed up with the whole
845940	846940	thing.
846940	850300	Imogos began to move forward with legal action against Maurer, stating in a Twitter PM that
850300	854360	"...we have become represented by Leonard French in this case and we intend to litigate.
854360	858100	We are seeking absolutely no damages in this action, only a court-ordered establishment
858100	862200	of our queer defined rights chain and subsequently the place in that chain for YouTubers who
862200	863200	have been affected."
863200	866940	Leonard French, the attorney hired by Imogos, as well as the one behind the GoFundMe intended
866940	870940	to help protect content creators affected by Maurer, released this statement on behalf
870940	872420	of Don Thacker of Imogos.
872420	875400	"...it is with a heavy heart that I announce that we have a plan to help the community
875400	878580	and Imogos through the legal gauntlet that Alex Maurer has set for us.
878580	881980	We feel it is our duty and responsibility to do what we can to mitigate the damage Alex
881980	882980	has caused."
882980	886560	Don's journey with Alex began seven years ago when he met her at PAX East after asking
886560	887900	her to work on one of his films.
887900	889600	They quickly became friends.
889600	892900	Her talent and skill as a musician and artist was readily apparent.
892900	895740	Don and Alex worked on several titles together over the years.
895740	900300	In 2015, Don saw the opportunity to create Starmazer, a dream he had since he was nine
900300	901300	years old.
901300	904500	Don asked Alex to create the music and sound effects assets for the game.
904500	908020	The Kickstarter, the development, the team, it was all a dream come true.
908020	910340	But then Alex's behavior began to change.
910340	913780	Slowly at first, it had become what you have seen publicly recently.
913780	917660	Don tried to keep the matter as quiet as possible out of respect for Alex and in the hope that
917660	922380	the situation would be resolved peacefully, amicably, and to the benefit of everyone.
922380	925860	Unfortunately, the copyright system in the United States has allowed her to assert rights
925860	930080	that she does not actually own, and her assertion of those rights has caused Imigos and Don
930080	933380	to lose credibility with many of the people and companies that they do business with.
933380	937720	This has resulted in Imigos and Don losing developers, financial support, potential and
937720	941700	existing film clients, and that has further caused them all a great deal of stress.
941700	944420	Alex has recently become very public about the matter.
944420	948140	We have decided to pursue court action solely to educate Imigos' rights and to clear up
948140	949140	any dispute with Alex.
949140	953020	This is all in the hopes that the developers, including Don, can continue with their first
953020	954940	left, development of the game.
954940	958900	It is and always has been my understanding that Imigos owns valid copyrights in all their
958900	960980	works from which Alex has issued takedowns.
960980	965460	It is also my understanding and position that Alex has no right to issue takedowns for Imigos'
965460	966580	and related content.
966580	970380	Imigos and Don have engaged me to pursue these legal rights as reasonably and appropriately
970380	971380	as possible.
971380	974920	It is our primary goal to establish Imigos' rights and the community's rights to publish
974920	977700	Star Mazer and Star Mazer DSP content.
977700	980980	Meanwhile, Maura continued her long descent off the deep end.
980980	985380	I just expect former clients to not disclose copies of paper containing my contact info,
985380	987680	redacted social security number, and signature.
987680	991420	For all I know, you creepy fucking scumbags might photoshop my signature from the document
991420	995700	into other things, to sign me up for shit like credit cards or god knows what the fuck.
995700	996700	Go ahead.
996700	1000660	I dare you to fucking do that and see how long Don Thacker remains out of jail.
1000660	1003940	Oh, and if you could all stop threatening my life now that would be good.
1003940	1006860	For all I know, someone is going to be standing outside of my house waiting for me.
1006900	1009020	I may as well go buy a gun for protection.
1009020	1010020	Let's see your doxxing.
1010020	1011880	Uh, that's 1x love.
1011880	1014480	Fucking faces, meet me outside of my house with all that shit now.
1014480	1017120	I guess that's a part of the job description for YouTuber now?
1017120	1019780	Death threats and meeting people outside their doxxed fucking houses?
1019780	1023140	There's a lot to reply here, but I'll just say one thing.
1023140	1026820	There is no job description for YouTuber, it's apparently not a real job.
1026820	1030700	Sid Alpha, the original YouTuber that actually managed to get a reply from Maura back when
1030700	1035860	this all started, was soon sent another message from her, that simply stated, I want to literally
1035860	1036860	kill you.
1036860	1040940	In a short span of time, she went from being apparently fearful of her life from death
1040940	1043300	threats, to issuing one herself.
1043300	1046060	Sid Alpha's reply was only, oh, do you?
1046060	1049300	Maura quickly replied again with, never ask for my comment again.
1049300	1052060	You are a cyberbully, 100,000%.
1052060	1054640	And you are transphobic, seriously.
1054640	1057140	You think your fucking cisgender world is all that exists?
1057140	1058620	You think I don't own a photograph of myself?
1058620	1060080	Then you're a fucking robot.
1060080	1062580	I want to kill myself, but I have to kill you first.
1062580	1066180	It's here that we've hit the rock bottom of the situation, and also where Maura herself
1066180	1068540	has hit rock bottom in her personal life.
1068540	1072820	What comes next is entirely my own speculation, but I think this is what happened.
1072820	1076020	Alex Maura's mental health has been on a slow decline for a while now.
1076020	1080320	I think this decline caused her to lose her job with Imogos, which most likely contributed
1080320	1084220	to Maura's furthering instability due to her close friendship with Don Thacker, the
1084220	1087300	man who had befriended her nearly a decade ago and brought her on as both a colleague
1087300	1088300	and pal.
1088300	1090860	This was likely extremely personal for Maura.
1090860	1094860	It wasn't about the YouTubers, and it wasn't about Imogos, it was most likely about Don.
1094860	1097220	It could have been a betrayal of friendship on the job.
1097220	1098960	It could have been romantic in nature.
1098960	1102380	It could have been just the slow decline of an individual due to other unrelated mental
1102380	1106060	problems that was compounded first by the firing, and second by the massive internet
1106060	1107060	backlash.
1107060	1108060	Who knows?
1108060	1109660	I don't think any of us ever will.
1109660	1113620	But this all smacks of a personal dispute that exploded wildly into the realm of DMCAs
1113620	1114620	and SJW bullshit.
1114620	1118060	And yes, I do say SJW bullshit for a reason.
1118060	1121320	Alex Maurer followed a tried and true formula that Gamergate knows well.
1121320	1123080	You start with unethical practices.
1123080	1125900	Add in a spice of accused privilege and power for your opponent.
1125900	1129660	When things hit the court of public opinion, cry harassment to all your detractors.
1129660	1133580	When things get worse, claim bigotry by any possible metric you can.
1133580	1135320	In this case, transphobia.
1135320	1139940	Overblow any death threats, insults, and harassment you may receive, and begin issuing similar
1139940	1142180	death threats, insults, and harassment yourself.
1142180	1144160	There's one big difference, though.
1144160	1149040	At the end of this formula, all the big SJW names, the Zoe's, the Anita's, they get
1149040	1151240	money, prestige, and protection.
1151240	1156040	Instead, Maurer got isolation, legal repercussions, and eventually a complete mental breakdown
1156040	1158800	causing her to seek the help that she so obviously needs.
1158800	1162880	Leonard French, Imogosa's lawyer, posted a video on Maurer's final collapse.
1188800	1197760	Eventually became actual threats of imminent bodily injury or harm.
1197760	1206620	At one point, I was threatened with having my windows broken, my building set on fire.
1206620	1210040	There were some colorful ones in there that I'll leave out because I don't want to encourage
1210040	1213500	it.
1213500	1219780	There was, of course, this ever-present image of a knife to her neck, and she said that
1219780	1222860	that wasn't a suicide threat, it was something else.
1222860	1225100	Literally, she said something else.
1225100	1226100	Okay.
1226100	1227100	Whatever that is.
1227100	1235300	I have been searching and investigating and doing a lot, a lot of back behind-the-scenes
1235300	1243460	efforts to try and find Alec's help, and the long and the short of it is that we were able
1243460	1248240	to get Alec's some help, not me alone.
1248240	1265500	It was an effort of a lot of people, including people I didn't expect, so thank you for all
1265500	1271800	of you who came together to help an obviously suffering individual in her time of need.
1271800	1273760	The DMCA claims have been redacted.
1273760	1277560	Alex is receiving some form of help, which has been kept confidential.
1277560	1279720	And yes, the legal action is still going forward.
1279720	1282400	I think it's important to really split this into two discussions here.
1282400	1287460	Alex Maurer has abused the DMCA, has hurt a lot of people, and must face whatever appropriate
1287460	1289560	punishment is deemed necessary for that.
1289560	1293280	Imogosa's rights need to be protected, as do the rights of the continent creators dragged
1293280	1294520	into this unwillingly.
1294520	1297200	At the same time, Alex Maurer is clearly suffering.
1297200	1301200	She did all of this of her own volition, but guys, it's not worth her life or her health.
1301200	1302680	She's still a person who needs help.
1302680	1306200	Her actions, and her punishment for those actions, and her issues and the potential
1306200	1308680	for her recovery are two different things.
1308680	1310460	I want to make one thing absolutely clear.
1310460	1314360	It is my opinion that the curious case of Alex Maurer ended on a good note because despite
1314360	1319120	her self-claimed status as a trans woman in the gaming industry, Alex Maurer had no institutional
1319120	1321880	support from the usual anti-Gamergate suspects.
1321880	1322880	No Journos.
1322880	1323880	No Gamergazi.
1323880	1324880	No feminist frequency.
1324880	1325880	No crash override.
1325880	1328200	Nothing from the usual suspects on Twitter or YouTube.
1328200	1333020	I'm sure she, at one time, positioned herself as the next Zoe Quinn, at least in her head,
1333020	1335200	but thankfully that didn't manifest in reality.
1335200	1338960	When the support wasn't there from the SJW clique, the only option left was to seek
1338960	1340040	professional help.
1340040	1343720	Which really makes me think, how many others that Gamergate knows so well are in the same
1343720	1344720	boat?
1344720	1347440	What if there's a nugget of goodness in people like Zoe and Anita and Brianna and
1347440	1352040	so many others, covered up by years of bad habits, of corruption, of self-destructive
1352040	1354320	tendencies, of social justice inculcation?
1354440	1359520	SJWs and feminist YouTubers are, slowly but surely, starting to come around, not becoming
1359520	1363680	anti-SJW or anti-feminist zealots, but at least beginning to use their critical thought
1363680	1366720	processes more actively, and getting punished by the clique for it.
1366720	1369000	Laci Green is a great recent example of this.
1369000	1372480	She's nowhere near to being an anti-feminist as far as I can tell, but just talking to
1372480	1375360	the antis has caused her own group to excommunicate her.
1375360	1379000	It's my opinion that the hardcore strands of social justice indoctrinate in the way
1379000	1383240	that an extremist intolerant religion does, and when the ideology is threatened, the natural
1383240	1385920	reaction is to go deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole.
1385920	1390240	I don't know if Alex is actually trans, and that her transness brought her into social
1390240	1395920	justice, which inevitably led her into the sorry mental state she found herself in, or
1395920	1400080	if her claims of being trans were a side effect of an already fragile mental state to begin
1400080	1401080	with.
1401080	1402080	Here's what I do think, though.
1402080	1406120	Alex Maurer's claims of transphobia near the endpoint, as a person who already had
1406120	1410280	emotional or mental issues, showed that those issues were rapidly compounded by exposure
1410280	1412360	to extremist social justice views.
1412360	1417260	Like any religion, like any cult, the SJW mindset needs only a small opening to turn
1417260	1421140	your average person with a bit of depression into an emotional wreck, self-destructing
1421140	1423360	constantly and taking everything down with them.
1423360	1425640	I think this is what happened to Alex Maurer.
1425640	1429900	And I think, if people like Zoe and Anita and Brianna didn't have the massive amount
1429900	1434440	of wealth, connections, and privilege that they do, it would be happening to them too.
1434440	1437840	But in the end, it was a good thing that Alex Maurer didn't have them, because her lack
1437840	1440240	of them is what allowed her to get the help that she needs.
1440240	1443040	At least, regarding that, I'm very happy for.
1443040	1449440	But please, stop selling Chiptune albums for a thousand bucks, Alex.
1449440	1450440	Thanks for watching, guys.
1450440	1452920	This is the second Indefensible in a week, and I'm happy to say that I'm back to
1452920	1454180	doing this stuff full-time.
1454180	1458020	It won't always be Indefensibles, it might be political stuff in the style of my Trouble
1458020	1461680	with Trudeau video, but I plan to keep this channel updated regularly from now on.
1461680	1465120	Thanks to all of you supporters on the SFO Patreon who motivate me to keep doing this
1465120	1469040	stuff, even when I thought that I couldn't do it myself and had nothing of value to contribute
1469040	1470040	to the community.
1470040	1474880	And, just as a treat, this video should be releasing on the morning of July 1st, 2017,
1474880	1477280	the 150th anniversary of Canada's founding.
1477280	1481680	To celebrate both Canada Day and Alex Maurer's hopefully impending recovery, my friends and
1481680	1486320	I are going to be streaming Death Road to Canada over at twitch.tv slash sharpadotaku,
1486320	1488120	one of Alex Maurer's games.
1488120	1489420	Please don't DM CAS.
1489420	1493080	The stream should be going right when this video goes live, so come say hi, I'd love
1493080	1494080	to chat with you.
1494080	1495280	Alright guys, I love you.
1495280	1495760	See you next time.
