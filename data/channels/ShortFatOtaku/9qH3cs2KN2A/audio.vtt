00:00.000 --> 00:18.380
So, while everyone's attention was turned towards VidCon this past weekend, and the

00:18.380 --> 00:22.880
absolute shitshow that erupted there, something else was happening at about the same time.

00:22.880 --> 00:26.080
Something that I personally believe to be equally as important to the conversation of

00:26.080 --> 00:31.360
free speech, fair use, and ethical conduct as Sargon getting called a garbage human for

00:31.360 --> 00:35.240
simply sitting quietly at Anita Sarkeesian's panel and listening to her talk.

00:35.240 --> 00:39.520
This is actually the sort of thing I expected all of the usual skeptical suspects to cover,

00:39.520 --> 00:42.840
and to my surprise, I don't think anyone's talked about it yet.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.620
I'm not blaming them, of course, they were busy.

00:45.620 --> 00:48.760
But this is pretty important, so I guess it's left up to me.

00:48.760 --> 00:51.260
Let's discuss the curious case of Alex Maurer.

00:51.260 --> 00:56.220
Star Maser DSP is an arcade-style spacecraft shoot-'em-up that recalls the glory days

00:56.220 --> 00:59.940
of games like Gradius, Phalanx, and Zero Wing.

00:59.940 --> 01:04.900
Being a 2016 indie game, it's got that hyper-smooth pixel style that seems to be trending right

01:04.900 --> 01:05.900
now.

01:05.900 --> 01:10.140
It raised $200,000 on Kickstarter, and was first pushed to the forefront of people's

01:10.140 --> 01:13.940
attention when the early access demo hit Steam in August of 2016.

01:13.940 --> 01:18.100
I haven't played it myself, and I'm not a super-huge fan of the genre, but from the

01:18.100 --> 01:22.140
gameplay videos I can find, it looks to be a polished, lovingly-made, serviceable entry

01:22.140 --> 01:23.380
into the shmup genre.

01:23.380 --> 01:26.580
Maybe a bit repetitive, but that's more of a failing of the genre rather than Star

01:26.580 --> 01:27.940
Maser DSP itself.

01:27.940 --> 01:31.300
For a while, all was well and good with Star Maser DSP.

01:31.300 --> 01:34.440
And then suddenly, people from all across the internet began getting hit with copyright

01:34.440 --> 01:36.500
strikes for their reviews and let's plays of the game.

01:36.500 --> 01:41.340
And not from Imago Softworks, the indie dev that created Star Maser DSP, but rather Alex

01:41.340 --> 01:44.380
Maurer, the composer of the game's music and sound effects.

01:44.380 --> 01:48.580
Alex Maurer, before this incident, had made a name for herself as a composer.

01:48.580 --> 01:53.980
She'd worked on games like Death Road to Canada, Spy Hunter, Need for Speed, Serious Sam, and

01:53.980 --> 01:56.900
Penny Arcade's On the Rain Slick Precipice of Darkness.

01:56.900 --> 01:59.500
She'd also worked on multiple short films as well.

01:59.500 --> 02:03.260
And according to her Wikipedia page, she'd actually released an album designed to be

02:03.260 --> 02:06.340
played on NES, using an NES cartridge.

02:06.340 --> 02:07.340
Cool.

02:07.340 --> 02:10.920
Maurer was contracted to do the soundtrack for Star Maser, in which she was paid monthly

02:10.920 --> 02:12.300
until the work was completed.

02:12.300 --> 02:16.140
However, due to reasons that have understandably been kept private, Maurer was released from

02:16.140 --> 02:19.180
her contract with Imago Softworks before the work was complete.

02:19.180 --> 02:23.180
Due to non-disclosure agreements and the general state of the game's industry, I don't think

02:23.180 --> 02:25.860
we'll ever find out exactly why Maurer was let go.

02:25.860 --> 02:29.480
But I think we can extrapolate from what I'm about to show you in this video a pretty accurate

02:29.480 --> 02:30.940
picture of the situation.

02:30.940 --> 02:34.560
Maurer claims that the contract she signed was legally binding to a game called Star

02:34.560 --> 02:40.260
Maser, not Star Maser DSP, and that because she was let go before she completed the work,

02:40.260 --> 02:45.300
all of the music and sound effects in Star Maser DSP are her own intellectual property,

02:45.300 --> 02:49.300
and that it is her right to levy a copyright strike against any YouTuber or streamer that

02:49.300 --> 02:51.620
plays Star Maser DSP on their shows.

02:51.620 --> 02:55.740
However, if we take a peek at Maurer's contract, which has actually made the rounds on the

02:55.740 --> 03:00.300
internet, we can see that the contract specifically states that her position is work-for-hire,

03:00.300 --> 03:04.060
meaning that any content she creates under this contract is explicitly owned by Imago

03:04.060 --> 03:06.180
Softworks, not Maurer personally.

03:06.180 --> 03:09.820
Furthermore, Imago Softworks' position on this contract is that it covers both Star

03:09.820 --> 03:13.780
Maser and all related Star Maser products, like Star Maser DSP.

03:13.780 --> 03:18.180
Maurer's counter position is that, because she was released from the contract early,

03:18.180 --> 03:22.700
without completion of said contract, that those stipulations are null and void, that

03:22.700 --> 03:24.220
the music is owned by her.

03:24.220 --> 03:28.080
And using that line of reasoning, Maurer began issuing copyright strikes to YouTubers and

03:28.080 --> 03:31.240
streamers playing Star Maser DSP on their channels and shows.

03:31.240 --> 03:34.780
Her logic was that because the music in the game was her intellectual property, and that

03:34.780 --> 03:38.540
because the content creators in question failed to obtain permission from her personally,

03:38.540 --> 03:42.420
her only legal recourse of action to protect her intellectual property was to use the Digital

03:42.420 --> 03:45.260
Millennium Copyright Act, or the DMCA.

03:45.260 --> 03:49.620
Maurer began to file false DMCA claims to what would ultimately be over 100 YouTube

03:49.620 --> 03:55.340
channels and just as many, if not more, Twitch streams using each service's auto-claim process.

03:55.340 --> 03:58.640
And we all know how unforgiving this shit can be at times.

03:58.640 --> 04:03.660
Content ID is bad enough, where Scattershot matches auto-claim videos, even when the holder

04:03.660 --> 04:06.100
of the copyright doesn't want them to be claimed.

04:06.100 --> 04:10.620
But on both of these platforms, somebody like Maurer can show up, file a claim, and it just

04:10.620 --> 04:11.740
goes through.

04:11.740 --> 04:15.300
Nobody at Twitch or YouTube actually looks at the claim, it's all automated, it just

04:15.300 --> 04:19.080
goes through without a hitch, and it's on the channels involved to actually appeal them.

04:19.080 --> 04:22.860
And these strikes are no laughing matter for anybody who seriously values their channel.

04:22.860 --> 04:26.960
They constitute legal action that the platform must act upon in one way or another, and many

04:26.960 --> 04:32.700
channels have vanished, never to return, due to both valid and invalid DMCA notices.

04:32.740 --> 04:37.660
Many of the larger names that we all know and love, including Nintendo, Sega, Sony,

04:37.660 --> 04:41.500
Konami, and so on, have automated strikes issued in their name.

04:41.500 --> 04:46.100
I think every YouTuber, both large and small, has a story that they can tell about the DMCA,

04:46.100 --> 04:49.620
but I'll just stick to my own personal one, just to give you a sense of scale.

04:49.620 --> 04:54.460
Check this out, my gaming channel gets almost no traffic, I've got about 20 Twitch stream

04:54.460 --> 04:59.060
regulars, whom I all appreciate very much, and just as many views per Let's Play episode

04:59.060 --> 05:00.460
on YouTube on average.

05:00.460 --> 05:04.540
Do you really think that somebody over at Nintendo of Japan is issuing Japanese language

05:04.540 --> 05:08.340
copyright strikes on my 10 view Breath of the Wild Let's Play parts?

05:08.340 --> 05:11.900
If so, I would absolutely hate to be the dude doing that job, but I'm pretty sure this

05:11.900 --> 05:16.460
is all automated, with computers mass blanketing strikes wherever matches take them.

05:16.460 --> 05:20.500
Over the course of the past week, as all of this was unfolding, I actually emailed Mauer

05:20.500 --> 05:24.440
myself, to ask her exactly what was going on, but she didn't reply to me, probably

05:24.440 --> 05:26.140
because I'm a 500 sub pleb.

05:26.140 --> 05:29.580
However, a larger YouTuber by the name of Sid Alpha, who had also been watching the

05:29.580 --> 05:32.700
drama unfold, did in fact get a reply from her.

05:32.700 --> 05:33.700
Let's read it.

05:33.700 --> 05:38.260
The fact that Temi Noko, one of the YouTubers hit by Mauer's DMCA clams, is directing

05:38.260 --> 05:41.100
her complaints to me instead of the developer is a problem.

05:41.100 --> 05:45.300
This seems to be a general response of those who were hit with DMCA strikes.

05:45.300 --> 05:49.260
I did suggest to some who complained to me that I would reverse their DMCA strikes if

05:49.260 --> 05:51.540
they were willing to redirect their complaints to the developer.

05:51.540 --> 05:55.260
No one was willing to do so, and I no longer want to offer anyone the possibility of having

05:55.260 --> 05:57.540
their DMCA strikes reversed.

05:57.540 --> 05:58.540
Wow.

05:58.540 --> 06:00.260
So this is what this sounds like to me.

06:00.260 --> 06:03.580
Mauer, it sounds like you're pissed from being let go from Imajos Softworks.

06:03.580 --> 06:06.640
It sounds like you believe you should still have that job and be paid the remaining money

06:06.640 --> 06:07.860
from finishing the contract out.

06:07.860 --> 06:11.740
And it sounds like, rather than keep your dispute between you and Imajos, you would

06:11.740 --> 06:15.000
rather press-gang YouTubers into fighting for you in the court of public opinion, by

06:15.000 --> 06:19.100
filing DMCA notifications against their videos, and then telling them to redirect their complaints

06:19.100 --> 06:20.100
to Imajos.

06:20.100 --> 06:22.180
Except Imajos didn't file the notification.

06:22.180 --> 06:23.180
You did.

06:23.180 --> 06:24.440
That's your name there on the strike.

06:24.440 --> 06:25.440
Nobody else's.

06:25.440 --> 06:28.140
Let's be charitable towards your interpretation of events, Alex.

06:28.140 --> 06:31.820
Let's assume that Imajos Softworks let you go for a completely bullshit reason.

06:31.820 --> 06:35.340
Let's assume that you're entirely innocent, and that you should have been able to complete

06:35.340 --> 06:36.820
your work and get paid as promised.

06:36.820 --> 06:40.420
Let's even assume that Imajos Softworks' actions towards you were illegal.

06:40.420 --> 06:43.820
Why do you think that gives you the right to start issuing notifications against uninvolved

06:43.820 --> 06:45.280
third parties?

06:45.280 --> 06:46.940
What did you expect would happen here?

06:46.940 --> 06:50.420
Did you expect streamers and let's players to just give in and go fight Imajos on your

06:50.420 --> 06:51.420
behalf?

06:51.420 --> 06:53.940
Did you want to frame this as a David and Goliath situation?

06:53.940 --> 06:56.980
A poor video games composer versus the big bad company?

06:56.980 --> 06:59.380
Forming her out into the street with little recourse?

06:59.380 --> 07:03.620
Or maybe, did you want this to become a grassroots thing where mobs of people show up at Imagoza's

07:03.620 --> 07:05.220
digital doorstep to fight for your cause?

07:05.220 --> 07:08.300
Well, there's no fucking chance of that happening now, and then after you've threatened

07:08.300 --> 07:10.360
their channels with copyright strikes.

07:10.360 --> 07:13.460
Channels which, for some of these people, are their livelihoods.

07:13.460 --> 07:15.020
You know what might have worked?

07:15.020 --> 07:16.380
Alerting the games press.

07:16.380 --> 07:20.020
Yeah, Kotaku and Polygon and the others are absolute shit-suckers.

07:20.020 --> 07:22.880
But you're an indie woman apparently getting trampled by a company.

07:22.880 --> 07:24.060
They'd lap that shit up.

07:24.060 --> 07:25.500
They'd signal boost it among their crowd.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.820
And you may have actually ended up with some support.

07:27.820 --> 07:33.340
Or maybe contacting the YouTubers and streamers playing Star Mazer DSP without a DMCA claim

07:33.340 --> 07:36.780
and informing them of the situation and asking them to help raise awareness.

07:36.780 --> 07:39.860
Even a GoFundMe for your legal action would have probably worked.

07:39.860 --> 07:43.620
All of these options were available to you, but you chose to pursue legal action against

07:43.620 --> 07:44.620
uninvolved individuals.

07:44.620 --> 07:48.540
I'd ask you why, but I think I have a pretty reasonable assumption here.

07:48.540 --> 07:51.980
You don't really have a leg to stand on regarding your claims, and you know it.

07:51.980 --> 07:55.480
There are legal consequences to filing a false DMCA claim.

07:55.480 --> 08:00.220
Mauer lives in the USA, as do many of the people she's filed against, making the legalities

08:00.220 --> 08:02.140
of the situation a bit more straightforward.

08:02.140 --> 08:06.060
And I doubt she has the army of lawyers that a major game dev would use to stall countersuits

08:06.060 --> 08:07.520
until they fizzle out.

08:07.520 --> 08:12.820
If the use of content is covered by fair use laws, a DMCA claim is considered to be false.

08:12.820 --> 08:17.660
And even if the use of content is not covered by fair use laws, a contract that Mauer signed

08:17.660 --> 08:19.900
states that she does not actually own the content.

08:19.900 --> 08:23.900
And a DMCA claim filed for content one doesn't own is also considered to be false.

08:23.900 --> 08:26.620
Abuse of the DMCA does have legal consequences.

08:26.620 --> 08:30.560
If Mauer's interpretation of the contract is upheld over the course of any legal battle

08:30.560 --> 08:34.540
she undertakes with Imago Softworks, many of these strikes and claims will also be upheld

08:34.540 --> 08:35.580
as legitimate.

08:35.580 --> 08:39.860
But if Mauer's interpretation is not upheld, she has opened the door wide for many content

08:39.860 --> 08:44.260
creators to set precedents regarding copyright law as it pertains to streams and let's plays,

08:44.260 --> 08:47.480
as well as absolutely destroying herself financially and legally.

08:47.480 --> 08:50.800
Either way, I think she's already destroyed herself professionally.

08:50.800 --> 08:55.240
Despite her impressive body of work, I don't think anybody would ever dare hire her again.

08:55.240 --> 08:59.600
However, as the week went on, rather than back down, apologize, delete Facebook, lawyer

08:59.600 --> 09:03.360
up and hit the gym, Mauer decided instead to double down.

09:03.360 --> 09:07.800
She began filing DMCAs against people who had done videos on Duck Game and Death Road

09:07.800 --> 09:12.560
to Canada, games unrelated to the Imago debacle but ones that she did work on, as well as

09:12.560 --> 09:16.840
sending a cease and desist to Turner Broadcasting due to their own involvement in Duck Game.

09:16.840 --> 09:17.840
Holy shit.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.280
Let's see what she actually has to say about it.

09:19.280 --> 09:22.880
I don't have to give anyone permission to have my music be in their videos.

09:22.880 --> 09:27.280
I told people to contact Imagos because Imagos is responsible for releasing a game that violated

09:27.280 --> 09:28.280
copyright.

09:28.280 --> 09:32.560
Also, I don't think that video recording yourself playing video games is a realistic job.

09:32.560 --> 09:35.880
Creating video games is, and it is a very risky business to be in.

09:35.880 --> 09:39.680
This is a continuation of her previous stance regarding her owning the rights to Starmazer

09:39.680 --> 09:41.720
DSP's soundtrack, not Imagos.

09:41.720 --> 09:45.800
But it's also a rebuke that many content creators face by a lot of less than charitable individuals.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.640
That it's not a real job.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.240
A job is what pays the bills.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.240
Period.

09:50.240 --> 09:53.420
Alex, did you know that at one time, being involved in television wasn't considered

09:53.420 --> 09:54.420
a job?

09:54.420 --> 09:56.440
Or being involved in radio?

09:56.440 --> 10:00.360
Did you know that at one time, people stood around in a field to watch very basic airplanes

10:00.360 --> 10:05.280
fly about 40 or 50 feet, say to themselves, golly gee, isn't that something, but never

10:05.280 --> 10:09.660
once considered that a multi-billion dollar industry would spring up from that innovation?

10:09.660 --> 10:12.920
Every single time there's a new invention or new medium, there will be people who may

10:12.920 --> 10:18.240
think that it's a novelty, but does not actually consist of any real work beyond hobbyism.

10:18.240 --> 10:23.240
Let me repeat, Alex, streaming and let's playing is not a real job to you.

10:23.240 --> 10:26.960
Likely because you're 34 years old, and grew up in an environment where such a thing

10:26.960 --> 10:27.960
was unthinkable.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.120
Thankfully for the rest of us, we've moved beyond that.

10:30.120 --> 10:34.040
And as a quick aside, TotalBiscuit got involved in all this bullshit too, quipping that, for

10:34.040 --> 10:37.680
this not being a real job, it sure as hell can afford the lawyers that Alex's real

10:37.680 --> 10:39.000
job seemingly can't.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
I love you bro.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.120
TB decided to reach out to YouTube Gaming and Twitch using the clout of his own channel,

10:44.120 --> 10:47.720
in order to help expedite some of the counterclaims filed by smaller channels against Maurer's

10:47.720 --> 10:48.720
bullshit.

10:48.720 --> 10:52.400
Additionally, a GoFundMe was set up to help pay for legal expenses against Maurer, which

10:52.400 --> 10:55.640
hit $10,000 in under 24 hours.

10:55.640 --> 10:58.560
It's still going by the way, so please go donate if you can.

10:58.560 --> 11:03.120
At the time of recording this video, they need another 2,000 American, and I have confidence

11:03.120 --> 11:04.680
that we can scrape it together.

11:04.680 --> 11:08.640
Additionally, even though it's been a very long time since August 2014, the internet

11:08.640 --> 11:13.440
still has no tolerance for unethical practices, and I'm personally absolutely proud of you

11:13.440 --> 11:14.440
guys for that.

11:14.440 --> 11:18.880
Here's Maurer addressing TemiNeko, the content creator she mentioned earlier as being one

11:18.880 --> 11:20.800
of the ones she refused to back down on.

11:20.800 --> 11:23.640
Thanks for helping me get death threats for doing nothing wrong.

11:23.640 --> 11:26.200
These death threats are coming from people who have my address.

11:26.200 --> 11:30.200
They are literally ruining my livelihood, as in whether or not I'm alive.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.200
Happy?

11:31.200 --> 11:35.360
Now of course, I don't think anybody should be sending actual fucking threats to anybody.

11:35.360 --> 11:39.040
And man, if you're doing this sort of thing for the lulz or whatever, please stop.

11:39.040 --> 11:43.040
But doesn't this whole thing sound familiar to any of you who went through gamergate?

11:43.040 --> 11:47.160
Didn't Brianna Wu, Nita Sarkeesian, Zoe Quinn, and many others start complaining about this

11:47.160 --> 11:51.400
type of shit as soon as they started getting seriously criticized for their unethical practices?

11:51.400 --> 11:54.900
Maybe the call of victim bucks was just too seducing for Maurer to ignore.

11:54.900 --> 11:58.040
But unlike the aforementioned fraudsters, there's probably not going to be much money

11:58.040 --> 11:59.320
for Maurer in all of it.

11:59.320 --> 12:02.980
She's destroyed absolutely everything around her to the point that even the SJW Gaming

12:02.980 --> 12:05.040
cabal seems to be reluctant to get involved.

12:05.040 --> 12:09.200
Over time, Maurer's comments on the topic began to become more and more deranged.

12:09.200 --> 12:12.720
Fucking playing video games is not a job!

12:12.720 --> 12:16.560
If there was a way to DMCA punch you in the face through my computer screen, I would.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.520
You and your fucking friends do not have the right to post videos with my music.

12:19.520 --> 12:23.680
The DMCA system exists so I can say no when the creepy fucking people like you are trying

12:23.680 --> 12:25.120
to fuck my music.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.120
Fuck you.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.280
This sounds like a 50-50 mix of a grumpy old father who doesn't approve of his kid's

12:29.280 --> 12:33.480
career choice and a whining child who's throwing a tantrum when things don't go her way.

12:33.480 --> 12:37.400
Another YouTuber by the name of Musical Anti-Hero managed to get a hold of Alex Maurer and conduct

12:37.400 --> 12:40.560
an interview regarding this whole Star Mazer DSP debacle.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.680
There was honestly nothing too special about it.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.400
Musical Anti-Hero brought up the same points that many others brought up regarding the

12:45.400 --> 12:49.080
use of DMCA, YouTubing being a legitimate source of income, and so on.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.720
Maurer, of course, restated her positions.

12:50.720 --> 12:54.800
But the video Musical Anti-Hero did on the interview was, you guessed it, hit with a

12:54.800 --> 12:56.680
copyright claim by Alex Maurer.

12:56.680 --> 13:01.140
The video itself had none of Maurer's content, and none of Imajos' content in it.

13:01.140 --> 13:03.400
It was entirely Musical Anti-Hero's content.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.480
What was Maurer's twisted reasoning this time?

13:05.480 --> 13:09.000
He used an old photograph from before my gender transition in his video.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.520
It's an extremely sensitive issue for trans people.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.840
I asked him to take it down and he said he would.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.920
Over 12 hours later it was still up, so I decided to report it.

13:16.920 --> 13:19.880
The photo came from my camera and I technically owned the copyright.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.320
Are you fucking kidding me?

13:21.320 --> 13:23.800
I don't care that Alex Maurer turned out to be trans.

13:23.800 --> 13:27.240
She apparently goes by Niki Maurer sometimes, but still seems to use Alex.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.200
It's a gender neutral name anyway, and it's ultimately a non-issue.

13:30.200 --> 13:34.000
And I understand why it may be sensitive to have pre-transition photos thrown about

13:34.000 --> 13:37.640
when you're trans, even though Maurer uploaded said photo herself.

13:37.640 --> 13:41.540
And I'm not even interested in arguing her trans status, even though transtrenders are

13:41.540 --> 13:45.880
absolutely a thing, gender questioning and confused individuals are absolutely a thing,

13:45.880 --> 13:50.400
and just blatantly faking trans status for SJW support is absolutely a thing.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.880
But an individual's face is not automatically protected by copyright.

13:53.880 --> 13:57.820
That is not a right that you intrinsically have simply for owning your own face.

13:57.820 --> 14:02.100
And showing a pre-transition photo is clearly not justification for abuse of the DMCA.

14:02.100 --> 14:05.940
It's about at this point in the story that Imogos just got fucking fed up with the whole

14:05.940 --> 14:06.940
thing.

14:06.940 --> 14:10.300
Imogos began to move forward with legal action against Maurer, stating in a Twitter PM that

14:10.300 --> 14:14.360
"...we have become represented by Leonard French in this case and we intend to litigate.

14:14.360 --> 14:18.100
We are seeking absolutely no damages in this action, only a court-ordered establishment

14:18.100 --> 14:22.200
of our queer defined rights chain and subsequently the place in that chain for YouTubers who

14:22.200 --> 14:23.200
have been affected."

14:23.200 --> 14:26.940
Leonard French, the attorney hired by Imogos, as well as the one behind the GoFundMe intended

14:26.940 --> 14:30.940
to help protect content creators affected by Maurer, released this statement on behalf

14:30.940 --> 14:32.420
of Don Thacker of Imogos.

14:32.420 --> 14:35.400
"...it is with a heavy heart that I announce that we have a plan to help the community

14:35.400 --> 14:38.580
and Imogos through the legal gauntlet that Alex Maurer has set for us.

14:38.580 --> 14:41.980
We feel it is our duty and responsibility to do what we can to mitigate the damage Alex

14:41.980 --> 14:42.980
has caused."

14:42.980 --> 14:46.560
Don's journey with Alex began seven years ago when he met her at PAX East after asking

14:46.560 --> 14:47.900
her to work on one of his films.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.600
They quickly became friends.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.900
Her talent and skill as a musician and artist was readily apparent.

14:52.900 --> 14:55.740
Don and Alex worked on several titles together over the years.

14:55.740 --> 15:00.300
In 2015, Don saw the opportunity to create Starmazer, a dream he had since he was nine

15:00.300 --> 15:01.300
years old.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.500
Don asked Alex to create the music and sound effects assets for the game.

15:04.500 --> 15:08.020
The Kickstarter, the development, the team, it was all a dream come true.

15:08.020 --> 15:10.340
But then Alex's behavior began to change.

15:10.340 --> 15:13.780
Slowly at first, it had become what you have seen publicly recently.

15:13.780 --> 15:17.660
Don tried to keep the matter as quiet as possible out of respect for Alex and in the hope that

15:17.660 --> 15:22.380
the situation would be resolved peacefully, amicably, and to the benefit of everyone.

15:22.380 --> 15:25.860
Unfortunately, the copyright system in the United States has allowed her to assert rights

15:25.860 --> 15:30.080
that she does not actually own, and her assertion of those rights has caused Imigos and Don

15:30.080 --> 15:33.380
to lose credibility with many of the people and companies that they do business with.

15:33.380 --> 15:37.720
This has resulted in Imigos and Don losing developers, financial support, potential and

15:37.720 --> 15:41.700
existing film clients, and that has further caused them all a great deal of stress.

15:41.700 --> 15:44.420
Alex has recently become very public about the matter.

15:44.420 --> 15:48.140
We have decided to pursue court action solely to educate Imigos' rights and to clear up

15:48.140 --> 15:49.140
any dispute with Alex.

15:49.140 --> 15:53.020
This is all in the hopes that the developers, including Don, can continue with their first

15:53.020 --> 15:54.940
left, development of the game.

15:54.940 --> 15:58.900
It is and always has been my understanding that Imigos owns valid copyrights in all their

15:58.900 --> 16:00.980
works from which Alex has issued takedowns.

16:00.980 --> 16:05.460
It is also my understanding and position that Alex has no right to issue takedowns for Imigos'

16:05.460 --> 16:06.580
and related content.

16:06.580 --> 16:10.380
Imigos and Don have engaged me to pursue these legal rights as reasonably and appropriately

16:10.380 --> 16:11.380
as possible.

16:11.380 --> 16:14.920
It is our primary goal to establish Imigos' rights and the community's rights to publish

16:14.920 --> 16:17.700
Star Mazer and Star Mazer DSP content.

16:17.700 --> 16:20.980
Meanwhile, Maura continued her long descent off the deep end.

16:20.980 --> 16:25.380
I just expect former clients to not disclose copies of paper containing my contact info,

16:25.380 --> 16:27.680
redacted social security number, and signature.

16:27.680 --> 16:31.420
For all I know, you creepy fucking scumbags might photoshop my signature from the document

16:31.420 --> 16:35.700
into other things, to sign me up for shit like credit cards or god knows what the fuck.

16:35.700 --> 16:36.700
Go ahead.

16:36.700 --> 16:40.660
I dare you to fucking do that and see how long Don Thacker remains out of jail.

16:40.660 --> 16:43.940
Oh, and if you could all stop threatening my life now that would be good.

16:43.940 --> 16:46.860
For all I know, someone is going to be standing outside of my house waiting for me.

16:46.900 --> 16:49.020
I may as well go buy a gun for protection.

16:49.020 --> 16:50.020
Let's see your doxxing.

16:50.020 --> 16:51.880
Uh, that's 1x love.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.480
Fucking faces, meet me outside of my house with all that shit now.

16:54.480 --> 16:57.120
I guess that's a part of the job description for YouTuber now?

16:57.120 --> 16:59.780
Death threats and meeting people outside their doxxed fucking houses?

16:59.780 --> 17:03.140
There's a lot to reply here, but I'll just say one thing.

17:03.140 --> 17:06.820
There is no job description for YouTuber, it's apparently not a real job.

17:06.820 --> 17:10.700
Sid Alpha, the original YouTuber that actually managed to get a reply from Maura back when

17:10.700 --> 17:15.860
this all started, was soon sent another message from her, that simply stated, I want to literally

17:15.860 --> 17:16.860
kill you.

17:16.860 --> 17:20.940
In a short span of time, she went from being apparently fearful of her life from death

17:20.940 --> 17:23.300
threats, to issuing one herself.

17:23.300 --> 17:26.060
Sid Alpha's reply was only, oh, do you?

17:26.060 --> 17:29.300
Maura quickly replied again with, never ask for my comment again.

17:29.300 --> 17:32.060
You are a cyberbully, 100,000%.

17:32.060 --> 17:34.640
And you are transphobic, seriously.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.140
You think your fucking cisgender world is all that exists?

17:37.140 --> 17:38.620
You think I don't own a photograph of myself?

17:38.620 --> 17:40.080
Then you're a fucking robot.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.580
I want to kill myself, but I have to kill you first.

17:42.580 --> 17:46.180
It's here that we've hit the rock bottom of the situation, and also where Maura herself

17:46.180 --> 17:48.540
has hit rock bottom in her personal life.

17:48.540 --> 17:52.820
What comes next is entirely my own speculation, but I think this is what happened.

17:52.820 --> 17:56.020
Alex Maura's mental health has been on a slow decline for a while now.

17:56.020 --> 18:00.320
I think this decline caused her to lose her job with Imogos, which most likely contributed

18:00.320 --> 18:04.220
to Maura's furthering instability due to her close friendship with Don Thacker, the

18:04.220 --> 18:07.300
man who had befriended her nearly a decade ago and brought her on as both a colleague

18:07.300 --> 18:08.300
and pal.

18:08.300 --> 18:10.860
This was likely extremely personal for Maura.

18:10.860 --> 18:14.860
It wasn't about the YouTubers, and it wasn't about Imogos, it was most likely about Don.

18:14.860 --> 18:17.220
It could have been a betrayal of friendship on the job.

18:17.220 --> 18:18.960
It could have been romantic in nature.

18:18.960 --> 18:22.380
It could have been just the slow decline of an individual due to other unrelated mental

18:22.380 --> 18:26.060
problems that was compounded first by the firing, and second by the massive internet

18:26.060 --> 18:27.060
backlash.

18:27.060 --> 18:28.060
Who knows?

18:28.060 --> 18:29.660
I don't think any of us ever will.

18:29.660 --> 18:33.620
But this all smacks of a personal dispute that exploded wildly into the realm of DMCAs

18:33.620 --> 18:34.620
and SJW bullshit.

18:34.620 --> 18:38.060
And yes, I do say SJW bullshit for a reason.

18:38.060 --> 18:41.320
Alex Maurer followed a tried and true formula that Gamergate knows well.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.080
You start with unethical practices.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.900
Add in a spice of accused privilege and power for your opponent.

18:45.900 --> 18:49.660
When things hit the court of public opinion, cry harassment to all your detractors.

18:49.660 --> 18:53.580
When things get worse, claim bigotry by any possible metric you can.

18:53.580 --> 18:55.320
In this case, transphobia.

18:55.320 --> 18:59.940
Overblow any death threats, insults, and harassment you may receive, and begin issuing similar

18:59.940 --> 19:02.180
death threats, insults, and harassment yourself.

19:02.180 --> 19:04.160
There's one big difference, though.

19:04.160 --> 19:09.040
At the end of this formula, all the big SJW names, the Zoe's, the Anita's, they get

19:09.040 --> 19:11.240
money, prestige, and protection.

19:11.240 --> 19:16.040
Instead, Maurer got isolation, legal repercussions, and eventually a complete mental breakdown

19:16.040 --> 19:18.800
causing her to seek the help that she so obviously needs.

19:18.800 --> 19:22.880
Leonard French, Imogosa's lawyer, posted a video on Maurer's final collapse.

19:48.800 --> 19:57.760
Eventually became actual threats of imminent bodily injury or harm.

19:57.760 --> 20:06.620
At one point, I was threatened with having my windows broken, my building set on fire.

20:06.620 --> 20:10.040
There were some colorful ones in there that I'll leave out because I don't want to encourage

20:10.040 --> 20:13.500
it.

20:13.500 --> 20:19.780
There was, of course, this ever-present image of a knife to her neck, and she said that

20:19.780 --> 20:22.860
that wasn't a suicide threat, it was something else.

20:22.860 --> 20:25.100
Literally, she said something else.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.100
Okay.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.100
Whatever that is.

20:27.100 --> 20:35.300
I have been searching and investigating and doing a lot, a lot of back behind-the-scenes

20:35.300 --> 20:43.460
efforts to try and find Alec's help, and the long and the short of it is that we were able

20:43.460 --> 20:48.240
to get Alec's some help, not me alone.

20:48.240 --> 21:05.500
It was an effort of a lot of people, including people I didn't expect, so thank you for all

21:05.500 --> 21:11.800
of you who came together to help an obviously suffering individual in her time of need.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.760
The DMCA claims have been redacted.

21:13.760 --> 21:17.560
Alex is receiving some form of help, which has been kept confidential.

21:17.560 --> 21:19.720
And yes, the legal action is still going forward.

21:19.720 --> 21:22.400
I think it's important to really split this into two discussions here.

21:22.400 --> 21:27.460
Alex Maurer has abused the DMCA, has hurt a lot of people, and must face whatever appropriate

21:27.460 --> 21:29.560
punishment is deemed necessary for that.

21:29.560 --> 21:33.280
Imogosa's rights need to be protected, as do the rights of the continent creators dragged

21:33.280 --> 21:34.520
into this unwillingly.

21:34.520 --> 21:37.200
At the same time, Alex Maurer is clearly suffering.

21:37.200 --> 21:41.200
She did all of this of her own volition, but guys, it's not worth her life or her health.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.680
She's still a person who needs help.

21:42.680 --> 21:46.200
Her actions, and her punishment for those actions, and her issues and the potential

21:46.200 --> 21:48.680
for her recovery are two different things.

21:48.680 --> 21:50.460
I want to make one thing absolutely clear.

21:50.460 --> 21:54.360
It is my opinion that the curious case of Alex Maurer ended on a good note because despite

21:54.360 --> 21:59.120
her self-claimed status as a trans woman in the gaming industry, Alex Maurer had no institutional

21:59.120 --> 22:01.880
support from the usual anti-Gamergate suspects.

22:01.880 --> 22:02.880
No Journos.

22:02.880 --> 22:03.880
No Gamergazi.

22:03.880 --> 22:04.880
No feminist frequency.

22:04.880 --> 22:05.880
No crash override.

22:05.880 --> 22:08.200
Nothing from the usual suspects on Twitter or YouTube.

22:08.200 --> 22:13.020
I'm sure she, at one time, positioned herself as the next Zoe Quinn, at least in her head,

22:13.020 --> 22:15.200
but thankfully that didn't manifest in reality.

22:15.200 --> 22:18.960
When the support wasn't there from the SJW clique, the only option left was to seek

22:18.960 --> 22:20.040
professional help.

22:20.040 --> 22:23.720
Which really makes me think, how many others that Gamergate knows so well are in the same

22:23.720 --> 22:24.720
boat?

22:24.720 --> 22:27.440
What if there's a nugget of goodness in people like Zoe and Anita and Brianna and

22:27.440 --> 22:32.040
so many others, covered up by years of bad habits, of corruption, of self-destructive

22:32.040 --> 22:34.320
tendencies, of social justice inculcation?

22:34.440 --> 22:39.520
SJWs and feminist YouTubers are, slowly but surely, starting to come around, not becoming

22:39.520 --> 22:43.680
anti-SJW or anti-feminist zealots, but at least beginning to use their critical thought

22:43.680 --> 22:46.720
processes more actively, and getting punished by the clique for it.

22:46.720 --> 22:49.000
Laci Green is a great recent example of this.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.480
She's nowhere near to being an anti-feminist as far as I can tell, but just talking to

22:52.480 --> 22:55.360
the antis has caused her own group to excommunicate her.

22:55.360 --> 22:59.000
It's my opinion that the hardcore strands of social justice indoctrinate in the way

22:59.000 --> 23:03.240
that an extremist intolerant religion does, and when the ideology is threatened, the natural

23:03.240 --> 23:05.920
reaction is to go deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole.

23:05.920 --> 23:10.240
I don't know if Alex is actually trans, and that her transness brought her into social

23:10.240 --> 23:15.920
justice, which inevitably led her into the sorry mental state she found herself in, or

23:15.920 --> 23:20.080
if her claims of being trans were a side effect of an already fragile mental state to begin

23:20.080 --> 23:21.080
with.

23:21.080 --> 23:22.080
Here's what I do think, though.

23:22.080 --> 23:26.120
Alex Maurer's claims of transphobia near the endpoint, as a person who already had

23:26.120 --> 23:30.280
emotional or mental issues, showed that those issues were rapidly compounded by exposure

23:30.280 --> 23:32.360
to extremist social justice views.

23:32.360 --> 23:37.260
Like any religion, like any cult, the SJW mindset needs only a small opening to turn

23:37.260 --> 23:41.140
your average person with a bit of depression into an emotional wreck, self-destructing

23:41.140 --> 23:43.360
constantly and taking everything down with them.

23:43.360 --> 23:45.640
I think this is what happened to Alex Maurer.

23:45.640 --> 23:49.900
And I think, if people like Zoe and Anita and Brianna didn't have the massive amount

23:49.900 --> 23:54.440
of wealth, connections, and privilege that they do, it would be happening to them too.

23:54.440 --> 23:57.840
But in the end, it was a good thing that Alex Maurer didn't have them, because her lack

23:57.840 --> 24:00.240
of them is what allowed her to get the help that she needs.

24:00.240 --> 24:03.040
At least, regarding that, I'm very happy for.

24:03.040 --> 24:09.440
But please, stop selling Chiptune albums for a thousand bucks, Alex.

24:09.440 --> 24:10.440
Thanks for watching, guys.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.920
This is the second Indefensible in a week, and I'm happy to say that I'm back to

24:12.920 --> 24:14.180
doing this stuff full-time.

24:14.180 --> 24:18.020
It won't always be Indefensibles, it might be political stuff in the style of my Trouble

24:18.020 --> 24:21.680
with Trudeau video, but I plan to keep this channel updated regularly from now on.

24:21.680 --> 24:25.120
Thanks to all of you supporters on the SFO Patreon who motivate me to keep doing this

24:25.120 --> 24:29.040
stuff, even when I thought that I couldn't do it myself and had nothing of value to contribute

24:29.040 --> 24:30.040
to the community.

24:30.040 --> 24:34.880
And, just as a treat, this video should be releasing on the morning of July 1st, 2017,

24:34.880 --> 24:37.280
the 150th anniversary of Canada's founding.

24:37.280 --> 24:41.680
To celebrate both Canada Day and Alex Maurer's hopefully impending recovery, my friends and

24:41.680 --> 24:46.320
I are going to be streaming Death Road to Canada over at twitch.tv slash sharpadotaku,

24:46.320 --> 24:48.120
one of Alex Maurer's games.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.420
Please don't DM CAS.

24:49.420 --> 24:53.080
The stream should be going right when this video goes live, so come say hi, I'd love

24:53.080 --> 24:54.080
to chat with you.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.280
Alright guys, I love you.

24:55.280 --> 24:55.760
See you next time.
