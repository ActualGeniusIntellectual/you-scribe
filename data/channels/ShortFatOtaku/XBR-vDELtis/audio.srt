1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
Hey guys, Dev here. I've, uh, I've gardened at this location for about four or five years now, but I haven't really documented it.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,640
So maybe, maybe I'll do that this year. So here we are. This is my gardening video. I guess I'm taking the idea from Styx.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,200
I don't have quite as magnificent a garden as his though. Um, this is a very small location as you can see.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:25,360
There's, there's our deck. There's our shed. We only had this little bit of land to do a garden with.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,360
Before I moved in, there was like nothing there. It was just like weeds and a few stones. And I was like, you know what?

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,160
I'll, uh, I'll make a garden out of it, but why not? And I mean, I didn't have much money back then.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:42,120
Um, so I used a door. As you can see, there is a door and it's kind of weathered at this point.

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,360
There's a door there. There's a door in the back as well for the back part.

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,400
And the rest is just made out of scrap wood that we had lying around. This is like a low income area.

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:59,160
So, uh, when we moved in, there was a lot of just scrap wood and random junk and garbage lying around.

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,040
And we cleaned the place up pretty nicely. But I, uh, I kept all the wood in case I ever wanted to do something like this one day.

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,240
And well, now I have. Anyway, it's late April. I just opened the garden up. There's just some leaves in there.

13
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,840
I've been digging around and just mixing things together. I'll probably have some plants to put in by, uh, by next week.

14
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,960
That's the plan anyway. So I'll come back next week. Oh yeah. Also those stones that I used for the little path, those were also scavenged.

15
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,080
There was just like, there was just like little bricks hanging around for some, I don't know why. I don't know.

16
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,760
A lot of this place doesn't really make much sense. Anyway, I'll see you when the plants get here.

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:40,560
And we've got the plants. Here we go. I've got kale, peppers, cucumber and tomatoes.

18
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,280
Those there are just herbs. And this is a celery butt that I've chopped.

19
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,760
And it's actually, I don't know if you can see it because of the sunlight, but it's actually starting to grow there.

20
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,640
Is it even a dish of water? And, uh, I'd say in a week's time I can probably put all these in.

21
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,800
So the plants are all in. It's been a week since you last saw them.

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,760
Um, some of them are a little bit wilted from being inside. I don't know if it's not enough water or not enough sun.

23
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,280
I did water them every day, but it doesn't matter. Hopefully they will survive out here.

24
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:21,560
So the garden is filled with eight kale, eight peppers, eight, um, tomatoes and 10 cucumbers,

25
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,880
as well as two celery butts that I chopped up and put in there.

26
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,280
You can get those two there. And along the edge here are some peas.

27
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:40,400
Now, what I've done is there was actually a bunch of, um, a bunch of scrap wood that wasn't being used.

28
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,080
Just lying around the property. So I gathered it up and I made a very ramshackle lattice.

29
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,520
I'm going to put some mesh in between these bits of lattice.

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,600
So that bit over there will hold all the cucumbers and they'll grow out probably onto the deck.

31
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:03,960
And then this bit here, I'll put a lattice there and that'll be where the peas go up, up to the top of the shed.

32
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,000
It's about a week later, guys, and I had to do some replanting.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,840
A few of the plants died, in fact. It wasn't due to frosting or anything like that.

34
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:19,240
It's been above zero this whole time, but basically I got some of the seedlings from a, I'd say, a less than reputable source.

35
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,000
So I went out, got some more. I had to replant four cucumber. That's that row there.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,720
Got a couple more kales. Got some red kale just to spice it up. Got some more peppers.

37
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,960
Garden update, guys. Here's the current state of my garden.

38
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:42,840
As it turns out, this is the end of May right now, and we had a freak hit of frost, potential frost.

39
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,120
And, you know, might not have been frost actually, but who knows?

40
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,880
My neighbor's garden is, in fact, covered up in much the same way.

41
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,480
So I had no way to actually cover the plants.

42
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,880
So we just put down garbage bags and other things and weighed them down.

43
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,880
I'm about to pull everything else off. Let's see if, let's see if stuff survived.

44
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,720
Let's move this aside.

45
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,200
Come on. Yeah, looks like the plant is just fine.

46
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,080
So I'll be pulling all this stuff off and we will get back to regular gardening.

47
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,000
This is now mid-June. Check it out, guys. Those peppers aren't going at all.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,840
But I think peppers take some time. It's about time for the first harvesting of the kale.

49
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,840
Same with the lettuce. The peas are starting to climb. That's good.

50
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,080
There's a squirtle in there. Can you see him? Maybe he's gone now. Oh, well.

51
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,240
And the cucumbers still just kind of seem to be stunted. I hope things turn out.

52
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:56,840
It's now about the, what would it be, near the end of June. And this is the garden now.

53
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,000
The celery died. I have no idea why. I guess I can't do celery.

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,720
But peppers are going good. There's a lot of snap peas, man.

55
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,840
Tomatoes good. Cucumbers came back. Lots of lettuce. We've been eating the lettuce.

56
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,040
We've been eating the kale. Some pretty excellent. Here, let's see if I can get a snap pea, actually.

57
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,400
Yeah, check this guy out. Check this guy out.

58
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,600
Look at that. Hell yeah.

59
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,840
It's pretty good. All right, so it is about, I'd say, early July.

60
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,240
The pepper plants are all going great. We'll probably have peppers soon. Look at those pepper flowers, man.

61
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,720
Yeah. I'm out here primarily to harvest the kale. There is so much kale, man.

62
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,080
Look at that. That one little kale in the corner didn't really go anywhere.

63
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,360
But the rest of it's going good. You see back there, cucumbers.

64
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,840
There's some cucumbers in there I got to pick, but the cucumbers are growing up the lattice quite nicely.

65
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,480
That is a lettuce that I failed to harvest. I completely forgot about it.

66
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,200
And that's just a ton of seeds. But the actual leaves are still good.

67
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,640
There's the tomatoes. Tomatoes are really overgrowing. Basically everything is kind of growing like crazy.

68
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,280
Look at it. Look at it. Wow. That's a lot of food, but still.

69
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,200
There's the peas. I've been eating a lot of the snap peas.

70
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,640
You can see there's actually one right there. In fact, it's ready to go.

71
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,560
But something I've noticed. How come some of the snap pea leaves are turning white at the bottom?

72
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,640
What's the deal there? But in any case, though, the snap peas are generally doing fine.

73
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,640
I'm probably going to be harvesting right now. In fact, basil needs to be cut.

74
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,720
There's a basil plant there. That's spicy basil. And this is just regular basil.

75
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,360
They both need to be cut. So I'm going to do that right now. Ah, geez, I'm sweating everywhere.

76
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:53,520
So here's the haul. There's three cucumbers. There was actually four, but my dad grabbed one when he came over to visit earlier this morning.

77
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:00,880
There's a baggie full of basil. There's three baggies, three very big baggies full of kale that we put in my freezer.

78
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,120
I generally use it for smoothies and stuff, so I just freeze it and put it in a smoothie when I'm done.

79
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,800
And there is a very big lettuce plant that I let go to seed, mainly out of laziness.

80
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Oops. But all those leaves down at the bottom are still good. So I'll be having salad tonight.

81
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,880
Um, here's the look of the garden now that all the kale plants have been have been cut.

82
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,840
And they'll they'll just keep growing. You can kind of see this one here. That that's like three harvests worth of trimming.

83
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,800
It'll just bloom out at the top again and I'll trim it again.

84
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,440
And these things will get to be a couple of feet high by the end of the year with all the various trimmings.

85
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,480
I just noticed there's a there's a big tomato right there. That's that's coming along nicely.

86
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,840
But I don't quite understand is why some of the lettuce regrew and some of it didn't.

87
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:51,280
So, for example, see if we can see this. Can I show you properly?

88
00:07:51,280 --> 00:08:00,200
This is the lettuce stump that I just cut. OK, this down here is the lettuce stump that I cut like two weeks ago.

89
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,960
And there's a bunch of new growth coming out of it. So new lettuce is growing out of the stump.

90
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,120
I cut this stump in the same way and it's not growing at all. I think it just died.

91
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,880
I don't quite know the difference as to why sometimes lettuce comes back and sometimes it doesn't.

92
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,680
I left a few bottom leaves on this stump in the hope that the leaves will help it grow back.

93
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,360
So I'll get more lettuce because I would rather these lettuce these lettuce plants that I bought not be one and done.

94
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,320
But who knows? Oh, yeah. I also did harvest some some snap peas, but I ate them all.

95
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,680
There's a bunch of small ones here at the top. You can see that there's a whole bunch of small ones at the top.

96
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,120
I'm just I'm just waiting for those for a couple of days for them to be bigger.

97
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,680
I like them generally bigger than this. This is this is a good size.

98
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,080
I'm going to grab that right now in fact. Yeah. That's delicious, man.

99
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,360
And I should probably point out gardening is not hard, but it's also not easy.

100
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,800
But there are people who are like, I can't garden. I can't do it. Actually, Sargon said this once that he didn't know what to do about gardening.

101
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,440
Well, I mean, I'm not I'm not like as pro as Stixxenhammer or something.

102
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,080
I do end up getting store-bought plants. And once the gardens filled in, I just basically dug holes,

103
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,160
put a little bit of a sheep manure in the bottom, just a handful and put the plant in.

104
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:15,280
And here you go. Water every day, every morning, and you're set like it takes some work initially, but now it's just kind of going on its own.

105
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,160
I just got to basically remember to water as part of my morning routine. So it's not that hard.

106
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,480
Sargon, if you ever actually end up listening to this video, I I know you have a yard.

107
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:30,720
I recommend you trying it out and everyone else, too. If you have a spot where you can garden, I actually definitely I definitely recommend giving it a try.

108
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,360
So as you can see, I've picked off all the usable leaves from that lettuce and put them in a bowl.

109
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,080
I'm going to put it in the fridge. So the plan is get yourself a piece of paper towel.

110
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,880
Add water to it. Drench it in water. You drench it in water. You can hear me.

111
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:56,760
Don't rip it, though. Just make sure it's like completely soaked and you like lay it on top of the bowl of lettuce like so.

112
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,960
There you go. And that will keep the lettuce moist and relatively crunchy for several days.

113
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,480
Now, because I did wait until it was a giant stock and I didn't harvest it earlier, this lettuce will be a little bit bitter, but it's still good to eat.

114
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,600
It'll just it'll just be a little bit better than normal, but that's fine. It's not a big deal.

115
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,600
It is now late July and look at it. Look at it, guys. The the basil.

116
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,480
I put another trim. I've been cutting the kale recently.

117
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:32,000
However, this type of kale here didn't really do so well. These traditional plants are doing great, though.

118
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,200
Check out the peppers growing. Look at that. Yeah, man.

119
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,560
Peppers growing on the pepper plants. They're coming in everywhere.

120
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:48,640
Look. Yeah, man. The peas aren't doing so well.

121
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,440
And frankly, I don't know why I've been watering them.

122
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,400
I've been weeding around them, but they're all just turning yellow.

123
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,040
They're still growing peas, but I don't know quite what to do about it.

124
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,640
You know, tomatoes are going crazy.

125
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,640
There's a bunch of tomatoes in there so you can reach one. Can you see that in there?

126
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,600
Yes. They'll be coming along in a few weeks. The lettuce just gave up.

127
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,280
That's done. You can see that stump there regrowing, but it's not going to take off.

128
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,680
I got to do something different with the lettuce next year. And here's the cucumber patch.

129
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,040
Look at this. That's almost ready to eat, isn't it?

130
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,960
Maybe another day or two just to get a little bit thicker.

131
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:38,240
But, yeah, the cucumbers are winding their way up properly.

132
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,040
Actually, maybe I'll adjust this one right here. I want it.

133
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,960
Don't grab onto the lettuce plant or the tomato plant.

134
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,360
Come on. Off. Off. Let go.

135
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:58,320
Yeah, I'm going to try to get them to grow this way so they'll climb up this trellis here.

136
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,480
Yeah, you see those cucumbers in there? Yeah, it's doing great.

137
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,360
It's doing pretty good.

138
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,800
I think what I'll change next year, though, is I have a planter that I'll put the lettuce in.

139
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,880
And I'll put seeds down so it kind of grows like grass.

140
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,280
I can just snip it rather than have to deal with full hearts.

141
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,160
Probably more cucumbers in this corner. This stuff will all be the same.

142
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:29,840
And maybe I'll go for the traditional kale over there next time.

143
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:35,120
Yeah, it's been a mixed bag this year, but peppers are coming soon.

144
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,400
Those are going to be great.

145
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,600
Oh, I just noticed. Yeah, the screw came out holding all the earth back.

146
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,200
Oops. About to reattach this or get a new door or something.

147
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:52,160
It's now August 1st and about 7 a.m., in fact, and check it out.

148
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,600
So these kale didn't really turn out. And to be honest, I don't like the taste of them,

149
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:03,000
so I probably won't buy them again. The regular kale is in the time for them to trim.

150
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,880
Cucumbers are doing very well. Look at that. They're growing up at the side of the deck there.

151
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,480
Tomatoes have gone completely insane.

152
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,360
Peppers. Check out the peppers, dude. I think there's actually some peppers already to be picked.

153
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,720
Let's see if I can... There's a couple there. Yeah.

154
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,120
There's some small ones coming in there.

155
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,120
Yeah, dude.

156
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,560
Look at that giant pepper. There's a fair amount of food here.

157
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:43,000
Basil needs a trim. And even though these peas are dying for some reason, I don't know why,

158
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,400
there's still a lot of peas on them. They're still popping up pods like this.

159
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,720
And these are delicious. I'll probably grab some for my salad tonight.

160
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,280
The lettuce didn't work out. It's all gone. There's a few lettuce remnants in there,

161
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,960
but they're just not going anywhere. We should probably pick this. It might be a bit too big.

162
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:07,200
Oops. I'll grab that right now. A couple of the cucumbers in there that are probably gonna

163
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,520
be worth picking in the next day or two. But yeah, things are going good for the most part.

164
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,280
There's been a few minor problems. I don't understand what's going on with the peas,

165
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:25,920
and some of the kale didn't work out. But it's soon pepper season, so I'll come back then,

166
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,960
so check out those peas there. Look how many there are. Awesome.

167
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,080
Can you see that? There's one tomato that's ready in there,

168
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,960
and there's some rather large cucumbers over there as well. Lettuce is all gone.

169
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:46,800
Kale seems to be doing okay. Probably ready for another harvest in the next couple days,

170
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:55,760
I think. Tomatoes are going absolutely insane. The peas are strange. They're dying.

171
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,440
They're still growing more pods. There's a whole bunch right here. Can you see this?

172
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:08,840
There's a whole bunch of pods in there. The roots are now springing up new shoots,

173
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,680
so I don't quite know what's going on. But I've been eating a lot of peas,

174
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,000
and they're still good, so that's good. You can see a ton of not yet ripe tomatoes.

175
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,920
They'll be coming along. This looks like a giant weed if we can pull it out.

176
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:35,920
I just... Oh, it broke off. Okay, there's that. Look at those guys. They're ready,

177
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,920
yeah? There's a curly one coming in, and then for this one over here. I can't really get

178
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:57,280
through the lattice. Okay, come on. There we go. Oh yeah. Excellent. And I'll probably

179
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,640
get that one tomato too. That's two big cucumbers. It's tomato time. I can't even get the snips in

180
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:21,200
there though. Can I just pull it off? Oops. I broke the branch. I guess we're getting too

181
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,240
small of tomatoes along with it. God damn it. There's also some peppers that are kind of ready

182
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:31,880
to go. I'm not going to pick them just yet. It's really warm right now. It's like 36 degrees

183
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:38,240
Celsius, and I don't need peppers yet. In a couple days I'll need some, so I'm going to let them grow

184
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,560
a little bit bigger before I start pulling them off. Yeah, there we go. Garden is mostly coming

185
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:53,800
along great this year. Look at that. So fast forward to early September, and a freak early

186
00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:01,120
frost has kind of destroyed the garden. Oops. The peas just died. I don't know what killed them,

187
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,200
but they're done. We got a lot of peas out of them though. Even as the vines were dying,

188
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,360
they were still producing some pretty good peas, so we actually had quite a few, but they're done.

189
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:17,280
Everything else is slowly on its way out. The kale, I've since harvested the rest of the kale

190
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,200
just to basically get the last few leaves that were edible out of there. They're done. We have

191
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,240
maybe 20 frozen bags of kale. I pulled all the peppers off because there's going to be another

192
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:34,400
frost tonight. There's a lot of peppers. I pulled off all the tomatoes. There's basically a sink

193
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,040
full of tomatoes in the kitchen right now, so we had a few tomatoes. They're all green, but they're

194
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:45,240
going to basically die if I leave them on there, so I decided to pull them off. There's actually

195
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:51,040
a number of cucumbers that are still growing, so I pulled off the ones that were sizable enough to

196
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:56,320
eat, and hopefully the small ones will survive and will give us a few more cucumbers in the next

197
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,800
week or two, but this is basically the end of the garden, I think. So this is it. Oh yeah,

198
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,880
the basil got way too much rain and has turned kind of yellow. Look at that. Look at all the

199
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,240
water in the pot there. It's been raining non-stop for the past couple weeks. I mean,

200
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,800
it makes watering easier. I don't got to water it. One cucumber I missed. I can probably grab

201
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:27,760
that one too, actually. Come on. There we go. That'd be the last one. And here's Naomi washing

202
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:36,480
the sink full of produce like the good and proper housewife she is. Yeah. Well,

203
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,920
I harvested it all. Why shouldn't you do this? It's your garden, Dad. You eat the tomatoes.

204
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:50,160
Your garden, Dad. You know what? Ah, get out of here. It's like September 9th. No,

205
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:57,240
it's September 10th today, and there is a frost warning tonight. Oh well. So it's early October.

206
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,520
Hopefully you can see the frost on the roof there. This is the first frost of the fall,

207
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:08,960
and here's what remains of the garden. It's pretty much dead. Now, I let the garden go

208
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,720
maybe about a month ago. I got the last harvest. We pulled everything off of it. I just left it

209
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,240
alone. However, I noticed even without watering it or whatever, it kept growing slowly. And you

210
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,920
can see, I think over there, like one cucumber that's not going to make it. It's really tiny

211
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:31,520
there. But it kept growing. And today was the first frost, so I came down here, and I basically

212
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,720
grabbed whatever was left. And what was left was there's going to be three or four good-sized

213
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,640
tomatoes that managed to grow in the cold, so good for them. There's a couple small peppers,

214
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:47,680
a whole bunch more kale. That just kept growing normally, so I guess that's cool. And then three

215
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:54,760
or four really tiny cucumbers. Not that tiny, but pickle-sized cucumbers. So for the last month,

216
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,520
the growing definitely slowed down. But I basically said, you know what? We'll just leave

217
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,040
everything up and see what comes out of it. And I got a little bit more food. I didn't have to put

218
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,480
any effort either. So I'll probably pull all this apart. I'm not getting anything else out of this

219
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:17,640
now. Not even dregs at this point. So I'll pull all this apart, and we will come back next year

220
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,680
and see what happens next year to this garden. It was pretty good this year. Wasn't as good as

221
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,280
last year. Last year was my best year ever, but this year was pretty good. Of course, the door

222
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,040
got broken by Naomi, but that's okay. We have another door that we're getting rid of anyway,

223
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,240
so I'll just shove it in there. Anyway, I hope your gardening excavates were just as fun as

224
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,280
mine this year. I'll see you guys later.
