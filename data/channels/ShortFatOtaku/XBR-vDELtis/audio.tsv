0	6800	Hey guys, Dev here. I've, uh, I've gardened at this location for about four or five years now, but I haven't really documented it.
6800	12640	So maybe, maybe I'll do that this year. So here we are. This is my gardening video. I guess I'm taking the idea from Styx.
12640	18200	I don't have quite as magnificent a garden as his though. Um, this is a very small location as you can see.
18200	25360	There's, there's our deck. There's our shed. We only had this little bit of land to do a garden with.
25360	30360	Before I moved in, there was like nothing there. It was just like weeds and a few stones. And I was like, you know what?
30360	35160	I'll, uh, I'll make a garden out of it, but why not? And I mean, I didn't have much money back then.
35160	42120	Um, so I used a door. As you can see, there is a door and it's kind of weathered at this point.
42120	47360	There's a door there. There's a door in the back as well for the back part.
47360	53400	And the rest is just made out of scrap wood that we had lying around. This is like a low income area.
53400	59160	So, uh, when we moved in, there was a lot of just scrap wood and random junk and garbage lying around.
59160	64040	And we cleaned the place up pretty nicely. But I, uh, I kept all the wood in case I ever wanted to do something like this one day.
64040	70240	And well, now I have. Anyway, it's late April. I just opened the garden up. There's just some leaves in there.
70240	76840	I've been digging around and just mixing things together. I'll probably have some plants to put in by, uh, by next week.
76840	82960	That's the plan anyway. So I'll come back next week. Oh yeah. Also those stones that I used for the little path, those were also scavenged.
82960	89080	There was just like, there was just like little bricks hanging around for some, I don't know why. I don't know.
89080	93760	A lot of this place doesn't really make much sense. Anyway, I'll see you when the plants get here.
93760	100560	And we've got the plants. Here we go. I've got kale, peppers, cucumber and tomatoes.
100560	107280	Those there are just herbs. And this is a celery butt that I've chopped.
107280	110760	And it's actually, I don't know if you can see it because of the sunlight, but it's actually starting to grow there.
110760	115640	Is it even a dish of water? And, uh, I'd say in a week's time I can probably put all these in.
115640	119800	So the plants are all in. It's been a week since you last saw them.
119800	125760	Um, some of them are a little bit wilted from being inside. I don't know if it's not enough water or not enough sun.
125760	131280	I did water them every day, but it doesn't matter. Hopefully they will survive out here.
131280	141560	So the garden is filled with eight kale, eight peppers, eight, um, tomatoes and 10 cucumbers,
141560	146880	as well as two celery butts that I chopped up and put in there.
146880	152280	You can get those two there. And along the edge here are some peas.
152280	160400	Now, what I've done is there was actually a bunch of, um, a bunch of scrap wood that wasn't being used.
160400	166080	Just lying around the property. So I gathered it up and I made a very ramshackle lattice.
166080	169520	I'm going to put some mesh in between these bits of lattice.
169520	175600	So that bit over there will hold all the cucumbers and they'll grow out probably onto the deck.
175600	183960	And then this bit here, I'll put a lattice there and that'll be where the peas go up, up to the top of the shed.
183960	188000	It's about a week later, guys, and I had to do some replanting.
188000	191840	A few of the plants died, in fact. It wasn't due to frosting or anything like that.
191840	199240	It's been above zero this whole time, but basically I got some of the seedlings from a, I'd say, a less than reputable source.
199240	204000	So I went out, got some more. I had to replant four cucumber. That's that row there.
204000	208720	Got a couple more kales. Got some red kale just to spice it up. Got some more peppers.
208720	213960	Garden update, guys. Here's the current state of my garden.
213960	222840	As it turns out, this is the end of May right now, and we had a freak hit of frost, potential frost.
222840	226120	And, you know, might not have been frost actually, but who knows?
226120	231880	My neighbor's garden is, in fact, covered up in much the same way.
231880	236480	So I had no way to actually cover the plants.
236480	241880	So we just put down garbage bags and other things and weighed them down.
241880	247880	I'm about to pull everything else off. Let's see if, let's see if stuff survived.
247880	251720	Let's move this aside.
254840	259200	Come on. Yeah, looks like the plant is just fine.
259200	264080	So I'll be pulling all this stuff off and we will get back to regular gardening.
264080	269000	This is now mid-June. Check it out, guys. Those peppers aren't going at all.
269000	274840	But I think peppers take some time. It's about time for the first harvesting of the kale.
274840	278840	Same with the lettuce. The peas are starting to climb. That's good.
278840	283080	There's a squirtle in there. Can you see him? Maybe he's gone now. Oh, well.
283080	288240	And the cucumbers still just kind of seem to be stunted. I hope things turn out.
288240	296840	It's now about the, what would it be, near the end of June. And this is the garden now.
296840	302000	The celery died. I have no idea why. I guess I can't do celery.
302000	306720	But peppers are going good. There's a lot of snap peas, man.
306720	310840	Tomatoes good. Cucumbers came back. Lots of lettuce. We've been eating the lettuce.
310840	315040	We've been eating the kale. Some pretty excellent. Here, let's see if I can get a snap pea, actually.
315040	319400	Yeah, check this guy out. Check this guy out.
319400	324600	Look at that. Hell yeah.
324600	330840	It's pretty good. All right, so it is about, I'd say, early July.
330840	336240	The pepper plants are all going great. We'll probably have peppers soon. Look at those pepper flowers, man.
336240	341720	Yeah. I'm out here primarily to harvest the kale. There is so much kale, man.
341720	345080	Look at that. That one little kale in the corner didn't really go anywhere.
345080	349360	But the rest of it's going good. You see back there, cucumbers.
349360	354840	There's some cucumbers in there I got to pick, but the cucumbers are growing up the lattice quite nicely.
354840	358480	That is a lettuce that I failed to harvest. I completely forgot about it.
358480	363200	And that's just a ton of seeds. But the actual leaves are still good.
363200	368640	There's the tomatoes. Tomatoes are really overgrowing. Basically everything is kind of growing like crazy.
368640	375280	Look at it. Look at it. Wow. That's a lot of food, but still.
375280	378200	There's the peas. I've been eating a lot of the snap peas.
378200	381640	You can see there's actually one right there. In fact, it's ready to go.
381640	386560	But something I've noticed. How come some of the snap pea leaves are turning white at the bottom?
386560	390640	What's the deal there? But in any case, though, the snap peas are generally doing fine.
390640	394640	I'm probably going to be harvesting right now. In fact, basil needs to be cut.
394640	399720	There's a basil plant there. That's spicy basil. And this is just regular basil.
399720	405360	They both need to be cut. So I'm going to do that right now. Ah, geez, I'm sweating everywhere.
405400	413520	So here's the haul. There's three cucumbers. There was actually four, but my dad grabbed one when he came over to visit earlier this morning.
413520	420880	There's a baggie full of basil. There's three baggies, three very big baggies full of kale that we put in my freezer.
420880	425120	I generally use it for smoothies and stuff, so I just freeze it and put it in a smoothie when I'm done.
425120	431800	And there is a very big lettuce plant that I let go to seed, mainly out of laziness.
431800	435800	Oops. But all those leaves down at the bottom are still good. So I'll be having salad tonight.
435800	442880	Um, here's the look of the garden now that all the kale plants have been have been cut.
442880	449840	And they'll they'll just keep growing. You can kind of see this one here. That that's like three harvests worth of trimming.
449840	452800	It'll just bloom out at the top again and I'll trim it again.
452800	457440	And these things will get to be a couple of feet high by the end of the year with all the various trimmings.
457440	461480	I just noticed there's a there's a big tomato right there. That's that's coming along nicely.
461480	464840	But I don't quite understand is why some of the lettuce regrew and some of it didn't.
464840	471280	So, for example, see if we can see this. Can I show you properly?
471280	480200	This is the lettuce stump that I just cut. OK, this down here is the lettuce stump that I cut like two weeks ago.
480200	483960	And there's a bunch of new growth coming out of it. So new lettuce is growing out of the stump.
483960	489120	I cut this stump in the same way and it's not growing at all. I think it just died.
489120	492880	I don't quite know the difference as to why sometimes lettuce comes back and sometimes it doesn't.
492880	497680	I left a few bottom leaves on this stump in the hope that the leaves will help it grow back.
497680	503360	So I'll get more lettuce because I would rather these lettuce these lettuce plants that I bought not be one and done.
503360	508320	But who knows? Oh, yeah. I also did harvest some some snap peas, but I ate them all.
508320	512680	There's a bunch of small ones here at the top. You can see that there's a whole bunch of small ones at the top.
512680	516120	I'm just I'm just waiting for those for a couple of days for them to be bigger.
516120	519680	I like them generally bigger than this. This is this is a good size.
519680	526080	I'm going to grab that right now in fact. Yeah. That's delicious, man.
526080	530360	And I should probably point out gardening is not hard, but it's also not easy.
530360	534800	But there are people who are like, I can't garden. I can't do it. Actually, Sargon said this once that he didn't know what to do about gardening.
534800	538440	Well, I mean, I'm not I'm not like as pro as Stixxenhammer or something.
538440	543080	I do end up getting store-bought plants. And once the gardens filled in, I just basically dug holes,
543080	547160	put a little bit of a sheep manure in the bottom, just a handful and put the plant in.
547160	555280	And here you go. Water every day, every morning, and you're set like it takes some work initially, but now it's just kind of going on its own.
555280	559160	I just got to basically remember to water as part of my morning routine. So it's not that hard.
559160	563480	Sargon, if you ever actually end up listening to this video, I I know you have a yard.
563480	570720	I recommend you trying it out and everyone else, too. If you have a spot where you can garden, I actually definitely I definitely recommend giving it a try.
570720	575360	So as you can see, I've picked off all the usable leaves from that lettuce and put them in a bowl.
575360	582080	I'm going to put it in the fridge. So the plan is get yourself a piece of paper towel.
582080	586880	Add water to it. Drench it in water. You drench it in water. You can hear me.
586880	596760	Don't rip it, though. Just make sure it's like completely soaked and you like lay it on top of the bowl of lettuce like so.
596800	602960	There you go. And that will keep the lettuce moist and relatively crunchy for several days.
602960	608480	Now, because I did wait until it was a giant stock and I didn't harvest it earlier, this lettuce will be a little bit bitter, but it's still good to eat.
608480	612600	It'll just it'll just be a little bit better than normal, but that's fine. It's not a big deal.
612600	619600	It is now late July and look at it. Look at it, guys. The the basil.
619600	624480	I put another trim. I've been cutting the kale recently.
624480	632000	However, this type of kale here didn't really do so well. These traditional plants are doing great, though.
632000	637200	Check out the peppers growing. Look at that. Yeah, man.
637200	641560	Peppers growing on the pepper plants. They're coming in everywhere.
641560	648640	Look. Yeah, man. The peas aren't doing so well.
648680	652440	And frankly, I don't know why I've been watering them.
652440	657400	I've been weeding around them, but they're all just turning yellow.
657400	662040	They're still growing peas, but I don't know quite what to do about it.
662040	666640	You know, tomatoes are going crazy.
666640	670640	There's a bunch of tomatoes in there so you can reach one. Can you see that in there?
670640	674600	Yes. They'll be coming along in a few weeks. The lettuce just gave up.
674600	680280	That's done. You can see that stump there regrowing, but it's not going to take off.
680280	685680	I got to do something different with the lettuce next year. And here's the cucumber patch.
685680	690040	Look at this. That's almost ready to eat, isn't it?
690040	691960	Maybe another day or two just to get a little bit thicker.
691960	698240	But, yeah, the cucumbers are winding their way up properly.
698240	701040	Actually, maybe I'll adjust this one right here. I want it.
701040	704960	Don't grab onto the lettuce plant or the tomato plant.
704960	710360	Come on. Off. Off. Let go.
710360	718320	Yeah, I'm going to try to get them to grow this way so they'll climb up this trellis here.
718320	724480	Yeah, you see those cucumbers in there? Yeah, it's doing great.
724480	726360	It's doing pretty good.
726360	730800	I think what I'll change next year, though, is I have a planter that I'll put the lettuce in.
730800	733880	And I'll put seeds down so it kind of grows like grass.
733880	738280	I can just snip it rather than have to deal with full hearts.
738280	743160	Probably more cucumbers in this corner. This stuff will all be the same.
743160	749840	And maybe I'll go for the traditional kale over there next time.
749840	755120	Yeah, it's been a mixed bag this year, but peppers are coming soon.
755120	757400	Those are going to be great.
757400	762600	Oh, I just noticed. Yeah, the screw came out holding all the earth back.
762600	766200	Oops. About to reattach this or get a new door or something.
766200	772160	It's now August 1st and about 7 a.m., in fact, and check it out.
772160	776600	So these kale didn't really turn out. And to be honest, I don't like the taste of them,
776600	783000	so I probably won't buy them again. The regular kale is in the time for them to trim.
783000	789880	Cucumbers are doing very well. Look at that. They're growing up at the side of the deck there.
789880	793480	Tomatoes have gone completely insane.
793480	797360	Peppers. Check out the peppers, dude. I think there's actually some peppers already to be picked.
797360	801720	Let's see if I can... There's a couple there. Yeah.
801720	805120	There's some small ones coming in there.
808400	811120	Yeah, dude.
811120	815560	Look at that giant pepper. There's a fair amount of food here.
815560	823000	Basil needs a trim. And even though these peas are dying for some reason, I don't know why,
823000	827400	there's still a lot of peas on them. They're still popping up pods like this.
827400	831720	And these are delicious. I'll probably grab some for my salad tonight.
831720	836280	The lettuce didn't work out. It's all gone. There's a few lettuce remnants in there,
836280	841960	but they're just not going anywhere. We should probably pick this. It might be a bit too big.
841960	847200	Oops. I'll grab that right now. A couple of the cucumbers in there that are probably gonna
847200	852520	be worth picking in the next day or two. But yeah, things are going good for the most part.
852520	858280	There's been a few minor problems. I don't understand what's going on with the peas,
858280	865920	and some of the kale didn't work out. But it's soon pepper season, so I'll come back then,
866280	870960	so check out those peas there. Look how many there are. Awesome.
870960	874080	Can you see that? There's one tomato that's ready in there,
874080	879960	and there's some rather large cucumbers over there as well. Lettuce is all gone.
879960	886800	Kale seems to be doing okay. Probably ready for another harvest in the next couple days,
886800	895760	I think. Tomatoes are going absolutely insane. The peas are strange. They're dying.
896720	900440	They're still growing more pods. There's a whole bunch right here. Can you see this?
900440	908840	There's a whole bunch of pods in there. The roots are now springing up new shoots,
908840	913680	so I don't quite know what's going on. But I've been eating a lot of peas,
913680	919000	and they're still good, so that's good. You can see a ton of not yet ripe tomatoes.
919000	923920	They'll be coming along. This looks like a giant weed if we can pull it out.
923920	935920	I just... Oh, it broke off. Okay, there's that. Look at those guys. They're ready,
935920	942920	yeah? There's a curly one coming in, and then for this one over here. I can't really get
942920	957280	through the lattice. Okay, come on. There we go. Oh yeah. Excellent. And I'll probably
957280	963640	get that one tomato too. That's two big cucumbers. It's tomato time. I can't even get the snips in
963640	981200	there though. Can I just pull it off? Oops. I broke the branch. I guess we're getting too
981200	985240	small of tomatoes along with it. God damn it. There's also some peppers that are kind of ready
985240	991880	to go. I'm not going to pick them just yet. It's really warm right now. It's like 36 degrees
991920	998240	Celsius, and I don't need peppers yet. In a couple days I'll need some, so I'm going to let them grow
998240	1004560	a little bit bigger before I start pulling them off. Yeah, there we go. Garden is mostly coming
1004560	1013800	along great this year. Look at that. So fast forward to early September, and a freak early
1013800	1021120	frost has kind of destroyed the garden. Oops. The peas just died. I don't know what killed them,
1021120	1025200	but they're done. We got a lot of peas out of them though. Even as the vines were dying,
1025200	1030360	they were still producing some pretty good peas, so we actually had quite a few, but they're done.
1030360	1037280	Everything else is slowly on its way out. The kale, I've since harvested the rest of the kale
1037280	1042200	just to basically get the last few leaves that were edible out of there. They're done. We have
1042200	1047240	maybe 20 frozen bags of kale. I pulled all the peppers off because there's going to be another
1047240	1054400	frost tonight. There's a lot of peppers. I pulled off all the tomatoes. There's basically a sink
1054400	1060040	full of tomatoes in the kitchen right now, so we had a few tomatoes. They're all green, but they're
1060040	1065240	going to basically die if I leave them on there, so I decided to pull them off. There's actually
1065240	1071040	a number of cucumbers that are still growing, so I pulled off the ones that were sizable enough to
1071040	1076320	eat, and hopefully the small ones will survive and will give us a few more cucumbers in the next
1076320	1080800	week or two, but this is basically the end of the garden, I think. So this is it. Oh yeah,
1080800	1086880	the basil got way too much rain and has turned kind of yellow. Look at that. Look at all the
1086880	1092240	water in the pot there. It's been raining non-stop for the past couple weeks. I mean,
1092240	1096800	it makes watering easier. I don't got to water it. One cucumber I missed. I can probably grab
1096800	1107760	that one too, actually. Come on. There we go. That'd be the last one. And here's Naomi washing
1107760	1116480	the sink full of produce like the good and proper housewife she is. Yeah. Well,
1116480	1122920	I harvested it all. Why shouldn't you do this? It's your garden, Dad. You eat the tomatoes.
1122920	1130160	Your garden, Dad. You know what? Ah, get out of here. It's like September 9th. No,
1130160	1137240	it's September 10th today, and there is a frost warning tonight. Oh well. So it's early October.
1137240	1142520	Hopefully you can see the frost on the roof there. This is the first frost of the fall,
1142520	1148960	and here's what remains of the garden. It's pretty much dead. Now, I let the garden go
1149640	1154720	maybe about a month ago. I got the last harvest. We pulled everything off of it. I just left it
1154720	1161240	alone. However, I noticed even without watering it or whatever, it kept growing slowly. And you
1161240	1164920	can see, I think over there, like one cucumber that's not going to make it. It's really tiny
1164920	1171520	there. But it kept growing. And today was the first frost, so I came down here, and I basically
1171520	1175720	grabbed whatever was left. And what was left was there's going to be three or four good-sized
1175760	1180640	tomatoes that managed to grow in the cold, so good for them. There's a couple small peppers,
1180640	1187680	a whole bunch more kale. That just kept growing normally, so I guess that's cool. And then three
1187680	1194760	or four really tiny cucumbers. Not that tiny, but pickle-sized cucumbers. So for the last month,
1194760	1199520	the growing definitely slowed down. But I basically said, you know what? We'll just leave
1199520	1204040	everything up and see what comes out of it. And I got a little bit more food. I didn't have to put
1204280	1210480	any effort either. So I'll probably pull all this apart. I'm not getting anything else out of this
1210480	1217640	now. Not even dregs at this point. So I'll pull all this apart, and we will come back next year
1217640	1221680	and see what happens next year to this garden. It was pretty good this year. Wasn't as good as
1221680	1227280	last year. Last year was my best year ever, but this year was pretty good. Of course, the door
1227280	1232040	got broken by Naomi, but that's okay. We have another door that we're getting rid of anyway,
1232040	1236240	so I'll just shove it in there. Anyway, I hope your gardening excavates were just as fun as
1236240	1238280	mine this year. I'll see you guys later.
