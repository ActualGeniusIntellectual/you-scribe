0	10220	Once again, friends, it's TikTok Tuesday time.
10220	13420	Some people said that I should actually get like a different background or maybe different
13420	18900	music to differentiate TikTok Tuesday from the 10-minute takes videos, now that it is
18900	20260	kind of becoming its own thing.
20260	24160	I probably will eventually, I just got to shake the tree of the guy who does my animated
24160	25160	backgrounds.
25160	28760	Then again, fat dev at the computer table with a phone, that kind of fits, doesn't it?
28760	29760	I don't know.
29760	30760	I don't know.
30760	34760	But you guys have sent me a handful of more videos, so let's begin.
34760	37760	They are writing another ticket, I think number 15.
37760	38760	15 tickets?
38760	43760	We're handing out food to those who don't have the chance to get it easily.
43760	44760	Whoa, what?
44760	45760	There.
45760	46760	Wait, hold on.
46760	47760	I got to watch that again.
47760	48760	They are writing another ticket.
48760	50160	Tickets for handing out food?
50160	51160	We're handing out food.
51160	52160	Yeah.
52160	53160	To those who don't.
53160	54160	To the homeless, I guess.
54160	55160	To get it easily.
55160	56440	Is that really a thing?
56440	57880	You can't hand out food to the homeless?
57880	59200	They're still getting ticketed?
59200	60960	Maybe it's because they're not an official charity.
60960	66300	Maybe it's because the food hasn't been checked by some sort of authority or secured or something,
66300	69240	so maybe it's full of poison, who the fuck knows, right?
69240	71000	It's possible.
71000	76400	Maybe you have to actually be working with some sort of certified aid organization to
76400	77740	be able to do this legally.
77740	78920	That's possible, I guess.
78920	82960	It's kind of funny to listen to commies scream about, mutual aid, mutual aid, let us help
82960	87160	our poor unhoused neighbors, and then complaining when they get ticketed without doing it with
87160	92160	some sort of accreditation, when in other areas of life, they clearly understand the
92160	93860	need for accreditation.
93860	95560	Everything can't simply be anarchy.
95560	98600	I put a microchip in my arm, and it's the best thing ever.
98600	99600	What?
99600	100600	This chip is a powerhouse.
100600	101600	It's got everything I need.
101600	102600	My credit card, my ID, my phone, even my keys.
102600	103600	Oh, this sounds unsafe.
103600	104600	And when it's time for grief, she's through it, and bam, transaction done.
104600	105600	It's like magic.
105600	106600	It's a medical emergency.
106600	107600	It can save my life.
107600	108600	The future is now, old man.
108600	109600	It's a medical history.
109600	110600	I feel like a sci-fi kid.
110600	111600	And I'm loving it.
111600	112600	This amazing chip is totally free.
112600	113600	That's right.
113600	114600	Oh, don't trust the Australian government with this chip.
114600	115600	The surgery is quick.
115600	116600	It will give you a cookie afterward.
116600	117600	The government has frozen my bank account, and it can freeze your chip.
117600	118600	So you have to listen to my story.
118600	119600	Oh God.
119600	120600	Let's hear it.
120600	121600	A few days ago, I made a post on social media about a danger of having a chip implanted
121600	122600	in my arm.
122600	123600	I thought I was exercising my right to freeze my arm.
123600	129060	I thought it was that it was a
129060	133500	Hahaha, oh god. Let's hear it
138700	140700	Yeah, oh
144420	151260	Oh, no, oh your Starbucks doesn't get your Starbucks anymore
159780	161780	Oh
161780	164300	Oh, no, darlin, I
165740	167540	Remember back
167540	173840	Jesus I think was the I think was during gamergate times when Zoe Quinn was going around saying she was the first
174100	181220	Cyborg because she implanted like a magnet underneath one of her fingertips so she could do like certain magnet jobs, right?
181220	186860	You know if you like a piece of if a tiny screw falls like deep into a tiny crevice inside of a computer
186860	189300	You're working on you got to get like a little magnet thing to fish it out
189300	192540	You have a magnet in the tip of your finger. You just reach in there poke it. Oh, you got it
192540	197260	You got it. Nice. Okay, what she also did was she put an NFC chip inside of her hand
197260	199340	I think the FCS are the same thing used in
199980	207220	Nintendo's amiibos the idea is that they can store very tiny amounts of information and even back then I was always thinking man if you're
207220	211020	Storing like sensitive information on this something can always go wrong
211020	214660	There are people who can scan cards by like running a device over your wallet or something
214660	219360	That's what the whole Ridge wallet thing is is supposed to block by the way not sponsored by Ridge wallet
219360	220220	But I do like their wallets
220220	221700	So if you want to give me some money Ridge wallet
221700	226260	But the point is is it the the the the I think they call them RFID blocking plates
226260	232740	You could have someone run a machine over your your wall or over your pocket as they walk by you
233220	237580	Scan information off the chip on your credit card and then use that to spoof the credit card
237620	243140	There's lots of ways to just scan people and get information from the stuff in there in their pockets nowadays
243140	249640	And so I always thought if you have a chip underneath your your finger or your arm or your hand yeah
249640	254420	It's convenient, and it's kind of cool to just like scan your hand and like a futuristic cyberpunk II kind of way
254420	255820	But man, that's dangerous
255820	261780	Criminals can just get your shit, and now as you've seen with this woman governments can just can just fuck you up
261780	264740	Oh, everything's on a chip. They can just lock you out if you have wrong think on the internet

460820	463100	I'm a girl. I'm a harmless. Oh, it's like what the fuck?
463100	469060	No, in fact one of the comments underneath this was like, yeah, he overreacted you didn't have to embarrass her like that
469620	474880	What are you fucking kidding me reverse the sexes on this and see if you'd say that shit
474880	479560	You got some let's say you had Belle up there and a guy starts grabbing her tits. Like what the fuck is wrong with you?

483900	489740	I wouldn't have done what she did but come on lol. These people actually think that women can't sexually assault men
489780	495660	It's pretty fucking disgusting. Oh shit. The drive-thru order is no good. Oh, no her car
500300	503860	Oh my god, oh the tree
510180	511620	Oh
511620	514700	My god, is she rolling out into traffic?
515700	518980	Sometimes McDonald's workers might put the wrong burger in your in your bag
518980	524020	But lady, you know, you're gonna step out of the car and freak out then it rolls away like oh my god
524020	524400	No
524400	528820	Now that Naomi and I actually have our own vehicle and we're driving around the city and we're doing stuff the more that I see
528820	530120	these car
530120	534620	Videos the more that I'm like, I'm still laughing at them. Like they're just oh, you're stupid
534620	539460	Haha, like I used to but now I'm like seeing how could you be that dumb?
539460	544340	How could you be that negligent considering how much stuff you have to like know and learn
544600	549260	To own and drive a car and what it's like to actually be behind the the driver's wheel
549260	554620	How could you how could you forget the important things to freak out about a burger? I don't I don't get it, dude
554620	558620	Hey, so you've come to my house to complain about my baby wearing pink
558620	564660	Well, I'm just asking really why you keep putting her in pink and not other colors. Well, traditionally girls often wear pink
564660	569160	It's not your baby lady. Well, I think you'll find that was back in the day. I don't think it's today
569160	571920	I think you can wear any color you want now. It's a fucking baby
571920	578780	It's even your baby yet. Just she doesn't just she actually she has over like clothes as well, but her favorite color is pink
579400	583280	Yeah in pink, and I think that's this fucking busybody dude
583680	585680	What do you mean freedom wants to be?
586560	588480	She's a baby
588480	590480	She's baby. She's two
591480	595200	Oh my god, well many of what's any of your concern?
595880	601920	Business lady because I believe that the world has got better since we've got all this fluidity with genders
602640	604640	Christ
605880	611680	Imagine the local Karen coming over to police what you put your kid in
615600	621400	So I think it's nicer to dress people in all different colors, I mean she looked beautiful in yellow wouldn't she
625200	632480	She was sorry, she's got pink trousers on. Oh my god. I do like the rainbow. I definitely like the rainbows on
632480	634480	Like what the fuck is this lady's problem?
634560	637880	Okay. Okay. Firstly. Yeah, you're wearing pink glasses
641520	643520	Oh
645400	647400	My god
648320	653280	Yeah, she says pink, but they're not they are mode mode mode glasses
653440	655440	Okay
666720	672200	I'm actually stunned here to like why you're actually here. She just comes up to their place
672200	677360	It's like why you keep dressed him going in pink. I think you should give her more choices of color. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, but
678200	682500	She's however, I want to dress her. Okay. Yeah, the way how I parent it is
683280	685280	With you, that's true
685720	690520	Feel the people these days and I think they should have more choices of what colors they want to wear
690520	695780	This lady is a book club or something. Fuck. I don't need to teach her about all this my god
696320	700320	Like you can tell were those those weren't Austrian. Those are bonger accents, right?
700320	701800	This is a Brit bong thing, man
701800	707920	Imagine living in some British suburb and the local Karen comes up to you and complains that you put your daughter in pink clothes
707920	708520	You know what?
708520	714720	I think I finally understand why Sargon swung to the right wing because you wouldn't ever see this shit here in Canada
714720	717000	Yeah, there's some weird shit happening with their government
717000	722760	That's for sure. But like a random Karen coming up and complaining that your daughter's dressed in pink clothes. No fucking way
722760	729840	No, wait, no shot as the zoomers say. Alright buddies. That's another tik-tok Tuesday clipped and shipped
729840	737080	I know combined with yesterday's video in today's this was not exactly the most highbrow content that I've put out but don't worry
737080	743120	We're coming back tomorrow with some good shit. I will see you guys there. Have a good one. I love you
