00:00.000 --> 00:10.220
Once again, friends, it's TikTok Tuesday time.

00:10.220 --> 00:13.420
Some people said that I should actually get like a different background or maybe different

00:13.420 --> 00:18.900
music to differentiate TikTok Tuesday from the 10-minute takes videos, now that it is

00:18.900 --> 00:20.260
kind of becoming its own thing.

00:20.260 --> 00:24.160
I probably will eventually, I just got to shake the tree of the guy who does my animated

00:24.160 --> 00:25.160
backgrounds.

00:25.160 --> 00:28.760
Then again, fat dev at the computer table with a phone, that kind of fits, doesn't it?

00:28.760 --> 00:29.760
I don't know.

00:29.760 --> 00:30.760
I don't know.

00:30.760 --> 00:34.760
But you guys have sent me a handful of more videos, so let's begin.

00:34.760 --> 00:37.760
They are writing another ticket, I think number 15.

00:37.760 --> 00:38.760
15 tickets?

00:38.760 --> 00:43.760
We're handing out food to those who don't have the chance to get it easily.

00:43.760 --> 00:44.760
Whoa, what?

00:44.760 --> 00:45.760
There.

00:45.760 --> 00:46.760
Wait, hold on.

00:46.760 --> 00:47.760
I got to watch that again.

00:47.760 --> 00:48.760
They are writing another ticket.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.160
Tickets for handing out food?

00:50.160 --> 00:51.160
We're handing out food.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.160
Yeah.

00:52.160 --> 00:53.160
To those who don't.

00:53.160 --> 00:54.160
To the homeless, I guess.

00:54.160 --> 00:55.160
To get it easily.

00:55.160 --> 00:56.440
Is that really a thing?

00:56.440 --> 00:57.880
You can't hand out food to the homeless?

00:57.880 --> 00:59.200
They're still getting ticketed?

00:59.200 --> 01:00.960
Maybe it's because they're not an official charity.

01:00.960 --> 01:06.300
Maybe it's because the food hasn't been checked by some sort of authority or secured or something,

01:06.300 --> 01:09.240
so maybe it's full of poison, who the fuck knows, right?

01:09.240 --> 01:11.000
It's possible.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.400
Maybe you have to actually be working with some sort of certified aid organization to

01:16.400 --> 01:17.740
be able to do this legally.

01:17.740 --> 01:18.920
That's possible, I guess.

01:18.920 --> 01:22.960
It's kind of funny to listen to commies scream about, mutual aid, mutual aid, let us help

01:22.960 --> 01:27.160
our poor unhoused neighbors, and then complaining when they get ticketed without doing it with

01:27.160 --> 01:32.160
some sort of accreditation, when in other areas of life, they clearly understand the

01:32.160 --> 01:33.860
need for accreditation.

01:33.860 --> 01:35.560
Everything can't simply be anarchy.

01:35.560 --> 01:38.600
I put a microchip in my arm, and it's the best thing ever.

01:38.600 --> 01:39.600
What?

01:39.600 --> 01:40.600
This chip is a powerhouse.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.600
It's got everything I need.

01:41.600 --> 01:42.600
My credit card, my ID, my phone, even my keys.

01:42.600 --> 01:43.600
Oh, this sounds unsafe.

01:43.600 --> 01:44.600
And when it's time for grief, she's through it, and bam, transaction done.

01:44.600 --> 01:45.600
It's like magic.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.600
It's a medical emergency.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.600
It can save my life.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.600
The future is now, old man.

01:48.600 --> 01:49.600
It's a medical history.

01:49.600 --> 01:50.600
I feel like a sci-fi kid.

01:50.600 --> 01:51.600
And I'm loving it.

01:51.600 --> 01:52.600
This amazing chip is totally free.

01:52.600 --> 01:53.600
That's right.

01:53.600 --> 01:54.600
Oh, don't trust the Australian government with this chip.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.600
The surgery is quick.

01:55.600 --> 01:56.600
It will give you a cookie afterward.

01:56.600 --> 01:57.600
The government has frozen my bank account, and it can freeze your chip.

01:57.600 --> 01:58.600
So you have to listen to my story.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.600
Oh God.

01:59.600 --> 02:00.600
Let's hear it.

02:00.600 --> 02:01.600
A few days ago, I made a post on social media about a danger of having a chip implanted

02:01.600 --> 02:02.600
in my arm.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.600
I thought I was exercising my right to freeze my arm.

02:03.600 --> 02:09.060
I thought it was that it was a

02:09.060 --> 02:13.500
Hahaha, oh god. Let's hear it

02:18.700 --> 02:20.700
Yeah, oh

02:24.420 --> 02:31.260
Oh, no, oh your Starbucks doesn't get your Starbucks anymore

02:39.780 --> 02:41.780
Oh

02:41.780 --> 02:44.300
Oh, no, darlin, I

02:45.740 --> 02:47.540
Remember back

02:47.540 --> 02:53.840
Jesus I think was the I think was during gamergate times when Zoe Quinn was going around saying she was the first

02:54.100 --> 03:01.220
Cyborg because she implanted like a magnet underneath one of her fingertips so she could do like certain magnet jobs, right?

03:01.220 --> 03:06.860
You know if you like a piece of if a tiny screw falls like deep into a tiny crevice inside of a computer

03:06.860 --> 03:09.300
You're working on you got to get like a little magnet thing to fish it out

03:09.300 --> 03:12.540
You have a magnet in the tip of your finger. You just reach in there poke it. Oh, you got it

03:12.540 --> 03:17.260
You got it. Nice. Okay, what she also did was she put an NFC chip inside of her hand

03:17.260 --> 03:19.340
I think the FCS are the same thing used in

03:19.980 --> 03:27.220
Nintendo's amiibos the idea is that they can store very tiny amounts of information and even back then I was always thinking man if you're

03:27.220 --> 03:31.020
Storing like sensitive information on this something can always go wrong

03:31.020 --> 03:34.660
There are people who can scan cards by like running a device over your wallet or something

03:34.660 --> 03:39.360
That's what the whole Ridge wallet thing is is supposed to block by the way not sponsored by Ridge wallet

03:39.360 --> 03:40.220
But I do like their wallets

03:40.220 --> 03:41.700
So if you want to give me some money Ridge wallet

03:41.700 --> 03:46.260
But the point is is it the the the the I think they call them RFID blocking plates

03:46.260 --> 03:52.740
You could have someone run a machine over your your wall or over your pocket as they walk by you

03:53.220 --> 03:57.580
Scan information off the chip on your credit card and then use that to spoof the credit card

03:57.620 --> 04:03.140
There's lots of ways to just scan people and get information from the stuff in there in their pockets nowadays

04:03.140 --> 04:09.640
And so I always thought if you have a chip underneath your your finger or your arm or your hand yeah

04:09.640 --> 04:14.420
It's convenient, and it's kind of cool to just like scan your hand and like a futuristic cyberpunk II kind of way

04:14.420 --> 04:15.820
But man, that's dangerous

04:15.820 --> 04:21.780
Criminals can just get your shit, and now as you've seen with this woman governments can just can just fuck you up

04:21.780 --> 04:24.740
Oh, everything's on a chip. They can just lock you out if you have wrong think on the internet

04:24.740 --> 04:30.920
She just told the police where they are hiding on live TV. Oh, no. Oh, oh my but

04:30.920 --> 04:35.080
I just came out here to clear his name cuz I just I want him to go to jail and nothing like that

04:35.080 --> 04:38.040
And I know they looking for him. They're not gonna find them. He at my mama house

04:40.720 --> 04:46.600
Chilling they're just chillin no they waiting for me to pick them up right now, but I'm about to leave is this life

04:46.600 --> 04:48.600
Oh, is it? Oh?

05:14.160 --> 05:16.160
Nice music

05:17.080 --> 05:19.140
Thanks for shopping as you just take everything

05:19.140 --> 05:21.140
Wow

05:23.140 --> 05:29.820
They're just walking out I keep finding videos every week that I do one of these tick-tock videos someone sends me a clip of

05:30.140 --> 05:35.780
People just walking out of stores with arms arms full of stuff like no one gives a fuck

05:35.780 --> 05:37.620
I I've been sitting on a on a book

05:37.620 --> 05:42.900
It's a small book, but it's a leftist political theory book called in defense of looting

05:42.900 --> 05:48.980
I've been sitting on that book for a while and now that the whole shoplifting craze is kind of going wild on social

05:48.980 --> 05:54.020
Media, I should probably finally do that video too. This one's soundless. I think so just talk through it

05:54.020 --> 05:58.460
Why the fuck's my hairline already receding? I'm only 17. Oh, dude, that sucks

05:58.460 --> 06:04.900
Like that's my hairline now, and I'm in my 30s. He's 17. Fuck that sucks. You trying to trade homie?

06:05.420 --> 06:09.620
Let's see. Let's see what this kid's got. I think how they're all growing their hair long to hide it. Oh

06:10.460 --> 06:12.460

06:13.380 --> 06:15.520
Yeah, you got to grow that hair long to hide it man

06:16.500 --> 06:22.400
It can't get worse than this. Let's see that all all these bros are feeling it together. Oh

06:25.840 --> 06:27.840
God oh, dude

06:29.240 --> 06:31.240
We're all in it together

06:31.800 --> 06:33.800
Let's see

06:34.320 --> 06:36.320
Here's a twink kid. Oh

06:38.560 --> 06:41.560
No, dude twink death is real. Oh my god

07:06.440 --> 07:11.340
I'm sorry guys, like like I've still got most of my hair and I'm thankful for it

07:11.420 --> 07:13.620
My hairline is definitely receding over the years

07:13.620 --> 07:16.980
I can tell you can go back and watch a video of me from ten years ago. Definitely

07:16.980 --> 07:21.200
Oh God girl harasses Gaston and he rightfully forces her to leave

07:22.980 --> 07:24.980
Don't just touch him lady geez

07:26.380 --> 07:28.380
Yeah, he's like get out oh

07:29.100 --> 07:31.100
He's not joking get the fuck out

07:34.500 --> 07:40.820
She's like, yep, you're done fuck you dude like that's just sexual assault and she's laughing like oh, it's completely fine

07:40.820 --> 07:43.100
I'm a girl. I'm a harmless. Oh, it's like what the fuck?

07:43.100 --> 07:49.060
No, in fact one of the comments underneath this was like, yeah, he overreacted you didn't have to embarrass her like that

07:49.620 --> 07:54.880
What are you fucking kidding me reverse the sexes on this and see if you'd say that shit

07:54.880 --> 07:59.560
You got some let's say you had Belle up there and a guy starts grabbing her tits. Like what the fuck is wrong with you?

07:59.560 --> 08:03.900
It's a performance. There's kids there. Like are you are you fucking retarded? I just see him being a jerk

08:03.900 --> 08:09.740
I wouldn't have done what she did but come on lol. These people actually think that women can't sexually assault men

08:09.780 --> 08:15.660
It's pretty fucking disgusting. Oh shit. The drive-thru order is no good. Oh, no her car

08:20.300 --> 08:23.860
Oh my god, oh the tree

08:30.180 --> 08:31.620
Oh

08:31.620 --> 08:34.700
My god, is she rolling out into traffic?

08:35.700 --> 08:38.980
Sometimes McDonald's workers might put the wrong burger in your in your bag

08:38.980 --> 08:44.020
But lady, you know, you're gonna step out of the car and freak out then it rolls away like oh my god

08:44.020 --> 08:44.400
No

08:44.400 --> 08:48.820
Now that Naomi and I actually have our own vehicle and we're driving around the city and we're doing stuff the more that I see

08:48.820 --> 08:50.120
these car

08:50.120 --> 08:54.620
Videos the more that I'm like, I'm still laughing at them. Like they're just oh, you're stupid

08:54.620 --> 08:59.460
Haha, like I used to but now I'm like seeing how could you be that dumb?

08:59.460 --> 09:04.340
How could you be that negligent considering how much stuff you have to like know and learn

09:04.600 --> 09:09.260
To own and drive a car and what it's like to actually be behind the the driver's wheel

09:09.260 --> 09:14.620
How could you how could you forget the important things to freak out about a burger? I don't I don't get it, dude

09:14.620 --> 09:18.620
Hey, so you've come to my house to complain about my baby wearing pink

09:18.620 --> 09:24.660
Well, I'm just asking really why you keep putting her in pink and not other colors. Well, traditionally girls often wear pink

09:24.660 --> 09:29.160
It's not your baby lady. Well, I think you'll find that was back in the day. I don't think it's today

09:29.160 --> 09:31.920
I think you can wear any color you want now. It's a fucking baby

09:31.920 --> 09:38.780
It's even your baby yet. Just she doesn't just she actually she has over like clothes as well, but her favorite color is pink

09:39.400 --> 09:43.280
Yeah in pink, and I think that's this fucking busybody dude

09:43.680 --> 09:45.680
What do you mean freedom wants to be?

09:46.560 --> 09:48.480
She's a baby

09:48.480 --> 09:50.480
She's baby. She's two

09:51.480 --> 09:55.200
Oh my god, well many of what's any of your concern?

09:55.880 --> 10:01.920
Business lady because I believe that the world has got better since we've got all this fluidity with genders

10:02.640 --> 10:04.640
Christ

10:05.880 --> 10:11.680
Imagine the local Karen coming over to police what you put your kid in

10:15.600 --> 10:21.400
So I think it's nicer to dress people in all different colors, I mean she looked beautiful in yellow wouldn't she

10:25.200 --> 10:32.480
She was sorry, she's got pink trousers on. Oh my god. I do like the rainbow. I definitely like the rainbows on

10:32.480 --> 10:34.480
Like what the fuck is this lady's problem?

10:34.560 --> 10:37.880
Okay. Okay. Firstly. Yeah, you're wearing pink glasses

10:41.520 --> 10:43.520
Oh

10:45.400 --> 10:47.400
My god

10:48.320 --> 10:53.280
Yeah, she says pink, but they're not they are mode mode mode glasses

10:53.440 --> 10:55.440
Okay

11:06.720 --> 11:12.200
I'm actually stunned here to like why you're actually here. She just comes up to their place

11:12.200 --> 11:17.360
It's like why you keep dressed him going in pink. I think you should give her more choices of color. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, but

11:18.200 --> 11:22.500
She's however, I want to dress her. Okay. Yeah, the way how I parent it is

11:23.280 --> 11:25.280
With you, that's true

11:25.720 --> 11:30.520
Feel the people these days and I think they should have more choices of what colors they want to wear

11:30.520 --> 11:35.780
This lady is a book club or something. Fuck. I don't need to teach her about all this my god

11:36.320 --> 11:40.320
Like you can tell were those those weren't Austrian. Those are bonger accents, right?

11:40.320 --> 11:41.800
This is a Brit bong thing, man

11:41.800 --> 11:47.920
Imagine living in some British suburb and the local Karen comes up to you and complains that you put your daughter in pink clothes

11:47.920 --> 11:48.520
You know what?

11:48.520 --> 11:54.720
I think I finally understand why Sargon swung to the right wing because you wouldn't ever see this shit here in Canada

11:54.720 --> 11:57.000
Yeah, there's some weird shit happening with their government

11:57.000 --> 12:02.760
That's for sure. But like a random Karen coming up and complaining that your daughter's dressed in pink clothes. No fucking way

12:02.760 --> 12:09.840
No, wait, no shot as the zoomers say. Alright buddies. That's another tik-tok Tuesday clipped and shipped

12:09.840 --> 12:17.080
I know combined with yesterday's video in today's this was not exactly the most highbrow content that I've put out but don't worry

12:17.080 --> 12:23.120
We're coming back tomorrow with some good shit. I will see you guys there. Have a good one. I love you
