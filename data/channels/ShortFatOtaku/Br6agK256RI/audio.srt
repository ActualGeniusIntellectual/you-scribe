00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,220
Once again, friends, it's TikTok Tuesday time.

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,420
Some people said that I should actually get like a different background or maybe different

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,900
music to differentiate TikTok Tuesday from the 10-minute takes videos, now that it is

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,260
kind of becoming its own thing.

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,160
I probably will eventually, I just got to shake the tree of the guy who does my animated

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,160
backgrounds.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,760
Then again, fat dev at the computer table with a phone, that kind of fits, doesn't it?

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,760
I don't know.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,760
I don't know.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,760
But you guys have sent me a handful of more videos, so let's begin.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,760
They are writing another ticket, I think number 15.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
15 tickets?

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,760
We're handing out food to those who don't have the chance to get it easily.

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,760
Whoa, what?

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,760
There.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,760
Wait, hold on.

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,760
I got to watch that again.

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,760
They are writing another ticket.

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,160
Tickets for handing out food?

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,160
We're handing out food.

21
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,160
Yeah.

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,160
To those who don't.

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,160
To the homeless, I guess.

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,160
To get it easily.

25
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,440
Is that really a thing?

26
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,880
You can't hand out food to the homeless?

27
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,200
They're still getting ticketed?

28
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,960
Maybe it's because they're not an official charity.

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,300
Maybe it's because the food hasn't been checked by some sort of authority or secured or something,

30
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,240
so maybe it's full of poison, who the fuck knows, right?

31
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,000
It's possible.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,400
Maybe you have to actually be working with some sort of certified aid organization to

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,740
be able to do this legally.

34
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,920
That's possible, I guess.

35
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,960
It's kind of funny to listen to commies scream about, mutual aid, mutual aid, let us help

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,160
our poor unhoused neighbors, and then complaining when they get ticketed without doing it with

37
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:32,160
some sort of accreditation, when in other areas of life, they clearly understand the

38
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,860
need for accreditation.

39
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,560
Everything can't simply be anarchy.

40
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,600
I put a microchip in my arm, and it's the best thing ever.

41
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
What?

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
This chip is a powerhouse.

43
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
It's got everything I need.

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
My credit card, my ID, my phone, even my keys.

45
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Oh, this sounds unsafe.

46
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
And when it's time for grief, she's through it, and bam, transaction done.

47
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
It's like magic.

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
It's a medical emergency.

49
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
It can save my life.

50
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
The future is now, old man.

51
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
It's a medical history.

52
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
I feel like a sci-fi kid.

53
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
And I'm loving it.

54
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
This amazing chip is totally free.

55
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
That's right.

56
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Oh, don't trust the Australian government with this chip.

57
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
The surgery is quick.

58
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
It will give you a cookie afterward.

59
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
The government has frozen my bank account, and it can freeze your chip.

60
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
So you have to listen to my story.

61
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Oh God.

62
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Let's hear it.

63
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
A few days ago, I made a post on social media about a danger of having a chip implanted

64
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
in my arm.

65
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
I thought I was exercising my right to freeze my arm.

66
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,060
I thought it was that it was a

67
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,500
Hahaha, oh god. Let's hear it

68
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,700
Yeah, oh

69
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:31,260
Oh, no, oh your Starbucks doesn't get your Starbucks anymore

70
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,780
Oh

71
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,300
Oh, no, darlin, I

72
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,540
Remember back

73
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:53,840
Jesus I think was the I think was during gamergate times when Zoe Quinn was going around saying she was the first

74
00:02:54,100 --> 00:03:01,220
Cyborg because she implanted like a magnet underneath one of her fingertips so she could do like certain magnet jobs, right?

75
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,860
You know if you like a piece of if a tiny screw falls like deep into a tiny crevice inside of a computer

76
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,300
You're working on you got to get like a little magnet thing to fish it out

77
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,540
You have a magnet in the tip of your finger. You just reach in there poke it. Oh, you got it

78
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,260
You got it. Nice. Okay, what she also did was she put an NFC chip inside of her hand

79
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,340
I think the FCS are the same thing used in

80
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:27,220
Nintendo's amiibos the idea is that they can store very tiny amounts of information and even back then I was always thinking man if you're

81
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,020
Storing like sensitive information on this something can always go wrong

82
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,660
There are people who can scan cards by like running a device over your wallet or something

83
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,360
That's what the whole Ridge wallet thing is is supposed to block by the way not sponsored by Ridge wallet

84
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,220
But I do like their wallets

85
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,700
So if you want to give me some money Ridge wallet

86
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,260
But the point is is it the the the the I think they call them RFID blocking plates

87
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,740
You could have someone run a machine over your your wall or over your pocket as they walk by you

88
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,580
Scan information off the chip on your credit card and then use that to spoof the credit card

89
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:03,140
There's lots of ways to just scan people and get information from the stuff in there in their pockets nowadays

90
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:09,640
And so I always thought if you have a chip underneath your your finger or your arm or your hand yeah

91
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,420
It's convenient, and it's kind of cool to just like scan your hand and like a futuristic cyberpunk II kind of way

92
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,820
But man, that's dangerous

93
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:21,780
Criminals can just get your shit, and now as you've seen with this woman governments can just can just fuck you up

94
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,740
Oh, everything's on a chip. They can just lock you out if you have wrong think on the internet

95
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:30,920
She just told the police where they are hiding on live TV. Oh, no. Oh, oh my but

96
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,080
I just came out here to clear his name cuz I just I want him to go to jail and nothing like that

97
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,040
And I know they looking for him. They're not gonna find them. He at my mama house

98
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,600
Chilling they're just chillin no they waiting for me to pick them up right now, but I'm about to leave is this life

99
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Oh, is it? Oh?

100
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,400

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,160

Thanks for shopping as you just take everything

107
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,140
Wow

108
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:29,820
They're just walking out I keep finding videos every week that I do one of these tick-tock videos someone sends me a clip of

109
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:35,780
People just walking out of stores with arms arms full of stuff like no one gives a fuck

110
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,620
I I've been sitting on a on a book

111
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,900
It's a small book, but it's a leftist political theory book called in defense of looting

112
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,980
I've been sitting on that book for a while and now that the whole shoplifting craze is kind of going wild on social

113
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:54,020
Media, I should probably finally do that video too. This one's soundless. I think so just talk through it

114
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,460
Why the fuck's my hairline already receding? I'm only 17. Oh, dude, that sucks

115
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:04,900
Like that's my hairline now, and I'm in my 30s. He's 17. Fuck that sucks. You trying to trade homie?

116
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,620
Let's see. Let's see what this kid's got. I think how they're all growing their hair long to hide it. Oh

117
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,460

118
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,520
Yeah, you got to grow that hair long to hide it man

119
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,400
It can't get worse than this. Let's see that all all these bros are feeling it together. Oh

120
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,840
God oh, dude

121
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
We're all in it together

122
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
Let's see

123
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,320
Here's a twink kid. Oh

124
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,560
No, dude twink death is real. Oh my god

125
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,920

He's like almost fully bought. Oh my god

131
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,340
I'm sorry guys, like like I've still got most of my hair and I'm thankful for it

132
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,620
My hairline is definitely receding over the years

133
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,980
I can tell you can go back and watch a video of me from ten years ago. Definitely

134
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,200
Oh God girl harasses Gaston and he rightfully forces her to leave

135
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,980
Don't just touch him lady geez

136
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,380
Yeah, he's like get out oh

137
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,100
He's not joking get the fuck out

138
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:40,820
She's like, yep, you're done fuck you dude like that's just sexual assault and she's laughing like oh, it's completely fine

139
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,100
I'm a girl. I'm a harmless. Oh, it's like what the fuck?

140
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:49,060
No, in fact one of the comments underneath this was like, yeah, he overreacted you didn't have to embarrass her like that

141
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,880
What are you fucking kidding me reverse the sexes on this and see if you'd say that shit

142
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,560
You got some let's say you had Belle up there and a guy starts grabbing her tits. Like what the fuck is wrong with you?

143
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,900
It's a performance. There's kids there. Like are you are you fucking retarded? I just see him being a jerk

144
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,740
I wouldn't have done what she did but come on lol. These people actually think that women can't sexually assault men

145
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:15,660
It's pretty fucking disgusting. Oh shit. The drive-thru order is no good. Oh, no her car

146
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,860
Oh my god, oh the tree

147
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,620
Oh

148
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,700
My god, is she rolling out into traffic?

149
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,980
Sometimes McDonald's workers might put the wrong burger in your in your bag

150
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:44,020
But lady, you know, you're gonna step out of the car and freak out then it rolls away like oh my god

151
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,400
No

152
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,820
Now that Naomi and I actually have our own vehicle and we're driving around the city and we're doing stuff the more that I see

153
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,120
these car

154
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,620
Videos the more that I'm like, I'm still laughing at them. Like they're just oh, you're stupid

155
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,460
Haha, like I used to but now I'm like seeing how could you be that dumb?

156
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:04,340
How could you be that negligent considering how much stuff you have to like know and learn

157
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,260
To own and drive a car and what it's like to actually be behind the the driver's wheel

158
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:14,620
How could you how could you forget the important things to freak out about a burger? I don't I don't get it, dude

159
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,620
Hey, so you've come to my house to complain about my baby wearing pink

160
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,660
Well, I'm just asking really why you keep putting her in pink and not other colors. Well, traditionally girls often wear pink

161
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,160
It's not your baby lady. Well, I think you'll find that was back in the day. I don't think it's today

162
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,920
I think you can wear any color you want now. It's a fucking baby

163
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,780
It's even your baby yet. Just she doesn't just she actually she has over like clothes as well, but her favorite color is pink

164
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,280
Yeah in pink, and I think that's this fucking busybody dude

165
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
What do you mean freedom wants to be?

166
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,480
She's a baby

167
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
She's baby. She's two

168
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,200
Oh my god, well many of what's any of your concern?

169
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,920
Business lady because I believe that the world has got better since we've got all this fluidity with genders

170
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,640
Christ

171
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,680
Imagine the local Karen coming over to police what you put your kid in

172
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,400
So I think it's nicer to dress people in all different colors, I mean she looked beautiful in yellow wouldn't she

173
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,480
She was sorry, she's got pink trousers on. Oh my god. I do like the rainbow. I definitely like the rainbows on

174
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
Like what the fuck is this lady's problem?

175
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,880
Okay. Okay. Firstly. Yeah, you're wearing pink glasses

176
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,520
Oh

177
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
My god

178
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,280
Yeah, she says pink, but they're not they are mode mode mode glasses

179
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Okay

180
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,200
I'm actually stunned here to like why you're actually here. She just comes up to their place

181
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,360
It's like why you keep dressed him going in pink. I think you should give her more choices of color. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, but

182
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,500
She's however, I want to dress her. Okay. Yeah, the way how I parent it is

183
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,280
With you, that's true

184
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,520
Feel the people these days and I think they should have more choices of what colors they want to wear

185
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:35,780
This lady is a book club or something. Fuck. I don't need to teach her about all this my god

186
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,320
Like you can tell were those those weren't Austrian. Those are bonger accents, right?

187
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,800
This is a Brit bong thing, man

188
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,920
Imagine living in some British suburb and the local Karen comes up to you and complains that you put your daughter in pink clothes

189
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,520
You know what?

190
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:54,720
I think I finally understand why Sargon swung to the right wing because you wouldn't ever see this shit here in Canada

191
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah, there's some weird shit happening with their government

192
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,760
That's for sure. But like a random Karen coming up and complaining that your daughter's dressed in pink clothes. No fucking way

193
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:09,840
No, wait, no shot as the zoomers say. Alright buddies. That's another tik-tok Tuesday clipped and shipped

194
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:17,080
I know combined with yesterday's video in today's this was not exactly the most highbrow content that I've put out but don't worry

195
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:23,120
We're coming back tomorrow with some good shit. I will see you guys there. Have a good one. I love you
