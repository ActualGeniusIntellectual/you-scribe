{"text": " Once again, friends, it's TikTok Tuesday time. Some people said that I should actually get like a different background or maybe different music to differentiate TikTok Tuesday from the 10-minute takes videos, now that it is kind of becoming its own thing. I probably will eventually, I just got to shake the tree of the guy who does my animated backgrounds. Then again, fat dev at the computer table with a phone, that kind of fits, doesn't it? I don't know. I don't know. But you guys have sent me a handful of more videos, so let's begin. They are writing another ticket, I think number 15. 15 tickets? We're handing out food to those who don't have the chance to get it easily. Whoa, what? There. Wait, hold on. I got to watch that again. They are writing another ticket. Tickets for handing out food? We're handing out food. Yeah. To those who don't. To the homeless, I guess. To get it easily. Is that really a thing? You can't hand out food to the homeless? They're still getting ticketed? Maybe it's because they're not an official charity. Maybe it's because the food hasn't been checked by some sort of authority or secured or something, so maybe it's full of poison, who the fuck knows, right? It's possible. Maybe you have to actually be working with some sort of certified aid organization to be able to do this legally. That's possible, I guess. It's kind of funny to listen to commies scream about, mutual aid, mutual aid, let us help our poor unhoused neighbors, and then complaining when they get ticketed without doing it with some sort of accreditation, when in other areas of life, they clearly understand the need for accreditation. Everything can't simply be anarchy. I put a microchip in my arm, and it's the best thing ever. What? This chip is a powerhouse. It's got everything I need. My credit card, my ID, my phone, even my keys. Oh, this sounds unsafe. And when it's time for grief, she's through it, and bam, transaction done. It's like magic. It's a medical emergency. It can save my life. The future is now, old man. It's a medical history. I feel like a sci-fi kid. And I'm loving it. This amazing chip is totally free. That's right. Oh, don't trust the Australian government with this chip. The surgery is quick. It will give you a cookie afterward. The government has frozen my bank account, and it can freeze your chip. So you have to listen to my story. Oh God. Let's hear it. A few days ago, I made a post on social media about a danger of having a chip implanted in my arm. I thought I was exercising my right to freeze my arm. I thought it was that it was a Hahaha, oh god. Let's hear it Yeah, oh Oh, no, oh your Starbucks doesn't get your Starbucks anymore Oh Oh, no, darlin, I Remember back Jesus I think was the I think was during gamergate times when Zoe Quinn was going around saying she was the first Cyborg because she implanted like a magnet underneath one of her fingertips so she could do like certain magnet jobs, right? You know if you like a piece of if a tiny screw falls like deep into a tiny crevice inside of a computer You're working on you got to get like a little magnet thing to fish it out You have a magnet in the tip of your finger. You just reach in there poke it. Oh, you got it You got it. Nice. Okay, what she also did was she put an NFC chip inside of her hand I think the FCS are the same thing used in Nintendo's amiibos the idea is that they can store very tiny amounts of information and even back then I was always thinking man if you're Storing like sensitive information on this something can always go wrong There are people who can scan cards by like running a device over your wallet or something That's what the whole Ridge wallet thing is is supposed to block by the way not sponsored by Ridge wallet But I do like their wallets So if you want to give me some money Ridge wallet But the point is is it the the the the I think they call them RFID blocking plates You could have someone run a machine over your your wall or over your pocket as they walk by you Scan information off the chip on your credit card and then use that to spoof the credit card There's lots of ways to just scan people and get information from the stuff in there in their pockets nowadays And so I always thought if you have a chip underneath your your finger or your arm or your hand yeah It's convenient, and it's kind of cool to just like scan your hand and like a futuristic cyberpunk II kind of way But man, that's dangerous Criminals can just get your shit, and now as you've seen with this woman governments can just can just fuck you up Oh, everything's on a chip. They can just lock you out if you have wrong think on the internet She just told the police where they are hiding on live TV. Oh, no.
