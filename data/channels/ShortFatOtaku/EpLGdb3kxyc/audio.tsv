0	2480	Joe Biden is losing his mind.
2480	8160	Yeah, I did a video about Bernie yesterday, I've got to do a video about Biden today.
8160	11960	Because when it comes to the Democratic Party right now, at least in my opinion, no matter
11960	13720	who wins, we lose.
13720	16960	Neither of them are really fit to be the president, but for different reasons.
16960	19400	And with Biden, it's because he has dementia.
19400	21560	At this point, you can't say he doesn't.
21560	25000	There's so many examples, it's not even funny anymore, it's just sad.
25000	26940	And yeah, some of these are gaffes.
26940	31940	Like when Biden argued with the other candidates on stage during the debate over who has the
31940	32940	most blacks.
32940	37940	In the black community, and anybody else, double what you have for anybody else.
37940	39940	Wait a second, wait a second, it's Bernie.
39940	40940	That is quite right.
40940	41940	Let's not argue about polls.
41940	45820	No, this isn't the Democrats circa 1800, it's the Democrats today.
45820	50180	Or when during another debate, Biden said that he never called for cuts to Social Security,
50180	55740	when it was in fact obvious that yes, previously in his career, he had called for them.
55740	60980	When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well.
60980	62780	I meant Medicare and Medicaid.
62780	63780	I meant veterans' benefits.
63780	68180	I meant every single solitary thing in the government.
68180	71180	Biden's made a lot of gaffes over the course of his political career.
71180	72860	He's also known to be a stutterer.
72860	76460	And right now, the media is trying to play things off as if that's just the case.
76460	79620	But anyone with a brain knows, it's not stuttering anymore.
79620	81300	It's not, it's not gaffes anymore.
81300	84000	We are witnessing the early stages of dementia.
84000	87040	Like when Biden forgot the Declaration of Independence.
87040	89840	We hold these truths to be self-evident.
89840	93980	All men and women created by the, go, you know the, you know the thing.
93980	98640	Or when Biden during a live stream, and yes, candidates are now hosting official live streams.
98640	100560	That's democracy in the future, I guess.
100560	102680	He just wanders away.
102680	104080	He walks right out of frame.
104080	108240	And they in fact have to cut the feed in order to presumably have an aide come in and get
108240	109240	him situated again.
109240	115760	Which means that they can't build any factories or any, anything within one mile of the estuary
115760	119160	of the Delaware River and the Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake.
119160	123920	And so the whole point of this is that we can do a lot to deal with endangered species.
123920	129000	And one of the things I would like to raise is that we have to deal with this on an international
129000	130640	basis as well.
130640	136000	Because right now, for example, we have a thing, you know, Brazil has the Amazon is
136000	141160	burning because they're trying to clear the Amazon in order to make money in agriculture.
141160	167240	Or when he believed that he was vice president in 1976.
167240	175680	Or when he believed he was in Vermont when campaigning in New Hampshire.
175680	189160	Or in a very spooky coincidence, he says we can only re-elect Donald Trump.
189160	191820	Out of the mouths of dementia patients, I guess.
191820	205340	Though I guess if you want to see more dementia-addled truth, check this one out.
205340	209700	Joe Biden is a healthy, vigorous 77-year-old, his doctor declares.
209700	211860	Yeah, I don't buy it for a second.
211860	215820	And yes, the documents in this article describe somebody who seems to be quite physically
215820	216820	healthy.
216820	217820	But get this.
217820	221940	The only test that hasn't been done is the cognitive functioning test.
221940	226220	But the fact that he's on the campaign trail and meeting a rigorous travel and meeting
226220	231140	schedule probably would suffice as a replacement for the formal test for cognitive functioning.
231140	234020	Yeah, no, dude, do that test.
234020	236420	Ask Biden to draw a clock, see what comes out.
236420	237420	This is obvious BS.
237420	240560	We all know why he's not undergoing the cognitive functioning test.
240560	245120	On Forbes, there is an article published, Does Joe Biden have dementia?
245120	246340	Does it matter?
246340	247820	By Elizabeth Bower.
247820	250900	Forbes, however, has deleted the article.
250900	253460	You can kind of see it behind there, it's weird.
253460	255660	But this page is no longer active.
255660	261460	Well, thanks to the wonders of archive.is, you can just scroll past this and see the
261460	263460	rest of the article.
263460	264460	Let's take a look.
264460	268360	News outlets such as CNN are reporting that former Vice President Joe Biden has won the
268360	271860	primaries in the states of Michigan, Missouri, and Mississippi.
271860	276640	It becomes increasingly probable that Biden will be the Democratic nominee for president.
276640	280540	At the same time, among Republicans at any rate, speculation continues that, as is the
280540	285860	case for about 10% of Americans within his age range, Biden is impaired with dementia.
285860	290560	Some people dismiss evidence of Biden's incapacity as just a matter of gaffes, little mental
290560	292300	hiccups of no consequence.
292300	294660	They aren't gaffes or simple mistakes.
294660	297540	They are tokens of serious mental incapacity.
297540	298540	Judge for yourself.
298540	303340	How about his claim that 150 million Americans have been killed by guns since 2007?
303340	306060	Oh, I think I missed that one, dude.
306060	309660	Tomorrow is Superstar Tuesday, and I want to thank you all.
309660	313260	I tell you what, I'm rushing ahead, aren't I?
313260	320700	150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers
320700	321700	from liability.
321700	328040	It would put 720 million women back in the workforce.
328040	331080	Nobody should be in jail for a non-violent crime.
331080	335080	My name's Joe Biden, I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate.
335080	339760	Play the radio, make sure the television, excuse me, make sure you have the record player
339760	340760	on at night.
340760	344280	Poor kids are just as bright and just as tall as white kids.
344280	346360	We choose science over fiction.
346360	348880	We choose truth over facts.
348880	353160	From the Alzheimer's Association webpage, aggressive or angry behaviors may occur in
353160	355080	people with Alzheimer's or their dementias.
355080	359920	A 50-year career politician doesn't snap back this way to a blue-collar guy asking
359920	363720	him a reasonable question given his party's stance on the issue.
363720	367960	That is referring to a very public altercation between Biden and I think it was a factory
367960	370320	worker or a construction worker or something.
371320	376400	There is a large portion of the union workers that are gun enthusiasts and you are actively
376400	379120	trying to diminish your Second Amendment right and take away your gun.
379120	380120	You're full of shit.
380120	381120	Alright, thank you guys.
381120	382120	Shush.
382120	383120	Shush.
383120	384120	I support the Second Amendment.
384120	389120	The Second Amendment, just like right now, if you yell fire, that's not free speech.
389120	397680	From the very beginning, I have a shotgun, I have a 20-gauge, a 12-gauge, my son's hunt,
397680	398680	guess what?
398680	400800	You're not allowed to own any weapon.
400800	402920	I'm not taking your gun away at all.
402920	404920	You need 100 rounds and you're-
404920	406520	When you said you were going to take our guns, that means what?
406520	408040	I did not say that.
408040	409040	That's not true.
409040	410040	I did not say that.
410040	411040	It's a viral video.
411040	413040	It's a viral video like the other ones are putting out that are simply a lie.
413040	414040	It was your voice.
414040	415040	You said that.
415040	416040	You're taking the guns.
416040	417040	Well, he just clarified it.
417040	418040	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
418040	419040	Take the AR-14s.
419040	420040	Okay, this is not okay.
420040	421040	Hold on, hold on.
421040	422040	Hey, let's keep going.
422040	423040	There's a lot of guys.
423040	424040	A lot of guys want to-
424040	425040	You're welcome for me, man.
425040	426040	I'm not worried.
426040	427040	Hold on.
427040	428040	Give me a break, man.
428040	431680	Don't be such a horseman.
431680	436600	But even this article ends with the conclusion of Biden should take the test so that everyone
436600	438560	can just shut up about the issue.
438560	443400	Unless that is the claims of Republicans that he has been pushed and manipulated into this
443400	448260	election against his own best interest and he'd be better off having stayed in retirement
448260	449980	are actually well-founded.
449980	452040	He shouldn't take the test if that's the case.
452040	456880	She ends by saying that most Democrats don't actually expect Biden to even last his entire
456880	461460	term and simply hope that he'll pick a good VP, I guess, to take over.
461460	465500	There's another far less reasonable article on the topic and that one was already kind
465500	468040	of on the edge of reasonability.
468040	470600	You need to stop saying Joe Biden has dementia.
470600	471600	Why?
471600	477560	There's at least some evidence and he's not being tested for it.
477560	479040	He's avoiding the tests.
479040	481360	The DNC is keeping him out of the limelight.
481360	483600	They've restructured event schedules.
483600	488600	They've gone so far as to change the rules so that Tulsi Gabbard would not run circles
488600	492080	around the two geriatrics that are left on stage.
492080	496480	Obama repeatedly tried to get Biden not to run for president.
496480	500360	The former president is reportedly worried Biden will embarrass himself.
500360	502960	And this is what it's really all about.
502960	506000	The DNC, they really have nobody.
506000	507280	Elizabeth Warren fell apart.
507280	509180	They don't want Bernie Sanders.
509180	512060	And they won't dare try again with Hillary Clinton.
512060	514100	Biden's the only star they have.
514100	518860	What they're banking on is that whole return to normalcy thing.
518860	520920	That has been Biden's saying.
520920	523700	It's basically the neoliberal MAGA at this point.
523700	524940	Return to normalcy.
524940	529500	Go back to a previous era of politics before Trump came in and changed the game.
529500	534220	Go back to the neolibs and the neocons gracefully playing tennis with each other eight years
534220	535220	at a time.
535220	538740	Clinton, then Bush, then Obama, supposed to be Hillary next time.
538740	540220	Just back and forth.
540220	541780	Didn't really matter.
541780	543700	Policies weren't all that different between the two of them.
543700	545860	Kick cans down the road.
545860	546860	Return to normalcy.
546860	549260	That is what Biden's running on.
549260	556020	The DNC is hoping that people who are politically unengaged but have fond memories of the Obama
556020	561180	era will recognize Biden as being the former VP and will simply tick his name off based
561180	562660	on name recognition.
562660	565540	It doesn't matter to them that Biden's actually demented.
565540	568940	It doesn't matter to them that there's actually a fair chance Biden won't survive
568940	569940	his first term.
569940	573960	They don't care about his history, his previous hard work, his dignity as a human.
573960	576380	They only care about taking the reins of power.
576380	581340	Any one of us who has watched an older relative wither away, whether it's from dementia
581340	586540	or Alzheimer's or any of the other effects of old age, we can all see the beginning steps
586540	588660	with it in Biden.
588660	591300	And it's not a personal attack against him.
591300	595580	It's not hatred of Biden, hatred of Democrats or liberals, hatred of old people.
595580	596920	It's nothing like that.
596920	601040	Because the truth is, we will all be Biden one day.
601040	602280	Everybody gets old.
602280	605600	Everybody will suffer from something, and everybody will die.
605600	608340	It's not a personal attack against Biden's character.
608340	613260	It doesn't erase his previous accomplishments, his distinguished 50-year career.
613260	619220	But it does mean that now, at this point in his life, he's not fit to be president.
619220	623980	Trump is going to absolutely humiliate him, and that is no way to end such a distinguished
623980	625420	career as Biden's.
625420	627440	The DNC is in a rough spot right now.
627440	631940	The party itself does not want to be taken over by Bernie and the socialists, a reasonable
631940	634080	fear, though it might be somewhat overblown.
634080	635400	But who do they have left?
635400	640100	Kirsten Gillibrand, Tulsi Gabbard, and Pete Buttigieg could have actually beat Trump in
640100	643700	the general, had the DNC allowed any of them to rise to the top.
643700	648980	But no, they had to go for Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden, both of whom are fundamentally
648980	649980	unelectable.
649980	653740	Warren, because she's an unlikeable snake in the same way that Hillary Clinton was,
653740	657840	and Biden, because, frankly, he's just too old.
657840	663100	If Biden had run in 2016 instead of Hillary, that might have been a close race.
663100	664100	I'm not sure.
664100	665100	I really don't know.
665100	666920	Because Biden was still with it back then.
666920	669020	But his time's up.
669020	671720	I say this with respect for the man.
671720	676820	Biden should not be in this race, and the DNC keeping him in because of their own selfish
676820	679580	reasons is absolutely appalling.
