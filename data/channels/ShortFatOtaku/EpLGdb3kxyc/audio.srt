1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Joe Biden is losing his mind.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,160
Yeah, I did a video about Bernie yesterday, I've got to do a video about Biden today.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,960
Because when it comes to the Democratic Party right now, at least in my opinion, no matter

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,720
who wins, we lose.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,960
Neither of them are really fit to be the president, but for different reasons.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,400
And with Biden, it's because he has dementia.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,560
At this point, you can't say he doesn't.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,000
There's so many examples, it's not even funny anymore, it's just sad.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,940
And yeah, some of these are gaffes.

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,940
Like when Biden argued with the other candidates on stage during the debate over who has the

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,940
most blacks.

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,940
In the black community, and anybody else, double what you have for anybody else.

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,940
Wait a second, wait a second, it's Bernie.

14
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,940
That is quite right.

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,940
Let's not argue about polls.

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,820
No, this isn't the Democrats circa 1800, it's the Democrats today.

17
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,180
Or when during another debate, Biden said that he never called for cuts to Social Security,

18
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,740
when it was in fact obvious that yes, previously in his career, he had called for them.

19
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,980
When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well.

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,780
I meant Medicare and Medicaid.

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,780
I meant veterans' benefits.

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,180
I meant every single solitary thing in the government.

23
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,180
Biden's made a lot of gaffes over the course of his political career.

24
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,860
He's also known to be a stutterer.

25
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,460
And right now, the media is trying to play things off as if that's just the case.

26
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,620
But anyone with a brain knows, it's not stuttering anymore.

27
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,300
It's not, it's not gaffes anymore.

28
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,000
We are witnessing the early stages of dementia.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,040
Like when Biden forgot the Declaration of Independence.

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,840
We hold these truths to be self-evident.

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,980
All men and women created by the, go, you know the, you know the thing.

32
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,640
Or when Biden during a live stream, and yes, candidates are now hosting official live streams.

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,560
That's democracy in the future, I guess.

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,680
He just wanders away.

35
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,080
He walks right out of frame.

36
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,240
And they in fact have to cut the feed in order to presumably have an aide come in and get

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,240
him situated again.

38
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:55,760
Which means that they can't build any factories or any, anything within one mile of the estuary

39
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,160
of the Delaware River and the Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake.

40
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,920
And so the whole point of this is that we can do a lot to deal with endangered species.

41
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,000
And one of the things I would like to raise is that we have to deal with this on an international

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,640
basis as well.

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,000
Because right now, for example, we have a thing, you know, Brazil has the Amazon is

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,160
burning because they're trying to clear the Amazon in order to make money in agriculture.

45
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:47,240
Or when he believed that he was vice president in 1976.

46
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:55,680
Or when he believed he was in Vermont when campaigning in New Hampshire.

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:09,160
Or in a very spooky coincidence, he says we can only re-elect Donald Trump.

48
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,820
Out of the mouths of dementia patients, I guess.

49
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:25,340
Though I guess if you want to see more dementia-addled truth, check this one out.

50
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,700
Joe Biden is a healthy, vigorous 77-year-old, his doctor declares.

51
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,860
Yeah, I don't buy it for a second.

52
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,820
And yes, the documents in this article describe somebody who seems to be quite physically

53
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,820
healthy.

54
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,820
But get this.

55
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,940
The only test that hasn't been done is the cognitive functioning test.

56
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,220
But the fact that he's on the campaign trail and meeting a rigorous travel and meeting

57
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:51,140
schedule probably would suffice as a replacement for the formal test for cognitive functioning.

58
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,020
Yeah, no, dude, do that test.

59
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,420
Ask Biden to draw a clock, see what comes out.

60
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,420
This is obvious BS.

61
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,560
We all know why he's not undergoing the cognitive functioning test.

62
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,120
On Forbes, there is an article published, Does Joe Biden have dementia?

63
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,340
Does it matter?

64
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,820
By Elizabeth Bower.

65
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,900
Forbes, however, has deleted the article.

66
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,460
You can kind of see it behind there, it's weird.

67
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,660
But this page is no longer active.

68
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,460
Well, thanks to the wonders of archive.is, you can just scroll past this and see the

69
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,460
rest of the article.

70
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,460
Let's take a look.

71
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,360
News outlets such as CNN are reporting that former Vice President Joe Biden has won the

72
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,860
primaries in the states of Michigan, Missouri, and Mississippi.

73
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,640
It becomes increasingly probable that Biden will be the Democratic nominee for president.

74
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,540
At the same time, among Republicans at any rate, speculation continues that, as is the

75
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,860
case for about 10% of Americans within his age range, Biden is impaired with dementia.

76
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,560
Some people dismiss evidence of Biden's incapacity as just a matter of gaffes, little mental

77
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,300
hiccups of no consequence.

78
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,660
They aren't gaffes or simple mistakes.

79
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,540
They are tokens of serious mental incapacity.

80
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,540
Judge for yourself.

81
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,340
How about his claim that 150 million Americans have been killed by guns since 2007?

82
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,060
Oh, I think I missed that one, dude.

83
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,660
Tomorrow is Superstar Tuesday, and I want to thank you all.

84
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,260
I tell you what, I'm rushing ahead, aren't I?

85
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:20,700
150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers

86
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,700
from liability.

87
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:28,040
It would put 720 million women back in the workforce.

88
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,080
Nobody should be in jail for a non-violent crime.

89
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,080
My name's Joe Biden, I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate.

90
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,760
Play the radio, make sure the television, excuse me, make sure you have the record player

91
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
on at night.

92
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,280
Poor kids are just as bright and just as tall as white kids.

93
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,360
We choose science over fiction.

94
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,880
We choose truth over facts.

95
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,160
From the Alzheimer's Association webpage, aggressive or angry behaviors may occur in

96
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,080
people with Alzheimer's or their dementias.

97
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,920
A 50-year career politician doesn't snap back this way to a blue-collar guy asking

98
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,720
him a reasonable question given his party's stance on the issue.

99
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,960
That is referring to a very public altercation between Biden and I think it was a factory

100
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,320
worker or a construction worker or something.

101
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,400
There is a large portion of the union workers that are gun enthusiasts and you are actively

102
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,120
trying to diminish your Second Amendment right and take away your gun.

103
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
You're full of shit.

104
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
Alright, thank you guys.

105
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Shush.

106
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
Shush.

107
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
I support the Second Amendment.

108
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,120
The Second Amendment, just like right now, if you yell fire, that's not free speech.

109
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:37,680
From the very beginning, I have a shotgun, I have a 20-gauge, a 12-gauge, my son's hunt,

110
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
guess what?

111
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,800
You're not allowed to own any weapon.

112
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,920
I'm not taking your gun away at all.

113
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,920
You need 100 rounds and you're-

114
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,520
When you said you were going to take our guns, that means what?

115
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,040
I did not say that.

116
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
That's not true.

117
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
I did not say that.

118
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
It's a viral video.

119
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,040
It's a viral video like the other ones are putting out that are simply a lie.

120
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
It was your voice.

121
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
You said that.

122
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
You're taking the guns.

123
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
Well, he just clarified it.

124
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

125
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Take the AR-14s.

126
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Okay, this is not okay.

127
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Hold on, hold on.

128
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Hey, let's keep going.

129
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
There's a lot of guys.

130
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
A lot of guys want to-

131
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
You're welcome for me, man.

132
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
I'm not worried.

133
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
Hold on.

134
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Give me a break, man.

135
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,680
Don't be such a horseman.

136
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,600
But even this article ends with the conclusion of Biden should take the test so that everyone

137
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,560
can just shut up about the issue.

138
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,400
Unless that is the claims of Republicans that he has been pushed and manipulated into this

139
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,260
election against his own best interest and he'd be better off having stayed in retirement

140
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,980
are actually well-founded.

141
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,040
He shouldn't take the test if that's the case.

142
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,880
She ends by saying that most Democrats don't actually expect Biden to even last his entire

143
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,460
term and simply hope that he'll pick a good VP, I guess, to take over.

144
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,500
There's another far less reasonable article on the topic and that one was already kind

145
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,040
of on the edge of reasonability.

146
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,600
You need to stop saying Joe Biden has dementia.

147
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Why?

148
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,560
There's at least some evidence and he's not being tested for it.

149
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,040
He's avoiding the tests.

150
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,360
The DNC is keeping him out of the limelight.

151
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,600
They've restructured event schedules.

152
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,600
They've gone so far as to change the rules so that Tulsi Gabbard would not run circles

153
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,080
around the two geriatrics that are left on stage.

154
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,480
Obama repeatedly tried to get Biden not to run for president.

155
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,360
The former president is reportedly worried Biden will embarrass himself.

156
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,960
And this is what it's really all about.

157
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,000
The DNC, they really have nobody.

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,280
Elizabeth Warren fell apart.

159
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,180
They don't want Bernie Sanders.

160
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,060
And they won't dare try again with Hillary Clinton.

161
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,100
Biden's the only star they have.

162
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:38,860
What they're banking on is that whole return to normalcy thing.

163
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,920
That has been Biden's saying.

164
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,700
It's basically the neoliberal MAGA at this point.

165
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,940
Return to normalcy.

166
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,500
Go back to a previous era of politics before Trump came in and changed the game.

167
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,220
Go back to the neolibs and the neocons gracefully playing tennis with each other eight years

168
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,220
at a time.

169
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,740
Clinton, then Bush, then Obama, supposed to be Hillary next time.

170
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,220
Just back and forth.

171
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,780
Didn't really matter.

172
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,700
Policies weren't all that different between the two of them.

173
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,860
Kick cans down the road.

174
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,860
Return to normalcy.

175
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,260
That is what Biden's running on.

176
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:16,020
The DNC is hoping that people who are politically unengaged but have fond memories of the Obama

177
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,180
era will recognize Biden as being the former VP and will simply tick his name off based

178
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,660
on name recognition.

179
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,540
It doesn't matter to them that Biden's actually demented.

180
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,940
It doesn't matter to them that there's actually a fair chance Biden won't survive

181
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,940
his first term.

182
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,960
They don't care about his history, his previous hard work, his dignity as a human.

183
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,380
They only care about taking the reins of power.

184
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,340
Any one of us who has watched an older relative wither away, whether it's from dementia

185
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,540
or Alzheimer's or any of the other effects of old age, we can all see the beginning steps

186
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,660
with it in Biden.

187
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,300
And it's not a personal attack against him.

188
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,580
It's not hatred of Biden, hatred of Democrats or liberals, hatred of old people.

189
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,920
It's nothing like that.

190
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,040
Because the truth is, we will all be Biden one day.

191
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,280
Everybody gets old.

192
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,600
Everybody will suffer from something, and everybody will die.

193
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,340
It's not a personal attack against Biden's character.

194
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:13,260
It doesn't erase his previous accomplishments, his distinguished 50-year career.

195
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:19,220
But it does mean that now, at this point in his life, he's not fit to be president.

196
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,980
Trump is going to absolutely humiliate him, and that is no way to end such a distinguished

197
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,420
career as Biden's.

198
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,440
The DNC is in a rough spot right now.

199
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,940
The party itself does not want to be taken over by Bernie and the socialists, a reasonable

200
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,080
fear, though it might be somewhat overblown.

201
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,400
But who do they have left?

202
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,100
Kirsten Gillibrand, Tulsi Gabbard, and Pete Buttigieg could have actually beat Trump in

203
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,700
the general, had the DNC allowed any of them to rise to the top.

204
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:48,980
But no, they had to go for Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden, both of whom are fundamentally

205
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,980
unelectable.

206
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,740
Warren, because she's an unlikeable snake in the same way that Hillary Clinton was,

207
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,840
and Biden, because, frankly, he's just too old.

208
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,100
If Biden had run in 2016 instead of Hillary, that might have been a close race.

209
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,100
I'm not sure.

210
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,100
I really don't know.

211
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,920
Because Biden was still with it back then.

212
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,020
But his time's up.

213
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,720
I say this with respect for the man.

214
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,820
Biden should not be in this race, and the DNC keeping him in because of their own selfish

215
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,580
reasons is absolutely appalling.
