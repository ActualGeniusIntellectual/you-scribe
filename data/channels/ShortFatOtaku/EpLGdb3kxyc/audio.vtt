WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.480
Joe Biden is losing his mind.

00:02.480 --> 00:08.160
Yeah, I did a video about Bernie yesterday, I've got to do a video about Biden today.

00:08.160 --> 00:11.960
Because when it comes to the Democratic Party right now, at least in my opinion, no matter

00:11.960 --> 00:13.720
who wins, we lose.

00:13.720 --> 00:16.960
Neither of them are really fit to be the president, but for different reasons.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.400
And with Biden, it's because he has dementia.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.560
At this point, you can't say he doesn't.

00:21.560 --> 00:25.000
There's so many examples, it's not even funny anymore, it's just sad.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.940
And yeah, some of these are gaffes.

00:26.940 --> 00:31.940
Like when Biden argued with the other candidates on stage during the debate over who has the

00:31.940 --> 00:32.940
most blacks.

00:32.940 --> 00:37.940
In the black community, and anybody else, double what you have for anybody else.

00:37.940 --> 00:39.940
Wait a second, wait a second, it's Bernie.

00:39.940 --> 00:40.940
That is quite right.

00:40.940 --> 00:41.940
Let's not argue about polls.

00:41.940 --> 00:45.820
No, this isn't the Democrats circa 1800, it's the Democrats today.

00:45.820 --> 00:50.180
Or when during another debate, Biden said that he never called for cuts to Social Security,

00:50.180 --> 00:55.740
when it was in fact obvious that yes, previously in his career, he had called for them.

00:55.740 --> 01:00.980
When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well.

01:00.980 --> 01:02.780
I meant Medicare and Medicaid.

01:02.780 --> 01:03.780
I meant veterans' benefits.

01:03.780 --> 01:08.180
I meant every single solitary thing in the government.

01:08.180 --> 01:11.180
Biden's made a lot of gaffes over the course of his political career.

01:11.180 --> 01:12.860
He's also known to be a stutterer.

01:12.860 --> 01:16.460
And right now, the media is trying to play things off as if that's just the case.

01:16.460 --> 01:19.620
But anyone with a brain knows, it's not stuttering anymore.

01:19.620 --> 01:21.300
It's not, it's not gaffes anymore.

01:21.300 --> 01:24.000
We are witnessing the early stages of dementia.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.040
Like when Biden forgot the Declaration of Independence.

01:27.040 --> 01:29.840
We hold these truths to be self-evident.

01:29.840 --> 01:33.980
All men and women created by the, go, you know the, you know the thing.

01:33.980 --> 01:38.640
Or when Biden during a live stream, and yes, candidates are now hosting official live streams.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.560
That's democracy in the future, I guess.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.680
He just wanders away.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.080
He walks right out of frame.

01:44.080 --> 01:48.240
And they in fact have to cut the feed in order to presumably have an aide come in and get

01:48.240 --> 01:49.240
him situated again.

01:49.240 --> 01:55.760
Which means that they can't build any factories or any, anything within one mile of the estuary

01:55.760 --> 01:59.160
of the Delaware River and the Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake.

01:59.160 --> 02:03.920
And so the whole point of this is that we can do a lot to deal with endangered species.

02:03.920 --> 02:09.000
And one of the things I would like to raise is that we have to deal with this on an international

02:09.000 --> 02:10.640
basis as well.

02:10.640 --> 02:16.000
Because right now, for example, we have a thing, you know, Brazil has the Amazon is

02:16.000 --> 02:21.160
burning because they're trying to clear the Amazon in order to make money in agriculture.

02:21.160 --> 02:47.240
Or when he believed that he was vice president in 1976.

02:47.240 --> 02:55.680
Or when he believed he was in Vermont when campaigning in New Hampshire.

02:55.680 --> 03:09.160
Or in a very spooky coincidence, he says we can only re-elect Donald Trump.

03:09.160 --> 03:11.820
Out of the mouths of dementia patients, I guess.

03:11.820 --> 03:25.340
Though I guess if you want to see more dementia-addled truth, check this one out.

03:25.340 --> 03:29.700
Joe Biden is a healthy, vigorous 77-year-old, his doctor declares.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.860
Yeah, I don't buy it for a second.

03:31.860 --> 03:35.820
And yes, the documents in this article describe somebody who seems to be quite physically

03:35.820 --> 03:36.820
healthy.

03:36.820 --> 03:37.820
But get this.

03:37.820 --> 03:41.940
The only test that hasn't been done is the cognitive functioning test.

03:41.940 --> 03:46.220
But the fact that he's on the campaign trail and meeting a rigorous travel and meeting

03:46.220 --> 03:51.140
schedule probably would suffice as a replacement for the formal test for cognitive functioning.

03:51.140 --> 03:54.020
Yeah, no, dude, do that test.

03:54.020 --> 03:56.420
Ask Biden to draw a clock, see what comes out.

03:56.420 --> 03:57.420
This is obvious BS.

03:57.420 --> 04:00.560
We all know why he's not undergoing the cognitive functioning test.

04:00.560 --> 04:05.120
On Forbes, there is an article published, Does Joe Biden have dementia?

04:05.120 --> 04:06.340
Does it matter?

04:06.340 --> 04:07.820
By Elizabeth Bower.

04:07.820 --> 04:10.900
Forbes, however, has deleted the article.

04:10.900 --> 04:13.460
You can kind of see it behind there, it's weird.

04:13.460 --> 04:15.660
But this page is no longer active.

04:15.660 --> 04:21.460
Well, thanks to the wonders of archive.is, you can just scroll past this and see the

04:21.460 --> 04:23.460
rest of the article.

04:23.460 --> 04:24.460
Let's take a look.

04:24.460 --> 04:28.360
News outlets such as CNN are reporting that former Vice President Joe Biden has won the

04:28.360 --> 04:31.860
primaries in the states of Michigan, Missouri, and Mississippi.

04:31.860 --> 04:36.640
It becomes increasingly probable that Biden will be the Democratic nominee for president.

04:36.640 --> 04:40.540
At the same time, among Republicans at any rate, speculation continues that, as is the

04:40.540 --> 04:45.860
case for about 10% of Americans within his age range, Biden is impaired with dementia.

04:45.860 --> 04:50.560
Some people dismiss evidence of Biden's incapacity as just a matter of gaffes, little mental

04:50.560 --> 04:52.300
hiccups of no consequence.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.660
They aren't gaffes or simple mistakes.

04:54.660 --> 04:57.540
They are tokens of serious mental incapacity.

04:57.540 --> 04:58.540
Judge for yourself.

04:58.540 --> 05:03.340
How about his claim that 150 million Americans have been killed by guns since 2007?

05:03.340 --> 05:06.060
Oh, I think I missed that one, dude.

05:06.060 --> 05:09.660
Tomorrow is Superstar Tuesday, and I want to thank you all.

05:09.660 --> 05:13.260
I tell you what, I'm rushing ahead, aren't I?

05:13.260 --> 05:20.700
150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers

05:20.700 --> 05:21.700
from liability.

05:21.700 --> 05:28.040
It would put 720 million women back in the workforce.

05:28.040 --> 05:31.080
Nobody should be in jail for a non-violent crime.

05:31.080 --> 05:35.080
My name's Joe Biden, I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate.

05:35.080 --> 05:39.760
Play the radio, make sure the television, excuse me, make sure you have the record player

05:39.760 --> 05:40.760
on at night.

05:40.760 --> 05:44.280
Poor kids are just as bright and just as tall as white kids.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.360
We choose science over fiction.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.880
We choose truth over facts.

05:48.880 --> 05:53.160
From the Alzheimer's Association webpage, aggressive or angry behaviors may occur in

05:53.160 --> 05:55.080
people with Alzheimer's or their dementias.

05:55.080 --> 05:59.920
A 50-year career politician doesn't snap back this way to a blue-collar guy asking

05:59.920 --> 06:03.720
him a reasonable question given his party's stance on the issue.

06:03.720 --> 06:07.960
That is referring to a very public altercation between Biden and I think it was a factory

06:07.960 --> 06:10.320
worker or a construction worker or something.

06:11.320 --> 06:16.400
There is a large portion of the union workers that are gun enthusiasts and you are actively

06:16.400 --> 06:19.120
trying to diminish your Second Amendment right and take away your gun.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.120
You're full of shit.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.120
Alright, thank you guys.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.120
Shush.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.120
Shush.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.120
I support the Second Amendment.

06:24.120 --> 06:29.120
The Second Amendment, just like right now, if you yell fire, that's not free speech.

06:29.120 --> 06:37.680
From the very beginning, I have a shotgun, I have a 20-gauge, a 12-gauge, my son's hunt,

06:37.680 --> 06:38.680
guess what?

06:38.680 --> 06:40.800
You're not allowed to own any weapon.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.920
I'm not taking your gun away at all.

06:42.920 --> 06:44.920
You need 100 rounds and you're-

06:44.920 --> 06:46.520
When you said you were going to take our guns, that means what?

06:46.520 --> 06:48.040
I did not say that.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.040
That's not true.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.040
I did not say that.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.040
It's a viral video.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.040
It's a viral video like the other ones are putting out that are simply a lie.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.040
It was your voice.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.040
You said that.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.040
You're taking the guns.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.040
Well, he just clarified it.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.040
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.040
Take the AR-14s.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.040
Okay, this is not okay.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.040
Hold on, hold on.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.040
Hey, let's keep going.

07:02.040 --> 07:03.040
There's a lot of guys.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.040
A lot of guys want to-

07:04.040 --> 07:05.040
You're welcome for me, man.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.040
I'm not worried.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.040
Hold on.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.040
Give me a break, man.

07:08.040 --> 07:11.680
Don't be such a horseman.

07:11.680 --> 07:16.600
But even this article ends with the conclusion of Biden should take the test so that everyone

07:16.600 --> 07:18.560
can just shut up about the issue.

07:18.560 --> 07:23.400
Unless that is the claims of Republicans that he has been pushed and manipulated into this

07:23.400 --> 07:28.260
election against his own best interest and he'd be better off having stayed in retirement

07:28.260 --> 07:29.980
are actually well-founded.

07:29.980 --> 07:32.040
He shouldn't take the test if that's the case.

07:32.040 --> 07:36.880
She ends by saying that most Democrats don't actually expect Biden to even last his entire

07:36.880 --> 07:41.460
term and simply hope that he'll pick a good VP, I guess, to take over.

07:41.460 --> 07:45.500
There's another far less reasonable article on the topic and that one was already kind

07:45.500 --> 07:48.040
of on the edge of reasonability.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.600
You need to stop saying Joe Biden has dementia.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.600
Why?

07:51.600 --> 07:57.560
There's at least some evidence and he's not being tested for it.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.040
He's avoiding the tests.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.360
The DNC is keeping him out of the limelight.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.600
They've restructured event schedules.

08:03.600 --> 08:08.600
They've gone so far as to change the rules so that Tulsi Gabbard would not run circles

08:08.600 --> 08:12.080
around the two geriatrics that are left on stage.

08:12.080 --> 08:16.480
Obama repeatedly tried to get Biden not to run for president.

08:16.480 --> 08:20.360
The former president is reportedly worried Biden will embarrass himself.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.960
And this is what it's really all about.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.000
The DNC, they really have nobody.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.280
Elizabeth Warren fell apart.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.180
They don't want Bernie Sanders.

08:29.180 --> 08:32.060
And they won't dare try again with Hillary Clinton.

08:32.060 --> 08:34.100
Biden's the only star they have.

08:34.100 --> 08:38.860
What they're banking on is that whole return to normalcy thing.

08:38.860 --> 08:40.920
That has been Biden's saying.

08:40.920 --> 08:43.700
It's basically the neoliberal MAGA at this point.

08:43.700 --> 08:44.940
Return to normalcy.

08:44.940 --> 08:49.500
Go back to a previous era of politics before Trump came in and changed the game.

08:49.500 --> 08:54.220
Go back to the neolibs and the neocons gracefully playing tennis with each other eight years

08:54.220 --> 08:55.220
at a time.

08:55.220 --> 08:58.740
Clinton, then Bush, then Obama, supposed to be Hillary next time.

08:58.740 --> 09:00.220
Just back and forth.

09:00.220 --> 09:01.780
Didn't really matter.

09:01.780 --> 09:03.700
Policies weren't all that different between the two of them.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.860
Kick cans down the road.

09:05.860 --> 09:06.860
Return to normalcy.

09:06.860 --> 09:09.260
That is what Biden's running on.

09:09.260 --> 09:16.020
The DNC is hoping that people who are politically unengaged but have fond memories of the Obama

09:16.020 --> 09:21.180
era will recognize Biden as being the former VP and will simply tick his name off based

09:21.180 --> 09:22.660
on name recognition.

09:22.660 --> 09:25.540
It doesn't matter to them that Biden's actually demented.

09:25.540 --> 09:28.940
It doesn't matter to them that there's actually a fair chance Biden won't survive

09:28.940 --> 09:29.940
his first term.

09:29.940 --> 09:33.960
They don't care about his history, his previous hard work, his dignity as a human.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.380
They only care about taking the reins of power.

09:36.380 --> 09:41.340
Any one of us who has watched an older relative wither away, whether it's from dementia

09:41.340 --> 09:46.540
or Alzheimer's or any of the other effects of old age, we can all see the beginning steps

09:46.540 --> 09:48.660
with it in Biden.

09:48.660 --> 09:51.300
And it's not a personal attack against him.

09:51.300 --> 09:55.580
It's not hatred of Biden, hatred of Democrats or liberals, hatred of old people.

09:55.580 --> 09:56.920
It's nothing like that.

09:56.920 --> 10:01.040
Because the truth is, we will all be Biden one day.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.280
Everybody gets old.

10:02.280 --> 10:05.600
Everybody will suffer from something, and everybody will die.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.340
It's not a personal attack against Biden's character.

10:08.340 --> 10:13.260
It doesn't erase his previous accomplishments, his distinguished 50-year career.

10:13.260 --> 10:19.220
But it does mean that now, at this point in his life, he's not fit to be president.

10:19.220 --> 10:23.980
Trump is going to absolutely humiliate him, and that is no way to end such a distinguished

10:23.980 --> 10:25.420
career as Biden's.

10:25.420 --> 10:27.440
The DNC is in a rough spot right now.

10:27.440 --> 10:31.940
The party itself does not want to be taken over by Bernie and the socialists, a reasonable

10:31.940 --> 10:34.080
fear, though it might be somewhat overblown.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.400
But who do they have left?

10:35.400 --> 10:40.100
Kirsten Gillibrand, Tulsi Gabbard, and Pete Buttigieg could have actually beat Trump in

10:40.100 --> 10:43.700
the general, had the DNC allowed any of them to rise to the top.

10:43.700 --> 10:48.980
But no, they had to go for Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden, both of whom are fundamentally

10:48.980 --> 10:49.980
unelectable.

10:49.980 --> 10:53.740
Warren, because she's an unlikeable snake in the same way that Hillary Clinton was,

10:53.740 --> 10:57.840
and Biden, because, frankly, he's just too old.

10:57.840 --> 11:03.100
If Biden had run in 2016 instead of Hillary, that might have been a close race.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.100
I'm not sure.

11:04.100 --> 11:05.100
I really don't know.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.920
Because Biden was still with it back then.

11:06.920 --> 11:09.020
But his time's up.

11:09.020 --> 11:11.720
I say this with respect for the man.

11:11.720 --> 11:16.820
Biden should not be in this race, and the DNC keeping him in because of their own selfish

11:16.820 --> 11:19.580
reasons is absolutely appalling.
