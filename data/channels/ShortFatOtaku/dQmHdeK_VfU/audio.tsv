0	7800	We all know Dlive's a scam at this point, right?
7800	10280	I mean, come on, I've done a couple videos on it, people have been talking about it all
10280	13240	over the place, even PewDiePie abandoned the platform to go back to YouTube.
13240	16000	But there's been some weird stuff happening with it the past few months.
16000	20000	I recommend you go back and actually watch my previous videos if you want context on
20000	21000	this.
21000	22240	But here's the basic idea.
22240	25800	Three years ago, Dlive was part of the Steam blockchain.
25800	30640	It seemed like it was only on that blockchain in order to learn how to build its own blockchain,
30640	35160	and then once the guys behind Dlive basically stole the knowledge, they left to join the
35160	37200	Lino blockchain.
37200	42880	Even though Lino is, or was, its own company, there was a lot of overlapping staff with
42880	46720	Dlive, and it seems like they all just came out of the same graduating year at some west
46720	47720	coast school.
47720	49740	Here's how Lino basically worked.
49740	55320	Viewers could buy Lino, or I think in some instances earn Lino by watching other streamers.
55320	58920	These came in the form of cutesy little tokens like lemons or ice creams or whatever.
58920	62840	Then you could donate those things to the streamers who could then cash them out.
62840	68440	However, streamers were actively encouraged by Dlive not to cash them out, but instead
68440	69760	to stake them.
69760	74540	The idea with staked Lino would be that you can't actually withdraw it for three months,
74540	76000	but it would slowly grow.
76000	77880	You would earn Lino interest.
77880	82400	This was supposed to give the Lino network, and by extension Dlive, some added stability.
82400	85460	The idea that there was still money in the system and there were still people invested
85460	86960	in the growth of the system.
86960	90760	Some people, in fact, put quite a bit of money into Lino and staked it.
90760	93760	It's hard to find information on this at this point, because it's been a little while,
93760	99160	but I think how it used to work would be that you had to lock in your Lino for a set amount
99160	103480	of time, and then when you unlocked it, it would only slowly trickle into your account
103480	104680	plus the interest.
104680	109520	However, streamers could absolutely cash out the Lino using PayPal until PayPal was removed,
109520	112120	and then they could do it through direct deposit into your bank.
112160	116560	And aside from paying for the transfer costs, you would get the entirety of your Lino.
116560	118320	Dlive wasn't taking a cut.
118320	122840	They were, in fact, aiming for massive growth, presumably with the hopes that they would
122840	124560	attract some kind of big investor.
124560	127240	I'm sure signing with PewDiePie was also part of the plan.
127240	130000	And that is exactly what ended up happening at the end of last year.
130000	135200	Dlive joins the BitTorrent ecosystem and begins migration to the Tron blockchain.
135200	140160	Okay, so they went from the Steemit blockchain to the Lino blockchain, and now they're
140160	142120	on the Tron blockchain.
142120	144000	So they were basically bought out by BitTorrent.
144000	145000	Okay, fair enough.
145000	151040	The whole Tron crypto thing is a more known entity than Lino ever was, and there's certainly
151040	152680	a bit more confidence surrounding this.
152680	156040	But then the big question was, what happens to all your Lino?
156040	159640	What happens to all the people who had Lino staked in?
159640	160640	How do they get their money?
160640	163480	Well, here's their migration timeline.
163480	168760	January 15th, 2020, the ACE Protocol Foundation will release a detailed plan to introduce
168760	173680	BTT tokens to all existing Lino and Lino stakeholders.
173680	178240	In quarter one of 2020, Dlive will merge its account systems with BitTorrents.
178240	183240	Late quarter one 2020, the Lemon and Lino Stake systems will be updated to further integrate
183240	186440	with BTT token and the Tron blockchain.
186440	192240	Late quarter two 2020, deep content integration within BitTorrent and uTorrent's desktop
192240	194020	and mobile clients.
194020	197320	This is from the Lino website from back at the end of February 2020.
197320	200040	The BTT conversion gateway is ready.
200040	201280	Thank you for this amazing journey.
201280	202840	Now fasten your seatbelts.
202840	208320	All non-US Lino token holders who choose to exchange their Lino tokens into BitTorrent
208320	213520	tokens, which are BTTs, can choose to convert their Lino tokens to BTT starting at 4 p.m.
213520	219080	PST on the 24th of February, up until 1259 p.m. PST, the 14th of April.
219080	223920	Each day, up until the cutoff date, Lino token holders can choose to convert their Lino tokens
223920	228920	to BTT based off the average 24-hour market price on Poloniex exchange.
228920	235720	So okay, since Lino was just a massively inflated token given value only by Dlive's investors,
235720	240480	and the BitTorrent token is actually a crypto, they were offering some method of exchange
240480	242680	up until the April 14th cutoff.
242680	244480	Fair enough, that actually sounds pretty good.
244480	247640	That was for non-American Lino holders, here it is for the States.
247640	252100	Dlive, the foundation's partner, will accept Lino for the purchase of Lemons on the Dlive
252100	253100	platform.
253100	258420	Lemons is a fixed value platform currency used in Dlive and can only be used to make
258420	261520	purchases and donations on the Dlive platform.
261520	263380	Lemons are basically like the Twitch bits.
263380	267980	On Twitch you can spend money to get bits, donate bits to streamers, and then only streamers
267980	270620	can take donated bits and convert that back into money.
270620	275000	And it's in those conversions between money to bits to money that Twitch takes their cut
275000	276000	off the top.
276000	279940	So if you were a viewer who had a bunch of Lino, your only option if you were an American
279940	283680	was to basically cash out into Lemons and then donate them to somebody.
283680	287320	If you were a streamer and you had a bunch of Lemons, you could still use the get paid
287320	291820	function to convert those Lemons into actual money, but what would you do with your Lino?
291820	294920	It really sounds like here that even as a streamer you could only take those Lino, convert
294920	296940	them into Lemons, and then give them to somebody else.
296940	301920	What happens to the Lino blockchain and Lino coin and stake after the migration on April
301920	302920	15th?
302920	308920	Beginning January 15th at 10pm, Lino blockchain validators will implement an upgrade that
308920	312580	allows all Lino stake to be staked out in one day.
312580	314620	That's better than three months.
314620	318980	This means all stakes that have been processed before this time and after this time will
318980	322420	all be staked out into Lino within one day.
322420	327100	For those Lino account holders who wish to retain their Lino stake, staking rewards are
327100	331460	expected to continue functioning until the cut off time.
331460	334700	There haven't ever been any real staking rewards, by the way.
334700	338400	The Foundation strongly recommends that all Lino stakeholders stake out before the cut
338400	339460	off time.
339460	343500	After the cut off time, the Foundation will no longer support the Lino blockchain and
343500	345460	Lino coin or Lino stake.
345460	349500	There is no assurance that Lino tokens can be transferred or that there is any value
349500	352640	or functionality in the Lino blockchain after the cut off time.
352640	358140	So basically, DLive was dropping Lino and switching over to BitTorrent's ecosystem.
358140	363820	The Lino network and the Lino currency associated with it was going to be completely destroyed.
363820	365740	Something known as, I think, coin burning.
365740	371240	I'm not completely up on the whole crypto thing, but basically it was no longer going
371240	377960	to be a usable currency and they were offering through a crypto exchange known as Poloniex.com
377960	384720	to transfer your Lino into BTT and then presumably you could take that BTT and sell it on Poloniex
384720	386600	and get dollars like you always would.
386600	392120	From what I've been able to find, the exchange rate from Lino to BTT and then from BTT to
392120	396500	dollars is approximately the same as the old exchange rate of directly cashing out
396500	400260	your Lino into dollars using DLive's get paid button.
400260	404500	So really, the only people who got seriously burned here are the people who were like die-hard
404500	407840	DLive fans, the ones that thought that this was the future and Lino was going to be a
407840	408840	big thing.
408840	409840	No, it was just abandoned.
409840	412300	And really, the only way you got hurt is through your ego.
412300	415380	It's not like people are losing tons of money, are they?
415380	421220	Well firstly, even though Lino is now a dead network and a dead currency, the site is still
421780	428200	and you can still create a wallet and give them money for a currency that no longer exists.
428200	430000	Maybe this site should go down, guys.
430000	433200	Although it still has PewDiePie on it, so I guess they're just not paying attention
433200	434200	anymore.
434200	437200	But there were a few big draws of DLive back when they were really pushing it.
437200	440020	One, it was the claim that they were supposedly decentralized.
440020	445960	And two, that somehow through this roundabout Lino system, DLive wasn't taking a cut.
445960	450920	And this fellow named Eric Wilson on his blog ran the math and realized that's no longer
450920	453160	the case now that they're over on Tron.
453160	458720	After BTT staking is enabled on DLive, streamers will get less of a percentage than on Twitch.
458720	461740	And I think on Twitch they already get half or something?
461740	465260	I didn't know anything about Tron, so I literally had to start at the ground floor.
465260	468060	Friends that I greatly respect showed immediate concerns.
468060	470180	I played the wait and see game.
470180	474300	I absolutely believe that DLive would have folded if it weren't for Justin Sun.
474300	476900	Remember that name, Justin Sun.
476900	480900	They called it a partnership, but he bought them out and kept them afloat.
480900	484480	So in a way it is sort of a, what does the community have to lose?
484480	488360	Apparently what they have to lose is 15% more of their donations.
488360	489560	And here's the spreadsheet.
489560	495720	On Twitch, for 100 bits, which is worth $1 to a streamer, you pay $1.40 and it seems
495720	498320	like Twitch gets a cut of 40 cents.
498320	501920	So it's like 33% or 30% or something.
501920	506520	I know Twitch takes a 50% cut when it comes to the sub button via the monthly Twitch subs,
506520	510040	but when it comes to bits, it seems to be a little bit different.
510040	516580	However, over on DLive, 88 lemons, which is worth $1.06, costs $1.53.
516580	522220	There's taxes, but then there's also something called a donation tax, as well as DLive's
522220	523820	cut of 74 cents.
523820	526640	And the streamer only gets to withdraw 79 cents.
526640	530540	So DLive's old claim that they don't take a cut just isn't true anymore.
530540	532500	In fact, the cut they take is bigger.
532500	534860	Initially they ran everything on the lino testnet.
534860	536140	Your lino points could be staked.
536140	537380	It was an easy calculation.
537380	542920	Every time someone donated, 9.9% of the donation went towards the community staked pot.
542920	547320	What you received from stake rewards depended on the daily pot, how much total was staked,
547320	548920	and how much you had staked.
548920	553000	Basically, your percentage of the total staked gets that percentage of the staked pot.
553000	557840	This entire time, lino was available to be purchased and sold through the lino network
557840	563000	only for a flat price of 0.012 US dollars.
563000	566680	I would like to add that they paid for their validators through the inflation.
566680	570980	Part of that inflation was also used as content bonuses based on a bunch of math.
570980	572060	Then they changed it.
572060	574740	They wanted to change it to two different coins.
574740	577940	Lino would be now only used for staking and rewards.
577940	581660	And they added lemons as the stable coin and the donation coin of the platform, keeping
581660	583700	the price the same on that.
583700	589740	How it worked was 9.9% of lemon donations were converted to lino to be distributed to
589740	590740	stakeholders.
590740	593000	What happened then was obvious and very predictable.
593000	594780	This platform was full of streamers.
594780	600080	It is very, very top heavy of streamers compared to viewers, having many content creators without
600080	602020	the large content consumption audience.
602020	605960	The reason this is such a big deal is much of the donations were between stakeholders
605960	609200	who were also getting donations and staked rewards.
609200	612320	People were using their staked rewards to donate to other streamers.
612320	616300	Once they changed it to lino and lemons, however, the liquid lemons used to donate were drying
616300	622000	up because 9.9% of the lemons were essentially burned and converted to lino every time it
622000	626000	was donated, taking the liquidity out of the available donations.
626000	630880	Then the only way you could get more lemons was to be donated them or buy them.
630880	633480	Everyone paying attention could see what was happening.
633480	635760	Donations were slowing down and continued to drop.
635760	639300	I can only assume that when they changed over to lemons, it was their hope that purchases
639300	643040	of lemons would outpace their need to pay for servers and paying out to streamers.
643040	647980	I felt, even then when things were sort of exciting, the end was near.
647980	652140	Several articles from over a year ago where people asked Charles Wayne, one of the guys
652140	656520	behind this whole thing, how he planned for this operation to be profitable, he basically
656520	658420	said that in the short term he didn't.
658420	662540	He wanted to focus on massive short term growth in order to attract an investor that would
662540	663780	hopefully buy his company.
663780	667260	And as we can see, this was the logical end result of that.
667260	669400	They basically started running out of money.
669400	674020	But now that the percentage of donations that went to staking rewards was up from 9.9% to
674020	676400	25%, that is more money for the community.
676400	677560	No it's not.
677560	682200	That's more money for BTT holders, which very likely is mostly Justin's son.
682200	685040	BTT has been available for over a year.
685040	687640	BTT holders are largely outside the platform.
687640	690840	And this next little bit here is from the BTT whitepaper.
690840	697840	BTT token issuance, we will create a total supply of 99 trillion BTT.
697840	701240	Public sale tokens constitute 6% of total token supply.
701240	704060	Private sale tokens constitute 2% of total token supply.
704060	709940	Bittorrent team and the Bittorrent foundation were at 19%, the Tron foundation got 20%,
709940	715520	the Bittorrent ecosystem is allocated 19%, and partnership tokens constitute 4%.
715520	718900	So basically, as the Lino token was being spread around and people were starting to
718900	723840	get more and more of it, they decided to switch to this previously created token system where
723840	729060	a large chunk of the token is owned by some select insiders.
729060	730580	Including Justin's son.
730580	734380	Imagine growing your brand on Dlive, thinking you're a whale and then this happens.
734380	739300	If you were in the United States during the conversion, you had to do KYC verification
739300	740820	and cash out.
740820	746240	If you were outside of the country, you had to use Justin's son's Poloniex exchange
746240	747860	to get your BTT.
747860	749440	And that's the rub, isn't it?
749440	753740	Justin's son owns Poloniex.com, the only exchange that allowed you to transfer your
753740	756980	Lino out into something resembling real currency.
756980	762660	So yeah, if you were a Dlive streamer between January and April of this year, if you were
762660	765820	in the US, you'd do KYC verification and cash out.
765820	770660	If you were outside the US, you had to use Justin's son's exchange site to transfer
770660	776240	your Lino into Justin's son's BTT and then try to cash that out into real money.
776240	779860	And all those people who didn't do it on time, well, that money was just lost.
779860	784640	It was simply kept by Dlive and most likely kept by Justin's son since he's the one
784640	785780	who bought them out.
785780	789980	The amount of Lino converted compared to the amount of BTT already out there is a drop
789980	791080	in the bucket.
791080	794780	There is no way the Dlive community is going to get any sort of majority of rewards with
794780	796100	this.
796100	798820	This is further centralization and protection.
798820	804780	So this blog post is talking more about the centralized versus decentralized part of the
804780	806380	argument when it comes to Dlive.
806380	809700	And fair enough, this is further centralization and protection.
809700	812420	And it completely goes against the Dlive that we were all sold.
812580	815860	However, personally, I'm a bit more interested in the part of the conversation where Justin
815860	817620	sunlines his own pockets.
817620	823020	Here's a testimonial by somebody who, during the actual proper cash out period for Lino,
823020	824880	was trying to do just that.
824880	827220	They forced us to lock our Lino points in.
827220	832140	I literally just put in a request to unlock my Lino a month ago and now suddenly the Lino
832140	833760	isn't worth anything.
833760	838380	It claims on that page you can buy lemons with Lino, but this functionality doesn't
838380	839980	actually exist.
839980	842820	His website was just one giant scam.
842820	844500	No different than a pump and dump.
844500	848400	They got a bunch of people to give them money for worthless Lino by paying off PewDiePie
848400	850300	and using his fanbase.
850300	854980	And they just literally kept all the money and turned Lino into a worthless crypto that
854980	857580	you have to convert into some other crypto now.
857580	861180	And that does sound like what I predicted they would do about a year ago.
861180	864680	They were going to blow smoke up everybody's ass about Lino, get people to drop a whole
864680	867580	bunch of money on it, and then basically run away with it.
867580	871940	Of course, there were ways, at least during the grace period, to turn your Lino into another
871940	873260	usable crypto.
873260	878860	But it was convoluted, and it involved Justin Sun taking multiple cuts and fees every step
878860	879860	of the way.
879860	883020	The thing is, though, this isn't the first time this has happened, and I don't mean
883020	884160	just with Steemit.
884160	890480	October of last year, decentralized streaming platform Dlive partners with the Theta network
890480	893020	to engage users with token rewards.
893020	897340	How many companies and blockchains and ecosystems is Dlive going to go through?
897340	899460	The truth is, this was always going to happen.
899460	903620	At some point, the people behind Dlive were going to pull the rug out from everyone else.
903620	905380	What they did wasn't illegal.
905380	909740	What would be illegal, at least according to current laws regarding crypto, is if they
909740	915080	unilaterally massively devalued Lino, right before their acquisition by BitTorrent, basically
915080	918800	leaving everyone who had money in Lino high and dry.
918800	920380	They didn't quite do that.
920380	923800	That would have been the best way for them to scam the maximum amount of money, but it
923800	926060	also probably would have got them shut down.
926060	927880	So they did the next best thing.
927880	930340	They set it up so that Lino would become valueless.
930340	935820	Oh, and by the way, you can still give them money for their useless token after the value
935820	938140	has been set to zero for some dumb reason.
938140	941940	And everyone who has Lino, well, you just have to transfer over to this new token that
941940	943100	they've got going.
943100	946100	Of course, the transfer will have a minor fee, don't worry about it.
946100	950780	I wonder if in a year or two's time, assuming Dlive is still around, if they transfer away
950780	955920	from the BitTorrent ecosystem to another blockchain, will there be another transfer fee?
955920	960760	Will you once again have to use the owner of the company's proprietary software or something
960760	964680	to make the transfer and there's a charge associated with that as well?
964680	970720	This isn't a scam, but it is like on the very edge of being a scam.
970720	975100	People are still getting paid on this site, even though it's at this point quite dead
975100	976920	now that PewDiePie's off of it.
976920	981680	But you're jumping through hoops, you're losing money along the way, cuts and skims off the
981680	983720	top are coming left, right, and center.
983720	988880	And despite their initial promise of we don't take any of your money, Dlive's actually worse
988880	991480	than the big names when it comes to this sort of stuff.
991480	994920	And you know, I don't think that PewDiePie actually knew about this.
994920	1001440	I think he just likes the idea of some kind of streaming service or a video service or
1001440	1005240	something that's not YouTube, because YouTube is frankly pretty shit nowadays, and he took
1005240	1006640	a chance on Dlive.
1006640	1009560	Of course he took a chance because they offered him a big bucket full of money, but nonetheless
1009560	1010560	he took a chance on Dlive.
1010560	1015000	I don't think PewDiePie was being malicious, I just think he was being kind of dumb.
1015000	1016920	No offense to the guy personally, I like his videos.
1016920	1020280	And I think this because he's done it before.
1020280	1026240	Here's a video of PewDiePie promoting S-Game Pro, a mobile games platform where users can
1026240	1030280	mine their crypto by just playing the games on the platform.
1030280	1034240	It too turned out to be a scam.
1034240	1042400	So listen up people, PewDiePie is going to tell you about S-Game Pro, a wonderful place
1042400	1052740	where you can mine crypto tokens just by playing some of the world's most popular mobile games.
1052740	1056800	Play mine urn.
1056800	1060920	Players log into the platform to chat, stream and complete PVP games.
1060920	1065080	Winners get rewarded with highly liquid ERC20 crypto tokens.
1065080	1070620	You can exchange SGM for other cryptos, use it to shop in the online store, get gift cards
1070620	1072880	or cash it in for real life money.
1072880	1079600	Plus the total supply of SGM is capped at 350 million and 139 million is already sold.
1079600	1082120	So it's pretty popular already.
1082120	1086680	Play mine urn with S-Game Pro.
1086680	1089160	You know, I'm not Pewds, obviously.
1089160	1093360	I'm sure he has a better idea of how to run his business than I ever would.
1093360	1098420	But as an outsider looking in, as a little guy with no clout whatsoever, it really seems
1098420	1102780	like unless he's intentionally ripping people off, and I don't think he is, he needs to
1102780	1105600	pay a little bit more attention to what he promotes.
1105600	1110360	Because in so far as decentralized platforms are concerned, he's batting zero for two.
1110360	1115880	A lot of these people, Justin Sun, Charles Wayne, everyone behind Lino and Tron and Dlive,
1115880	1120260	a lot of them are Chinese nationals who moved to the United States to go to school.
1120260	1124480	That's not a problem in and of itself, but they've all taken Chinese money.
1124480	1129660	All of their projects have gone through multiple funding rounds coming from Chinese angel investors
1129660	1131460	and venture capitalists.
1131460	1135820	And that means somewhere along the line, the PRC is involved.
1135820	1139120	And at least to me, that is absolutely unacceptable.
1139120	1142400	Anyway, with PewDiePie gone, Dlive is dying.
1142400	1146600	Hopefully I won't have to do another video updating you on all of the Dlive stuff that's
1146600	1150960	been happening, because frankly, the main social media video and streaming sites are
1150960	1151960	bad enough.
1151960	1155600	I don't think we need to be talking about how the tinier ones are even worse, you know?
