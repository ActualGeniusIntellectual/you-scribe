1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
We all know Dlive's a scam at this point, right?

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,280
I mean, come on, I've done a couple videos on it, people have been talking about it all

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,240
over the place, even PewDiePie abandoned the platform to go back to YouTube.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,000
But there's been some weird stuff happening with it the past few months.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I recommend you go back and actually watch my previous videos if you want context on

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
this.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,240
But here's the basic idea.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,800
Three years ago, Dlive was part of the Steam blockchain.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,640
It seemed like it was only on that blockchain in order to learn how to build its own blockchain,

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,160
and then once the guys behind Dlive basically stole the knowledge, they left to join the

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,200
Lino blockchain.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,880
Even though Lino is, or was, its own company, there was a lot of overlapping staff with

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,720
Dlive, and it seems like they all just came out of the same graduating year at some west

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,720
coast school.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,740
Here's how Lino basically worked.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:55,320
Viewers could buy Lino, or I think in some instances earn Lino by watching other streamers.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,920
These came in the form of cutesy little tokens like lemons or ice creams or whatever.

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,840
Then you could donate those things to the streamers who could then cash them out.

19
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,440
However, streamers were actively encouraged by Dlive not to cash them out, but instead

20
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,760
to stake them.

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,540
The idea with staked Lino would be that you can't actually withdraw it for three months,

22
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,000
but it would slowly grow.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,880
You would earn Lino interest.

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,400
This was supposed to give the Lino network, and by extension Dlive, some added stability.

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,460
The idea that there was still money in the system and there were still people invested

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,960
in the growth of the system.

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,760
Some people, in fact, put quite a bit of money into Lino and staked it.

28
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,760
It's hard to find information on this at this point, because it's been a little while,

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,160
but I think how it used to work would be that you had to lock in your Lino for a set amount

30
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,480
of time, and then when you unlocked it, it would only slowly trickle into your account

31
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,680
plus the interest.

32
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,520
However, streamers could absolutely cash out the Lino using PayPal until PayPal was removed,

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,120
and then they could do it through direct deposit into your bank.

34
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,560
And aside from paying for the transfer costs, you would get the entirety of your Lino.

35
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,320
Dlive wasn't taking a cut.

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,840
They were, in fact, aiming for massive growth, presumably with the hopes that they would

37
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,560
attract some kind of big investor.

38
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,240
I'm sure signing with PewDiePie was also part of the plan.

39
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,000
And that is exactly what ended up happening at the end of last year.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,200
Dlive joins the BitTorrent ecosystem and begins migration to the Tron blockchain.

41
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,160
Okay, so they went from the Steemit blockchain to the Lino blockchain, and now they're

42
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,120
on the Tron blockchain.

43
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,000
So they were basically bought out by BitTorrent.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Okay, fair enough.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,040
The whole Tron crypto thing is a more known entity than Lino ever was, and there's certainly

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,680
a bit more confidence surrounding this.

47
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,040
But then the big question was, what happens to all your Lino?

48
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,640
What happens to all the people who had Lino staked in?

49
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,640
How do they get their money?

50
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,480
Well, here's their migration timeline.

51
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,760
January 15th, 2020, the ACE Protocol Foundation will release a detailed plan to introduce

52
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,680
BTT tokens to all existing Lino and Lino stakeholders.

53
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,240
In quarter one of 2020, Dlive will merge its account systems with BitTorrents.

54
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Late quarter one 2020, the Lemon and Lino Stake systems will be updated to further integrate

55
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,440
with BTT token and the Tron blockchain.

56
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,240
Late quarter two 2020, deep content integration within BitTorrent and uTorrent's desktop

57
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,020
and mobile clients.

58
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,320
This is from the Lino website from back at the end of February 2020.

59
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,040
The BTT conversion gateway is ready.

60
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,280
Thank you for this amazing journey.

61
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,840
Now fasten your seatbelts.

62
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,320
All non-US Lino token holders who choose to exchange their Lino tokens into BitTorrent

63
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,520
tokens, which are BTTs, can choose to convert their Lino tokens to BTT starting at 4 p.m.

64
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,080
PST on the 24th of February, up until 1259 p.m. PST, the 14th of April.

65
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,920
Each day, up until the cutoff date, Lino token holders can choose to convert their Lino tokens

66
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,920
to BTT based off the average 24-hour market price on Poloniex exchange.

67
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:55,720
So okay, since Lino was just a massively inflated token given value only by Dlive's investors,

68
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,480
and the BitTorrent token is actually a crypto, they were offering some method of exchange

69
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,680
up until the April 14th cutoff.

70
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,480
Fair enough, that actually sounds pretty good.

71
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,640
That was for non-American Lino holders, here it is for the States.

72
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,100
Dlive, the foundation's partner, will accept Lino for the purchase of Lemons on the Dlive

73
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,100
platform.

74
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,420
Lemons is a fixed value platform currency used in Dlive and can only be used to make

75
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,520
purchases and donations on the Dlive platform.

76
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,380
Lemons are basically like the Twitch bits.

77
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,980
On Twitch you can spend money to get bits, donate bits to streamers, and then only streamers

78
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,620
can take donated bits and convert that back into money.

79
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,000
And it's in those conversions between money to bits to money that Twitch takes their cut

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
off the top.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,940
So if you were a viewer who had a bunch of Lino, your only option if you were an American

82
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,680
was to basically cash out into Lemons and then donate them to somebody.

83
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,320
If you were a streamer and you had a bunch of Lemons, you could still use the get paid

84
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,820
function to convert those Lemons into actual money, but what would you do with your Lino?

85
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,920
It really sounds like here that even as a streamer you could only take those Lino, convert

86
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,940
them into Lemons, and then give them to somebody else.

87
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,920
What happens to the Lino blockchain and Lino coin and stake after the migration on April

88
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
15th?

89
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,920
Beginning January 15th at 10pm, Lino blockchain validators will implement an upgrade that

90
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,580
allows all Lino stake to be staked out in one day.

91
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,620
That's better than three months.

92
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,980
This means all stakes that have been processed before this time and after this time will

93
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,420
all be staked out into Lino within one day.

94
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,100
For those Lino account holders who wish to retain their Lino stake, staking rewards are

95
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,460
expected to continue functioning until the cut off time.

96
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,700
There haven't ever been any real staking rewards, by the way.

97
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,400
The Foundation strongly recommends that all Lino stakeholders stake out before the cut

98
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,460
off time.

99
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,500
After the cut off time, the Foundation will no longer support the Lino blockchain and

100
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,460
Lino coin or Lino stake.

101
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,500
There is no assurance that Lino tokens can be transferred or that there is any value

102
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,640
or functionality in the Lino blockchain after the cut off time.

103
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,140
So basically, DLive was dropping Lino and switching over to BitTorrent's ecosystem.

104
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,820
The Lino network and the Lino currency associated with it was going to be completely destroyed.

105
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,740
Something known as, I think, coin burning.

106
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:11,240
I'm not completely up on the whole crypto thing, but basically it was no longer going

107
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,960
to be a usable currency and they were offering through a crypto exchange known as Poloniex.com

108
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,720
to transfer your Lino into BTT and then presumably you could take that BTT and sell it on Poloniex

109
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,600
and get dollars like you always would.

110
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:32,120
From what I've been able to find, the exchange rate from Lino to BTT and then from BTT to

111
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,500
dollars is approximately the same as the old exchange rate of directly cashing out

112
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,260
your Lino into dollars using DLive's get paid button.

113
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,500
So really, the only people who got seriously burned here are the people who were like die-hard

114
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,840
DLive fans, the ones that thought that this was the future and Lino was going to be a

115
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
big thing.

116
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
No, it was just abandoned.

117
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,300
And really, the only way you got hurt is through your ego.

118
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,380
It's not like people are losing tons of money, are they?

119
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,220
Well firstly, even though Lino is now a dead network and a dead currency, the site is still

120
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:08,200
and you can still create a wallet and give them money for a currency that no longer exists.

121
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,000
Maybe this site should go down, guys.

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,200
Although it still has PewDiePie on it, so I guess they're just not paying attention

123
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
anymore.

124
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,200
But there were a few big draws of DLive back when they were really pushing it.

125
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,020
One, it was the claim that they were supposedly decentralized.

126
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:25,960
And two, that somehow through this roundabout Lino system, DLive wasn't taking a cut.

127
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,920
And this fellow named Eric Wilson on his blog ran the math and realized that's no longer

128
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,160
the case now that they're over on Tron.

129
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,720
After BTT staking is enabled on DLive, streamers will get less of a percentage than on Twitch.

130
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,740
And I think on Twitch they already get half or something?

131
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,260
I didn't know anything about Tron, so I literally had to start at the ground floor.

132
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,060
Friends that I greatly respect showed immediate concerns.

133
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,180
I played the wait and see game.

134
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,300
I absolutely believe that DLive would have folded if it weren't for Justin Sun.

135
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,900
Remember that name, Justin Sun.

136
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,900
They called it a partnership, but he bought them out and kept them afloat.

137
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,480
So in a way it is sort of a, what does the community have to lose?

138
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,360
Apparently what they have to lose is 15% more of their donations.

139
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,560
And here's the spreadsheet.

140
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,720
On Twitch, for 100 bits, which is worth $1 to a streamer, you pay $1.40 and it seems

141
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,320
like Twitch gets a cut of 40 cents.

142
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,920
So it's like 33% or 30% or something.

143
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,520
I know Twitch takes a 50% cut when it comes to the sub button via the monthly Twitch subs,

144
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,040
but when it comes to bits, it seems to be a little bit different.

145
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:36,580
However, over on DLive, 88 lemons, which is worth $1.06, costs $1.53.

146
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:42,220
There's taxes, but then there's also something called a donation tax, as well as DLive's

147
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,820
cut of 74 cents.

148
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,640
And the streamer only gets to withdraw 79 cents.

149
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,540
So DLive's old claim that they don't take a cut just isn't true anymore.

150
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,500
In fact, the cut they take is bigger.

151
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,860
Initially they ran everything on the lino testnet.

152
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,140
Your lino points could be staked.

153
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,380
It was an easy calculation.

154
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:02,920
Every time someone donated, 9.9% of the donation went towards the community staked pot.

155
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,320
What you received from stake rewards depended on the daily pot, how much total was staked,

156
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,920
and how much you had staked.

157
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,000
Basically, your percentage of the total staked gets that percentage of the staked pot.

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,840
This entire time, lino was available to be purchased and sold through the lino network

159
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,000
only for a flat price of 0.012 US dollars.

160
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,680
I would like to add that they paid for their validators through the inflation.

161
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,980
Part of that inflation was also used as content bonuses based on a bunch of math.

162
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,060
Then they changed it.

163
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,740
They wanted to change it to two different coins.

164
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,940
Lino would be now only used for staking and rewards.

165
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,660
And they added lemons as the stable coin and the donation coin of the platform, keeping

166
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,700
the price the same on that.

167
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,740
How it worked was 9.9% of lemon donations were converted to lino to be distributed to

168
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,740
stakeholders.

169
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,000
What happened then was obvious and very predictable.

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,780
This platform was full of streamers.

171
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:00,080
It is very, very top heavy of streamers compared to viewers, having many content creators without

172
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,020
the large content consumption audience.

173
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,960
The reason this is such a big deal is much of the donations were between stakeholders

174
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,200
who were also getting donations and staked rewards.

175
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,320
People were using their staked rewards to donate to other streamers.

176
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,300
Once they changed it to lino and lemons, however, the liquid lemons used to donate were drying

177
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:22,000
up because 9.9% of the lemons were essentially burned and converted to lino every time it

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
was donated, taking the liquidity out of the available donations.

179
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,880
Then the only way you could get more lemons was to be donated them or buy them.

180
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,480
Everyone paying attention could see what was happening.

181
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,760
Donations were slowing down and continued to drop.

182
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,300
I can only assume that when they changed over to lemons, it was their hope that purchases

183
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,040
of lemons would outpace their need to pay for servers and paying out to streamers.

184
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,980
I felt, even then when things were sort of exciting, the end was near.

185
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,140
Several articles from over a year ago where people asked Charles Wayne, one of the guys

186
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,520
behind this whole thing, how he planned for this operation to be profitable, he basically

187
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,420
said that in the short term he didn't.

188
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,540
He wanted to focus on massive short term growth in order to attract an investor that would

189
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,780
hopefully buy his company.

190
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,260
And as we can see, this was the logical end result of that.

191
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,400
They basically started running out of money.

192
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,020
But now that the percentage of donations that went to staking rewards was up from 9.9% to

193
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,400
25%, that is more money for the community.

194
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,560
No it's not.

195
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,200
That's more money for BTT holders, which very likely is mostly Justin's son.

196
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,040
BTT has been available for over a year.

197
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,640
BTT holders are largely outside the platform.

198
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,840
And this next little bit here is from the BTT whitepaper.

199
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:37,840
BTT token issuance, we will create a total supply of 99 trillion BTT.

200
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,240
Public sale tokens constitute 6% of total token supply.

201
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,060
Private sale tokens constitute 2% of total token supply.

202
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:49,940
Bittorrent team and the Bittorrent foundation were at 19%, the Tron foundation got 20%,

203
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:55,520
the Bittorrent ecosystem is allocated 19%, and partnership tokens constitute 4%.

204
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,900
So basically, as the Lino token was being spread around and people were starting to

205
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,840
get more and more of it, they decided to switch to this previously created token system where

206
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:09,060
a large chunk of the token is owned by some select insiders.

207
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,580
Including Justin's son.

208
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,380
Imagine growing your brand on Dlive, thinking you're a whale and then this happens.

209
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,300
If you were in the United States during the conversion, you had to do KYC verification

210
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,820
and cash out.

211
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:26,240
If you were outside of the country, you had to use Justin's son's Poloniex exchange

212
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,860
to get your BTT.

213
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,440
And that's the rub, isn't it?

214
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,740
Justin's son owns Poloniex.com, the only exchange that allowed you to transfer your

215
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,980
Lino out into something resembling real currency.

216
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:42,660
So yeah, if you were a Dlive streamer between January and April of this year, if you were

217
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,820
in the US, you'd do KYC verification and cash out.

218
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,660
If you were outside the US, you had to use Justin's son's exchange site to transfer

219
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:56,240
your Lino into Justin's son's BTT and then try to cash that out into real money.

220
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,860
And all those people who didn't do it on time, well, that money was just lost.

221
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,640
It was simply kept by Dlive and most likely kept by Justin's son since he's the one

222
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,780
who bought them out.

223
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,980
The amount of Lino converted compared to the amount of BTT already out there is a drop

224
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,080
in the bucket.

225
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,780
There is no way the Dlive community is going to get any sort of majority of rewards with

226
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,100
this.

227
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,820
This is further centralization and protection.

228
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:24,780
So this blog post is talking more about the centralized versus decentralized part of the

229
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,380
argument when it comes to Dlive.

230
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,700
And fair enough, this is further centralization and protection.

231
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,420
And it completely goes against the Dlive that we were all sold.

232
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,860
However, personally, I'm a bit more interested in the part of the conversation where Justin

233
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,620
sunlines his own pockets.

234
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:43,020
Here's a testimonial by somebody who, during the actual proper cash out period for Lino,

235
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,880
was trying to do just that.

236
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,220
They forced us to lock our Lino points in.

237
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,140
I literally just put in a request to unlock my Lino a month ago and now suddenly the Lino

238
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,760
isn't worth anything.

239
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,380
It claims on that page you can buy lemons with Lino, but this functionality doesn't

240
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,980
actually exist.

241
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,820
His website was just one giant scam.

242
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,500
No different than a pump and dump.

243
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,400
They got a bunch of people to give them money for worthless Lino by paying off PewDiePie

244
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,300
and using his fanbase.

245
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,980
And they just literally kept all the money and turned Lino into a worthless crypto that

246
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,580
you have to convert into some other crypto now.

247
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,180
And that does sound like what I predicted they would do about a year ago.

248
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,680
They were going to blow smoke up everybody's ass about Lino, get people to drop a whole

249
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,580
bunch of money on it, and then basically run away with it.

250
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,940
Of course, there were ways, at least during the grace period, to turn your Lino into another

251
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,260
usable crypto.

252
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:38,860
But it was convoluted, and it involved Justin Sun taking multiple cuts and fees every step

253
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,860
of the way.

254
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,020
The thing is, though, this isn't the first time this has happened, and I don't mean

255
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,160
just with Steemit.

256
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,480
October of last year, decentralized streaming platform Dlive partners with the Theta network

257
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,020
to engage users with token rewards.

258
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,340
How many companies and blockchains and ecosystems is Dlive going to go through?

259
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,460
The truth is, this was always going to happen.

260
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,620
At some point, the people behind Dlive were going to pull the rug out from everyone else.

261
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,380
What they did wasn't illegal.

262
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,740
What would be illegal, at least according to current laws regarding crypto, is if they

263
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:15,080
unilaterally massively devalued Lino, right before their acquisition by BitTorrent, basically

264
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,800
leaving everyone who had money in Lino high and dry.

265
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,380
They didn't quite do that.

266
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,800
That would have been the best way for them to scam the maximum amount of money, but it

267
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,060
also probably would have got them shut down.

268
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,880
So they did the next best thing.

269
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,340
They set it up so that Lino would become valueless.

270
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:35,820
Oh, and by the way, you can still give them money for their useless token after the value

271
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,140
has been set to zero for some dumb reason.

272
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,940
And everyone who has Lino, well, you just have to transfer over to this new token that

273
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,100
they've got going.

274
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,100
Of course, the transfer will have a minor fee, don't worry about it.

275
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,780
I wonder if in a year or two's time, assuming Dlive is still around, if they transfer away

276
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:55,920
from the BitTorrent ecosystem to another blockchain, will there be another transfer fee?

277
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,760
Will you once again have to use the owner of the company's proprietary software or something

278
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,680
to make the transfer and there's a charge associated with that as well?

279
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,720
This isn't a scam, but it is like on the very edge of being a scam.

280
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,100
People are still getting paid on this site, even though it's at this point quite dead

281
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,920
now that PewDiePie's off of it.

282
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,680
But you're jumping through hoops, you're losing money along the way, cuts and skims off the

283
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,720
top are coming left, right, and center.

284
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,880
And despite their initial promise of we don't take any of your money, Dlive's actually worse

285
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,480
than the big names when it comes to this sort of stuff.

286
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,920
And you know, I don't think that PewDiePie actually knew about this.

287
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:41,440
I think he just likes the idea of some kind of streaming service or a video service or

288
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,240
something that's not YouTube, because YouTube is frankly pretty shit nowadays, and he took

289
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,640
a chance on Dlive.

290
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,560
Of course he took a chance because they offered him a big bucket full of money, but nonetheless

291
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,560
he took a chance on Dlive.

292
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,000
I don't think PewDiePie was being malicious, I just think he was being kind of dumb.

293
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,920
No offense to the guy personally, I like his videos.

294
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,280
And I think this because he's done it before.

295
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:06,240
Here's a video of PewDiePie promoting S-Game Pro, a mobile games platform where users can

296
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,280
mine their crypto by just playing the games on the platform.

297
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,240
It too turned out to be a scam.

298
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:22,400
So listen up people, PewDiePie is going to tell you about S-Game Pro, a wonderful place

299
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:32,740
where you can mine crypto tokens just by playing some of the world's most popular mobile games.

300
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,800
Play mine urn.

301
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,920
Players log into the platform to chat, stream and complete PVP games.

302
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,080
Winners get rewarded with highly liquid ERC20 crypto tokens.

303
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:50,620
You can exchange SGM for other cryptos, use it to shop in the online store, get gift cards

304
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,880
or cash it in for real life money.

305
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,600
Plus the total supply of SGM is capped at 350 million and 139 million is already sold.

306
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,120
So it's pretty popular already.

307
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,680
Play mine urn with S-Game Pro.

308
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,160
You know, I'm not Pewds, obviously.

309
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,360
I'm sure he has a better idea of how to run his business than I ever would.

310
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,420
But as an outsider looking in, as a little guy with no clout whatsoever, it really seems

311
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,780
like unless he's intentionally ripping people off, and I don't think he is, he needs to

312
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,600
pay a little bit more attention to what he promotes.

313
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,360
Because in so far as decentralized platforms are concerned, he's batting zero for two.

314
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,880
A lot of these people, Justin Sun, Charles Wayne, everyone behind Lino and Tron and Dlive,

315
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,260
a lot of them are Chinese nationals who moved to the United States to go to school.

316
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,480
That's not a problem in and of itself, but they've all taken Chinese money.

317
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,660
All of their projects have gone through multiple funding rounds coming from Chinese angel investors

318
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,460
and venture capitalists.

319
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,820
And that means somewhere along the line, the PRC is involved.

320
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,120
And at least to me, that is absolutely unacceptable.

321
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,400
Anyway, with PewDiePie gone, Dlive is dying.
