00:00.000 --> 00:09.100
In 2022, Netflix released a movie titled White Noise.

00:09.100 --> 00:12.820
Based on the 1985 novel of the same name, the film is about a small town in Ohio that

00:12.820 --> 00:17.200
suffers from a cataclysmic environmental accident caused by a train derailment, which casts

00:17.200 --> 00:19.980
a huge cloud of toxic chemicals across the landscape.

00:19.980 --> 00:23.900
And then one year later in 2023, in real life, it actually happened.

00:23.900 --> 00:26.900
Keep in mind that a lot of the stuff I'm going to be covering today isn't exactly

00:26.900 --> 00:27.980
fully confirmed.

00:27.980 --> 00:29.620
New information may come out later.

00:29.620 --> 00:31.900
I'm just going to be presenting to you what I've dug up.

00:31.900 --> 00:37.480
On February 3rd, 2023, a train owned by the Norfolk Southern Corporation derailed in the

00:37.480 --> 00:39.520
town of East Palestine, Ohio.

00:39.520 --> 00:44.400
Nobody was hurt in the initial event, but approximately 50 of the 141 cars came off

00:44.400 --> 00:49.000
the tracks, with 20 of them containing hazardous chemicals, 14 of them specifically containing

00:49.000 --> 00:50.500
vinyl chloride.

00:50.500 --> 00:54.680
Initial reporting of the event by the legacy media downplayed the possible danger of chemical

00:54.680 --> 00:58.320
contamination, instead opting to focus on how quickly Norfolk Southern managed to get

00:58.320 --> 00:59.900
services up and running again.

00:59.900 --> 01:03.420
Nonetheless, the Environmental Protection Agency was on the scene, monitoring the air

01:03.420 --> 01:04.420
and water.

01:04.420 --> 01:08.300
By February 5th, authorities noticed a temperature change in one of the cars, and believed that

01:08.300 --> 01:10.580
an explosion was imminent in the next few days.

01:10.580 --> 01:14.920
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine ordered an evacuation of the area, and the next day, February 6th,

01:14.920 --> 01:19.200
the remaining five tanks of vinyl chloride underwent a controlled release and burn.

01:19.200 --> 01:22.320
This does mean that the chemicals were burnt and expelled into the atmosphere, but it was

01:22.320 --> 01:26.340
meant to prevent an even larger disaster of an uncontrolled explosion.

01:26.340 --> 01:28.200
However, there was a problem.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.060
Here's the projected contamination map of the town.

01:30.060 --> 01:34.700
It turns out the actual contamination was significantly wider, like three states and

01:34.700 --> 01:36.640
parts of southern Canada wider.

01:36.640 --> 01:41.140
By February 7th, meteorologists had noticed that a weather phenomenon known as an inversion

01:41.140 --> 01:43.860
layer had trapped the chemicals, preventing them from dispersing.

01:43.860 --> 01:47.860
Normally, air temperature decreases as altitude increases, but sometimes, due to natural weather

01:47.860 --> 01:50.340
cycles, warmer air is held above cooler air.

01:50.340 --> 01:53.300
This is what causes smog to linger in a city sometimes, for example.

01:53.300 --> 01:56.860
When an inversion layer is finally broken due to shifting pressure, it often results

01:56.860 --> 01:57.860
in a thunderstorm.

01:57.860 --> 02:00.800
This is kind of like how in summer it's often really muggy, and then after you get

02:00.800 --> 02:03.200
a day of rain, it's hot and dry afterward.

02:03.200 --> 02:07.040
Basically, inversions are completely normal and common, but in East Palestine, it had

02:07.040 --> 02:08.800
catastrophic consequences.

02:08.800 --> 02:13.140
The dark clouds of vinyl chloride and other chemicals were trapped lower to the ground

02:13.140 --> 02:15.040
and more concentrated than they should have been.

02:15.040 --> 02:19.400
We're now over a week after the burn, and the chemical cloud continues to linger, covering

02:19.400 --> 02:24.040
areas within Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, with minor amounts being detected

02:24.040 --> 02:27.580
as far as Detroit and Toronto as the weather pushes the cloud north.

02:27.580 --> 02:30.520
That being said, it also has significantly diminished over time.

02:30.520 --> 02:34.680
The EPA recorded an increase in volatile organic compounds in the air, as well as an increase

02:34.680 --> 02:37.480
in particulate matter, across February 7th and 8th.

02:37.480 --> 02:40.900
Norfolk Southern also began cleanup operations of affected water and soil.

02:40.900 --> 02:45.600
The EPA lifted the evacuation order on February 9th, claiming that the air inside the evacuation

02:45.600 --> 02:49.500
zone had returned to normal levels, and that the drinking water was tested to be safe.

02:49.500 --> 02:53.480
The EPA only found contamination within that initial zone east of town.

02:53.480 --> 02:58.220
Furthermore, 210 homes have been tested, at the request of residents, by both Norfolk

02:58.220 --> 03:00.820
and the EPA, and all tests have come back negative.

03:00.820 --> 03:03.320
However, people on the ground aren't convinced.

03:03.320 --> 03:06.780
There are reports coming from residents in the town, with photo and video, all showing

03:06.780 --> 03:07.780
the same thing.

03:07.780 --> 03:12.300
Lots of dead fish and frogs in the creeks around town, waterways layered with a strange,

03:12.300 --> 03:17.040
white foam-like chemical, reports of both pets and livestock suffering serious illness

03:17.040 --> 03:21.380
or death after remaining outside for a period of time, as well as a strange taste and smell

03:21.380 --> 03:22.480
in the air.

03:22.480 --> 03:26.540
Residents are also noticing these trucks driving around, handling these incidents, from a company

03:26.540 --> 03:30.780
called EnviroScience, which specializes in time-sensitive environmental cleanup.

03:30.780 --> 03:34.980
Now, it's not like there's anything shady about Ohio employing companies like EnviroScience.

03:34.980 --> 03:36.940
That's exactly what you'd want to see happen.

03:36.940 --> 03:40.340
But it does make the claim of, everything's fine here, there's no contamination, ring

03:40.340 --> 03:42.580
a little bit hollow from a layman's perspective.

03:42.580 --> 03:46.860
Plus, the fact that the EPA said, there's no contamination, go home, while at the same

03:46.860 --> 03:51.060
time, the Ohio Department of Health's director urged people with private wells to have that

03:51.060 --> 03:52.440
water tested.

03:52.440 --> 04:00.420
We have strongly encouraged all of those people on private wells to get their wells tested

04:00.420 --> 04:03.760
and that will be done at no cost to them.

04:03.760 --> 04:09.520
This is something that is part of the remediation and it's very important for the reasons I

04:09.520 --> 04:10.520
just described.

04:10.520 --> 04:15.060
Now, it's obvious to me that the reason owners of private water sources are being asked to

04:15.060 --> 04:19.080
get them tested is because the government can't test everything unprompted.

04:19.080 --> 04:22.860
But to your average person, it's understandable why they'd have some reservations when the

04:22.860 --> 04:26.200
official messaging doesn't seem to line up with their own experiences.

04:26.200 --> 04:30.600
By February 14th, we had learned that significantly more chemicals had been spilled by the disaster

04:30.600 --> 04:32.280
than was initially estimated.

04:32.280 --> 04:36.780
Towns outside the evacuation zone began to experience the same smells and tastes in the

04:36.780 --> 04:40.660
air and local waterways that feed into the Ohio River, which remember feeds into the

04:40.660 --> 04:43.200
Mississippi River, have confirmed to be contaminated.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.380
The EPA claims that despite these dramatic reports from local people, they haven't noticed

04:47.380 --> 04:50.640
a significant rise in the numbers of dead fish, and their containment efforts have kept

04:50.640 --> 04:54.460
most of the pollution out of the Ohio River, keeping it within the local watershed.

04:54.460 --> 04:58.400
However, news on the ground interviewed a local firefighter and hazardous materials

04:58.400 --> 05:01.900
specialist who believes that the whole thing has been handled improperly.

05:01.900 --> 05:06.640
We basically nuked the town with chemicals so we could get a railroad open.

05:06.640 --> 05:11.200
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sent a letter to Norfolk Southern stating that

05:11.200 --> 05:16.940
ethylene glycomonobutyl ether, ethylexyl acrylate, and isobutylene were also in the

05:16.940 --> 05:20.220
rail cars that were derailed, breached, or on fire.

05:20.220 --> 05:23.780
Caggiano says ethylexyl acrylate is especially worrisome.

05:23.780 --> 05:27.700
He says it's a carcinogen, and contact with it can cause burning and irritation in the

05:27.700 --> 05:32.900
skin and eyes, breathing it in can irritate the nose, throat, and cause coughing and shortness

05:32.900 --> 05:34.620
of breath.

05:34.620 --> 05:38.540
Isobutylene is also known to cause dizziness and drowsiness when inhaled.

05:38.540 --> 05:45.420
I was kind of surprised when they quickly told the people they can go back home, but

05:45.420 --> 05:51.460
then said if they feel like they want their homes tested, they can have them tested.

05:51.460 --> 05:54.260
I would have far rather they did all the testing.

05:54.260 --> 05:58.660
Caggiano says it's possible some of these chemicals could still be present in homes

05:58.660 --> 06:01.100
and on objects until you clean them thoroughly.

06:01.100 --> 06:06.300
There's a lot of what ifs, and we're going to be looking at this thing 5, 10, 15, 20

06:06.300 --> 06:11.580
years down the line and wondering, gee, cancer clusters could pop up, you know, well water

06:11.580 --> 06:12.580
could go bad.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.980
Here's a quick rundown on the dangers of these chemicals.

06:14.980 --> 06:18.260
Exposure to the main chemical, vinyl chloride, seems to be quite awful.

06:18.260 --> 06:22.140
Brief exposure of 300 parts per million causes liver damage in humans.

06:22.140 --> 06:26.940
An experiment that exposed rats to 250 parts per million for 4 hours resulted in liver

06:26.940 --> 06:27.940
cancer.

06:27.940 --> 06:31.380
OSHA defines the permissible exposure limit for vinyl chloride to be 1 part per million

06:31.380 --> 06:36.260
for 8 hours a day, and 5 parts per million is only permissible for 15 minutes a day.

06:36.260 --> 06:40.960
We don't know the exposure level of vinyl chloride in the area yet, but the EPA is claiming

06:40.960 --> 06:43.400
it's not above 1 part per million.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.520
The choice to burn the vinyl chloride was, initially, a good one.

06:46.520 --> 06:50.060
It would have allowed the chemical to rise into the air and dilute, if not held in place

06:50.060 --> 06:51.060
by an induction layer.

06:51.060 --> 06:53.320
And it's not like they could have helped the weather, because the tanks were about

06:53.320 --> 06:54.320
to blow anyway.

06:54.320 --> 06:55.320
There's nothing else they could do.

06:55.320 --> 06:59.840
But more importantly, burning vinyl chloride turns it into two other compounds, CO2 and

06:59.840 --> 07:01.040
hydrogen chloride.

07:01.040 --> 07:04.460
We all know what CO2 is, we breathe it out, and it's also a common greenhouse gas.

07:04.460 --> 07:05.800
But hydrogen chloride is tricky.

07:05.800 --> 07:09.600
It's dangerous at high levels on its own, but the worst danger in this scenario is when

07:09.600 --> 07:12.860
it comes into contact with water, it turns into hydrochloric acid.

07:12.860 --> 07:15.420
This is the chemical that your stomach digests food with.

07:15.420 --> 07:18.640
At high enough concentrations, it can dissolve stone and metal.

07:18.640 --> 07:22.700
If the EPA is wrong, and there actually is more dead wildlife and pets and livestock

07:22.700 --> 07:26.900
than usual, it's entirely possible it's going to be because of hydrogen chloride reacting

07:26.900 --> 07:31.100
with water in the river, killing the fish and frogs, and reacting with water in or on

07:31.100 --> 07:33.380
plants, killing animals who come into contact with it.

07:33.380 --> 07:37.020
There is at least one report of somebody who drove through a rainstorm in the affected

07:37.020 --> 07:40.300
area and claimed that the water eroded part of their car.

07:40.300 --> 07:43.940
Now, there are some kooks out there who are claiming that this whole thing is deliberate,

07:43.940 --> 07:48.020
that Biden is dragging his feet to help Ohio because the affected area is heavily voted

07:48.020 --> 07:49.020
for Trump.

07:49.020 --> 07:50.980
That's a fun conspiracy theory, but there's no proof of it.

07:50.980 --> 07:54.780
It's the same thing that leftoids accused George Bush of with regards to Hurricane Katrina

07:54.780 --> 07:56.700
relief though, so I guess what goes around comes around.

07:56.700 --> 08:00.460
There's also people saying that the affected area is one of the few locations that Vanguard,

08:00.460 --> 08:04.340
BlackRock, and JP Morgan hasn't been able to take control of the land yet, so this is

08:04.340 --> 08:08.460
a plan by the New World Order to make the area uninhabitable to advance the Great Reset

08:08.460 --> 08:09.460
and the New Normal.

08:09.620 --> 08:12.540
Again, there's no proof of that either, and there likely never will be, because that's

08:12.540 --> 08:14.700
some insane tinfoil hat bullshit.

08:14.700 --> 08:17.500
Part of the conspiracy theory surrounding this whole event stemmed from the fact that

08:17.500 --> 08:20.660
a journalist was arrested for reporting on it on the ground in Ohio.

08:20.660 --> 08:24.120
This made the rounds on rightoid Twitter, fueling the conspiracy further that the left-wing

08:24.120 --> 08:27.580
federal government was more than happy to suppress this story and let the people of

08:27.580 --> 08:29.940
the heartland burn to death in acid rain or something.

08:29.940 --> 08:31.720
But again, that's not the full story.

08:31.720 --> 08:35.940
What actually happened was Evan Lambert, a reporter for NewsNation, was arrested during

08:35.940 --> 08:38.700
a press conference because he disrupted it by arguing.

08:38.740 --> 08:39.740
Continue to argue.

08:39.740 --> 08:40.740
Excuse me.

08:40.740 --> 08:41.740
Now.

08:41.740 --> 08:42.740
Go.

08:42.740 --> 08:43.740
Now.

08:43.740 --> 08:44.740
Or you can go to jail.

08:44.740 --> 08:45.740
Sir.

08:45.740 --> 08:46.740
You want to go to jail for criminal trespassing?

08:46.740 --> 08:47.740
I'm trying to listen.

08:47.740 --> 08:48.740
Do you want to go to jail for criminal trespassing?

08:48.740 --> 08:49.740
Please.

08:49.740 --> 08:50.740
Do you understand?

08:50.740 --> 08:51.740
You know how quickly our lawyers will get me up?

08:51.740 --> 08:52.740
I don't care.

08:52.740 --> 08:53.740
We don't care.

08:53.740 --> 08:54.740
Sorry, can we talk?

08:54.740 --> 08:55.740
I don't care.

08:55.740 --> 08:56.740
Just talk outside.

08:56.740 --> 08:57.740
Let's talk outside.

08:57.740 --> 08:58.740
Go.

08:58.740 --> 08:59.740
Let's talk outside.

08:59.740 --> 09:00.740
Come on.

09:00.740 --> 09:01.740
Out the doors.

09:01.740 --> 09:02.740
Out the doors.

09:02.740 --> 09:03.740
You're invited by other media right now.

09:03.740 --> 09:04.740
I don't care.

09:04.740 --> 09:05.740
I'm going to listen.

09:05.740 --> 09:06.740
I don't care.

09:06.740 --> 09:07.740
You're going to walk out the door.

09:07.780 --> 09:08.780
I'm the building supervisor here.

09:08.780 --> 09:09.780
Please leave.

09:09.780 --> 09:10.780
There you have it.

09:10.780 --> 09:11.780
You're going to stand outside.

09:11.780 --> 09:12.780
Or you're going to jail.

09:12.780 --> 09:13.780
Let's go.

09:13.780 --> 09:14.780
Let's go.

09:14.780 --> 09:15.780
Come on.

09:15.780 --> 09:16.780
Out.

09:16.780 --> 09:17.780
Out.

09:17.780 --> 09:18.780
How are you?

09:18.780 --> 09:19.780
Out the door.

09:19.780 --> 09:20.780
You're under arrest.

09:20.780 --> 09:21.780
Oh, I'm under arrest.

09:21.780 --> 09:22.780
Excuse me, sir.

09:22.780 --> 09:23.780
Oh, sir.

09:23.780 --> 09:24.780
Oh my God.

09:24.780 --> 09:25.780
You guys, this is bad.

09:25.780 --> 09:26.780
Stop.

09:26.780 --> 09:27.780
I'm on the ground.

09:27.780 --> 09:28.780
What are you trying to do?

09:28.780 --> 09:29.780
Okay.

09:29.780 --> 09:30.780
Stop.

09:30.780 --> 09:31.780
Stop.

09:31.780 --> 09:32.780
Stop.

09:32.780 --> 09:33.780
Stop.

09:33.780 --> 09:34.780
Stop.

09:34.780 --> 09:35.780
Stop.

09:35.780 --> 09:36.780
Stop.

09:36.820 --> 09:37.820
Stop resisting.

09:37.820 --> 09:38.820
Stop resisting.

09:38.820 --> 09:39.820
Stop resisting.

09:39.820 --> 09:40.820
Stop resisting.

09:40.820 --> 09:41.820
Stop resisting.

09:41.820 --> 09:42.820
Stop resisting.

09:42.820 --> 09:43.820
Stop resisting.

09:43.820 --> 09:44.820
Stop resisting.

09:44.820 --> 09:45.820
Stop resisting.

09:45.820 --> 09:46.820
This is what it's like to be a Black reporter in 2023.

09:46.820 --> 09:47.820
Evan, I'm so sorry.

09:47.820 --> 09:48.820
Evan, I'm sorry.

09:48.820 --> 09:49.820
Thank you, see you.

09:49.820 --> 09:50.820
Court records show he was charged with resisting arrest and criminal trespass for refusing

09:50.820 --> 09:53.280
police officers who told him to calm down and later get out as he continued to disrupt

09:53.280 --> 09:54.280
the event.

09:54.280 --> 09:58.840
In fact, the video showing his arrest shows other reporters who did not disrupt the event

09:58.840 --> 10:03.300
covering the arrest as well as the other journalists back at the press conference who didn't get

10:03.300 --> 10:04.300
arrested.

10:04.300 --> 10:08.140
case that Lambert was not actually arrested for trying to reveal the truth, though I'm

10:08.140 --> 10:10.100
sure that'll be a great bump to his career.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.460
Instead, he was arrested for being an asshat.

10:12.460 --> 10:15.060
However, there is a political angle that we can discuss here.

10:15.060 --> 10:19.660
Pete Buttigieg, the Biden administration's transportation secretary, spent his time during

10:19.660 --> 10:24.420
this disaster talking about how there's too many white males in blue collar jobs.

10:24.420 --> 10:31.100
To work with your contractors, to work with your community colleges on building a workforce

10:31.100 --> 10:33.120
that reflects the community.

10:33.120 --> 10:39.000
We have heard way too many stories from generations past of infrastructure where you got a neighborhood,

10:39.000 --> 10:42.600
often a neighborhood of color, that finally sees the project come to them, but everyone

10:42.600 --> 10:48.160
in the hardhats on that project looking like, you know, doing the good paying jobs, don't

10:48.160 --> 10:50.840
look like they came from anywhere near the neighborhood.

10:50.840 --> 10:56.420
You can build community wealth that will help close wealth gaps in this country.

10:56.420 --> 11:00.520
He had nothing to say about it until February 13th, even though it's clearly within his

11:00.520 --> 11:01.520
jurisdiction.

11:01.520 --> 11:06.160
Some people are attempting to blame President Biden because back on December 2nd, 2022,

11:06.160 --> 11:11.000
he signed legislation to stop a strike of railroad unions by forcing on them an employment

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
contract.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.320
However, that specific strike was not over railroad safety, but instead over paid sick

11:16.320 --> 11:17.320
days.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.920
And it doesn't seem likely that railroad safety would have been affected had the strike

11:19.920 --> 11:21.400
been able to go through.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.960
Railroad safety is an important part of this conversation, though, because of how the train

11:24.960 --> 11:26.440
derailed in the first place.

11:26.440 --> 11:30.360
The National Transportation Safety Board discovered that the derailment was caused by a mechanical

11:30.360 --> 11:33.280
issue on one of the rail car's axles.

11:33.280 --> 11:37.000
Surveillance footage of the rail line showed that 20 miles before the disaster, one of

11:37.000 --> 11:38.640
the axles was on fire.

11:38.640 --> 11:39.640
Let's rewind a bit.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.000
November 30th, 2012.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.820
The same thing happened, this time in New Jersey, a derailed train carrying vinyl chloride.

11:45.820 --> 11:49.220
This time, though, there was no problems with temperature or flames, and a burn-off was

11:49.220 --> 11:50.220
not necessary.

11:50.220 --> 11:52.960
They simply had to drain the tankers and physically haul them away.

11:52.960 --> 11:57.260
But in response, the Obama administration made it a priority in 2014 to regulate the

11:57.260 --> 11:58.860
railways for additional safety.

11:58.860 --> 12:03.500
A key component of their plan was requiring companies to implement a newer, more effective,

12:03.500 --> 12:07.500
but more costly braking system that could be activated in a pinch to stop trains more

12:07.500 --> 12:10.700
quickly and possibly prevent or minimize a derailment.

12:10.700 --> 12:15.380
They're called ECP brakes, or electronically controlled pneumatic brakes.

12:15.380 --> 12:20.640
The current braking system used on trains was first invented in 1868, and it's remained

12:20.640 --> 12:22.100
more or less intact.

12:22.100 --> 12:27.320
The conductor controls the flow of air into and out of the brake pipe from the locomotive,

12:27.320 --> 12:30.840
and as the pressure moves through the system, the train's brakes activate.

12:30.840 --> 12:35.920
Therefore, it can take up to two minutes for a long train to fully slam the brakes, because

12:35.920 --> 12:38.640
air pressure through the pneumatic system has to move.

12:38.640 --> 12:43.320
However, ECP brakes are set up that each car has its own system, and they are activated

12:43.320 --> 12:45.400
all at the same time electronically.

12:45.400 --> 12:50.080
This provides better train control, it shortens the stopping distance of a train, and it also

12:50.080 --> 12:54.740
leads to a much lower risk of derailing the train as all of the cars brake at the same

12:54.740 --> 12:58.820
time, rather than the front cars braking and the back cars still moving the same speed.

12:58.820 --> 13:03.780
Here's a chart of railway corporation donations to both Republican and Democratic candidates.

13:03.780 --> 13:07.100
Sometimes the donations are about even, but during cycles where Democrats have talked

13:07.100 --> 13:11.040
about regulating railways, like for example during Bill Clinton's second term or during

13:11.040 --> 13:15.700
the Bush years, railway companies tend to donate three to four times more money to Republicans.

13:15.700 --> 13:17.220
And it was no different under Obama.

13:17.220 --> 13:19.980
In 2008 and 2010, it's even.

13:19.980 --> 13:24.040
By 2012, though, when the New Jersey accident happened, the money flows to the right again.

13:24.040 --> 13:28.420
In September of 2018, railway companies with Norfolk Southern at the forefront successfully

13:28.420 --> 13:33.000
lobbied the Trump administration to reverse the Obama-era decision, requiring trains hauling

13:33.000 --> 13:36.400
hazardous materials to implement ECP brakes.

13:36.400 --> 13:40.600
The corpos claim was that it would cost them more than $3 billion to implement the new

13:40.600 --> 13:42.380
brakes, a cost that they could not afford.

13:42.380 --> 13:46.800
The rule change was first tossed around during a December 2017 Department of Transportation

13:46.800 --> 13:51.240
meeting, where Republican Senator John Thurn, the chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce,

13:51.240 --> 13:55.120
Science, and Transportation at the time, said publicly that repealing this rule puts

13:55.120 --> 14:00.200
sound science and careful study by the independent National Academies of Sciences and Government

14:00.200 --> 14:04.020
Accountability Office over the flawed guesswork used in 2015.

14:04.020 --> 14:08.200
While new technologies offer potential improvement to railroad safety, regulators have a responsibility

14:08.200 --> 14:12.840
to fairly evaluate effectiveness and avoid arbitrarily mandating new requirements.

14:12.840 --> 14:16.520
I applaud the department's new leadership for reacting appropriately to the findings

14:16.520 --> 14:18.820
of independent experts and fixing a mistake.

14:18.820 --> 14:22.860
It's possible that the new crop of Republican lawmakers, who may have been influenced by

14:22.860 --> 14:27.740
campaign donations, decided at the behest of private industry to re-look at the Obama-era

14:27.740 --> 14:33.220
regulations requiring ECP brakes on trains hauling hazardous materials.

14:33.220 --> 14:37.760
During this December 2017 meeting, which led to the September 2018 repeal, these Republican

14:37.760 --> 14:42.340
lawmakers cited this paper as proof that the regulation was not necessary.

14:42.340 --> 14:46.380
Published by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog body meant

14:46.380 --> 14:50.460
to keep the executive branch in check on October 12, 2016.

14:50.460 --> 14:54.220
The Department of Transportation's rulemaking on electronically controlled pneumatic brakes

14:54.220 --> 14:57.100
could benefit from additional data and transparency.

14:57.100 --> 15:01.680
The paper claims that the Department of Transportation oversold the effectiveness of ECP braking

15:01.680 --> 15:04.460
and that there is not enough data on their effectiveness.

15:04.460 --> 15:08.860
The paper claims that the Department of Transportation's studies and figures regarding this effectiveness

15:08.860 --> 15:13.380
could not be reliably replicated by private scientists and engineers working for these

15:13.380 --> 15:14.380
corporations.

15:14.380 --> 15:18.360
That being said, other countries like Canada, Japan, Australia, as well as countries across

15:18.360 --> 15:22.120
the EU, have employed ECP brakes to positive effect.

15:22.120 --> 15:25.860
And it is generally believed to be an improvement on safety outside of America.

15:25.860 --> 15:28.900
Though the corporations are correct, it is costly to implement.

15:28.900 --> 15:32.980
Nonetheless, when Republicans took power in 2016, they leaned on this paper to advocate

15:32.980 --> 15:35.800
for the removal of the ECP brake requirements.

15:35.800 --> 15:39.760
And Trump ordered the Department of Transportation to implement the rollback in 2018.

15:39.760 --> 15:43.140
This is all common knowledge but not really known about outside of these circles.

15:43.140 --> 15:46.540
Harvard has a comprehensive timeline of the political back and forth regarding the regulation

15:46.540 --> 15:49.220
and then later the repeal surrounding ECP brakes.

15:49.220 --> 15:53.540
And a letter written by the leader of the Railroad Workers Union to President Biden

15:53.540 --> 15:58.780
makes a passing reference to the rejection of ECP braking as a problem within his industry.

15:58.780 --> 16:03.140
It's too early to know if the situation would have truly been helped if American trains

16:03.140 --> 16:06.220
had ECP brakes like the rest of the developed world.

16:06.220 --> 16:10.580
But considering that one of the trains' axles was on fire 20 miles before the crash,

16:10.580 --> 16:15.000
which investigators cite as the primary reason for the derailment, it is certainly possible

16:15.000 --> 16:18.500
that better brakes could have brought the train to a halt quicker and more effectively

16:18.500 --> 16:20.500
before the disaster got any worse.

16:20.500 --> 16:24.540
In fact, a former Federal Railroad Administration official personally believes that this is

16:24.540 --> 16:28.900
the case, that this accident could have been largely mitigated with ECP brakes.

16:28.900 --> 16:31.340
If that's true, then we have several culprits here.

16:31.340 --> 16:34.620
We've got railroad corporations who have fought necessary regulation of their industry

16:34.620 --> 16:38.820
tooth and nail, and who have refused to voluntarily implement the safety procedures themselves,

16:38.820 --> 16:42.140
instead opting to use their profits to conduct stock buybacks.

16:42.140 --> 16:46.500
We've got Trump, who repealed the Obama-era regulation, and any Republicans who supported him.

16:46.500 --> 16:49.420
And we've got Biden, who failed to re-implement the regulation.

16:49.420 --> 16:52.660
Though considering how much is on Biden's plate right now, and how his brain seems to

16:52.660 --> 16:56.060
be literally leaking out of his ears sometimes, I'm not surprised he didn't remember that

16:56.060 --> 16:57.060
this was an issue.

16:57.060 --> 17:00.220
But surely other Democrats did, and they also failed to act.

17:00.220 --> 17:03.860
Hopefully, now that this shit show is underway, they'll stop forgetting and actually do

17:03.860 --> 17:05.420
something about this.

17:05.420 --> 17:07.420
America is the most developed country in the world.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.860
There's no need for you guys to be fucking things up this badly.

17:09.860 --> 17:13.500
Yeah, I know that Libertarians are going to re until the cows come home about regulation,

17:13.500 --> 17:14.500
but I don't want to hear it.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.500
The corpos fucked up.

17:15.500 --> 17:16.500
The Democrats fucked up.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.580
And the Republicans fucked up.

17:17.580 --> 17:20.260
And not just establishment ones, but Trump too.

17:20.260 --> 17:24.920
If investigations turn out that ECP brakes would have prevented this disaster, then everyone

17:24.920 --> 17:26.180
here is culpable.

17:26.180 --> 17:30.260
I literally grew up right down the road from East Palestine.

17:30.260 --> 17:34.920
My old childhood best friend lives in the fucking town.

17:34.920 --> 17:38.960
My current best friend literally lives right next to the town.

17:38.960 --> 17:44.880
It is so much worse than what the media is telling any of us.

17:44.880 --> 17:51.560
I'm getting reports from people that are down there right now, that they're literally seeing

17:51.560 --> 17:57.760
schools of fish floating down streams, rivers, fucking dead.

17:57.760 --> 18:03.140
I got a video from my friend, okay, and she's like walking.

18:03.140 --> 18:08.820
It's all fucking dead, all fucking dead, and on the top of the water is a really pretty

18:08.820 --> 18:10.820
chemical rainbow sheen.

18:10.820 --> 18:15.820
The chemicals are in the fucking water and they're lying to the rest of the country saying

18:15.820 --> 18:16.820
they're not.

18:16.820 --> 18:23.780
The water's been contaminated, the soil's been contaminated, the fucking air is contaminated.

18:23.780 --> 18:30.120
You literally are about to see some of the worst fucking health side effects coming out

18:30.120 --> 18:31.500
of people in that town.

18:31.500 --> 18:35.420
It's not even funny, and y'all want to know something even more fucked up?

18:35.420 --> 18:41.020
The restaurant that I work at, in a whole different state, had to donate food to them

18:41.020 --> 18:48.180
because we had people from the churches calling to tell us that Red Cross never fucking came,

18:48.180 --> 18:54.060
FEMA never fucking came, the environmental conservationists still have yet to fucking

18:54.060 --> 18:59.620
come, and nobody's fucking helping them, meaning all of the fucking firefighters that were

18:59.620 --> 19:04.160
working get no food, have nothing to help them, nothing, okay?

19:04.160 --> 19:09.340
All the people that were displaced have no food, water, a place to stay, none of that

19:09.340 --> 19:10.340
shit.

19:10.340 --> 19:13.580
It is so much worse than what they're telling you, and TikTok probably won't even let me

19:13.580 --> 19:18.320
post this video, but if this video gets posted, please save it and repost it everywhere you

19:18.320 --> 19:22.940
fucking can, because I'm telling y'all, they are covering this shit up.

19:22.940 --> 19:27.420
They are covering this shit up because they don't want to get in on how bad it actually

19:27.420 --> 19:28.420
was.

19:28.420 --> 19:29.420
This was not good.

19:29.420 --> 19:32.940
This was the worst fucking thing that's happened probably in the past eight years.
