0	9100	In 2022, Netflix released a movie titled White Noise.
9100	12820	Based on the 1985 novel of the same name, the film is about a small town in Ohio that
12820	17200	suffers from a cataclysmic environmental accident caused by a train derailment, which casts
17200	19980	a huge cloud of toxic chemicals across the landscape.
19980	23900	And then one year later in 2023, in real life, it actually happened.
23900	26900	Keep in mind that a lot of the stuff I'm going to be covering today isn't exactly
26900	27980	fully confirmed.
27980	29620	New information may come out later.
29620	31900	I'm just going to be presenting to you what I've dug up.
31900	37480	On February 3rd, 2023, a train owned by the Norfolk Southern Corporation derailed in the
37480	39520	town of East Palestine, Ohio.
39520	44400	Nobody was hurt in the initial event, but approximately 50 of the 141 cars came off
44400	49000	the tracks, with 20 of them containing hazardous chemicals, 14 of them specifically containing
49000	50500	vinyl chloride.
50500	54680	Initial reporting of the event by the legacy media downplayed the possible danger of chemical
54680	58320	contamination, instead opting to focus on how quickly Norfolk Southern managed to get
58320	59900	services up and running again.
59900	63420	Nonetheless, the Environmental Protection Agency was on the scene, monitoring the air
63420	64420	and water.
64420	68300	By February 5th, authorities noticed a temperature change in one of the cars, and believed that
68300	70580	an explosion was imminent in the next few days.
70580	74920	Ohio Governor Mike DeWine ordered an evacuation of the area, and the next day, February 6th,
74920	79200	the remaining five tanks of vinyl chloride underwent a controlled release and burn.
79200	82320	This does mean that the chemicals were burnt and expelled into the atmosphere, but it was
82320	86340	meant to prevent an even larger disaster of an uncontrolled explosion.
86340	88200	However, there was a problem.
88200	90060	Here's the projected contamination map of the town.
90060	94700	It turns out the actual contamination was significantly wider, like three states and
94700	96640	parts of southern Canada wider.
96640	101140	By February 7th, meteorologists had noticed that a weather phenomenon known as an inversion
101140	103860	layer had trapped the chemicals, preventing them from dispersing.
103860	107860	Normally, air temperature decreases as altitude increases, but sometimes, due to natural weather
107860	110340	cycles, warmer air is held above cooler air.
110340	113300	This is what causes smog to linger in a city sometimes, for example.
113300	116860	When an inversion layer is finally broken due to shifting pressure, it often results
116860	117860	in a thunderstorm.
117860	120800	This is kind of like how in summer it's often really muggy, and then after you get
120800	123200	a day of rain, it's hot and dry afterward.
123200	127040	Basically, inversions are completely normal and common, but in East Palestine, it had
127040	128800	catastrophic consequences.
128800	133140	The dark clouds of vinyl chloride and other chemicals were trapped lower to the ground
133140	135040	and more concentrated than they should have been.
135040	139400	We're now over a week after the burn, and the chemical cloud continues to linger, covering
139400	144040	areas within Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, with minor amounts being detected
144040	147580	as far as Detroit and Toronto as the weather pushes the cloud north.
147580	150520	That being said, it also has significantly diminished over time.
150520	154680	The EPA recorded an increase in volatile organic compounds in the air, as well as an increase
154680	157480	in particulate matter, across February 7th and 8th.
157480	160900	Norfolk Southern also began cleanup operations of affected water and soil.
160900	165600	The EPA lifted the evacuation order on February 9th, claiming that the air inside the evacuation
165600	169500	zone had returned to normal levels, and that the drinking water was tested to be safe.
169500	173480	The EPA only found contamination within that initial zone east of town.
173480	178220	Furthermore, 210 homes have been tested, at the request of residents, by both Norfolk
178220	180820	and the EPA, and all tests have come back negative.
180820	183320	However, people on the ground aren't convinced.
183320	186780	There are reports coming from residents in the town, with photo and video, all showing
186780	187780	the same thing.
187780	192300	Lots of dead fish and frogs in the creeks around town, waterways layered with a strange,
192300	197040	white foam-like chemical, reports of both pets and livestock suffering serious illness
197040	201380	or death after remaining outside for a period of time, as well as a strange taste and smell
201380	202480	in the air.
202480	206540	Residents are also noticing these trucks driving around, handling these incidents, from a company
206540	210780	called EnviroScience, which specializes in time-sensitive environmental cleanup.
210780	214980	Now, it's not like there's anything shady about Ohio employing companies like EnviroScience.
214980	216940	That's exactly what you'd want to see happen.
216940	220340	But it does make the claim of, everything's fine here, there's no contamination, ring
220340	222580	a little bit hollow from a layman's perspective.
222580	226860	Plus, the fact that the EPA said, there's no contamination, go home, while at the same
226860	231060	time, the Ohio Department of Health's director urged people with private wells to have that
231060	232440	water tested.
232440	240420	We have strongly encouraged all of those people on private wells to get their wells tested
240420	243760	and that will be done at no cost to them.
243760	249520	This is something that is part of the remediation and it's very important for the reasons I
249520	250520	just described.
250520	255060	Now, it's obvious to me that the reason owners of private water sources are being asked to
255060	259080	get them tested is because the government can't test everything unprompted.
259080	262860	But to your average person, it's understandable why they'd have some reservations when the
262860	266200	official messaging doesn't seem to line up with their own experiences.
266200	270600	By February 14th, we had learned that significantly more chemicals had been spilled by the disaster
270600	272280	than was initially estimated.
272280	276780	Towns outside the evacuation zone began to experience the same smells and tastes in the
276780	280660	air and local waterways that feed into the Ohio River, which remember feeds into the
280660	283200	Mississippi River, have confirmed to be contaminated.
283200	287380	The EPA claims that despite these dramatic reports from local people, they haven't noticed
287380	290640	a significant rise in the numbers of dead fish, and their containment efforts have kept
290640	294460	most of the pollution out of the Ohio River, keeping it within the local watershed.
294460	298400	However, news on the ground interviewed a local firefighter and hazardous materials
298400	301900	specialist who believes that the whole thing has been handled improperly.
301900	306640	We basically nuked the town with chemicals so we could get a railroad open.
306640	311200	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sent a letter to Norfolk Southern stating that
311200	316940	ethylene glycomonobutyl ether, ethylexyl acrylate, and isobutylene were also in the
316940	320220	rail cars that were derailed, breached, or on fire.
320220	323780	Caggiano says ethylexyl acrylate is especially worrisome.
323780	327700	He says it's a carcinogen, and contact with it can cause burning and irritation in the
327700	332900	skin and eyes, breathing it in can irritate the nose, throat, and cause coughing and shortness
332900	334620	of breath.
334620	338540	Isobutylene is also known to cause dizziness and drowsiness when inhaled.
338540	345420	I was kind of surprised when they quickly told the people they can go back home, but
345420	351460	then said if they feel like they want their homes tested, they can have them tested.
351460	354260	I would have far rather they did all the testing.
354260	358660	Caggiano says it's possible some of these chemicals could still be present in homes
358660	361100	and on objects until you clean them thoroughly.
361100	366300	There's a lot of what ifs, and we're going to be looking at this thing 5, 10, 15, 20
366300	371580	years down the line and wondering, gee, cancer clusters could pop up, you know, well water
371580	372580	could go bad.
372580	374980	Here's a quick rundown on the dangers of these chemicals.
374980	378260	Exposure to the main chemical, vinyl chloride, seems to be quite awful.
378260	382140	Brief exposure of 300 parts per million causes liver damage in humans.
382140	386940	An experiment that exposed rats to 250 parts per million for 4 hours resulted in liver
386940	387940	cancer.
387940	391380	OSHA defines the permissible exposure limit for vinyl chloride to be 1 part per million
391380	396260	for 8 hours a day, and 5 parts per million is only permissible for 15 minutes a day.
396260	400960	We don't know the exposure level of vinyl chloride in the area yet, but the EPA is claiming
400960	403400	it's not above 1 part per million.
403400	406520	The choice to burn the vinyl chloride was, initially, a good one.
406520	410060	It would have allowed the chemical to rise into the air and dilute, if not held in place
410060	411060	by an induction layer.
411060	413320	And it's not like they could have helped the weather, because the tanks were about
413320	414320	to blow anyway.
414320	415320	There's nothing else they could do.
415320	419840	But more importantly, burning vinyl chloride turns it into two other compounds, CO2 and
419840	421040	hydrogen chloride.
421040	424460	We all know what CO2 is, we breathe it out, and it's also a common greenhouse gas.
424460	425800	But hydrogen chloride is tricky.
425800	429600	It's dangerous at high levels on its own, but the worst danger in this scenario is when
429600	432860	it comes into contact with water, it turns into hydrochloric acid.
432860	435420	This is the chemical that your stomach digests food with.
435420	438640	At high enough concentrations, it can dissolve stone and metal.
438640	442700	If the EPA is wrong, and there actually is more dead wildlife and pets and livestock
442700	446900	than usual, it's entirely possible it's going to be because of hydrogen chloride reacting
446900	451100	with water in the river, killing the fish and frogs, and reacting with water in or on
451100	453380	plants, killing animals who come into contact with it.
453380	457020	There is at least one report of somebody who drove through a rainstorm in the affected
457020	460300	area and claimed that the water eroded part of their car.
460300	463940	Now, there are some kooks out there who are claiming that this whole thing is deliberate,
463940	468020	that Biden is dragging his feet to help Ohio because the affected area is heavily voted
468020	469020	for Trump.
469020	470980	That's a fun conspiracy theory, but there's no proof of it.
470980	474780	It's the same thing that leftoids accused George Bush of with regards to Hurricane Katrina
474780	476700	relief though, so I guess what goes around comes around.
476700	480460	There's also people saying that the affected area is one of the few locations that Vanguard,
480460	484340	BlackRock, and JP Morgan hasn't been able to take control of the land yet, so this is
484340	488460	a plan by the New World Order to make the area uninhabitable to advance the Great Reset
488460	489460	and the New Normal.
489620	492540	Again, there's no proof of that either, and there likely never will be, because that's
492540	494700	some insane tinfoil hat bullshit.
494700	497500	Part of the conspiracy theory surrounding this whole event stemmed from the fact that
497500	500660	a journalist was arrested for reporting on it on the ground in Ohio.
500660	504120	This made the rounds on rightoid Twitter, fueling the conspiracy further that the left-wing
504120	507580	federal government was more than happy to suppress this story and let the people of
507580	509940	the heartland burn to death in acid rain or something.
509940	511720	But again, that's not the full story.
511720	515940	What actually happened was Evan Lambert, a reporter for NewsNation, was arrested during
515940	518700	a press conference because he disrupted it by arguing.
518740	519740	Continue to argue.
519740	520740	Excuse me.
520740	521740	Now.
521740	522740	Go.
522740	523740	Now.
523740	524740	Or you can go to jail.
524740	525740	Sir.
525740	526740	You want to go to jail for criminal trespassing?
526740	527740	I'm trying to listen.
527740	528740	Do you want to go to jail for criminal trespassing?
528740	529740	Please.
529740	530740	Do you understand?
530740	531740	You know how quickly our lawyers will get me up?
531740	532740	I don't care.
532740	533740	We don't care.
533740	534740	Sorry, can we talk?
534740	535740	I don't care.
535740	536740	Just talk outside.
536740	537740	Let's talk outside.
537740	538740	Go.
538740	539740	Let's talk outside.
539740	540740	Come on.
540740	541740	Out the doors.
541740	542740	Out the doors.
542740	543740	You're invited by other media right now.
543740	544740	I don't care.
544740	545740	I'm going to listen.
545740	546740	I don't care.
546740	547740	You're going to walk out the door.
547780	548780	I'm the building supervisor here.
548780	549780	Please leave.
549780	550780	There you have it.
550780	551780	You're going to stand outside.
551780	552780	Or you're going to jail.
552780	553780	Let's go.
553780	554780	Let's go.
554780	555780	Come on.
555780	556780	Out.
556780	557780	Out.
557780	558780	How are you?
558780	559780	Out the door.
559780	560780	You're under arrest.
560780	561780	Oh, I'm under arrest.
561780	562780	Excuse me, sir.
562780	563780	Oh, sir.
563780	564780	Oh my God.
564780	565780	You guys, this is bad.
565780	566780	Stop.
566780	567780	I'm on the ground.
567780	568780	What are you trying to do?
568780	569780	Okay.
569780	570780	Stop.
570780	571780	Stop.
571780	572780	Stop.
572780	573780	Stop.
573780	574780	Stop.
574780	575780	Stop.
575780	576780	Stop.
576820	577820	Stop resisting.
577820	578820	Stop resisting.
578820	579820	Stop resisting.
579820	580820	Stop resisting.
580820	581820	Stop resisting.
581820	582820	Stop resisting.
582820	583820	Stop resisting.
583820	584820	Stop resisting.
584820	585820	Stop resisting.
585820	586820	This is what it's like to be a Black reporter in 2023.
586820	587820	Evan, I'm so sorry.
587820	588820	Evan, I'm sorry.
588820	589820	Thank you, see you.
589820	590820	Court records show he was charged with resisting arrest and criminal trespass for refusing
590820	593280	police officers who told him to calm down and later get out as he continued to disrupt
593280	594280	the event.
594280	598840	In fact, the video showing his arrest shows other reporters who did not disrupt the event
598840	603300	covering the arrest as well as the other journalists back at the press conference who didn't get
603300	604300	arrested.
604300	608140	case that Lambert was not actually arrested for trying to reveal the truth, though I'm
608140	610100	sure that'll be a great bump to his career.
610100	612460	Instead, he was arrested for being an asshat.
612460	615060	However, there is a political angle that we can discuss here.
615060	619660	Pete Buttigieg, the Biden administration's transportation secretary, spent his time during
619660	624420	this disaster talking about how there's too many white males in blue collar jobs.
624420	631100	To work with your contractors, to work with your community colleges on building a workforce
631100	633120	that reflects the community.
633120	639000	We have heard way too many stories from generations past of infrastructure where you got a neighborhood,
639000	642600	often a neighborhood of color, that finally sees the project come to them, but everyone
642600	648160	in the hardhats on that project looking like, you know, doing the good paying jobs, don't
648160	650840	look like they came from anywhere near the neighborhood.
650840	656420	You can build community wealth that will help close wealth gaps in this country.
656420	660520	He had nothing to say about it until February 13th, even though it's clearly within his
660520	661520	jurisdiction.
661520	666160	Some people are attempting to blame President Biden because back on December 2nd, 2022,
666160	671000	he signed legislation to stop a strike of railroad unions by forcing on them an employment
671000	672000	contract.
672000	676320	However, that specific strike was not over railroad safety, but instead over paid sick
676320	677320	days.
677320	679920	And it doesn't seem likely that railroad safety would have been affected had the strike
679920	681400	been able to go through.
681400	684960	Railroad safety is an important part of this conversation, though, because of how the train
684960	686440	derailed in the first place.
686440	690360	The National Transportation Safety Board discovered that the derailment was caused by a mechanical
690360	693280	issue on one of the rail car's axles.
693280	697000	Surveillance footage of the rail line showed that 20 miles before the disaster, one of
697000	698640	the axles was on fire.
698640	699640	Let's rewind a bit.
699640	701000	November 30th, 2012.
701000	705820	The same thing happened, this time in New Jersey, a derailed train carrying vinyl chloride.
705820	709220	This time, though, there was no problems with temperature or flames, and a burn-off was
709220	710220	not necessary.
710220	712960	They simply had to drain the tankers and physically haul them away.
712960	717260	But in response, the Obama administration made it a priority in 2014 to regulate the
717260	718860	railways for additional safety.
718860	723500	A key component of their plan was requiring companies to implement a newer, more effective,
723500	727500	but more costly braking system that could be activated in a pinch to stop trains more
727500	730700	quickly and possibly prevent or minimize a derailment.
730700	735380	They're called ECP brakes, or electronically controlled pneumatic brakes.
735380	740640	The current braking system used on trains was first invented in 1868, and it's remained
740640	742100	more or less intact.
742100	747320	The conductor controls the flow of air into and out of the brake pipe from the locomotive,
747320	750840	and as the pressure moves through the system, the train's brakes activate.
750840	755920	Therefore, it can take up to two minutes for a long train to fully slam the brakes, because
755920	758640	air pressure through the pneumatic system has to move.
758640	763320	However, ECP brakes are set up that each car has its own system, and they are activated
763320	765400	all at the same time electronically.
765400	770080	This provides better train control, it shortens the stopping distance of a train, and it also
770080	774740	leads to a much lower risk of derailing the train as all of the cars brake at the same
774740	778820	time, rather than the front cars braking and the back cars still moving the same speed.
778820	783780	Here's a chart of railway corporation donations to both Republican and Democratic candidates.
783780	787100	Sometimes the donations are about even, but during cycles where Democrats have talked
787100	791040	about regulating railways, like for example during Bill Clinton's second term or during
791040	795700	the Bush years, railway companies tend to donate three to four times more money to Republicans.
795700	797220	And it was no different under Obama.
797220	799980	In 2008 and 2010, it's even.
799980	804040	By 2012, though, when the New Jersey accident happened, the money flows to the right again.
804040	808420	In September of 2018, railway companies with Norfolk Southern at the forefront successfully
808420	813000	lobbied the Trump administration to reverse the Obama-era decision, requiring trains hauling
813000	816400	hazardous materials to implement ECP brakes.
816400	820600	The corpos claim was that it would cost them more than $3 billion to implement the new
820600	822380	brakes, a cost that they could not afford.
822380	826800	The rule change was first tossed around during a December 2017 Department of Transportation
826800	831240	meeting, where Republican Senator John Thurn, the chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce,
831240	835120	Science, and Transportation at the time, said publicly that repealing this rule puts
835120	840200	sound science and careful study by the independent National Academies of Sciences and Government
840200	844020	Accountability Office over the flawed guesswork used in 2015.
844020	848200	While new technologies offer potential improvement to railroad safety, regulators have a responsibility
848200	852840	to fairly evaluate effectiveness and avoid arbitrarily mandating new requirements.
852840	856520	I applaud the department's new leadership for reacting appropriately to the findings
856520	858820	of independent experts and fixing a mistake.
858820	862860	It's possible that the new crop of Republican lawmakers, who may have been influenced by
862860	867740	campaign donations, decided at the behest of private industry to re-look at the Obama-era
867740	873220	regulations requiring ECP brakes on trains hauling hazardous materials.
873220	877760	During this December 2017 meeting, which led to the September 2018 repeal, these Republican
877760	882340	lawmakers cited this paper as proof that the regulation was not necessary.
882340	886380	Published by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog body meant
886380	890460	to keep the executive branch in check on October 12, 2016.
890460	894220	The Department of Transportation's rulemaking on electronically controlled pneumatic brakes
894220	897100	could benefit from additional data and transparency.
897100	901680	The paper claims that the Department of Transportation oversold the effectiveness of ECP braking
901680	904460	and that there is not enough data on their effectiveness.
904460	908860	The paper claims that the Department of Transportation's studies and figures regarding this effectiveness
908860	913380	could not be reliably replicated by private scientists and engineers working for these
913380	914380	corporations.
914380	918360	That being said, other countries like Canada, Japan, Australia, as well as countries across
918360	922120	the EU, have employed ECP brakes to positive effect.
922120	925860	And it is generally believed to be an improvement on safety outside of America.
925860	928900	Though the corporations are correct, it is costly to implement.
928900	932980	Nonetheless, when Republicans took power in 2016, they leaned on this paper to advocate
932980	935800	for the removal of the ECP brake requirements.
935800	939760	And Trump ordered the Department of Transportation to implement the rollback in 2018.
939760	943140	This is all common knowledge but not really known about outside of these circles.
943140	946540	Harvard has a comprehensive timeline of the political back and forth regarding the regulation
946540	949220	and then later the repeal surrounding ECP brakes.
949220	953540	And a letter written by the leader of the Railroad Workers Union to President Biden
953540	958780	makes a passing reference to the rejection of ECP braking as a problem within his industry.
958780	963140	It's too early to know if the situation would have truly been helped if American trains
963140	966220	had ECP brakes like the rest of the developed world.
966220	970580	But considering that one of the trains' axles was on fire 20 miles before the crash,
970580	975000	which investigators cite as the primary reason for the derailment, it is certainly possible
975000	978500	that better brakes could have brought the train to a halt quicker and more effectively
978500	980500	before the disaster got any worse.
980500	984540	In fact, a former Federal Railroad Administration official personally believes that this is
984540	988900	the case, that this accident could have been largely mitigated with ECP brakes.
988900	991340	If that's true, then we have several culprits here.
991340	994620	We've got railroad corporations who have fought necessary regulation of their industry
994620	998820	tooth and nail, and who have refused to voluntarily implement the safety procedures themselves,
998820	1002140	instead opting to use their profits to conduct stock buybacks.
1002140	1006500	We've got Trump, who repealed the Obama-era regulation, and any Republicans who supported him.
1006500	1009420	And we've got Biden, who failed to re-implement the regulation.
1009420	1012660	Though considering how much is on Biden's plate right now, and how his brain seems to
1012660	1016060	be literally leaking out of his ears sometimes, I'm not surprised he didn't remember that
1016060	1017060	this was an issue.
1017060	1020220	But surely other Democrats did, and they also failed to act.
1020220	1023860	Hopefully, now that this shit show is underway, they'll stop forgetting and actually do
1023860	1025420	something about this.
1025420	1027420	America is the most developed country in the world.
1027420	1029860	There's no need for you guys to be fucking things up this badly.
1029860	1033500	Yeah, I know that Libertarians are going to re until the cows come home about regulation,
1033500	1034500	but I don't want to hear it.
1034500	1035500	The corpos fucked up.
1035500	1036500	The Democrats fucked up.
1036500	1037580	And the Republicans fucked up.
1037580	1040260	And not just establishment ones, but Trump too.
1040260	1044920	If investigations turn out that ECP brakes would have prevented this disaster, then everyone
1044920	1046180	here is culpable.
1046180	1050260	I literally grew up right down the road from East Palestine.
1050260	1054920	My old childhood best friend lives in the fucking town.
1054920	1058960	My current best friend literally lives right next to the town.
1058960	1064880	It is so much worse than what the media is telling any of us.
1064880	1071560	I'm getting reports from people that are down there right now, that they're literally seeing
1071560	1077760	schools of fish floating down streams, rivers, fucking dead.
1077760	1083140	I got a video from my friend, okay, and she's like walking.
1083140	1088820	It's all fucking dead, all fucking dead, and on the top of the water is a really pretty
1088820	1090820	chemical rainbow sheen.
1090820	1095820	The chemicals are in the fucking water and they're lying to the rest of the country saying
1095820	1096820	they're not.
1096820	1103780	The water's been contaminated, the soil's been contaminated, the fucking air is contaminated.
1103780	1110120	You literally are about to see some of the worst fucking health side effects coming out
1110120	1111500	of people in that town.
1111500	1115420	It's not even funny, and y'all want to know something even more fucked up?
1115420	1121020	The restaurant that I work at, in a whole different state, had to donate food to them
1121020	1128180	because we had people from the churches calling to tell us that Red Cross never fucking came,
1128180	1134060	FEMA never fucking came, the environmental conservationists still have yet to fucking
1134060	1139620	come, and nobody's fucking helping them, meaning all of the fucking firefighters that were
1139620	1144160	working get no food, have nothing to help them, nothing, okay?
1144160	1149340	All the people that were displaced have no food, water, a place to stay, none of that
1149340	1150340	shit.
1150340	1153580	It is so much worse than what they're telling you, and TikTok probably won't even let me
1153580	1158320	post this video, but if this video gets posted, please save it and repost it everywhere you
1158320	1162940	fucking can, because I'm telling y'all, they are covering this shit up.
1162940	1167420	They are covering this shit up because they don't want to get in on how bad it actually
1167420	1168420	was.
1168420	1169420	This was not good.
1169420	1172940	This was the worst fucking thing that's happened probably in the past eight years.
