00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,100
In 2022, Netflix released a movie titled White Noise.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,820
Based on the 1985 novel of the same name, the film is about a small town in Ohio that

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,200
suffers from a cataclysmic environmental accident caused by a train derailment, which casts

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,980
a huge cloud of toxic chemicals across the landscape.

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,900
And then one year later in 2023, in real life, it actually happened.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,900
Keep in mind that a lot of the stuff I'm going to be covering today isn't exactly

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,980
fully confirmed.

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,620
New information may come out later.

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,900
I'm just going to be presenting to you what I've dug up.

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,480
On February 3rd, 2023, a train owned by the Norfolk Southern Corporation derailed in the

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,520
town of East Palestine, Ohio.

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,400
Nobody was hurt in the initial event, but approximately 50 of the 141 cars came off

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,000
the tracks, with 20 of them containing hazardous chemicals, 14 of them specifically containing

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,500
vinyl chloride.

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,680
Initial reporting of the event by the legacy media downplayed the possible danger of chemical

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,320
contamination, instead opting to focus on how quickly Norfolk Southern managed to get

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,900
services up and running again.

18
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,420
Nonetheless, the Environmental Protection Agency was on the scene, monitoring the air

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,420
and water.

20
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,300
By February 5th, authorities noticed a temperature change in one of the cars, and believed that

21
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,580
an explosion was imminent in the next few days.

22
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,920
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine ordered an evacuation of the area, and the next day, February 6th,

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,200
the remaining five tanks of vinyl chloride underwent a controlled release and burn.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,320
This does mean that the chemicals were burnt and expelled into the atmosphere, but it was

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,340
meant to prevent an even larger disaster of an uncontrolled explosion.

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,200
However, there was a problem.

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,060
Here's the projected contamination map of the town.

28
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,700
It turns out the actual contamination was significantly wider, like three states and

29
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,640
parts of southern Canada wider.

30
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,140
By February 7th, meteorologists had noticed that a weather phenomenon known as an inversion

31
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,860
layer had trapped the chemicals, preventing them from dispersing.

32
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,860
Normally, air temperature decreases as altitude increases, but sometimes, due to natural weather

33
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,340
cycles, warmer air is held above cooler air.

34
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,300
This is what causes smog to linger in a city sometimes, for example.

35
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,860
When an inversion layer is finally broken due to shifting pressure, it often results

36
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,860
in a thunderstorm.

37
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,800
This is kind of like how in summer it's often really muggy, and then after you get

38
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,200
a day of rain, it's hot and dry afterward.

39
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,040
Basically, inversions are completely normal and common, but in East Palestine, it had

40
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,800
catastrophic consequences.

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,140
The dark clouds of vinyl chloride and other chemicals were trapped lower to the ground

42
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,040
and more concentrated than they should have been.

43
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,400
We're now over a week after the burn, and the chemical cloud continues to linger, covering

44
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,040
areas within Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, with minor amounts being detected

45
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,580
as far as Detroit and Toronto as the weather pushes the cloud north.

46
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,520
That being said, it also has significantly diminished over time.

47
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,680
The EPA recorded an increase in volatile organic compounds in the air, as well as an increase

48
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,480
in particulate matter, across February 7th and 8th.

49
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,900
Norfolk Southern also began cleanup operations of affected water and soil.

50
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,600
The EPA lifted the evacuation order on February 9th, claiming that the air inside the evacuation

51
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,500
zone had returned to normal levels, and that the drinking water was tested to be safe.

52
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,480
The EPA only found contamination within that initial zone east of town.

53
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,220
Furthermore, 210 homes have been tested, at the request of residents, by both Norfolk

54
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,820
and the EPA, and all tests have come back negative.

55
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,320
However, people on the ground aren't convinced.

56
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,780
There are reports coming from residents in the town, with photo and video, all showing

57
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,780
the same thing.

58
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,300
Lots of dead fish and frogs in the creeks around town, waterways layered with a strange,

59
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,040
white foam-like chemical, reports of both pets and livestock suffering serious illness

60
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,380
or death after remaining outside for a period of time, as well as a strange taste and smell

61
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,480
in the air.

62
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,540
Residents are also noticing these trucks driving around, handling these incidents, from a company

63
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,780
called EnviroScience, which specializes in time-sensitive environmental cleanup.

64
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,980
Now, it's not like there's anything shady about Ohio employing companies like EnviroScience.

65
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,940
That's exactly what you'd want to see happen.

66
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,340
But it does make the claim of, everything's fine here, there's no contamination, ring

67
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,580
a little bit hollow from a layman's perspective.

68
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,860
Plus, the fact that the EPA said, there's no contamination, go home, while at the same

69
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,060
time, the Ohio Department of Health's director urged people with private wells to have that

70
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,440
water tested.

71
00:03:52,440 --> 00:04:00,420
We have strongly encouraged all of those people on private wells to get their wells tested

72
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,760
and that will be done at no cost to them.

73
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,520
This is something that is part of the remediation and it's very important for the reasons I

74
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,520
just described.

75
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,060
Now, it's obvious to me that the reason owners of private water sources are being asked to

76
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,080
get them tested is because the government can't test everything unprompted.

77
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,860
But to your average person, it's understandable why they'd have some reservations when the

78
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,200
official messaging doesn't seem to line up with their own experiences.

79
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,600
By February 14th, we had learned that significantly more chemicals had been spilled by the disaster

80
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,280
than was initially estimated.

81
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,780
Towns outside the evacuation zone began to experience the same smells and tastes in the

82
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,660
air and local waterways that feed into the Ohio River, which remember feeds into the

83
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,200
Mississippi River, have confirmed to be contaminated.

84
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,380
The EPA claims that despite these dramatic reports from local people, they haven't noticed

85
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,640
a significant rise in the numbers of dead fish, and their containment efforts have kept

86
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,460
most of the pollution out of the Ohio River, keeping it within the local watershed.

87
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,400
However, news on the ground interviewed a local firefighter and hazardous materials

88
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,900
specialist who believes that the whole thing has been handled improperly.

89
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,640
We basically nuked the town with chemicals so we could get a railroad open.

90
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,200
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sent a letter to Norfolk Southern stating that

91
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,940
ethylene glycomonobutyl ether, ethylexyl acrylate, and isobutylene were also in the

92
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,220
rail cars that were derailed, breached, or on fire.

93
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,780
Caggiano says ethylexyl acrylate is especially worrisome.

94
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,700
He says it's a carcinogen, and contact with it can cause burning and irritation in the

95
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,900
skin and eyes, breathing it in can irritate the nose, throat, and cause coughing and shortness

96
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,620
of breath.

97
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,540
Isobutylene is also known to cause dizziness and drowsiness when inhaled.

98
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:45,420
I was kind of surprised when they quickly told the people they can go back home, but

99
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:51,460
then said if they feel like they want their homes tested, they can have them tested.

100
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,260
I would have far rather they did all the testing.

101
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,660
Caggiano says it's possible some of these chemicals could still be present in homes

102
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,100
and on objects until you clean them thoroughly.

103
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,300
There's a lot of what ifs, and we're going to be looking at this thing 5, 10, 15, 20

104
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,580
years down the line and wondering, gee, cancer clusters could pop up, you know, well water

105
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,580
could go bad.

106
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,980
Here's a quick rundown on the dangers of these chemicals.

107
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,260
Exposure to the main chemical, vinyl chloride, seems to be quite awful.

108
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,140
Brief exposure of 300 parts per million causes liver damage in humans.

109
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,940
An experiment that exposed rats to 250 parts per million for 4 hours resulted in liver

110
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,940
cancer.

111
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,380
OSHA defines the permissible exposure limit for vinyl chloride to be 1 part per million

112
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,260
for 8 hours a day, and 5 parts per million is only permissible for 15 minutes a day.

113
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,960
We don't know the exposure level of vinyl chloride in the area yet, but the EPA is claiming

114
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,400
it's not above 1 part per million.

115
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,520
The choice to burn the vinyl chloride was, initially, a good one.

116
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,060
It would have allowed the chemical to rise into the air and dilute, if not held in place

117
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,060
by an induction layer.

118
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,320
And it's not like they could have helped the weather, because the tanks were about

119
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
to blow anyway.

120
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
There's nothing else they could do.

121
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,840
But more importantly, burning vinyl chloride turns it into two other compounds, CO2 and

122
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,040
hydrogen chloride.

123
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,460
We all know what CO2 is, we breathe it out, and it's also a common greenhouse gas.

124
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,800
But hydrogen chloride is tricky.

125
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,600
It's dangerous at high levels on its own, but the worst danger in this scenario is when

126
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,860
it comes into contact with water, it turns into hydrochloric acid.

127
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,420
This is the chemical that your stomach digests food with.

128
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,640
At high enough concentrations, it can dissolve stone and metal.

129
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,700
If the EPA is wrong, and there actually is more dead wildlife and pets and livestock

130
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,900
than usual, it's entirely possible it's going to be because of hydrogen chloride reacting

131
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,100
with water in the river, killing the fish and frogs, and reacting with water in or on

132
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,380
plants, killing animals who come into contact with it.

133
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,020
There is at least one report of somebody who drove through a rainstorm in the affected

134
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,300
area and claimed that the water eroded part of their car.

135
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,940
Now, there are some kooks out there who are claiming that this whole thing is deliberate,

136
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,020
that Biden is dragging his feet to help Ohio because the affected area is heavily voted

137
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,020
for Trump.

138
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,980
That's a fun conspiracy theory, but there's no proof of it.

139
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,780
It's the same thing that leftoids accused George Bush of with regards to Hurricane Katrina

140
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,700
relief though, so I guess what goes around comes around.

141
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,460
There's also people saying that the affected area is one of the few locations that Vanguard,

142
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,340
BlackRock, and JP Morgan hasn't been able to take control of the land yet, so this is

143
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,460
a plan by the New World Order to make the area uninhabitable to advance the Great Reset

144
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,460
and the New Normal.

145
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,540
Again, there's no proof of that either, and there likely never will be, because that's

146
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,700
some insane tinfoil hat bullshit.

147
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,500
Part of the conspiracy theory surrounding this whole event stemmed from the fact that

148
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,660
a journalist was arrested for reporting on it on the ground in Ohio.

149
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,120
This made the rounds on rightoid Twitter, fueling the conspiracy further that the left-wing

150
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,580
federal government was more than happy to suppress this story and let the people of

151
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,940
the heartland burn to death in acid rain or something.

152
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,720
But again, that's not the full story.

153
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,940
What actually happened was Evan Lambert, a reporter for NewsNation, was arrested during

154
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,700
a press conference because he disrupted it by arguing.

155
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,740
Continue to argue.

156
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,740
Excuse me.

157
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,740
Now.

158
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,740
Go.

159
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,740
Now.

160
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,740
Or you can go to jail.

161
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,740
Sir.

162
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,740
You want to go to jail for criminal trespassing?

163
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,740
I'm trying to listen.

164
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,740
Do you want to go to jail for criminal trespassing?

165
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,740
Please.

166
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,740
Do you understand?

167
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,740
You know how quickly our lawyers will get me up?

168
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,740
I don't care.

169
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,740
We don't care.

170
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,740
Sorry, can we talk?

171
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,740
I don't care.

172
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,740
Just talk outside.

173
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,740
Let's talk outside.

174
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,740
Go.

175
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,740
Let's talk outside.

176
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,740
Come on.

177
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,740
Out the doors.

178
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,740
Out the doors.

179
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,740
You're invited by other media right now.

180
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,740
I don't care.

181
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,740
I'm going to listen.

182
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,740
I don't care.

183
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,740
You're going to walk out the door.

184
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,780
I'm the building supervisor here.

185
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,780
Please leave.

186
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,780
There you have it.

187
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,780
You're going to stand outside.

188
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,780
Or you're going to jail.

189
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,780
Let's go.

190
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,780
Let's go.

191
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,780
Come on.

192
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,780
Out.

193
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,780
Out.

194
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,780
How are you?

195
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,780
Out the door.

196
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,780
You're under arrest.

197
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,780
Oh, I'm under arrest.

198
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,780
Excuse me, sir.

199
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,780
Oh, sir.

200
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,780
Oh my God.

201
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,780
You guys, this is bad.

202
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,780
Stop.

203
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,780
I'm on the ground.

204
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,780
What are you trying to do?

205
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,780
Okay.

206
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,780
Stop.

207
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,780
Stop.

208
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,780
Stop.

209
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,780
Stop.

210
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,780
Stop.

211
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,780
Stop.

212
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,780
Stop.

213
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,820
Stop resisting.

214
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,820
Stop resisting.

215
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,820
Stop resisting.

216
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,820
Stop resisting.

217
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,820
Stop resisting.

218
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,820
Stop resisting.

219
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,820
Stop resisting.

220
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,820
Stop resisting.

221
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,820
Stop resisting.

222
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,820
This is what it's like to be a Black reporter in 2023.

223
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,820
Evan, I'm so sorry.

224
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,820
Evan, I'm sorry.

225
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,820
Thank you, see you.

226
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,820
Court records show he was charged with resisting arrest and criminal trespass for refusing

227
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,280
police officers who told him to calm down and later get out as he continued to disrupt

228
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
the event.

229
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,840
In fact, the video showing his arrest shows other reporters who did not disrupt the event

230
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,300
covering the arrest as well as the other journalists back at the press conference who didn't get

231
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,300
arrested.

232
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,140
case that Lambert was not actually arrested for trying to reveal the truth, though I'm

233
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,100
sure that'll be a great bump to his career.

234
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,460
Instead, he was arrested for being an asshat.

235
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,060
However, there is a political angle that we can discuss here.

236
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,660
Pete Buttigieg, the Biden administration's transportation secretary, spent his time during

237
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,420
this disaster talking about how there's too many white males in blue collar jobs.

238
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:31,100
To work with your contractors, to work with your community colleges on building a workforce

239
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,120
that reflects the community.

240
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,000
We have heard way too many stories from generations past of infrastructure where you got a neighborhood,

241
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,600
often a neighborhood of color, that finally sees the project come to them, but everyone

242
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,160
in the hardhats on that project looking like, you know, doing the good paying jobs, don't

243
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,840
look like they came from anywhere near the neighborhood.

244
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:56,420
You can build community wealth that will help close wealth gaps in this country.

245
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,520
He had nothing to say about it until February 13th, even though it's clearly within his

246
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,520
jurisdiction.

247
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,160
Some people are attempting to blame President Biden because back on December 2nd, 2022,

248
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,000
he signed legislation to stop a strike of railroad unions by forcing on them an employment

249
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
contract.

250
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,320
However, that specific strike was not over railroad safety, but instead over paid sick

251
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
days.

252
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,920
And it doesn't seem likely that railroad safety would have been affected had the strike

253
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,400
been able to go through.

254
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,960
Railroad safety is an important part of this conversation, though, because of how the train

255
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,440
derailed in the first place.

256
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,360
The National Transportation Safety Board discovered that the derailment was caused by a mechanical

257
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,280
issue on one of the rail car's axles.

258
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,000
Surveillance footage of the rail line showed that 20 miles before the disaster, one of

259
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,640
the axles was on fire.

260
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
Let's rewind a bit.

261
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,000
November 30th, 2012.

262
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,820
The same thing happened, this time in New Jersey, a derailed train carrying vinyl chloride.

263
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,220
This time, though, there was no problems with temperature or flames, and a burn-off was

264
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,220
not necessary.

265
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,960
They simply had to drain the tankers and physically haul them away.

266
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,260
But in response, the Obama administration made it a priority in 2014 to regulate the

267
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,860
railways for additional safety.

268
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,500
A key component of their plan was requiring companies to implement a newer, more effective,

269
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,500
but more costly braking system that could be activated in a pinch to stop trains more

270
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,700
quickly and possibly prevent or minimize a derailment.

271
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,380
They're called ECP brakes, or electronically controlled pneumatic brakes.

272
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:20,640
The current braking system used on trains was first invented in 1868, and it's remained

273
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,100
more or less intact.

274
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:27,320
The conductor controls the flow of air into and out of the brake pipe from the locomotive,

275
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,840
and as the pressure moves through the system, the train's brakes activate.

276
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,920
Therefore, it can take up to two minutes for a long train to fully slam the brakes, because

277
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,640
air pressure through the pneumatic system has to move.

278
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,320
However, ECP brakes are set up that each car has its own system, and they are activated

279
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,400
all at the same time electronically.

280
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:50,080
This provides better train control, it shortens the stopping distance of a train, and it also

281
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,740
leads to a much lower risk of derailing the train as all of the cars brake at the same

282
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,820
time, rather than the front cars braking and the back cars still moving the same speed.

283
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,780
Here's a chart of railway corporation donations to both Republican and Democratic candidates.

284
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,100
Sometimes the donations are about even, but during cycles where Democrats have talked

285
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,040
about regulating railways, like for example during Bill Clinton's second term or during

286
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,700
the Bush years, railway companies tend to donate three to four times more money to Republicans.

287
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,220
And it was no different under Obama.

288
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,980
In 2008 and 2010, it's even.

289
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,040
By 2012, though, when the New Jersey accident happened, the money flows to the right again.

290
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,420
In September of 2018, railway companies with Norfolk Southern at the forefront successfully

291
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,000
lobbied the Trump administration to reverse the Obama-era decision, requiring trains hauling

292
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,400
hazardous materials to implement ECP brakes.

293
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,600
The corpos claim was that it would cost them more than $3 billion to implement the new

294
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,380
brakes, a cost that they could not afford.

295
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,800
The rule change was first tossed around during a December 2017 Department of Transportation

296
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,240
meeting, where Republican Senator John Thurn, the chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce,

297
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,120
Science, and Transportation at the time, said publicly that repealing this rule puts

298
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,200
sound science and careful study by the independent National Academies of Sciences and Government

299
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,020
Accountability Office over the flawed guesswork used in 2015.

300
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,200
While new technologies offer potential improvement to railroad safety, regulators have a responsibility

301
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,840
to fairly evaluate effectiveness and avoid arbitrarily mandating new requirements.

302
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,520
I applaud the department's new leadership for reacting appropriately to the findings

303
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,820
of independent experts and fixing a mistake.

304
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,860
It's possible that the new crop of Republican lawmakers, who may have been influenced by

305
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,740
campaign donations, decided at the behest of private industry to re-look at the Obama-era

306
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:33,220
regulations requiring ECP brakes on trains hauling hazardous materials.

307
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,760
During this December 2017 meeting, which led to the September 2018 repeal, these Republican

308
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,340
lawmakers cited this paper as proof that the regulation was not necessary.

309
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,380
Published by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog body meant

310
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,460
to keep the executive branch in check on October 12, 2016.

311
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:54,220
The Department of Transportation's rulemaking on electronically controlled pneumatic brakes

312
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,100
could benefit from additional data and transparency.

313
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,680
The paper claims that the Department of Transportation oversold the effectiveness of ECP braking

314
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,460
and that there is not enough data on their effectiveness.

315
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,860
The paper claims that the Department of Transportation's studies and figures regarding this effectiveness

316
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,380
could not be reliably replicated by private scientists and engineers working for these

317
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,380
corporations.

318
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,360
That being said, other countries like Canada, Japan, Australia, as well as countries across

319
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,120
the EU, have employed ECP brakes to positive effect.

320
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,860
And it is generally believed to be an improvement on safety outside of America.

321
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,900
Though the corporations are correct, it is costly to implement.

322
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,980
Nonetheless, when Republicans took power in 2016, they leaned on this paper to advocate

323
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,800
for the removal of the ECP brake requirements.

324
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,760
And Trump ordered the Department of Transportation to implement the rollback in 2018.

325
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,140
This is all common knowledge but not really known about outside of these circles.

326
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,540
Harvard has a comprehensive timeline of the political back and forth regarding the regulation

327
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,220
and then later the repeal surrounding ECP brakes.

328
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,540
And a letter written by the leader of the Railroad Workers Union to President Biden

329
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,780
makes a passing reference to the rejection of ECP braking as a problem within his industry.

330
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,140
It's too early to know if the situation would have truly been helped if American trains

331
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,220
had ECP brakes like the rest of the developed world.

332
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,580
But considering that one of the trains' axles was on fire 20 miles before the crash,

333
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:15,000
which investigators cite as the primary reason for the derailment, it is certainly possible

334
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,500
that better brakes could have brought the train to a halt quicker and more effectively

335
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
before the disaster got any worse.

336
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,540
In fact, a former Federal Railroad Administration official personally believes that this is

337
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,900
the case, that this accident could have been largely mitigated with ECP brakes.

338
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,340
If that's true, then we have several culprits here.

339
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,620
We've got railroad corporations who have fought necessary regulation of their industry

340
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,820
tooth and nail, and who have refused to voluntarily implement the safety procedures themselves,

341
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,140
instead opting to use their profits to conduct stock buybacks.

342
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,500
We've got Trump, who repealed the Obama-era regulation, and any Republicans who supported him.

343
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,420
And we've got Biden, who failed to re-implement the regulation.

344
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,660
Though considering how much is on Biden's plate right now, and how his brain seems to

345
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,060
be literally leaking out of his ears sometimes, I'm not surprised he didn't remember that

346
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,060
this was an issue.

347
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,220
But surely other Democrats did, and they also failed to act.

348
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,860
Hopefully, now that this shit show is underway, they'll stop forgetting and actually do

349
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,420
something about this.

350
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,420
America is the most developed country in the world.

351
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,860
There's no need for you guys to be fucking things up this badly.

352
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,500
Yeah, I know that Libertarians are going to re until the cows come home about regulation,

353
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
but I don't want to hear it.

354
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,500
The corpos fucked up.

355
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
The Democrats fucked up.

356
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,580
And the Republicans fucked up.

357
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,260
And not just establishment ones, but Trump too.

358
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,920
If investigations turn out that ECP brakes would have prevented this disaster, then everyone

359
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,180
here is culpable.

360
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,260
I literally grew up right down the road from East Palestine.

361
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,920
My old childhood best friend lives in the fucking town.

362
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,960
My current best friend literally lives right next to the town.

363
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,880
It is so much worse than what the media is telling any of us.

364
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,560
I'm getting reports from people that are down there right now, that they're literally seeing

365
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:57,760
schools of fish floating down streams, rivers, fucking dead.

366
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,140
I got a video from my friend, okay, and she's like walking.

367
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:08,820
It's all fucking dead, all fucking dead, and on the top of the water is a really pretty

368
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
chemical rainbow sheen.

369
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,820
The chemicals are in the fucking water and they're lying to the rest of the country saying

370
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,820
they're not.

371
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:23,780
The water's been contaminated, the soil's been contaminated, the fucking air is contaminated.

372
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:30,120
You literally are about to see some of the worst fucking health side effects coming out

373
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,500
of people in that town.

374
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,420
It's not even funny, and y'all want to know something even more fucked up?

375
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:41,020
The restaurant that I work at, in a whole different state, had to donate food to them

376
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:48,180
because we had people from the churches calling to tell us that Red Cross never fucking came,

377
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:54,060
FEMA never fucking came, the environmental conservationists still have yet to fucking

378
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:59,620
come, and nobody's fucking helping them, meaning all of the fucking firefighters that were

379
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,160
working get no food, have nothing to help them, nothing, okay?

380
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,340
All the people that were displaced have no food, water, a place to stay, none of that

381
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,340
shit.

382
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,580
It is so much worse than what they're telling you, and TikTok probably won't even let me

383
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:18,320
post this video, but if this video gets posted, please save it and repost it everywhere you

384
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,940
fucking can, because I'm telling y'all, they are covering this shit up.

385
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,420
They are covering this shit up because they don't want to get in on how bad it actually

386
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,420
was.

387
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,420
This was not good.

388
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,940
This was the worst fucking thing that's happened probably in the past eight years.
