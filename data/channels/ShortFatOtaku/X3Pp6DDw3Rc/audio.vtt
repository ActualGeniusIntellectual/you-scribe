00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
Hello my friends, I was actually gone for a couple days, I don't know if you noticed,

00:03.360 --> 00:07.600
I was getting fiber optic internet installed, so hopefully this video is coming to you at the

00:07.600 --> 00:12.880
speed of light. If not, then maybe I've been had. Anyway, today we're talking about cancel culture,

00:12.880 --> 00:16.480
and more specifically, how I don't really care about it, and I hope you don't mind

00:16.480 --> 00:20.000
indulging me in an old man ramble for at least a couple of minutes.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.960
I've talked about my pre-political past on YouTube a few times now, I think I've done at least two

00:24.960 --> 00:29.680
videos on it. If you're new, this channel only really started getting into politics around

00:30.240 --> 00:35.680
Gamergate, and before that it was Game Playthroughs, which are now over on my Game Boomers channel,

00:35.680 --> 00:41.600
and before that they were anime reviews. That guy with the glasses styled anime reviews,

00:41.600 --> 00:46.640
all the way back in 2009. It was me and two friends, we were a lot younger and we were

00:46.640 --> 00:52.800
just having fun. That's why the channel's name is Short Fat Otaku, because we were all otakus.

00:52.800 --> 00:57.200
But that also means that I have a lot of old friends from other parts of the internet that

00:57.200 --> 01:02.160
aren't political, in fact parts that should be apolitical, like anime, like video games,

01:02.160 --> 01:07.280
let's plays, that kind of stuff. Places where frankly politics really shouldn't be injected,

01:07.280 --> 01:11.440
one way or the other. Now while I was offline getting that internet installed,

01:11.440 --> 01:16.720
I actually got removed from a discord of people that I used to be friends with a long time ago.

01:16.720 --> 01:21.200
And no, I am not asking you to cancel them, that's why I've censored all of their names,

01:21.200 --> 01:25.840
I just want to discuss the topic if you don't mind. I want you to read a little bit with me,

01:25.840 --> 01:30.560
just so we can discuss the nature of places that really should be apolitical,

01:30.560 --> 01:36.080
like non-politic side of YouTube, and how they've become politicized, and how the people

01:36.080 --> 01:42.160
in those spaces believe that that is morally justifiable, okay?

01:42.160 --> 01:45.440
It's been brought to our attention by several members of our community that due to your past

01:45.440 --> 01:49.200
actions and current content, people are uncomfortable with you continuing to be in

01:49.200 --> 01:54.560
the discord. We are aware that you think those people of different political views can coexist,

01:54.560 --> 01:58.080
but unfortunately when your views and actions cause harm and fear in others, that's not the

01:58.080 --> 02:02.880
case. As to what views and actions we're talking about, I'll show you in a bit.

02:02.880 --> 02:07.440
I understand that we have history. When we were just two gaming channels, despite being different,

02:07.440 --> 02:12.560
I appreciated our friendship. However, as much as I respect the ideal of looking past differing

02:12.560 --> 02:17.520
views, there's a line that I can't cross. The history of your words and ideals go against my

02:17.520 --> 02:22.480
own, my friends, and radiate a hatred that I can't tolerate in my community. Apparently,

02:22.480 --> 02:26.720
I radiate hatred, okay? I hope you understand. We're just too different,

02:26.720 --> 02:30.480
and even if you don't think we are, I hope you respect and understand that I do.

02:30.480 --> 02:35.440
And I mean, fair enough. Ultimately, this is their discord, not mine. It is not my place to complain.

02:35.440 --> 02:40.320
They have their rules, and even though I think they're completely ridiculous, it's their place.

02:40.320 --> 02:46.480
It's not mine. I would not do this in my discord. I personally do not tolerate any kind of xenophobia

02:46.480 --> 02:50.560
in the slightest. We are all about creating a safe and caring environment for everyone,

02:50.560 --> 02:54.560
for people to be themselves and feel like they belong. It's actually sad whenever a friendship

02:54.560 --> 02:59.280
ends due to what basically amounts to Trump Derangement Syndrome.

02:59.280 --> 03:04.320
But let me show you my offense, okay? We've been provided with screenshots of both old and recent

03:04.320 --> 03:08.720
SFO comments, content, and remarks, and so we've banned him. If you have interacted with his

03:08.720 --> 03:14.640
content because of this discord, or been offended by his actions, we're deeply sorry. I'm sorry you

03:14.640 --> 03:19.280
had to watch a YouTube video of me, dude. Provided below is one of the screenshots we received that

03:19.280 --> 03:24.160
pushed us to act. Please know that in this community we aim to make all people of all races,

03:24.160 --> 03:28.960
genders, and backgrounds feel welcome and safe. And you know what, frankly, so do I. But I would

03:28.960 --> 03:35.600
also add of political persuasions into that as well. Xenophobia, transphobia, um, I don't know

03:35.600 --> 03:42.240
if you'd accuse me of transphobia knowing my porn history, and any other form of intolerance will

03:42.240 --> 03:46.640
not be tolerated. Please reach out to a mod if you're feeling unsafe. We're here to keep this

03:46.640 --> 03:52.560
community one of acceptance and friendship. So here's the actual thing that got me the boot,

03:52.560 --> 03:57.520
and I think you can recognize what it is just by looking at it, eh? That's right, it's this tweet,

03:57.520 --> 04:04.240
dudes. The one where I found a bunch of people who were proudly undocumented, or proudly illegal

04:04.240 --> 04:10.240
immigrants, as stated in their own fucking bios on Twitter, and then tagged them into a thread with

04:10.240 --> 04:17.120
ice. And I even say in the thread, it's not about xenophobia. If you want to live in a

04:17.120 --> 04:23.200
nation, immigrate properly. I say it right here, and I still feel that way. If you want to live

04:23.200 --> 04:30.000
in a nation, immigrate properly. This is not a race issue. I'm not racist. This is certainly not

04:30.000 --> 04:36.720
a xenophobic issue. I am not afraid of or hateful towards people who come from different places or

04:36.720 --> 04:43.280
have different backgrounds. They are all welcome to immigrate properly to the West. They are all

04:43.280 --> 04:49.440
welcome to follow the rules, contribute to the society that they arrive in, and be a net positive

04:49.440 --> 04:54.560
to those around them. This isn't white nationalism or something nonsense like that. It's, in fact,

04:54.560 --> 05:00.080
the alt-right calls me a civ-nat wet noodle or something. Of course, you can also make the

05:00.080 --> 05:04.400
argument that, hey, despite that, maybe you shouldn't be tagging people in with ice. You

05:04.400 --> 05:09.920
know, it's like siccing the cops on them. It's like the guy who who narcs out. One,

05:09.920 --> 05:14.400
ICE doesn't actually watch their Twitter account, and I knew this when I made this. It was a fucking

05:14.400 --> 05:21.280
troll. And two, if you don't want to be deported, don't put proud illegal immigrant in the bio of

05:21.280 --> 05:26.640
your Twitter, you morons. But of course, that context doesn't really matter when it comes to

05:26.640 --> 05:32.640
smaller groups like this. Like get this, when he said he was centrist, that was a big red flag.

05:32.640 --> 05:37.520
To somebody who is on the radical left, the centrist might as well be the Nazi. They might

05:37.520 --> 05:43.280
as well be the radical right, because the centrist position is actually strong borders

05:43.920 --> 05:49.600
and legal immigration. That's the centrist position. The radical right position is strong

05:49.600 --> 05:54.720
borders, no immigration, and deportation of those they don't want there, even if they were there

05:54.720 --> 05:59.760
legally, like sending black people back to Africa or something. Meanwhile, the radical left position

05:59.760 --> 06:05.920
is no borders, no immigration system at all, pure unfettered movement of people. But to these

06:05.920 --> 06:11.360
people, the centrist position is too radical for them, which shows you how far left they've gone.

06:11.360 --> 06:14.880
And I can already hear their objections, and I understand them. The radical lefty will say that

06:14.880 --> 06:19.840
the centrist person is just like the right, because in practice, they just won't accept

06:19.840 --> 06:24.160
people of color or something. Fair enough, that might actually happen. However, the radical right

06:24.160 --> 06:30.240
person says that the centrist position might as well be the radical left position, because people

06:30.240 --> 06:35.120
will simply refuse to enforce border laws and don't care when illegals come through, which is

06:35.120 --> 06:40.080
kind of what happened under Bill Clinton. So their positions are equal but opposite. They believe the

06:40.080 --> 06:45.360
centrist to not be extreme enough for them, so therefore they must be extreme in the other way.

06:45.360 --> 06:50.640
Fundamentally, they have no idea what nuance is. I always view it as a mark of pride when somebody

06:50.640 --> 06:55.600
who thinks this way, in fact, also thinks my content is hateful and cruel. That's simply part

06:55.600 --> 07:00.000
of speaking the uncomfortable truths. However, it was never going to be about how I could argue my

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
case, or how I could show them how I'm not actually some kind of hateful bigot for holding these

07:06.000 --> 07:11.600
opinions. And in fact, these opinions not only have their basis in reality, but in some cases

07:11.600 --> 07:15.840
seem to be objectively true regarding certain things about governance. But it was never going

07:15.840 --> 07:20.240
to be about making a convincing argument, it was always going to be ideological. Nothing blatantly

07:20.240 --> 07:25.360
offensive was said in this discord. The ban was entirely decided on because of his actions outside

07:25.360 --> 07:31.040
of the discord. So it's just like Facebook banning you for stuff that you do off platform, or Patreon,

07:31.040 --> 07:34.960
or whoever else. It's the nonsense we've been fighting everywhere just on a much smaller scale,

07:34.960 --> 07:39.360
because this discord had like 50 people in it or something. Now I've actually got I think five

07:39.360 --> 07:43.680
people in there who are who are still like sending me messages and being like, lol have you seen what

07:43.680 --> 07:48.000
they've done now? And they did delete all of my messages, so I can't actually show you the rather

07:48.000 --> 07:53.520
tame political conversations that I had in their channel meant for heavier topics. But I can

07:53.520 --> 07:58.400
show you the reaction of their admins. I'm not having a fun discussion, this has been entirely

07:58.400 --> 08:04.720
unpleasant. This is in retaliation by the way to me saying that at the very least Trump isn't a

08:04.720 --> 08:10.240
fascist because fascists economically like to centralize and control everything happening in

08:10.240 --> 08:16.160
their state. All of the private economic activity is at least in some way regulated by them,

08:16.160 --> 08:20.640
while Trump has been going on a massive deregulatory spree. That is the actions

08:20.640 --> 08:25.120
of like an ANCAP almost, not a fascist. This person also believes that the discord is a safe

08:25.120 --> 08:30.000
space for those who Trump has has oppressed. I don't think he's actually personally grabbed

08:30.000 --> 08:34.320
you by the pussy. My refusal to agree to this statement is actually what got the ball rolling

08:34.320 --> 08:38.480
on this. Can we all agree that Trump is an absolute monster and by far the worst president possible?

08:38.480 --> 08:43.200
He has been openly sexist, he's racist, a pedophile, a rapist, his politics are terrible,

08:43.200 --> 08:47.760
he's an absolute idiot. But in terms of all of it, he is a monster and the worst. We can

08:47.760 --> 08:52.080
debate his garbage politics all day, but in the end hate crimes, assault, and white supremacy

08:52.080 --> 08:57.120
have grown louder and stronger. Human garbage has one of the biggest platforms on earth.

08:57.120 --> 09:01.280
You all know that I am neutral to Trump. He has done some things that I like,

09:01.280 --> 09:05.440
particularly economically. He has done other things that I don't like. For example,

09:05.440 --> 09:11.520
there was some LGBT stuff that Trump recently did that I actually openly oppose. I also oppose

09:11.520 --> 09:15.760
his stance on flag burning. You should be able to burn whatever flag you like. But my neutrality

09:15.760 --> 09:19.840
on him was apparently the big issue. Here's probably the funniest exchange of all. Again,

09:19.840 --> 09:23.440
you can't see my replies here because I've deleted all my messages. Unfortunately, you'll just have

09:23.440 --> 09:27.680
to take me at my word here. The admin, who at this point has always been the person in red,

09:27.680 --> 09:32.960
she says that I'm obviously a white person. And I say, well, no, I'm Métis. Which is like a half

09:32.960 --> 09:36.480
joke. I guess technically I am, but it doesn't really matter, right? For those of you who don't

09:36.480 --> 09:41.840
know, Métis is a Canadian term for people who have a mixture of white and native American

09:41.840 --> 09:47.280
heritage. And the reason that we use that term is because they were basically rejected from both the

09:47.280 --> 09:52.320
white and native communities back in the day. So they formed their own community and they are

09:52.320 --> 09:57.680
distinctly their own thing culturally. However, I am not Métis in any real sense. I don't look

09:57.680 --> 10:03.440
Métis. I don't practice any of the culture. I just happen to have a native ancestor back there

10:03.440 --> 10:07.440
somewhere. So it doesn't really matter. And in response to this, she says, if you look white,

10:07.440 --> 10:13.040
you reap the benefits. That's just a fact. My reply, which is where the white line would be,

10:13.040 --> 10:19.920
would be like, oh, that's actually like bisexual people. And that is in fact the truth. If you are

10:19.920 --> 10:25.280
not white, but you're white passing, you get white privilege. In the same vein, if you're bisexual

10:25.280 --> 10:30.480
and you're straight passing, then you have access to straight privilege. Like if you have an

10:30.480 --> 10:33.520
opposite gender partner and you're walking around outside and you're holding hands with them and

10:33.520 --> 10:38.000
you very clearly appear to be a heterosexual couple, even though you're bi, you have access

10:38.000 --> 10:42.560
to straight privilege. And that offended these people. What the fuck? Excuse me? I'd explain

10:42.560 --> 10:46.720
that ASAP. I didn't really get a chance to honestly explain it all that well because the conversation

10:46.720 --> 10:51.440
moved on. But I actually recall this from a feminist point of view. I think, what was her name?

10:51.440 --> 10:57.040
Dr. Jenny Roth? I got to look it up. Yeah, Dr. Jenny Roth. I don't know why her photo is upside

10:57.040 --> 11:02.800
down on Lakehead University's website, but I took a few of her feminist, a few of her gender

11:02.800 --> 11:06.880
studies classes when I was in university back there. And she is a bisexual woman. And she once

11:06.880 --> 11:12.160
said in her lectures that bisexual people have access to straight privilege and that ultimately

11:12.160 --> 11:16.800
it is a double-edged sword because in some ways your queerness is erased. And that could be

11:16.800 --> 11:21.280
in fact damaging to your identity, at least from the feminist point of view. But at the same time,

11:21.280 --> 11:26.640
you also get access to straight privilege. People who would look down upon flamboyantly gay people,

11:27.200 --> 11:31.600
or people in openly homosexual relationships, they will give you a pass. They won't think

11:31.600 --> 11:35.840
anything of you, even though you're actually bisexual. And she said she experienced as a

11:35.840 --> 11:40.480
bisexual woman both of those events, both gaining access to the privilege and also

11:40.480 --> 11:45.120
losing access to the identity. But these people don't care about that nuance.

11:45.120 --> 11:48.640
Even though the exact same logic is used to say that you have white privilege,

11:48.640 --> 11:52.240
even if you're not actually white, when you apply that same logic to bisexuality,

11:52.240 --> 11:56.720
it's apparently completely offensive. Even though it is not only the same logic,

11:57.360 --> 12:01.200
but confirmed by the real-life feminists that I know.

12:01.200 --> 12:04.480
So far I've kind of been indulging myself here, and I think that's why I made this a

12:04.480 --> 12:09.520
DevTrospective video instead of a main SFO video. Because I'm talking more off the cuff.

12:09.520 --> 12:14.800
And I'm talking about stuff that's closer to me. This is a personal encounter. And by the way,

12:14.800 --> 12:19.680
that is the reason why I censored everyone's names. I do not want you to go after these people.

12:19.680 --> 12:24.240
I certainly do not want cancer culture to descend upon them. Although, as an aside,

12:24.240 --> 12:28.800
would it surprise you to know that the person speaking in red, that this is who they are?

12:29.760 --> 12:34.720
Yeah, I had a feeling like five years ago, the minute that that relationship started,

12:34.720 --> 12:38.560
the friendship was over, unfortunately. It just took us this long to get there.

12:39.360 --> 12:42.960
Okay, that was a little blow, I know, but that one was just for me personally.

12:42.960 --> 12:47.120
And besides, we all know somebody like this, don't we? With the dyed hair and the glasses attempting

12:47.120 --> 12:51.600
to appear unique, who talks about how progressive and moral they are, who talks about having the

12:51.600 --> 12:57.280
right politics, but ultimately is just a cover for them being fundamentally a nasty person.

12:57.280 --> 13:03.520
And believe it or not, this is not a video about me ranting about old friends. It's not. Because

13:03.520 --> 13:09.760
I realized something while this was happening to me, that if these people had any actual power,

13:09.760 --> 13:16.320
they would have wielded it against me. Because in this tiny space, where it's a discord of only a

13:16.320 --> 13:21.200
few dozen people, they still couldn't resist doing what every single person does whenever

13:21.200 --> 13:26.080
they engage in some kind of cancel culture nonsense. And I'm guilty of this too. I jumped

13:26.080 --> 13:31.280
on the ProJared bandwagon last year, and I was wrong. I should not have done that. And that's

13:31.280 --> 13:37.360
the main reason I'm refusing to jump on the Angry Joe bandwagon and the Twitch blackout people,

13:37.360 --> 13:42.080
and all this stuff, all these accusations coming out right now. I will not. I will not make the

13:42.080 --> 13:47.280
same mistake again. It was a moral failing on my part that I did that. And frankly,

13:47.280 --> 13:52.320
but for the grace of God, go I. If these people who had thrown me out of their discord actually

13:52.320 --> 13:57.440
had, say, millions of followers instead of a couple thousand or something, if they actually

13:57.440 --> 14:02.320
had the ability to do so, if they actually had a presence, I do believe that there would have been

14:02.320 --> 14:08.960
an attempt, partially organic and grassroots and partially not, to have me canceled over those old

14:08.960 --> 14:15.840
ICE tweets. And then I had to ask myself, like, why do I care about being canceled so much? And

14:16.400 --> 14:21.520
after thinking it through, I realized that I just don't anymore. It's as simple as that. I'm tired

14:21.520 --> 14:27.120
of it. I'm tired of cancel culture. I'm tired of knee jerk reacting to everything. It's emotionally

14:27.120 --> 14:32.720
draining. I'm tired of baselessly accusing people or adding to other people's accusations when

14:32.720 --> 14:38.320
there's no solid proof behind them. It makes me feel immoral. I'm tired of being pressured to care

14:38.320 --> 14:43.520
about stuff. Maybe it sounds selfish of me, but like, I have two people in my life who are very

14:43.520 --> 14:48.960
close to me, who on some level, I am at least partially caring for. I'm working as hard as I

14:48.960 --> 14:53.360
can, oftentimes more than 12 hours a day, every day at the YouTube thing, the streaming thing.

14:53.360 --> 14:57.120
I know for some of you, it's your dream job. It's my dream job, too. I wouldn't trade it for the

14:57.120 --> 15:01.600
world, but that's not to say that it's not work. Maybe I'm just a weakling, but it is somewhat

15:01.600 --> 15:07.440
draining just to get through life sometimes. And I'm tired of being pressured to care about stuff

15:07.440 --> 15:12.640
that on some level I just don't care about. And now I'm going to be canceled and called a bad

15:12.640 --> 15:17.600
person, a racist, a Nazi, an alt writer, whatever, because I'm not caring in the right way. Because

15:17.600 --> 15:23.200
I'm not posting hashtag black lives matter in my tweets. I'm not flying an LGBTQ flag. I'm not

15:23.200 --> 15:28.880
changing my avatar to a black square or a COVID awareness banner or whatever the most recent social

15:28.880 --> 15:35.120
media nonsense is. I'm tired of being forced to give a shit. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of being

15:35.120 --> 15:42.160
told that my sense of humor is now no longer valid when those same people engaged in it 5 or

15:42.160 --> 15:48.640
10 years ago. I'm tired of being told that my view on Islam is hateful and bigoted and xenophobic.

15:48.640 --> 15:53.040
When the exact same people said the exact same thing about Christianity back during the Bush

15:53.040 --> 15:57.440
and Obama years. I guess it's okay to discriminate against gay people if your skin is brown or

15:57.440 --> 16:03.840
something. I still think edgy 4chan Newgrounds style humor is funny. And I'm tired of pretending

16:03.840 --> 16:10.080
that I don't. I'm tired of being told that the mainstream center left positions that I

16:10.080 --> 16:16.240
hold politically now make me a white nationalist and a Nazi. And the on the ground effect of all

16:16.240 --> 16:21.360
of this stuff is cancel culture. For example, when the riots heated up in the United States,

16:21.360 --> 16:27.520
Jon Tron posted this variant of the I just want to grill meme. The accompanying tweet said these

16:27.520 --> 16:32.400
last few days along with everyone else have made me feel incredibly sad. Through these uncertain

16:32.400 --> 16:37.120
times, I hope to bring laughter to your lives through my continued videos. Please stay safe

16:37.120 --> 16:41.760
out there peace, a completely reasonable reaction, and the internet tried to cancel him over it

16:41.760 --> 16:46.480
because he was not explicitly endorsing one point of view over another. Even though that's not his

16:46.480 --> 16:50.080
job. He's an entertainer. He's not a political pundit. And here's his response to getting

16:50.080 --> 16:53.680
canceled. What we're doing the COVID sequel already. Man, they're really just starting

16:53.680 --> 16:57.440
to recycle ideas at this point. I'm just gonna go watch reruns of Occupy Wall Street.

16:58.400 --> 17:04.560
And I get it. It's funny, but this is what he says to people trying to cancel him over being

17:04.560 --> 17:10.400
politically neutral over staying in the center over not publicly grandstanding over not virtue

17:10.400 --> 17:14.320
signaling. We all think virtue signaling is cringy as fuck. But when you don't do it,

17:14.320 --> 17:21.040
they cancel you. This is a much politer version of that. That one Twitter video of the Joker getting

17:21.040 --> 17:26.000
ready to say the N word and how much of a ridiculous build up it was to that same energy.

17:26.000 --> 17:32.080
And it's the same energy because it is a complete and total disregard for the social norm. The new

17:32.080 --> 17:37.280
social norm now is social justice oriented stuff. But it's a complete and total disregard for it.

17:37.280 --> 17:42.640
In fact, back before the social justice warriors held political power, they got a kick out of

17:42.640 --> 17:47.680
breaking the old social norm that was religious Christianity, you know, the the resurgent

17:47.680 --> 17:52.800
religious Christian right that kind of ran things back in the 90s. The proto leftist back then

17:52.800 --> 17:57.440
really reveled in being edgy and you know, tipping their four doors and stuff. This is the exact same

17:57.440 --> 18:01.280
kind of thing. And it's why they hate john Trump. But this stuff is everywhere, man. And I'm just

18:01.280 --> 18:06.240
tired of it. Nebraska Democrats renounced their Senate pick over his previous comments. Audio

18:06.240 --> 18:12.640
emerges of Jimmy Kimmel allegedly using the N word back from 1996. Lana del Rey doja cat and

18:12.640 --> 18:17.760
Jimmy Fallon have all been canceled in the past month. The account brother nature has a history

18:17.760 --> 18:23.040
of racist tweets. It turns out those tweets happened when the person running the account

18:23.040 --> 18:30.400
was 12 years old. Connor daily a NASCAR driver lost a sponsorship because of a racially insensitive

18:30.400 --> 18:37.280
remark made not by him but by his father in the 1980s. And the left participates in it with glee.

18:37.280 --> 18:41.360
Sometimes they even call for it to happen themselves. I'm sure this attempt here by

18:41.360 --> 18:45.680
Christie winters didn't really go anywhere because Christie winters is a nobody, but they know exactly

18:45.680 --> 18:50.320
what kind of power they wield. And it's not just grassroots. We also know that this sort of thing

18:50.320 --> 18:56.400
is organized and corporate TV networks have enlisted p eyes to scour stars social media

18:56.400 --> 19:01.600
for racism. They get clicks and therefore revenue when someone gets canceled. So of course they want

19:01.600 --> 19:06.720
to push that shit. The left also knows to pick its targets. Well, here's Owen Jones, the UK's

19:06.720 --> 19:10.960
resident bumbling idiot on the whole Yorkshire tea thing that was happening a little while ago.

19:10.960 --> 19:16.080
Um, you're clearly all having fun, but this hashtag Sue you're shouting at tea thing is

19:16.080 --> 19:20.320
really disturbing. I realize this will all make Yorkshire tea a lot of money, but picking on a

19:20.320 --> 19:24.880
random member of the public being silly on Twitter, who we know nothing about and who sounds vulnerable.

19:24.880 --> 19:29.840
Um, Oh, so you're against cancel culture then Owen? It sounds like it sounds like this random person

19:29.840 --> 19:35.280
just made a weird tweet and now everyone is descending on them. Sounds bad. Yorkshire tea

19:35.280 --> 19:40.480
have told a far right vlogger not to buy their tea again and enraged right wing extremists are

19:40.480 --> 19:45.840
throwing theirs in the bin. You absolutely love to see it. Oh, so cancel culture is only valid

19:45.840 --> 19:50.720
if you go after the right targets then Owen, is that it? I don't even know which far right vlogger

19:50.720 --> 19:56.240
you're talking about, but I do not trust your opinion on what the far right actually is. But

19:56.240 --> 20:01.760
more to the point of this video, cancel culture is valid if the target of cancel culture has the

20:01.760 --> 20:08.000
wrong politics. From Dave Chappelle and Joe Rogan to Andy Ngo and Laura Loomer to Sargon and the

20:08.000 --> 20:14.480
Ralph retort, cancel culture is wrong every single time it happens. Cancel culture is the tool of the

20:14.480 --> 20:19.360
person who wants to hurt someone else, but they have no actual reason to do so. They have no

20:19.360 --> 20:23.520
grievance, they haven't actually been harmed in any way. They can't bring something before a court,

20:23.520 --> 20:28.080
they have no receipts to show, but they hate you. Maybe they're jealous of you. Maybe they think

20:28.080 --> 20:32.240
you're a disgusting member of society and therefore you have to be purged, regardless of

20:32.240 --> 20:36.240
the truth on that. Maybe it makes themself feel better to think they've done some good in the

20:36.240 --> 20:40.000
world and frankly they don't feel good all that often so they're just going to take what they can

20:40.000 --> 20:45.280
get. Maybe it just gives them that cathartic release that they've been searching for, just to

20:45.280 --> 20:50.960
hate on somebody. Whatever it is, it's illegitimate. And worst of all, this is something that the left

20:50.960 --> 20:55.680
actually fought against back when I was younger. It was the religious right that would employ a

20:55.680 --> 20:59.760
variant of cancel culture. Did you know that you have a gay person working for you? Maybe you

20:59.760 --> 21:03.760
should fire them. Maybe the children shouldn't be around them. Do you think it's appropriate after

21:03.760 --> 21:08.640
9-11 to have a Muslim working in your shop? But nowadays cancel culture comes from the left,

21:08.640 --> 21:12.880
as do those people that are now defending it. Critics of cancel culture really just hate

21:12.880 --> 21:18.080
democracy. You are technically correct if we're talking about the mob rule style of democracy,

21:18.080 --> 21:24.720
but there is no real justice in that. While our society rightly values protest and free expression,

21:24.720 --> 21:29.600
the critics of cancel culture turn this virtue into a vice, contemptuously dismissing those

21:29.600 --> 21:34.400
who collectively express their disapproval. This is not what's happening right now. People

21:34.400 --> 21:40.160
are free to cancel whoever they like. That is the power of the consumer boycott. In essence,

21:40.160 --> 21:46.400
Gamergate itself, back in the day, was cancel culture. And we can see just how badly the

21:46.400 --> 21:50.800
progressives reacted to being cancelled back then. But the consumer boycott is one of the

21:50.800 --> 21:55.920
only things that regular people can do to effect change in the marketplace. But I'm not talking

21:55.920 --> 22:01.120
about that. I'm talking about what happens to people who have a neutral opinion, or who refuse

22:01.120 --> 22:06.080
to act. The people who choose not to virtue signal. They get cancelled as well. I know I

22:06.080 --> 22:10.960
keep resorting to the old well of horseshoe theory in this video, but it is very much like George

22:10.960 --> 22:16.080
Bush saying you're either with us or against us. I remember very vividly the left decrying that when

22:16.080 --> 22:20.560
it happened. But now that Bush is out of mind, they're doing the exact same thing. One of the

22:20.560 --> 22:26.960
artists who works on my channel drew a gender-bent variant of PewDiePie. Yikes! It looks like I'm

22:26.960 --> 22:31.440
taking a break from your shopping page. Of course you are. Sad, because I like their stuff, but

22:31.440 --> 22:35.360
right along with you, how come you're ignoring everyone who has a good reason to be angry? No

22:35.360 --> 22:39.520
one has a good reason to be angry. You're all stupid if you do. But liking everyone who supports

22:39.520 --> 22:45.040
this awful person. There was no reply, so I believe I asked why you're ignoring people.

22:45.040 --> 22:51.760
There is no legitimate reason to hate PewDiePie. He's not a Nazi. He's not an alt-rider. He's not

22:51.760 --> 22:58.320
a white supremacist. Your real problem with Pewds is that he's edgier. He still behaves in some ways

22:58.320 --> 23:04.080
like it's 2012 internet, just like I do. And because he won't take you and your politics 100%

23:04.080 --> 23:10.480
seriously, he's evil. I kept frantically hoping she would like, catch every blatant hint people

23:10.480 --> 23:15.360
were throwing that this shit is bad, but she's actively ignoring. I don't want to speak for her.

23:16.160 --> 23:22.320
I would assume she just disagrees with you and thinks you are stupid. I'm really sad you are

23:22.320 --> 23:27.600
supporting a racist anti-semitic alt-right edgelord. That's not kawaii at all. Please do

23:27.600 --> 23:32.080
some research into this guy's history and even current news. Why do you support a neo-nazi who

23:32.080 --> 23:36.960
not only backs the alt-right, but is anti-semitic, uses racial slurs against black people, and

23:36.960 --> 23:42.640
inspired a large massacre against innocent brown Muslims? I thought this was a joke comment, but

23:42.640 --> 23:47.280
it's actually real. Yes, he's a goddamn neo-nazi. This is the kind of content he's promoted. He

23:47.280 --> 23:50.720
followed prominent members of the alt-right on Twitter and then unfollowed them to hide the

23:50.720 --> 23:55.360
fact right after the massacre. You can't go around saying racist derogatory comments and jokes

23:55.360 --> 23:59.440
against racial and religious groups and expect anything bad to come of it. This artist of mine

23:59.440 --> 24:04.560
sent me a few more funny things. My mutuals, if you're following Shadbase or Sledbox, I'm

24:04.560 --> 24:09.840
unfollowing. I adore y'all, but you have no reason to be following these toxic artists.

24:09.840 --> 24:14.880
Of course it had to be fucking Shadbase, dude. This is a study from Cambridge titled Does

24:14.880 --> 24:21.760
Apologizing Work? An Empirical Test of Conventional Wisdom. Let's read the abstract. Public figures

24:21.760 --> 24:26.080
often apologize after making controversial statements. There are reasons to believe,

24:26.080 --> 24:31.920
however, that apologizing makes public figures appear weak and risk-averse, which may make them

24:31.920 --> 24:36.080
less likable and lead members of the public to actually want to punish them.

24:36.080 --> 24:39.920
When presented with two versions of the controversy surrounding Larry Summers,

24:39.920 --> 24:44.000
liberals and females were more likely to say that he should have faced negative consequences

24:44.000 --> 24:49.120
for his statement when presented with his apology. The effects on other groups were smaller or

24:49.120 --> 24:53.520
neutral. This suggests that when a prominent figure apologizes for a controversial statement,

24:53.520 --> 24:58.560
individuals are either unaffected or become more likely to desire that the individual be punished.

24:58.640 --> 25:04.400
It's a crazy study. It basically implies that apologizing for your edgy past doesn't

25:04.400 --> 25:09.360
actually do anything. And in fact, to the exact demographic of people who are demanding your

25:09.360 --> 25:14.720
apology, it lowers their opinion of you. I would like you to combine your knowledge of that study

25:14.720 --> 25:21.600
now with this exchange on Twitter. This verified lefty decides to draw a comic about cancel culture

25:21.600 --> 25:26.800
and very clearly he is disdainful of the idea that cancel culture is bad because he draws a comic

25:26.800 --> 25:32.080
about a guy who he gets canceled and then he ends up kind of spinning his canceling into a career

25:32.080 --> 25:36.560
and makes a whole bunch of money. The reply to that is, shouldn't this make you want to not

25:36.560 --> 25:41.040
cancel people given that it's effectively amplifying their voices through channels that

25:41.040 --> 25:47.600
take joy from their cancellation? And he simply replies, no. Cancel culture is not about doing

25:47.600 --> 25:53.520
good. It is not about righting wrongs. It is not about making the world a better place. It's not

25:53.520 --> 26:01.280
about education. It is about that cathartic release that a lefty feels when they've identified

26:01.280 --> 26:06.080
somebody that they view to be impure and when they have, with their righteous indignation,

26:06.080 --> 26:10.800
purged them for the good of their community. I can only assume that the Christians of old who

26:10.800 --> 26:16.080
killed witches felt the exact same way when they did it. They had the perfect outlet for their

26:16.080 --> 26:21.600
impotent hate and rage. They had a way to oppress other people within a framework that makes them

26:21.600 --> 26:26.800
the victim. And they had the perfect moral cover to indulge in harming those around them.

26:27.440 --> 26:30.960
See, I told you at the beginning, this wasn't just going to be a video about a personal event

26:30.960 --> 26:34.400
that happened to me. It's really not about that. That was just my springboard into the larger

26:34.400 --> 26:40.480
topic. My point with that was to show if those people had a large community and not a small one,

26:40.480 --> 26:45.520
which is what they have, you might see an attempt to cancel me right now. And you know what? Here,

26:45.520 --> 26:48.800
I'll just, I'll just make it easy for you. Take this and clip it. Maybe I'll even clip it on my

26:48.800 --> 26:54.320
own channel just for convenience sake. If cancel culture ever comes for me, here in one little

26:54.320 --> 27:01.440
package are all the hateful, terrible, racist, bigoted, misogynist, transphobic, xenophobic

27:01.440 --> 27:07.600
things that I believe all in one go. Okay, here they are. I believe that gay people, trans people,

27:07.600 --> 27:14.080
people of any race, of any ethnicity, of any religion deserve the same equal rights as anyone

27:14.080 --> 27:19.360
else. That also means they have the same responsibility to uphold others' rights as

27:19.360 --> 27:25.200
everyone else. Meaning that if you are a fanatic Muslim, no, you cannot simply kill gay people

27:25.200 --> 27:29.520
because they have a right to life. I believe that trans people should be allowed to do whatever they

27:29.520 --> 27:33.760
want. If they want to transition as adults, that's their business. They are legal adults.

27:33.760 --> 27:38.400
They can do what they like. However, I believe that children should not be allowed to medically

27:38.400 --> 27:43.360
transition with hormones until they turn 18, or at least the age of majority in your country.

27:43.360 --> 27:47.680
We don't let kids make serious decisions until they're adults. I think the same standard should

27:47.680 --> 27:52.880
apply with transitioning, and that does not make me transphobic. I believe that a liberal, free

27:52.880 --> 27:58.080
society requires a strong border. I believe that illegal immigrants flooding into a country

27:58.080 --> 28:02.960
depresses the value of labor in the market. Because why should a company pay you minimum wage

28:02.960 --> 28:07.840
when they can hire an illegal for half that price? Therefore, I believe one of the best ways to help

28:07.920 --> 28:13.920
the working class is to end illegal immigration, and enforce border laws. However, I don't want

28:13.920 --> 28:20.480
those border laws enforced on a racial or ethnic basis. I am happy for any race, or any ethnicity,

28:20.480 --> 28:26.160
or even any religion of person to come to the West and live in a Western country, as long as they do

28:26.160 --> 28:32.880
so legally, and they do so with the intention of upholding our values. And probably most importantly

28:32.880 --> 28:38.240
of all, I don't believe that hate speech should be censored. I believe that hate speech is properly

28:38.240 --> 28:44.080
countered with more speech, with better speech, with competent debate. I believe that if you

28:44.080 --> 28:49.040
censor hate speech, it's because you have no actual argument against it. And that means that

28:49.040 --> 28:54.080
either you're shit at debating, which is possible, or that your ideas are even worse than the hate

28:54.080 --> 28:59.440
speech that you're listening to. The leftists of my era understood that sunlight was the best

28:59.440 --> 29:04.480
disinfectant, meaning that when you engage people with radical ideas rather than isolate them and

29:04.480 --> 29:10.480
ban them from places, you end up de-radicalizing them, as long as your own ideas are actually sound.

29:10.480 --> 29:15.680
In banning people from discords, in banning them from social media platforms, in canceling them

29:15.680 --> 29:20.800
whenever something even minor happens, you are only serving to radicalize more people, not

29:20.800 --> 29:27.600
de-radicalize them. Now, if everything that I've just said to the progressives in five or ten years

29:28.160 --> 29:33.520
make me equal to Hitler himself, because things have just gone that crazy in the future,

29:33.520 --> 29:40.640
then go ahead, cancel me. I don't fucking care anymore. But never, for the rest of my natural

29:40.640 --> 29:47.040
life, will I walk back any of the things that I just said. The natural impulse is to do so,

29:47.040 --> 29:50.800
you know, when you have a thousand people telling you that you fucked up, that you're the wrong one,

29:50.800 --> 29:54.400
you know, the natural impulse is to say, oh man, with that many people, maybe I did,

29:54.400 --> 29:57.760
maybe I did make a big mistake, like am I wrong here? I don't want to be wrong,

29:57.760 --> 30:02.640
I don't want to be acting immoral, did I actually hurt somebody? Nobody wants to be the person that

30:02.640 --> 30:07.520
hurt an innocent. I understand that, but we're past that point now. We are at the point where

30:08.640 --> 30:13.680
if you don't have the right politics, if you are neutral to what they consider to be evil,

30:14.400 --> 30:21.040
if you even simply stay silent and don't virtue signal, they consider you to be as evil as the

30:21.040 --> 30:26.640
original evil that they claim to fight. That is unacceptable, and I will not be a part of it.
