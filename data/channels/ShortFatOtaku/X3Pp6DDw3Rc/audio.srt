00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Hello my friends, I was actually gone for a couple days, I don't know if you noticed,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,600
I was getting fiber optic internet installed, so hopefully this video is coming to you at the

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,880
speed of light. If not, then maybe I've been had. Anyway, today we're talking about cancel culture,

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,480
and more specifically, how I don't really care about it, and I hope you don't mind

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,000
indulging me in an old man ramble for at least a couple of minutes.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,960
I've talked about my pre-political past on YouTube a few times now, I think I've done at least two

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,680
videos on it. If you're new, this channel only really started getting into politics around

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,680
Gamergate, and before that it was Game Playthroughs, which are now over on my Game Boomers channel,

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,600
and before that they were anime reviews. That guy with the glasses styled anime reviews,

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,640
all the way back in 2009. It was me and two friends, we were a lot younger and we were

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,800
just having fun. That's why the channel's name is Short Fat Otaku, because we were all otakus.

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,200
But that also means that I have a lot of old friends from other parts of the internet that

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,160
aren't political, in fact parts that should be apolitical, like anime, like video games,

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,280
let's plays, that kind of stuff. Places where frankly politics really shouldn't be injected,

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,440
one way or the other. Now while I was offline getting that internet installed,

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,720
I actually got removed from a discord of people that I used to be friends with a long time ago.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,200
And no, I am not asking you to cancel them, that's why I've censored all of their names,

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,840
I just want to discuss the topic if you don't mind. I want you to read a little bit with me,

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,560
just so we can discuss the nature of places that really should be apolitical,

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,080
like non-politic side of YouTube, and how they've become politicized, and how the people

21
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,160
in those spaces believe that that is morally justifiable, okay?

22
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,440
It's been brought to our attention by several members of our community that due to your past

23
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,200
actions and current content, people are uncomfortable with you continuing to be in

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,560
the discord. We are aware that you think those people of different political views can coexist,

25
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,080
but unfortunately when your views and actions cause harm and fear in others, that's not the

26
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,880
case. As to what views and actions we're talking about, I'll show you in a bit.

27
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,440
I understand that we have history. When we were just two gaming channels, despite being different,

28
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,560
I appreciated our friendship. However, as much as I respect the ideal of looking past differing

29
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,520
views, there's a line that I can't cross. The history of your words and ideals go against my

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,480
own, my friends, and radiate a hatred that I can't tolerate in my community. Apparently,

31
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,720
I radiate hatred, okay? I hope you understand. We're just too different,

32
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,480
and even if you don't think we are, I hope you respect and understand that I do.

33
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,440
And I mean, fair enough. Ultimately, this is their discord, not mine. It is not my place to complain.

34
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,320
They have their rules, and even though I think they're completely ridiculous, it's their place.

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,480
It's not mine. I would not do this in my discord. I personally do not tolerate any kind of xenophobia

36
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,560
in the slightest. We are all about creating a safe and caring environment for everyone,

37
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,560
for people to be themselves and feel like they belong. It's actually sad whenever a friendship

38
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,280
ends due to what basically amounts to Trump Derangement Syndrome.

39
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,320
But let me show you my offense, okay? We've been provided with screenshots of both old and recent

40
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,720
SFO comments, content, and remarks, and so we've banned him. If you have interacted with his

41
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,640
content because of this discord, or been offended by his actions, we're deeply sorry. I'm sorry you

42
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,280
had to watch a YouTube video of me, dude. Provided below is one of the screenshots we received that

43
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,160
pushed us to act. Please know that in this community we aim to make all people of all races,

44
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,960
genders, and backgrounds feel welcome and safe. And you know what, frankly, so do I. But I would

45
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:35,600
also add of political persuasions into that as well. Xenophobia, transphobia, um, I don't know

46
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,240
if you'd accuse me of transphobia knowing my porn history, and any other form of intolerance will

47
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,640
not be tolerated. Please reach out to a mod if you're feeling unsafe. We're here to keep this

48
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,560
community one of acceptance and friendship. So here's the actual thing that got me the boot,

49
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,520
and I think you can recognize what it is just by looking at it, eh? That's right, it's this tweet,

50
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:04,240
dudes. The one where I found a bunch of people who were proudly undocumented, or proudly illegal

51
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:10,240
immigrants, as stated in their own fucking bios on Twitter, and then tagged them into a thread with

52
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:17,120
ice. And I even say in the thread, it's not about xenophobia. If you want to live in a

53
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,200
nation, immigrate properly. I say it right here, and I still feel that way. If you want to live

54
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:30,000
in a nation, immigrate properly. This is not a race issue. I'm not racist. This is certainly not

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,720
a xenophobic issue. I am not afraid of or hateful towards people who come from different places or

56
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,280
have different backgrounds. They are all welcome to immigrate properly to the West. They are all

57
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,440
welcome to follow the rules, contribute to the society that they arrive in, and be a net positive

58
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,560
to those around them. This isn't white nationalism or something nonsense like that. It's, in fact,

59
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,080
the alt-right calls me a civ-nat wet noodle or something. Of course, you can also make the

60
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,400
argument that, hey, despite that, maybe you shouldn't be tagging people in with ice. You

61
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,920
know, it's like siccing the cops on them. It's like the guy who who narcs out. One,

62
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,400
ICE doesn't actually watch their Twitter account, and I knew this when I made this. It was a fucking

63
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,280
troll. And two, if you don't want to be deported, don't put proud illegal immigrant in the bio of

64
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,640
your Twitter, you morons. But of course, that context doesn't really matter when it comes to

65
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,640
smaller groups like this. Like get this, when he said he was centrist, that was a big red flag.

66
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,520
To somebody who is on the radical left, the centrist might as well be the Nazi. They might

67
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,280
as well be the radical right, because the centrist position is actually strong borders

68
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,600
and legal immigration. That's the centrist position. The radical right position is strong

69
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,720
borders, no immigration, and deportation of those they don't want there, even if they were there

70
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,760
legally, like sending black people back to Africa or something. Meanwhile, the radical left position

71
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,920
is no borders, no immigration system at all, pure unfettered movement of people. But to these

72
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:11,360
people, the centrist position is too radical for them, which shows you how far left they've gone.

73
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,880
And I can already hear their objections, and I understand them. The radical lefty will say that

74
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,840
the centrist person is just like the right, because in practice, they just won't accept

75
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,160
people of color or something. Fair enough, that might actually happen. However, the radical right

76
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,240
person says that the centrist position might as well be the radical left position, because people

77
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,120
will simply refuse to enforce border laws and don't care when illegals come through, which is

78
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,080
kind of what happened under Bill Clinton. So their positions are equal but opposite. They believe the

79
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,360
centrist to not be extreme enough for them, so therefore they must be extreme in the other way.

80
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,640
Fundamentally, they have no idea what nuance is. I always view it as a mark of pride when somebody

81
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,600
who thinks this way, in fact, also thinks my content is hateful and cruel. That's simply part

82
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,000
of speaking the uncomfortable truths. However, it was never going to be about how I could argue my

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
case, or how I could show them how I'm not actually some kind of hateful bigot for holding these

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,600
opinions. And in fact, these opinions not only have their basis in reality, but in some cases

85
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,840
seem to be objectively true regarding certain things about governance. But it was never going

86
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,240
to be about making a convincing argument, it was always going to be ideological. Nothing blatantly

87
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,360
offensive was said in this discord. The ban was entirely decided on because of his actions outside

88
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,040
of the discord. So it's just like Facebook banning you for stuff that you do off platform, or Patreon,

89
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,960
or whoever else. It's the nonsense we've been fighting everywhere just on a much smaller scale,

90
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,360
because this discord had like 50 people in it or something. Now I've actually got I think five

91
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,680
people in there who are who are still like sending me messages and being like, lol have you seen what

92
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,000
they've done now? And they did delete all of my messages, so I can't actually show you the rather

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,520
tame political conversations that I had in their channel meant for heavier topics. But I can

94
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,400
show you the reaction of their admins. I'm not having a fun discussion, this has been entirely

95
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,720
unpleasant. This is in retaliation by the way to me saying that at the very least Trump isn't a

96
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,240
fascist because fascists economically like to centralize and control everything happening in

97
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,160
their state. All of the private economic activity is at least in some way regulated by them,

98
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,640
while Trump has been going on a massive deregulatory spree. That is the actions

99
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,120
of like an ANCAP almost, not a fascist. This person also believes that the discord is a safe

100
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,000
space for those who Trump has has oppressed. I don't think he's actually personally grabbed

101
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,320
you by the pussy. My refusal to agree to this statement is actually what got the ball rolling

102
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,480
on this. Can we all agree that Trump is an absolute monster and by far the worst president possible?

103
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,200
He has been openly sexist, he's racist, a pedophile, a rapist, his politics are terrible,

104
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,760
he's an absolute idiot. But in terms of all of it, he is a monster and the worst. We can

105
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,080
debate his garbage politics all day, but in the end hate crimes, assault, and white supremacy

106
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,120
have grown louder and stronger. Human garbage has one of the biggest platforms on earth.

107
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,280
You all know that I am neutral to Trump. He has done some things that I like,

108
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,440
particularly economically. He has done other things that I don't like. For example,

109
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,520
there was some LGBT stuff that Trump recently did that I actually openly oppose. I also oppose

110
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,760
his stance on flag burning. You should be able to burn whatever flag you like. But my neutrality

111
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,840
on him was apparently the big issue. Here's probably the funniest exchange of all. Again,

112
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,440
you can't see my replies here because I've deleted all my messages. Unfortunately, you'll just have

113
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,680
to take me at my word here. The admin, who at this point has always been the person in red,

114
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,960
she says that I'm obviously a white person. And I say, well, no, I'm Métis. Which is like a half

115
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,480
joke. I guess technically I am, but it doesn't really matter, right? For those of you who don't

116
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,840
know, Métis is a Canadian term for people who have a mixture of white and native American

117
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,280
heritage. And the reason that we use that term is because they were basically rejected from both the

118
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,320
white and native communities back in the day. So they formed their own community and they are

119
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,680
distinctly their own thing culturally. However, I am not Métis in any real sense. I don't look

120
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,440
Métis. I don't practice any of the culture. I just happen to have a native ancestor back there

121
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,440
somewhere. So it doesn't really matter. And in response to this, she says, if you look white,

122
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,040
you reap the benefits. That's just a fact. My reply, which is where the white line would be,

123
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,920
would be like, oh, that's actually like bisexual people. And that is in fact the truth. If you are

124
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,280
not white, but you're white passing, you get white privilege. In the same vein, if you're bisexual

125
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,480
and you're straight passing, then you have access to straight privilege. Like if you have an

126
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,520
opposite gender partner and you're walking around outside and you're holding hands with them and

127
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,000
you very clearly appear to be a heterosexual couple, even though you're bi, you have access

128
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,560
to straight privilege. And that offended these people. What the fuck? Excuse me? I'd explain

129
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,720
that ASAP. I didn't really get a chance to honestly explain it all that well because the conversation

130
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,440
moved on. But I actually recall this from a feminist point of view. I think, what was her name?

131
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,040
Dr. Jenny Roth? I got to look it up. Yeah, Dr. Jenny Roth. I don't know why her photo is upside

132
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,800
down on Lakehead University's website, but I took a few of her feminist, a few of her gender

133
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,880
studies classes when I was in university back there. And she is a bisexual woman. And she once

134
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,160
said in her lectures that bisexual people have access to straight privilege and that ultimately

135
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,800
it is a double-edged sword because in some ways your queerness is erased. And that could be

136
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,280
in fact damaging to your identity, at least from the feminist point of view. But at the same time,

137
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,640
you also get access to straight privilege. People who would look down upon flamboyantly gay people,

138
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,600
or people in openly homosexual relationships, they will give you a pass. They won't think

139
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,840
anything of you, even though you're actually bisexual. And she said she experienced as a

140
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,480
bisexual woman both of those events, both gaining access to the privilege and also

141
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,120
losing access to the identity. But these people don't care about that nuance.

142
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,640
Even though the exact same logic is used to say that you have white privilege,

143
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,240
even if you're not actually white, when you apply that same logic to bisexuality,

144
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,720
it's apparently completely offensive. Even though it is not only the same logic,

145
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,200
but confirmed by the real-life feminists that I know.

146
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,480
So far I've kind of been indulging myself here, and I think that's why I made this a

147
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,520
DevTrospective video instead of a main SFO video. Because I'm talking more off the cuff.

148
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,800
And I'm talking about stuff that's closer to me. This is a personal encounter. And by the way,

149
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,680
that is the reason why I censored everyone's names. I do not want you to go after these people.

150
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,240
I certainly do not want cancer culture to descend upon them. Although, as an aside,

151
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,800
would it surprise you to know that the person speaking in red, that this is who they are?

152
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,720
Yeah, I had a feeling like five years ago, the minute that that relationship started,

153
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,560
the friendship was over, unfortunately. It just took us this long to get there.

154
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,960
Okay, that was a little blow, I know, but that one was just for me personally.

155
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,120
And besides, we all know somebody like this, don't we? With the dyed hair and the glasses attempting

156
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,600
to appear unique, who talks about how progressive and moral they are, who talks about having the

157
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,280
right politics, but ultimately is just a cover for them being fundamentally a nasty person.

158
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:03,520
And believe it or not, this is not a video about me ranting about old friends. It's not. Because

159
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:09,760
I realized something while this was happening to me, that if these people had any actual power,

160
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:16,320
they would have wielded it against me. Because in this tiny space, where it's a discord of only a

161
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,200
few dozen people, they still couldn't resist doing what every single person does whenever

162
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,080
they engage in some kind of cancel culture nonsense. And I'm guilty of this too. I jumped

163
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,280
on the ProJared bandwagon last year, and I was wrong. I should not have done that. And that's

164
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:37,360
the main reason I'm refusing to jump on the Angry Joe bandwagon and the Twitch blackout people,

165
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,080
and all this stuff, all these accusations coming out right now. I will not. I will not make the

166
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,280
same mistake again. It was a moral failing on my part that I did that. And frankly,

167
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,320
but for the grace of God, go I. If these people who had thrown me out of their discord actually

168
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,440
had, say, millions of followers instead of a couple thousand or something, if they actually

169
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,320
had the ability to do so, if they actually had a presence, I do believe that there would have been

170
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,960
an attempt, partially organic and grassroots and partially not, to have me canceled over those old

171
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:15,840
ICE tweets. And then I had to ask myself, like, why do I care about being canceled so much? And

172
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,520
after thinking it through, I realized that I just don't anymore. It's as simple as that. I'm tired

173
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:27,120
of it. I'm tired of cancel culture. I'm tired of knee jerk reacting to everything. It's emotionally

174
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,720
draining. I'm tired of baselessly accusing people or adding to other people's accusations when

175
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,320
there's no solid proof behind them. It makes me feel immoral. I'm tired of being pressured to care

176
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,520
about stuff. Maybe it sounds selfish of me, but like, I have two people in my life who are very

177
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,960
close to me, who on some level, I am at least partially caring for. I'm working as hard as I

178
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,360
can, oftentimes more than 12 hours a day, every day at the YouTube thing, the streaming thing.

179
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,120
I know for some of you, it's your dream job. It's my dream job, too. I wouldn't trade it for the

180
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,600
world, but that's not to say that it's not work. Maybe I'm just a weakling, but it is somewhat

181
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,440
draining just to get through life sometimes. And I'm tired of being pressured to care about stuff

182
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,640
that on some level I just don't care about. And now I'm going to be canceled and called a bad

183
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,600
person, a racist, a Nazi, an alt writer, whatever, because I'm not caring in the right way. Because

184
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,200
I'm not posting hashtag black lives matter in my tweets. I'm not flying an LGBTQ flag. I'm not

185
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,880
changing my avatar to a black square or a COVID awareness banner or whatever the most recent social

186
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:35,120
media nonsense is. I'm tired of being forced to give a shit. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of being

187
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,160
told that my sense of humor is now no longer valid when those same people engaged in it 5 or

188
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,640
10 years ago. I'm tired of being told that my view on Islam is hateful and bigoted and xenophobic.

189
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,040
When the exact same people said the exact same thing about Christianity back during the Bush

190
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,440
and Obama years. I guess it's okay to discriminate against gay people if your skin is brown or

191
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,840
something. I still think edgy 4chan Newgrounds style humor is funny. And I'm tired of pretending

192
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:10,080
that I don't. I'm tired of being told that the mainstream center left positions that I

193
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:16,240
hold politically now make me a white nationalist and a Nazi. And the on the ground effect of all

194
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,360
of this stuff is cancel culture. For example, when the riots heated up in the United States,

195
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,520
Jon Tron posted this variant of the I just want to grill meme. The accompanying tweet said these

196
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,400
last few days along with everyone else have made me feel incredibly sad. Through these uncertain

197
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,120
times, I hope to bring laughter to your lives through my continued videos. Please stay safe

198
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,760
out there peace, a completely reasonable reaction, and the internet tried to cancel him over it

199
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,480
because he was not explicitly endorsing one point of view over another. Even though that's not his

200
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,080
job. He's an entertainer. He's not a political pundit. And here's his response to getting

201
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,680
canceled. What we're doing the COVID sequel already. Man, they're really just starting

202
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,440
to recycle ideas at this point. I'm just gonna go watch reruns of Occupy Wall Street.

203
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:04,560
And I get it. It's funny, but this is what he says to people trying to cancel him over being

204
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:10,400
politically neutral over staying in the center over not publicly grandstanding over not virtue

205
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,320
signaling. We all think virtue signaling is cringy as fuck. But when you don't do it,

206
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:21,040
they cancel you. This is a much politer version of that. That one Twitter video of the Joker getting

207
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,000
ready to say the N word and how much of a ridiculous build up it was to that same energy.

208
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,080
And it's the same energy because it is a complete and total disregard for the social norm. The new

209
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,280
social norm now is social justice oriented stuff. But it's a complete and total disregard for it.

210
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,640
In fact, back before the social justice warriors held political power, they got a kick out of

211
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,680
breaking the old social norm that was religious Christianity, you know, the the resurgent

212
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,800
religious Christian right that kind of ran things back in the 90s. The proto leftist back then

213
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,440
really reveled in being edgy and you know, tipping their four doors and stuff. This is the exact same

214
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,280
kind of thing. And it's why they hate john Trump. But this stuff is everywhere, man. And I'm just

215
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,240
tired of it. Nebraska Democrats renounced their Senate pick over his previous comments. Audio

216
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:12,640
emerges of Jimmy Kimmel allegedly using the N word back from 1996. Lana del Rey doja cat and

217
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,760
Jimmy Fallon have all been canceled in the past month. The account brother nature has a history

218
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,040
of racist tweets. It turns out those tweets happened when the person running the account

219
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:30,400
was 12 years old. Connor daily a NASCAR driver lost a sponsorship because of a racially insensitive

220
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,280
remark made not by him but by his father in the 1980s. And the left participates in it with glee.

221
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,360
Sometimes they even call for it to happen themselves. I'm sure this attempt here by

222
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,680
Christie winters didn't really go anywhere because Christie winters is a nobody, but they know exactly

223
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,320
what kind of power they wield. And it's not just grassroots. We also know that this sort of thing

224
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,400
is organized and corporate TV networks have enlisted p eyes to scour stars social media

225
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,600
for racism. They get clicks and therefore revenue when someone gets canceled. So of course they want

226
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,720
to push that shit. The left also knows to pick its targets. Well, here's Owen Jones, the UK's

227
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,960
resident bumbling idiot on the whole Yorkshire tea thing that was happening a little while ago.

228
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,080
Um, you're clearly all having fun, but this hashtag Sue you're shouting at tea thing is

229
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,320
really disturbing. I realize this will all make Yorkshire tea a lot of money, but picking on a

230
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,880
random member of the public being silly on Twitter, who we know nothing about and who sounds vulnerable.

231
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,840
Um, Oh, so you're against cancel culture then Owen? It sounds like it sounds like this random person

232
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,280
just made a weird tweet and now everyone is descending on them. Sounds bad. Yorkshire tea

233
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,480
have told a far right vlogger not to buy their tea again and enraged right wing extremists are

234
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,840
throwing theirs in the bin. You absolutely love to see it. Oh, so cancel culture is only valid

235
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,720
if you go after the right targets then Owen, is that it? I don't even know which far right vlogger

236
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,240
you're talking about, but I do not trust your opinion on what the far right actually is. But

237
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,760
more to the point of this video, cancel culture is valid if the target of cancel culture has the

238
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:08,000
wrong politics. From Dave Chappelle and Joe Rogan to Andy Ngo and Laura Loomer to Sargon and the

239
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,480
Ralph retort, cancel culture is wrong every single time it happens. Cancel culture is the tool of the

240
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,360
person who wants to hurt someone else, but they have no actual reason to do so. They have no

241
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,520
grievance, they haven't actually been harmed in any way. They can't bring something before a court,

242
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,080
they have no receipts to show, but they hate you. Maybe they're jealous of you. Maybe they think

243
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,240
you're a disgusting member of society and therefore you have to be purged, regardless of

244
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,240
the truth on that. Maybe it makes themself feel better to think they've done some good in the

245
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,000
world and frankly they don't feel good all that often so they're just going to take what they can

246
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,280
get. Maybe it just gives them that cathartic release that they've been searching for, just to

247
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,960
hate on somebody. Whatever it is, it's illegitimate. And worst of all, this is something that the left

248
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,680
actually fought against back when I was younger. It was the religious right that would employ a

249
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,760
variant of cancel culture. Did you know that you have a gay person working for you? Maybe you

250
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,760
should fire them. Maybe the children shouldn't be around them. Do you think it's appropriate after

251
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,640
9-11 to have a Muslim working in your shop? But nowadays cancel culture comes from the left,

252
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,880
as do those people that are now defending it. Critics of cancel culture really just hate

253
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,080
democracy. You are technically correct if we're talking about the mob rule style of democracy,

254
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:24,720
but there is no real justice in that. While our society rightly values protest and free expression,

255
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,600
the critics of cancel culture turn this virtue into a vice, contemptuously dismissing those

256
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,400
who collectively express their disapproval. This is not what's happening right now. People

257
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,160
are free to cancel whoever they like. That is the power of the consumer boycott. In essence,

258
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:46,400
Gamergate itself, back in the day, was cancel culture. And we can see just how badly the

259
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,800
progressives reacted to being cancelled back then. But the consumer boycott is one of the

260
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,920
only things that regular people can do to effect change in the marketplace. But I'm not talking

261
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:01,120
about that. I'm talking about what happens to people who have a neutral opinion, or who refuse

262
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,080
to act. The people who choose not to virtue signal. They get cancelled as well. I know I

263
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,960
keep resorting to the old well of horseshoe theory in this video, but it is very much like George

264
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,080
Bush saying you're either with us or against us. I remember very vividly the left decrying that when

265
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,560
it happened. But now that Bush is out of mind, they're doing the exact same thing. One of the

266
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:26,960
artists who works on my channel drew a gender-bent variant of PewDiePie. Yikes! It looks like I'm

267
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,440
taking a break from your shopping page. Of course you are. Sad, because I like their stuff, but

268
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,360
right along with you, how come you're ignoring everyone who has a good reason to be angry? No

269
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,520
one has a good reason to be angry. You're all stupid if you do. But liking everyone who supports

270
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,040
this awful person. There was no reply, so I believe I asked why you're ignoring people.

271
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:51,760
There is no legitimate reason to hate PewDiePie. He's not a Nazi. He's not an alt-rider. He's not

272
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:58,320
a white supremacist. Your real problem with Pewds is that he's edgier. He still behaves in some ways

273
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,080
like it's 2012 internet, just like I do. And because he won't take you and your politics 100%

274
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:10,480
seriously, he's evil. I kept frantically hoping she would like, catch every blatant hint people

275
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,360
were throwing that this shit is bad, but she's actively ignoring. I don't want to speak for her.

276
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:22,320
I would assume she just disagrees with you and thinks you are stupid. I'm really sad you are

277
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,600
supporting a racist anti-semitic alt-right edgelord. That's not kawaii at all. Please do

278
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,080
some research into this guy's history and even current news. Why do you support a neo-nazi who

279
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,960
not only backs the alt-right, but is anti-semitic, uses racial slurs against black people, and

280
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,640
inspired a large massacre against innocent brown Muslims? I thought this was a joke comment, but

281
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,280
it's actually real. Yes, he's a goddamn neo-nazi. This is the kind of content he's promoted. He

282
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,720
followed prominent members of the alt-right on Twitter and then unfollowed them to hide the

283
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,360
fact right after the massacre. You can't go around saying racist derogatory comments and jokes

284
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,440
against racial and religious groups and expect anything bad to come of it. This artist of mine

285
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,560
sent me a few more funny things. My mutuals, if you're following Shadbase or Sledbox, I'm

286
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,840
unfollowing. I adore y'all, but you have no reason to be following these toxic artists.

287
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,880
Of course it had to be fucking Shadbase, dude. This is a study from Cambridge titled Does

288
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,760
Apologizing Work? An Empirical Test of Conventional Wisdom. Let's read the abstract. Public figures

289
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,080
often apologize after making controversial statements. There are reasons to believe,

290
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,920
however, that apologizing makes public figures appear weak and risk-averse, which may make them

291
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,080
less likable and lead members of the public to actually want to punish them.

292
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,920
When presented with two versions of the controversy surrounding Larry Summers,

293
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,000
liberals and females were more likely to say that he should have faced negative consequences

294
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,120
for his statement when presented with his apology. The effects on other groups were smaller or

295
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,520
neutral. This suggests that when a prominent figure apologizes for a controversial statement,

296
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,560
individuals are either unaffected or become more likely to desire that the individual be punished.

297
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,400
It's a crazy study. It basically implies that apologizing for your edgy past doesn't

298
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,360
actually do anything. And in fact, to the exact demographic of people who are demanding your

299
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,720
apology, it lowers their opinion of you. I would like you to combine your knowledge of that study

300
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,600
now with this exchange on Twitter. This verified lefty decides to draw a comic about cancel culture

301
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,800
and very clearly he is disdainful of the idea that cancel culture is bad because he draws a comic

302
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:32,080
about a guy who he gets canceled and then he ends up kind of spinning his canceling into a career

303
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,560
and makes a whole bunch of money. The reply to that is, shouldn't this make you want to not

304
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,040
cancel people given that it's effectively amplifying their voices through channels that

305
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:47,600
take joy from their cancellation? And he simply replies, no. Cancel culture is not about doing

306
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,520
good. It is not about righting wrongs. It is not about making the world a better place. It's not

307
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:01,280
about education. It is about that cathartic release that a lefty feels when they've identified

308
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,080
somebody that they view to be impure and when they have, with their righteous indignation,

309
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,800
purged them for the good of their community. I can only assume that the Christians of old who

310
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,080
killed witches felt the exact same way when they did it. They had the perfect outlet for their

311
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,600
impotent hate and rage. They had a way to oppress other people within a framework that makes them

312
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,800
the victim. And they had the perfect moral cover to indulge in harming those around them.

313
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,960
See, I told you at the beginning, this wasn't just going to be a video about a personal event

314
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,400
that happened to me. It's really not about that. That was just my springboard into the larger

315
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,480
topic. My point with that was to show if those people had a large community and not a small one,

316
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,520
which is what they have, you might see an attempt to cancel me right now. And you know what? Here,

317
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,800
I'll just, I'll just make it easy for you. Take this and clip it. Maybe I'll even clip it on my

318
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,320
own channel just for convenience sake. If cancel culture ever comes for me, here in one little

319
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:01,440
package are all the hateful, terrible, racist, bigoted, misogynist, transphobic, xenophobic

320
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,600
things that I believe all in one go. Okay, here they are. I believe that gay people, trans people,

321
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:14,080
people of any race, of any ethnicity, of any religion deserve the same equal rights as anyone

322
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,360
else. That also means they have the same responsibility to uphold others' rights as

323
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,200
everyone else. Meaning that if you are a fanatic Muslim, no, you cannot simply kill gay people

324
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,520
because they have a right to life. I believe that trans people should be allowed to do whatever they

325
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,760
want. If they want to transition as adults, that's their business. They are legal adults.

326
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,400
They can do what they like. However, I believe that children should not be allowed to medically

327
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,360
transition with hormones until they turn 18, or at least the age of majority in your country.

328
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,680
We don't let kids make serious decisions until they're adults. I think the same standard should

329
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,880
apply with transitioning, and that does not make me transphobic. I believe that a liberal, free

330
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,080
society requires a strong border. I believe that illegal immigrants flooding into a country

331
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,960
depresses the value of labor in the market. Because why should a company pay you minimum wage

332
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,840
when they can hire an illegal for half that price? Therefore, I believe one of the best ways to help

333
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:13,920
the working class is to end illegal immigration, and enforce border laws. However, I don't want

334
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:20,480
those border laws enforced on a racial or ethnic basis. I am happy for any race, or any ethnicity,

335
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,160
or even any religion of person to come to the West and live in a Western country, as long as they do

336
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:32,880
so legally, and they do so with the intention of upholding our values. And probably most importantly

337
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,240
of all, I don't believe that hate speech should be censored. I believe that hate speech is properly

338
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,080
countered with more speech, with better speech, with competent debate. I believe that if you

339
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,040
censor hate speech, it's because you have no actual argument against it. And that means that

340
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:54,080
either you're shit at debating, which is possible, or that your ideas are even worse than the hate

341
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,440
speech that you're listening to. The leftists of my era understood that sunlight was the best

342
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,480
disinfectant, meaning that when you engage people with radical ideas rather than isolate them and

343
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,480
ban them from places, you end up de-radicalizing them, as long as your own ideas are actually sound.

344
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,680
In banning people from discords, in banning them from social media platforms, in canceling them

345
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,800
whenever something even minor happens, you are only serving to radicalize more people, not

346
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:27,600
de-radicalize them. Now, if everything that I've just said to the progressives in five or ten years

347
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,520
make me equal to Hitler himself, because things have just gone that crazy in the future,

348
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:40,640
then go ahead, cancel me. I don't fucking care anymore. But never, for the rest of my natural

349
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:47,040
life, will I walk back any of the things that I just said. The natural impulse is to do so,

350
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,800
you know, when you have a thousand people telling you that you fucked up, that you're the wrong one,

351
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,400
you know, the natural impulse is to say, oh man, with that many people, maybe I did,

352
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,760
maybe I did make a big mistake, like am I wrong here? I don't want to be wrong,

353
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,640
I don't want to be acting immoral, did I actually hurt somebody? Nobody wants to be the person that

354
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,520
hurt an innocent. I understand that, but we're past that point now. We are at the point where

355
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,680
if you don't have the right politics, if you are neutral to what they consider to be evil,

356
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:21,040
if you even simply stay silent and don't virtue signal, they consider you to be as evil as the

357
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:26,640
original evil that they claim to fight. That is unacceptable, and I will not be a part of it.
