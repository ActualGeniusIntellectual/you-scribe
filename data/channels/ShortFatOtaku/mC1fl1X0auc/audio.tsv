0	12700	When that comic that was the starting point of the last video went viral, there was actually a pretty common progressive defense for its attitude.
12700	25700	Just in case you missed that video very quickly then, the centrist says both sides have good points, the leftist gets angry and attacks the centrist who falls into the right's camp, the rightist helps him up, and the leftist asks him why he's siding with the bad guys.
25900	40900	The progressive defense of this, and has been for some time as far as I can tell, is that the left and right are fundamentally different, that the left-right scale is actually a good-evil scale, where the more left you are, it's not only that you're more factually correct, but also more moral and virtuous.
40900	53500	This is wrong for obvious reasons, and if progressives actually believed this, then there would be no reason not to engage in total war with not only the right, but with those leftists who aren't left enough, again, the purity spiral from the last video.
53500	64500	Their position is distilled nicely by a boy motor supreme here. The left, we should improve society somewhat. The right, we should expel all minorities and accelerate the rate at which we destroy the planet.
64500	77500	Both sides make a good argument. The problem with this critique is that it's assuming the absolute worst rightist position is the default rightist position. Let's give the devil his due, that worst position does exist, but it's not the whole of the right.
77500	86500	And on the other side, well, I would say it assumes the absolute best leftist position, but we should improve society somewhat is rather anemic, isn't it?
86500	94500	I don't think this passage is the most positive possible interpretation of leftism. I actually think there's better ones, but I guess this person doesn't think highly of their own movement.
94500	106500	Now see, I could flip it around. I could say something like, the right, we should give people the freedom to own property and live private lives, and the left, we should steal everybody's shit, riot and burn cities down, enforce a communist revolution on the people.
106500	114500	It's easy to point at the worst of your opponent while presenting the best you have to offer and then declare yourself morally superior, but that's not the whole story.
114500	126500	However, downstream from this left is defined as good and right as evil attitude is the planist position. You know how the left was presented as we should improve society somewhat? That belies the planist mindset.
126500	137500	Planism initially referred to planned markets, meaning rather than supply and demand determining the flow of goods, and rather than the individual private owners of businesses providing these goods, the government plans the economy.
137500	145500	The government determines what is produced and how much, the government sets the prices, and the government sells the goods, all without a feedback mechanism from the people who buy the goods.
145500	158500	In my housing video I go over how, in a liberal society, the market feedback mechanism of items sold per price and location allows the sellers of at least some products to adjust production and allocation based on those sales figures.
158500	166500	A planned economy lacks these feedback mechanisms, which is why both the Soviet states and the fascist states had more inefficient economies.
166500	175500	But in a more general sense, the concept of planism implies a belief that if you just have enough top down, or even middle management or oversight, you can solve any problem.
175500	192500	This isn't without its merits, obviously some projects require large scale coordination or a big picture vision, but there's also the possibility of having too many cooks, too many middle managers who don't contribute anything worthwhile, too many far flung bureaucrats who know nothing about the situation on the ground, deciding things they have no knowledge or experience about.
192500	199500	If you unpack the phrase, we should improve society somewhat, you have to ask, what is improvement? And who is the we?
199500	204500	Most leftists would likely say something like, the people, collectively, should work to make society better.
204500	210500	Where better generally means whatever pet projects the speaker personally believes in, whether or not most people agree with them.
210500	214500	Just to be clear, I'm not arguing against the concept of improvement itself, I'm not a postmodernist.
214500	220500	But a lot of leftism seems to boil down to big ideas that somebody else will do the hard work of implementing.
220500	232500	And downstream from, I guess we'll call it, a neo-planist mindset, is the idea that everything matters, and so every wasted second, every lost opportunity, is a permanent setback on the road to utopia.
232500	235500	The thing is, that's actually correct.
235500	243500	Consider it like this, let's say I tell you, you have to run a marathon in six months, and let's say you're a fat slob right now who has to lose a whole bunch of weight.
243500	248500	Well, you've got 180 days to prepare, that's 4320 hours.
248500	253500	Let's say you spend one third of that sleeping eight hours a day, that's 1440 hours gone.
253500	257500	You work eight hours a day for five days a week, that's 10,040 hours gone.
257500	261500	That leaves you with 1840 hours left to train.
261500	268500	The average person who jogs for an hour burns about 550 calories, and one pound of pure body fat is 3500 calories.
268500	278500	Working all the math out on that, if you jogged for each one of those 1840 free hours, you'll lose about 290 pounds of body fat across the six months, just from jogging.
278500	288500	There's obviously a billion problems with this math, I'm not including dieting, I'm not including metabolic changes that happen during weight loss, or muscle loss as a result of extreme working out, or physical fatigue, or demoralization.
288500	293500	But the point I'm making is, if your time is finite, and it is, and you have a goal with a time limit, and you do,
293500	299500	with enough data you can actually calculate out the theoretical maximum amount of progress you can make on the goal before time is up.
299500	302500	In this way, the neo-planist position is correct.
302500	307500	Read the memoir of any CEO, or any athlete, or any president, or any successful person.
307500	311500	They all think like this. It's what the sigma grind set meme makes fun of.
311500	313500	When Jordan Peterson says,
313500	317500	You want to have a meaningful life? Everything you do matters.
317500	319500	That's the definition of a meaningful life.
319500	323500	But everything you do matters. You're going to have to carry that with you.
323500	331500	The natural end result of that position, even as the position is great for getting you to take responsibility for your life, is the neo-planist position.
331500	334500	But the problem you inevitably counter is the public-private split.
334500	342500	When the future CEO, or athlete, or president, wakes up at 4am every day to work his butt off, he's understanding that his time is finite.
342500	347500	He has from now until his death to accomplish his goals, and he's not wasting a minute of it.
347500	351500	One second lost may be an opportunity lost, but he's doing it for him, for his goals.
351500	358500	He may seek to eventually improve society through his work, but he's not seeking to force others to wake up at 4am every day and grind it out as hard as he is.
358500	360500	Can the socialist say the same thing?
360500	370500	The socialist position is that society must be radically transformed, that liberalism must be overthrown, capitalism must be smashed, the market must be abolished, products must be decommodified.
370500	381500	It's not hard to see how, downstream from this political position, is the idea that every second of everybody's life be allocated as efficiently as possible to achieve these goals, because ethically they're just that important.
381500	388500	It's not hard to see how this ceases to be the individual choosing to wake up at 4am to grind it out, and a totalitarian body planning everybody's lives.
388500	390500	You've surely seen this phrase before.
390500	392500	Everything is political.
392500	393500	We've been dealing with it for a decade now.
393500	396500	Even longer still if you took gender studies classes in the 2000s like I did.
396500	397500	Pac-Man is political.
397500	399500	Star Trek is political.
399500	400500	ector is political.
400500	401500	Traffic signals are political.
401500	402500	Neckties are political.
402500	403500	Hiking is political.
403500	405500	Smiling is political.
405500	406500	Opening schools is political.
406500	408500	Closing schools is political.
408500	409500	Food is political.
409500	410500	Streets are political.
410500	411500	Teaching is political.
411500	413500	Art is political.
413500	415500	Nickelodeon The Kids' Channel is political.
415500	418500	Botany, uh sorry, ethnobotany is political.
418500	420500	S socks are political.
420500	422500	Outdoor equipment is political.
422500	423500	Smutty card games are political.
423500	424500	Enterprise software is political.
424500	426500	The dictionary is political.
426500	427500	Coffee is political.
427500	428500	Yogurt is political.
428500	433220	yogurt is political. I know a lot of these examples say racist or sexist instead of political
433220	445300	but this is the generalization of the theme. You've heard the Anita Sarkeesian clip right?
445300	449220	This is what is meant by everything is political. To describe it in the leftist tongue, everything
449220	453100	is wrapped up in systems of oppression. Everything can be examined critically and the bigotry
453100	458200	sussed out. Everything impacts people in not just an everyday way but a collective, society-wide
458400	462920	and so everything is political. While some of these examples are obviously stupid, streets
462920	468520	are not black out of hatred of black people, Karen. Like the neo-planist position and unfortunately
468520	473240	for the liberal position, the underlying ethic is once again true. Everything actually can
473240	477120	be political. The coffee in your kitchen is simply a drink you buy at the store and then
477120	481240	have when it suits you. But it's also where it came from. Was slave labour involved in
481240	485360	its creation? Were those workers compensated fairly? Are there injustices that forced those
485360	489400	workers into that position? In the trade deal that was worked out between two governments
489400	493080	to get that coffee from that country to your kitchen was part of the deal fucking over
493080	497640	somebody else somewhere else. This is a political way of viewing coffee. The progressives are
497640	501560	correct. But what they're missing again is the public-private split. They're missing
501560	505800	that liberal society allows people to have a private life. Here's a great example. Nestle
505800	510000	is a shitty company. I try not to buy Nestle for that reason alone but you know what? Drumstick
510000	513360	ice cream cones are just really fucking good. And every once in a while I'll pick one up
513360	516760	from the store. I don't do it all the time but I'm also not willing to rake myself
516760	520480	over the coals over it because everything is political and I need to stick to my principles
520480	523920	all the time or I'm a raging hypocrite. Sticking to your principles is important. Don't
523920	527640	get me wrong. But I also understand that everybody has a cheat meal once in a while. People can
527640	532040	relax a bit if the stakes are low. Not everybody has to be turned on all the time and expecting
532040	535160	them to be is a bit ridiculous, isn't it? Where it counts you should certainly stick
535160	538360	to your principles. I'm never taking a Nestle sponsorship for example. They can go fuck
538360	541860	themselves. But the private life is a place where you don't have to be political. Where
541860	545320	you can recharge your batteries and chill for a little while. To the socialist, whose
545320	550700	view is totalizing, whose ethic is neo-planist, and whose position is that everything is political,
550700	554540	do you think you'd be allowed to live that private life in their world? Do you think
554540	559380	you'd ever be able to just chill out? Because everything is political, suddenly when it's
559380	563420	somebody else's politics on display, the socialists have no choice but to freak out.
563420	567020	A German far right group is trying to recruit kids with a free video game. Death Stranding
567020	571040	is queerphobic and promotes rape culture. Studio Ghibli has failed to deal with Japanese
571040	576500	imperialism in its bright, colorful escapist movies. Six Days in Fallujah needs to be deplatformed
576500	580540	and blocked because it normalizes and promotes the mass murder of Iraqis. Don't play This
580540	584280	Land is My Land because they don't have Native American representation on their development
584280	588600	team. Most people's knee-jerk reactions to these freak-outs is to laugh at them and
588600	592960	say, well, I thought everything was political. Maybe they view these individuals as so joyless
592960	596920	and obsessed with politics that the idea of media that doesn't explicitly address the
596920	600140	political is worthless to them. And sure, for a lot of brain-dead progs marching in
600140	604200	lockstep with the approved points of view, they probably do view it as shallowly as this.
604200	608020	But that's not the ideological core of the ethic being presented here. If everything
608020	611580	is political, and their politics are all about saving the world and creating the utopia,
611580	616460	then every moment and every space must be turned towards their politics. Every moment
616460	620860	where socialism isn't being discussed, every space where socialism isn't present, is
620860	626120	a direct setback. And therefore these people view a mandate to fix it. This is a totalizing
626120	631380	worldview. By design, it leaves nothing out. No private life. No moment where you can disengage.
631380	635900	Be off for a while. Step away from the eternal struggle and just live life. Even though everything
635900	639720	may be political, you can still have places and times where things aren't. Coffee might
639720	642520	be political, but it doesn't mean that there's not a time and place where you just say fuck
642520	646880	it and enjoy your cup of coffee on some pleasant spring morning with your partner. Movies might
646880	650720	be political, but you can still say not today and snuggle up on the couch with somebody
650720	653880	and watch one for fun. Games might be political, but sometimes you just want to play them with
653880	658280	your friends. To the socialist, this view is a waste of precious resources, precious
658280	663080	time, precious space. But to the liberal, this is what makes life worth living. This
663080	668280	divide between the liberal ethic and the socialist one is why you routinely see stuff like this
668280	673360	happen. When base camp banned political speech at their work, regardless of political denomination,
673360	677920	they lost one third of their employees. One of those former employees said on Twitter,
677920	681660	we just ask that if you want to work here, you leave behind everything that makes you
681660	686360	human at the door. These people actually believe their politics is what makes them
686360	692620	human and not those private anti politic moments like drinking coffee with their spouse. Imagine
692620	696900	the mindset you have to have to think like this. Imagine thinking that politics is what
696900	701580	makes you human rather than your humanity making you political. That mindset is best
701580	706300	described by another common leftist phrase, the personal is political. This view flies
706300	710420	in the face of the liberal ethic on privacy. We can accept that everything may have a political
710420	714380	component, but also that there is a time and place to deal with those politics. Addressing
714380	718220	the politics of coffee can be done at another time, not the morning coffee with your partner.
718220	722140	The liberal respects the distinction between the public and the private, between the political
722140	725580	and the personal for this reason. It gives people the space to be people rather than
725580	730700	always on, always emoting politotrons. But just as importantly, it provides the moral
730700	734660	foundations for the limits of state power. If we accept that we have a private personal
734660	738700	life away from political engagement, then it stands to reason that barring the occurrence
738700	742260	of a violent crime or something, that is a realm in which the state has no business
742260	747180	butting in. For example, back during Canada's push to decriminalize homosexuality, Prime
747180	751260	Minister Pierre Trudeau said it best, there is no place for the state in the bedrooms
751260	755900	of the nation. That is an appeal to the personal, to the private life existing outside of the
755900	759800	state's purview. But if everything is political, then certainly the personal is political.
759800	764380	And if the personal is political, then every personal act is also a political act. And
764380	768860	if every act is a political act, then every act is the concern of the state, because the
768860	770860	political is the concern of the state.
770860	774020	If you've noticed that this is starting to sound like classical fascism, you'd be
774020	778660	correct. Mussolini's most famous quote, all within the state, nothing outside the
778660	782240	state, nothing against the state certainly applies here, but it runs deeper than that.
782240	786880	The fascist conception of the state is all embracing, outside of it no human or spiritual
786880	792500	values can exist, much less have value. This understood, fascism is totalitarian, and the
792500	798220	state, a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values, interprets, develops, and potentiates
798220	799580	the whole life of a people.
799580	803040	The people we're dealing with believe that the personal is political, that everything
803040	807620	is political and must be treated as such, that the private life is something to be scorned.
807620	811100	Just talk to any socialist about something like private ownership, and watch them reject
811100	813300	the liberal values of privacy and consent.
813300	816620	I'm sure at this point I don't need to quote Marx's rejection of liberal privacy
816620	819860	again. I've done it about five times now in different videos, you know the drill at
819860	820860	this point.
820860	824900	Mussolini mentioned synthesis in that quote for a specific reason. Giovanni Gentile, the
824900	829100	philosopher of fascism, was a neo-Hegelian, and in the Hegelian tradition, believed that
829100	833340	a fascist society would necessarily include a synthesis of public and private life, with
833340	838260	the socialist's publicness arising as the antithesis to the liberal's thesis of privateness.
838260	842340	The fascists viewed the distinction between public and private life as non-existent, imposed
842340	846100	by the liberal government, but not actually a real thing. This sounds a lot like the progressive
846100	849380	everything is political position, like the socialist everything must be turned towards
849380	853860	praxis position. What binds these philosophies together is that they are all totalitarian,
853860	857300	and I'm using that word properly to mean a political philosophy that concerns itself
857300	861500	with the total of everything. It is totalizing. There is nothing that exists that the philosophy
861500	866460	considers to be neutral, or unaligned, or outside of its scope. Fascism and socialism,
866460	870860	progressivism and Marxism, all view themselves as complete theories, and therefore there
870860	875100	is no topic in which they have no position. This is not the liberal point of view. For
875100	878860	the liberal, a lot of things are personal. For the liberal, a lot of things are private.
878860	882460	For the liberal, there is a whole section of life where the state's position should
882460	887700	be, do what you want, it's none of my business. A totalitarian philosophy can't tolerate
887700	891860	that appeal to privacy. It's a big part of why socialists don't understand consent,
891860	896540	because consent is fundamentally a private matter. If everything can be political, the
896540	900180	liberal position that allows for a private life is important to being able to actually
900180	905040	live as a human being. These same people who demand that everything be political, are paradoxically
905040	908800	ranting about the violence of speech, or the trauma of mental health issues, even as
908800	912400	their totalizing worldview causes a lot of that shit, or at least makes it a whole lot
912400	915760	worse. These same people who demand that the personal is political, are now shocked to
915760	919840	learn that politics has a profit motive, and rage at what they view as their personal getting
919840	923280	sold out because it's political now, and there's money to be made. These same people
923280	927960	who think that all media, all art, all video games, etc, are political, genuinely believe
927960	932120	that using political themes or engaging in political drama to tell a story, is the same
932120	936320	thing as shoehorning in their contemporary politics in order to push a particular stance
936320	939960	onto the audience, because the creator thinks that this property they've inherited would
939960	944120	make a great soapbox. These same people who talk about the value of the community, who
944120	948560	appeal to the community's greater needs and collective wisdom all the time, also paradoxically
948560	952040	consider the liberal position of, I can get along with people who have different opinions,
952040	956640	to be a personal attack against them, because for them, politics is a zero sum game. And
956640	960040	that brings us back around to the beginning, where no difference can be tolerated, where
960040	963880	the socialist struggle is so real, that if you side with red you're evil even if it's
963880	967480	blue who pushed you there. My good friend and podcast co-host, Lilith
967480	971840	Lovett, said it best, they don't want politics in games, they want preachy indoctrination
971840	975700	courses that confirm their pre-established worldview. A handjob from the author telling
975700	978740	them they're right and everybody else is wrong. They're upset that not every form
978740	983200	of media is propaganda for their cause. If your position is a totalitarian one, that's
983200	988900	how it has to be. Every quiet, peaceful moment is an opportunity to advance towards the utopia.
988900	994160	Every apolitical space is fertile soil to be seeded with ideology. Every liberal insistence
994160	997520	on the sanctity of the private life is an affront to their collective march towards
997520	1002900	whatever they've arbitrarily deemed as progress. Sean, formerly of Sean and Jen fame back before
1002900	1007740	she took the Twitch channel, had this interesting conversation with Big Joel. Sean says, I've
1007740	1010740	interacted with a few right-wing internet personalities behind the scenes, asking me
1010740	1014420	to do debates, and it's always striking how polite and business-like they are. This
1014420	1018540	is not a compliment. Joel responds with, when Sargon wanted to talk to me he was so
1018540	1022500	polite and seemed vaguely affronted by my privately saying I don't respect him or
1022500	1026220	the work he does. Genuinely one of the more puzzling moments of my life. Because to these
1026220	1029800	people the personal is political, we can actually deduce a couple of things about them from
1029800	1034120	this short exchange. 1. They cannot conceive of the private, personal life. They don't
1034120	1037460	know why people would be polite to them on a personal level, but still disagree politically.
1037460	1041460	It's an alien concept to them. If every moment in every space must be filled with
1041460	1045460	praxis, and if you're talking to an evil reactionary counter-revolutionary alt-right
1045460	1051020	maga nazi chud, then even that private moment of discussion must be a place where your politics
1051020	1055580	shine through. Your totalitarian worldview demands it. This is why Sean thinks this is
1055580	1059660	not a compliment, that somebody would be polite to him if they happen to disagree. His politics
1059660	1064880	matters more than the private life. 2. If the personal is political, and they act this
1064880	1068780	toxically towards people on a personal level, what does that have to say about the toxicity
1068780	1074220	of their politics? If Sargon is kind to Joel personally, what does that say about his politics?
1074220	1079760	If Joel is cruel in return, what does that say about his? If every act truly is a theoretical
1079760	1083300	piece of political legislation, what does that say about the type of society that somebody
1083300	1087660	like Sean or Joel would implement if given the power? What type of person views their
1087660	1091460	interpersonal connections as expressions of politics? I hear a lot from leftoids about
1091460	1095060	how people who have been left behind by the left, people who have left the left because
1095060	1098500	leftists were mean to them, have no principles at all because if you truly cared about your
1098500	1102240	politics you wouldn't give them up for such shallow reasons as somebody was mean to me.
1102240	1107140	But if the personal is political, then what does this personal toxic treatment by leftists
1107140	1111820	say about the left's politics? A private life is something every human needs to have. A
1111820	1115660	place where you are not a political agent. A place where you can relax and enjoy your
1115660	1120080	friends or your family or your hobbies. A place where, regardless of the world raging
1120080	1124780	on the outside, you can retreat to and live quietly in peace. This is an essential component
1124780	1128640	of liberal political thought, that there is a time and place for politics and that
1128640	1133460	time is not all the time, that place is not every place. But the totalitarian worldview
1133460	1138700	of the left cannot abide by this. To them a private life is an attack on their ideology
1138700	1143020	because their ideology considers all places and all times as needing to be turned towards
1143020	1147380	them. If, in order to be a leftist, I must reject the liberal idea that there are times
1147380	1151940	and places in which politics are inappropriate, then I cannot be part of the left. I just
1151940	1156300	find it ironic that for as much as they cry out for safe spaces everywhere, a safe space
1156300	1179660	from politics is the one they reject.
