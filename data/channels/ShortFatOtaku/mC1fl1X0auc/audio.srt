1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,700
When that comic that was the starting point of the last video went viral, there was actually a pretty common progressive defense for its attitude.

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:25,700
Just in case you missed that video very quickly then, the centrist says both sides have good points, the leftist gets angry and attacks the centrist who falls into the right's camp, the rightist helps him up, and the leftist asks him why he's siding with the bad guys.

3
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:40,900
The progressive defense of this, and has been for some time as far as I can tell, is that the left and right are fundamentally different, that the left-right scale is actually a good-evil scale, where the more left you are, it's not only that you're more factually correct, but also more moral and virtuous.

4
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:53,500
This is wrong for obvious reasons, and if progressives actually believed this, then there would be no reason not to engage in total war with not only the right, but with those leftists who aren't left enough, again, the purity spiral from the last video.

5
00:00:53,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Their position is distilled nicely by a boy motor supreme here. The left, we should improve society somewhat. The right, we should expel all minorities and accelerate the rate at which we destroy the planet.

6
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Both sides make a good argument. The problem with this critique is that it's assuming the absolute worst rightist position is the default rightist position. Let's give the devil his due, that worst position does exist, but it's not the whole of the right.

7
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:26,500
And on the other side, well, I would say it assumes the absolute best leftist position, but we should improve society somewhat is rather anemic, isn't it?

8
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:34,500
I don't think this passage is the most positive possible interpretation of leftism. I actually think there's better ones, but I guess this person doesn't think highly of their own movement.

9
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Now see, I could flip it around. I could say something like, the right, we should give people the freedom to own property and live private lives, and the left, we should steal everybody's shit, riot and burn cities down, enforce a communist revolution on the people.

10
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:54,500
It's easy to point at the worst of your opponent while presenting the best you have to offer and then declare yourself morally superior, but that's not the whole story.

11
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:06,500
However, downstream from this left is defined as good and right as evil attitude is the planist position. You know how the left was presented as we should improve society somewhat? That belies the planist mindset.

12
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Planism initially referred to planned markets, meaning rather than supply and demand determining the flow of goods, and rather than the individual private owners of businesses providing these goods, the government plans the economy.

13
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:25,500
The government determines what is produced and how much, the government sets the prices, and the government sells the goods, all without a feedback mechanism from the people who buy the goods.

14
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:38,500
In my housing video I go over how, in a liberal society, the market feedback mechanism of items sold per price and location allows the sellers of at least some products to adjust production and allocation based on those sales figures.

15
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:46,500
A planned economy lacks these feedback mechanisms, which is why both the Soviet states and the fascist states had more inefficient economies.

16
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:55,500
But in a more general sense, the concept of planism implies a belief that if you just have enough top down, or even middle management or oversight, you can solve any problem.

17
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:12,500
This isn't without its merits, obviously some projects require large scale coordination or a big picture vision, but there's also the possibility of having too many cooks, too many middle managers who don't contribute anything worthwhile, too many far flung bureaucrats who know nothing about the situation on the ground, deciding things they have no knowledge or experience about.

18
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:19,500
If you unpack the phrase, we should improve society somewhat, you have to ask, what is improvement? And who is the we?

19
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Most leftists would likely say something like, the people, collectively, should work to make society better.

20
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,500
Where better generally means whatever pet projects the speaker personally believes in, whether or not most people agree with them.

21
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Just to be clear, I'm not arguing against the concept of improvement itself, I'm not a postmodernist.

22
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,500
But a lot of leftism seems to boil down to big ideas that somebody else will do the hard work of implementing.

23
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:52,500
And downstream from, I guess we'll call it, a neo-planist mindset, is the idea that everything matters, and so every wasted second, every lost opportunity, is a permanent setback on the road to utopia.

24
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,500
The thing is, that's actually correct.

25
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Consider it like this, let's say I tell you, you have to run a marathon in six months, and let's say you're a fat slob right now who has to lose a whole bunch of weight.

26
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Well, you've got 180 days to prepare, that's 4320 hours.

27
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Let's say you spend one third of that sleeping eight hours a day, that's 1440 hours gone.

28
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,500
You work eight hours a day for five days a week, that's 10,040 hours gone.

29
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,500
That leaves you with 1840 hours left to train.

30
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:28,500
The average person who jogs for an hour burns about 550 calories, and one pound of pure body fat is 3500 calories.

31
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Working all the math out on that, if you jogged for each one of those 1840 free hours, you'll lose about 290 pounds of body fat across the six months, just from jogging.

32
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:48,500
There's obviously a billion problems with this math, I'm not including dieting, I'm not including metabolic changes that happen during weight loss, or muscle loss as a result of extreme working out, or physical fatigue, or demoralization.

33
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,500
But the point I'm making is, if your time is finite, and it is, and you have a goal with a time limit, and you do,

34
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:59,500
with enough data you can actually calculate out the theoretical maximum amount of progress you can make on the goal before time is up.

35
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,500
In this way, the neo-planist position is correct.

36
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Read the memoir of any CEO, or any athlete, or any president, or any successful person.

37
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,500
They all think like this. It's what the sigma grind set meme makes fun of.

38
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
When Jordan Peterson says,

39
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,500
You want to have a meaningful life? Everything you do matters.

40
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
That's the definition of a meaningful life.

41
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,500
But everything you do matters. You're going to have to carry that with you.

42
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:31,500
The natural end result of that position, even as the position is great for getting you to take responsibility for your life, is the neo-planist position.

43
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,500
But the problem you inevitably counter is the public-private split.

44
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:42,500
When the future CEO, or athlete, or president, wakes up at 4am every day to work his butt off, he's understanding that his time is finite.

45
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,500
He has from now until his death to accomplish his goals, and he's not wasting a minute of it.

46
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,500
One second lost may be an opportunity lost, but he's doing it for him, for his goals.

47
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:58,500
He may seek to eventually improve society through his work, but he's not seeking to force others to wake up at 4am every day and grind it out as hard as he is.

48
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Can the socialist say the same thing?

49
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:10,500
The socialist position is that society must be radically transformed, that liberalism must be overthrown, capitalism must be smashed, the market must be abolished, products must be decommodified.

50
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:21,500
It's not hard to see how, downstream from this political position, is the idea that every second of everybody's life be allocated as efficiently as possible to achieve these goals, because ethically they're just that important.

51
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:28,500
It's not hard to see how this ceases to be the individual choosing to wake up at 4am to grind it out, and a totalitarian body planning everybody's lives.

52
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
You've surely seen this phrase before.

53
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Everything is political.

54
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
We've been dealing with it for a decade now.

55
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Even longer still if you took gender studies classes in the 2000s like I did.

56
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Pac-Man is political.

57
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Star Trek is political.

58
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
ector is political.

59
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Traffic signals are political.

60
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Neckties are political.

61
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Hiking is political.

62
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Smiling is political.

63
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Opening schools is political.

64
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Closing schools is political.

65
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Food is political.

66
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Streets are political.

67
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Teaching is political.

68
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Art is political.

69
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Nickelodeon The Kids' Channel is political.

70
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Botany, uh sorry, ethnobotany is political.

71
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
S socks are political.

72
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Outdoor equipment is political.

73
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Smutty card games are political.

74
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Enterprise software is political.

75
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
The dictionary is political.

76
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Coffee is political.

77
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Yogurt is political.

78
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,220
yogurt is political. I know a lot of these examples say racist or sexist instead of political

79
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:25,300
but this is the generalization of the theme. You've heard the Anita Sarkeesian clip right?

80
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,220
This is what is meant by everything is political. To describe it in the leftist tongue, everything

81
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,100
is wrapped up in systems of oppression. Everything can be examined critically and the bigotry

82
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,200
sussed out. Everything impacts people in not just an everyday way but a collective, society-wide

83
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,920
and so everything is political. While some of these examples are obviously stupid, streets

84
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,520
are not black out of hatred of black people, Karen. Like the neo-planist position and unfortunately

85
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,240
for the liberal position, the underlying ethic is once again true. Everything actually can

86
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,120
be political. The coffee in your kitchen is simply a drink you buy at the store and then

87
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,240
have when it suits you. But it's also where it came from. Was slave labour involved in

88
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,360
its creation? Were those workers compensated fairly? Are there injustices that forced those

89
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,400
workers into that position? In the trade deal that was worked out between two governments

90
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,080
to get that coffee from that country to your kitchen was part of the deal fucking over

91
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,640
somebody else somewhere else. This is a political way of viewing coffee. The progressives are

92
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,560
correct. But what they're missing again is the public-private split. They're missing

93
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,800
that liberal society allows people to have a private life. Here's a great example. Nestle

94
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,000
is a shitty company. I try not to buy Nestle for that reason alone but you know what? Drumstick

95
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,360
ice cream cones are just really fucking good. And every once in a while I'll pick one up

96
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,760
from the store. I don't do it all the time but I'm also not willing to rake myself

97
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,480
over the coals over it because everything is political and I need to stick to my principles

98
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,920
all the time or I'm a raging hypocrite. Sticking to your principles is important. Don't

99
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,640
get me wrong. But I also understand that everybody has a cheat meal once in a while. People can

100
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,040
relax a bit if the stakes are low. Not everybody has to be turned on all the time and expecting

101
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,160
them to be is a bit ridiculous, isn't it? Where it counts you should certainly stick

102
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,360
to your principles. I'm never taking a Nestle sponsorship for example. They can go fuck

103
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,860
themselves. But the private life is a place where you don't have to be political. Where

104
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,320
you can recharge your batteries and chill for a little while. To the socialist, whose

105
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,700
view is totalizing, whose ethic is neo-planist, and whose position is that everything is political,

106
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,540
do you think you'd be allowed to live that private life in their world? Do you think

107
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,380
you'd ever be able to just chill out? Because everything is political, suddenly when it's

108
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,420
somebody else's politics on display, the socialists have no choice but to freak out.

109
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,020
A German far right group is trying to recruit kids with a free video game. Death Stranding

110
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,040
is queerphobic and promotes rape culture. Studio Ghibli has failed to deal with Japanese

111
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,500
imperialism in its bright, colorful escapist movies. Six Days in Fallujah needs to be deplatformed

112
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,540
and blocked because it normalizes and promotes the mass murder of Iraqis. Don't play This

113
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,280
Land is My Land because they don't have Native American representation on their development

114
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,600
team. Most people's knee-jerk reactions to these freak-outs is to laugh at them and

115
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,960
say, well, I thought everything was political. Maybe they view these individuals as so joyless

116
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,920
and obsessed with politics that the idea of media that doesn't explicitly address the

117
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,140
political is worthless to them. And sure, for a lot of brain-dead progs marching in

118
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,200
lockstep with the approved points of view, they probably do view it as shallowly as this.

119
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,020
But that's not the ideological core of the ethic being presented here. If everything

120
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,580
is political, and their politics are all about saving the world and creating the utopia,

121
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,460
then every moment and every space must be turned towards their politics. Every moment

122
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,860
where socialism isn't being discussed, every space where socialism isn't present, is

123
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:26,120
a direct setback. And therefore these people view a mandate to fix it. This is a totalizing

124
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,380
worldview. By design, it leaves nothing out. No private life. No moment where you can disengage.

125
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,900
Be off for a while. Step away from the eternal struggle and just live life. Even though everything

126
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,720
may be political, you can still have places and times where things aren't. Coffee might

127
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,520
be political, but it doesn't mean that there's not a time and place where you just say fuck

128
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,880
it and enjoy your cup of coffee on some pleasant spring morning with your partner. Movies might

129
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,720
be political, but you can still say not today and snuggle up on the couch with somebody

130
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,880
and watch one for fun. Games might be political, but sometimes you just want to play them with

131
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,280
your friends. To the socialist, this view is a waste of precious resources, precious

132
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,080
time, precious space. But to the liberal, this is what makes life worth living. This

133
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,280
divide between the liberal ethic and the socialist one is why you routinely see stuff like this

134
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,360
happen. When base camp banned political speech at their work, regardless of political denomination,

135
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,920
they lost one third of their employees. One of those former employees said on Twitter,

136
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,660
we just ask that if you want to work here, you leave behind everything that makes you

137
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,360
human at the door. These people actually believe their politics is what makes them

138
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,620
human and not those private anti politic moments like drinking coffee with their spouse. Imagine

139
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,900
the mindset you have to have to think like this. Imagine thinking that politics is what

140
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,580
makes you human rather than your humanity making you political. That mindset is best

141
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,300
described by another common leftist phrase, the personal is political. This view flies

142
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,420
in the face of the liberal ethic on privacy. We can accept that everything may have a political

143
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,380
component, but also that there is a time and place to deal with those politics. Addressing

144
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,220
the politics of coffee can be done at another time, not the morning coffee with your partner.

145
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,140
The liberal respects the distinction between the public and the private, between the political

146
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,580
and the personal for this reason. It gives people the space to be people rather than

147
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,700
always on, always emoting politotrons. But just as importantly, it provides the moral

148
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,660
foundations for the limits of state power. If we accept that we have a private personal

149
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,700
life away from political engagement, then it stands to reason that barring the occurrence

150
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,260
of a violent crime or something, that is a realm in which the state has no business

151
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,180
butting in. For example, back during Canada's push to decriminalize homosexuality, Prime

152
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,260
Minister Pierre Trudeau said it best, there is no place for the state in the bedrooms

153
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,900
of the nation. That is an appeal to the personal, to the private life existing outside of the

154
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,800
state's purview. But if everything is political, then certainly the personal is political.

155
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,380
And if the personal is political, then every personal act is also a political act. And

156
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,860
if every act is a political act, then every act is the concern of the state, because the

157
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,860
political is the concern of the state.

158
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,020
If you've noticed that this is starting to sound like classical fascism, you'd be

159
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,660
correct. Mussolini's most famous quote, all within the state, nothing outside the

160
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,240
state, nothing against the state certainly applies here, but it runs deeper than that.

161
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,880
The fascist conception of the state is all embracing, outside of it no human or spiritual

162
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,500
values can exist, much less have value. This understood, fascism is totalitarian, and the

163
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:18,220
state, a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values, interprets, develops, and potentiates

164
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,580
the whole life of a people.

165
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,040
The people we're dealing with believe that the personal is political, that everything

166
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,620
is political and must be treated as such, that the private life is something to be scorned.

167
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,100
Just talk to any socialist about something like private ownership, and watch them reject

168
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,300
the liberal values of privacy and consent.

169
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,620
I'm sure at this point I don't need to quote Marx's rejection of liberal privacy

170
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,860
again. I've done it about five times now in different videos, you know the drill at

171
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,860
this point.

172
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,900
Mussolini mentioned synthesis in that quote for a specific reason. Giovanni Gentile, the

173
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,100
philosopher of fascism, was a neo-Hegelian, and in the Hegelian tradition, believed that

174
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,340
a fascist society would necessarily include a synthesis of public and private life, with

175
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,260
the socialist's publicness arising as the antithesis to the liberal's thesis of privateness.

176
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,340
The fascists viewed the distinction between public and private life as non-existent, imposed

177
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,100
by the liberal government, but not actually a real thing. This sounds a lot like the progressive

178
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,380
everything is political position, like the socialist everything must be turned towards

179
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,860
praxis position. What binds these philosophies together is that they are all totalitarian,

180
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,300
and I'm using that word properly to mean a political philosophy that concerns itself

181
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,500
with the total of everything. It is totalizing. There is nothing that exists that the philosophy

182
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,460
considers to be neutral, or unaligned, or outside of its scope. Fascism and socialism,

183
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,860
progressivism and Marxism, all view themselves as complete theories, and therefore there

184
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,100
is no topic in which they have no position. This is not the liberal point of view. For

185
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,860
the liberal, a lot of things are personal. For the liberal, a lot of things are private.

186
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,460
For the liberal, there is a whole section of life where the state's position should

187
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:47,700
be, do what you want, it's none of my business. A totalitarian philosophy can't tolerate

188
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,860
that appeal to privacy. It's a big part of why socialists don't understand consent,

189
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,540
because consent is fundamentally a private matter. If everything can be political, the

190
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,180
liberal position that allows for a private life is important to being able to actually

191
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:05,040
live as a human being. These same people who demand that everything be political, are paradoxically

192
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,800
ranting about the violence of speech, or the trauma of mental health issues, even as

193
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,400
their totalizing worldview causes a lot of that shit, or at least makes it a whole lot

194
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,760
worse. These same people who demand that the personal is political, are now shocked to

195
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,840
learn that politics has a profit motive, and rage at what they view as their personal getting

196
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,280
sold out because it's political now, and there's money to be made. These same people

197
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,960
who think that all media, all art, all video games, etc, are political, genuinely believe

198
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,120
that using political themes or engaging in political drama to tell a story, is the same

199
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,320
thing as shoehorning in their contemporary politics in order to push a particular stance

200
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,960
onto the audience, because the creator thinks that this property they've inherited would

201
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,120
make a great soapbox. These same people who talk about the value of the community, who

202
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,560
appeal to the community's greater needs and collective wisdom all the time, also paradoxically

203
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,040
consider the liberal position of, I can get along with people who have different opinions,

204
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,640
to be a personal attack against them, because for them, politics is a zero sum game. And

205
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,040
that brings us back around to the beginning, where no difference can be tolerated, where

206
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,880
the socialist struggle is so real, that if you side with red you're evil even if it's

207
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,480
blue who pushed you there. My good friend and podcast co-host, Lilith

208
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,840
Lovett, said it best, they don't want politics in games, they want preachy indoctrination

209
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,700
courses that confirm their pre-established worldview. A handjob from the author telling

210
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,740
them they're right and everybody else is wrong. They're upset that not every form

211
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,200
of media is propaganda for their cause. If your position is a totalitarian one, that's

212
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,900
how it has to be. Every quiet, peaceful moment is an opportunity to advance towards the utopia.

213
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:34,160
Every apolitical space is fertile soil to be seeded with ideology. Every liberal insistence

214
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,520
on the sanctity of the private life is an affront to their collective march towards

215
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,900
whatever they've arbitrarily deemed as progress. Sean, formerly of Sean and Jen fame back before

216
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:47,740
she took the Twitch channel, had this interesting conversation with Big Joel. Sean says, I've

217
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,740
interacted with a few right-wing internet personalities behind the scenes, asking me

218
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,420
to do debates, and it's always striking how polite and business-like they are. This

219
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,540
is not a compliment. Joel responds with, when Sargon wanted to talk to me he was so

220
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,500
polite and seemed vaguely affronted by my privately saying I don't respect him or

221
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,220
the work he does. Genuinely one of the more puzzling moments of my life. Because to these

222
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,800
people the personal is political, we can actually deduce a couple of things about them from

223
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,120
this short exchange. 1. They cannot conceive of the private, personal life. They don't

224
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,460
know why people would be polite to them on a personal level, but still disagree politically.

225
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,460
It's an alien concept to them. If every moment in every space must be filled with

226
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,460
praxis, and if you're talking to an evil reactionary counter-revolutionary alt-right

227
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:31,020
maga nazi chud, then even that private moment of discussion must be a place where your politics

228
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,580
shine through. Your totalitarian worldview demands it. This is why Sean thinks this is

229
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,660
not a compliment, that somebody would be polite to him if they happen to disagree. His politics

230
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,880
matters more than the private life. 2. If the personal is political, and they act this

231
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,780
toxically towards people on a personal level, what does that have to say about the toxicity

232
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:54,220
of their politics? If Sargon is kind to Joel personally, what does that say about his politics?

233
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:59,760
If Joel is cruel in return, what does that say about his? If every act truly is a theoretical

234
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,300
piece of political legislation, what does that say about the type of society that somebody

235
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,660
like Sean or Joel would implement if given the power? What type of person views their

236
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,460
interpersonal connections as expressions of politics? I hear a lot from leftoids about

237
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,060
how people who have been left behind by the left, people who have left the left because

238
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,500
leftists were mean to them, have no principles at all because if you truly cared about your

239
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,240
politics you wouldn't give them up for such shallow reasons as somebody was mean to me.

240
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,140
But if the personal is political, then what does this personal toxic treatment by leftists

241
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,820
say about the left's politics? A private life is something every human needs to have. A

242
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,660
place where you are not a political agent. A place where you can relax and enjoy your

243
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:40,080
friends or your family or your hobbies. A place where, regardless of the world raging

244
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,780
on the outside, you can retreat to and live quietly in peace. This is an essential component

245
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,640
of liberal political thought, that there is a time and place for politics and that

246
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,460
time is not all the time, that place is not every place. But the totalitarian worldview

247
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,700
of the left cannot abide by this. To them a private life is an attack on their ideology

248
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,020
because their ideology considers all places and all times as needing to be turned towards

249
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,380
them. If, in order to be a leftist, I must reject the liberal idea that there are times

250
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,940
and places in which politics are inappropriate, then I cannot be part of the left. I just

251
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,300
find it ironic that for as much as they cry out for safe spaces everywhere, a safe space

252
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:39,660
from politics is the one they reject.
