1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,340
Over on SFO Arcade, we just finished up Fourspoken, the latest PS5 exclusive.

2
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,140
So I guess it's finally time to talk about it.

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,200
And yes, it stinks.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,180
I wouldn't break out the indefensible intro and title if it didn't.

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,660
Let me give you the history.

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,380
Square Enix's early history is one of console exclusivity.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,520
Square games came out only on the NES and then the SNES.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,560
Then they famously jumped ship to Sony, choosing the PlayStation 1 over the Nintendo 64 due

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,780
to the latter opting to stick with cartridges that maxed out at 32 megs, while the former

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,260
utilized CDs with a storage capacity of 700 megs.

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,540
Back in the 90s, Square made the claim that Final Fantasy VII just wouldn't fit on a

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,540
cartridge.

13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,240
And as a kid of the 90s, let me tell you, this fueled a lot of schoolyard fights.

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,620
Square continued to be exclusive to Sony during the PlayStation 2, for the most part.

15
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,460
This strategy of Square Enix exclusivity worked because each of these console generations

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,580
had a clear winner.

17
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,640
The console that Square had backed was wildly more popular than the other options.

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,980
But with the seventh generation of consoles, that's the Wii, Xbox 360, and PS3 by the

19
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,620
way, all three of them were exceptionally popular.

20
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,340
And Square Enix realized that remaining loyal to Sony meant losing money.

21
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,580
So they developed a proprietary engine called Crystal Tools, meant to streamline the production

22
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,140
of their big upcoming title, Final Fantasy XIII, making it easy to run on multiple platforms.

23
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,980
The only problem is, it sucked.

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,780
Crystal Tools ended up being a huge Square Enix boondoggle, delaying the release of Final

25
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,820
Fantasy XIII by almost two years, while offering little to no value.

26
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,900
By 2011, the Crystal Tools engine had already been pushed to its breaking point during the

27
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,220
development of Final Fantasy XIII-2.

28
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,080
Cracks were showing, and Square Enix needed something else, if it was going to be able

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,580
to keep up on the PS4 and Xbox One.

30
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,380
You'd think, after the failure of Crystal Tools, Square would be smart enough to not

31
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,180
do this again, and maybe they'd use more conventional, more functional, more well-documented

32
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,180
developer tools.

33
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,860
Maybe license an engine, like Unreal or Unity or something.

34
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,580
But no, they made the exact same mistake.

35
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,740
To solve their Crystal Tools problem, Square Enix developed the Luminous engine in 2012,

36
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,860
and showed it off at the E3 of that year with the tech demo Agni's Philosophy.

37
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,820
Now if this looks familiar, that's because it should.

38
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,320
A lot of it ended up becoming forespoken ten years later, which is also why huge chunks

39
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,700
of forespoken look about ten years old.

40
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,620
The Luminous engine ended up having all the same problems that Crystal Tools did, becoming

41
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,560
another giant money pit for the company.

42
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,140
To date, only two games have used the Luminous engine, Final Fantasy XV in 2016, and forespoken

43
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,720
in 2023, eleven years later.

44
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,180
So a broken engine, decade-old art assets, last-ditch attempt to recoup monumental cost.

45
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,580
Forespoken's off to a great start, isn't it?

46
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,580
What else could go wrong?

47
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,140
Well, it was officially announced three years ago as Project Athia.

48
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,060
And when you go back and watch that old 2020 trailer, you can see a lot of the pieces that

49
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,260
would come together to later be forespoken.

50
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,520
These locations, that dragon, it's all in the game.

51
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,180
But this trailer was considered to be a huge joke.

52
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,380
Look closely, she's not wearing boots or some kind of era-appropriate footwear, she's

53
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,380
wearing kicks.

54
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,380
Air Jordans, baby!

55
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,700
That's when we all knew we were in for a fucking ride.

56
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,740
I'm going to spoil everything about forespoken because I don't care.

57
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,660
You shouldn't either, but if for some dumb reason you do, now's your chance to bail

58
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,660
out.

59
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,220
The plot of forespoken is the most bog-standard isekai plot I've ever seen.

60
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,260
Isekai is a Japanese word meaning different world, and it refers to a genre of storytelling

61
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,660
where a character from world A inexplicably finds themselves in world B and has to contend

62
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,660
with a sudden upheaval.

63
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,460
It's basically a fantastical version of the fish-out-of-water story, even though the

64
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,940
word isekai didn't really start to be used until the glut of 80s and 90s anime that used

65
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,940
the trope.

66
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,600
This type of story has existed for quite a while.

67
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,720
The quintessential Western isekai, for example, is Alice in Wonderland, and looking at Alice

68
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,060
gives us a basic idea of what the rules are.

69
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,340
One, the world that the protagonist originates from is generally the modern real world, at

70
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,740
the time the story was written.

71
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,580
In Alice, that's Victorian England, while in Vision of Escaflowne, for example, that's

72
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,620
90s Japan.

73
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,660
Rule two, what differentiates isekai from a normal travel epic like Lord of the Rings

74
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,700
or Journey to the West, is that the protagonist in an isekai doesn't go on a daunting yet

75
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,360
physically possible journey like crossing a continent.

76
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,500
The journey is seemingly an impossible one, making the quest to get back home nigh insurmountable.

77
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,140
In Alice, Wonderland is sometimes portrayed as an alternate dimension, and sometimes as

78
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,140
Alice's own psyche.

79
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,420
In Escaflowne, Gaia is an invisible, habitable planet caught in Earth's orbit.

80
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,660
In Digimon, the characters go into a physical representation of the internet.

81
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,160
In The Black Knight or A Kid in King Arthur's Court or Chrono Trigger, the characters are

82
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,580
flung through time with seemingly no way back.

83
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,260
In a countless number of isekai anime, especially pornographic ones, as well as those old cartoon

84
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,940
shows, where your average kid gets sucked into the TV like Captain N, the alternate

85
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,960
world operates like a video game.

86
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,680
Some people are tempted to call a movie like Avatar an isekai, since the trip to Pandora

87
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,880
is through deep space.

88
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,880
Maybe, maybe not, but I think it's not an isekai because of the third rule.

89
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,920
The protagonist has to be somewhat isolated, and must adapt to living in a totally alien

90
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,920
culture.

91
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,040
In Alice and Escaflowne, the characters are alone.

92
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,920
In Digimon, it's a small group of kids.

93
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,120
To contrast, in Avatar, a ton of humans have moved to Pandora and set up shop, recreating

94
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,460
Earth-like habitats.

95
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,480
Of course, people have played around with the genre.

96
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,380
Sometimes you'll see a reverse isekai, like Beastmaster 2 or Thor, where the protagonist

97
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,940
is from a fantasy world and crosses the dimensions that come to our world.

98
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,000
Sometimes the protagonist doesn't adopt the role of a prophesized hero in the other

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,940
world, and instead becomes a villain, like in My Next Life as a Villainess, or as a side

100
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,280
character, like in That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime.

101
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,140
But pretty much all isekai stories hit the same beats.

102
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,720
The protagonist's life in their original world is pretty shitty.

103
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,160
By random chance, the protagonist encounters a piece of the other world.

104
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,360
Maybe it's a person who crossed over, maybe it's an artifact, but whatever it is, it

105
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,480
inexplicably pulls them across the barrier.

106
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,360
Once on the other side, the protagonist is stuck with no way back.

107
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,160
New friends help the protagonist through the initial period of despair, and they begin

108
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,900
to right wrongs in their new home and grow as a person.

109
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,520
At the climax of the story, they finally have the opportunity to go home, and they take

110
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
it.

111
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,300
But once they're back, they realize they've changed too much.

112
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,240
They can't go back to how things used to be.

113
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,080
Their old life sucks, their new life is full of meaningful relationships, and now all they

114
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,360
want to do is go back to the other world again.

115
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,720
Eventually they do, generally just in time for the final confrontation with whatever

116
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,600
villain happens to be at the center of all the events happening in the other world.

117
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,560
A confrontation that our side heroes wouldn't be able to overcome without the protagonist's

118
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
return.

119
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,360
It's also revealed at some point that the reason all of this happened in the first place

120
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,760
is because the protagonist, despite having an outwardly mundane life, has had some connection

121
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,440
to the other world this whole time.

122
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,480
Generally because one of their parents has traveled across the barrier in their youth

123
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,600
and secretly settled in our world.

124
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,020
Isekai stories are so old hat that any modern attempt either plays with the formula to make

125
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,300
something new or sarcastically leans into the genre, parodying the whole thing and breaking

126
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,300
the fourth wall constantly.

127
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,300
Forespoken does neither of those things.

128
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,700
In fact, Forespoken is the most by-the-books Isekai story I've ever seen.

129
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,880
It feels like an AI-generated script.

130
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,580
It follows every single convention of the genre.

131
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,160
Frey lives a shit life as a poor black woman on the run from both the law and gangs in

132
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
New York City.

133
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,820
She breaks into a building to steal what looks to be a very expensive gold brace.

134
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,900
The brace sucks her into the fantasy world of Athia, from Project Athia, remember, where

135
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,420
she is a mage specializing in Earth magic.

136
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,220
The land is covered in a consuming blight that corrupts all life and turns them into

137
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,660
zombies, and the townsfolk desperately need a hero.

138
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:14,020
The first three-quarters of the game consists of very generic open-world wandering and fetch-questing

139
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,540
with little in the way of actual plot, until Frey wakes up one day and finds herself back

140
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,380
in New York, this time living a much more comfortable life.

141
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,380
This is the one real deviation from the Isekai convention.

142
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,060
Frey's trip back to her old life ends up being an illusion created by another mage,

143
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,220
which doesn't actually go back, but it serves the same emotional purpose.

144
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,200
After this sequence, the final couple hours of the game is literally just cutscenes.

145
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,380
They seriously dump all of the lore and the story on the player in the final stretch,

146
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,880
expecting us to care when it's actually just really boring.

147
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,500
And the lore that they dump is something that we all predicted within the first hour of

148
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
the game.

149
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,940
The blight corrupted the other three mages, called Tantas, powerful wise women who wield

150
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,260
fire, water, and wind magic to complement Frey's Earth magic.

151
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,200
Frey is the daughter of the original Earth Tanta, who in a fit of madness throws her

152
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,220
baby into the portal to New York.

153
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,580
No seriously, she just yeets that fucking kid.

154
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,940
And all of the tomfoolery is caused by her talking gold brace, yeah it talks by the way,

155
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,780
who turns out to be an ancient evil sealed by the Tantas.

156
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,620
This guy, Cuff, is one of the more annoying parts of the game.

157
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,660
He serves as the game's guide, like Navi in Ocarina of Time or Fi in Skyward Sword.

158
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,940
But Cuff is more annoying than any of them, and unlike in the Zelda games, he's not bouncing

159
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,980
off a silent protagonist, he's paired with Frey who is just as fucking annoying.

160
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,060
These two together, they're a dialogue written by millennials who don't know how to take

161
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,260
anything seriously whatsoever and have to insert Marvel-style jokes and quips every

162
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:48,580
second, make for the cringiest moments in the entire game.

163
00:08:48,580 --> 00:09:16,700
But, to the

164
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,340
game's credit, it's very rare that the tutorial helper becomes the main villain.

165
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,940
Using the Zelda examples again, Navi is just a random fairy, Fi is your sword come to life,

166
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,540
Midna is an important character in her own right but not the villain, and Hel in spirit

167
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:33,180
tracks, the helper is the spirit of Princess Zelda, serving as both romantic interest and

168
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,180
a ghost.

169
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,180
But a villain?

170
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,620
I can't say I've seen that before, I don't think.

171
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,820
Anyway, that's the whole story.

172
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,020
The entire thing is predictable the minute you realize you're playing an isekai.

173
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,660
It brings nothing new to the table, and nearly everything old that it did, it did very poorly.

174
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,620
But hey, there's more to a game than the story, right?

175
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,980
What about the rest of it?

176
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,220
Well, the game itself looks pretty hideous.

177
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,520
The open world can be pretty sometimes, at least from a breathtaking Vista perspective,

178
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,340
but the actual world itself seems barren, and I don't mean because the blight has depopulated

179
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,340
the land.

180
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,020
It seems unfinished, and sometimes it literally just is unfinished.

181
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,260
The enemies that you fight, from zombies to animals to humans, are all generic but work

182
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,260
well enough.

183
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,140
The characters you meet, though, good god.

184
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,020
You can tell development on this game started in 2012, because it certainly looks like it.

185
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,700
Sometimes, For Spoken looks like it's a PS3 title, not a PS5 one, and the cutscenes

186
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,560
also just look unfinished.

187
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,500
Check this clip out of Frey breaking down a door with her magic.

188
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,180
Not a single muscle twitches on her face, as she blasts the door away, which by the

189
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,400
way, we won't even get to see because the camera cuts away last minute.

190
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,140
Gotta save development time somehow, just don't animate that break-in scene guys,

191
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,480
no one will notice, it'll be okay.

192
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,940
As for what's actually in the open world itself, there's not much.

193
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,060
You can find collectibles, like the same five herbs for potions arranged in the exact same

194
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,540
pattern, like they just copy-paste with a cluster of them, or the same groups of zombies

195
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,700
and wolves.

196
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,540
Sometimes you'll find a dungeon, which is a short set of duplicated hallways with a

197
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,540
boss at the end.

198
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,740
And these can be kind of fun, if only because you're about to get some pretty good loot.

199
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,460
Sometimes you'll find a spring where new spells can be unlocked, but these are few

200
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,460
and far between.

201
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,420
For the most part, there's just nothing to do in the open world.

202
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,020
Despite the low quality of the visuals, this is a demanding game on PC.

203
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,340
The recommended Steam specs are ridiculously high for what you're getting.

204
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,680
Also, the game is 150 gigs dude, what the absolute fuck.

205
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,240
The world's big, but it's not bigger than Skyrim, or Hyrule in Breath of the Wild, or

206
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,800
the Commonwealth in Fallout 4.

207
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,120
The only good part about the graphics are the spell effects, which do legitimately look

208
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,120
magical.

209
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,140
The flaming spear, the orb of water, the glitter that splashes off Frey's shoes when she

210
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,520
runs around with magic speed, it all fits really well.

211
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,520
And considering that the luminous engine was made specifically for those types of effects,

212
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,680
it's no surprise that that's what stands out.

213
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,340
The magic is, in fact, one of the only true positives of the game.

214
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,400
The equipment system allows you to put on different cloaks and necklaces, the only two

215
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,640
equip slots, and you can upgrade them with random bits and bobs you find in the open

216
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,760
world, which is the same as most RPGs.

217
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,640
You can do your nails by putting different runes in them as well.

218
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,220
But all of these systems serve to buff your magic.

219
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,680
The magic is what takes center stage, and it's pretty fun.

220
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,560
It's satisfying to use the wide array of spells at your disposal.

221
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,600
It's cool when you take out one of the tantas and learn their elemental magic, and each

222
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,160
of the four elements has their own skill tree that you plug experience points into in order

223
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,520
to unlock new spells and buff existing ones.

224
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,300
And man, there are so many legitimately fun spells.

225
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,720
You can throw rocks in a rapid succession or charge up for one big blast.

226
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,460
You can swing a flame sword around or toss flame spears that explode on impact.

227
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,860
You can encase enemies in a giant ball of water or fire a horizontal spread of ice shards.

228
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,300
You can throw electric darts or charge up a huge lightning storm.

229
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,300
And more!

230
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,020
There's dozens of spells, all with their own unique effects and feel, and the trailer

231
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,540
to the game has no problem emphasizing the variety.

232
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,580
The issue is, you only unlock the other schools of magic by defeating the tantas, and defeating

233
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,200
the tantas is the whole point of the game.

234
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,820
You spend a huge chunk of the early game with earth magic, unlock fire magic halfway through,

235
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,100
and you really only get a smidge of time with water and wind.

236
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,060
In fact, once you kill the final tanta and unlock the wind magic, that's when the final

237
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,900
two hours of exposition dump begins.

238
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,900
There's no enemies, no challenges, no opportunities to use any of your cool new wind magic.

239
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,580
There's long boring cutscenes telling you stuff you figured out hours ago if you're

240
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,660
smart, punctuated by empty rooms that contain nothing but experience pickups you have to

241
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,540
run around and collect, and an NPC who triggers the next cutscene.

242
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm not fucking kidding, dude.

243
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,500
It feels like they knew they just gave you a new skill tree in the final hour of the

244
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,380
game, and said oh shit this is useless unless we just dump a bunch of exp on you so you

245
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,380
can level it up.

246
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,540
In a well designed game, you unlock your core abilities relatively early on, so that the

247
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,600
game has the opportunity to develop their use.

248
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,180
In Zelda Breath of the Wild, you get bombs, magnets, time stop, and ice freeze all in

249
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,260
the opening area of the game, because the entire game is all about using these tools

250
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,600
to solve puzzles.

251
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,620
Even in more linear Zeldas, the most useful tools show up in the early to mid game.

252
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,460
This is elementary stuff in game design.

253
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,740
You can even go back to Secret of Mana on the Super Nintendo, where you unlock every

254
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,220
single magic school with the exception of I think nature magic in the first half of

255
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,580
the game, or Luffyya 2, where the bombs, arrow, and hookshot are all obtained in dungeons

256
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,700
pretty early on.

257
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,300
Any competent game knows to give you the bulk of your kit by the halfway point, so that

258
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,960
you can actually get good at using it, and save only the advanced stuff for later on,

259
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,420
like Knights of the Round in Final Fantasy 7, or the alien weapons in Fallout.

260
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,340
But in Forspoken, you're filling out a completely new skill tree that you'll never actually

261
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,820
use in the final hour.

262
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,440
The other interesting part of the game is movement.

263
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,660
Each school of magic comes with a different movement ability.

264
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,520
You start with magic running and magic parkour, which is the reason that Frey keeps her Air

265
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,900
Jordans from the other world.

266
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,380
In New York, she was a parkour artist.

267
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,380
A parkourist?

268
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,380
Whatever.

269
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,540
Once you gain fire magic, you unlock a grappling hook that feels a lot like the ODM gear from

270
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,540
Attack on Titan, and chaining parkour flips with grapples is legitimately really fun.

271
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,340
With water magic, you unlock surfing, which I had to find a clip of online, because there's

272
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,260
never a reason to ever enter a body of water in this game, where surfing would be required.

273
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,260
And with wind magic, you unlock a quadruple jump, which isn't really that interesting,

274
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,600
because you have to stay in place and charge it in order to do it, breaking the whole flow

275
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,220
feeling of getting around the game.

276
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,600
There is a glider in the game, the float spell, which in my opinion is an open world must-have

277
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,500
ever since Breath of the Wild did it in 2016, but you can only unlock it near the end of

278
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,600
the game, and for some reason it's a water spell, not a wind spell.

279
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,940
In other games that have included gliders, like Zelda or Horizon Forbidden West, you

280
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,920
pick them up early on because game developers realized just how much they aided exploration

281
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,240
and open world environment.

282
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,780
Letting you drift to a location you can see on the horizon from a tall area is actually

283
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,780
really cool.

284
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,040
Putting the float spell at the very end of the game, long after you'd ever need it,

285
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,400
just doesn't make any sense.

286
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,420
You can tell that I'm an old man at this point, considering how many old games and

287
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,280
shows I'm referencing that did parts of what Forsaken tried to do, but better.

288
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,040
Here, I'll put a bowtie on the whole thing.

289
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,920
Forsaken reminds me of Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.

290
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,320
For you zoomers who don't know what that is, here's the TLDR.

291
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,880
In the early 90s, Japanese game developers thought that Americans were too dumb to understand

292
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,880
RPGs.

293
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,760
RPGs were the most popular genre in Japan, but platformers ruled the day in America,

294
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,080
and Square was worried about spending tons of time translating Final Fantasy games only

295
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,440
for them to have a poor reception.

296
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,280
So they had an American development team create what is now derisively known as Baby's

297
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,680
First RPG.

298
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,960
Final Fantasy Mystic Quest has all the mechanics and feeling of a mainline Final Fantasy game

299
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,400
on the Super Nintendo, but with everything drastically dumbed down to make it more accessible.

300
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,680
Now it's still a pretty good game, great music specifically, but oh boy is it easy.

301
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,560
Mystic Quest features easy-to-dodge enemies instead of random encounters.

302
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,560
New armor overwrites old armor instead of actually being equippable.

303
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,080
There's only four weapons in the whole game that you upgrade a couple times.

304
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,160
Items and spells are identical, like a potion and the cure spell do the exact same thing.

305
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,880
The story is laughably simplistic, but at the end of the day, Babydev had a good time

306
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
with it.

307
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,080
Playing for Spoken feels like playing Mystic Quest.

308
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,280
Yeah, you can go into dungeons, but they're basically the same thing with similar loot

309
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
every time.

310
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,920
Yeah, you can equip necklaces and cloaks, but they don't really offer much in the

311
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,920
way of upgrades beyond just flat bonuses to magic, or sometimes a specific element.

312
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,440
And upgrading them is just a linear progression.

313
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,120
There's no super amazing loot to find that radically changes the game somehow.

314
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,800
Putting runes on your nails is the same thing.

315
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,480
You slap on the 5% damage nails and then wait until you find the 10% damage nails.

316
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
Rinse and repeat.

317
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,080
The same herbs craft the same one potion you use all game, and you find them in every single

318
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
zone.

319
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,740
If Mystic Quest was Babby's first JRPG, for Spoken is Babby's first open world game.

320
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,740
Everything in it is a dumbed down version of something from a better game.

321
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,480
And if for Spoken was only Babys first open world game, there wouldn't be anything wrong

322
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,480
with that.

323
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,240
If the only issue with the game was simplicity, it would be a perfect game to hand to a kid,

324
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,040
or a new gamer or something who wanted to get into it, as a gateway into something more

325
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,240
complicated like Fallout or Skyrim.

326
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,040
In this context, we can even forgive the paint by numbers storyline.

327
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,160
If it's literally your first isekai because you're 6 years old, I'm sure it'll feel

328
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,280
magical to you.

329
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,920
Though then again, who lets their 6 year old play a game that drops the f-bomb every 30

330
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
seconds?

331
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,000
But it's not only the simplicity, it's the genuinely awful pacing of the game in

332
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,560
terms of both plot and mechanics.

333
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,160
It's the emptiness of the world.

334
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
The ugliness of it.

335
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,320
It's how the game feels fun for a little bit, until you realize you've just spent

336
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,560
hours doing nothing because there's nothing in the game to do, and what little there is

337
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,880
is mediocre at best.

338
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,720
So it's no surprise that this game got absolutely bombarded by fans online.

339
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,680
The Steam page for Spoken looks like the aftermath of a gangbang, and even though there's reports

340
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,820
of the developers deleting reviews, it doesn't actually matter that much because the reviews

341
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,840
are overwhelmingly negative, too many for them to handle.

342
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,940
The Metacritic score doesn't look all that great either, and the game's already seeing

343
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,080
some price drops.

344
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,120
Square Enix went through all this hassle over the Luminous Engine, only to make two games

345
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,080
with it.

346
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,360
Final Fantasy XV might have been a success, but For Spoken, which came at the end of the

347
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,600
engine's life, seems to be a total flop on multiple dimensions.

348
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,840
We're this deep into the video, and I haven't even addressed the elephant in the room.

349
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,520
Frey, the main character of For Spoken, is black.

350
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
Dun dun dun.

351
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,200
Now I personally don't care what race the characters in any game are.

352
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
It shouldn't be an issue.

353
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,800
And there are a few idiots out there who are just straight up saying, the main character

354
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
in the game is black, no thanks.

355
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,600
And it's like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

356
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,400
No, the problem with Frey isn't that she's black.

357
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,600
It's that she's black.

358
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,040
Capital B Black.

359
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,040
Political Black.

360
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,240
You notice that, suddenly a whole bunch of things come into focus, like the way she speaks

361
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,500
when engaging with the fantasy world of Athia, or how insistent she is on keeping her Air

362
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:31,240
Jordans so that she can parkour around the wilderness, or how doing her nails up in garish

363
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,040
patterns is a core mechanic, or how back in New York she lives in a crack shack but still

364
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,540
displays proudly her expensive collection of kicks on a shelf in a central location.

365
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,540
For Spoken clearly wants to be like a BLM game.

366
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,320
It opens on Frey in court with a rap sheet filled with thefts.

367
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,760
She gets a lenient sentence from the judge who takes pity on her, and then she immediately

368
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,160
goes out into the streets and gets jumped by a gang that she owes money to or something.

369
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,200
I don't know, and it doesn't matter, because I never actually see these characters again anyway.

370
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,120
Frey manages to parkour away to safety, but the whole thing stinks of social commentary

371
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,720
regarding the black inner-city experience or something.

372
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,440
I already don't buy this setup, because this girl is 21, beautiful, and living in 2023.

373
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,440
She's got a phone.

374
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,480
There's no way she wouldn't start selling OnlyFans, make a bank, and get the fuck out of here.

375
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,200
And this discrepancy is made more clear by the fact that they cast one of the hottest

376
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,160
chicks around right now to play her.

377
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,940
After admiring that shoe collection, she falls asleep back at the crack shack, only to wake

378
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,760
up to the whole place on fire.

379
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,360
It's pretty clear that the gang lit her apartment up as revenge, and this is when probably the

380
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,000
dumbest sequence in the whole game happens.

381
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The Homer!

382
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Girl, come on, we gotta go!

383
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Gotta find Homer first.

384
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Gotta find Homer first.

385
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Gotta find Homer first.

386
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,680
That's right, even though the duffel bag full of her life savings, in cash, is right at

387
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,420
her feet, the money she's been scrimping together to be able to move the fuck out of New York

388
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:57,580
for years, the game forces you to leave the money behind to go and find your pet cat.

389
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,380
After which, of course, you lose the money.

390
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,880
There's no reason for this.

391
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,160
It's just right fucking there, dude, just pick it up and go!

392
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,160
Frey survives the fire, though, and in desperation looks through the window of a building, sees

393
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,120
Cuff, and decides to steal him to make some money, kicking off the adventure.

394
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,400
And it's at this point that, beyond Frey's terrible personality, the political content

395
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,880
of the game vanishes.

396
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,480
They clearly tried to go for some sort of message, but it disappears from the game entirely.

397
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,400
It doesn't even come back when she goes into the dreamscape, thinking she's back in her

398
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
old life again.

399
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,240
In fact, in that multi-hour cutscene where the entire plot is dumped at the end, it's

400
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,880
revealed that while her mother is a Tanta from Athia, her father is a random black dude

401
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,240
from New York named Al.

402
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,520
I personally like to think it's Al Roker.

403
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,640
But where is the guy?

404
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,320
Frey's mother clearly knows him before she gets pregnant, and she didn't get magically

405
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,000
transformed into a dragon until after she gave birth and yeeted Frey through the portal.

406
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,720
Oh yeah, Frey's mother got transformed into a dragon, but it's not important.

407
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,760
The point is, where is Frey's dad?

408
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,000
He's not keeping up with the love of his life?

409
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,280
The woman that he knocked up from the other fucking dimension?

410
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,880
Nah, nobody hears from him again.

411
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,720
He's literally the stereotype of the black absentee father.

412
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,280
They're really going all out with the representation, eh?

413
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,780
However, even with the reveal of Frey's parentage, the political aspect of the game

414
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,040
never returns.

415
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,440
Frey settles into her new life as the protector of the blissfully deracialized world of Athia,

416
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,640
and abandons our world and its problems entirely.

417
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,960
Here's the real kicker though.

418
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
The game's awful.

419
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
Like, I'd give it a 4 out of 10.

420
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,780
But because it has this wallpaper of black politics.

421
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,800
Because if you only played the first hour of the game, you might think it's highly

422
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
politically charged.

423
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,920
There's a lot of retarded progressives online right now who think that if you hate the game,

424
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,480
it has to be because you're a racist.

425
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
Can't be any other reason.

426
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,120
Can't be that the game is poorly designed, or ugly, or buggy, or not all that fun to

427
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
play.

428
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,720
Because you're a fucking white male.

429
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,720
Even if you're not.

430
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,720
Is the game good?

431
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
Yes, the game is good.

432
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,600
Fuck social media, get you the game, is what I'm about to be saying.

433
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,960
That's gonna be the title.

434
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,360
Fuck social media, buy the game, okay?

435
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,360
Because people tripping.

436
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,400
No, I promise you, if you're playing the game, you're not gonna sit here and be like,

437
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,600
oh my god, the dialogue, oh my god, it's so bad, I can't play the game!

438
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,480
Because every three seconds, I see someone on social talking about, they see one clip

439
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,520
and it's like, that's the whole game.

440
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,520
Come on, bro.

441
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,520
Damn it, you just stepped on my throat.

442
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,320
I just kicked a whole deer, bro.

443
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,200
Y'all didn't even see that, for real.

444
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,520
If you haven't actually seen anything other than the one clip from a scene that wasn't

445
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,960
even that cringey, I don't wanna hear about the dialogue.

446
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,000
Like I said, if she looked like any other, anything else, if she looked like anything

447
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,400
else and she said the same scene, no one would bat an eye.

448
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
It would be like, what the hell?

449
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,720
It would just be bad writing.

450
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,520
Like, it's not the best writing, but it's not a bad game.

451
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,280
That's what I'm trying to say.

452
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,360
It's not a bad game.

453
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,760
It's like the basic writing.

454
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
It could be better.

455
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,120
They probably could have gotten black writers, but they didn't.

456
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
That's unfortunate.

457
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,640
But the game's not ass.

458
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,840
Gear and how you heal up and the crafting isn't too much because I hate crafting in

459
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,160
the games and the crafting's not overbearing.

460
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,680
You get like, you can change these nails that give you different powers.

461
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Like, I don't know.

462
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,800
I just, I'm fucking with the game.

463
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
It's a good game.

464
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,000
The story is not even horrible.

465
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,240
The story is a story, but I ain't like, damn, this plot is ass.

466
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,120
I'm following it and I don't follow stories that well.

467
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,360
I'm here.

468
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,540
And of course, Prague game developers are out here saying the exact same thing.

469
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:23,800
Do I think that some of the energy and vitriol and just discussion about this game is happening

470
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:33,000
because some, but cause it is a lead female black character and it is on a PlayStation

471
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,960
game versus an Xbox game.

472
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,440
Yes, I do.

473
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
And then people push back.

474
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,800
Well, I haven't seen anything written like that.

475
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
Really?

476
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,040
You can't read between the lines.

477
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:47,680
So do you ever actually see somebody when they're shitting on game pass go, I don't

478
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,400
really have an issue with game pass.

479
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,480
I just like PlayStation and want Microsoft to lose.

480
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,840
Or when someone's being a misogynist, do they own being a misogynist and say, well, here's

481
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,760
the real fucking deal.

482
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,840
The real fucking deal is a women scare me.

483
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,920
I don't really like them.

484
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,300
I don't trust them and they don't want to fuck me.

485
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,800
That's why I'm really upset about this game.

486
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,540
No one talks like that.

487
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,540
It's called subtext.

488
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:15,720
So of course you're not seeing people overtly saying I'm not playing for spoken or I'm shitting

489
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,720
on for spoken or I am giving an unjust given the success of what it looks like the game

490
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,280
is going to have amount of time and energy on the internet and in my writing to first

491
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,360
spoken because I'm a racist, they're not going to say that.

492
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,160
Oh, and Bakaki wants you to know if you don't stream for spoken tonight, you're a racist

493
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
and a misogynist.

494
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,320
Oh, of course.

495
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
Of course.

496
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,440
If you read sarcasm from that clip, I promise you he was being serious.

497
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,060
That's David Scott Jeff.

498
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,280
Of course, the polygon review of the game has to dive into this topic as well.

499
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,020
And outwardly, they appear to have the same take that I do.

500
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:51,500
Before I wrap up, let's spare a word for Frey, a notionally black protagonist who joins

501
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:56,040
a growing trend in media of putting black people in worlds where race is inconsequential.

502
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,340
Except the game is very insistent that Frey is a New Yorker, mysterious birth or not,

503
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:04,240
spending her entire life up until this point growing up in our decidedly non fantasy world

504
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,500
where blackness is not a non factor.

505
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,540
Regrettably, Frey's identity is thinly written and awkwardly deployed as the story leans

506
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,160
not only on stereotypical narratives, but trauma as a plot device.

507
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,200
The complaint here is that the political blackness of the game isn't given enough focus.

508
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,600
Polygon felt bait and switch by that first hour and wanted it everywhere in the game.

509
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
I feel the opposite way.

510
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
I wanted none of it in the game.

511
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,800
But if they were going to do it, immediately dispensing with it unceremoniously after making

512
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,200
it to Athia is probably the worst way to do it.

513
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,040
It feels like they're cowardly or something.

514
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,200
What they could have done if they really wanted to make a racialized story correctly is have

515
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,520
a different group in Athia, maybe not black Athians, that's two on the nose, make them

516
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,480
a cast or a fantasy race or green people or something who are treated poorly due to their

517
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
birth.

518
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,680
And Frey, with her outsider knowledge of race relations on Earth, can shed some light on

519
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,320
the problem from a perspective that Athians never considered.

520
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,420
You could actually make a good story out of that if you tried.

521
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,920
The problem here is no one tried.

522
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,380
Before I get out of here, there's one final thing to talk about.

523
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,380
Hi-Fi Rush.

524
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,900
Hi-Fi Rush is a Bethesda game that looks and plays amazing.

525
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,040
Everything about it, the cel-shaded graphics, the rhythm based combat, the soundtrack, all

526
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,680
scream 2000s to me, which of course I'm a sucker for considering that was the time

527
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,600
period of my high school experience.

528
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,920
People online are comparing Hi-Fi Rush's dialogue to first spoken and fair enough,

529
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,940
and both swamped in millennial writing, jokes during serious moments, fourth wall breaking

530
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,940
stuff, all of it.

531
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,540
But the difference is, forespoken is trying to be a serious fantasy adventure, while simultaneously

532
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:26,660
being embarrassed of itself, while Hi-Fi Rush is a jokey Saturday morning cartoon that knows

533
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,800
it is a cartoon.

534
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,040
The game is in on the joke and it's endearing, and it also knows not to go too overboard

535
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
with it as well.

536
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,200
There's a balance here, Hi-Fi Rush strikes it, forespoken does not.

537
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,560
Hi-Fi Rush and forespoken are being compared on the internet right now because they're

538
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,440
polar opposites occupying the same space, and it's not just because they both feature

539
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
millennial writing.

540
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,340
They're the only two notable games to come out during January of 2023.

541
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,000
Forespoken has a build up of multiple years of the Square Enix hype machine behind it,

542
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,180
while Hi-Fi Rush was released the same day it was announced, during a recent Xbox Bethesda

543
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,020
developer conference, with no hype behind it at all.

544
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,120
Forespoken is an open world game, a bland empty sandbox with nothing to do and nobody

545
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,400
interesting in it, while Hi-Fi Rush is a level based hack and slash where each of the environments

546
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,960
and characters appear to be lovingly crafted.

547
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,340
Forespoken launched at 70 US dollars, Sony paid a boatload of money to make it a two

548
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:18,440
year PS5 console exclusive, and the PC version barely functions unless you've got an amazing

549
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,520
graphics card, while Hi-Fi Rush launched for 30 dollars on Xbox and PC.

550
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,480
You can play it on your shitty 10 year old computer, and you can even play it on Gamepass.

551
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,200
It's no surprise that Hi-Fi Rush basically blew forespoken out of the water in terms

552
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,520
of popularity, is it?

553
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,720
The progs on Twitter are screeching that gamers are all just racist because the cringe writing

554
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,060
in forespoken is identical to Hi-Fi Rush's, but what they don't seem to understand is

555
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,680
that context matters.

556
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,440
Also making a good fucking game matters too.

557
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,080
By the time this video comes out, I have a feeling that the forespoken discourse will

558
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,040
have already been fully washed away by Hi-Fi Rush's success.

559
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,020
I started this script on February 2nd.

560
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:55,980
The game is so indefensible generic, and people are so tired of being browbeat, that the cries

561
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,840
of racist sexist gamers aren't going to do anything this time.

562
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,920
The game sucks, and that's too bad because there's an okay skeleton in here.

563
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,660
The combat, the movement, and even the skill trees are interesting.

564
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,700
They just needed a totally different game packaged around it.

565
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,920
Which is funny, because Agni's philosophy did in fact look like a totally different

566
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
game.

567
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,760
Same art style, same engine, same mechanics, same assets, but totally different characters.

568
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,360
Forespoken really just feels like Square Enix desperately needed to recoup a lot of money.

569
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,800
They had bits and bobs of their games lying around, and they decided to mash it all together

570
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,060
and race swap the protagonist to make her black because Black Lives Matter sells.

571
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,860
Well, it didn't sell enough.

572
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,500
If you're going to get this one, wait for a deep discount, guys.

573
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,960
I'm talking like five to ten dollars.

574
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,000
This one is not fucking worth it.
