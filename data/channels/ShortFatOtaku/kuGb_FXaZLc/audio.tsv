0	17340	Over on SFO Arcade, we just finished up Fourspoken, the latest PS5 exclusive.
17340	19140	So I guess it's finally time to talk about it.
19140	20200	And yes, it stinks.
20200	23180	I wouldn't break out the indefensible intro and title if it didn't.
23180	24660	Let me give you the history.
24660	28380	Square Enix's early history is one of console exclusivity.
28380	31520	Square games came out only on the NES and then the SNES.
31520	36560	Then they famously jumped ship to Sony, choosing the PlayStation 1 over the Nintendo 64 due
36560	40780	to the latter opting to stick with cartridges that maxed out at 32 megs, while the former
40780	44260	utilized CDs with a storage capacity of 700 megs.
44260	48540	Back in the 90s, Square made the claim that Final Fantasy VII just wouldn't fit on a
48540	49540	cartridge.
49540	53240	And as a kid of the 90s, let me tell you, this fueled a lot of schoolyard fights.
53240	57620	Square continued to be exclusive to Sony during the PlayStation 2, for the most part.
57620	62460	This strategy of Square Enix exclusivity worked because each of these console generations
62460	63580	had a clear winner.
63580	67640	The console that Square had backed was wildly more popular than the other options.
67640	71980	But with the seventh generation of consoles, that's the Wii, Xbox 360, and PS3 by the
71980	74620	way, all three of them were exceptionally popular.
74620	78340	And Square Enix realized that remaining loyal to Sony meant losing money.
78340	82580	So they developed a proprietary engine called Crystal Tools, meant to streamline the production
82580	87140	of their big upcoming title, Final Fantasy XIII, making it easy to run on multiple platforms.
87180	88980	The only problem is, it sucked.
88980	92780	Crystal Tools ended up being a huge Square Enix boondoggle, delaying the release of Final
92780	96820	Fantasy XIII by almost two years, while offering little to no value.
96820	100900	By 2011, the Crystal Tools engine had already been pushed to its breaking point during the
100900	103220	development of Final Fantasy XIII-2.
103220	106080	Cracks were showing, and Square Enix needed something else, if it was going to be able
106080	108580	to keep up on the PS4 and Xbox One.
108580	112380	You'd think, after the failure of Crystal Tools, Square would be smart enough to not
112380	117180	do this again, and maybe they'd use more conventional, more functional, more well-documented
117180	118180	developer tools.
118180	120860	Maybe license an engine, like Unreal or Unity or something.
120860	122580	But no, they made the exact same mistake.
122580	126740	To solve their Crystal Tools problem, Square Enix developed the Luminous engine in 2012,
126740	130860	and showed it off at the E3 of that year with the tech demo Agni's Philosophy.
130860	132820	Now if this looks familiar, that's because it should.
132820	137320	A lot of it ended up becoming forespoken ten years later, which is also why huge chunks
137320	139700	of forespoken look about ten years old.
139700	143620	The Luminous engine ended up having all the same problems that Crystal Tools did, becoming
143620	145560	another giant money pit for the company.
145560	151140	To date, only two games have used the Luminous engine, Final Fantasy XV in 2016, and forespoken
151140	153720	in 2023, eleven years later.
153720	159180	So a broken engine, decade-old art assets, last-ditch attempt to recoup monumental cost.
159180	160580	Forespoken's off to a great start, isn't it?
160580	161580	What else could go wrong?
161580	165140	Well, it was officially announced three years ago as Project Athia.
165140	169060	And when you go back and watch that old 2020 trailer, you can see a lot of the pieces that
169060	171260	would come together to later be forespoken.
171260	173520	These locations, that dragon, it's all in the game.
173520	176180	But this trailer was considered to be a huge joke.
176180	180380	Look closely, she's not wearing boots or some kind of era-appropriate footwear, she's
180380	181380	wearing kicks.
181380	182380	Air Jordans, baby!
182380	184700	That's when we all knew we were in for a fucking ride.
184700	187740	I'm going to spoil everything about forespoken because I don't care.
187740	190660	You shouldn't either, but if for some dumb reason you do, now's your chance to bail
190660	191660	out.
191660	195220	The plot of forespoken is the most bog-standard isekai plot I've ever seen.
195220	199260	Isekai is a Japanese word meaning different world, and it refers to a genre of storytelling
199260	203660	where a character from world A inexplicably finds themselves in world B and has to contend
203660	204660	with a sudden upheaval.
204660	208460	It's basically a fantastical version of the fish-out-of-water story, even though the
208460	212940	word isekai didn't really start to be used until the glut of 80s and 90s anime that used
212940	213940	the trope.
213940	215600	This type of story has existed for quite a while.
215600	219720	The quintessential Western isekai, for example, is Alice in Wonderland, and looking at Alice
219720	222060	gives us a basic idea of what the rules are.
222060	226340	One, the world that the protagonist originates from is generally the modern real world, at
226340	227740	the time the story was written.
227740	231580	In Alice, that's Victorian England, while in Vision of Escaflowne, for example, that's
231580	232620	90s Japan.
232620	236660	Rule two, what differentiates isekai from a normal travel epic like Lord of the Rings
236660	240700	or Journey to the West, is that the protagonist in an isekai doesn't go on a daunting yet
240700	243360	physically possible journey like crossing a continent.
243360	248500	The journey is seemingly an impossible one, making the quest to get back home nigh insurmountable.
248500	252140	In Alice, Wonderland is sometimes portrayed as an alternate dimension, and sometimes as
252140	253140	Alice's own psyche.
253140	257420	In Escaflowne, Gaia is an invisible, habitable planet caught in Earth's orbit.
257420	260660	In Digimon, the characters go into a physical representation of the internet.
260660	264160	In The Black Knight or A Kid in King Arthur's Court or Chrono Trigger, the characters are
264160	266580	flung through time with seemingly no way back.
266580	271260	In a countless number of isekai anime, especially pornographic ones, as well as those old cartoon
271260	274940	shows, where your average kid gets sucked into the TV like Captain N, the alternate
274940	276960	world operates like a video game.
277760	281680	Some people are tempted to call a movie like Avatar an isekai, since the trip to Pandora
281680	282880	is through deep space.
282880	286880	Maybe, maybe not, but I think it's not an isekai because of the third rule.
286880	290920	The protagonist has to be somewhat isolated, and must adapt to living in a totally alien
290920	291920	culture.
291920	294040	In Alice and Escaflowne, the characters are alone.
294040	295920	In Digimon, it's a small group of kids.
295920	300120	To contrast, in Avatar, a ton of humans have moved to Pandora and set up shop, recreating
300120	301460	Earth-like habitats.
301460	303480	Of course, people have played around with the genre.
303480	307380	Sometimes you'll see a reverse isekai, like Beastmaster 2 or Thor, where the protagonist
307380	310940	is from a fantasy world and crosses the dimensions that come to our world.
310940	314000	Sometimes the protagonist doesn't adopt the role of a prophesized hero in the other
314000	318940	world, and instead becomes a villain, like in My Next Life as a Villainess, or as a side
318940	322280	character, like in That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime.
322280	325140	But pretty much all isekai stories hit the same beats.
325140	327720	The protagonist's life in their original world is pretty shitty.
327720	331160	By random chance, the protagonist encounters a piece of the other world.
331160	334360	Maybe it's a person who crossed over, maybe it's an artifact, but whatever it is, it
334360	336480	inexplicably pulls them across the barrier.
336480	339360	Once on the other side, the protagonist is stuck with no way back.
339360	342160	New friends help the protagonist through the initial period of despair, and they begin
342160	344900	to right wrongs in their new home and grow as a person.
344900	348520	At the climax of the story, they finally have the opportunity to go home, and they take
348520	349520	it.
349520	351300	But once they're back, they realize they've changed too much.
351300	353240	They can't go back to how things used to be.
353240	357080	Their old life sucks, their new life is full of meaningful relationships, and now all they
357080	359360	want to do is go back to the other world again.
359600	362720	Eventually they do, generally just in time for the final confrontation with whatever
362720	365600	villain happens to be at the center of all the events happening in the other world.
365600	369560	A confrontation that our side heroes wouldn't be able to overcome without the protagonist's
369560	370560	return.
370560	373360	It's also revealed at some point that the reason all of this happened in the first place
373360	377760	is because the protagonist, despite having an outwardly mundane life, has had some connection
377760	379440	to the other world this whole time.
379440	382480	Generally because one of their parents has traveled across the barrier in their youth
382480	384600	and secretly settled in our world.
384600	389020	Isekai stories are so old hat that any modern attempt either plays with the formula to make
389020	393300	something new or sarcastically leans into the genre, parodying the whole thing and breaking
393300	395300	the fourth wall constantly.
395300	397300	Forespoken does neither of those things.
397300	401700	In fact, Forespoken is the most by-the-books Isekai story I've ever seen.
401700	403880	It feels like an AI-generated script.
403880	406580	It follows every single convention of the genre.
406580	411160	Frey lives a shit life as a poor black woman on the run from both the law and gangs in
411160	412160	New York City.
412160	415820	She breaks into a building to steal what looks to be a very expensive gold brace.
415860	419900	The brace sucks her into the fantasy world of Athia, from Project Athia, remember, where
419900	422420	she is a mage specializing in Earth magic.
422420	426220	The land is covered in a consuming blight that corrupts all life and turns them into
426220	428660	zombies, and the townsfolk desperately need a hero.
428660	434020	The first three-quarters of the game consists of very generic open-world wandering and fetch-questing
434020	438540	with little in the way of actual plot, until Frey wakes up one day and finds herself back
438540	441380	in New York, this time living a much more comfortable life.
441380	444380	This is the one real deviation from the Isekai convention.
444380	448060	Frey's trip back to her old life ends up being an illusion created by another mage,
448060	451220	which doesn't actually go back, but it serves the same emotional purpose.
451220	455200	After this sequence, the final couple hours of the game is literally just cutscenes.
455200	459380	They seriously dump all of the lore and the story on the player in the final stretch,
459380	461880	expecting us to care when it's actually just really boring.
461880	465500	And the lore that they dump is something that we all predicted within the first hour of
465500	466500	the game.
466500	470940	The blight corrupted the other three mages, called Tantas, powerful wise women who wield
470940	474260	fire, water, and wind magic to complement Frey's Earth magic.
474260	478200	Frey is the daughter of the original Earth Tanta, who in a fit of madness throws her
478200	480220	baby into the portal to New York.
480220	482580	No seriously, she just yeets that fucking kid.
482580	486940	And all of the tomfoolery is caused by her talking gold brace, yeah it talks by the way,
486940	489780	who turns out to be an ancient evil sealed by the Tantas.
489780	492620	This guy, Cuff, is one of the more annoying parts of the game.
492620	496660	He serves as the game's guide, like Navi in Ocarina of Time or Fi in Skyward Sword.
496660	500940	But Cuff is more annoying than any of them, and unlike in the Zelda games, he's not bouncing
500940	504980	off a silent protagonist, he's paired with Frey who is just as fucking annoying.
504980	508060	These two together, they're a dialogue written by millennials who don't know how to take
508060	512260	anything seriously whatsoever and have to insert Marvel-style jokes and quips every
512260	528580	second, make for the cringiest moments in the entire game.
528580	556700	But, to the
556700	560340	game's credit, it's very rare that the tutorial helper becomes the main villain.
560340	564940	Using the Zelda examples again, Navi is just a random fairy, Fi is your sword come to life,
564940	568540	Midna is an important character in her own right but not the villain, and Hel in spirit
568540	573180	tracks, the helper is the spirit of Princess Zelda, serving as both romantic interest and
573180	574180	a ghost.
574180	575180	But a villain?
575180	576620	I can't say I've seen that before, I don't think.
576620	577820	Anyway, that's the whole story.
577820	581020	The entire thing is predictable the minute you realize you're playing an isekai.
581020	585660	It brings nothing new to the table, and nearly everything old that it did, it did very poorly.
585660	587620	But hey, there's more to a game than the story, right?
587620	588980	What about the rest of it?
588980	591220	Well, the game itself looks pretty hideous.
591220	595520	The open world can be pretty sometimes, at least from a breathtaking Vista perspective,
595520	599340	but the actual world itself seems barren, and I don't mean because the blight has depopulated
599340	600340	the land.
600340	603020	It seems unfinished, and sometimes it literally just is unfinished.
603020	606260	The enemies that you fight, from zombies to animals to humans, are all generic but work
606260	607260	well enough.
607260	609140	The characters you meet, though, good god.
609140	613020	You can tell development on this game started in 2012, because it certainly looks like it.
613020	616700	Sometimes, For Spoken looks like it's a PS3 title, not a PS5 one, and the cutscenes
616700	618560	also just look unfinished.
618560	621500	Check this clip out of Frey breaking down a door with her magic.
621500	625180	Not a single muscle twitches on her face, as she blasts the door away, which by the
625180	628400	way, we won't even get to see because the camera cuts away last minute.
628400	631140	Gotta save development time somehow, just don't animate that break-in scene guys,
631140	632480	no one will notice, it'll be okay.
632480	635940	As for what's actually in the open world itself, there's not much.
635940	640060	You can find collectibles, like the same five herbs for potions arranged in the exact same
640060	643540	pattern, like they just copy-paste with a cluster of them, or the same groups of zombies
643540	644700	and wolves.
644700	647540	Sometimes you'll find a dungeon, which is a short set of duplicated hallways with a
647540	648540	boss at the end.
648540	651740	And these can be kind of fun, if only because you're about to get some pretty good loot.
651740	654460	Sometimes you'll find a spring where new spells can be unlocked, but these are few
654460	655460	and far between.
655460	658420	For the most part, there's just nothing to do in the open world.
658420	662020	Despite the low quality of the visuals, this is a demanding game on PC.
662020	665340	The recommended Steam specs are ridiculously high for what you're getting.
665340	668680	Also, the game is 150 gigs dude, what the absolute fuck.
668680	672240	The world's big, but it's not bigger than Skyrim, or Hyrule in Breath of the Wild, or
672240	673800	the Commonwealth in Fallout 4.
673800	677120	The only good part about the graphics are the spell effects, which do legitimately look
677120	678120	magical.
678120	681140	The flaming spear, the orb of water, the glitter that splashes off Frey's shoes when she
681140	683520	runs around with magic speed, it all fits really well.
683520	686520	And considering that the luminous engine was made specifically for those types of effects,
686520	688680	it's no surprise that that's what stands out.
688680	692340	The magic is, in fact, one of the only true positives of the game.
692340	695400	The equipment system allows you to put on different cloaks and necklaces, the only two
695400	698640	equip slots, and you can upgrade them with random bits and bobs you find in the open
698640	700760	world, which is the same as most RPGs.
700760	703640	You can do your nails by putting different runes in them as well.
703640	706220	But all of these systems serve to buff your magic.
706220	708680	The magic is what takes center stage, and it's pretty fun.
708680	711560	It's satisfying to use the wide array of spells at your disposal.
711560	714600	It's cool when you take out one of the tantas and learn their elemental magic, and each
714600	718160	of the four elements has their own skill tree that you plug experience points into in order
718160	720520	to unlock new spells and buff existing ones.
720520	723300	And man, there are so many legitimately fun spells.
723300	726720	You can throw rocks in a rapid succession or charge up for one big blast.
726720	730460	You can swing a flame sword around or toss flame spears that explode on impact.
730460	734860	You can encase enemies in a giant ball of water or fire a horizontal spread of ice shards.
734860	737300	You can throw electric darts or charge up a huge lightning storm.
737300	738300	And more!
738300	741020	There's dozens of spells, all with their own unique effects and feel, and the trailer
741020	743540	to the game has no problem emphasizing the variety.
743540	747580	The issue is, you only unlock the other schools of magic by defeating the tantas, and defeating
747580	749200	the tantas is the whole point of the game.
749200	752820	You spend a huge chunk of the early game with earth magic, unlock fire magic halfway through,
752860	756100	and you really only get a smidge of time with water and wind.
756100	760060	In fact, once you kill the final tanta and unlock the wind magic, that's when the final
760060	761900	two hours of exposition dump begins.
761900	765900	There's no enemies, no challenges, no opportunities to use any of your cool new wind magic.
765900	769580	There's long boring cutscenes telling you stuff you figured out hours ago if you're
769580	773660	smart, punctuated by empty rooms that contain nothing but experience pickups you have to
773660	776540	run around and collect, and an NPC who triggers the next cutscene.
776540	778000	I'm not fucking kidding, dude.
778000	781500	It feels like they knew they just gave you a new skill tree in the final hour of the
781500	785380	game, and said oh shit this is useless unless we just dump a bunch of exp on you so you
785380	786380	can level it up.
786380	790540	In a well designed game, you unlock your core abilities relatively early on, so that the
790540	792600	game has the opportunity to develop their use.
792600	797180	In Zelda Breath of the Wild, you get bombs, magnets, time stop, and ice freeze all in
797180	801260	the opening area of the game, because the entire game is all about using these tools
801260	802600	to solve puzzles.
802600	806620	Even in more linear Zeldas, the most useful tools show up in the early to mid game.
806620	808460	This is elementary stuff in game design.
808460	811740	You can even go back to Secret of Mana on the Super Nintendo, where you unlock every
811740	815220	single magic school with the exception of I think nature magic in the first half of
815220	819580	the game, or Luffyya 2, where the bombs, arrow, and hookshot are all obtained in dungeons
819580	820700	pretty early on.
820700	824300	Any competent game knows to give you the bulk of your kit by the halfway point, so that
824300	828960	you can actually get good at using it, and save only the advanced stuff for later on,
828960	832420	like Knights of the Round in Final Fantasy 7, or the alien weapons in Fallout.
832420	836340	But in Forspoken, you're filling out a completely new skill tree that you'll never actually
836340	837820	use in the final hour.
837820	840440	The other interesting part of the game is movement.
840440	842660	Each school of magic comes with a different movement ability.
842660	846520	You start with magic running and magic parkour, which is the reason that Frey keeps her Air
846520	847900	Jordans from the other world.
847900	849380	In New York, she was a parkour artist.
849380	850380	A parkourist?
850380	851380	Whatever.
851380	854540	Once you gain fire magic, you unlock a grappling hook that feels a lot like the ODM gear from
854540	858540	Attack on Titan, and chaining parkour flips with grapples is legitimately really fun.
858540	862340	With water magic, you unlock surfing, which I had to find a clip of online, because there's
862340	866260	never a reason to ever enter a body of water in this game, where surfing would be required.
866260	869260	And with wind magic, you unlock a quadruple jump, which isn't really that interesting,
869260	872600	because you have to stay in place and charge it in order to do it, breaking the whole flow
872600	874220	feeling of getting around the game.
874220	878600	There is a glider in the game, the float spell, which in my opinion is an open world must-have
878600	882500	ever since Breath of the Wild did it in 2016, but you can only unlock it near the end of
882500	885600	the game, and for some reason it's a water spell, not a wind spell.
885600	888940	In other games that have included gliders, like Zelda or Horizon Forbidden West, you
888940	892920	pick them up early on because game developers realized just how much they aided exploration
892920	894240	and open world environment.
894240	897780	Letting you drift to a location you can see on the horizon from a tall area is actually
897780	898780	really cool.
898780	902040	Putting the float spell at the very end of the game, long after you'd ever need it,
902040	903400	just doesn't make any sense.
903400	906420	You can tell that I'm an old man at this point, considering how many old games and
906420	910280	shows I'm referencing that did parts of what Forsaken tried to do, but better.
910280	912040	Here, I'll put a bowtie on the whole thing.
912040	914920	Forsaken reminds me of Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.
914920	917320	For you zoomers who don't know what that is, here's the TLDR.
917320	921880	In the early 90s, Japanese game developers thought that Americans were too dumb to understand
921880	922880	RPGs.
922880	926760	RPGs were the most popular genre in Japan, but platformers ruled the day in America,
926760	930080	and Square was worried about spending tons of time translating Final Fantasy games only
930080	931440	for them to have a poor reception.
931440	935280	So they had an American development team create what is now derisively known as Baby's
935280	936680	First RPG.
936680	940960	Final Fantasy Mystic Quest has all the mechanics and feeling of a mainline Final Fantasy game
940960	945400	on the Super Nintendo, but with everything drastically dumbed down to make it more accessible.
945400	949680	Now it's still a pretty good game, great music specifically, but oh boy is it easy.
949680	952560	Mystic Quest features easy-to-dodge enemies instead of random encounters.
952560	955560	New armor overwrites old armor instead of actually being equippable.
955560	959080	There's only four weapons in the whole game that you upgrade a couple times.
959080	963160	Items and spells are identical, like a potion and the cure spell do the exact same thing.
963160	966880	The story is laughably simplistic, but at the end of the day, Babydev had a good time
966880	967880	with it.
967880	970080	Playing for Spoken feels like playing Mystic Quest.
970080	973280	Yeah, you can go into dungeons, but they're basically the same thing with similar loot
973280	974280	every time.
974280	976920	Yeah, you can equip necklaces and cloaks, but they don't really offer much in the
976920	980920	way of upgrades beyond just flat bonuses to magic, or sometimes a specific element.
980920	982440	And upgrading them is just a linear progression.
982440	986120	There's no super amazing loot to find that radically changes the game somehow.
986120	987800	Putting runes on your nails is the same thing.
987800	991480	You slap on the 5% damage nails and then wait until you find the 10% damage nails.
991480	992480	Rinse and repeat.
992480	997080	The same herbs craft the same one potion you use all game, and you find them in every single
997080	998080	zone.
998080	1002740	If Mystic Quest was Babby's first JRPG, for Spoken is Babby's first open world game.
1002740	1005740	Everything in it is a dumbed down version of something from a better game.
1005740	1009480	And if for Spoken was only Babys first open world game, there wouldn't be anything wrong
1009480	1010480	with that.
1011040	1014240	If the only issue with the game was simplicity, it would be a perfect game to hand to a kid,
1014240	1017040	or a new gamer or something who wanted to get into it, as a gateway into something more
1017040	1019240	complicated like Fallout or Skyrim.
1019240	1022040	In this context, we can even forgive the paint by numbers storyline.
1022040	1025160	If it's literally your first isekai because you're 6 years old, I'm sure it'll feel
1025160	1026280	magical to you.
1026280	1029920	Though then again, who lets their 6 year old play a game that drops the f-bomb every 30
1029920	1030920	seconds?
1030920	1034000	But it's not only the simplicity, it's the genuinely awful pacing of the game in
1034000	1035560	terms of both plot and mechanics.
1035560	1037160	It's the emptiness of the world.
1037160	1038160	The ugliness of it.
1038160	1041320	It's how the game feels fun for a little bit, until you realize you've just spent
1041320	1044560	hours doing nothing because there's nothing in the game to do, and what little there is
1044560	1045880	is mediocre at best.
1045880	1049720	So it's no surprise that this game got absolutely bombarded by fans online.
1049720	1053680	The Steam page for Spoken looks like the aftermath of a gangbang, and even though there's reports
1053680	1056820	of the developers deleting reviews, it doesn't actually matter that much because the reviews
1056820	1059840	are overwhelmingly negative, too many for them to handle.
1059840	1062940	The Metacritic score doesn't look all that great either, and the game's already seeing
1062940	1064080	some price drops.
1064080	1068120	Square Enix went through all this hassle over the Luminous Engine, only to make two games
1068120	1069080	with it.
1069080	1072360	Final Fantasy XV might have been a success, but For Spoken, which came at the end of the
1072360	1075600	engine's life, seems to be a total flop on multiple dimensions.
1075600	1079840	We're this deep into the video, and I haven't even addressed the elephant in the room.
1079840	1082520	Frey, the main character of For Spoken, is black.
1082520	1083520	Dun dun dun.
1083520	1086200	Now I personally don't care what race the characters in any game are.
1086200	1087200	It shouldn't be an issue.
1087200	1089800	And there are a few idiots out there who are just straight up saying, the main character
1089800	1090800	in the game is black, no thanks.
1090800	1092600	And it's like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
1092600	1094400	No, the problem with Frey isn't that she's black.
1094400	1095600	It's that she's black.
1095600	1097040	Capital B Black.
1097040	1098040	Political Black.
1098040	1102240	You notice that, suddenly a whole bunch of things come into focus, like the way she speaks
1102240	1106500	when engaging with the fantasy world of Athia, or how insistent she is on keeping her Air
1106500	1111240	Jordans so that she can parkour around the wilderness, or how doing her nails up in garish
1111240	1116040	patterns is a core mechanic, or how back in New York she lives in a crack shack but still
1116040	1120540	displays proudly her expensive collection of kicks on a shelf in a central location.
1120540	1123540	For Spoken clearly wants to be like a BLM game.
1123540	1127320	It opens on Frey in court with a rap sheet filled with thefts.
1127360	1130760	She gets a lenient sentence from the judge who takes pity on her, and then she immediately
1130760	1134160	goes out into the streets and gets jumped by a gang that she owes money to or something.
1134160	1137200	I don't know, and it doesn't matter, because I never actually see these characters again anyway.
1137200	1141120	Frey manages to parkour away to safety, but the whole thing stinks of social commentary
1141120	1143720	regarding the black inner-city experience or something.
1143720	1148440	I already don't buy this setup, because this girl is 21, beautiful, and living in 2023.
1148440	1149440	She's got a phone.
1149440	1152480	There's no way she wouldn't start selling OnlyFans, make a bank, and get the fuck out of here.
1152480	1156200	And this discrepancy is made more clear by the fact that they cast one of the hottest
1156240	1158160	chicks around right now to play her.
1158160	1161940	After admiring that shoe collection, she falls asleep back at the crack shack, only to wake
1161940	1163760	up to the whole place on fire.
1163760	1167360	It's pretty clear that the gang lit her apartment up as revenge, and this is when probably the
1167360	1169000	dumbest sequence in the whole game happens.
1169000	1170000	The Homer!
1170000	1172000	Girl, come on, we gotta go!
1177000	1179000	Gotta find Homer first.
1179000	1181000	Gotta find Homer first.
1182000	1184000	Gotta find Homer first.
1184800	1188680	That's right, even though the duffel bag full of her life savings, in cash, is right at
1188680	1192420	her feet, the money she's been scrimping together to be able to move the fuck out of New York
1192420	1197580	for years, the game forces you to leave the money behind to go and find your pet cat.
1197580	1199380	After which, of course, you lose the money.
1199380	1200880	There's no reason for this.
1200880	1203160	It's just right fucking there, dude, just pick it up and go!
1203160	1207160	Frey survives the fire, though, and in desperation looks through the window of a building, sees
1207160	1210120	Cuff, and decides to steal him to make some money, kicking off the adventure.
1210240	1214400	And it's at this point that, beyond Frey's terrible personality, the political content
1214400	1215880	of the game vanishes.
1215880	1219480	They clearly tried to go for some sort of message, but it disappears from the game entirely.
1219480	1223400	It doesn't even come back when she goes into the dreamscape, thinking she's back in her
1223400	1224400	old life again.
1224400	1228240	In fact, in that multi-hour cutscene where the entire plot is dumped at the end, it's
1228240	1232880	revealed that while her mother is a Tanta from Athia, her father is a random black dude
1232880	1234240	from New York named Al.
1234240	1236520	I personally like to think it's Al Roker.
1236520	1237640	But where is the guy?
1237680	1241320	Frey's mother clearly knows him before she gets pregnant, and she didn't get magically
1241320	1245000	transformed into a dragon until after she gave birth and yeeted Frey through the portal.
1245000	1247720	Oh yeah, Frey's mother got transformed into a dragon, but it's not important.
1247720	1249760	The point is, where is Frey's dad?
1249760	1252000	He's not keeping up with the love of his life?
1252000	1254280	The woman that he knocked up from the other fucking dimension?
1254280	1255880	Nah, nobody hears from him again.
1255880	1258720	He's literally the stereotype of the black absentee father.
1258720	1261280	They're really going all out with the representation, eh?
1261280	1264780	However, even with the reveal of Frey's parentage, the political aspect of the game
1264780	1266040	never returns.
1266040	1270440	Frey settles into her new life as the protector of the blissfully deracialized world of Athia,
1270440	1272640	and abandons our world and its problems entirely.
1272640	1273960	Here's the real kicker though.
1273960	1274960	The game's awful.
1274960	1275960	Like, I'd give it a 4 out of 10.
1275960	1278780	But because it has this wallpaper of black politics.
1278780	1281800	Because if you only played the first hour of the game, you might think it's highly
1281800	1282800	politically charged.
1282800	1286920	There's a lot of retarded progressives online right now who think that if you hate the game,
1286920	1288480	it has to be because you're a racist.
1288480	1289480	Can't be any other reason.
1289480	1293120	Can't be that the game is poorly designed, or ugly, or buggy, or not all that fun to
1293120	1294120	play.
1294120	1295720	Because you're a fucking white male.
1295720	1297720	Even if you're not.
1297720	1298720	Is the game good?
1298720	1299720	Yes, the game is good.
1299720	1304600	Fuck social media, get you the game, is what I'm about to be saying.
1304600	1305960	That's gonna be the title.
1305960	1309360	Fuck social media, buy the game, okay?
1309360	1310360	Because people tripping.
1310360	1314400	No, I promise you, if you're playing the game, you're not gonna sit here and be like,
1314400	1319600	oh my god, the dialogue, oh my god, it's so bad, I can't play the game!
1319600	1325480	Because every three seconds, I see someone on social talking about, they see one clip
1325480	1327520	and it's like, that's the whole game.
1327520	1328520	Come on, bro.
1328520	1331520	Damn it, you just stepped on my throat.
1331520	1333320	I just kicked a whole deer, bro.
1333320	1335200	Y'all didn't even see that, for real.
1335200	1341520	If you haven't actually seen anything other than the one clip from a scene that wasn't
1341520	1343960	even that cringey, I don't wanna hear about the dialogue.
1343960	1348000	Like I said, if she looked like any other, anything else, if she looked like anything
1348000	1350400	else and she said the same scene, no one would bat an eye.
1350400	1351400	It would be like, what the hell?
1351400	1352720	It would just be bad writing.
1352720	1356520	Like, it's not the best writing, but it's not a bad game.
1356520	1358280	That's what I'm trying to say.
1358280	1359360	It's not a bad game.
1359360	1360760	It's like the basic writing.
1360760	1361760	It could be better.
1361760	1365120	They probably could have gotten black writers, but they didn't.
1365120	1366120	That's unfortunate.
1366120	1368640	But the game's not ass.
1368640	1372840	Gear and how you heal up and the crafting isn't too much because I hate crafting in
1372840	1375160	the games and the crafting's not overbearing.
1375160	1378680	You get like, you can change these nails that give you different powers.
1378680	1379680	Like, I don't know.
1379680	1380800	I just, I'm fucking with the game.
1380800	1381800	It's a good game.
1381800	1383000	The story is not even horrible.
1383000	1387240	The story is a story, but I ain't like, damn, this plot is ass.
1387240	1391120	I'm following it and I don't follow stories that well.
1391120	1392360	I'm here.
1392360	1395540	And of course, Prague game developers are out here saying the exact same thing.
1395540	1403800	Do I think that some of the energy and vitriol and just discussion about this game is happening
1403800	1413000	because some, but cause it is a lead female black character and it is on a PlayStation
1413000	1414960	game versus an Xbox game.
1414960	1416440	Yes, I do.
1416440	1417440	And then people push back.
1417440	1419800	Well, I haven't seen anything written like that.
1419800	1420800	Really?
1420800	1422040	You can't read between the lines.
1422040	1427680	So do you ever actually see somebody when they're shitting on game pass go, I don't
1427680	1429400	really have an issue with game pass.
1429400	1432480	I just like PlayStation and want Microsoft to lose.
1432480	1436840	Or when someone's being a misogynist, do they own being a misogynist and say, well, here's
1436840	1438760	the real fucking deal.
1438760	1441840	The real fucking deal is a women scare me.
1441840	1442920	I don't really like them.
1442920	1445300	I don't trust them and they don't want to fuck me.
1445300	1447800	That's why I'm really upset about this game.
1447800	1449540	No one talks like that.
1449540	1450540	It's called subtext.
1450540	1455720	So of course you're not seeing people overtly saying I'm not playing for spoken or I'm shitting
1455720	1460720	on for spoken or I am giving an unjust given the success of what it looks like the game
1460720	1466280	is going to have amount of time and energy on the internet and in my writing to first
1466280	1469360	spoken because I'm a racist, they're not going to say that.
1469360	1473160	Oh, and Bakaki wants you to know if you don't stream for spoken tonight, you're a racist
1473160	1474160	and a misogynist.
1474160	1475320	Oh, of course.
1475320	1476320	Of course.
1476320	1479440	If you read sarcasm from that clip, I promise you he was being serious.
1479440	1481060	That's David Scott Jeff.
1481060	1484280	Of course, the polygon review of the game has to dive into this topic as well.
1484280	1487020	And outwardly, they appear to have the same take that I do.
1487020	1491500	Before I wrap up, let's spare a word for Frey, a notionally black protagonist who joins
1491500	1496040	a growing trend in media of putting black people in worlds where race is inconsequential.
1496040	1500340	Except the game is very insistent that Frey is a New Yorker, mysterious birth or not,
1500340	1504240	spending her entire life up until this point growing up in our decidedly non fantasy world
1504240	1506500	where blackness is not a non factor.
1506500	1510540	Regrettably, Frey's identity is thinly written and awkwardly deployed as the story leans
1510540	1514160	not only on stereotypical narratives, but trauma as a plot device.
1514200	1518200	The complaint here is that the political blackness of the game isn't given enough focus.
1518200	1521600	Polygon felt bait and switch by that first hour and wanted it everywhere in the game.
1521600	1522600	I feel the opposite way.
1522600	1523600	I wanted none of it in the game.
1523600	1527800	But if they were going to do it, immediately dispensing with it unceremoniously after making
1527800	1530200	it to Athia is probably the worst way to do it.
1530200	1532040	It feels like they're cowardly or something.
1532040	1535200	What they could have done if they really wanted to make a racialized story correctly is have
1535200	1538520	a different group in Athia, maybe not black Athians, that's two on the nose, make them
1538520	1542480	a cast or a fantasy race or green people or something who are treated poorly due to their
1542480	1543480	birth.
1543480	1546680	And Frey, with her outsider knowledge of race relations on Earth, can shed some light on
1546680	1549320	the problem from a perspective that Athians never considered.
1549320	1551420	You could actually make a good story out of that if you tried.
1551420	1552920	The problem here is no one tried.
1552920	1555380	Before I get out of here, there's one final thing to talk about.
1555380	1556380	Hi-Fi Rush.
1556380	1559900	Hi-Fi Rush is a Bethesda game that looks and plays amazing.
1559900	1563040	Everything about it, the cel-shaded graphics, the rhythm based combat, the soundtrack, all
1563040	1566680	scream 2000s to me, which of course I'm a sucker for considering that was the time
1566680	1568600	period of my high school experience.
1568600	1571920	People online are comparing Hi-Fi Rush's dialogue to first spoken and fair enough,
1571920	1575940	and both swamped in millennial writing, jokes during serious moments, fourth wall breaking
1575940	1576940	stuff, all of it.
1576940	1581540	But the difference is, forespoken is trying to be a serious fantasy adventure, while simultaneously
1581540	1586660	being embarrassed of itself, while Hi-Fi Rush is a jokey Saturday morning cartoon that knows
1586660	1587800	it is a cartoon.
1587800	1591040	The game is in on the joke and it's endearing, and it also knows not to go too overboard
1591040	1592040	with it as well.
1592040	1595200	There's a balance here, Hi-Fi Rush strikes it, forespoken does not.
1595200	1598560	Hi-Fi Rush and forespoken are being compared on the internet right now because they're
1598560	1602440	polar opposites occupying the same space, and it's not just because they both feature
1602440	1603440	millennial writing.
1603440	1607340	They're the only two notable games to come out during January of 2023.
1607340	1611000	Forespoken has a build up of multiple years of the Square Enix hype machine behind it,
1611000	1615180	while Hi-Fi Rush was released the same day it was announced, during a recent Xbox Bethesda
1615180	1618020	developer conference, with no hype behind it at all.
1618020	1622120	Forespoken is an open world game, a bland empty sandbox with nothing to do and nobody
1622120	1626400	interesting in it, while Hi-Fi Rush is a level based hack and slash where each of the environments
1626400	1628960	and characters appear to be lovingly crafted.
1628960	1633340	Forespoken launched at 70 US dollars, Sony paid a boatload of money to make it a two
1633340	1638440	year PS5 console exclusive, and the PC version barely functions unless you've got an amazing
1638440	1642520	graphics card, while Hi-Fi Rush launched for 30 dollars on Xbox and PC.
1642520	1646480	You can play it on your shitty 10 year old computer, and you can even play it on Gamepass.
1646480	1650200	It's no surprise that Hi-Fi Rush basically blew forespoken out of the water in terms
1650200	1651520	of popularity, is it?
1651520	1655720	The progs on Twitter are screeching that gamers are all just racist because the cringe writing
1655720	1659060	in forespoken is identical to Hi-Fi Rush's, but what they don't seem to understand is
1659060	1660680	that context matters.
1660680	1662440	Also making a good fucking game matters too.
1662440	1666080	By the time this video comes out, I have a feeling that the forespoken discourse will
1666080	1669040	have already been fully washed away by Hi-Fi Rush's success.
1669040	1671020	I started this script on February 2nd.
1671020	1675980	The game is so indefensible generic, and people are so tired of being browbeat, that the cries
1675980	1678840	of racist sexist gamers aren't going to do anything this time.
1678840	1681920	The game sucks, and that's too bad because there's an okay skeleton in here.
1681920	1684660	The combat, the movement, and even the skill trees are interesting.
1684660	1687700	They just needed a totally different game packaged around it.
1687700	1690920	Which is funny, because Agni's philosophy did in fact look like a totally different
1690920	1691920	game.
1691920	1695760	Same art style, same engine, same mechanics, same assets, but totally different characters.
1695760	1699360	Forespoken really just feels like Square Enix desperately needed to recoup a lot of money.
1699360	1702800	They had bits and bobs of their games lying around, and they decided to mash it all together
1702800	1707060	and race swap the protagonist to make her black because Black Lives Matter sells.
1707060	1708860	Well, it didn't sell enough.
1708860	1711500	If you're going to get this one, wait for a deep discount, guys.
1711500	1713960	I'm talking like five to ten dollars.
1713960	1716000	This one is not fucking worth it.
