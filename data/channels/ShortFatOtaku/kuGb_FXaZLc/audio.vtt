WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.340
Over on SFO Arcade, we just finished up Fourspoken, the latest PS5 exclusive.

00:17.340 --> 00:19.140
So I guess it's finally time to talk about it.

00:19.140 --> 00:20.200
And yes, it stinks.

00:20.200 --> 00:23.180
I wouldn't break out the indefensible intro and title if it didn't.

00:23.180 --> 00:24.660
Let me give you the history.

00:24.660 --> 00:28.380
Square Enix's early history is one of console exclusivity.

00:28.380 --> 00:31.520
Square games came out only on the NES and then the SNES.

00:31.520 --> 00:36.560
Then they famously jumped ship to Sony, choosing the PlayStation 1 over the Nintendo 64 due

00:36.560 --> 00:40.780
to the latter opting to stick with cartridges that maxed out at 32 megs, while the former

00:40.780 --> 00:44.260
utilized CDs with a storage capacity of 700 megs.

00:44.260 --> 00:48.540
Back in the 90s, Square made the claim that Final Fantasy VII just wouldn't fit on a

00:48.540 --> 00:49.540
cartridge.

00:49.540 --> 00:53.240
And as a kid of the 90s, let me tell you, this fueled a lot of schoolyard fights.

00:53.240 --> 00:57.620
Square continued to be exclusive to Sony during the PlayStation 2, for the most part.

00:57.620 --> 01:02.460
This strategy of Square Enix exclusivity worked because each of these console generations

01:02.460 --> 01:03.580
had a clear winner.

01:03.580 --> 01:07.640
The console that Square had backed was wildly more popular than the other options.

01:07.640 --> 01:11.980
But with the seventh generation of consoles, that's the Wii, Xbox 360, and PS3 by the

01:11.980 --> 01:14.620
way, all three of them were exceptionally popular.

01:14.620 --> 01:18.340
And Square Enix realized that remaining loyal to Sony meant losing money.

01:18.340 --> 01:22.580
So they developed a proprietary engine called Crystal Tools, meant to streamline the production

01:22.580 --> 01:27.140
of their big upcoming title, Final Fantasy XIII, making it easy to run on multiple platforms.

01:27.180 --> 01:28.980
The only problem is, it sucked.

01:28.980 --> 01:32.780
Crystal Tools ended up being a huge Square Enix boondoggle, delaying the release of Final

01:32.780 --> 01:36.820
Fantasy XIII by almost two years, while offering little to no value.

01:36.820 --> 01:40.900
By 2011, the Crystal Tools engine had already been pushed to its breaking point during the

01:40.900 --> 01:43.220
development of Final Fantasy XIII-2.

01:43.220 --> 01:46.080
Cracks were showing, and Square Enix needed something else, if it was going to be able

01:46.080 --> 01:48.580
to keep up on the PS4 and Xbox One.

01:48.580 --> 01:52.380
You'd think, after the failure of Crystal Tools, Square would be smart enough to not

01:52.380 --> 01:57.180
do this again, and maybe they'd use more conventional, more functional, more well-documented

01:57.180 --> 01:58.180
developer tools.

01:58.180 --> 02:00.860
Maybe license an engine, like Unreal or Unity or something.

02:00.860 --> 02:02.580
But no, they made the exact same mistake.

02:02.580 --> 02:06.740
To solve their Crystal Tools problem, Square Enix developed the Luminous engine in 2012,

02:06.740 --> 02:10.860
and showed it off at the E3 of that year with the tech demo Agni's Philosophy.

02:10.860 --> 02:12.820
Now if this looks familiar, that's because it should.

02:12.820 --> 02:17.320
A lot of it ended up becoming forespoken ten years later, which is also why huge chunks

02:17.320 --> 02:19.700
of forespoken look about ten years old.

02:19.700 --> 02:23.620
The Luminous engine ended up having all the same problems that Crystal Tools did, becoming

02:23.620 --> 02:25.560
another giant money pit for the company.

02:25.560 --> 02:31.140
To date, only two games have used the Luminous engine, Final Fantasy XV in 2016, and forespoken

02:31.140 --> 02:33.720
in 2023, eleven years later.

02:33.720 --> 02:39.180
So a broken engine, decade-old art assets, last-ditch attempt to recoup monumental cost.

02:39.180 --> 02:40.580
Forespoken's off to a great start, isn't it?

02:40.580 --> 02:41.580
What else could go wrong?

02:41.580 --> 02:45.140
Well, it was officially announced three years ago as Project Athia.

02:45.140 --> 02:49.060
And when you go back and watch that old 2020 trailer, you can see a lot of the pieces that

02:49.060 --> 02:51.260
would come together to later be forespoken.

02:51.260 --> 02:53.520
These locations, that dragon, it's all in the game.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.180
But this trailer was considered to be a huge joke.

02:56.180 --> 03:00.380
Look closely, she's not wearing boots or some kind of era-appropriate footwear, she's

03:00.380 --> 03:01.380
wearing kicks.

03:01.380 --> 03:02.380
Air Jordans, baby!

03:02.380 --> 03:04.700
That's when we all knew we were in for a fucking ride.

03:04.700 --> 03:07.740
I'm going to spoil everything about forespoken because I don't care.

03:07.740 --> 03:10.660
You shouldn't either, but if for some dumb reason you do, now's your chance to bail

03:10.660 --> 03:11.660
out.

03:11.660 --> 03:15.220
The plot of forespoken is the most bog-standard isekai plot I've ever seen.

03:15.220 --> 03:19.260
Isekai is a Japanese word meaning different world, and it refers to a genre of storytelling

03:19.260 --> 03:23.660
where a character from world A inexplicably finds themselves in world B and has to contend

03:23.660 --> 03:24.660
with a sudden upheaval.

03:24.660 --> 03:28.460
It's basically a fantastical version of the fish-out-of-water story, even though the

03:28.460 --> 03:32.940
word isekai didn't really start to be used until the glut of 80s and 90s anime that used

03:32.940 --> 03:33.940
the trope.

03:33.940 --> 03:35.600
This type of story has existed for quite a while.

03:35.600 --> 03:39.720
The quintessential Western isekai, for example, is Alice in Wonderland, and looking at Alice

03:39.720 --> 03:42.060
gives us a basic idea of what the rules are.

03:42.060 --> 03:46.340
One, the world that the protagonist originates from is generally the modern real world, at

03:46.340 --> 03:47.740
the time the story was written.

03:47.740 --> 03:51.580
In Alice, that's Victorian England, while in Vision of Escaflowne, for example, that's

03:51.580 --> 03:52.620
90s Japan.

03:52.620 --> 03:56.660
Rule two, what differentiates isekai from a normal travel epic like Lord of the Rings

03:56.660 --> 04:00.700
or Journey to the West, is that the protagonist in an isekai doesn't go on a daunting yet

04:00.700 --> 04:03.360
physically possible journey like crossing a continent.

04:03.360 --> 04:08.500
The journey is seemingly an impossible one, making the quest to get back home nigh insurmountable.

04:08.500 --> 04:12.140
In Alice, Wonderland is sometimes portrayed as an alternate dimension, and sometimes as

04:12.140 --> 04:13.140
Alice's own psyche.

04:13.140 --> 04:17.420
In Escaflowne, Gaia is an invisible, habitable planet caught in Earth's orbit.

04:17.420 --> 04:20.660
In Digimon, the characters go into a physical representation of the internet.

04:20.660 --> 04:24.160
In The Black Knight or A Kid in King Arthur's Court or Chrono Trigger, the characters are

04:24.160 --> 04:26.580
flung through time with seemingly no way back.

04:26.580 --> 04:31.260
In a countless number of isekai anime, especially pornographic ones, as well as those old cartoon

04:31.260 --> 04:34.940
shows, where your average kid gets sucked into the TV like Captain N, the alternate

04:34.940 --> 04:36.960
world operates like a video game.

04:37.760 --> 04:41.680
Some people are tempted to call a movie like Avatar an isekai, since the trip to Pandora

04:41.680 --> 04:42.880
is through deep space.

04:42.880 --> 04:46.880
Maybe, maybe not, but I think it's not an isekai because of the third rule.

04:46.880 --> 04:50.920
The protagonist has to be somewhat isolated, and must adapt to living in a totally alien

04:50.920 --> 04:51.920
culture.

04:51.920 --> 04:54.040
In Alice and Escaflowne, the characters are alone.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.920
In Digimon, it's a small group of kids.

04:55.920 --> 05:00.120
To contrast, in Avatar, a ton of humans have moved to Pandora and set up shop, recreating

05:00.120 --> 05:01.460
Earth-like habitats.

05:01.460 --> 05:03.480
Of course, people have played around with the genre.

05:03.480 --> 05:07.380
Sometimes you'll see a reverse isekai, like Beastmaster 2 or Thor, where the protagonist

05:07.380 --> 05:10.940
is from a fantasy world and crosses the dimensions that come to our world.

05:10.940 --> 05:14.000
Sometimes the protagonist doesn't adopt the role of a prophesized hero in the other

05:14.000 --> 05:18.940
world, and instead becomes a villain, like in My Next Life as a Villainess, or as a side

05:18.940 --> 05:22.280
character, like in That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.140
But pretty much all isekai stories hit the same beats.

05:25.140 --> 05:27.720
The protagonist's life in their original world is pretty shitty.

05:27.720 --> 05:31.160
By random chance, the protagonist encounters a piece of the other world.

05:31.160 --> 05:34.360
Maybe it's a person who crossed over, maybe it's an artifact, but whatever it is, it

05:34.360 --> 05:36.480
inexplicably pulls them across the barrier.

05:36.480 --> 05:39.360
Once on the other side, the protagonist is stuck with no way back.

05:39.360 --> 05:42.160
New friends help the protagonist through the initial period of despair, and they begin

05:42.160 --> 05:44.900
to right wrongs in their new home and grow as a person.

05:44.900 --> 05:48.520
At the climax of the story, they finally have the opportunity to go home, and they take

05:48.520 --> 05:49.520
it.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.300
But once they're back, they realize they've changed too much.

05:51.300 --> 05:53.240
They can't go back to how things used to be.

05:53.240 --> 05:57.080
Their old life sucks, their new life is full of meaningful relationships, and now all they

05:57.080 --> 05:59.360
want to do is go back to the other world again.

05:59.600 --> 06:02.720
Eventually they do, generally just in time for the final confrontation with whatever

06:02.720 --> 06:05.600
villain happens to be at the center of all the events happening in the other world.

06:05.600 --> 06:09.560
A confrontation that our side heroes wouldn't be able to overcome without the protagonist's

06:09.560 --> 06:10.560
return.

06:10.560 --> 06:13.360
It's also revealed at some point that the reason all of this happened in the first place

06:13.360 --> 06:17.760
is because the protagonist, despite having an outwardly mundane life, has had some connection

06:17.760 --> 06:19.440
to the other world this whole time.

06:19.440 --> 06:22.480
Generally because one of their parents has traveled across the barrier in their youth

06:22.480 --> 06:24.600
and secretly settled in our world.

06:24.600 --> 06:29.020
Isekai stories are so old hat that any modern attempt either plays with the formula to make

06:29.020 --> 06:33.300
something new or sarcastically leans into the genre, parodying the whole thing and breaking

06:33.300 --> 06:35.300
the fourth wall constantly.

06:35.300 --> 06:37.300
Forespoken does neither of those things.

06:37.300 --> 06:41.700
In fact, Forespoken is the most by-the-books Isekai story I've ever seen.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.880
It feels like an AI-generated script.

06:43.880 --> 06:46.580
It follows every single convention of the genre.

06:46.580 --> 06:51.160
Frey lives a shit life as a poor black woman on the run from both the law and gangs in

06:51.160 --> 06:52.160
New York City.

06:52.160 --> 06:55.820
She breaks into a building to steal what looks to be a very expensive gold brace.

06:55.860 --> 06:59.900
The brace sucks her into the fantasy world of Athia, from Project Athia, remember, where

06:59.900 --> 07:02.420
she is a mage specializing in Earth magic.

07:02.420 --> 07:06.220
The land is covered in a consuming blight that corrupts all life and turns them into

07:06.220 --> 07:08.660
zombies, and the townsfolk desperately need a hero.

07:08.660 --> 07:14.020
The first three-quarters of the game consists of very generic open-world wandering and fetch-questing

07:14.020 --> 07:18.540
with little in the way of actual plot, until Frey wakes up one day and finds herself back

07:18.540 --> 07:21.380
in New York, this time living a much more comfortable life.

07:21.380 --> 07:24.380
This is the one real deviation from the Isekai convention.

07:24.380 --> 07:28.060
Frey's trip back to her old life ends up being an illusion created by another mage,

07:28.060 --> 07:31.220
which doesn't actually go back, but it serves the same emotional purpose.

07:31.220 --> 07:35.200
After this sequence, the final couple hours of the game is literally just cutscenes.

07:35.200 --> 07:39.380
They seriously dump all of the lore and the story on the player in the final stretch,

07:39.380 --> 07:41.880
expecting us to care when it's actually just really boring.

07:41.880 --> 07:45.500
And the lore that they dump is something that we all predicted within the first hour of

07:45.500 --> 07:46.500
the game.

07:46.500 --> 07:50.940
The blight corrupted the other three mages, called Tantas, powerful wise women who wield

07:50.940 --> 07:54.260
fire, water, and wind magic to complement Frey's Earth magic.

07:54.260 --> 07:58.200
Frey is the daughter of the original Earth Tanta, who in a fit of madness throws her

07:58.200 --> 08:00.220
baby into the portal to New York.

08:00.220 --> 08:02.580
No seriously, she just yeets that fucking kid.

08:02.580 --> 08:06.940
And all of the tomfoolery is caused by her talking gold brace, yeah it talks by the way,

08:06.940 --> 08:09.780
who turns out to be an ancient evil sealed by the Tantas.

08:09.780 --> 08:12.620
This guy, Cuff, is one of the more annoying parts of the game.

08:12.620 --> 08:16.660
He serves as the game's guide, like Navi in Ocarina of Time or Fi in Skyward Sword.

08:16.660 --> 08:20.940
But Cuff is more annoying than any of them, and unlike in the Zelda games, he's not bouncing

08:20.940 --> 08:24.980
off a silent protagonist, he's paired with Frey who is just as fucking annoying.

08:24.980 --> 08:28.060
These two together, they're a dialogue written by millennials who don't know how to take

08:28.060 --> 08:32.260
anything seriously whatsoever and have to insert Marvel-style jokes and quips every

08:32.260 --> 08:48.580
second, make for the cringiest moments in the entire game.

08:48.580 --> 09:16.700
But, to the

09:16.700 --> 09:20.340
game's credit, it's very rare that the tutorial helper becomes the main villain.

09:20.340 --> 09:24.940
Using the Zelda examples again, Navi is just a random fairy, Fi is your sword come to life,

09:24.940 --> 09:28.540
Midna is an important character in her own right but not the villain, and Hel in spirit

09:28.540 --> 09:33.180
tracks, the helper is the spirit of Princess Zelda, serving as both romantic interest and

09:33.180 --> 09:34.180
a ghost.

09:34.180 --> 09:35.180
But a villain?

09:35.180 --> 09:36.620
I can't say I've seen that before, I don't think.

09:36.620 --> 09:37.820
Anyway, that's the whole story.

09:37.820 --> 09:41.020
The entire thing is predictable the minute you realize you're playing an isekai.

09:41.020 --> 09:45.660
It brings nothing new to the table, and nearly everything old that it did, it did very poorly.

09:45.660 --> 09:47.620
But hey, there's more to a game than the story, right?

09:47.620 --> 09:48.980
What about the rest of it?

09:48.980 --> 09:51.220
Well, the game itself looks pretty hideous.

09:51.220 --> 09:55.520
The open world can be pretty sometimes, at least from a breathtaking Vista perspective,

09:55.520 --> 09:59.340
but the actual world itself seems barren, and I don't mean because the blight has depopulated

09:59.340 --> 10:00.340
the land.

10:00.340 --> 10:03.020
It seems unfinished, and sometimes it literally just is unfinished.

10:03.020 --> 10:06.260
The enemies that you fight, from zombies to animals to humans, are all generic but work

10:06.260 --> 10:07.260
well enough.

10:07.260 --> 10:09.140
The characters you meet, though, good god.

10:09.140 --> 10:13.020
You can tell development on this game started in 2012, because it certainly looks like it.

10:13.020 --> 10:16.700
Sometimes, For Spoken looks like it's a PS3 title, not a PS5 one, and the cutscenes

10:16.700 --> 10:18.560
also just look unfinished.

10:18.560 --> 10:21.500
Check this clip out of Frey breaking down a door with her magic.

10:21.500 --> 10:25.180
Not a single muscle twitches on her face, as she blasts the door away, which by the

10:25.180 --> 10:28.400
way, we won't even get to see because the camera cuts away last minute.

10:28.400 --> 10:31.140
Gotta save development time somehow, just don't animate that break-in scene guys,

10:31.140 --> 10:32.480
no one will notice, it'll be okay.

10:32.480 --> 10:35.940
As for what's actually in the open world itself, there's not much.

10:35.940 --> 10:40.060
You can find collectibles, like the same five herbs for potions arranged in the exact same

10:40.060 --> 10:43.540
pattern, like they just copy-paste with a cluster of them, or the same groups of zombies

10:43.540 --> 10:44.700
and wolves.

10:44.700 --> 10:47.540
Sometimes you'll find a dungeon, which is a short set of duplicated hallways with a

10:47.540 --> 10:48.540
boss at the end.

10:48.540 --> 10:51.740
And these can be kind of fun, if only because you're about to get some pretty good loot.

10:51.740 --> 10:54.460
Sometimes you'll find a spring where new spells can be unlocked, but these are few

10:54.460 --> 10:55.460
and far between.

10:55.460 --> 10:58.420
For the most part, there's just nothing to do in the open world.

10:58.420 --> 11:02.020
Despite the low quality of the visuals, this is a demanding game on PC.

11:02.020 --> 11:05.340
The recommended Steam specs are ridiculously high for what you're getting.

11:05.340 --> 11:08.680
Also, the game is 150 gigs dude, what the absolute fuck.

11:08.680 --> 11:12.240
The world's big, but it's not bigger than Skyrim, or Hyrule in Breath of the Wild, or

11:12.240 --> 11:13.800
the Commonwealth in Fallout 4.

11:13.800 --> 11:17.120
The only good part about the graphics are the spell effects, which do legitimately look

11:17.120 --> 11:18.120
magical.

11:18.120 --> 11:21.140
The flaming spear, the orb of water, the glitter that splashes off Frey's shoes when she

11:21.140 --> 11:23.520
runs around with magic speed, it all fits really well.

11:23.520 --> 11:26.520
And considering that the luminous engine was made specifically for those types of effects,

11:26.520 --> 11:28.680
it's no surprise that that's what stands out.

11:28.680 --> 11:32.340
The magic is, in fact, one of the only true positives of the game.

11:32.340 --> 11:35.400
The equipment system allows you to put on different cloaks and necklaces, the only two

11:35.400 --> 11:38.640
equip slots, and you can upgrade them with random bits and bobs you find in the open

11:38.640 --> 11:40.760
world, which is the same as most RPGs.

11:40.760 --> 11:43.640
You can do your nails by putting different runes in them as well.

11:43.640 --> 11:46.220
But all of these systems serve to buff your magic.

11:46.220 --> 11:48.680
The magic is what takes center stage, and it's pretty fun.

11:48.680 --> 11:51.560
It's satisfying to use the wide array of spells at your disposal.

11:51.560 --> 11:54.600
It's cool when you take out one of the tantas and learn their elemental magic, and each

11:54.600 --> 11:58.160
of the four elements has their own skill tree that you plug experience points into in order

11:58.160 --> 12:00.520
to unlock new spells and buff existing ones.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.300
And man, there are so many legitimately fun spells.

12:03.300 --> 12:06.720
You can throw rocks in a rapid succession or charge up for one big blast.

12:06.720 --> 12:10.460
You can swing a flame sword around or toss flame spears that explode on impact.

12:10.460 --> 12:14.860
You can encase enemies in a giant ball of water or fire a horizontal spread of ice shards.

12:14.860 --> 12:17.300
You can throw electric darts or charge up a huge lightning storm.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.300
And more!

12:18.300 --> 12:21.020
There's dozens of spells, all with their own unique effects and feel, and the trailer

12:21.020 --> 12:23.540
to the game has no problem emphasizing the variety.

12:23.540 --> 12:27.580
The issue is, you only unlock the other schools of magic by defeating the tantas, and defeating

12:27.580 --> 12:29.200
the tantas is the whole point of the game.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.820
You spend a huge chunk of the early game with earth magic, unlock fire magic halfway through,

12:32.860 --> 12:36.100
and you really only get a smidge of time with water and wind.

12:36.100 --> 12:40.060
In fact, once you kill the final tanta and unlock the wind magic, that's when the final

12:40.060 --> 12:41.900
two hours of exposition dump begins.

12:41.900 --> 12:45.900
There's no enemies, no challenges, no opportunities to use any of your cool new wind magic.

12:45.900 --> 12:49.580
There's long boring cutscenes telling you stuff you figured out hours ago if you're

12:49.580 --> 12:53.660
smart, punctuated by empty rooms that contain nothing but experience pickups you have to

12:53.660 --> 12:56.540
run around and collect, and an NPC who triggers the next cutscene.

12:56.540 --> 12:58.000
I'm not fucking kidding, dude.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.500
It feels like they knew they just gave you a new skill tree in the final hour of the

13:01.500 --> 13:05.380
game, and said oh shit this is useless unless we just dump a bunch of exp on you so you

13:05.380 --> 13:06.380
can level it up.

13:06.380 --> 13:10.540
In a well designed game, you unlock your core abilities relatively early on, so that the

13:10.540 --> 13:12.600
game has the opportunity to develop their use.

13:12.600 --> 13:17.180
In Zelda Breath of the Wild, you get bombs, magnets, time stop, and ice freeze all in

13:17.180 --> 13:21.260
the opening area of the game, because the entire game is all about using these tools

13:21.260 --> 13:22.600
to solve puzzles.

13:22.600 --> 13:26.620
Even in more linear Zeldas, the most useful tools show up in the early to mid game.

13:26.620 --> 13:28.460
This is elementary stuff in game design.

13:28.460 --> 13:31.740
You can even go back to Secret of Mana on the Super Nintendo, where you unlock every

13:31.740 --> 13:35.220
single magic school with the exception of I think nature magic in the first half of

13:35.220 --> 13:39.580
the game, or Luffyya 2, where the bombs, arrow, and hookshot are all obtained in dungeons

13:39.580 --> 13:40.700
pretty early on.

13:40.700 --> 13:44.300
Any competent game knows to give you the bulk of your kit by the halfway point, so that

13:44.300 --> 13:48.960
you can actually get good at using it, and save only the advanced stuff for later on,

13:48.960 --> 13:52.420
like Knights of the Round in Final Fantasy 7, or the alien weapons in Fallout.

13:52.420 --> 13:56.340
But in Forspoken, you're filling out a completely new skill tree that you'll never actually

13:56.340 --> 13:57.820
use in the final hour.

13:57.820 --> 14:00.440
The other interesting part of the game is movement.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.660
Each school of magic comes with a different movement ability.

14:02.660 --> 14:06.520
You start with magic running and magic parkour, which is the reason that Frey keeps her Air

14:06.520 --> 14:07.900
Jordans from the other world.

14:07.900 --> 14:09.380
In New York, she was a parkour artist.

14:09.380 --> 14:10.380
A parkourist?

14:10.380 --> 14:11.380
Whatever.

14:11.380 --> 14:14.540
Once you gain fire magic, you unlock a grappling hook that feels a lot like the ODM gear from

14:14.540 --> 14:18.540
Attack on Titan, and chaining parkour flips with grapples is legitimately really fun.

14:18.540 --> 14:22.340
With water magic, you unlock surfing, which I had to find a clip of online, because there's

14:22.340 --> 14:26.260
never a reason to ever enter a body of water in this game, where surfing would be required.

14:26.260 --> 14:29.260
And with wind magic, you unlock a quadruple jump, which isn't really that interesting,

14:29.260 --> 14:32.600
because you have to stay in place and charge it in order to do it, breaking the whole flow

14:32.600 --> 14:34.220
feeling of getting around the game.

14:34.220 --> 14:38.600
There is a glider in the game, the float spell, which in my opinion is an open world must-have

14:38.600 --> 14:42.500
ever since Breath of the Wild did it in 2016, but you can only unlock it near the end of

14:42.500 --> 14:45.600
the game, and for some reason it's a water spell, not a wind spell.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.940
In other games that have included gliders, like Zelda or Horizon Forbidden West, you

14:48.940 --> 14:52.920
pick them up early on because game developers realized just how much they aided exploration

14:52.920 --> 14:54.240
and open world environment.

14:54.240 --> 14:57.780
Letting you drift to a location you can see on the horizon from a tall area is actually

14:57.780 --> 14:58.780
really cool.

14:58.780 --> 15:02.040
Putting the float spell at the very end of the game, long after you'd ever need it,

15:02.040 --> 15:03.400
just doesn't make any sense.

15:03.400 --> 15:06.420
You can tell that I'm an old man at this point, considering how many old games and

15:06.420 --> 15:10.280
shows I'm referencing that did parts of what Forsaken tried to do, but better.

15:10.280 --> 15:12.040
Here, I'll put a bowtie on the whole thing.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.920
Forsaken reminds me of Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.320
For you zoomers who don't know what that is, here's the TLDR.

15:17.320 --> 15:21.880
In the early 90s, Japanese game developers thought that Americans were too dumb to understand

15:21.880 --> 15:22.880
RPGs.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.760
RPGs were the most popular genre in Japan, but platformers ruled the day in America,

15:26.760 --> 15:30.080
and Square was worried about spending tons of time translating Final Fantasy games only

15:30.080 --> 15:31.440
for them to have a poor reception.

15:31.440 --> 15:35.280
So they had an American development team create what is now derisively known as Baby's

15:35.280 --> 15:36.680
First RPG.

15:36.680 --> 15:40.960
Final Fantasy Mystic Quest has all the mechanics and feeling of a mainline Final Fantasy game

15:40.960 --> 15:45.400
on the Super Nintendo, but with everything drastically dumbed down to make it more accessible.

15:45.400 --> 15:49.680
Now it's still a pretty good game, great music specifically, but oh boy is it easy.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.560
Mystic Quest features easy-to-dodge enemies instead of random encounters.

15:52.560 --> 15:55.560
New armor overwrites old armor instead of actually being equippable.

15:55.560 --> 15:59.080
There's only four weapons in the whole game that you upgrade a couple times.

15:59.080 --> 16:03.160
Items and spells are identical, like a potion and the cure spell do the exact same thing.

16:03.160 --> 16:06.880
The story is laughably simplistic, but at the end of the day, Babydev had a good time

16:06.880 --> 16:07.880
with it.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.080
Playing for Spoken feels like playing Mystic Quest.

16:10.080 --> 16:13.280
Yeah, you can go into dungeons, but they're basically the same thing with similar loot

16:13.280 --> 16:14.280
every time.

16:14.280 --> 16:16.920
Yeah, you can equip necklaces and cloaks, but they don't really offer much in the

16:16.920 --> 16:20.920
way of upgrades beyond just flat bonuses to magic, or sometimes a specific element.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.440
And upgrading them is just a linear progression.

16:22.440 --> 16:26.120
There's no super amazing loot to find that radically changes the game somehow.

16:26.120 --> 16:27.800
Putting runes on your nails is the same thing.

16:27.800 --> 16:31.480
You slap on the 5% damage nails and then wait until you find the 10% damage nails.

16:31.480 --> 16:32.480
Rinse and repeat.

16:32.480 --> 16:37.080
The same herbs craft the same one potion you use all game, and you find them in every single

16:37.080 --> 16:38.080
zone.

16:38.080 --> 16:42.740
If Mystic Quest was Babby's first JRPG, for Spoken is Babby's first open world game.

16:42.740 --> 16:45.740
Everything in it is a dumbed down version of something from a better game.

16:45.740 --> 16:49.480
And if for Spoken was only Babys first open world game, there wouldn't be anything wrong

16:49.480 --> 16:50.480
with that.

16:51.040 --> 16:54.240
If the only issue with the game was simplicity, it would be a perfect game to hand to a kid,

16:54.240 --> 16:57.040
or a new gamer or something who wanted to get into it, as a gateway into something more

16:57.040 --> 16:59.240
complicated like Fallout or Skyrim.

16:59.240 --> 17:02.040
In this context, we can even forgive the paint by numbers storyline.

17:02.040 --> 17:05.160
If it's literally your first isekai because you're 6 years old, I'm sure it'll feel

17:05.160 --> 17:06.280
magical to you.

17:06.280 --> 17:09.920
Though then again, who lets their 6 year old play a game that drops the f-bomb every 30

17:09.920 --> 17:10.920
seconds?

17:10.920 --> 17:14.000
But it's not only the simplicity, it's the genuinely awful pacing of the game in

17:14.000 --> 17:15.560
terms of both plot and mechanics.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.160
It's the emptiness of the world.

17:17.160 --> 17:18.160
The ugliness of it.

17:18.160 --> 17:21.320
It's how the game feels fun for a little bit, until you realize you've just spent

17:21.320 --> 17:24.560
hours doing nothing because there's nothing in the game to do, and what little there is

17:24.560 --> 17:25.880
is mediocre at best.

17:25.880 --> 17:29.720
So it's no surprise that this game got absolutely bombarded by fans online.

17:29.720 --> 17:33.680
The Steam page for Spoken looks like the aftermath of a gangbang, and even though there's reports

17:33.680 --> 17:36.820
of the developers deleting reviews, it doesn't actually matter that much because the reviews

17:36.820 --> 17:39.840
are overwhelmingly negative, too many for them to handle.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.940
The Metacritic score doesn't look all that great either, and the game's already seeing

17:42.940 --> 17:44.080
some price drops.

17:44.080 --> 17:48.120
Square Enix went through all this hassle over the Luminous Engine, only to make two games

17:48.120 --> 17:49.080
with it.

17:49.080 --> 17:52.360
Final Fantasy XV might have been a success, but For Spoken, which came at the end of the

17:52.360 --> 17:55.600
engine's life, seems to be a total flop on multiple dimensions.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.840
We're this deep into the video, and I haven't even addressed the elephant in the room.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.520
Frey, the main character of For Spoken, is black.

18:02.520 --> 18:03.520
Dun dun dun.

18:03.520 --> 18:06.200
Now I personally don't care what race the characters in any game are.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.200
It shouldn't be an issue.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.800
And there are a few idiots out there who are just straight up saying, the main character

18:09.800 --> 18:10.800
in the game is black, no thanks.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.600
And it's like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

18:12.600 --> 18:14.400
No, the problem with Frey isn't that she's black.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.600
It's that she's black.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.040
Capital B Black.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.040
Political Black.

18:18.040 --> 18:22.240
You notice that, suddenly a whole bunch of things come into focus, like the way she speaks

18:22.240 --> 18:26.500
when engaging with the fantasy world of Athia, or how insistent she is on keeping her Air

18:26.500 --> 18:31.240
Jordans so that she can parkour around the wilderness, or how doing her nails up in garish

18:31.240 --> 18:36.040
patterns is a core mechanic, or how back in New York she lives in a crack shack but still

18:36.040 --> 18:40.540
displays proudly her expensive collection of kicks on a shelf in a central location.

18:40.540 --> 18:43.540
For Spoken clearly wants to be like a BLM game.

18:43.540 --> 18:47.320
It opens on Frey in court with a rap sheet filled with thefts.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.760
She gets a lenient sentence from the judge who takes pity on her, and then she immediately

18:50.760 --> 18:54.160
goes out into the streets and gets jumped by a gang that she owes money to or something.

18:54.160 --> 18:57.200
I don't know, and it doesn't matter, because I never actually see these characters again anyway.

18:57.200 --> 19:01.120
Frey manages to parkour away to safety, but the whole thing stinks of social commentary

19:01.120 --> 19:03.720
regarding the black inner-city experience or something.

19:03.720 --> 19:08.440
I already don't buy this setup, because this girl is 21, beautiful, and living in 2023.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.440
She's got a phone.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.480
There's no way she wouldn't start selling OnlyFans, make a bank, and get the fuck out of here.

19:12.480 --> 19:16.200
And this discrepancy is made more clear by the fact that they cast one of the hottest

19:16.240 --> 19:18.160
chicks around right now to play her.

19:18.160 --> 19:21.940
After admiring that shoe collection, she falls asleep back at the crack shack, only to wake

19:21.940 --> 19:23.760
up to the whole place on fire.

19:23.760 --> 19:27.360
It's pretty clear that the gang lit her apartment up as revenge, and this is when probably the

19:27.360 --> 19:29.000
dumbest sequence in the whole game happens.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
The Homer!

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Girl, come on, we gotta go!

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Gotta find Homer first.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Gotta find Homer first.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Gotta find Homer first.

19:44.800 --> 19:48.680
That's right, even though the duffel bag full of her life savings, in cash, is right at

19:48.680 --> 19:52.420
her feet, the money she's been scrimping together to be able to move the fuck out of New York

19:52.420 --> 19:57.580
for years, the game forces you to leave the money behind to go and find your pet cat.

19:57.580 --> 19:59.380
After which, of course, you lose the money.

19:59.380 --> 20:00.880
There's no reason for this.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.160
It's just right fucking there, dude, just pick it up and go!

20:03.160 --> 20:07.160
Frey survives the fire, though, and in desperation looks through the window of a building, sees

20:07.160 --> 20:10.120
Cuff, and decides to steal him to make some money, kicking off the adventure.

20:10.240 --> 20:14.400
And it's at this point that, beyond Frey's terrible personality, the political content

20:14.400 --> 20:15.880
of the game vanishes.

20:15.880 --> 20:19.480
They clearly tried to go for some sort of message, but it disappears from the game entirely.

20:19.480 --> 20:23.400
It doesn't even come back when she goes into the dreamscape, thinking she's back in her

20:23.400 --> 20:24.400
old life again.

20:24.400 --> 20:28.240
In fact, in that multi-hour cutscene where the entire plot is dumped at the end, it's

20:28.240 --> 20:32.880
revealed that while her mother is a Tanta from Athia, her father is a random black dude

20:32.880 --> 20:34.240
from New York named Al.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.520
I personally like to think it's Al Roker.

20:36.520 --> 20:37.640
But where is the guy?

20:37.680 --> 20:41.320
Frey's mother clearly knows him before she gets pregnant, and she didn't get magically

20:41.320 --> 20:45.000
transformed into a dragon until after she gave birth and yeeted Frey through the portal.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.720
Oh yeah, Frey's mother got transformed into a dragon, but it's not important.

20:47.720 --> 20:49.760
The point is, where is Frey's dad?

20:49.760 --> 20:52.000
He's not keeping up with the love of his life?

20:52.000 --> 20:54.280
The woman that he knocked up from the other fucking dimension?

20:54.280 --> 20:55.880
Nah, nobody hears from him again.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.720
He's literally the stereotype of the black absentee father.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.280
They're really going all out with the representation, eh?

21:01.280 --> 21:04.780
However, even with the reveal of Frey's parentage, the political aspect of the game

21:04.780 --> 21:06.040
never returns.

21:06.040 --> 21:10.440
Frey settles into her new life as the protector of the blissfully deracialized world of Athia,

21:10.440 --> 21:12.640
and abandons our world and its problems entirely.

21:12.640 --> 21:13.960
Here's the real kicker though.

21:13.960 --> 21:14.960
The game's awful.

21:14.960 --> 21:15.960
Like, I'd give it a 4 out of 10.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.780
But because it has this wallpaper of black politics.

21:18.780 --> 21:21.800
Because if you only played the first hour of the game, you might think it's highly

21:21.800 --> 21:22.800
politically charged.

21:22.800 --> 21:26.920
There's a lot of retarded progressives online right now who think that if you hate the game,

21:26.920 --> 21:28.480
it has to be because you're a racist.

21:28.480 --> 21:29.480
Can't be any other reason.

21:29.480 --> 21:33.120
Can't be that the game is poorly designed, or ugly, or buggy, or not all that fun to

21:33.120 --> 21:34.120
play.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.720
Because you're a fucking white male.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.720
Even if you're not.

21:37.720 --> 21:38.720
Is the game good?

21:38.720 --> 21:39.720
Yes, the game is good.

21:39.720 --> 21:44.600
Fuck social media, get you the game, is what I'm about to be saying.

21:44.600 --> 21:45.960
That's gonna be the title.

21:45.960 --> 21:49.360
Fuck social media, buy the game, okay?

21:49.360 --> 21:50.360
Because people tripping.

21:50.360 --> 21:54.400
No, I promise you, if you're playing the game, you're not gonna sit here and be like,

21:54.400 --> 21:59.600
oh my god, the dialogue, oh my god, it's so bad, I can't play the game!

21:59.600 --> 22:05.480
Because every three seconds, I see someone on social talking about, they see one clip

22:05.480 --> 22:07.520
and it's like, that's the whole game.

22:07.520 --> 22:08.520
Come on, bro.

22:08.520 --> 22:11.520
Damn it, you just stepped on my throat.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.320
I just kicked a whole deer, bro.

22:13.320 --> 22:15.200
Y'all didn't even see that, for real.

22:15.200 --> 22:21.520
If you haven't actually seen anything other than the one clip from a scene that wasn't

22:21.520 --> 22:23.960
even that cringey, I don't wanna hear about the dialogue.

22:23.960 --> 22:28.000
Like I said, if she looked like any other, anything else, if she looked like anything

22:28.000 --> 22:30.400
else and she said the same scene, no one would bat an eye.

22:30.400 --> 22:31.400
It would be like, what the hell?

22:31.400 --> 22:32.720
It would just be bad writing.

22:32.720 --> 22:36.520
Like, it's not the best writing, but it's not a bad game.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.280
That's what I'm trying to say.

22:38.280 --> 22:39.360
It's not a bad game.

22:39.360 --> 22:40.760
It's like the basic writing.

22:40.760 --> 22:41.760
It could be better.

22:41.760 --> 22:45.120
They probably could have gotten black writers, but they didn't.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.120
That's unfortunate.

22:46.120 --> 22:48.640
But the game's not ass.

22:48.640 --> 22:52.840
Gear and how you heal up and the crafting isn't too much because I hate crafting in

22:52.840 --> 22:55.160
the games and the crafting's not overbearing.

22:55.160 --> 22:58.680
You get like, you can change these nails that give you different powers.

22:58.680 --> 22:59.680
Like, I don't know.

22:59.680 --> 23:00.800
I just, I'm fucking with the game.

23:00.800 --> 23:01.800
It's a good game.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.000
The story is not even horrible.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.240
The story is a story, but I ain't like, damn, this plot is ass.

23:07.240 --> 23:11.120
I'm following it and I don't follow stories that well.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.360
I'm here.

23:12.360 --> 23:15.540
And of course, Prague game developers are out here saying the exact same thing.

23:15.540 --> 23:23.800
Do I think that some of the energy and vitriol and just discussion about this game is happening

23:23.800 --> 23:33.000
because some, but cause it is a lead female black character and it is on a PlayStation

23:33.000 --> 23:34.960
game versus an Xbox game.

23:34.960 --> 23:36.440
Yes, I do.

23:36.440 --> 23:37.440
And then people push back.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.800
Well, I haven't seen anything written like that.

23:39.800 --> 23:40.800
Really?

23:40.800 --> 23:42.040
You can't read between the lines.

23:42.040 --> 23:47.680
So do you ever actually see somebody when they're shitting on game pass go, I don't

23:47.680 --> 23:49.400
really have an issue with game pass.

23:49.400 --> 23:52.480
I just like PlayStation and want Microsoft to lose.

23:52.480 --> 23:56.840
Or when someone's being a misogynist, do they own being a misogynist and say, well, here's

23:56.840 --> 23:58.760
the real fucking deal.

23:58.760 --> 24:01.840
The real fucking deal is a women scare me.

24:01.840 --> 24:02.920
I don't really like them.

24:02.920 --> 24:05.300
I don't trust them and they don't want to fuck me.

24:05.300 --> 24:07.800
That's why I'm really upset about this game.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.540
No one talks like that.

24:09.540 --> 24:10.540
It's called subtext.

24:10.540 --> 24:15.720
So of course you're not seeing people overtly saying I'm not playing for spoken or I'm shitting

24:15.720 --> 24:20.720
on for spoken or I am giving an unjust given the success of what it looks like the game

24:20.720 --> 24:26.280
is going to have amount of time and energy on the internet and in my writing to first

24:26.280 --> 24:29.360
spoken because I'm a racist, they're not going to say that.

24:29.360 --> 24:33.160
Oh, and Bakaki wants you to know if you don't stream for spoken tonight, you're a racist

24:33.160 --> 24:34.160
and a misogynist.

24:34.160 --> 24:35.320
Oh, of course.

24:35.320 --> 24:36.320
Of course.

24:36.320 --> 24:39.440
If you read sarcasm from that clip, I promise you he was being serious.

24:39.440 --> 24:41.060
That's David Scott Jeff.

24:41.060 --> 24:44.280
Of course, the polygon review of the game has to dive into this topic as well.

24:44.280 --> 24:47.020
And outwardly, they appear to have the same take that I do.

24:47.020 --> 24:51.500
Before I wrap up, let's spare a word for Frey, a notionally black protagonist who joins

24:51.500 --> 24:56.040
a growing trend in media of putting black people in worlds where race is inconsequential.

24:56.040 --> 25:00.340
Except the game is very insistent that Frey is a New Yorker, mysterious birth or not,

25:00.340 --> 25:04.240
spending her entire life up until this point growing up in our decidedly non fantasy world

25:04.240 --> 25:06.500
where blackness is not a non factor.

25:06.500 --> 25:10.540
Regrettably, Frey's identity is thinly written and awkwardly deployed as the story leans

25:10.540 --> 25:14.160
not only on stereotypical narratives, but trauma as a plot device.

25:14.200 --> 25:18.200
The complaint here is that the political blackness of the game isn't given enough focus.

25:18.200 --> 25:21.600
Polygon felt bait and switch by that first hour and wanted it everywhere in the game.

25:21.600 --> 25:22.600
I feel the opposite way.

25:22.600 --> 25:23.600
I wanted none of it in the game.

25:23.600 --> 25:27.800
But if they were going to do it, immediately dispensing with it unceremoniously after making

25:27.800 --> 25:30.200
it to Athia is probably the worst way to do it.

25:30.200 --> 25:32.040
It feels like they're cowardly or something.

25:32.040 --> 25:35.200
What they could have done if they really wanted to make a racialized story correctly is have

25:35.200 --> 25:38.520
a different group in Athia, maybe not black Athians, that's two on the nose, make them

25:38.520 --> 25:42.480
a cast or a fantasy race or green people or something who are treated poorly due to their

25:42.480 --> 25:43.480
birth.

25:43.480 --> 25:46.680
And Frey, with her outsider knowledge of race relations on Earth, can shed some light on

25:46.680 --> 25:49.320
the problem from a perspective that Athians never considered.

25:49.320 --> 25:51.420
You could actually make a good story out of that if you tried.

25:51.420 --> 25:52.920
The problem here is no one tried.

25:52.920 --> 25:55.380
Before I get out of here, there's one final thing to talk about.

25:55.380 --> 25:56.380
Hi-Fi Rush.

25:56.380 --> 25:59.900
Hi-Fi Rush is a Bethesda game that looks and plays amazing.

25:59.900 --> 26:03.040
Everything about it, the cel-shaded graphics, the rhythm based combat, the soundtrack, all

26:03.040 --> 26:06.680
scream 2000s to me, which of course I'm a sucker for considering that was the time

26:06.680 --> 26:08.600
period of my high school experience.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.920
People online are comparing Hi-Fi Rush's dialogue to first spoken and fair enough,

26:11.920 --> 26:15.940
and both swamped in millennial writing, jokes during serious moments, fourth wall breaking

26:15.940 --> 26:16.940
stuff, all of it.

26:16.940 --> 26:21.540
But the difference is, forespoken is trying to be a serious fantasy adventure, while simultaneously

26:21.540 --> 26:26.660
being embarrassed of itself, while Hi-Fi Rush is a jokey Saturday morning cartoon that knows

26:26.660 --> 26:27.800
it is a cartoon.

26:27.800 --> 26:31.040
The game is in on the joke and it's endearing, and it also knows not to go too overboard

26:31.040 --> 26:32.040
with it as well.

26:32.040 --> 26:35.200
There's a balance here, Hi-Fi Rush strikes it, forespoken does not.

26:35.200 --> 26:38.560
Hi-Fi Rush and forespoken are being compared on the internet right now because they're

26:38.560 --> 26:42.440
polar opposites occupying the same space, and it's not just because they both feature

26:42.440 --> 26:43.440
millennial writing.

26:43.440 --> 26:47.340
They're the only two notable games to come out during January of 2023.

26:47.340 --> 26:51.000
Forespoken has a build up of multiple years of the Square Enix hype machine behind it,

26:51.000 --> 26:55.180
while Hi-Fi Rush was released the same day it was announced, during a recent Xbox Bethesda

26:55.180 --> 26:58.020
developer conference, with no hype behind it at all.

26:58.020 --> 27:02.120
Forespoken is an open world game, a bland empty sandbox with nothing to do and nobody

27:02.120 --> 27:06.400
interesting in it, while Hi-Fi Rush is a level based hack and slash where each of the environments

27:06.400 --> 27:08.960
and characters appear to be lovingly crafted.

27:08.960 --> 27:13.340
Forespoken launched at 70 US dollars, Sony paid a boatload of money to make it a two

27:13.340 --> 27:18.440
year PS5 console exclusive, and the PC version barely functions unless you've got an amazing

27:18.440 --> 27:22.520
graphics card, while Hi-Fi Rush launched for 30 dollars on Xbox and PC.

27:22.520 --> 27:26.480
You can play it on your shitty 10 year old computer, and you can even play it on Gamepass.

27:26.480 --> 27:30.200
It's no surprise that Hi-Fi Rush basically blew forespoken out of the water in terms

27:30.200 --> 27:31.520
of popularity, is it?

27:31.520 --> 27:35.720
The progs on Twitter are screeching that gamers are all just racist because the cringe writing

27:35.720 --> 27:39.060
in forespoken is identical to Hi-Fi Rush's, but what they don't seem to understand is

27:39.060 --> 27:40.680
that context matters.

27:40.680 --> 27:42.440
Also making a good fucking game matters too.

27:42.440 --> 27:46.080
By the time this video comes out, I have a feeling that the forespoken discourse will

27:46.080 --> 27:49.040
have already been fully washed away by Hi-Fi Rush's success.

27:49.040 --> 27:51.020
I started this script on February 2nd.

27:51.020 --> 27:55.980
The game is so indefensible generic, and people are so tired of being browbeat, that the cries

27:55.980 --> 27:58.840
of racist sexist gamers aren't going to do anything this time.

27:58.840 --> 28:01.920
The game sucks, and that's too bad because there's an okay skeleton in here.

28:01.920 --> 28:04.660
The combat, the movement, and even the skill trees are interesting.

28:04.660 --> 28:07.700
They just needed a totally different game packaged around it.

28:07.700 --> 28:10.920
Which is funny, because Agni's philosophy did in fact look like a totally different

28:10.920 --> 28:11.920
game.

28:11.920 --> 28:15.760
Same art style, same engine, same mechanics, same assets, but totally different characters.

28:15.760 --> 28:19.360
Forespoken really just feels like Square Enix desperately needed to recoup a lot of money.

28:19.360 --> 28:22.800
They had bits and bobs of their games lying around, and they decided to mash it all together

28:22.800 --> 28:27.060
and race swap the protagonist to make her black because Black Lives Matter sells.

28:27.060 --> 28:28.860
Well, it didn't sell enough.

28:28.860 --> 28:31.500
If you're going to get this one, wait for a deep discount, guys.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.960
I'm talking like five to ten dollars.

28:33.960 --> 28:36.000
This one is not fucking worth it.
