00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
Everyone's making a big deal about the Dutch farmer protests online right now.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,120
It's not hard to drop onto social media and see posts like this.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,320
You'll never see this photo of Dutch farmers on your TV.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,160
And to be fair, yeah, it's a pretty striking photo.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,160
You've got the highway lined up with tractors throughout the entire shot.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,160
It's very symmetrical and the colors are pretty good.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,160
This looks like one of those photos that could be considered historic down the line.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,440
Of course, the rightoids are there to push their narrative.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,040
Social media is interviewing people, both farmers who believe that the government ultimately

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,520
wants their land and is using the current legislation as a way to bully them out.

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,800
To former police officers who are more than willing to discuss what will happen if the

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,960
farmer protests continue.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,120
Dutch farmers are saying no to the great reset and climate communism is a pretty good headline

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,500
if you want your post to go viral within rightist circles.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,600
And to their credit, we are seeing arrests of the protesters by the police.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,200
Even one shooting by the police that ended up with one person injured and thankfully

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,200
nobody dead.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,320
This is the right wing's dream come true.

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,160
The whole thing fits into their anti-globalist, Klaus Schwab narrative.

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,720
Here's the TLDR of these protests as I understand them.

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,320
In 2019, the government of the Netherlands announced that their country was in a nitrogen

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,320
emission crisis.

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,220
The Netherlands is the second largest exporter of food in the world after the US.

24
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,200
And this huge amount of food production has led to nitrogen emissions that are destroying

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,640
the very soil the food is grown in, let alone the rest of the environment.

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,520
The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, otherwise known as the

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,040
RIVM, the acronym makes sense in Dutch, released a study showing that 46% of the Netherlands'

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,280
nitrogen emissions come from the agricultural sector, a good chunk of that being from cows.

29
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,500
And so the government intends to put a hard cap on farm emissions.

30
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,360
The farmers in reply said that those numbers were off and that the government has an incentive

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,080
to blame the farmers for the emissions because tackling the actual cause was too hard.

32
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,100
Another large source of nitrogen emissions is power plants and to a lesser extent exhaust

33
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,100
from cars.

34
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,100
At the end of the day, in order to tackle the nitrogen problem, the government was going

35
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,260
to have to take on either the farmers, the car manufacturers or big energy and the government

36
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,320
chose the farmers.

37
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,700
Or alternatively, you could also continue to develop technology that prevents nitrogen

38
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,320
emission or cleans it up afterwards, which Netherlands is already doing because the study

39
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,200
shows a 30% decrease between 2005 and 2018, despite the increased production.

40
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,660
But let's forget about that.

41
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,620
And maybe some rhinoids don't want to admit it, but nitrogen emission is actually a real

42
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,620
problem.

43
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,980
Large parts of the Netherlands are naturally nitrogen-low biomes like bogs that are slowly

44
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,160
getting encroached on by nitrogen-loving forest plants like shrubs and grass.

45
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,620
This change will lead to an extinction of some types of herbs and flowers, which in

46
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,560
turn will lead to an extinction of some types of bugs that feed off of those plants, which

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,980
in turn will lead to an extinction of some types of birds that feed off those bugs.

48
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,020
Nitrogen runoff into the water causes a massive burst of algae growth, which can be toxic

49
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,500
to a lot of local marine life.

50
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,800
The environmental concern isn't exactly fake news here.

51
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,700
These things have a snowballing effect that can absolutely come back to bite us in the

52
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,700
ass in unforeseen ways.

53
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,820
But it's not just nitrogen concerns.

54
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,100
Another large part of it is the rise of animal rights activists in the Netherlands.

55
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,180
Yeah, believe it or not, these hippies have actually managed to get some sway within Dutch

56
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,180
politics.

57
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,500
What ultimately kicked off these protests back in 2019 was 200 of these people illegally

58
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,060
occupying a pig farm.

59
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,940
It was this event that caused the farmers to organize into activist collectives, the

60
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,140
most prominent one being the Farmer Defense Force.

61
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,300
And it's been these organizations that have gathered up these protests on behalf of the

62
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,300
country's farmers.

63
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,980
They're almost like an informal farmers union engaging in a general strike.

64
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,180
The protests have been on and off ever since then.

65
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,460
But in the English speaking world, we're really only hearing about them now because

66
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,940
on June 10, 2022, despite three years of protests and negotiations, the government has ultimately

67
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,940
gone ahead with its plan.

68
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,820
They've designated 24.3 billion euros to the implementation of agricultural reforms

69
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,900
that aim to halve nitrogen emissions by 2030 and close approximately 30% of the farms in

70
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,900
the Netherlands.

71
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,200
These actions have led to all of those viral videos and photos of farmers blocking roads

72
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,360
and the empty store shelves that you see on social media right now.

73
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,160
And the right is all over covering these events while the left is strangely silent.

74
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,800
That's not even pushing back, you know, usually they'll call the right wingers climate deniers

75
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,680
and racists, but this time they're just acting like they don't even know what's happening

76
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
at all.

77
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,680
Maybe they don't.

78
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,000
It's not like they pay attention to what the right is doing.

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,960
But as your local centrist fence sitter, I do actually pay attention to what everyone's

80
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,160
doing as much as I can.

81
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,100
And I'm reminded of a similar situation.

82
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,740
The farmer protests in India, India, like the Netherlands produces more than enough

83
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,040
food to feed its population.

84
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,140
However, unlike the Netherlands, India still faces a hunger problem.

85
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,760
Part of the reason why is because farming isn't as efficient there and neither is

86
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,040
their distribution network.

87
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,800
In 2004, then prime minister of India Manmohan Singh said, we need a second green revolution

88
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,760
making use of modern advances.

89
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,160
For that we need to revitalize India's research agricultural system, India's extension system,

90
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
India's credit system.

91
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,500
The more we commercialize our agriculture, the more our farmers need access to commercial

92
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
inputs.

93
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,940
And that was a modernization of our agriculture credit system.

94
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,740
There are other rigidities because of the whole marketing regime set up in the 1930s,

95
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,180
which prevent our farmers from selling their produce where they get the highest rate of

96
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,180
return.

97
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,860
It is our intention to remove all of these handicaps which come in the way of India realizing

98
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,520
its vast potential as one large common market.

99
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,640
Singh is referring to the Mandy system set up by India's Agricultural Produce Market

100
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
Committee.

101
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,040
Mandys are specialized government run marketplaces where produce is sold via auction and they

102
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,220
are the only place that farmers are allowed to sell their produce in India.

103
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,720
This system was set up first by the colonial government and then continued after India's

104
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,200
independence from the UK because their rulers recognized that India was in a fragile state.

105
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,140
In order to not simply become a consumer nation of other nation's products, government intervention

106
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,360
would be required to protect local production until it got on its feet and was able to compete

107
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,660
in a global marketplace.

108
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,660
The Mandy system continued for nearly 100 years.

109
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,160
In 2020, the current prime minister, Narendra Modi, spoke on the need for India to get rid

110
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,300
of the Mandy system.

111
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,400
His government passed three bills, colloquially known as the Farm Bills.

112
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,980
The first one allowed farmers to sell their produce anywhere.

113
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,980
The second one allowed for contract farming between a farmer and the buyer of his produce.

114
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,800
The third one allowed for the regulation of production in times of extreme need.

115
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,420
In response, throughout late 2020 until November of 2021, there was a massive general strike

116
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,020
by India's farmers who had grown accustomed to the protection that the regulation of the

117
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,020
Mandy system provided them.

118
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,320
Additionally, the farmers also didn't want the government to have the power to regulate

119
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
their production.

120
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,800
Tens of thousands of farmers driving their tractors and riding their horses protested

121
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,400
by blocking highways into and out of Delhi.

122
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,880
Police arrested the protesters.

123
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,140
Protesters broke through barricades.

124
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,160
Police and the farmers clashed, leading to many injuries and deaths.

125
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,400
This continued for months until, in November of 2021, Modi repealed the three Farm Bills.

126
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,200
While this was happening, I don't recall seeing many right-leaning people talking about

127
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
it.

128
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
But the left?

129
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,760
Oh man, every breadtuber, every shitty Prague streamer, every terminally-online verified

130
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,040
account was talking about this, about how this was the socialist praxis in action, how

131
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,960
the working class was rising up against the bourgeoisie in India, despite none of them

132
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,160
knowing a single fucking thing that was going on or anything about India's politics.

133
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,200
It's not hard to see the parallels, though, is it?

134
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,320
In both cases, the government decided to fuck with farmers.

135
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,220
The farmers organized and unionized and engaged in a general strike, stopping not only their

136
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,840
own production but shutting down other segments of society because their demands were not

137
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
being met.

138
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,700
And the English-speaking world, foreign to both events, only had something to say about

139
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,140
it when it fit their specific narrative.

140
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,480
Rightoids ignored the India protests, just like the leftoids are ignoring the Dutch protests.

141
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,140
And it's because Prime Minister Modi is the leader of India's right-wing party while

142
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,700
the Dutch farmers are protesting a left-wing government.

143
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,780
To be clear, I'm not only saying that people are specifically ignoring it for partisan

144
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,660
reasons, I'm sure that happens but it's not the only factor, I'm also saying that

145
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,060
if you don't have an ideological predisposition to support the protests, they're not even

146
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,640
going to hit your social media feed.

147
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,420
This is just a hunch, but I bet a lot of right-leaning people probably never even heard a peep about

148
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,660
the India protests, it just never hit their radar, and the same thing is probably happening

149
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,660
to left-leaning people right now over the Netherlands.

150
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,180
Also, if you want another parallel, it's funny as fuck that in both instances the government

151
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,820
was labelled as fascist, in India because of Modi's unapologetically pro-India stance,

152
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,180
and in the Netherlands because of the government's seeming desire to turn his workforce into

153
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,180
serfs.

154
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,180
There's a wider trend here, though.

155
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,980
For example, here in Canada, Trudeau has quietly announced that his government wants to pursue

156
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,780
the same policies as in the Netherlands, and farmers are already preparing to protest.

157
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,300
Farmers already took part in the blockade as part of the Ottawa trucker protest, yes

158
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,820
that's still coming, which was another working class general strike against government action.

159
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,820
A couple of online socialists who still retain a few brain cells, like Shue for example,

160
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,620
was dismayed at the broader left's reaction to the trucker protest, saying,

161
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,100
Do leftists cheering this on understand that Canada isn't freezing the bank accounts

162
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,040
of protesters because they're fascists or whatever, but that they are freezing them

163
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,420
because the convoy is now threatening capital?

164
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,740
What do you think a general strike would be like?

165
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
And Shue was correct.

166
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,660
For all of the socialist bluster about the proletariat's revolt, when it actually happens,

167
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,900
the socialists scream about how the truckers and the farmers aren't actually the proletariat.

168
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,920
The revolt of the workers was actually a fascist insurrection against them, and that they needed

169
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,560
to be at the least dispersed and better yet forced back to work, producing the goods and

170
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,680
services that the left requires of them.

171
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,120
Another event going viral right now is the massive protests in the Democratic Socialist

172
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,360
Republic of Sri Lanka, with dramatic footage of the presidential palace being stormed January

173
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,360
6th style.

174
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,680
And yes, it is real socialism, all you have to do is examine their economic policies recently.

175
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,240
Since 2010, Sri Lanka has taken on enormous amounts of debt, primarily from China.

176
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,060
The government tried to spend its way out of the crisis, and did so by cutting taxes

177
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,520
and printing a shit ton of money.

178
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,120
And this, it directly ignored the advice of the IMF, the International Monetary Fund.

179
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,700
You know, that thing that socialists claim is the arm of neoliberal colonialism that

180
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,280
rolls into the third world and liberalizes their economies and turns them into capitalist

181
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
surf states?

182
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,080
Well, that same IMF advised Sri Lanka to stop printing so much money.

183
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,280
Sri Lanka said, fuck you, I'm socialist, I'll do what I want, and then they basically destroyed

184
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,280
their economy.

185
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,880
But more interesting for the purposes of this video is that Sri Lanka also banned non-organic

186
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,200
farming, and in doing so also banned most types of fertilizer.

187
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,040
There was an instant loss of tea production, costing the country 425 million dollars.

188
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,200
Within six months, the country was producing 20% less rice, and transitioned from being

189
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,620
self-sufficient in food production to having to import food at a cost of 450 million dollars.

190
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,640
As expected, the farmers started to revolt and organize, you've heard this story before.

191
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,480
Government's response was to simply print more money and pay the farmers off with it,

192
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,960
which didn't exactly work.

193
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,280
So the question remains, what is it with governments trying to fuck with farmers?

194
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,160
Maybe governments just innately fear them.

195
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,360
There is that old saying that every society is a few weeks away from collapse or something,

196
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,040
referencing the fact that if food stops making it from farm to store at a table, no amount

197
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,520
of bribery or force will keep a population from overthrowing its government, or die trying.

198
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,960
Though maybe it's something a little bit deeper than that.

199
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,900
We all know about the kulaks at this point, don't we?

200
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,920
Well here's the story anyway, for completionist's sake.

201
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,880
In the Soviet Union, Russian farmers were divided into three classes.

202
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,140
Benyaks, the poor peasants, Srednyaks, the medium income peasants, and kulaks, the high

203
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,140
income peasants.

204
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,660
By high income, the socialists meant that the farmers had at least eight acres of land.

205
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,620
Just so you can visualize it, one acre is just under half of a baseball field.

206
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,780
So if you had four baseball fields worth of land, you were a high income peasant by Soviet

207
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,780
standards.

208
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,340
During the final years of the Russian empire, the Stulpin reform was implemented.

209
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:40,020
This was a liberalization of the Russian agricultural economy, where peasants were able to gradually

210
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,700
come to own their own farms by paying off the old noble landowner class, which they

211
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,180
were once serfs of, using a monthly portion of their farm earnings.

212
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,300
Though there were differences in quality of land, it's generally recognized as historical

213
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,820
fact that the Stulpin system allowed for harder working farmers to acquire more land over

214
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,500
time, making it somewhat of a meritocratic system.

215
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,800
By the time of the communist revolution, the most successful of the Russian farmers under

216
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,860
the Stulpin system were considered the kulaks, and were labeled as class traitors by the

217
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,860
government.

218
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,620
In everyday Stalinism, ordinary life in extraordinary times, Sheila Fitzpatrick wrote that the Soviet

219
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,340
regime was adept at creating its own enemies, whom it then suspected of conspiracy against

220
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,340
the state.

221
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,820
He wrote that he would go first by declaring that all members of certain social classes

222
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,300
and estates, primarily former nobles, members of the bourgeoisie, priests, and kulaks, were

223
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,120
by definition class enemies, resentful of their loss of privilege, and likely to engage

224
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,420
in counter-revolutionary conspiracy to recover them.

225
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,420
Fitzpatrick came to this conclusion primarily through Lenin's own words, who said in a

226
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,140
speech in August of 1918,

227
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,500
The kulaks are rabid foes of the Soviet government.

228
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Either the kulaks massacre a vast number of workers, or the workers ruthlessly suppress

229
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,340
the revolts of the predatory kulak minority of the people against the working people's

230
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,340
government.

231
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,580
There can be no middle course.

232
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,780
Peace is out of the question.

233
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,100
Even if they have quarreled, the kulak can easily come to terms with the landowner, the

234
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,100
czar, and the priest.

235
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,740
But with the working class, never.

236
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,580
The class-conscious workers' program is the closest alliance and complete unity with

237
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,760
the poor peasants, concessions to and agreement with the middle peasants, and ruthless suppression

238
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,140
of the kulaks, those bloodsuckers, vampires, plunderers of the people, and profiteers who

239
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,360
batten on famine.

240
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,840
Robert Conquest's book of the dekulakization of Ukraine, The Harvest of Sorrow, details

241
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,360
that during this summer of 1918, the Red Army poured out of the cities and into the countryside

242
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,240
in order to begin the collectivization process of all the farmland, and began to seize grain

243
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,040
for transport into the urban centers.

244
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,760
Conquest wrote, the land of the landlords had been spontaneously seized by the peasants

245
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,480
in 1917-18.

246
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,960
A small class of richer peasants with around 50-80 acres had then been expropriated by

247
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
the Bolsheviks.

248
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,840
Far after, a Marxist conception of class struggle led to an almost totally imaginary class categorization

249
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,040
being inflicted in the villages, where peasants with a couple of cows or five or six acres

250
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,160
more than their neighbors were now being labeled as kulaks, and a class war against them was

251
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,360
being declared.

252
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,440
Who was actually a kulak was not based on any sort of subjective criteria, despite the

253
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,560
government's efforts.

254
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,240
In essence, you were a kulak based on the arbitrary conception of whatever red guard

255
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,420
you happened to bump into who thought you might have too much stuff, and if somebody

256
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,180
in your village hated you, all they had to do was tell a red guard that you were a kulak.

257
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,180
This resulted in a large-scale revolt against Soviet rule, in response to which Lenin's

258
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:17,000
famous hanging order was declared, hang without fail so the people see no fewer than one hundred

259
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,680
known kulaks, rich men, bloodsuckers, do it in such a way that for hundreds of kilometers

260
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,180
around the people will see, tremble, know, shout, they are strangling and will strangle

261
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,440
to death the bloodsucker kulaks.

262
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,320
By 1929, collectivization was well underway.

263
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,320
By this point, anyone who had used hired labor, owned a mill, owned a creamery, owned

264
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,920
other equivalent farm processing equipment, owned any complex machine with a motor, or

265
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,280
who had rented any such facility or machine, or who had traded their produce, lent their

266
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,640
money, or engaged in any other form of non-labor income was considered a kulak by the government.

267
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,620
Stalin finally ordered the liquidation of the kulaks as a class.

268
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,400
This actually didn't initially mean killing them, but instead seizing their land and their

269
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,520
produce, dispersing them from their organizations and ties with each other, and as isolated

270
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,760
individuals folding them into the collectivized farm system.

271
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,120
In response to this, the kulaks destroyed their own farms and butchered all of their

272
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,640
livestock rather than letting them fall into Soviet hands.

273
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,800
They did manage to eat or trade some of their produce, but a lot of it was simply lost.

274
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,080
It was at this point that Stalin actually had them purged.

275
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,920
Without the kulaks and their produce, the Soviet agricultural sector lacked both the

276
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,160
expertise and the materials necessary to create food, leading to the Soviet famine of 1932-33.

277
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,640
The Red Army during this famine plundered the Ukrainian countryside to keep the Russian

278
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,200
cities fed, leading to what is considered a genocide of the Ukrainian people.

279
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,500
In my opinion, the reason that this always seems to happen to farmers isn't solely because

280
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,880
the government's stability relies on them bringing food to market, though that's part

281
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,360
of it, but it's also because the farmers, at least partially, exist outside of a system

282
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,360
of government control.

283
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,400
Yes, there are farm subsidies.

284
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,620
Governments do like to buy the loyalty of farmers, but that's about the only lever of

285
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,080
power that they actually have.

286
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,960
Imagine you're a bug-eating, pod-dwelling, soy-sipping city worker.

287
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,320
Your lifestyle requires that the supply chain keep bringing food into the city.

288
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,920
No farms, no food, and you can't live the way that you do.

289
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,000
Now imagine that you're living in a mining town or a wood mill town.

290
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,920
Some other form of production that is important, some other way of living that is not a city,

291
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,280
but it's still not related to food.

292
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,640
Even though you're doing meaningful labor, you still ultimately rely on the local farm

293
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
to feed you.

294
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,880
You simply trade your labor for theirs.

295
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,880
In both cases, the government can tweak your behavior through incentives by managing the

296
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
supply chain.

297
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,240
That can't be done with farmers.

298
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,080
You can't withhold food from people who produce it, unless you're willing to point

299
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,560
guns at them like the Soviets did.

300
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,920
And we saw how that ended up.

301
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,280
This is one of the great contradictions of socialism.

302
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,400
You will often hear these two talking points come out of the mouth of any socialist.

303
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
1.

304
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
The workers should own their own labor.

305
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
2.

306
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
That food is a human right.

307
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,160
These are mutually exclusive.

308
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
Farmers are workers.

309
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,240
If a farmer owns his labor, then he owns the food it produces.

310
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,660
That's his tools, his materials, his capital, his labor.

311
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,020
So the product of it, the food, that's his too.

312
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,780
But if food is a human right, then the farmer does not actually own his labor, the people

313
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,780
do.

314
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,360
The people have a right to the farmer's food, the farmer's labor.

315
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,900
And for him to exert his own ownership, he necessarily has to violate the rights of other

316
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,000
people under any socialist framework.

317
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,140
When these two statements come into conflict, and they always do, time and again, the socialist

318
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,820
rejects the worker should own his labor for food is a human right.

319
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,500
The Soviets did not consider the kulaks to own their own labor.

320
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,860
Instead, the people owned it.

321
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,780
And that sentiment is expressed in modern times, thankfully without the backing of state

322
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,780
force.

323
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,740
They claim that farmers or truckers should not be allowed to protest and that instead

324
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,300
have to get back to work to keep producing the products that the cities have a right

325
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,300
to.

326
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,700
But it's all sleight of hand in the end.

327
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,560
If you find that rare, honest socialist, he will tell you that a worker doesn't really

328
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,940
have a right to his own labor under their system, rather that workers as a class have

329
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,760
a right to their collective labor.

330
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,200
Under a socialist framework, you as an individual don't have the right to exclusively own your

331
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,140
own labor, as in you and only you own it.

332
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,940
There is no standing apart from the collective in their system.

333
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,460
Only workers as a class have a right to their labor, which means that workers of a class

334
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,100
have a right to your labor.

335
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,780
And if you deny other people your labor, you are violating their rights.

336
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,100
Even for all the faults with the India example that I talked about earlier, the fact that

337
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,380
Modi was right-leaning at least led him to attempt to liberalize rather than socialize

338
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,520
his market and also led him to ultimately back down when he figured out that his reforms

339
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
were deeply unpopular.

340
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,900
Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, this has been going on for three years, mismanagement in

341
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,740
Sri Lanka for over ten, and the Soviets created one of the great bloodbaths of human history.

342
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,620
All because of the natural human impulse of productive people to individually, exclusively

343
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:29,840
own and control that which they create, and how centralized systems of power tend not

344
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,960
to be able to tolerate this individualistic impulse.

345
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,420
The reason the left hates working-class protests like these farmer strikes is because it puts

346
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:41,300
on display for all to see the hypocrisy and subversion of socialism.
