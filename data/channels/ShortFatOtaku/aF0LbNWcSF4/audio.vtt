00:00.000 --> 00:09.120
Everyone's making a big deal about the Dutch farmer protests online right now.

00:09.120 --> 00:12.120
It's not hard to drop onto social media and see posts like this.

00:12.120 --> 00:15.320
You'll never see this photo of Dutch farmers on your TV.

00:15.320 --> 00:17.160
And to be fair, yeah, it's a pretty striking photo.

00:17.160 --> 00:20.160
You've got the highway lined up with tractors throughout the entire shot.

00:20.160 --> 00:22.160
It's very symmetrical and the colors are pretty good.

00:22.160 --> 00:25.160
This looks like one of those photos that could be considered historic down the line.

00:25.160 --> 00:27.440
Of course, the rightoids are there to push their narrative.

00:27.440 --> 00:31.040
Social media is interviewing people, both farmers who believe that the government ultimately

00:31.040 --> 00:34.520
wants their land and is using the current legislation as a way to bully them out.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.800
To former police officers who are more than willing to discuss what will happen if the

00:37.800 --> 00:38.960
farmer protests continue.

00:38.960 --> 00:44.120
Dutch farmers are saying no to the great reset and climate communism is a pretty good headline

00:44.120 --> 00:47.500
if you want your post to go viral within rightist circles.

00:47.500 --> 00:51.600
And to their credit, we are seeing arrests of the protesters by the police.

00:51.600 --> 00:55.200
Even one shooting by the police that ended up with one person injured and thankfully

00:55.200 --> 00:56.200
nobody dead.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.320
This is the right wing's dream come true.

00:58.320 --> 01:02.160
The whole thing fits into their anti-globalist, Klaus Schwab narrative.

01:02.160 --> 01:04.720
Here's the TLDR of these protests as I understand them.

01:04.720 --> 01:08.320
In 2019, the government of the Netherlands announced that their country was in a nitrogen

01:08.320 --> 01:09.320
emission crisis.

01:09.320 --> 01:13.220
The Netherlands is the second largest exporter of food in the world after the US.

01:13.220 --> 01:17.200
And this huge amount of food production has led to nitrogen emissions that are destroying

01:17.200 --> 01:20.640
the very soil the food is grown in, let alone the rest of the environment.

01:20.640 --> 01:24.520
The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, otherwise known as the

01:24.520 --> 01:30.040
RIVM, the acronym makes sense in Dutch, released a study showing that 46% of the Netherlands'

01:30.040 --> 01:34.280
nitrogen emissions come from the agricultural sector, a good chunk of that being from cows.

01:34.280 --> 01:37.500
And so the government intends to put a hard cap on farm emissions.

01:37.500 --> 01:41.360
The farmers in reply said that those numbers were off and that the government has an incentive

01:41.360 --> 01:46.080
to blame the farmers for the emissions because tackling the actual cause was too hard.

01:46.080 --> 01:50.100
Another large source of nitrogen emissions is power plants and to a lesser extent exhaust

01:50.100 --> 01:51.100
from cars.

01:51.100 --> 01:54.100
At the end of the day, in order to tackle the nitrogen problem, the government was going

01:54.180 --> 01:58.260
to have to take on either the farmers, the car manufacturers or big energy and the government

01:58.260 --> 01:59.320
chose the farmers.

01:59.320 --> 02:03.700
Or alternatively, you could also continue to develop technology that prevents nitrogen

02:03.700 --> 02:07.320
emission or cleans it up afterwards, which Netherlands is already doing because the study

02:07.320 --> 02:12.200
shows a 30% decrease between 2005 and 2018, despite the increased production.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.660
But let's forget about that.

02:13.660 --> 02:17.620
And maybe some rhinoids don't want to admit it, but nitrogen emission is actually a real

02:17.620 --> 02:18.620
problem.

02:18.620 --> 02:22.980
Large parts of the Netherlands are naturally nitrogen-low biomes like bogs that are slowly

02:22.980 --> 02:27.160
getting encroached on by nitrogen-loving forest plants like shrubs and grass.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.620
This change will lead to an extinction of some types of herbs and flowers, which in

02:30.620 --> 02:34.560
turn will lead to an extinction of some types of bugs that feed off of those plants, which

02:34.560 --> 02:38.980
in turn will lead to an extinction of some types of birds that feed off those bugs.

02:38.980 --> 02:43.020
Nitrogen runoff into the water causes a massive burst of algae growth, which can be toxic

02:43.020 --> 02:44.500
to a lot of local marine life.

02:44.500 --> 02:46.800
The environmental concern isn't exactly fake news here.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.700
These things have a snowballing effect that can absolutely come back to bite us in the

02:49.700 --> 02:50.700
ass in unforeseen ways.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.820
But it's not just nitrogen concerns.

02:52.860 --> 02:56.100
Another large part of it is the rise of animal rights activists in the Netherlands.

02:56.100 --> 03:00.180
Yeah, believe it or not, these hippies have actually managed to get some sway within Dutch

03:00.180 --> 03:01.180
politics.

03:01.180 --> 03:05.500
What ultimately kicked off these protests back in 2019 was 200 of these people illegally

03:05.500 --> 03:07.060
occupying a pig farm.

03:07.060 --> 03:10.940
It was this event that caused the farmers to organize into activist collectives, the

03:10.940 --> 03:13.140
most prominent one being the Farmer Defense Force.

03:13.140 --> 03:17.300
And it's been these organizations that have gathered up these protests on behalf of the

03:17.300 --> 03:18.300
country's farmers.

03:18.300 --> 03:21.980
They're almost like an informal farmers union engaging in a general strike.

03:21.980 --> 03:24.180
The protests have been on and off ever since then.

03:24.180 --> 03:27.460
But in the English speaking world, we're really only hearing about them now because

03:27.460 --> 03:32.940
on June 10, 2022, despite three years of protests and negotiations, the government has ultimately

03:32.940 --> 03:33.940
gone ahead with its plan.

03:33.940 --> 03:38.820
They've designated 24.3 billion euros to the implementation of agricultural reforms

03:38.820 --> 03:43.900
that aim to halve nitrogen emissions by 2030 and close approximately 30% of the farms in

03:43.900 --> 03:44.900
the Netherlands.

03:44.900 --> 03:49.200
These actions have led to all of those viral videos and photos of farmers blocking roads

03:49.200 --> 03:52.360
and the empty store shelves that you see on social media right now.

03:52.360 --> 03:56.160
And the right is all over covering these events while the left is strangely silent.

03:56.160 --> 03:59.800
That's not even pushing back, you know, usually they'll call the right wingers climate deniers

03:59.800 --> 04:02.680
and racists, but this time they're just acting like they don't even know what's happening

04:02.680 --> 04:03.680
at all.

04:03.680 --> 04:04.680
Maybe they don't.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.000
It's not like they pay attention to what the right is doing.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.960
But as your local centrist fence sitter, I do actually pay attention to what everyone's

04:09.960 --> 04:11.160
doing as much as I can.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.100
And I'm reminded of a similar situation.

04:13.100 --> 04:16.740
The farmer protests in India, India, like the Netherlands produces more than enough

04:16.740 --> 04:18.040
food to feed its population.

04:18.040 --> 04:21.140
However, unlike the Netherlands, India still faces a hunger problem.

04:21.140 --> 04:24.760
Part of the reason why is because farming isn't as efficient there and neither is

04:24.760 --> 04:26.040
their distribution network.

04:26.040 --> 04:31.800
In 2004, then prime minister of India Manmohan Singh said, we need a second green revolution

04:31.800 --> 04:33.760
making use of modern advances.

04:33.760 --> 04:38.160
For that we need to revitalize India's research agricultural system, India's extension system,

04:38.160 --> 04:39.160
India's credit system.

04:39.160 --> 04:42.500
The more we commercialize our agriculture, the more our farmers need access to commercial

04:42.500 --> 04:43.500
inputs.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.940
And that was a modernization of our agriculture credit system.

04:45.940 --> 04:49.740
There are other rigidities because of the whole marketing regime set up in the 1930s,

04:49.740 --> 04:53.180
which prevent our farmers from selling their produce where they get the highest rate of

04:53.180 --> 04:54.180
return.

04:54.180 --> 04:57.860
It is our intention to remove all of these handicaps which come in the way of India realizing

04:57.860 --> 05:00.520
its vast potential as one large common market.

05:00.520 --> 05:04.640
Singh is referring to the Mandy system set up by India's Agricultural Produce Market

05:04.640 --> 05:05.640
Committee.

05:05.640 --> 05:10.040
Mandys are specialized government run marketplaces where produce is sold via auction and they

05:10.040 --> 05:13.220
are the only place that farmers are allowed to sell their produce in India.

05:13.220 --> 05:16.720
This system was set up first by the colonial government and then continued after India's

05:16.720 --> 05:21.200
independence from the UK because their rulers recognized that India was in a fragile state.

05:21.200 --> 05:25.140
In order to not simply become a consumer nation of other nation's products, government intervention

05:25.140 --> 05:29.360
would be required to protect local production until it got on its feet and was able to compete

05:29.360 --> 05:30.660
in a global marketplace.

05:30.660 --> 05:33.660
The Mandy system continued for nearly 100 years.

05:33.660 --> 05:38.160
In 2020, the current prime minister, Narendra Modi, spoke on the need for India to get rid

05:38.160 --> 05:39.300
of the Mandy system.

05:39.300 --> 05:42.400
His government passed three bills, colloquially known as the Farm Bills.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.980
The first one allowed farmers to sell their produce anywhere.

05:44.980 --> 05:48.980
The second one allowed for contract farming between a farmer and the buyer of his produce.

05:48.980 --> 05:52.800
The third one allowed for the regulation of production in times of extreme need.

05:52.800 --> 05:57.420
In response, throughout late 2020 until November of 2021, there was a massive general strike

05:57.420 --> 06:01.020
by India's farmers who had grown accustomed to the protection that the regulation of the

06:01.020 --> 06:02.020
Mandy system provided them.

06:02.020 --> 06:05.320
Additionally, the farmers also didn't want the government to have the power to regulate

06:05.320 --> 06:06.320
their production.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.800
Tens of thousands of farmers driving their tractors and riding their horses protested

06:09.800 --> 06:12.400
by blocking highways into and out of Delhi.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.880
Police arrested the protesters.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.140
Protesters broke through barricades.

06:15.140 --> 06:18.160
Police and the farmers clashed, leading to many injuries and deaths.

06:18.160 --> 06:22.400
This continued for months until, in November of 2021, Modi repealed the three Farm Bills.

06:22.400 --> 06:26.200
While this was happening, I don't recall seeing many right-leaning people talking about

06:26.200 --> 06:27.200
it.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.200
But the left?

06:28.200 --> 06:31.760
Oh man, every breadtuber, every shitty Prague streamer, every terminally-online verified

06:31.760 --> 06:35.040
account was talking about this, about how this was the socialist praxis in action, how

06:35.040 --> 06:37.960
the working class was rising up against the bourgeoisie in India, despite none of them

06:37.960 --> 06:41.160
knowing a single fucking thing that was going on or anything about India's politics.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.200
It's not hard to see the parallels, though, is it?

06:43.200 --> 06:45.320
In both cases, the government decided to fuck with farmers.

06:45.320 --> 06:49.220
The farmers organized and unionized and engaged in a general strike, stopping not only their

06:49.220 --> 06:52.840
own production but shutting down other segments of society because their demands were not

06:52.840 --> 06:53.840
being met.

06:53.840 --> 06:57.700
And the English-speaking world, foreign to both events, only had something to say about

06:57.700 --> 07:00.140
it when it fit their specific narrative.

07:00.140 --> 07:03.480
Rightoids ignored the India protests, just like the leftoids are ignoring the Dutch protests.

07:03.480 --> 07:07.140
And it's because Prime Minister Modi is the leader of India's right-wing party while

07:07.140 --> 07:09.700
the Dutch farmers are protesting a left-wing government.

07:09.700 --> 07:12.780
To be clear, I'm not only saying that people are specifically ignoring it for partisan

07:12.780 --> 07:15.660
reasons, I'm sure that happens but it's not the only factor, I'm also saying that

07:15.660 --> 07:20.060
if you don't have an ideological predisposition to support the protests, they're not even

07:20.060 --> 07:21.640
going to hit your social media feed.

07:21.640 --> 07:25.420
This is just a hunch, but I bet a lot of right-leaning people probably never even heard a peep about

07:25.420 --> 07:28.660
the India protests, it just never hit their radar, and the same thing is probably happening

07:28.660 --> 07:30.660
to left-leaning people right now over the Netherlands.

07:30.660 --> 07:34.180
Also, if you want another parallel, it's funny as fuck that in both instances the government

07:34.180 --> 07:38.820
was labelled as fascist, in India because of Modi's unapologetically pro-India stance,

07:38.820 --> 07:42.180
and in the Netherlands because of the government's seeming desire to turn his workforce into

07:42.180 --> 07:43.180
serfs.

07:43.180 --> 07:44.180
There's a wider trend here, though.

07:44.180 --> 07:47.980
For example, here in Canada, Trudeau has quietly announced that his government wants to pursue

07:47.980 --> 07:51.780
the same policies as in the Netherlands, and farmers are already preparing to protest.

07:51.780 --> 07:55.300
Farmers already took part in the blockade as part of the Ottawa trucker protest, yes

07:55.300 --> 07:58.820
that's still coming, which was another working class general strike against government action.

07:58.820 --> 08:02.820
A couple of online socialists who still retain a few brain cells, like Shue for example,

08:02.820 --> 08:06.620
was dismayed at the broader left's reaction to the trucker protest, saying,

08:06.620 --> 08:10.100
Do leftists cheering this on understand that Canada isn't freezing the bank accounts

08:10.100 --> 08:13.040
of protesters because they're fascists or whatever, but that they are freezing them

08:13.040 --> 08:15.420
because the convoy is now threatening capital?

08:15.420 --> 08:17.740
What do you think a general strike would be like?

08:17.740 --> 08:18.740
And Shue was correct.

08:18.740 --> 08:22.660
For all of the socialist bluster about the proletariat's revolt, when it actually happens,

08:22.660 --> 08:25.900
the socialists scream about how the truckers and the farmers aren't actually the proletariat.

08:25.900 --> 08:29.920
The revolt of the workers was actually a fascist insurrection against them, and that they needed

08:29.920 --> 08:34.560
to be at the least dispersed and better yet forced back to work, producing the goods and

08:34.560 --> 08:36.680
services that the left requires of them.

08:36.680 --> 08:40.120
Another event going viral right now is the massive protests in the Democratic Socialist

08:40.120 --> 08:44.360
Republic of Sri Lanka, with dramatic footage of the presidential palace being stormed January

08:44.360 --> 08:45.360
6th style.

08:45.360 --> 08:48.680
And yes, it is real socialism, all you have to do is examine their economic policies recently.

08:48.680 --> 08:52.240
Since 2010, Sri Lanka has taken on enormous amounts of debt, primarily from China.

08:52.240 --> 08:56.060
The government tried to spend its way out of the crisis, and did so by cutting taxes

08:56.060 --> 08:57.520
and printing a shit ton of money.

08:57.520 --> 09:01.120
And this, it directly ignored the advice of the IMF, the International Monetary Fund.

09:01.120 --> 09:04.700
You know, that thing that socialists claim is the arm of neoliberal colonialism that

09:04.700 --> 09:08.280
rolls into the third world and liberalizes their economies and turns them into capitalist

09:08.280 --> 09:09.280
surf states?

09:09.280 --> 09:13.080
Well, that same IMF advised Sri Lanka to stop printing so much money.

09:13.080 --> 09:16.280
Sri Lanka said, fuck you, I'm socialist, I'll do what I want, and then they basically destroyed

09:16.280 --> 09:17.280
their economy.

09:17.280 --> 09:21.880
But more interesting for the purposes of this video is that Sri Lanka also banned non-organic

09:21.880 --> 09:25.200
farming, and in doing so also banned most types of fertilizer.

09:25.200 --> 09:30.040
There was an instant loss of tea production, costing the country 425 million dollars.

09:30.040 --> 09:34.200
Within six months, the country was producing 20% less rice, and transitioned from being

09:34.200 --> 09:39.620
self-sufficient in food production to having to import food at a cost of 450 million dollars.

09:39.620 --> 09:43.640
As expected, the farmers started to revolt and organize, you've heard this story before.

09:43.640 --> 09:47.480
Government's response was to simply print more money and pay the farmers off with it,

09:47.480 --> 09:48.960
which didn't exactly work.

09:48.960 --> 09:52.280
So the question remains, what is it with governments trying to fuck with farmers?

09:52.280 --> 09:54.160
Maybe governments just innately fear them.

09:54.200 --> 09:57.360
There is that old saying that every society is a few weeks away from collapse or something,

09:57.360 --> 10:01.040
referencing the fact that if food stops making it from farm to store at a table, no amount

10:01.040 --> 10:05.520
of bribery or force will keep a population from overthrowing its government, or die trying.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.960
Though maybe it's something a little bit deeper than that.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.900
We all know about the kulaks at this point, don't we?

10:10.900 --> 10:12.920
Well here's the story anyway, for completionist's sake.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.880
In the Soviet Union, Russian farmers were divided into three classes.

10:15.880 --> 10:20.140
Benyaks, the poor peasants, Srednyaks, the medium income peasants, and kulaks, the high

10:20.140 --> 10:21.140
income peasants.

10:21.140 --> 10:24.660
By high income, the socialists meant that the farmers had at least eight acres of land.

10:24.660 --> 10:27.620
Just so you can visualize it, one acre is just under half of a baseball field.

10:27.620 --> 10:31.780
So if you had four baseball fields worth of land, you were a high income peasant by Soviet

10:31.780 --> 10:32.780
standards.

10:32.780 --> 10:36.340
During the final years of the Russian empire, the Stulpin reform was implemented.

10:36.340 --> 10:40.020
This was a liberalization of the Russian agricultural economy, where peasants were able to gradually

10:40.020 --> 10:44.700
come to own their own farms by paying off the old noble landowner class, which they

10:44.700 --> 10:48.180
were once serfs of, using a monthly portion of their farm earnings.

10:48.180 --> 10:52.300
Though there were differences in quality of land, it's generally recognized as historical

10:52.300 --> 10:56.820
fact that the Stulpin system allowed for harder working farmers to acquire more land over

10:56.820 --> 10:59.500
time, making it somewhat of a meritocratic system.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.800
By the time of the communist revolution, the most successful of the Russian farmers under

11:02.800 --> 11:06.860
the Stulpin system were considered the kulaks, and were labeled as class traitors by the

11:06.860 --> 11:07.860
government.

11:07.860 --> 11:12.620
In everyday Stalinism, ordinary life in extraordinary times, Sheila Fitzpatrick wrote that the Soviet

11:12.620 --> 11:16.340
regime was adept at creating its own enemies, whom it then suspected of conspiracy against

11:16.340 --> 11:17.340
the state.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.820
He wrote that he would go first by declaring that all members of certain social classes

11:19.820 --> 11:24.300
and estates, primarily former nobles, members of the bourgeoisie, priests, and kulaks, were

11:24.300 --> 11:29.120
by definition class enemies, resentful of their loss of privilege, and likely to engage

11:29.120 --> 11:31.420
in counter-revolutionary conspiracy to recover them.

11:31.420 --> 11:35.420
Fitzpatrick came to this conclusion primarily through Lenin's own words, who said in a

11:35.420 --> 11:37.140
speech in August of 1918,

11:37.140 --> 11:39.500
The kulaks are rabid foes of the Soviet government.

11:39.500 --> 11:43.500
Either the kulaks massacre a vast number of workers, or the workers ruthlessly suppress

11:43.500 --> 11:47.340
the revolts of the predatory kulak minority of the people against the working people's

11:47.340 --> 11:48.340
government.

11:48.340 --> 11:49.580
There can be no middle course.

11:49.580 --> 11:50.780
Peace is out of the question.

11:50.780 --> 11:54.100
Even if they have quarreled, the kulak can easily come to terms with the landowner, the

11:54.100 --> 11:55.100
czar, and the priest.

11:55.100 --> 11:56.740
But with the working class, never.

11:56.740 --> 12:00.580
The class-conscious workers' program is the closest alliance and complete unity with

12:00.580 --> 12:04.760
the poor peasants, concessions to and agreement with the middle peasants, and ruthless suppression

12:04.760 --> 12:09.140
of the kulaks, those bloodsuckers, vampires, plunderers of the people, and profiteers who

12:09.140 --> 12:10.360
batten on famine.

12:10.360 --> 12:14.840
Robert Conquest's book of the dekulakization of Ukraine, The Harvest of Sorrow, details

12:14.840 --> 12:19.360
that during this summer of 1918, the Red Army poured out of the cities and into the countryside

12:19.360 --> 12:23.240
in order to begin the collectivization process of all the farmland, and began to seize grain

12:23.240 --> 12:25.040
for transport into the urban centers.

12:25.040 --> 12:28.760
Conquest wrote, the land of the landlords had been spontaneously seized by the peasants

12:28.760 --> 12:30.480
in 1917-18.

12:30.480 --> 12:34.960
A small class of richer peasants with around 50-80 acres had then been expropriated by

12:34.960 --> 12:35.960
the Bolsheviks.

12:35.960 --> 12:41.840
Far after, a Marxist conception of class struggle led to an almost totally imaginary class categorization

12:41.840 --> 12:46.040
being inflicted in the villages, where peasants with a couple of cows or five or six acres

12:46.040 --> 12:50.160
more than their neighbors were now being labeled as kulaks, and a class war against them was

12:50.160 --> 12:51.360
being declared.

12:51.360 --> 12:55.440
Who was actually a kulak was not based on any sort of subjective criteria, despite the

12:55.440 --> 12:56.560
government's efforts.

12:56.560 --> 13:00.240
In essence, you were a kulak based on the arbitrary conception of whatever red guard

13:00.240 --> 13:03.420
you happened to bump into who thought you might have too much stuff, and if somebody

13:03.420 --> 13:07.180
in your village hated you, all they had to do was tell a red guard that you were a kulak.

13:07.180 --> 13:12.180
This resulted in a large-scale revolt against Soviet rule, in response to which Lenin's

13:12.180 --> 13:17.000
famous hanging order was declared, hang without fail so the people see no fewer than one hundred

13:17.000 --> 13:21.680
known kulaks, rich men, bloodsuckers, do it in such a way that for hundreds of kilometers

13:21.680 --> 13:26.180
around the people will see, tremble, know, shout, they are strangling and will strangle

13:26.180 --> 13:28.440
to death the bloodsucker kulaks.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.320
By 1929, collectivization was well underway.

13:31.320 --> 13:36.320
By this point, anyone who had used hired labor, owned a mill, owned a creamery, owned

13:36.320 --> 13:40.920
other equivalent farm processing equipment, owned any complex machine with a motor, or

13:40.920 --> 13:45.280
who had rented any such facility or machine, or who had traded their produce, lent their

13:45.280 --> 13:50.640
money, or engaged in any other form of non-labor income was considered a kulak by the government.

13:50.640 --> 13:53.620
Stalin finally ordered the liquidation of the kulaks as a class.

13:53.620 --> 13:57.400
This actually didn't initially mean killing them, but instead seizing their land and their

13:57.400 --> 14:01.520
produce, dispersing them from their organizations and ties with each other, and as isolated

14:01.520 --> 14:04.760
individuals folding them into the collectivized farm system.

14:04.760 --> 14:08.120
In response to this, the kulaks destroyed their own farms and butchered all of their

14:08.120 --> 14:10.640
livestock rather than letting them fall into Soviet hands.

14:10.640 --> 14:14.800
They did manage to eat or trade some of their produce, but a lot of it was simply lost.

14:14.800 --> 14:18.080
It was at this point that Stalin actually had them purged.

14:18.080 --> 14:21.920
Without the kulaks and their produce, the Soviet agricultural sector lacked both the

14:21.920 --> 14:27.160
expertise and the materials necessary to create food, leading to the Soviet famine of 1932-33.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.640
The Red Army during this famine plundered the Ukrainian countryside to keep the Russian

14:30.640 --> 14:34.200
cities fed, leading to what is considered a genocide of the Ukrainian people.

14:34.200 --> 14:38.500
In my opinion, the reason that this always seems to happen to farmers isn't solely because

14:38.500 --> 14:41.880
the government's stability relies on them bringing food to market, though that's part

14:41.880 --> 14:46.360
of it, but it's also because the farmers, at least partially, exist outside of a system

14:46.360 --> 14:47.360
of government control.

14:47.360 --> 14:49.400
Yes, there are farm subsidies.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.620
Governments do like to buy the loyalty of farmers, but that's about the only lever of

14:52.620 --> 14:54.080
power that they actually have.

14:54.080 --> 14:57.960
Imagine you're a bug-eating, pod-dwelling, soy-sipping city worker.

14:57.960 --> 15:01.320
Your lifestyle requires that the supply chain keep bringing food into the city.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.920
No farms, no food, and you can't live the way that you do.

15:03.920 --> 15:07.000
Now imagine that you're living in a mining town or a wood mill town.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.920
Some other form of production that is important, some other way of living that is not a city,

15:10.920 --> 15:12.280
but it's still not related to food.

15:12.280 --> 15:15.640
Even though you're doing meaningful labor, you still ultimately rely on the local farm

15:15.640 --> 15:16.640
to feed you.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.880
You simply trade your labor for theirs.

15:18.880 --> 15:22.880
In both cases, the government can tweak your behavior through incentives by managing the

15:22.880 --> 15:23.880
supply chain.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.240
That can't be done with farmers.

15:25.240 --> 15:28.080
You can't withhold food from people who produce it, unless you're willing to point

15:28.080 --> 15:29.560
guns at them like the Soviets did.

15:29.560 --> 15:30.920
And we saw how that ended up.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.280
This is one of the great contradictions of socialism.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.400
You will often hear these two talking points come out of the mouth of any socialist.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.400
1.

15:37.400 --> 15:38.400
The workers should own their own labor.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.400
2.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.400
That food is a human right.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.160
These are mutually exclusive.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.160
Farmers are workers.

15:43.160 --> 15:46.240
If a farmer owns his labor, then he owns the food it produces.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.660
That's his tools, his materials, his capital, his labor.

15:48.660 --> 15:51.020
So the product of it, the food, that's his too.

15:51.020 --> 15:54.780
But if food is a human right, then the farmer does not actually own his labor, the people

15:54.780 --> 15:55.780
do.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.360
The people have a right to the farmer's food, the farmer's labor.

15:57.360 --> 16:00.900
And for him to exert his own ownership, he necessarily has to violate the rights of other

16:00.900 --> 16:03.000
people under any socialist framework.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.140
When these two statements come into conflict, and they always do, time and again, the socialist

16:07.140 --> 16:10.820
rejects the worker should own his labor for food is a human right.

16:10.820 --> 16:13.500
The Soviets did not consider the kulaks to own their own labor.

16:13.500 --> 16:14.860
Instead, the people owned it.

16:14.860 --> 16:18.780
And that sentiment is expressed in modern times, thankfully without the backing of state

16:18.780 --> 16:19.780
force.

16:19.780 --> 16:23.740
They claim that farmers or truckers should not be allowed to protest and that instead

16:23.740 --> 16:27.300
have to get back to work to keep producing the products that the cities have a right

16:27.300 --> 16:28.300
to.

16:28.300 --> 16:29.700
But it's all sleight of hand in the end.

16:29.700 --> 16:33.560
If you find that rare, honest socialist, he will tell you that a worker doesn't really

16:33.560 --> 16:37.940
have a right to his own labor under their system, rather that workers as a class have

16:37.940 --> 16:39.760
a right to their collective labor.

16:39.760 --> 16:44.200
Under a socialist framework, you as an individual don't have the right to exclusively own your

16:44.200 --> 16:47.140
own labor, as in you and only you own it.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.940
There is no standing apart from the collective in their system.

16:49.940 --> 16:53.460
Only workers as a class have a right to their labor, which means that workers of a class

16:53.460 --> 16:55.100
have a right to your labor.

16:55.100 --> 16:58.780
And if you deny other people your labor, you are violating their rights.

16:58.780 --> 17:02.100
Even for all the faults with the India example that I talked about earlier, the fact that

17:02.100 --> 17:06.380
Modi was right-leaning at least led him to attempt to liberalize rather than socialize

17:06.380 --> 17:10.520
his market and also led him to ultimately back down when he figured out that his reforms

17:10.520 --> 17:11.520
were deeply unpopular.

17:11.520 --> 17:14.900
Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, this has been going on for three years, mismanagement in

17:14.900 --> 17:19.740
Sri Lanka for over ten, and the Soviets created one of the great bloodbaths of human history.

17:19.740 --> 17:24.620
All because of the natural human impulse of productive people to individually, exclusively

17:24.620 --> 17:29.840
own and control that which they create, and how centralized systems of power tend not

17:29.840 --> 17:32.960
to be able to tolerate this individualistic impulse.

17:32.960 --> 17:37.420
The reason the left hates working-class protests like these farmer strikes is because it puts

17:37.420 --> 17:41.300
on display for all to see the hypocrisy and subversion of socialism.
