0	9120	Everyone's making a big deal about the Dutch farmer protests online right now.
9120	12120	It's not hard to drop onto social media and see posts like this.
12120	15320	You'll never see this photo of Dutch farmers on your TV.
15320	17160	And to be fair, yeah, it's a pretty striking photo.
17160	20160	You've got the highway lined up with tractors throughout the entire shot.
20160	22160	It's very symmetrical and the colors are pretty good.
22160	25160	This looks like one of those photos that could be considered historic down the line.
25160	27440	Of course, the rightoids are there to push their narrative.
27440	31040	Social media is interviewing people, both farmers who believe that the government ultimately
31040	34520	wants their land and is using the current legislation as a way to bully them out.
34520	37800	To former police officers who are more than willing to discuss what will happen if the
37800	38960	farmer protests continue.
38960	44120	Dutch farmers are saying no to the great reset and climate communism is a pretty good headline
44120	47500	if you want your post to go viral within rightist circles.
47500	51600	And to their credit, we are seeing arrests of the protesters by the police.
51600	55200	Even one shooting by the police that ended up with one person injured and thankfully
55200	56200	nobody dead.
56360	58320	This is the right wing's dream come true.
58320	62160	The whole thing fits into their anti-globalist, Klaus Schwab narrative.
62160	64720	Here's the TLDR of these protests as I understand them.
64720	68320	In 2019, the government of the Netherlands announced that their country was in a nitrogen
68320	69320	emission crisis.
69320	73220	The Netherlands is the second largest exporter of food in the world after the US.
73220	77200	And this huge amount of food production has led to nitrogen emissions that are destroying
77200	80640	the very soil the food is grown in, let alone the rest of the environment.
80640	84520	The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, otherwise known as the
84520	90040	RIVM, the acronym makes sense in Dutch, released a study showing that 46% of the Netherlands'
90040	94280	nitrogen emissions come from the agricultural sector, a good chunk of that being from cows.
94280	97500	And so the government intends to put a hard cap on farm emissions.
97500	101360	The farmers in reply said that those numbers were off and that the government has an incentive
101360	106080	to blame the farmers for the emissions because tackling the actual cause was too hard.
106080	110100	Another large source of nitrogen emissions is power plants and to a lesser extent exhaust
110100	111100	from cars.
111100	114100	At the end of the day, in order to tackle the nitrogen problem, the government was going
114180	118260	to have to take on either the farmers, the car manufacturers or big energy and the government
118260	119320	chose the farmers.
119320	123700	Or alternatively, you could also continue to develop technology that prevents nitrogen
123700	127320	emission or cleans it up afterwards, which Netherlands is already doing because the study
127320	132200	shows a 30% decrease between 2005 and 2018, despite the increased production.
132200	133660	But let's forget about that.
133660	137620	And maybe some rhinoids don't want to admit it, but nitrogen emission is actually a real
137620	138620	problem.
138620	142980	Large parts of the Netherlands are naturally nitrogen-low biomes like bogs that are slowly
142980	147160	getting encroached on by nitrogen-loving forest plants like shrubs and grass.
147160	150620	This change will lead to an extinction of some types of herbs and flowers, which in
150620	154560	turn will lead to an extinction of some types of bugs that feed off of those plants, which
154560	158980	in turn will lead to an extinction of some types of birds that feed off those bugs.
158980	163020	Nitrogen runoff into the water causes a massive burst of algae growth, which can be toxic
163020	164500	to a lot of local marine life.
164500	166800	The environmental concern isn't exactly fake news here.
166800	169700	These things have a snowballing effect that can absolutely come back to bite us in the
169700	170700	ass in unforeseen ways.
170700	172820	But it's not just nitrogen concerns.
172860	176100	Another large part of it is the rise of animal rights activists in the Netherlands.
176100	180180	Yeah, believe it or not, these hippies have actually managed to get some sway within Dutch
180180	181180	politics.
181180	185500	What ultimately kicked off these protests back in 2019 was 200 of these people illegally
185500	187060	occupying a pig farm.
187060	190940	It was this event that caused the farmers to organize into activist collectives, the
190940	193140	most prominent one being the Farmer Defense Force.
193140	197300	And it's been these organizations that have gathered up these protests on behalf of the
197300	198300	country's farmers.
198300	201980	They're almost like an informal farmers union engaging in a general strike.
201980	204180	The protests have been on and off ever since then.
204180	207460	But in the English speaking world, we're really only hearing about them now because
207460	212940	on June 10, 2022, despite three years of protests and negotiations, the government has ultimately
212940	213940	gone ahead with its plan.
213940	218820	They've designated 24.3 billion euros to the implementation of agricultural reforms
218820	223900	that aim to halve nitrogen emissions by 2030 and close approximately 30% of the farms in
223900	224900	the Netherlands.
224900	229200	These actions have led to all of those viral videos and photos of farmers blocking roads
229200	232360	and the empty store shelves that you see on social media right now.
232360	236160	And the right is all over covering these events while the left is strangely silent.
236160	239800	That's not even pushing back, you know, usually they'll call the right wingers climate deniers
239800	242680	and racists, but this time they're just acting like they don't even know what's happening
242680	243680	at all.
243680	244680	Maybe they don't.
244680	246000	It's not like they pay attention to what the right is doing.
246000	249960	But as your local centrist fence sitter, I do actually pay attention to what everyone's
249960	251160	doing as much as I can.
251160	253100	And I'm reminded of a similar situation.
253100	256740	The farmer protests in India, India, like the Netherlands produces more than enough
256740	258040	food to feed its population.
258040	261140	However, unlike the Netherlands, India still faces a hunger problem.
261140	264760	Part of the reason why is because farming isn't as efficient there and neither is
264760	266040	their distribution network.
266040	271800	In 2004, then prime minister of India Manmohan Singh said, we need a second green revolution
271800	273760	making use of modern advances.
273760	278160	For that we need to revitalize India's research agricultural system, India's extension system,
278160	279160	India's credit system.
279160	282500	The more we commercialize our agriculture, the more our farmers need access to commercial
282500	283500	inputs.
283500	285940	And that was a modernization of our agriculture credit system.
285940	289740	There are other rigidities because of the whole marketing regime set up in the 1930s,
289740	293180	which prevent our farmers from selling their produce where they get the highest rate of
293180	294180	return.
294180	297860	It is our intention to remove all of these handicaps which come in the way of India realizing
297860	300520	its vast potential as one large common market.
300520	304640	Singh is referring to the Mandy system set up by India's Agricultural Produce Market
304640	305640	Committee.
305640	310040	Mandys are specialized government run marketplaces where produce is sold via auction and they
310040	313220	are the only place that farmers are allowed to sell their produce in India.
313220	316720	This system was set up first by the colonial government and then continued after India's
316720	321200	independence from the UK because their rulers recognized that India was in a fragile state.
321200	325140	In order to not simply become a consumer nation of other nation's products, government intervention
325140	329360	would be required to protect local production until it got on its feet and was able to compete
329360	330660	in a global marketplace.
330660	333660	The Mandy system continued for nearly 100 years.
333660	338160	In 2020, the current prime minister, Narendra Modi, spoke on the need for India to get rid
338160	339300	of the Mandy system.
339300	342400	His government passed three bills, colloquially known as the Farm Bills.
342400	344980	The first one allowed farmers to sell their produce anywhere.
344980	348980	The second one allowed for contract farming between a farmer and the buyer of his produce.
348980	352800	The third one allowed for the regulation of production in times of extreme need.
352800	357420	In response, throughout late 2020 until November of 2021, there was a massive general strike
357420	361020	by India's farmers who had grown accustomed to the protection that the regulation of the
361020	362020	Mandy system provided them.
362020	365320	Additionally, the farmers also didn't want the government to have the power to regulate
365320	366320	their production.
366320	369800	Tens of thousands of farmers driving their tractors and riding their horses protested
369800	372400	by blocking highways into and out of Delhi.
372400	373880	Police arrested the protesters.
373880	375140	Protesters broke through barricades.
375140	378160	Police and the farmers clashed, leading to many injuries and deaths.
378160	382400	This continued for months until, in November of 2021, Modi repealed the three Farm Bills.
382400	386200	While this was happening, I don't recall seeing many right-leaning people talking about
386200	387200	it.
387200	388200	But the left?
388200	391760	Oh man, every breadtuber, every shitty Prague streamer, every terminally-online verified
391760	395040	account was talking about this, about how this was the socialist praxis in action, how
395040	397960	the working class was rising up against the bourgeoisie in India, despite none of them
397960	401160	knowing a single fucking thing that was going on or anything about India's politics.
401160	403200	It's not hard to see the parallels, though, is it?
403200	405320	In both cases, the government decided to fuck with farmers.
405320	409220	The farmers organized and unionized and engaged in a general strike, stopping not only their
409220	412840	own production but shutting down other segments of society because their demands were not
412840	413840	being met.
413840	417700	And the English-speaking world, foreign to both events, only had something to say about
417700	420140	it when it fit their specific narrative.
420140	423480	Rightoids ignored the India protests, just like the leftoids are ignoring the Dutch protests.
423480	427140	And it's because Prime Minister Modi is the leader of India's right-wing party while
427140	429700	the Dutch farmers are protesting a left-wing government.
429700	432780	To be clear, I'm not only saying that people are specifically ignoring it for partisan
432780	435660	reasons, I'm sure that happens but it's not the only factor, I'm also saying that
435660	440060	if you don't have an ideological predisposition to support the protests, they're not even
440060	441640	going to hit your social media feed.
441640	445420	This is just a hunch, but I bet a lot of right-leaning people probably never even heard a peep about
445420	448660	the India protests, it just never hit their radar, and the same thing is probably happening
448660	450660	to left-leaning people right now over the Netherlands.
450660	454180	Also, if you want another parallel, it's funny as fuck that in both instances the government
454180	458820	was labelled as fascist, in India because of Modi's unapologetically pro-India stance,
458820	462180	and in the Netherlands because of the government's seeming desire to turn his workforce into
462180	463180	serfs.
463180	464180	There's a wider trend here, though.
464180	467980	For example, here in Canada, Trudeau has quietly announced that his government wants to pursue
467980	471780	the same policies as in the Netherlands, and farmers are already preparing to protest.
471780	475300	Farmers already took part in the blockade as part of the Ottawa trucker protest, yes
475300	478820	that's still coming, which was another working class general strike against government action.
478820	482820	A couple of online socialists who still retain a few brain cells, like Shue for example,
482820	486620	was dismayed at the broader left's reaction to the trucker protest, saying,
486620	490100	Do leftists cheering this on understand that Canada isn't freezing the bank accounts
490100	493040	of protesters because they're fascists or whatever, but that they are freezing them
493040	495420	because the convoy is now threatening capital?
495420	497740	What do you think a general strike would be like?
497740	498740	And Shue was correct.
498740	502660	For all of the socialist bluster about the proletariat's revolt, when it actually happens,
502660	505900	the socialists scream about how the truckers and the farmers aren't actually the proletariat.
505900	509920	The revolt of the workers was actually a fascist insurrection against them, and that they needed
509920	514560	to be at the least dispersed and better yet forced back to work, producing the goods and
514560	516680	services that the left requires of them.
516680	520120	Another event going viral right now is the massive protests in the Democratic Socialist
520120	524360	Republic of Sri Lanka, with dramatic footage of the presidential palace being stormed January
524360	525360	6th style.
525360	528680	And yes, it is real socialism, all you have to do is examine their economic policies recently.
528680	532240	Since 2010, Sri Lanka has taken on enormous amounts of debt, primarily from China.
532240	536060	The government tried to spend its way out of the crisis, and did so by cutting taxes
536060	537520	and printing a shit ton of money.
537520	541120	And this, it directly ignored the advice of the IMF, the International Monetary Fund.
541120	544700	You know, that thing that socialists claim is the arm of neoliberal colonialism that
544700	548280	rolls into the third world and liberalizes their economies and turns them into capitalist
548280	549280	surf states?
549280	553080	Well, that same IMF advised Sri Lanka to stop printing so much money.
553080	556280	Sri Lanka said, fuck you, I'm socialist, I'll do what I want, and then they basically destroyed
556280	557280	their economy.
557280	561880	But more interesting for the purposes of this video is that Sri Lanka also banned non-organic
561880	565200	farming, and in doing so also banned most types of fertilizer.
565200	570040	There was an instant loss of tea production, costing the country 425 million dollars.
570040	574200	Within six months, the country was producing 20% less rice, and transitioned from being
574200	579620	self-sufficient in food production to having to import food at a cost of 450 million dollars.
579620	583640	As expected, the farmers started to revolt and organize, you've heard this story before.
583640	587480	Government's response was to simply print more money and pay the farmers off with it,
587480	588960	which didn't exactly work.
588960	592280	So the question remains, what is it with governments trying to fuck with farmers?
592280	594160	Maybe governments just innately fear them.
594200	597360	There is that old saying that every society is a few weeks away from collapse or something,
597360	601040	referencing the fact that if food stops making it from farm to store at a table, no amount
601040	605520	of bribery or force will keep a population from overthrowing its government, or die trying.
605520	608960	Though maybe it's something a little bit deeper than that.
608960	610900	We all know about the kulaks at this point, don't we?
610900	612920	Well here's the story anyway, for completionist's sake.
612920	615880	In the Soviet Union, Russian farmers were divided into three classes.
615880	620140	Benyaks, the poor peasants, Srednyaks, the medium income peasants, and kulaks, the high
620140	621140	income peasants.
621140	624660	By high income, the socialists meant that the farmers had at least eight acres of land.
624660	627620	Just so you can visualize it, one acre is just under half of a baseball field.
627620	631780	So if you had four baseball fields worth of land, you were a high income peasant by Soviet
631780	632780	standards.
632780	636340	During the final years of the Russian empire, the Stulpin reform was implemented.
636340	640020	This was a liberalization of the Russian agricultural economy, where peasants were able to gradually
640020	644700	come to own their own farms by paying off the old noble landowner class, which they
644700	648180	were once serfs of, using a monthly portion of their farm earnings.
648180	652300	Though there were differences in quality of land, it's generally recognized as historical
652300	656820	fact that the Stulpin system allowed for harder working farmers to acquire more land over
656820	659500	time, making it somewhat of a meritocratic system.
659500	662800	By the time of the communist revolution, the most successful of the Russian farmers under
662800	666860	the Stulpin system were considered the kulaks, and were labeled as class traitors by the
666860	667860	government.
667860	672620	In everyday Stalinism, ordinary life in extraordinary times, Sheila Fitzpatrick wrote that the Soviet
672620	676340	regime was adept at creating its own enemies, whom it then suspected of conspiracy against
676340	677340	the state.
677500	679820	He wrote that he would go first by declaring that all members of certain social classes
679820	684300	and estates, primarily former nobles, members of the bourgeoisie, priests, and kulaks, were
684300	689120	by definition class enemies, resentful of their loss of privilege, and likely to engage
689120	691420	in counter-revolutionary conspiracy to recover them.
691420	695420	Fitzpatrick came to this conclusion primarily through Lenin's own words, who said in a
695420	697140	speech in August of 1918,
697140	699500	The kulaks are rabid foes of the Soviet government.
699500	703500	Either the kulaks massacre a vast number of workers, or the workers ruthlessly suppress
703500	707340	the revolts of the predatory kulak minority of the people against the working people's
707340	708340	government.
708340	709580	There can be no middle course.
709580	710780	Peace is out of the question.
710780	714100	Even if they have quarreled, the kulak can easily come to terms with the landowner, the
714100	715100	czar, and the priest.
715100	716740	But with the working class, never.
716740	720580	The class-conscious workers' program is the closest alliance and complete unity with
720580	724760	the poor peasants, concessions to and agreement with the middle peasants, and ruthless suppression
724760	729140	of the kulaks, those bloodsuckers, vampires, plunderers of the people, and profiteers who
729140	730360	batten on famine.
730360	734840	Robert Conquest's book of the dekulakization of Ukraine, The Harvest of Sorrow, details
734840	739360	that during this summer of 1918, the Red Army poured out of the cities and into the countryside
739360	743240	in order to begin the collectivization process of all the farmland, and began to seize grain
743240	745040	for transport into the urban centers.
745040	748760	Conquest wrote, the land of the landlords had been spontaneously seized by the peasants
748760	750480	in 1917-18.
750480	754960	A small class of richer peasants with around 50-80 acres had then been expropriated by
754960	755960	the Bolsheviks.
755960	761840	Far after, a Marxist conception of class struggle led to an almost totally imaginary class categorization
761840	766040	being inflicted in the villages, where peasants with a couple of cows or five or six acres
766040	770160	more than their neighbors were now being labeled as kulaks, and a class war against them was
770160	771360	being declared.
771360	775440	Who was actually a kulak was not based on any sort of subjective criteria, despite the
775440	776560	government's efforts.
776560	780240	In essence, you were a kulak based on the arbitrary conception of whatever red guard
780240	783420	you happened to bump into who thought you might have too much stuff, and if somebody
783420	787180	in your village hated you, all they had to do was tell a red guard that you were a kulak.
787180	792180	This resulted in a large-scale revolt against Soviet rule, in response to which Lenin's
792180	797000	famous hanging order was declared, hang without fail so the people see no fewer than one hundred
797000	801680	known kulaks, rich men, bloodsuckers, do it in such a way that for hundreds of kilometers
801680	806180	around the people will see, tremble, know, shout, they are strangling and will strangle
806180	808440	to death the bloodsucker kulaks.
808440	811320	By 1929, collectivization was well underway.
811320	816320	By this point, anyone who had used hired labor, owned a mill, owned a creamery, owned
816320	820920	other equivalent farm processing equipment, owned any complex machine with a motor, or
820920	825280	who had rented any such facility or machine, or who had traded their produce, lent their
825280	830640	money, or engaged in any other form of non-labor income was considered a kulak by the government.
830640	833620	Stalin finally ordered the liquidation of the kulaks as a class.
833620	837400	This actually didn't initially mean killing them, but instead seizing their land and their
837400	841520	produce, dispersing them from their organizations and ties with each other, and as isolated
841520	844760	individuals folding them into the collectivized farm system.
844760	848120	In response to this, the kulaks destroyed their own farms and butchered all of their
848120	850640	livestock rather than letting them fall into Soviet hands.
850640	854800	They did manage to eat or trade some of their produce, but a lot of it was simply lost.
854800	858080	It was at this point that Stalin actually had them purged.
858080	861920	Without the kulaks and their produce, the Soviet agricultural sector lacked both the
861920	867160	expertise and the materials necessary to create food, leading to the Soviet famine of 1932-33.
867160	870640	The Red Army during this famine plundered the Ukrainian countryside to keep the Russian
870640	874200	cities fed, leading to what is considered a genocide of the Ukrainian people.
874200	878500	In my opinion, the reason that this always seems to happen to farmers isn't solely because
878500	881880	the government's stability relies on them bringing food to market, though that's part
881880	886360	of it, but it's also because the farmers, at least partially, exist outside of a system
886360	887360	of government control.
887360	889400	Yes, there are farm subsidies.
889400	892620	Governments do like to buy the loyalty of farmers, but that's about the only lever of
892620	894080	power that they actually have.
894080	897960	Imagine you're a bug-eating, pod-dwelling, soy-sipping city worker.
897960	901320	Your lifestyle requires that the supply chain keep bringing food into the city.
901320	903920	No farms, no food, and you can't live the way that you do.
903920	907000	Now imagine that you're living in a mining town or a wood mill town.
907000	910920	Some other form of production that is important, some other way of living that is not a city,
910920	912280	but it's still not related to food.
912280	915640	Even though you're doing meaningful labor, you still ultimately rely on the local farm
915640	916640	to feed you.
916640	918880	You simply trade your labor for theirs.
918880	922880	In both cases, the government can tweak your behavior through incentives by managing the
922880	923880	supply chain.
923880	925240	That can't be done with farmers.
925240	928080	You can't withhold food from people who produce it, unless you're willing to point
928080	929560	guns at them like the Soviets did.
929560	930920	And we saw how that ended up.
930920	933280	This is one of the great contradictions of socialism.
933280	936400	You will often hear these two talking points come out of the mouth of any socialist.
936400	937400	1.
937400	938400	The workers should own their own labor.
938400	939400	2.
939400	940400	That food is a human right.
940400	942160	These are mutually exclusive.
942160	943160	Farmers are workers.
943160	946240	If a farmer owns his labor, then he owns the food it produces.
946240	948660	That's his tools, his materials, his capital, his labor.
948660	951020	So the product of it, the food, that's his too.
951020	954780	But if food is a human right, then the farmer does not actually own his labor, the people
954780	955780	do.
955780	957360	The people have a right to the farmer's food, the farmer's labor.
957360	960900	And for him to exert his own ownership, he necessarily has to violate the rights of other
960900	963000	people under any socialist framework.
963000	967140	When these two statements come into conflict, and they always do, time and again, the socialist
967140	970820	rejects the worker should own his labor for food is a human right.
970820	973500	The Soviets did not consider the kulaks to own their own labor.
973500	974860	Instead, the people owned it.
974860	978780	And that sentiment is expressed in modern times, thankfully without the backing of state
978780	979780	force.
979780	983740	They claim that farmers or truckers should not be allowed to protest and that instead
983740	987300	have to get back to work to keep producing the products that the cities have a right
987300	988300	to.
988300	989700	But it's all sleight of hand in the end.
989700	993560	If you find that rare, honest socialist, he will tell you that a worker doesn't really
993560	997940	have a right to his own labor under their system, rather that workers as a class have
997940	999760	a right to their collective labor.
999760	1004200	Under a socialist framework, you as an individual don't have the right to exclusively own your
1004200	1007140	own labor, as in you and only you own it.
1007140	1009940	There is no standing apart from the collective in their system.
1009940	1013460	Only workers as a class have a right to their labor, which means that workers of a class
1013460	1015100	have a right to your labor.
1015100	1018780	And if you deny other people your labor, you are violating their rights.
1018780	1022100	Even for all the faults with the India example that I talked about earlier, the fact that
1022100	1026380	Modi was right-leaning at least led him to attempt to liberalize rather than socialize
1026380	1030520	his market and also led him to ultimately back down when he figured out that his reforms
1030520	1031520	were deeply unpopular.
1031520	1034900	Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, this has been going on for three years, mismanagement in
1034900	1039740	Sri Lanka for over ten, and the Soviets created one of the great bloodbaths of human history.
1039740	1044620	All because of the natural human impulse of productive people to individually, exclusively
1044620	1049840	own and control that which they create, and how centralized systems of power tend not
1049840	1052960	to be able to tolerate this individualistic impulse.
1052960	1057420	The reason the left hates working-class protests like these farmer strikes is because it puts
1057420	1061300	on display for all to see the hypocrisy and subversion of socialism.
