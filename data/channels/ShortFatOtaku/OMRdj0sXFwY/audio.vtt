00:00.000 --> 00:09.920
At this point, I've written around 4 videos, and I'm dissatisfied with all of them.

00:09.920 --> 00:13.880
There's something missing in each one, some spice, some of Dev's special sauce.

00:13.880 --> 00:17.040
I've even recorded a couple of them, and I'm going to have to go back and re-record

00:17.040 --> 00:21.200
some parts or add some new information, because I'm just not satisfied with them.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.080
And I've finally figured out why.

00:23.080 --> 00:27.400
Before I go any further on this channel, we need to discuss an idea called concept creep,

00:27.400 --> 00:30.360
because it will be useful to describe what comes next.

00:30.360 --> 00:35.720
Concept creep is a relatively new term, coming out of Nick Haslam's 2016 psychology paper,

00:35.720 --> 00:39.480
Concept Creep, psychology's expanding concepts of harm and pathology.

00:39.480 --> 00:43.080
Many of psychology's concepts have undergone semantic shifts in recent years.

00:43.080 --> 00:46.000
These conceptual changes follow a consistent trend.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.940
Concepts that refer to the negative aspects of human experience and behavior have expanded

00:49.940 --> 00:54.540
their meanings so much that they now encompass a much broader range of phenomena than before.

00:54.540 --> 00:57.620
This expansion takes horizontal and vertical forms.

00:57.620 --> 01:02.580
Concepts extend outward to capture qualitatively new phenomena, and downward to capture quantitatively

01:02.580 --> 01:03.980
less extreme phenomena.

01:03.980 --> 01:09.660
The concepts of abuse, bullying, trauma, mental disorder, addiction, and prejudice are examined

01:09.660 --> 01:11.620
to illustrate these historical changes.

01:11.620 --> 01:15.840
In each case, the concept's boundary has stretched, and its meaning has dilated.

01:15.840 --> 01:20.580
A variety of explanations for concept creep are considered, and its implications are explored.

01:20.580 --> 01:25.620
I contend that the expansion primarily reflects an ever-increasing sensitivity to harm, reflecting

01:25.620 --> 01:27.000
a liberal moral agenda.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.820
Its implications are ambivalent, however.

01:28.820 --> 01:32.780
Although conceptual change is inevitable and often well-motivated, concept creep runs the

01:32.780 --> 01:37.820
risk of pathologizing everyday experience and encouraging a sense of virtuous but impotent

01:37.820 --> 01:38.820
victimhood.

01:38.820 --> 01:41.700
In other words, the definitions of various words are being expanded to include more and

01:41.700 --> 01:42.700
more stuff.

01:42.700 --> 01:45.260
Stuff that was not previously included, but was on the edge.

01:45.260 --> 01:48.040
An example Haslam gives in the paper is the word bullying.

01:48.040 --> 01:52.840
In the 1970s, the term bullying was coined to describe aggressive behavior among children

01:52.840 --> 01:56.280
that was intentional, repeated, and perpetrated downward in a power hierarchy.

01:56.280 --> 02:00.760
However, over time, the definition of bullying expanded horizontally to include similar behaviors

02:00.760 --> 02:04.840
in different circumstances, like adults in workplaces, online instead of offline, or

02:04.840 --> 02:08.320
shunning or intimidating behavior rather than direct aggression.

02:08.320 --> 02:12.520
The definition also expanded vertically to include less extreme behavior committed within

02:12.520 --> 02:16.080
a similar dynamic, such as acts that were unintentional, unrepeated, and directed at

02:16.080 --> 02:18.840
people of equal or higher power within the hierarchy.

02:18.840 --> 02:22.400
Sometimes, concept creep is simply a product of greater understanding.

02:22.400 --> 02:27.260
It seems reasonable, for example, to describe bullying-like behavior between adults within

02:27.260 --> 02:31.840
a workplace hierarchy as a form of bullying, even if the term was created specifically

02:31.840 --> 02:32.840
to describe children.

02:32.840 --> 02:35.360
In fact, workplaces can be quite childish sometimes.

02:35.360 --> 02:38.300
But other times, concept creep can be extremely destructive.

02:38.300 --> 02:42.640
If a person does a behavior to you that, under normal circumstances, would be bullying, but

02:42.640 --> 02:46.520
he claims it was an accident, he apologizes, and he doesn't do it again, were you actually

02:46.520 --> 02:47.520
bullied?

02:47.520 --> 02:50.040
By some people's definitions, the answer is yes because of concept creep.

02:50.040 --> 02:52.280
But that makes the term bullying useless.

02:52.280 --> 02:56.160
In other words, sometimes the boundaries of a concept expand because the concept is relatively

02:56.160 --> 02:59.780
new and we recognize something outside the boundary that any reasonable person can see

02:59.780 --> 03:00.980
should be included.

03:00.980 --> 03:05.320
And other times, the boundaries of a concept expand because it serves somebody's interest,

03:05.320 --> 03:09.160
and the integrity of the concept itself becomes a secondary concern.

03:09.160 --> 03:13.160
Since Haslam's 2016 definition of concept creep, psychological research on the topic

03:13.160 --> 03:16.040
has grown steadily, by Haslam and others working alongside him.

03:16.040 --> 03:20.960
In 2020, Haslam and Melanie J. McGrath penned an article on concept creep's effect on

03:20.960 --> 03:29.040
the word trauma, noticing that in 1884, a German doctor, Georg Edward von Rheinfelsch

03:29.040 --> 03:34.060
described trauma as any external attack which forcibly alters the physical or chemical composition

03:34.060 --> 03:35.840
of a part or a whole of the body.

03:35.840 --> 03:40.320
While nowadays, trauma can refer to not only physical injury or illness, but infidelity,

03:40.320 --> 03:44.800
both complicated and uncomplicated childbirth, graduate school, violence within the media,

03:44.800 --> 03:48.480
and overheard sexist jokes by a few strangers that you walk by on the street.

03:48.480 --> 03:55.400
In 2021, Haslam, along with Ekaterina Vojumova, Michael Ziffer, and Yoshihisa Kashima, published

03:55.400 --> 04:00.160
The Cultural Dynamics of Concept Creep, which describes concept creep in not only a psychological

04:00.160 --> 04:02.800
context but in cultural and social contexts.

04:02.800 --> 04:06.720
The article posits that attention paid to concepts involving harm has increased in Western

04:06.720 --> 04:11.080
society, leading to both an expansion of the concept of harm as well as a greater sensitivity

04:11.080 --> 04:12.080
to it.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.880
The article also touches on how this social and cultural shift is related to the expansion

04:15.880 --> 04:19.800
of left-wing politics across the same time period, though it doesn't go into detail,

04:19.800 --> 04:21.080
leaving it for a future paper.

04:21.080 --> 04:25.140
Ironically enough, the phrase concept creep has undergone its own form of concept creep,

04:25.140 --> 04:28.600
leaving the psychological space and moving into the wider lexicon, adopting new meanings

04:28.600 --> 04:29.600
as it goes.

04:29.600 --> 04:30.600
Here's what I mean.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.540
Codependency was coined initially to describe people who were emotionally entangled with

04:34.540 --> 04:39.000
drug users and therefore were co-addicted and co-dependent on the drug, not because

04:39.000 --> 04:42.680
they used the drug but because they needed to manage the behaviors of a person who did.

04:42.680 --> 04:46.460
But nowadays, codependent is used to describe an entire array of behaviors that have nothing

04:46.460 --> 04:49.840
to do with the original concept, and in fact, depending on the circumstance, might not even

04:49.840 --> 04:53.280
be pathological, like having some personal boundaries that are non-standard, or being

04:53.280 --> 04:56.580
a people pleaser, or simply being dependent on those that you trust.

04:56.580 --> 05:00.740
The term narcissism is a specific personality disorder, but it's become common to simply

05:00.740 --> 05:03.820
label any jerk-like behavior as narcissism.

05:03.820 --> 05:07.920
Even if the person is much more likely to be antisocial, or borderline, or histrionic,

05:07.920 --> 05:12.220
or just a jerk, not all negative behavior is bad enough to be considered disordered.

05:12.220 --> 05:17.540
The term gaslighting came from the 1938 play Gaslight, where a man tries to make his wife

05:17.540 --> 05:21.940
and others think she's insane by physically moving things around in their apartment just

05:21.940 --> 05:26.340
slightly and then telling her that she's wrong and possibly going nuts when she notices.

05:26.340 --> 05:30.740
Part of this process involves literally dimming the gas-fed lamps and then telling her that

05:30.740 --> 05:31.740
nothing's changed.

05:31.740 --> 05:32.740
It's always been that way.

05:32.740 --> 05:36.340
The double meaning of the play's title, referring to both the actual gas lights, as well as

05:36.340 --> 05:40.260
the idea of a woman going crazy due to her partner's influence, and how that metaphorically

05:40.260 --> 05:45.060
maps onto a small flame exploding if you add gas, caused the phrase gaslighting to take

05:45.060 --> 05:47.980
on a psychological meaning long after the play ran its course.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.580
And fair enough, it's a pretty useful term.

05:49.580 --> 05:54.300
But in 2022, gaslighting seems to be used to describe any form of invalidation for another

05:54.300 --> 05:55.300
person.

05:55.300 --> 05:58.180
If you're in a fight with your partner and the two of you are disagreeing over the facts

05:58.180 --> 06:02.100
of an ambiguous situation, that your partner's gaslighting you, and that's just absurd.

06:02.100 --> 06:06.260
One of the most famous concept creeps is the term emotional labor, which was most prominent

06:06.260 --> 06:09.220
online about five years ago floating around feminist spaces.

06:09.220 --> 06:13.300
Arlie Hochschild coined the term in the 1983 book The Managed Heart.

06:13.300 --> 06:17.540
She used it to describe the labor of managing one's own emotions that was acquired by certain

06:17.540 --> 06:18.540
professions.

06:18.540 --> 06:22.500
Obvious examples are having to smile and be polite in the face of a rude customer in a

06:22.500 --> 06:26.500
service job, or in a stressful situation as a flight attendant, or having to maintain

06:26.500 --> 06:29.900
a professional demeanor while dealing with heinous crimes in their perpetrators when

06:29.900 --> 06:34.480
you're a cop or a lawyer or a judge, or even having to act a bit harsher than you'd normally

06:34.480 --> 06:37.820
like to if you're a coach or a trainer or a bill collector.

06:37.820 --> 06:41.660
But the definition of emotional labor has expanded to include the labor women do when

06:41.660 --> 06:42.660
they care.

06:42.660 --> 06:46.500
Caring about the men in their lives, the husbands, fathers, brothers, sons, and how those men

06:46.500 --> 06:50.560
expect to be comforted sometimes takes up time and energy from women.

06:50.560 --> 06:54.600
Women feminists who rely on this definition point out how this emotional labor is invisible,

06:54.600 --> 06:56.400
unpaid, and rarely recognized.

06:56.400 --> 07:00.120
This expanded definition links in very well with other feminist talking points of the

07:00.120 --> 07:03.460
time about how women who stay at home don't get paid for the service of maintaining the

07:03.460 --> 07:05.000
house and raising the children.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.540
And in 2022, emotional labor has expanded again from that other definition to include

07:09.540 --> 07:11.160
just regular household stuff.

07:11.160 --> 07:14.160
If a woman does the dishes and a man's dirty dishes are also in the sink with hers, it's

07:14.160 --> 07:15.160
emotional labor.

07:15.160 --> 07:18.280
If a woman does the laundry and a man's laundry is also in the hamper with hers, it's emotional

07:18.280 --> 07:19.280
labor.

07:19.280 --> 07:20.280
It's just labor.

07:20.280 --> 07:21.280
It's just the job.

07:21.280 --> 07:25.120
But in talking about emotional labor, we're now on the fence between the psychological

07:25.120 --> 07:26.440
and the social, aren't we?

07:26.440 --> 07:30.520
And like I said earlier, concept creep can accurately be applied to many non-psychological

07:30.520 --> 07:31.520
domains.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.680
At this point, if you're as plugged in as me, your spidey senses are probably tingling,

07:34.680 --> 07:35.680
aren't they?

07:35.680 --> 07:36.680
You know what I'm about to say.

07:36.680 --> 07:39.360
Consider how the progs use the following words in current year.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.360
Racism.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.360
Misogyny.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.360
Bigotry.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.360
Homophobia.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.360
Transphobia.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.360
Islamophobia.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.360
Trans rights.

07:46.360 --> 07:47.360
Nazi.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.360
Fascist.

07:48.440 --> 07:51.600
The other two that I thought of that I didn't include, like diversity or inclusion, actually

07:51.600 --> 07:54.080
underwent a different process than concept creep.

07:54.080 --> 07:58.100
They had complete changes in definition, rather than an expansion of their boundaries.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.100
But the others, oh boy.

07:59.100 --> 08:03.360
Remember in like 2012 to 2016, the massive expansion of the word racist?

08:03.360 --> 08:08.360
How things that were clearly not racist, just normal, everyday stuff, became racist?

08:08.360 --> 08:12.460
And then, after the word racist got thrown around enough, eventually everybody got desensitized

08:12.460 --> 08:13.460
to it.

08:13.460 --> 08:16.160
Nobody cared if they were called racist anymore, because that was just as likely to impart

08:16.160 --> 08:19.400
information about your accuser than it was to impart information about you?

08:19.400 --> 08:22.640
Well, at that point, the progs shifted to fascist.

08:22.640 --> 08:26.560
Remember how, from like 2018 onward, there was a massive expansion of the word fascist?

08:26.560 --> 08:30.720
How things that were clearly not fascist, just normal, everyday stuff, became fascist?

08:30.720 --> 08:34.360
I wonder what's going to happen when people stop caring that they're being called fascists.

08:34.360 --> 08:37.540
Here's the problem with concept creep, in this sociological sense.

08:37.540 --> 08:40.040
Let's use the concept of racism as an example.

08:40.040 --> 08:43.840
Dressing up in a white hood, and burning a cross in the front lawn of a black man, and

08:43.840 --> 08:47.240
then jumping him and hanging him off a tree when he comes out to see what's going on,

08:47.240 --> 08:48.960
that's pretty clearly a racist act.

08:48.960 --> 08:53.620
But disliking a black woman's kinky hair, by the 2022 standard, is also a racist act.

08:53.620 --> 08:57.120
So clearly there's a spectrum between the two, because these are not the same thing,

08:57.120 --> 09:01.240
and calling them both racist makes the word significantly less useful nowadays, due to

09:01.240 --> 09:03.760
the huge difference between the two ends of the spectrum.

09:03.760 --> 09:07.320
Nowadays, if somebody were to tell me, hey that guy over there is a racist, I don't

09:07.320 --> 09:10.600
know if he just wants black people to straighten their hair before coming in to work, or if

09:10.600 --> 09:12.400
he literally boot fucks them in the street.

09:12.400 --> 09:15.120
The term rape has undergone a similar transition.

09:15.120 --> 09:20.040
Rape expanded to include non-penetrative sexual assault, then to include over the closed molestation,

09:20.040 --> 09:23.560
then to include consensual sex that the person wasn't happy with the next morning, then to

09:23.560 --> 09:27.560
include behavior that isn't even sexual but is perceived as rapey.

09:27.560 --> 09:31.760
Probably the most memetic, and early example of this process, was the phrase stare rape.

09:31.760 --> 09:35.080
Yeah this image is from like 2011, but it eventually became a real thing.

09:35.080 --> 09:38.800
Within the political realm, concept creep is heavily linked to the Mott and Bailey debate

09:38.800 --> 09:42.980
tactic, where a person conflates two similar positions, the first being modest and easy

09:42.980 --> 09:45.480
to defend, the second being significantly more controversial.

09:45.480 --> 09:49.160
They advance the controversial position, but when they're attacked, they claim as defense

09:49.160 --> 09:50.440
the more modest position.

09:50.440 --> 09:54.900
Which is why a BLM activist might demand the same level of moral righteousness be directed

09:54.900 --> 10:00.000
towards a stuffy boss who dislikes kinky hair as towards a slave owner or a hooded KKK member,

10:00.000 --> 10:03.840
or a feminist activist may demand the same consideration as the victim of a violent rape

10:03.840 --> 10:07.660
that left them disfigured for her experience where a dude awkwardly hit on her, she shot

10:07.660 --> 10:09.140
him down and he left her alone.

10:09.140 --> 10:13.460
I mentioned earlier that Haslam saw a correlation between concept creep in the social sense

10:13.460 --> 10:17.020
and left-leaning politics, and that was going to be a topic that he hoped to research in

10:17.020 --> 10:18.020
the future.

10:18.020 --> 10:20.100
Since that paper hasn't been published yet, I mean, who's to say?

10:20.100 --> 10:23.940
But intuitionally, I'm just sitting here thinking, like, yes, obviously.

10:23.940 --> 10:28.460
Robert Conquest was a British historian who, despite his published books, is most well-remembered

10:28.460 --> 10:29.900
for his three laws of politics.

10:29.900 --> 10:33.020
He never actually wrote these laws down on any of his books, but he spoke about them

10:33.020 --> 10:34.020
extensively.

10:34.020 --> 10:38.940
His three laws are, one, everyone is conservative about what he knows best, two, any organization

10:38.940 --> 10:43.180
not explicitly right-wing sooner or later becomes left-wing, three, the simplest way

10:43.180 --> 10:47.020
to explain the behavior of any bureaucratic organization is to assume that it's being

10:47.020 --> 10:48.940
controlled by a cabal of its enemies.

10:48.940 --> 10:52.860
The most rock-solid of these three laws seems to be the first one, and that is the one relevant

10:52.860 --> 10:54.140
to today's conversation.

10:54.140 --> 10:58.500
It seems to me that part of the experience of being young is rapidly and easily creating

10:58.500 --> 11:00.860
correlations and associations within your head.

11:00.860 --> 11:03.660
Everything is new to you, you're learning about the basics of the world, the connections

11:03.700 --> 11:06.340
that you form while you're a child are deep and lasting.

11:06.340 --> 11:08.820
It's not just what pain feels like and what causes it.

11:08.820 --> 11:11.460
What's the difference between a cut, a burn, a sting, and a bruise?

11:11.460 --> 11:14.700
It's not just what colors look like, or what happens when you drop a ball out a window,

11:14.700 --> 11:16.580
or why birds can fly but people can't.

11:16.580 --> 11:20.220
It's also stuff like your home is a safe, familiar place, or maybe it's not, or what

11:20.220 --> 11:23.740
your favorite foods are, or maybe what you hate, how much you like your family, your

11:23.740 --> 11:26.740
friends, your teacher, your school, or how much you don't like them.

11:26.740 --> 11:30.460
It's also stuff like the feel of the surface of your kitchen countertop, or the sound in

11:30.460 --> 11:33.320
your ears as you lie in a bathtub filling with warm water.

11:33.320 --> 11:37.520
In your formative years, you learn about the rules of reality while, at the same time,

11:37.520 --> 11:41.680
imbuing your perception of that reality with meaning that is specific to you.

11:41.680 --> 11:44.680
Hence that famous line, there are many like it, but this one is mine.

11:44.680 --> 11:47.880
We have grown to think of that quotation as being a little bit sinister, but it doesn't

11:47.880 --> 11:48.880
have to be.

11:48.880 --> 11:52.260
It's simply describing an emotional attachment to a specific thing, and it doesn't only

11:52.260 --> 11:53.640
apply to guns.

11:53.640 --> 11:58.380
Everybody might have had a Nintendo 64 growing up, but my childhood N64 is mine, and from

11:58.380 --> 12:01.020
my point of view, it's got an irreplaceable quality.

12:01.020 --> 12:03.280
But as you get older, this process slows down quite a bit.

12:03.280 --> 12:06.540
Psychologically speaking, this is called crystallization, where all of the knowledge you've gained

12:06.540 --> 12:10.380
begins to crystallize into place, and becomes the foundation upon which you build your adult

12:10.380 --> 12:11.380
life.

12:11.380 --> 12:13.900
But it's not always the case that you've simply learned a bunch of stuff that's become

12:13.900 --> 12:17.220
crystallized, and your learning circuits have shut off, and that's who you are, and that's

12:17.220 --> 12:18.220
that.

12:18.220 --> 12:22.300
That can happen, sure, but it seems to me that for a mature, well-rounded individual,

12:22.300 --> 12:26.180
they haven't actually stopped learning, they're just relying on a level of mastery that they

12:26.180 --> 12:27.180
have.

12:27.180 --> 12:30.280
Consider a child first learning to use a ruler, and compare him with a carpenter who's been

12:30.280 --> 12:32.160
measuring for 30 years of his adult life.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.760
The child may make all sorts of moves that the adult will consider to be mistakes.

12:35.760 --> 12:38.640
He may ask, why does one foot have to be this long?

12:38.640 --> 12:40.160
Why can't it be longer or shorter?

12:40.160 --> 12:43.200
He may not fully grasp how to do the math, or even what math is.

12:43.200 --> 12:46.760
This doesn't make him dumb, and the fact that the adult doesn't ask these questions doesn't

12:46.760 --> 12:49.080
mean that he's unable to learn new things.

12:49.080 --> 12:54.280
Conquest's first law, everyone is conservative about what he knows best, is a law about mastery.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.320
What distinguishes a novice from a master?

12:56.320 --> 12:58.760
What does it mean to know a thing, and what does it mean to learn?

12:58.760 --> 13:02.800
And it's not about close-mindedness, even though that is, from the leftist perspective,

13:02.800 --> 13:06.880
a necessary conservative trait, and that is how a leftist would read this quotation.

13:06.880 --> 13:10.000
It's more like, if you know something, you've already experimented with it.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.560
You've already experienced what constitutes success and failure.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.860
You don't need to be more open, because you've already honed in on the truth.

13:15.860 --> 13:20.380
That is what the conservative virtue is in this conversation, having a very tight focus.

13:20.380 --> 13:22.840
So let's bring this back to the concept pre-conversation.

13:22.840 --> 13:25.200
Consider the bread-tuber who calls everything and everyone a fascist.

13:25.200 --> 13:28.360
To him, everyone on the right is a fascist, and everyone not him is on the right.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.880
The various distinctions and differences don't really matter.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.360
Conservatives are fascist because they voted for Trump.

13:32.360 --> 13:35.240
Soccer moms are fascist because they like the local cops who come into their diner that

13:35.240 --> 13:36.240
she works at.

13:36.240 --> 13:39.320
Video games are fascist because they promote competition and edgy behavior online.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.960
Sockdams are fascist too, because they seek to relieve the working class's material

13:42.960 --> 13:45.360
conditions while preventing a socialist revolution.

13:45.360 --> 13:49.040
Look at how the definition of fascism, in their minds, has concept-creeped its way to

13:49.040 --> 13:52.400
encompassing a huge swath of people, to the point that the term is meaningless.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.740
Meanwhile, the same bread-tuber will be very strict about which flavor of leftism that

13:55.740 --> 13:56.740
he is.

13:56.740 --> 14:00.740
And what tiny granular distinction makes him radically different from other types of leftists?

14:00.740 --> 14:04.500
To him, there is a hard boundary between a Marxist-Leninist, a Stalinist, a Maoist, a

14:04.500 --> 14:07.420
libertarian socialist, and a narco-syndicalist, a Christian socialist.

14:07.420 --> 14:08.840
I mean, look at all this shit.

14:08.840 --> 14:11.500
The description of leftism itself reads like a leftist meme.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.300
Remember conquest's first law.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.720
Everyone is conservative about what he knows best.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.580
Most bread-tubers don't know about the true nature of right-wing politics.

14:18.580 --> 14:20.260
They simply see them all as the other.

14:20.260 --> 14:23.520
The same way that a great empire does not distinguish between the many different tribes

14:23.520 --> 14:24.520
beyond the border.

14:24.520 --> 14:25.520
They're all simply barbarians.

14:25.520 --> 14:26.520
And you know what?

14:26.800 --> 14:28.600
It's pretty easy and convenient to do that.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.240
This way, you don't have to become knowledgeable about who you oppose.

14:31.240 --> 14:32.800
You can simply treat them all the same.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.720
Who cares about the borders that divide them if they're basically the same thing anyway?

14:35.720 --> 14:37.400
They're not you, and that's what's important.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.580
But the bread-tuber does know about their own politics very deeply, and so the borders

14:40.580 --> 14:42.280
for those concepts are rock solid.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.080
And yes, the right-wing does this too.

14:44.080 --> 14:47.560
I've heard many right-leaning people say that neo-conservatives and paleo-conservatives

14:47.560 --> 14:51.560
are radically different, and also that libertarians are not the same thing, and paleo-libertarians

14:51.560 --> 14:54.840
too, and monarchists and reactionaries are also at odds with the more republican-minded

14:54.840 --> 14:57.920
communists, and also that who cares, everyone on the left is a commie.

14:57.920 --> 15:01.860
From the milk-toast neo-lib establishment to the actual communists, people are actually

15:01.860 --> 15:03.960
more conservative with what they know.

15:03.960 --> 15:07.520
Because their deep knowledge allows them to see the topic more clearly.

15:07.520 --> 15:11.240
The borders are more defined, the concepts are more explored, but a lack of knowledge

15:11.240 --> 15:14.480
leads to fuzzy borders and the assumption that the topics that you have yet to explore

15:14.480 --> 15:16.260
are actually just as shallow as they appear.

15:16.260 --> 15:21.140
If I had to guess, this is why concept creep is oozing out of leftist spaces right now.

15:21.140 --> 15:24.300
Because of an actual lack of deep knowledge of the things they're opposing, combined

15:24.300 --> 15:29.380
with the fact that a leftist point of view does not easily lend itself to drawing harder

15:29.380 --> 15:30.380
borders.

15:30.380 --> 15:33.460
It's also a reason why people tend to become more conservative as they age, which was a

15:33.460 --> 15:37.420
topic of a previous video that I made, because as people become more knowledgeable, the borders

15:37.420 --> 15:39.260
between concepts become clearer.

15:39.260 --> 15:43.220
At the same time, tremendous political power has been seized by simply calling people a

15:43.220 --> 15:47.500
racist or a sexist or a fascist or a rapist, because it's very easy to demand the absolute

15:47.500 --> 15:51.180
worst reaction from others once you slap one of these labels on a person, even if what

15:51.180 --> 15:55.180
they actually did isn't deserving of that absolute worst reaction, because the concept

15:55.180 --> 15:56.180
has expanded.

15:56.180 --> 15:59.800
And I think that's why the right has finally adopted the same tactics.

15:59.800 --> 16:04.320
The phrase critical race theory has been tainted in this way, moving beyond the poisonous doctrine

16:04.320 --> 16:08.300
of the original thing, and is now actually being used to refer to even just teaching

16:08.300 --> 16:10.100
about the history of slavery in an appropriate way.

16:10.100 --> 16:11.660
And yes, that's actually happening.

16:11.660 --> 16:14.860
There are also right-oeds online saying that now that the pendulum is swinging once again,

16:14.860 --> 16:18.780
they need to stop pretending that pornography counts as free speech and move to ban it.

16:18.780 --> 16:23.540
And yes, McCarthy's wide anti-communist net catching legitimate non-communist also counts.

16:23.540 --> 16:27.300
The most relevant example right now is the current groomer discourse, where the right

16:27.300 --> 16:31.980
has finally found a label with both the sticking power and the inaccuracy of racist and fascist.

16:31.980 --> 16:36.340
Yes, there are a lot of bad actors out there, a lot of real groomers, that video is coming

16:36.340 --> 16:37.340
very soon.

16:37.340 --> 16:41.260
But for example, the teacher who is gay, who takes a few days off class to get married,

16:41.260 --> 16:45.300
and then when asked about his wife by a student casually says that it's his husband actually,

16:45.300 --> 16:49.180
that person isn't a groomer, and yet the outrage machine never ever sleeps.

16:49.180 --> 16:53.620
We are moving into what I think is going to be a pretty dark time epistemologically speaking.

16:53.620 --> 16:57.020
The left has been concept creeping its way across the intellectual landscape for over

16:57.020 --> 16:58.020
a decade now.

16:58.020 --> 17:01.300
And the right has basically just been holding their decks, impotently saying, hey, what

17:01.300 --> 17:02.420
happened to tolerance?

17:02.420 --> 17:05.220
Or what about the liberal idea of neutrality and openness?

17:05.220 --> 17:07.460
And the right moves slow, but they do eventually move.

17:07.460 --> 17:10.380
And they finally figured out that they're dealing with leftists, not liberals, that

17:10.380 --> 17:13.300
the name of the game is concept creep for political benefit.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.900
So now they're playing that game.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.920
And look at the leftoids screech.

17:16.920 --> 17:21.100
The sheer, unadulterated derangement of the groomer discourse is hard to overstate.

17:21.100 --> 17:22.100
Shut the fuck up.

17:22.100 --> 17:26.640
You retards have been baselessly calling everyone racist and Nazi since I was in high school.

17:26.640 --> 17:27.640
I don't like this.

17:27.640 --> 17:28.640
I don't support it.

17:28.640 --> 17:29.640
But I understand it.

17:29.640 --> 17:30.800
This is the world you built.

17:30.800 --> 17:31.800
You started this.

17:31.800 --> 17:32.800
You wanted this.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.260
You were the ones who said that civility in politics was toxic.

17:35.260 --> 17:39.100
You were the ones who said that the liberal idea of neutrality rested upon and implicitly

17:39.100 --> 17:42.360
held up the white supremacist capitalist patriarchal structures.

17:42.440 --> 17:46.320
You were the ones who infiltrated neutral institutions, changed definitions of words,

17:46.320 --> 17:50.320
pushed politics into every corner of life, and violated every compromise with the right

17:50.320 --> 17:51.720
that your predecessors struck.

17:51.720 --> 17:55.640
The only reason that you expect the right to keep playing by the same set of liberal

17:55.640 --> 17:59.140
rules that you yourself violate is because it would be good for you.

17:59.140 --> 18:02.120
And the only reason that you're complaining that the right is doing what you've done

18:02.120 --> 18:04.800
for years now is because it's going to be bad for you.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.340
I don't like what's happening.

18:06.340 --> 18:09.400
It's going to be terrible for us as a culture and a civilization.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.320
But this is the bed that the left has made for itself.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.240
Anyway, that's what concept creep is.

18:14.240 --> 18:17.600
A psychological topic that's made its way into politics, and it accurately describes

18:17.600 --> 18:22.280
the slow but steady corruption of various ideas into forms that explicitly benefit progressive

18:22.280 --> 18:23.280
politics.

18:23.280 --> 18:26.880
I was writing my Don't Say Gay video when I realized that over half of the video was

18:26.880 --> 18:31.160
stuck describing what concept creep was, and then I also realized all of my other upcoming

18:31.160 --> 18:34.440
videos relied on understanding of the topic, so I just cut the script off into its own

18:34.440 --> 18:35.440
thing.

18:35.440 --> 18:38.480
I hope you enjoyed it, and please keep in mind what I said here as we start exploring

18:38.480 --> 18:39.960
some of the other topics in the future.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.440
I will see you next time, guys.

18:41.440 --> 18:41.940
I love you.
