1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,920
At this point, I've written around 4 videos, and I'm dissatisfied with all of them.

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,880
There's something missing in each one, some spice, some of Dev's special sauce.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,040
I've even recorded a couple of them, and I'm going to have to go back and re-record

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,200
some parts or add some new information, because I'm just not satisfied with them.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,080
And I've finally figured out why.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,400
Before I go any further on this channel, we need to discuss an idea called concept creep,

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,360
because it will be useful to describe what comes next.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,720
Concept creep is a relatively new term, coming out of Nick Haslam's 2016 psychology paper,

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,480
Concept Creep, psychology's expanding concepts of harm and pathology.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,080
Many of psychology's concepts have undergone semantic shifts in recent years.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,000
These conceptual changes follow a consistent trend.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,940
Concepts that refer to the negative aspects of human experience and behavior have expanded

13
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,540
their meanings so much that they now encompass a much broader range of phenomena than before.

14
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,620
This expansion takes horizontal and vertical forms.

15
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,580
Concepts extend outward to capture qualitatively new phenomena, and downward to capture quantitatively

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,980
less extreme phenomena.

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:09,660
The concepts of abuse, bullying, trauma, mental disorder, addiction, and prejudice are examined

18
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,620
to illustrate these historical changes.

19
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,840
In each case, the concept's boundary has stretched, and its meaning has dilated.

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,580
A variety of explanations for concept creep are considered, and its implications are explored.

21
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,620
I contend that the expansion primarily reflects an ever-increasing sensitivity to harm, reflecting

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,000
a liberal moral agenda.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,820
Its implications are ambivalent, however.

24
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,780
Although conceptual change is inevitable and often well-motivated, concept creep runs the

25
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,820
risk of pathologizing everyday experience and encouraging a sense of virtuous but impotent

26
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,820
victimhood.

27
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,700
In other words, the definitions of various words are being expanded to include more and

28
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,700
more stuff.

29
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,260
Stuff that was not previously included, but was on the edge.

30
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,040
An example Haslam gives in the paper is the word bullying.

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,840
In the 1970s, the term bullying was coined to describe aggressive behavior among children

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,280
that was intentional, repeated, and perpetrated downward in a power hierarchy.

33
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,760
However, over time, the definition of bullying expanded horizontally to include similar behaviors

34
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,840
in different circumstances, like adults in workplaces, online instead of offline, or

35
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,320
shunning or intimidating behavior rather than direct aggression.

36
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,520
The definition also expanded vertically to include less extreme behavior committed within

37
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,080
a similar dynamic, such as acts that were unintentional, unrepeated, and directed at

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,840
people of equal or higher power within the hierarchy.

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,400
Sometimes, concept creep is simply a product of greater understanding.

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,260
It seems reasonable, for example, to describe bullying-like behavior between adults within

41
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,840
a workplace hierarchy as a form of bullying, even if the term was created specifically

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,840
to describe children.

43
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,360
In fact, workplaces can be quite childish sometimes.

44
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,300
But other times, concept creep can be extremely destructive.

45
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,640
If a person does a behavior to you that, under normal circumstances, would be bullying, but

46
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,520
he claims it was an accident, he apologizes, and he doesn't do it again, were you actually

47
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
bullied?

48
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,040
By some people's definitions, the answer is yes because of concept creep.

49
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,280
But that makes the term bullying useless.

50
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,160
In other words, sometimes the boundaries of a concept expand because the concept is relatively

51
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,780
new and we recognize something outside the boundary that any reasonable person can see

52
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,980
should be included.

53
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,320
And other times, the boundaries of a concept expand because it serves somebody's interest,

54
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,160
and the integrity of the concept itself becomes a secondary concern.

55
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,160
Since Haslam's 2016 definition of concept creep, psychological research on the topic

56
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,040
has grown steadily, by Haslam and others working alongside him.

57
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,960
In 2020, Haslam and Melanie J. McGrath penned an article on concept creep's effect on

58
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:29,040
the word trauma, noticing that in 1884, a German doctor, Georg Edward von Rheinfelsch

59
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,060
described trauma as any external attack which forcibly alters the physical or chemical composition

60
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,840
of a part or a whole of the body.

61
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,320
While nowadays, trauma can refer to not only physical injury or illness, but infidelity,

62
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,800
both complicated and uncomplicated childbirth, graduate school, violence within the media,

63
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,480
and overheard sexist jokes by a few strangers that you walk by on the street.

64
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:55,400
In 2021, Haslam, along with Ekaterina Vojumova, Michael Ziffer, and Yoshihisa Kashima, published

65
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,160
The Cultural Dynamics of Concept Creep, which describes concept creep in not only a psychological

66
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,800
context but in cultural and social contexts.

67
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,720
The article posits that attention paid to concepts involving harm has increased in Western

68
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,080
society, leading to both an expansion of the concept of harm as well as a greater sensitivity

69
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
to it.

70
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,880
The article also touches on how this social and cultural shift is related to the expansion

71
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,800
of left-wing politics across the same time period, though it doesn't go into detail,

72
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,080
leaving it for a future paper.

73
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,140
Ironically enough, the phrase concept creep has undergone its own form of concept creep,

74
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,600
leaving the psychological space and moving into the wider lexicon, adopting new meanings

75
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
as it goes.

76
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Here's what I mean.

77
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,540
Codependency was coined initially to describe people who were emotionally entangled with

78
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,000
drug users and therefore were co-addicted and co-dependent on the drug, not because

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,680
they used the drug but because they needed to manage the behaviors of a person who did.

80
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,460
But nowadays, codependent is used to describe an entire array of behaviors that have nothing

81
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,840
to do with the original concept, and in fact, depending on the circumstance, might not even

82
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,280
be pathological, like having some personal boundaries that are non-standard, or being

83
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,580
a people pleaser, or simply being dependent on those that you trust.

84
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,740
The term narcissism is a specific personality disorder, but it's become common to simply

85
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,820
label any jerk-like behavior as narcissism.

86
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,920
Even if the person is much more likely to be antisocial, or borderline, or histrionic,

87
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,220
or just a jerk, not all negative behavior is bad enough to be considered disordered.

88
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,540
The term gaslighting came from the 1938 play Gaslight, where a man tries to make his wife

89
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,940
and others think she's insane by physically moving things around in their apartment just

90
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,340
slightly and then telling her that she's wrong and possibly going nuts when she notices.

91
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,740
Part of this process involves literally dimming the gas-fed lamps and then telling her that

92
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,740
nothing's changed.

93
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,740
It's always been that way.

94
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,340
The double meaning of the play's title, referring to both the actual gas lights, as well as

95
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,260
the idea of a woman going crazy due to her partner's influence, and how that metaphorically

96
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,060
maps onto a small flame exploding if you add gas, caused the phrase gaslighting to take

97
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,980
on a psychological meaning long after the play ran its course.

98
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,580
And fair enough, it's a pretty useful term.

99
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,300
But in 2022, gaslighting seems to be used to describe any form of invalidation for another

100
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,300
person.

101
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,180
If you're in a fight with your partner and the two of you are disagreeing over the facts

102
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,100
of an ambiguous situation, that your partner's gaslighting you, and that's just absurd.

103
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,260
One of the most famous concept creeps is the term emotional labor, which was most prominent

104
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,220
online about five years ago floating around feminist spaces.

105
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,300
Arlie Hochschild coined the term in the 1983 book The Managed Heart.

106
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,540
She used it to describe the labor of managing one's own emotions that was acquired by certain

107
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,540
professions.

108
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,500
Obvious examples are having to smile and be polite in the face of a rude customer in a

109
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,500
service job, or in a stressful situation as a flight attendant, or having to maintain

110
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,900
a professional demeanor while dealing with heinous crimes in their perpetrators when

111
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,480
you're a cop or a lawyer or a judge, or even having to act a bit harsher than you'd normally

112
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,820
like to if you're a coach or a trainer or a bill collector.

113
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,660
But the definition of emotional labor has expanded to include the labor women do when

114
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,660
they care.

115
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,500
Caring about the men in their lives, the husbands, fathers, brothers, sons, and how those men

116
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,560
expect to be comforted sometimes takes up time and energy from women.

117
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,600
Women feminists who rely on this definition point out how this emotional labor is invisible,

118
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,400
unpaid, and rarely recognized.

119
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,120
This expanded definition links in very well with other feminist talking points of the

120
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,460
time about how women who stay at home don't get paid for the service of maintaining the

121
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,000
house and raising the children.

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,540
And in 2022, emotional labor has expanded again from that other definition to include

123
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,160
just regular household stuff.

124
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,160
If a woman does the dishes and a man's dirty dishes are also in the sink with hers, it's

125
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
emotional labor.

126
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,280
If a woman does the laundry and a man's laundry is also in the hamper with hers, it's emotional

127
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,280
labor.

128
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
It's just labor.

129
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
It's just the job.

130
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,120
But in talking about emotional labor, we're now on the fence between the psychological

131
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,440
and the social, aren't we?

132
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,520
And like I said earlier, concept creep can accurately be applied to many non-psychological

133
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
domains.

134
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,680
At this point, if you're as plugged in as me, your spidey senses are probably tingling,

135
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,680
aren't they?

136
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
You know what I'm about to say.

137
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,360
Consider how the progs use the following words in current year.

138
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Racism.

139
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Misogyny.

140
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
Bigotry.

141
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Homophobia.

142
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
Transphobia.

143
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
Islamophobia.

144
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
Trans rights.

145
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Nazi.

146
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
Fascist.

147
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,600
The other two that I thought of that I didn't include, like diversity or inclusion, actually

148
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,080
underwent a different process than concept creep.

149
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,100
They had complete changes in definition, rather than an expansion of their boundaries.

150
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,100
But the others, oh boy.

151
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,360
Remember in like 2012 to 2016, the massive expansion of the word racist?

152
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,360
How things that were clearly not racist, just normal, everyday stuff, became racist?

153
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,460
And then, after the word racist got thrown around enough, eventually everybody got desensitized

154
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,460
to it.

155
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,160
Nobody cared if they were called racist anymore, because that was just as likely to impart

156
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,400
information about your accuser than it was to impart information about you?

157
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,640
Well, at that point, the progs shifted to fascist.

158
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,560
Remember how, from like 2018 onward, there was a massive expansion of the word fascist?

159
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,720
How things that were clearly not fascist, just normal, everyday stuff, became fascist?

160
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,360
I wonder what's going to happen when people stop caring that they're being called fascists.

161
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,540
Here's the problem with concept creep, in this sociological sense.

162
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,040
Let's use the concept of racism as an example.

163
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,840
Dressing up in a white hood, and burning a cross in the front lawn of a black man, and

164
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,240
then jumping him and hanging him off a tree when he comes out to see what's going on,

165
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,960
that's pretty clearly a racist act.

166
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,620
But disliking a black woman's kinky hair, by the 2022 standard, is also a racist act.

167
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,120
So clearly there's a spectrum between the two, because these are not the same thing,

168
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,240
and calling them both racist makes the word significantly less useful nowadays, due to

169
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,760
the huge difference between the two ends of the spectrum.

170
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,320
Nowadays, if somebody were to tell me, hey that guy over there is a racist, I don't

171
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,600
know if he just wants black people to straighten their hair before coming in to work, or if

172
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,400
he literally boot fucks them in the street.

173
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,120
The term rape has undergone a similar transition.

174
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,040
Rape expanded to include non-penetrative sexual assault, then to include over the closed molestation,

175
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,560
then to include consensual sex that the person wasn't happy with the next morning, then to

176
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,560
include behavior that isn't even sexual but is perceived as rapey.

177
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,760
Probably the most memetic, and early example of this process, was the phrase stare rape.

178
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,080
Yeah this image is from like 2011, but it eventually became a real thing.

179
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,800
Within the political realm, concept creep is heavily linked to the Mott and Bailey debate

180
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,980
tactic, where a person conflates two similar positions, the first being modest and easy

181
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,480
to defend, the second being significantly more controversial.

182
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,160
They advance the controversial position, but when they're attacked, they claim as defense

183
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,440
the more modest position.

184
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,900
Which is why a BLM activist might demand the same level of moral righteousness be directed

185
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:00,000
towards a stuffy boss who dislikes kinky hair as towards a slave owner or a hooded KKK member,

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,840
or a feminist activist may demand the same consideration as the victim of a violent rape

187
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,660
that left them disfigured for her experience where a dude awkwardly hit on her, she shot

188
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,140
him down and he left her alone.

189
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,460
I mentioned earlier that Haslam saw a correlation between concept creep in the social sense

190
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,020
and left-leaning politics, and that was going to be a topic that he hoped to research in

191
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,020
the future.

192
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,100
Since that paper hasn't been published yet, I mean, who's to say?

193
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,940
But intuitionally, I'm just sitting here thinking, like, yes, obviously.

194
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,460
Robert Conquest was a British historian who, despite his published books, is most well-remembered

195
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,900
for his three laws of politics.

196
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,020
He never actually wrote these laws down on any of his books, but he spoke about them

197
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,020
extensively.

198
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,940
His three laws are, one, everyone is conservative about what he knows best, two, any organization

199
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,180
not explicitly right-wing sooner or later becomes left-wing, three, the simplest way

200
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,020
to explain the behavior of any bureaucratic organization is to assume that it's being

201
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,940
controlled by a cabal of its enemies.

202
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,860
The most rock-solid of these three laws seems to be the first one, and that is the one relevant

203
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,140
to today's conversation.

204
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,500
It seems to me that part of the experience of being young is rapidly and easily creating

205
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,860
correlations and associations within your head.

206
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,660
Everything is new to you, you're learning about the basics of the world, the connections

207
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,340
that you form while you're a child are deep and lasting.

208
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,820
It's not just what pain feels like and what causes it.

209
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,460
What's the difference between a cut, a burn, a sting, and a bruise?

210
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,700
It's not just what colors look like, or what happens when you drop a ball out a window,

211
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,580
or why birds can fly but people can't.

212
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,220
It's also stuff like your home is a safe, familiar place, or maybe it's not, or what

213
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,740
your favorite foods are, or maybe what you hate, how much you like your family, your

214
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,740
friends, your teacher, your school, or how much you don't like them.

215
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,460
It's also stuff like the feel of the surface of your kitchen countertop, or the sound in

216
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,320
your ears as you lie in a bathtub filling with warm water.

217
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,520
In your formative years, you learn about the rules of reality while, at the same time,

218
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,680
imbuing your perception of that reality with meaning that is specific to you.

219
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,680
Hence that famous line, there are many like it, but this one is mine.

220
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,880
We have grown to think of that quotation as being a little bit sinister, but it doesn't

221
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
have to be.

222
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,260
It's simply describing an emotional attachment to a specific thing, and it doesn't only

223
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,640
apply to guns.

224
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,380
Everybody might have had a Nintendo 64 growing up, but my childhood N64 is mine, and from

225
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,020
my point of view, it's got an irreplaceable quality.

226
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,280
But as you get older, this process slows down quite a bit.

227
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,540
Psychologically speaking, this is called crystallization, where all of the knowledge you've gained

228
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,380
begins to crystallize into place, and becomes the foundation upon which you build your adult

229
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,380
life.

230
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,900
But it's not always the case that you've simply learned a bunch of stuff that's become

231
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,220
crystallized, and your learning circuits have shut off, and that's who you are, and that's

232
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,220
that.

233
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,300
That can happen, sure, but it seems to me that for a mature, well-rounded individual,

234
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,180
they haven't actually stopped learning, they're just relying on a level of mastery that they

235
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,180
have.

236
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,280
Consider a child first learning to use a ruler, and compare him with a carpenter who's been

237
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,160
measuring for 30 years of his adult life.

238
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,760
The child may make all sorts of moves that the adult will consider to be mistakes.

239
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,640
He may ask, why does one foot have to be this long?

240
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,160
Why can't it be longer or shorter?

241
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,200
He may not fully grasp how to do the math, or even what math is.

242
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,760
This doesn't make him dumb, and the fact that the adult doesn't ask these questions doesn't

243
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,080
mean that he's unable to learn new things.

244
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,280
Conquest's first law, everyone is conservative about what he knows best, is a law about mastery.

245
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,320
What distinguishes a novice from a master?

246
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,760
What does it mean to know a thing, and what does it mean to learn?

247
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,800
And it's not about close-mindedness, even though that is, from the leftist perspective,

248
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,880
a necessary conservative trait, and that is how a leftist would read this quotation.

249
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,000
It's more like, if you know something, you've already experimented with it.

250
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,560
You've already experienced what constitutes success and failure.

251
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,860
You don't need to be more open, because you've already honed in on the truth.

252
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,380
That is what the conservative virtue is in this conversation, having a very tight focus.

253
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,840
So let's bring this back to the concept pre-conversation.

254
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,200
Consider the bread-tuber who calls everything and everyone a fascist.

255
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,360
To him, everyone on the right is a fascist, and everyone not him is on the right.

256
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,880
The various distinctions and differences don't really matter.

257
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,360
Conservatives are fascist because they voted for Trump.

258
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,240
Soccer moms are fascist because they like the local cops who come into their diner that

259
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
she works at.

260
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,320
Video games are fascist because they promote competition and edgy behavior online.

261
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,960
Sockdams are fascist too, because they seek to relieve the working class's material

262
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,360
conditions while preventing a socialist revolution.

263
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,040
Look at how the definition of fascism, in their minds, has concept-creeped its way to

264
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,400
encompassing a huge swath of people, to the point that the term is meaningless.

265
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,740
Meanwhile, the same bread-tuber will be very strict about which flavor of leftism that

266
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,740
he is.

267
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,740
And what tiny granular distinction makes him radically different from other types of leftists?

268
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,500
To him, there is a hard boundary between a Marxist-Leninist, a Stalinist, a Maoist, a

269
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,420
libertarian socialist, and a narco-syndicalist, a Christian socialist.

270
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,840
I mean, look at all this shit.

271
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,500
The description of leftism itself reads like a leftist meme.

272
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,300
Remember conquest's first law.

273
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,720
Everyone is conservative about what he knows best.

274
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,580
Most bread-tubers don't know about the true nature of right-wing politics.

275
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,260
They simply see them all as the other.

276
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,520
The same way that a great empire does not distinguish between the many different tribes

277
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
beyond the border.

278
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,520
They're all simply barbarians.

279
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,520
And you know what?

280
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,600
It's pretty easy and convenient to do that.

281
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,240
This way, you don't have to become knowledgeable about who you oppose.

282
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,800
You can simply treat them all the same.

283
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,720
Who cares about the borders that divide them if they're basically the same thing anyway?

284
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,400
They're not you, and that's what's important.

285
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,580
But the bread-tuber does know about their own politics very deeply, and so the borders

286
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,280
for those concepts are rock solid.

287
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,080
And yes, the right-wing does this too.

288
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,560
I've heard many right-leaning people say that neo-conservatives and paleo-conservatives

289
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,560
are radically different, and also that libertarians are not the same thing, and paleo-libertarians

290
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,840
too, and monarchists and reactionaries are also at odds with the more republican-minded

291
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,920
communists, and also that who cares, everyone on the left is a commie.

292
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,860
From the milk-toast neo-lib establishment to the actual communists, people are actually

293
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,960
more conservative with what they know.

294
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,520
Because their deep knowledge allows them to see the topic more clearly.

295
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,240
The borders are more defined, the concepts are more explored, but a lack of knowledge

296
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,480
leads to fuzzy borders and the assumption that the topics that you have yet to explore

297
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,260
are actually just as shallow as they appear.

298
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:21,140
If I had to guess, this is why concept creep is oozing out of leftist spaces right now.

299
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,300
Because of an actual lack of deep knowledge of the things they're opposing, combined

300
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,380
with the fact that a leftist point of view does not easily lend itself to drawing harder

301
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,380
borders.

302
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,460
It's also a reason why people tend to become more conservative as they age, which was a

303
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,420
topic of a previous video that I made, because as people become more knowledgeable, the borders

304
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,260
between concepts become clearer.

305
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,220
At the same time, tremendous political power has been seized by simply calling people a

306
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,500
racist or a sexist or a fascist or a rapist, because it's very easy to demand the absolute

307
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,180
worst reaction from others once you slap one of these labels on a person, even if what

308
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,180
they actually did isn't deserving of that absolute worst reaction, because the concept

309
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,180
has expanded.

310
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,800
And I think that's why the right has finally adopted the same tactics.

311
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,320
The phrase critical race theory has been tainted in this way, moving beyond the poisonous doctrine

312
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,300
of the original thing, and is now actually being used to refer to even just teaching

313
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,100
about the history of slavery in an appropriate way.

314
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,660
And yes, that's actually happening.

315
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,860
There are also right-oeds online saying that now that the pendulum is swinging once again,

316
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,780
they need to stop pretending that pornography counts as free speech and move to ban it.

317
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:23,540
And yes, McCarthy's wide anti-communist net catching legitimate non-communist also counts.

318
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,300
The most relevant example right now is the current groomer discourse, where the right

319
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,980
has finally found a label with both the sticking power and the inaccuracy of racist and fascist.

320
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,340
Yes, there are a lot of bad actors out there, a lot of real groomers, that video is coming

321
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,340
very soon.

322
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,260
But for example, the teacher who is gay, who takes a few days off class to get married,

323
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,300
and then when asked about his wife by a student casually says that it's his husband actually,

324
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,180
that person isn't a groomer, and yet the outrage machine never ever sleeps.

325
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,620
We are moving into what I think is going to be a pretty dark time epistemologically speaking.

326
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,020
The left has been concept creeping its way across the intellectual landscape for over

327
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,020
a decade now.

328
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,300
And the right has basically just been holding their decks, impotently saying, hey, what

329
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,420
happened to tolerance?

330
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,220
Or what about the liberal idea of neutrality and openness?

331
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,460
And the right moves slow, but they do eventually move.

332
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,380
And they finally figured out that they're dealing with leftists, not liberals, that

333
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,300
the name of the game is concept creep for political benefit.

334
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,900
So now they're playing that game.

335
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,920
And look at the leftoids screech.

336
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,100
The sheer, unadulterated derangement of the groomer discourse is hard to overstate.

337
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,100
Shut the fuck up.

338
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,640
You retards have been baselessly calling everyone racist and Nazi since I was in high school.

339
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,640
I don't like this.

340
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,640
I don't support it.

341
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,640
But I understand it.

342
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,800
This is the world you built.

343
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
You started this.

344
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
You wanted this.

345
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,260
You were the ones who said that civility in politics was toxic.

346
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,100
You were the ones who said that the liberal idea of neutrality rested upon and implicitly

347
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,360
held up the white supremacist capitalist patriarchal structures.

348
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,320
You were the ones who infiltrated neutral institutions, changed definitions of words,

349
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,320
pushed politics into every corner of life, and violated every compromise with the right

350
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,720
that your predecessors struck.

351
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,640
The only reason that you expect the right to keep playing by the same set of liberal

352
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,140
rules that you yourself violate is because it would be good for you.

353
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,120
And the only reason that you're complaining that the right is doing what you've done

354
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,800
for years now is because it's going to be bad for you.

355
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,340
I don't like what's happening.

356
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,400
It's going to be terrible for us as a culture and a civilization.

357
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,320
But this is the bed that the left has made for itself.

358
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,240
Anyway, that's what concept creep is.

359
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,600
A psychological topic that's made its way into politics, and it accurately describes

360
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,280
the slow but steady corruption of various ideas into forms that explicitly benefit progressive

361
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
politics.

362
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,880
I was writing my Don't Say Gay video when I realized that over half of the video was

363
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,160
stuck describing what concept creep was, and then I also realized all of my other upcoming

364
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,440
videos relied on understanding of the topic, so I just cut the script off into its own

365
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
thing.

366
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,480
I hope you enjoyed it, and please keep in mind what I said here as we start exploring

367
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,960
some of the other topics in the future.

368
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,440
I will see you next time, guys.

369
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,940
I love you.
