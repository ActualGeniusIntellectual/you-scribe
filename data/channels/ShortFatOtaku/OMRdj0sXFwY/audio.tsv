0	9920	At this point, I've written around 4 videos, and I'm dissatisfied with all of them.
9920	13880	There's something missing in each one, some spice, some of Dev's special sauce.
13880	17040	I've even recorded a couple of them, and I'm going to have to go back and re-record
17040	21200	some parts or add some new information, because I'm just not satisfied with them.
21200	23080	And I've finally figured out why.
23080	27400	Before I go any further on this channel, we need to discuss an idea called concept creep,
27400	30360	because it will be useful to describe what comes next.
30360	35720	Concept creep is a relatively new term, coming out of Nick Haslam's 2016 psychology paper,
35720	39480	Concept Creep, psychology's expanding concepts of harm and pathology.
39480	43080	Many of psychology's concepts have undergone semantic shifts in recent years.
43080	46000	These conceptual changes follow a consistent trend.
46000	49940	Concepts that refer to the negative aspects of human experience and behavior have expanded
49940	54540	their meanings so much that they now encompass a much broader range of phenomena than before.
54540	57620	This expansion takes horizontal and vertical forms.
57620	62580	Concepts extend outward to capture qualitatively new phenomena, and downward to capture quantitatively
62580	63980	less extreme phenomena.
63980	69660	The concepts of abuse, bullying, trauma, mental disorder, addiction, and prejudice are examined
69660	71620	to illustrate these historical changes.
71620	75840	In each case, the concept's boundary has stretched, and its meaning has dilated.
75840	80580	A variety of explanations for concept creep are considered, and its implications are explored.
80580	85620	I contend that the expansion primarily reflects an ever-increasing sensitivity to harm, reflecting
85620	87000	a liberal moral agenda.
87000	88820	Its implications are ambivalent, however.
88820	92780	Although conceptual change is inevitable and often well-motivated, concept creep runs the
92780	97820	risk of pathologizing everyday experience and encouraging a sense of virtuous but impotent
97820	98820	victimhood.
98820	101700	In other words, the definitions of various words are being expanded to include more and
101700	102700	more stuff.
102700	105260	Stuff that was not previously included, but was on the edge.
105260	108040	An example Haslam gives in the paper is the word bullying.
108040	112840	In the 1970s, the term bullying was coined to describe aggressive behavior among children
112840	116280	that was intentional, repeated, and perpetrated downward in a power hierarchy.
116280	120760	However, over time, the definition of bullying expanded horizontally to include similar behaviors
120760	124840	in different circumstances, like adults in workplaces, online instead of offline, or
124840	128320	shunning or intimidating behavior rather than direct aggression.
128320	132520	The definition also expanded vertically to include less extreme behavior committed within
132520	136080	a similar dynamic, such as acts that were unintentional, unrepeated, and directed at
136080	138840	people of equal or higher power within the hierarchy.
138840	142400	Sometimes, concept creep is simply a product of greater understanding.
142400	147260	It seems reasonable, for example, to describe bullying-like behavior between adults within
147260	151840	a workplace hierarchy as a form of bullying, even if the term was created specifically
151840	152840	to describe children.
152840	155360	In fact, workplaces can be quite childish sometimes.
155360	158300	But other times, concept creep can be extremely destructive.
158300	162640	If a person does a behavior to you that, under normal circumstances, would be bullying, but
162640	166520	he claims it was an accident, he apologizes, and he doesn't do it again, were you actually
166520	167520	bullied?
167520	170040	By some people's definitions, the answer is yes because of concept creep.
170040	172280	But that makes the term bullying useless.
172280	176160	In other words, sometimes the boundaries of a concept expand because the concept is relatively
176160	179780	new and we recognize something outside the boundary that any reasonable person can see
179780	180980	should be included.
180980	185320	And other times, the boundaries of a concept expand because it serves somebody's interest,
185320	189160	and the integrity of the concept itself becomes a secondary concern.
189160	193160	Since Haslam's 2016 definition of concept creep, psychological research on the topic
193160	196040	has grown steadily, by Haslam and others working alongside him.
196040	200960	In 2020, Haslam and Melanie J. McGrath penned an article on concept creep's effect on
200960	209040	the word trauma, noticing that in 1884, a German doctor, Georg Edward von Rheinfelsch
209040	214060	described trauma as any external attack which forcibly alters the physical or chemical composition
214060	215840	of a part or a whole of the body.
215840	220320	While nowadays, trauma can refer to not only physical injury or illness, but infidelity,
220320	224800	both complicated and uncomplicated childbirth, graduate school, violence within the media,
224800	228480	and overheard sexist jokes by a few strangers that you walk by on the street.
228480	235400	In 2021, Haslam, along with Ekaterina Vojumova, Michael Ziffer, and Yoshihisa Kashima, published
235400	240160	The Cultural Dynamics of Concept Creep, which describes concept creep in not only a psychological
240160	242800	context but in cultural and social contexts.
242800	246720	The article posits that attention paid to concepts involving harm has increased in Western
246720	251080	society, leading to both an expansion of the concept of harm as well as a greater sensitivity
251080	252080	to it.
252080	255880	The article also touches on how this social and cultural shift is related to the expansion
255880	259800	of left-wing politics across the same time period, though it doesn't go into detail,
259800	261080	leaving it for a future paper.
261080	265140	Ironically enough, the phrase concept creep has undergone its own form of concept creep,
265140	268600	leaving the psychological space and moving into the wider lexicon, adopting new meanings
268600	269600	as it goes.
269600	270600	Here's what I mean.
270600	274540	Codependency was coined initially to describe people who were emotionally entangled with
274540	279000	drug users and therefore were co-addicted and co-dependent on the drug, not because
279000	282680	they used the drug but because they needed to manage the behaviors of a person who did.
282680	286460	But nowadays, codependent is used to describe an entire array of behaviors that have nothing
286460	289840	to do with the original concept, and in fact, depending on the circumstance, might not even
289840	293280	be pathological, like having some personal boundaries that are non-standard, or being
293280	296580	a people pleaser, or simply being dependent on those that you trust.
296580	300740	The term narcissism is a specific personality disorder, but it's become common to simply
300740	303820	label any jerk-like behavior as narcissism.
303820	307920	Even if the person is much more likely to be antisocial, or borderline, or histrionic,
307920	312220	or just a jerk, not all negative behavior is bad enough to be considered disordered.
312220	317540	The term gaslighting came from the 1938 play Gaslight, where a man tries to make his wife
317540	321940	and others think she's insane by physically moving things around in their apartment just
321940	326340	slightly and then telling her that she's wrong and possibly going nuts when she notices.
326340	330740	Part of this process involves literally dimming the gas-fed lamps and then telling her that
330740	331740	nothing's changed.
331740	332740	It's always been that way.
332740	336340	The double meaning of the play's title, referring to both the actual gas lights, as well as
336340	340260	the idea of a woman going crazy due to her partner's influence, and how that metaphorically
340260	345060	maps onto a small flame exploding if you add gas, caused the phrase gaslighting to take
345060	347980	on a psychological meaning long after the play ran its course.
347980	349580	And fair enough, it's a pretty useful term.
349580	354300	But in 2022, gaslighting seems to be used to describe any form of invalidation for another
354300	355300	person.
355300	358180	If you're in a fight with your partner and the two of you are disagreeing over the facts
358180	362100	of an ambiguous situation, that your partner's gaslighting you, and that's just absurd.
362100	366260	One of the most famous concept creeps is the term emotional labor, which was most prominent
366260	369220	online about five years ago floating around feminist spaces.
369220	373300	Arlie Hochschild coined the term in the 1983 book The Managed Heart.
373300	377540	She used it to describe the labor of managing one's own emotions that was acquired by certain
377540	378540	professions.
378540	382500	Obvious examples are having to smile and be polite in the face of a rude customer in a
382500	386500	service job, or in a stressful situation as a flight attendant, or having to maintain
386500	389900	a professional demeanor while dealing with heinous crimes in their perpetrators when
389900	394480	you're a cop or a lawyer or a judge, or even having to act a bit harsher than you'd normally
394480	397820	like to if you're a coach or a trainer or a bill collector.
397820	401660	But the definition of emotional labor has expanded to include the labor women do when
401660	402660	they care.
402660	406500	Caring about the men in their lives, the husbands, fathers, brothers, sons, and how those men
406500	410560	expect to be comforted sometimes takes up time and energy from women.
410560	414600	Women feminists who rely on this definition point out how this emotional labor is invisible,
414600	416400	unpaid, and rarely recognized.
416400	420120	This expanded definition links in very well with other feminist talking points of the
420120	423460	time about how women who stay at home don't get paid for the service of maintaining the
423460	425000	house and raising the children.
425000	429540	And in 2022, emotional labor has expanded again from that other definition to include
429540	431160	just regular household stuff.
431160	434160	If a woman does the dishes and a man's dirty dishes are also in the sink with hers, it's
434160	435160	emotional labor.
435160	438280	If a woman does the laundry and a man's laundry is also in the hamper with hers, it's emotional
438280	439280	labor.
439280	440280	It's just labor.
440280	441280	It's just the job.
441280	445120	But in talking about emotional labor, we're now on the fence between the psychological
445120	446440	and the social, aren't we?
446440	450520	And like I said earlier, concept creep can accurately be applied to many non-psychological
450520	451520	domains.
451520	454680	At this point, if you're as plugged in as me, your spidey senses are probably tingling,
454680	455680	aren't they?
455680	456680	You know what I'm about to say.
456680	459360	Consider how the progs use the following words in current year.
459360	460360	Racism.
460360	461360	Misogyny.
461360	462360	Bigotry.
462360	463360	Homophobia.
463360	464360	Transphobia.
464360	465360	Islamophobia.
465360	466360	Trans rights.
466360	467360	Nazi.
467360	468360	Fascist.
468440	471600	The other two that I thought of that I didn't include, like diversity or inclusion, actually
471600	474080	underwent a different process than concept creep.
474080	478100	They had complete changes in definition, rather than an expansion of their boundaries.
478100	479100	But the others, oh boy.
479100	483360	Remember in like 2012 to 2016, the massive expansion of the word racist?
483360	488360	How things that were clearly not racist, just normal, everyday stuff, became racist?
488360	492460	And then, after the word racist got thrown around enough, eventually everybody got desensitized
492460	493460	to it.
493460	496160	Nobody cared if they were called racist anymore, because that was just as likely to impart
496160	499400	information about your accuser than it was to impart information about you?
499400	502640	Well, at that point, the progs shifted to fascist.
502640	506560	Remember how, from like 2018 onward, there was a massive expansion of the word fascist?
506560	510720	How things that were clearly not fascist, just normal, everyday stuff, became fascist?
510720	514360	I wonder what's going to happen when people stop caring that they're being called fascists.
514360	517540	Here's the problem with concept creep, in this sociological sense.
517540	520040	Let's use the concept of racism as an example.
520040	523840	Dressing up in a white hood, and burning a cross in the front lawn of a black man, and
523840	527240	then jumping him and hanging him off a tree when he comes out to see what's going on,
527240	528960	that's pretty clearly a racist act.
528960	533620	But disliking a black woman's kinky hair, by the 2022 standard, is also a racist act.
533620	537120	So clearly there's a spectrum between the two, because these are not the same thing,
537120	541240	and calling them both racist makes the word significantly less useful nowadays, due to
541240	543760	the huge difference between the two ends of the spectrum.
543760	547320	Nowadays, if somebody were to tell me, hey that guy over there is a racist, I don't
547320	550600	know if he just wants black people to straighten their hair before coming in to work, or if
550600	552400	he literally boot fucks them in the street.
552400	555120	The term rape has undergone a similar transition.
555120	560040	Rape expanded to include non-penetrative sexual assault, then to include over the closed molestation,
560040	563560	then to include consensual sex that the person wasn't happy with the next morning, then to
563560	567560	include behavior that isn't even sexual but is perceived as rapey.
567560	571760	Probably the most memetic, and early example of this process, was the phrase stare rape.
571760	575080	Yeah this image is from like 2011, but it eventually became a real thing.
575080	578800	Within the political realm, concept creep is heavily linked to the Mott and Bailey debate
578800	582980	tactic, where a person conflates two similar positions, the first being modest and easy
582980	585480	to defend, the second being significantly more controversial.
585480	589160	They advance the controversial position, but when they're attacked, they claim as defense
589160	590440	the more modest position.
590440	594900	Which is why a BLM activist might demand the same level of moral righteousness be directed
594900	600000	towards a stuffy boss who dislikes kinky hair as towards a slave owner or a hooded KKK member,
600000	603840	or a feminist activist may demand the same consideration as the victim of a violent rape
603840	607660	that left them disfigured for her experience where a dude awkwardly hit on her, she shot
607660	609140	him down and he left her alone.
609140	613460	I mentioned earlier that Haslam saw a correlation between concept creep in the social sense
613460	617020	and left-leaning politics, and that was going to be a topic that he hoped to research in
617020	618020	the future.
618020	620100	Since that paper hasn't been published yet, I mean, who's to say?
620100	623940	But intuitionally, I'm just sitting here thinking, like, yes, obviously.
623940	628460	Robert Conquest was a British historian who, despite his published books, is most well-remembered
628460	629900	for his three laws of politics.
629900	633020	He never actually wrote these laws down on any of his books, but he spoke about them
633020	634020	extensively.
634020	638940	His three laws are, one, everyone is conservative about what he knows best, two, any organization
638940	643180	not explicitly right-wing sooner or later becomes left-wing, three, the simplest way
643180	647020	to explain the behavior of any bureaucratic organization is to assume that it's being
647020	648940	controlled by a cabal of its enemies.
648940	652860	The most rock-solid of these three laws seems to be the first one, and that is the one relevant
652860	654140	to today's conversation.
654140	658500	It seems to me that part of the experience of being young is rapidly and easily creating
658500	660860	correlations and associations within your head.
660860	663660	Everything is new to you, you're learning about the basics of the world, the connections
663700	666340	that you form while you're a child are deep and lasting.
666340	668820	It's not just what pain feels like and what causes it.
668820	671460	What's the difference between a cut, a burn, a sting, and a bruise?
671460	674700	It's not just what colors look like, or what happens when you drop a ball out a window,
674700	676580	or why birds can fly but people can't.
676580	680220	It's also stuff like your home is a safe, familiar place, or maybe it's not, or what
680220	683740	your favorite foods are, or maybe what you hate, how much you like your family, your
683740	686740	friends, your teacher, your school, or how much you don't like them.
686740	690460	It's also stuff like the feel of the surface of your kitchen countertop, or the sound in
690460	693320	your ears as you lie in a bathtub filling with warm water.
693320	697520	In your formative years, you learn about the rules of reality while, at the same time,
697520	701680	imbuing your perception of that reality with meaning that is specific to you.
701680	704680	Hence that famous line, there are many like it, but this one is mine.
704680	707880	We have grown to think of that quotation as being a little bit sinister, but it doesn't
707880	708880	have to be.
708880	712260	It's simply describing an emotional attachment to a specific thing, and it doesn't only
712260	713640	apply to guns.
713640	718380	Everybody might have had a Nintendo 64 growing up, but my childhood N64 is mine, and from
718380	721020	my point of view, it's got an irreplaceable quality.
721020	723280	But as you get older, this process slows down quite a bit.
723280	726540	Psychologically speaking, this is called crystallization, where all of the knowledge you've gained
726540	730380	begins to crystallize into place, and becomes the foundation upon which you build your adult
730380	731380	life.
731380	733900	But it's not always the case that you've simply learned a bunch of stuff that's become
733900	737220	crystallized, and your learning circuits have shut off, and that's who you are, and that's
737220	738220	that.
738220	742300	That can happen, sure, but it seems to me that for a mature, well-rounded individual,
742300	746180	they haven't actually stopped learning, they're just relying on a level of mastery that they
746180	747180	have.
747180	750280	Consider a child first learning to use a ruler, and compare him with a carpenter who's been
750280	752160	measuring for 30 years of his adult life.
752160	755760	The child may make all sorts of moves that the adult will consider to be mistakes.
755760	758640	He may ask, why does one foot have to be this long?
758640	760160	Why can't it be longer or shorter?
760160	763200	He may not fully grasp how to do the math, or even what math is.
763200	766760	This doesn't make him dumb, and the fact that the adult doesn't ask these questions doesn't
766760	769080	mean that he's unable to learn new things.
769080	774280	Conquest's first law, everyone is conservative about what he knows best, is a law about mastery.
774280	776320	What distinguishes a novice from a master?
776320	778760	What does it mean to know a thing, and what does it mean to learn?
778760	782800	And it's not about close-mindedness, even though that is, from the leftist perspective,
782800	786880	a necessary conservative trait, and that is how a leftist would read this quotation.
786880	790000	It's more like, if you know something, you've already experimented with it.
790000	792560	You've already experienced what constitutes success and failure.
792560	795860	You don't need to be more open, because you've already honed in on the truth.
795860	800380	That is what the conservative virtue is in this conversation, having a very tight focus.
800380	802840	So let's bring this back to the concept pre-conversation.
802840	805200	Consider the bread-tuber who calls everything and everyone a fascist.
805200	808360	To him, everyone on the right is a fascist, and everyone not him is on the right.
808360	810880	The various distinctions and differences don't really matter.
810880	812360	Conservatives are fascist because they voted for Trump.
812360	815240	Soccer moms are fascist because they like the local cops who come into their diner that
815240	816240	she works at.
816240	819320	Video games are fascist because they promote competition and edgy behavior online.
819320	822960	Sockdams are fascist too, because they seek to relieve the working class's material
822960	825360	conditions while preventing a socialist revolution.
825360	829040	Look at how the definition of fascism, in their minds, has concept-creeped its way to
829040	832400	encompassing a huge swath of people, to the point that the term is meaningless.
832400	835740	Meanwhile, the same bread-tuber will be very strict about which flavor of leftism that
835740	836740	he is.
836740	840740	And what tiny granular distinction makes him radically different from other types of leftists?
840740	844500	To him, there is a hard boundary between a Marxist-Leninist, a Stalinist, a Maoist, a
844500	847420	libertarian socialist, and a narco-syndicalist, a Christian socialist.
847420	848840	I mean, look at all this shit.
848840	851500	The description of leftism itself reads like a leftist meme.
851500	853300	Remember conquest's first law.
853300	855720	Everyone is conservative about what he knows best.
855720	858580	Most bread-tubers don't know about the true nature of right-wing politics.
858580	860260	They simply see them all as the other.
860260	863520	The same way that a great empire does not distinguish between the many different tribes
863520	864520	beyond the border.
864520	865520	They're all simply barbarians.
865520	866520	And you know what?
866800	868600	It's pretty easy and convenient to do that.
868600	871240	This way, you don't have to become knowledgeable about who you oppose.
871240	872800	You can simply treat them all the same.
872800	875720	Who cares about the borders that divide them if they're basically the same thing anyway?
875720	877400	They're not you, and that's what's important.
877400	880580	But the bread-tuber does know about their own politics very deeply, and so the borders
880580	882280	for those concepts are rock solid.
882280	884080	And yes, the right-wing does this too.
884080	887560	I've heard many right-leaning people say that neo-conservatives and paleo-conservatives
887560	891560	are radically different, and also that libertarians are not the same thing, and paleo-libertarians
891560	894840	too, and monarchists and reactionaries are also at odds with the more republican-minded
894840	897920	communists, and also that who cares, everyone on the left is a commie.
897920	901860	From the milk-toast neo-lib establishment to the actual communists, people are actually
901860	903960	more conservative with what they know.
903960	907520	Because their deep knowledge allows them to see the topic more clearly.
907520	911240	The borders are more defined, the concepts are more explored, but a lack of knowledge
911240	914480	leads to fuzzy borders and the assumption that the topics that you have yet to explore
914480	916260	are actually just as shallow as they appear.
916260	921140	If I had to guess, this is why concept creep is oozing out of leftist spaces right now.
921140	924300	Because of an actual lack of deep knowledge of the things they're opposing, combined
924300	929380	with the fact that a leftist point of view does not easily lend itself to drawing harder
929380	930380	borders.
930380	933460	It's also a reason why people tend to become more conservative as they age, which was a
933460	937420	topic of a previous video that I made, because as people become more knowledgeable, the borders
937420	939260	between concepts become clearer.
939260	943220	At the same time, tremendous political power has been seized by simply calling people a
943220	947500	racist or a sexist or a fascist or a rapist, because it's very easy to demand the absolute
947500	951180	worst reaction from others once you slap one of these labels on a person, even if what
951180	955180	they actually did isn't deserving of that absolute worst reaction, because the concept
955180	956180	has expanded.
956180	959800	And I think that's why the right has finally adopted the same tactics.
959800	964320	The phrase critical race theory has been tainted in this way, moving beyond the poisonous doctrine
964320	968300	of the original thing, and is now actually being used to refer to even just teaching
968300	970100	about the history of slavery in an appropriate way.
970100	971660	And yes, that's actually happening.
971660	974860	There are also right-oeds online saying that now that the pendulum is swinging once again,
974860	978780	they need to stop pretending that pornography counts as free speech and move to ban it.
978780	983540	And yes, McCarthy's wide anti-communist net catching legitimate non-communist also counts.
983540	987300	The most relevant example right now is the current groomer discourse, where the right
987300	991980	has finally found a label with both the sticking power and the inaccuracy of racist and fascist.
991980	996340	Yes, there are a lot of bad actors out there, a lot of real groomers, that video is coming
996340	997340	very soon.
997340	1001260	But for example, the teacher who is gay, who takes a few days off class to get married,
1001260	1005300	and then when asked about his wife by a student casually says that it's his husband actually,
1005300	1009180	that person isn't a groomer, and yet the outrage machine never ever sleeps.
1009180	1013620	We are moving into what I think is going to be a pretty dark time epistemologically speaking.
1013620	1017020	The left has been concept creeping its way across the intellectual landscape for over
1017020	1018020	a decade now.
1018020	1021300	And the right has basically just been holding their decks, impotently saying, hey, what
1021300	1022420	happened to tolerance?
1022420	1025220	Or what about the liberal idea of neutrality and openness?
1025220	1027460	And the right moves slow, but they do eventually move.
1027460	1030380	And they finally figured out that they're dealing with leftists, not liberals, that
1030380	1033300	the name of the game is concept creep for political benefit.
1033300	1034900	So now they're playing that game.
1034900	1036920	And look at the leftoids screech.
1036920	1041100	The sheer, unadulterated derangement of the groomer discourse is hard to overstate.
1041100	1042100	Shut the fuck up.
1042100	1046640	You retards have been baselessly calling everyone racist and Nazi since I was in high school.
1046640	1047640	I don't like this.
1047640	1048640	I don't support it.
1048640	1049640	But I understand it.
1049640	1050800	This is the world you built.
1050800	1051800	You started this.
1051800	1052800	You wanted this.
1052800	1055260	You were the ones who said that civility in politics was toxic.
1055260	1059100	You were the ones who said that the liberal idea of neutrality rested upon and implicitly
1059100	1062360	held up the white supremacist capitalist patriarchal structures.
1062440	1066320	You were the ones who infiltrated neutral institutions, changed definitions of words,
1066320	1070320	pushed politics into every corner of life, and violated every compromise with the right
1070320	1071720	that your predecessors struck.
1071720	1075640	The only reason that you expect the right to keep playing by the same set of liberal
1075640	1079140	rules that you yourself violate is because it would be good for you.
1079140	1082120	And the only reason that you're complaining that the right is doing what you've done
1082120	1084800	for years now is because it's going to be bad for you.
1084800	1086340	I don't like what's happening.
1086340	1089400	It's going to be terrible for us as a culture and a civilization.
1089400	1092320	But this is the bed that the left has made for itself.
1092320	1094240	Anyway, that's what concept creep is.
1094240	1097600	A psychological topic that's made its way into politics, and it accurately describes
1097600	1102280	the slow but steady corruption of various ideas into forms that explicitly benefit progressive
1102280	1103280	politics.
1103280	1106880	I was writing my Don't Say Gay video when I realized that over half of the video was
1106880	1111160	stuck describing what concept creep was, and then I also realized all of my other upcoming
1111160	1114440	videos relied on understanding of the topic, so I just cut the script off into its own
1114440	1115440	thing.
1115440	1118480	I hope you enjoyed it, and please keep in mind what I said here as we start exploring
1118480	1119960	some of the other topics in the future.
1119960	1121440	I will see you next time, guys.
1121440	1121940	I love you.
