{"text": " Good morning everyone welcome to this week's the weekly sip and in fact During the the premiere yesterday. There's a whole bunch of people saying where's the sip? Where's the sip? Well here it is Mmm Even got a bonus gulp in there. How'd you like that and it is a very good morning indeed how many of you guys are on the sfo discord because if you were I did a uh a morning wake-up call 5 a.m Everyone and hopefully your phone did not wake you with notifications Time to get up guys It uh, it seems that not too many people uh appreciated it Speaking of premieres. I'm only really using them for long-form videos like uh, like yesterday's don't have kids video All my short videos and the weekly sips and dumping with scrump And anything else that I decide to do will probably not see a premiere only the big ones will see one And I gotta say yesterday's video was uh quite divisive As it's still playing out in the comment section all the uh, all the arguments. That's good though. That's good There's a bunch of people who agree with my analysis. There's a bunch of people who think that I am just a fucking cuck And you know, that's fine But the best part about it is that we're talking about the subject We're talking about whether or not to have kids. We're actually talking about the contents of the christ church shooters manifesto We're not simply shutting off our brains and taking in the media narrative wholesale It's more important that we discuss and disagree Because the radical lefties in the media simply want us to shut off our brains and assume that it's all racist So keep talking guys Here's an article that I meant to actually put in yesterday's video, but I just couldn't find a way to uh to worm it in Thousands of dads are left in shock as do-it-yourself paternity tests soar. Oh Maybe there is something to the fact that everyone's fucking cheating nowadays Up to 30 000 tests are being performed every year the dna tests can be carried out with a simple cheek swab 20 of men will learn they are not the father of the child. They're testing one in five Sales of secret paternity tests are surging according to suppliers of do-it-yourself home kits The dna tests which can be carried out with simple cheek swabs are leading to growing numbers of men discovering They are not the biological father of children. They have been led to believe were theirs So guys how long until this is made illegal? Think about it for a minute on the argument that it's causing more and more men to Disassociate from their families drop their responsibilities to these kids and their mothers break up marriages Rather than actually blame the woman who cheated on the man How long until the people in power make some sort of a claim that children have the exclusive right to their genetic material? And that you can't steal it from them to do a test like this 20 of men will learn they're not the father In some regions the figure is higher including the northeast where it's 30 Holy fuck. Can you imagine that's almost one in three. Holy shit The explosion and demand for the test have been fueled by the ease with which definitive dna paternity results can now be obtained For about 99 pounds testing kits which promise 100 accurate next day results can be bought online Yeah, I think the era of mom's baby dad's maybe is is rapidly coming to an end to be honest I think that a paternity test should probably be mandatory at birth It's a trust but verify situation. I know the arguments against against not having the government involved But if it is say a legal statute that all kids have to be paternity tested at birth It removes the the awkwardness of it, you know, because let's say you're in a relationship and you have a suspicion That your girl might have been having kids with somebody else and you're the sucker But you have no proof you just have like a feeling And then you ask oh, hey, can we get this kid? Paternity tested they're going to instantly take that as an affront and you know if they're innocent Why wouldn't they from the point of view of the girl if you're innocent? If you have been faithful and your guy comes to you and asks for a paternity test that is a slap in the face There's no easy way to do this So if it becomes mandated Then it becomes a lot easier to do Of course, I don't think the government will ever actually mandate something like that because it goes against their interests Their interests are to keep family units complete are to keep men working And if necessary to keep child support payments flowing and if mandatory paternity testing disrupts that A government is not going to implement it as long as the man is named on the child's birth certificate or has parental responsibility No permission is required from either the mother or child meaning the test can be carried out in total secrecy That's going to change too. There's going to be a legal statute for that. They're going to be like no It's it's the mother's child. So the mother has the say in some u.s States concern over this has led to a recent ban on do-it-yourself home dna testing With all tests now having to be ordered by a doctor or court official and conducted under their supervision In britain, there is no such legislation currently be considered Yeah, see I didn't even read ahead in the article I already knew where they were going with it and that's where they went and of course whenever this topic comes up I am always reminded of this old article from 2010 Who's the daddy paternity can now be verified by a simple test, but it doesn't mean it should be it's a wise child They say that knows its own father nowadays wisdom is hardly required Dna tests can do the job with scientific certainty for the entire course of human history Men have nursed profound troubling doubts about the fundamental question of whether or not they were fathers to their own children women by contrast Usually enjoyed a reasonable level of certainty about the matter Now a cotton wool swab with a bit of saliva plus a small fee can settle the matter At a stroke the one thing that women had going with them has been taken away The one respect in which they had the last laugh over their husbands and lovers You can see how this person's a sociopath their husbands and lovers Last laugh does that really sound like the basis to have a long lasting functional stable relationship? Dna tests are an anti-feminist appliance of science Yeah Because they take away a woman's ability to cuck a man The subject has resurfaced lately because a married television presenter for who? Years had been paying for the support of a child conceived as he thought as a result of his relationship with a writer It seems that after meeting the child for the first time he asked for a dna test It duly turned out that he was not after all the father poor child Poor child. Yeah, you know what it is that that's true poor child, but also poor father or rather poor fooled father The children are the victim here, but they're not the victim of society. They're not the victim of the dna test They're the victim of their shitty mothers the next bridget jones movie may turn this under discussed issue into a talking point Bj becomes pregnant But she is not entirely sure by whom having been seeing the nice Colin firth boyfriend and the bad hugh grant one in pretty short order the matter could have been fruitfully ambiguous With bridget having a choice of fathers. No, no, no Are you actually saying that it's better if women can just choose the father of their baby? This is ridiculous This is insanity And apparently it's a sordid contemporary fashion for for them to get a dna test And so she found out the paternity of the baby in the most ancient game of humankind. Guess the daddy wasn't played anymore Yeah, and that is to our benefit You fucking sociopath The actor jude law recently found himself in just this position and unhesitatingly and ungallantly demanded a dna test It's it's ungallant to demand a dna test It's it's gallant to raise a child that's not yours I mean, I guess on some level it is like if you if you decide to take on that responsibility willingly that is a supreme sacrifice But nobody should be shamed for not wanting to fucking do it Uncertainty allows mothers to select for their children the father who would be best for them Because apparently the father's rights the father's life the father's feelings the father's finances just don't matter What matters is that as a male you were selected By the female and that is now what your life is about being selected by your betters In making paternity conditional on a test rather than the say-so of the mother it has removed from women a powerful instrument of choice That's because it should have never been your choice to begin with. Anyway, yeah this this melanie mcdonough She seems like a complete fucking piece of work. Let's stay in the uk for a little bit longer Nhs Transgender clinic accused of covering up negative impacts of puberty blockers on children by oxford professor I've always maintained that If you want to transition if you want to become a trans person or you want to you know, do whatever that's your right Obviously, obviously it's your right But you should also be properly informed about the medical risks and to say that oh, it's no big deal Snap your fingers become a woman snap your fingers become a man again. Don't worry about it But that's not how it works there are risks and costs involved and talking about them frankly is not gatekeeping At some point i'm going to have to do a video on on the transit situation And I think lillith is going to help me out with it We've been talking about it an oxford university professor has accused the nhs's only specialized clinic for transgender children Of suppressing negative results while undertaking experimental treatment on adolescents This is hideously unethical Suppress negative results as you test on children because you have an ideology you want to push They've been giving puberty blocking hormones to children without robust evidence as to the long-term effects They declared the trial a success and the clinic has continued to treat over a thousand children with hormones But dr Biggs's research suggests that after a year of treatment a significant increase was found in patients who have been born female Self-reporting to staff that they deliberately try to hurt or kill themselves and this is when you realize that the radical trans activists Don't actually care about trans people. They are actually quite anti-trans because they will push the trans acceptance agenda To the point that they have no problem with actual real trans people killing themselves The normalization of trans status in society is more important than keeping actual trans people alive According to these idiots puberty blockers exacerbated gender dysphoria Yet the study has been used to justify rolling out this drug regime to several hundred children aged under 16 Yeah, maybe you should be waiting till they hit 18 Maybe you should you should be waiting till they're fucking adults before you do anything this goddamn serious Let's shift gears a little bit a belief in meritocracy is not only false. It's bad for you Said by somebody who probably can't fucking compete Most people don't just think the world should be read meritocratically. They think it is meritocratic well On some level it is Think about it If everything was corrupt if all of our institutions were purely 100 corrupted Everything was just an eternal power struggle between the people at the top and the people at the bottom Why do things work? How come the power is on right now? How come I can record edit upload this video and you can watch it halfway across the world How come you can go to the grocery store and get food? How does the food get from farm to warehouse to store to your kitchen? I'm not saying that there's no corruption and i'm not saying that psychopaths don't occasionally enter into a system And hideously corrupt and destroy it that happens a lot But if you think that our society isn't at least partially meritocratic Then you have to be living in in some kind of isolated bubble meritocracy has become a leading social ideal Politicians across the ideological spectrum continually return to the theme that the rewards of life money power jobs university admission Should be distributed according to skill and effort. Yeah Yeah, that's how it should be You shouldn't get something for nothing Although widely held the belief that merit rather than luck determines success or failure in the world is demonstratively false This is not least because merit itself is in large part the result of luck Talent and the capacity for determined effort sometimes called grit depend a great deal on one's genetic endowments and upbringing Well, here's the problem with your argument, you know, it is the result of luck definitely But do you know what luck is luck is effort over time? That's really all it is Let's say you want to you know play in sports or something. All right, and from a young age You you practice and you're terrible at the sport of your choice But you practice every day you practice every day you practice you do get better you get better you get better After years after a decade of practice, you're you're pretty good at your sport. All right And then you get lucky your one shot comes along And because you have a decade of experience under your belt You've at least accumulated enough skill to take a decent chance at that shot Now if you didn't practice for that decade and the shot came along you would instantly blow it And here's how you can conceptualize it Every single day that you practiced And you didn't get lucky and and your shot didn't come along That was a failure in a sense. It wasn't a failure because you practice you gain skills you you broaden your horizon a little bit But it was a failure and that you didn't actually accomplish your long-term goal You had to wait you had to wait a decade's worth of days where you practice with no results That's what getting lucky is because all of us every single one of us every single human being on this planet will at some point Get lucky we will have a chance to do something that we love We will have a shot if you have prepared for your shot If you do the work when nobody else is watching then when you finally do get lucky you can take advantage of it So this person is right in that it is the result of luck This person is wrong because they don't know what luck is You'll notice that people who are exceptionally unlucky are also people who are exceptionally lazy Now one of those things the laziness or the luck didn't cause the other they're they're not correlated in that way But what happened was that when those people had their chances they had their shots They couldn't rise to the challenge in addition to being false A growing body of research and psychology and neuroscience suggests believing in meritocracy makes people more selfish less self-critical And even more prone to acting in discriminatory ways Meritocracy is not only wrong. It's bad I can see more selfish because if you have earned your success rightfully, you may want to hold on to it. That's understandable I don't see self. I don't see less self-critical because the most successful people are are very self-critical They're constantly reinventing themselves. They're constantly burning away the dead wood that exists inside of themselves There's no way that they're self. There's no way that they're less self-critical As for prone to acting in discriminatory ways See this person doesn't really Expand that idea in this article. What do you mean by discriminatory ways? Do you mean that they just become racists or sexist legitimately? They just view other groups as naturally inferior. That would be a problem If by discriminatory ways do they say things like well Maybe america's black community is doing poorly not because of racism But because fathers don't stick around to raise their kids and those kids grow up with fewer opportunities because That's true It also makes you a racist to say in today's climate But it is the heart of the problem at least in in terms of black america what this sounds like to me Is that meritocracy is not only wrong it's bad to this person because the lines of thinking that lead you to meritocracy Also lead you to realize that there are causes for the world's problems other than racism and sexism. Here's something really dumb Hawaii considers raising legal smoking age to a hundred years So you just want to just want to ban smoking in hawaii then basically You can have hundred year olds show up and smoke and that's about it Hawaii already has some of the toughest laws in cigarette sales But democrat politician richard kiegan who is a doctor believes more needs to be done to ban the deadliest artifact in human history to be fair, you know, um Like I wouldn't want smoking to be banned But I wouldn't necessarily fight for it too hard if it was like it was just out of my hands I wouldn't be like this is a travesty like smoking's pretty fucking bad It really is the the drug argument. I can see both sides right like should poison be legal Probably not you would not knowingly ingest radioactive isotopes or some bullshit right at the same time should people be allowed to Get high at the expense of their own health Yeah, probably and you know cigarettes and alcohol provide a very a very tame sort of high in comparison to marijuana and in comparison to harder drugs but It is ultimately a victimless crime, isn't it? The person's choosing to do it to themselves so I can see both arguments and because I don't smoke. I don't drink I don't use drugs and i've never felt any serious push to do any of those things I personally do not care about this conversation But this is one of the but this is one of the times where the arguments are very evenly balanced because on the one hand You know There's the arguments against the nanny state The state of hawaii has no place telling their citizens whether they can smoke or not A legal age of 100 is ridiculous because people past 21 are adults in the states on the other hand cigarettes Are and they produce toxic substances and we often regulate toxic substances While I can understand both arguments if I really had to choose one I would I would ultimately fall on the side of letting people do what they like even if that's completely self-destructive You know as long as they're not destroying somebody else on their downward spiral, you know, I I don't really care Let's end off with something stupid Cher calls for laws to control men's bodies. They must be circumcised and show papers or penis Cher Cher I'm reasonably sure that over 50 percent of your body is artificial You have no place to be talking about whether or not men's bodies are natural here Let's read her ridiculous tweets Republicans believe they've got god-given right to dictate what we do with our bodies Women must make laws to control men's bodies. No viagra rogane or testosterone how transphobic of you All men must be circumcised and show papers or penis to prove it Massage parlors punishable by death men must take the pill What You mean like estrogen? Do you I don't know exactly what you mean by the pill Cher I think you might have gone off the fucking deep end here lady. Why is trump always pr man for villains? Why does he kowtow kiss ass of dictators child molesters murderers wife beaters? anti-semites white supremacists hater of any skin not lily white Why he's sick with envy he wants to be a king, but how can he care nothing for auto warm be? What? Cher I think it's time for you to retire You're like you're going off the deep end in your old age Anyway, I am out of here. Thank you very much guys.
