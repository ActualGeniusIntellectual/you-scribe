00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Good morning everyone welcome to this week's the weekly sip and in fact

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,640
During the the premiere yesterday. There's a whole bunch of people saying where's the sip? Where's the sip? Well here it is

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,600
Mmm

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,440
Even got a bonus gulp in there. How'd you like that and it is a very good morning indeed

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,000
how many of you guys are on the sfo discord because if you were

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,920
I did a uh a morning wake-up call 5 a.m

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,460
Everyone and hopefully your phone did not wake you with notifications

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,920
Time to get up guys

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,680
It uh, it seems that not too many people uh appreciated it

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:51,280
Speaking of premieres. I'm only really using them for long-form videos like uh, like yesterday's don't have kids video

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,360
All my short videos and the weekly sips and dumping with scrump

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,520
And anything else that I decide to do will probably not see a premiere only the big ones will see one

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,380
And I gotta say yesterday's video was uh quite divisive

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,200
As it's still playing out in the comment section all the uh, all the arguments. That's good though. That's good

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,320
There's a bunch of people who agree with my analysis. There's a bunch of people who think that I am just a fucking cuck

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,880
And you know, that's fine

17
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,920
But the best part about it is that we're talking about the subject

18
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,980
We're talking about whether or not to have kids. We're actually talking about the contents of the christ church shooters manifesto

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,080
We're not simply shutting off our brains and taking in the media narrative wholesale

20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,900
It's more important that we discuss and disagree

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,720
Because the radical lefties in the media simply want us to shut off our brains and assume that it's all racist

22
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,320
So keep talking guys

23
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,560
Here's an article that I meant to actually put in yesterday's video, but I just couldn't find a way to uh to worm it in

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,200
Thousands of dads are left in shock as do-it-yourself paternity tests soar. Oh

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,760
Maybe there is something to the fact that everyone's fucking cheating nowadays

26
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,640
Up to 30 000 tests are being performed every year the dna tests can be carried out with a simple cheek swab

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,720
20 of men will learn they are not the father of the child. They're testing one in five

28
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,560
Sales of secret paternity tests are surging according to suppliers of do-it-yourself home kits

29
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,640
The dna tests which can be carried out with simple cheek swabs are leading to growing numbers of men discovering

30
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,400
They are not the biological father of children. They have been led to believe were theirs

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,840
So guys how long until this is made illegal?

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,800
Think about it for a minute on the argument that it's causing more and more men to

33
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:46,480
Disassociate from their families drop their responsibilities to these kids and their mothers break up marriages

34
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,600
Rather than actually blame the woman who cheated on the man

35
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,860
How long until the people in power make some sort of a claim that children have the exclusive right to their genetic material?

36
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,760
And that you can't steal it from them to do a test like this 20 of men will learn they're not the father

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,920
In some regions the figure is higher including the northeast where it's 30

38
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,000
Holy fuck. Can you imagine that's almost one in three. Holy shit

39
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,880
The explosion and demand for the test have been fueled by the ease with which definitive dna paternity results can now be obtained

40
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,360
For about 99 pounds testing kits which promise 100 accurate next day results can be bought online

41
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,520
Yeah, I think the era of mom's baby dad's maybe is is rapidly coming to an end to be honest

42
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,840
I think that a paternity test should probably be mandatory at birth

43
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,080
It's a trust but verify situation. I know the arguments against against not having the government involved

44
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,600
But if it is say a legal statute that all kids have to be paternity tested at birth

45
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,260
It removes the the awkwardness of it, you know, because let's say you're in a relationship and you have a suspicion

46
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,360
That your girl might have been having kids with somebody else and you're the sucker

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But you have no proof you just have like a feeling

48
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,040
And then you ask oh, hey, can we get this kid?

49
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,600
Paternity tested they're going to instantly take that as an affront and you know if they're innocent

50
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,400
Why wouldn't they from the point of view of the girl if you're innocent?

51
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,440
If you have been faithful and your guy comes to you and asks for a paternity test that is a slap in the face

52
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,720
There's no easy way to do this

53
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,960
So if it becomes mandated

54
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,360
Then it becomes a lot easier to do

55
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,640
Of course, I don't think the government will ever actually mandate something like that because it goes against their interests

56
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,120
Their interests are to keep family units complete are to keep men working

57
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,760
And if necessary to keep child support payments flowing and if mandatory paternity testing disrupts that

58
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,180
A government is not going to implement it as long as the man is named on the child's birth certificate or has parental responsibility

59
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,820
No permission is required from either the mother or child meaning the test can be carried out in total secrecy

60
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,740
That's going to change too. There's going to be a legal statute for that. They're going to be like no

61
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,500
It's it's the mother's child. So the mother has the say in some u.s

62
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,620
States concern over this has led to a recent ban on do-it-yourself home dna testing

63
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,240
With all tests now having to be ordered by a doctor or court official and conducted under their supervision

64
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,060
In britain, there is no such legislation currently be considered

65
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,580
Yeah, see I didn't even read ahead in the article

66
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,620
I already knew where they were going with it and that's where they went and of course whenever this topic comes up

67
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,560
I am always reminded of this old article from 2010

68
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:34,500
Who's the daddy paternity can now be verified by a simple test, but it doesn't mean it should be it's a wise child

69
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,500
They say that knows its own father nowadays wisdom is hardly required

70
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,860
Dna tests can do the job with scientific certainty for the entire course of human history

71
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:50,020
Men have nursed profound troubling doubts about the fundamental question of whether or not they were fathers to their own children

72
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,260
women by contrast

73
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,460
Usually enjoyed a reasonable level of certainty about the matter

74
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,780
Now a cotton wool swab with a bit of saliva plus a small fee can settle the matter

75
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,940
At a stroke the one thing that women had going with them has been taken away

76
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,420
The one respect in which they had the last laugh over their husbands and lovers

77
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,820
You can see how this person's a sociopath their husbands and lovers

78
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,960
Last laugh does that really sound like the basis to have a long lasting functional stable relationship?

79
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,180
Dna tests are an anti-feminist appliance of science

80
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,300
Yeah

81
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,500
Because they take away a woman's ability to cuck a man

82
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,300
The subject has resurfaced lately because a married television presenter for who?

83
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:42,100
Years had been paying for the support of a child conceived as he thought as a result of his relationship with a writer

84
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,420
It seems that after meeting the child for the first time he asked for a dna test

85
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,060
It duly turned out that he was not after all the father poor child

86
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:59,460
Poor child. Yeah, you know what it is that that's true poor child, but also poor father or rather poor fooled father

87
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,300
The children are the victim here, but they're not the victim of society. They're not the victim of the dna test

88
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:12,180
They're the victim of their shitty mothers the next bridget jones movie may turn this under discussed issue into a talking point

89
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,260
Bj becomes pregnant

90
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,700
But she is not entirely sure by whom having been seeing the nice

91
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:23,560
Colin firth boyfriend and the bad hugh grant one in pretty short order the matter could have been fruitfully ambiguous

92
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,060
With bridget having a choice of fathers. No, no, no

93
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,860
Are you actually saying that it's better if women can just choose the father of their baby?

94
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,900
This is ridiculous

95
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,900
This is insanity

96
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:42,340
And apparently it's a sordid contemporary fashion for for them to get a dna test

97
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,820
And so she found out the paternity of the baby in the most ancient game of humankind. Guess the daddy wasn't played anymore

98
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,300
Yeah, and that is to our benefit

99
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,940
You fucking sociopath

100
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:01,220
The actor jude law recently found himself in just this position and unhesitatingly and ungallantly demanded a dna test

101
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,180
It's it's ungallant to demand a dna test

102
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,380
It's it's gallant to raise a child that's not yours

103
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:15,400
I mean, I guess on some level it is like if you if you decide to take on that responsibility willingly that is a supreme sacrifice

104
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,700
But nobody should be shamed for not wanting to fucking do it

105
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,580
Uncertainty allows mothers to select for their children the father who would be best for them

106
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:31,780
Because apparently the father's rights the father's life the father's feelings the father's finances just don't matter

107
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,880
What matters is that as a male you were selected

108
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,060
By the female and that is now what your life is about being selected by your betters

109
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:48,740
In making paternity conditional on a test rather than the say-so of the mother it has removed from women a powerful instrument of choice

110
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,580
That's because it should have never been your choice to begin with. Anyway, yeah this this melanie mcdonough

111
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,220
She seems like a complete fucking piece of work. Let's stay in the uk for a little bit longer

112
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,280
Nhs

113
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:07,860
Transgender clinic accused of covering up negative impacts of puberty blockers on children by oxford professor

114
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,020
I've always maintained that

115
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:15,220
If you want to transition if you want to become a trans person or you want to you know, do whatever that's your right

116
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,300
Obviously, obviously it's your right

117
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,140
But you should also be properly informed about the medical risks and to say that oh, it's no big deal

118
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,620
Snap your fingers become a woman snap your fingers become a man again. Don't worry about it

119
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:35,560
But that's not how it works there are risks and costs involved and talking about them frankly is not gatekeeping

120
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,460
At some point i'm going to have to do a video on on the transit situation

121
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,300
And I think lillith is going to help me out with it

122
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:47,940
We've been talking about it an oxford university professor has accused the nhs's only specialized clinic for transgender children

123
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,120
Of suppressing negative results while undertaking experimental treatment on adolescents

124
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,640
This is hideously unethical

125
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,720
Suppress negative results as you test on children because you have an ideology you want to push

126
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:07,400
They've been giving puberty blocking hormones to children without robust evidence as to the long-term effects

127
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:13,000
They declared the trial a success and the clinic has continued to treat over a thousand children with hormones

128
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,880
But dr

129
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:20,680
Biggs's research suggests that after a year of treatment a significant increase was found in patients who have been born female

130
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:27,740
Self-reporting to staff that they deliberately try to hurt or kill themselves and this is when you realize that the radical trans activists

131
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:36,520
Don't actually care about trans people. They are actually quite anti-trans because they will push the trans acceptance agenda

132
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,780
To the point that they have no problem with actual real trans people killing themselves

133
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,480
The normalization of trans status in society is more important than keeping actual trans people alive

134
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,540
According to these idiots puberty blockers exacerbated gender dysphoria

135
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,920
Yet the study has been used to justify rolling out this drug regime to several hundred children aged under 16

136
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,320
Yeah, maybe you should be waiting till they hit 18

137
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,000
Maybe you should you should be waiting till they're fucking adults before you do anything this goddamn serious

138
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,760
Let's shift gears a little bit a belief in meritocracy is not only false. It's bad for you

139
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,160
Said by somebody who probably can't fucking compete

140
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,620
Most people don't just think the world should be read meritocratically. They think it is meritocratic

141
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,520
well

142
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,440
On some level it is

143
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,440
Think about it

144
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,800
If everything was corrupt if all of our institutions were purely 100 corrupted

145
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,280
Everything was just an eternal power struggle between the people at the top and the people at the bottom

146
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,520
Why do things work?

147
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,120
How come the power is on right now?

148
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,120
How come I can record edit upload this video and you can watch it halfway across the world

149
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,080
How come you can go to the grocery store and get food?

150
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,800
How does the food get from farm to warehouse to store to your kitchen?

151
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,400
I'm not saying that there's no corruption and i'm not saying that psychopaths don't occasionally enter into a system

152
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,080
And hideously corrupt and destroy it that happens a lot

153
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,940
But if you think that our society isn't at least partially meritocratic

154
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,920
Then you have to be living in in some kind of isolated bubble meritocracy has become a leading social ideal

155
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:22,600
Politicians across the ideological spectrum continually return to the theme that the rewards of life money power jobs university admission

156
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,960
Should be distributed according to skill and effort. Yeah

157
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,040
Yeah, that's how it should be

158
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,800
You shouldn't get something for nothing

159
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:36,440
Although widely held the belief that merit rather than luck determines success or failure in the world is demonstratively false

160
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,240
This is not least because merit itself is in large part the result of luck

161
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:48,920
Talent and the capacity for determined effort sometimes called grit depend a great deal on one's genetic endowments and upbringing

162
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,720
Well, here's the problem with your argument, you know, it is the result of luck definitely

163
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,880
But do you know what luck is luck is effort over time?

164
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,440
That's really all it is

165
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,840
Let's say you want to you know play in sports or something. All right, and from a young age

166
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,600
You you practice and you're terrible at the sport of your choice

167
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,720
But you practice every day you practice every day you practice you do get better you get better you get better

168
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,440
After years after a decade of practice, you're you're pretty good at your sport. All right

169
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,720
And then you get lucky your one shot comes along

170
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,400
And because you have a decade of experience under your belt

171
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,320
You've at least accumulated enough skill to take a decent chance at that shot

172
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,640
Now if you didn't practice for that decade and the shot came along you would instantly blow it

173
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,080
And here's how you can conceptualize it

174
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Every single day that you practiced

175
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,400
And you didn't get lucky and and your shot didn't come along

176
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:55,400
That was a failure in a sense. It wasn't a failure because you practice you gain skills you you broaden your horizon a little bit

177
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,880
But it was a failure and that you didn't actually accomplish your long-term goal

178
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,560
You had to wait you had to wait a decade's worth of days where you practice with no results

179
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:16,360
That's what getting lucky is because all of us every single one of us every single human being on this planet will at some point

180
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,080
Get lucky we will have a chance to do something that we love

181
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,840
We will have a shot if you have prepared for your shot

182
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:31,720
If you do the work when nobody else is watching then when you finally do get lucky you can take advantage of it

183
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,560
So this person is right in that it is the result of luck

184
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,080
This person is wrong because they don't know what luck is

185
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:45,560
You'll notice that people who are exceptionally unlucky are also people who are exceptionally lazy

186
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:51,480
Now one of those things the laziness or the luck didn't cause the other they're they're not correlated in that way

187
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,720
But what happened was that when those people had their chances they had their shots

188
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,720
They couldn't rise to the challenge in addition to being false

189
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:07,900
A growing body of research and psychology and neuroscience suggests believing in meritocracy makes people more selfish less self-critical

190
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,240
And even more prone to acting in discriminatory ways

191
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,520
Meritocracy is not only wrong. It's bad

192
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:22,060
I can see more selfish because if you have earned your success rightfully, you may want to hold on to it. That's understandable

193
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,160
I don't see self. I don't see less self-critical because the most successful people are are very self-critical

194
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:36,060
They're constantly reinventing themselves. They're constantly burning away the dead wood that exists inside of themselves

195
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,540
There's no way that they're self. There's no way that they're less self-critical

196
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,280
As for prone to acting in discriminatory ways

197
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
See this person doesn't really

198
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,320
Expand that idea in this article. What do you mean by discriminatory ways?

199
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:59,080
Do you mean that they just become racists or sexist legitimately? They just view other groups as naturally inferior. That would be a problem

200
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,080
If by discriminatory ways do they say things like well

201
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,040
Maybe america's black community is doing poorly not because of racism

202
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,700
But because fathers don't stick around to raise their kids and those kids grow up with fewer opportunities

203
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,760
because

204
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,040
That's true

205
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,240
It also makes you a racist to say in today's climate

206
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,080
But it is the heart of the problem at least in in terms of black america what this sounds like to me

207
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:32,060
Is that meritocracy is not only wrong it's bad to this person because the lines of thinking that lead you to meritocracy

208
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Also lead you to realize that there are causes for the world's problems other than racism and sexism. Here's something really dumb

209
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,520
Hawaii considers raising legal smoking age to a hundred years

210
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,400
So you just want to just want to ban smoking in hawaii then basically

211
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,200
You can have hundred year olds show up and smoke and that's about it

212
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,160
Hawaii already has some of the toughest laws in cigarette sales

213
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,720
But democrat politician richard kiegan who is a doctor believes more needs to be done to ban the deadliest artifact in human history

214
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,440
to be fair, you know, um

215
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,080
Like I wouldn't want smoking to be banned

216
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,960
But I wouldn't necessarily fight for it too hard if it was like it was just out of my hands

217
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,760
I wouldn't be like this is a travesty like smoking's pretty fucking bad

218
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,520
It really is the the drug argument. I can see both sides right like should poison be legal

219
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:29,320
Probably not you would not knowingly ingest radioactive isotopes or some bullshit right at the same time should people be allowed to

220
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,200
Get high at the expense of their own health

221
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,680
Yeah, probably

222
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:41,160
and you know cigarettes and alcohol provide a very a very tame sort of high in comparison to marijuana and in comparison to

223
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,000
harder drugs

224
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,280
but

225
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,520
It is ultimately a victimless crime, isn't it?

226
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,760
The person's choosing to do it to themselves so I can see both arguments

227
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,840
and because

228
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,840
I don't smoke. I don't drink

229
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,400
I don't use drugs and i've never felt any serious push to do any of those things

230
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,280
I personally do not care about this conversation

231
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,880
But this is one of the but this is one of the times where the arguments are very evenly balanced because on the one hand

232
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:08,680
You know

233
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
There's the arguments against the nanny state

234
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,520
The state of hawaii has no place telling their citizens whether they can smoke or not

235
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:21,800
A legal age of 100 is ridiculous because people past 21 are adults in the states on the other hand cigarettes

236
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,900
Are and they produce toxic substances and we often regulate toxic substances

237
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,560
While I can understand both arguments if I really had to choose one

238
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,820
I would I would ultimately fall on the side of letting people do what they like even if that's completely self-destructive

239
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:44,540
You know as long as they're not destroying somebody else on their downward spiral, you know, I I don't really care

240
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,940
Let's end off with something stupid

241
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:52,700
Cher calls for laws to control men's bodies. They must be circumcised and show papers or penis

242
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,140
Cher

243
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,660
Cher

244
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,140
I'm reasonably sure that over 50 percent of your body is artificial

245
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:07,180
You have no place to be talking about whether or not men's bodies are natural here

246
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,180
Let's read her ridiculous tweets

247
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,500
Republicans believe they've got god-given right to dictate what we do with our bodies

248
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:20,460
Women must make laws to control men's bodies. No viagra rogane or testosterone how transphobic of you

249
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,940
All men must be circumcised and show papers or penis to prove it

250
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,900
Massage parlors punishable by death men must take the pill

251
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,700
What

252
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,700
You mean like estrogen?

253
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,060
Do you I don't know exactly what you mean by the pill

254
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:44,540
Cher I think you might have gone off the fucking deep end here lady. Why is trump always pr man for villains?

255
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,740
Why does he kowtow kiss ass of dictators child molesters murderers wife beaters?

256
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,060
anti-semites white supremacists hater of any skin not lily white

257
00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:01,180
Why he's sick with envy he wants to be a king, but how can he care nothing for auto warm be?

258
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,220
What?

259
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,220
Cher

260
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,100
I think it's time for you to retire

261
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,060
You're like you're going off the deep end in your old age

262
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:20,060
Anyway, I am out of here. Thank you very much guys. Thank you very much for watching this video. Thank you very much before

263
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:27,020
Watching yesterday's premiere. I am for the most part back on track again and doing regular videos

264
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,860
I appreciate your support on subscribe star because ever since I did the patreon is dying

265
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:38,860
You know sargon's last laugh video my subscribe star support has has rapidly bumped up

266
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:45,660
We are about one third of the way on subscribe star to me being able to comfortably live on this channel and continue to upgrade

267
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,580
My equipment so thank you very much for all of your support. It's quite incredible

268
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:56,000
If you're interested in this sort of thing, I will be streaming mass effect 2 tonight with my girlfriend

269
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,460
We're continuing our playthrough through the entire series. She's never played it before

270
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,940
Doing that on twitch.tv

271
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,540
Slash game boomers tonight and as always because I am doing the content creation thing full time

00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,260
Now I stream my video games on twitch every night

273
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,100
I'm a variety streamer. So just drop in whenever you see a game that you like

274
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:20,940
I don't know if dnd is on this week. Sargon's really really dragging his butt about it

275
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,980
Let's hope it is it's been like five fucking weeks

276
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,700
So whether you're catching me on discord seeing me on twitch or checking out my videos
