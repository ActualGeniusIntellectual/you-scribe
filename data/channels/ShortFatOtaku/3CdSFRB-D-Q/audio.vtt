00:00.000 --> 00:05.520
Good morning everyone welcome to this week's the weekly sip and in fact

00:06.000 --> 00:12.640
During the the premiere yesterday. There's a whole bunch of people saying where's the sip? Where's the sip? Well here it is

00:17.600 --> 00:19.600
Mmm

00:19.600 --> 00:25.440
Even got a bonus gulp in there. How'd you like that and it is a very good morning indeed

00:25.440 --> 00:30.000
how many of you guys are on the sfo discord because if you were

00:30.720 --> 00:33.920
I did a uh a morning wake-up call 5 a.m

00:34.240 --> 00:37.460
Everyone and hopefully your phone did not wake you with notifications

00:38.160 --> 00:39.920
Time to get up guys

00:39.920 --> 00:43.680
It uh, it seems that not too many people uh appreciated it

00:44.560 --> 00:51.280
Speaking of premieres. I'm only really using them for long-form videos like uh, like yesterday's don't have kids video

00:52.160 --> 00:55.360
All my short videos and the weekly sips and dumping with scrump

00:55.920 --> 01:01.520
And anything else that I decide to do will probably not see a premiere only the big ones will see one

01:01.920 --> 01:05.380
And I gotta say yesterday's video was uh quite divisive

01:06.240 --> 01:11.200
As it's still playing out in the comment section all the uh, all the arguments. That's good though. That's good

01:11.440 --> 01:16.320
There's a bunch of people who agree with my analysis. There's a bunch of people who think that I am just a fucking cuck

01:16.880 --> 01:18.880
And you know, that's fine

01:18.960 --> 01:21.920
But the best part about it is that we're talking about the subject

01:22.880 --> 01:28.980
We're talking about whether or not to have kids. We're actually talking about the contents of the christ church shooters manifesto

01:29.200 --> 01:34.080
We're not simply shutting off our brains and taking in the media narrative wholesale

01:34.320 --> 01:36.900
It's more important that we discuss and disagree

01:37.200 --> 01:42.720
Because the radical lefties in the media simply want us to shut off our brains and assume that it's all racist

01:43.040 --> 01:44.320
So keep talking guys

01:44.320 --> 01:50.560
Here's an article that I meant to actually put in yesterday's video, but I just couldn't find a way to uh to worm it in

01:51.680 --> 01:57.200
Thousands of dads are left in shock as do-it-yourself paternity tests soar. Oh

01:58.080 --> 02:01.760
Maybe there is something to the fact that everyone's fucking cheating nowadays

02:03.280 --> 02:08.640
Up to 30 000 tests are being performed every year the dna tests can be carried out with a simple cheek swab

02:09.360 --> 02:14.720
20 of men will learn they are not the father of the child. They're testing one in five

02:15.520 --> 02:20.560
Sales of secret paternity tests are surging according to suppliers of do-it-yourself home kits

02:21.440 --> 02:26.640
The dna tests which can be carried out with simple cheek swabs are leading to growing numbers of men discovering

02:26.640 --> 02:30.400
They are not the biological father of children. They have been led to believe were theirs

02:31.120 --> 02:33.840
So guys how long until this is made illegal?

02:34.400 --> 02:38.800
Think about it for a minute on the argument that it's causing more and more men to

02:39.580 --> 02:46.480
Disassociate from their families drop their responsibilities to these kids and their mothers break up marriages

02:46.720 --> 02:49.600
Rather than actually blame the woman who cheated on the man

02:50.080 --> 02:55.860
How long until the people in power make some sort of a claim that children have the exclusive right to their genetic material?

02:56.080 --> 03:01.760
And that you can't steal it from them to do a test like this 20 of men will learn they're not the father

03:02.560 --> 03:05.920
In some regions the figure is higher including the northeast where it's 30

03:06.640 --> 03:10.000
Holy fuck. Can you imagine that's almost one in three. Holy shit

03:10.400 --> 03:16.880
The explosion and demand for the test have been fueled by the ease with which definitive dna paternity results can now be obtained

03:17.440 --> 03:23.360
For about 99 pounds testing kits which promise 100 accurate next day results can be bought online

03:23.840 --> 03:29.520
Yeah, I think the era of mom's baby dad's maybe is is rapidly coming to an end to be honest

03:29.520 --> 03:33.840
I think that a paternity test should probably be mandatory at birth

03:34.320 --> 03:40.080
It's a trust but verify situation. I know the arguments against against not having the government involved

03:40.240 --> 03:45.600
But if it is say a legal statute that all kids have to be paternity tested at birth

03:46.080 --> 03:52.260
It removes the the awkwardness of it, you know, because let's say you're in a relationship and you have a suspicion

03:53.200 --> 03:57.360
That your girl might have been having kids with somebody else and you're the sucker

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
But you have no proof you just have like a feeling

04:00.880 --> 04:03.040
And then you ask oh, hey, can we get this kid?

04:03.500 --> 04:07.600
Paternity tested they're going to instantly take that as an affront and you know if they're innocent

04:07.600 --> 04:10.400
Why wouldn't they from the point of view of the girl if you're innocent?

04:10.480 --> 04:15.440
If you have been faithful and your guy comes to you and asks for a paternity test that is a slap in the face

04:16.720 --> 04:18.720
There's no easy way to do this

04:18.960 --> 04:20.960
So if it becomes mandated

04:21.360 --> 04:23.360
Then it becomes a lot easier to do

04:23.520 --> 04:28.640
Of course, I don't think the government will ever actually mandate something like that because it goes against their interests

04:29.040 --> 04:33.120
Their interests are to keep family units complete are to keep men working

04:34.080 --> 04:39.760
And if necessary to keep child support payments flowing and if mandatory paternity testing disrupts that

04:40.240 --> 04:46.180
A government is not going to implement it as long as the man is named on the child's birth certificate or has parental responsibility

04:46.800 --> 04:52.820
No permission is required from either the mother or child meaning the test can be carried out in total secrecy

04:53.220 --> 04:56.740
That's going to change too. There's going to be a legal statute for that. They're going to be like no

04:56.820 --> 05:00.500
It's it's the mother's child. So the mother has the say in some u.s

05:00.580 --> 05:05.620
States concern over this has led to a recent ban on do-it-yourself home dna testing

05:05.940 --> 05:11.240
With all tests now having to be ordered by a doctor or court official and conducted under their supervision

05:12.100 --> 05:15.060
In britain, there is no such legislation currently be considered

05:15.940 --> 05:18.580
Yeah, see I didn't even read ahead in the article

05:18.580 --> 05:23.620
I already knew where they were going with it and that's where they went and of course whenever this topic comes up

05:23.780 --> 05:27.560
I am always reminded of this old article from 2010

05:28.020 --> 05:34.500
Who's the daddy paternity can now be verified by a simple test, but it doesn't mean it should be it's a wise child

05:34.500 --> 05:38.500
They say that knows its own father nowadays wisdom is hardly required

05:38.900 --> 05:43.860
Dna tests can do the job with scientific certainty for the entire course of human history

05:44.180 --> 05:50.020
Men have nursed profound troubling doubts about the fundamental question of whether or not they were fathers to their own children

05:50.660 --> 05:52.260
women by contrast

05:52.260 --> 05:55.460
Usually enjoyed a reasonable level of certainty about the matter

05:55.780 --> 05:59.780
Now a cotton wool swab with a bit of saliva plus a small fee can settle the matter

06:00.340 --> 06:03.940
At a stroke the one thing that women had going with them has been taken away

06:04.340 --> 06:08.420
The one respect in which they had the last laugh over their husbands and lovers

06:09.220 --> 06:12.820
You can see how this person's a sociopath their husbands and lovers

06:13.700 --> 06:19.960
Last laugh does that really sound like the basis to have a long lasting functional stable relationship?

06:20.420 --> 06:24.180
Dna tests are an anti-feminist appliance of science

06:25.780 --> 06:27.300
Yeah

06:27.300 --> 06:30.500
Because they take away a woman's ability to cuck a man

06:31.060 --> 06:35.300
The subject has resurfaced lately because a married television presenter for who?

06:35.540 --> 06:42.100
Years had been paying for the support of a child conceived as he thought as a result of his relationship with a writer

06:42.900 --> 06:46.420
It seems that after meeting the child for the first time he asked for a dna test

06:47.060 --> 06:51.060
It duly turned out that he was not after all the father poor child

06:51.620 --> 06:59.460
Poor child. Yeah, you know what it is that that's true poor child, but also poor father or rather poor fooled father

07:00.180 --> 07:05.300
The children are the victim here, but they're not the victim of society. They're not the victim of the dna test

07:05.620 --> 07:12.180
They're the victim of their shitty mothers the next bridget jones movie may turn this under discussed issue into a talking point

07:12.820 --> 07:14.260
Bj becomes pregnant

07:14.260 --> 07:17.700
But she is not entirely sure by whom having been seeing the nice

07:17.860 --> 07:23.560
Colin firth boyfriend and the bad hugh grant one in pretty short order the matter could have been fruitfully ambiguous

07:23.860 --> 07:27.060
With bridget having a choice of fathers. No, no, no

07:27.780 --> 07:31.860
Are you actually saying that it's better if women can just choose the father of their baby?

07:33.220 --> 07:34.900
This is ridiculous

07:34.900 --> 07:36.900
This is insanity

07:37.140 --> 07:42.340
And apparently it's a sordid contemporary fashion for for them to get a dna test

07:43.140 --> 07:48.820
And so she found out the paternity of the baby in the most ancient game of humankind. Guess the daddy wasn't played anymore

07:49.300 --> 07:51.300
Yeah, and that is to our benefit

07:51.940 --> 07:53.940
You fucking sociopath

07:53.940 --> 08:01.220
The actor jude law recently found himself in just this position and unhesitatingly and ungallantly demanded a dna test

08:01.700 --> 08:04.180
It's it's ungallant to demand a dna test

08:04.660 --> 08:07.380
It's it's gallant to raise a child that's not yours

08:08.180 --> 08:15.400
I mean, I guess on some level it is like if you if you decide to take on that responsibility willingly that is a supreme sacrifice

08:16.260 --> 08:19.700
But nobody should be shamed for not wanting to fucking do it

08:20.400 --> 08:24.580
Uncertainty allows mothers to select for their children the father who would be best for them

08:25.780 --> 08:31.780
Because apparently the father's rights the father's life the father's feelings the father's finances just don't matter

08:32.580 --> 08:35.880
What matters is that as a male you were selected

08:36.500 --> 08:41.060
By the female and that is now what your life is about being selected by your betters

08:41.700 --> 08:48.740
In making paternity conditional on a test rather than the say-so of the mother it has removed from women a powerful instrument of choice

08:49.700 --> 08:54.580
That's because it should have never been your choice to begin with. Anyway, yeah this this melanie mcdonough

08:54.980 --> 08:59.220
She seems like a complete fucking piece of work. Let's stay in the uk for a little bit longer

09:00.020 --> 09:01.280
Nhs

09:01.280 --> 09:07.860
Transgender clinic accused of covering up negative impacts of puberty blockers on children by oxford professor

09:08.260 --> 09:10.020
I've always maintained that

09:10.020 --> 09:15.220
If you want to transition if you want to become a trans person or you want to you know, do whatever that's your right

09:15.300 --> 09:17.300
Obviously, obviously it's your right

09:17.700 --> 09:23.140
But you should also be properly informed about the medical risks and to say that oh, it's no big deal

09:23.380 --> 09:27.620
Snap your fingers become a woman snap your fingers become a man again. Don't worry about it

09:28.340 --> 09:35.560
But that's not how it works there are risks and costs involved and talking about them frankly is not gatekeeping

09:36.180 --> 09:39.460
At some point i'm going to have to do a video on on the transit situation

09:39.540 --> 09:41.300
And I think lillith is going to help me out with it

09:41.300 --> 09:47.940
We've been talking about it an oxford university professor has accused the nhs's only specialized clinic for transgender children

09:48.260 --> 09:52.120
Of suppressing negative results while undertaking experimental treatment on adolescents

09:53.140 --> 09:55.640
This is hideously unethical

09:56.520 --> 10:01.720
Suppress negative results as you test on children because you have an ideology you want to push

10:01.960 --> 10:07.400
They've been giving puberty blocking hormones to children without robust evidence as to the long-term effects

10:07.560 --> 10:13.000
They declared the trial a success and the clinic has continued to treat over a thousand children with hormones

10:13.320 --> 10:13.880
But dr

10:13.880 --> 10:20.680
Biggs's research suggests that after a year of treatment a significant increase was found in patients who have been born female

10:21.080 --> 10:27.740
Self-reporting to staff that they deliberately try to hurt or kill themselves and this is when you realize that the radical trans activists

10:28.520 --> 10:36.520
Don't actually care about trans people. They are actually quite anti-trans because they will push the trans acceptance agenda

10:37.320 --> 10:42.780
To the point that they have no problem with actual real trans people killing themselves

10:43.160 --> 10:49.480
The normalization of trans status in society is more important than keeping actual trans people alive

10:50.120 --> 10:54.540
According to these idiots puberty blockers exacerbated gender dysphoria

10:55.000 --> 11:00.920
Yet the study has been used to justify rolling out this drug regime to several hundred children aged under 16

11:01.320 --> 11:03.320
Yeah, maybe you should be waiting till they hit 18

11:04.040 --> 11:09.000
Maybe you should you should be waiting till they're fucking adults before you do anything this goddamn serious

11:09.320 --> 11:14.760
Let's shift gears a little bit a belief in meritocracy is not only false. It's bad for you

11:16.440 --> 11:19.160
Said by somebody who probably can't fucking compete

11:19.640 --> 11:24.620
Most people don't just think the world should be read meritocratically. They think it is meritocratic

11:25.480 --> 11:26.520
well

11:26.520 --> 11:28.440
On some level it is

11:28.440 --> 11:30.440
Think about it

11:30.600 --> 11:35.800
If everything was corrupt if all of our institutions were purely 100 corrupted

11:36.200 --> 11:40.280
Everything was just an eternal power struggle between the people at the top and the people at the bottom

11:40.920 --> 11:42.520
Why do things work?

11:42.520 --> 11:44.120
How come the power is on right now?

11:44.120 --> 11:48.120
How come I can record edit upload this video and you can watch it halfway across the world

11:48.280 --> 11:51.080
How come you can go to the grocery store and get food?

11:51.320 --> 11:55.800
How does the food get from farm to warehouse to store to your kitchen?

11:56.200 --> 12:01.400
I'm not saying that there's no corruption and i'm not saying that psychopaths don't occasionally enter into a system

12:01.800 --> 12:05.080
And hideously corrupt and destroy it that happens a lot

12:05.400 --> 12:08.940
But if you think that our society isn't at least partially meritocratic

12:09.320 --> 12:14.920
Then you have to be living in in some kind of isolated bubble meritocracy has become a leading social ideal

12:15.460 --> 12:22.600
Politicians across the ideological spectrum continually return to the theme that the rewards of life money power jobs university admission

12:22.920 --> 12:25.960
Should be distributed according to skill and effort. Yeah

12:26.600 --> 12:28.040
Yeah, that's how it should be

12:28.040 --> 12:29.800
You shouldn't get something for nothing

12:29.800 --> 12:36.440
Although widely held the belief that merit rather than luck determines success or failure in the world is demonstratively false

12:36.920 --> 12:41.240
This is not least because merit itself is in large part the result of luck

12:41.880 --> 12:48.920
Talent and the capacity for determined effort sometimes called grit depend a great deal on one's genetic endowments and upbringing

12:49.240 --> 12:53.720
Well, here's the problem with your argument, you know, it is the result of luck definitely

12:54.200 --> 12:57.880
But do you know what luck is luck is effort over time?

12:58.840 --> 13:00.440
That's really all it is

13:00.440 --> 13:04.840
Let's say you want to you know play in sports or something. All right, and from a young age

13:05.320 --> 13:08.600
You you practice and you're terrible at the sport of your choice

13:09.160 --> 13:13.720
But you practice every day you practice every day you practice you do get better you get better you get better

13:14.040 --> 13:18.440
After years after a decade of practice, you're you're pretty good at your sport. All right

13:19.720 --> 13:23.720
And then you get lucky your one shot comes along

13:24.440 --> 13:27.400
And because you have a decade of experience under your belt

13:28.440 --> 13:33.320
You've at least accumulated enough skill to take a decent chance at that shot

13:33.800 --> 13:37.640
Now if you didn't practice for that decade and the shot came along you would instantly blow it

13:39.080 --> 13:41.080
And here's how you can conceptualize it

13:41.800 --> 13:43.800
Every single day that you practiced

13:44.200 --> 13:47.400
And you didn't get lucky and and your shot didn't come along

13:48.440 --> 13:55.400
That was a failure in a sense. It wasn't a failure because you practice you gain skills you you broaden your horizon a little bit

13:56.040 --> 13:59.880
But it was a failure and that you didn't actually accomplish your long-term goal

14:01.720 --> 14:07.560
You had to wait you had to wait a decade's worth of days where you practice with no results

14:08.600 --> 14:16.360
That's what getting lucky is because all of us every single one of us every single human being on this planet will at some point

14:16.920 --> 14:21.080
Get lucky we will have a chance to do something that we love

14:21.640 --> 14:24.840
We will have a shot if you have prepared for your shot

14:25.320 --> 14:31.720
If you do the work when nobody else is watching then when you finally do get lucky you can take advantage of it

14:31.960 --> 14:35.560
So this person is right in that it is the result of luck

14:36.120 --> 14:39.080
This person is wrong because they don't know what luck is

14:39.640 --> 14:45.560
You'll notice that people who are exceptionally unlucky are also people who are exceptionally lazy

14:45.960 --> 14:51.480
Now one of those things the laziness or the luck didn't cause the other they're they're not correlated in that way

14:51.640 --> 14:55.720
But what happened was that when those people had their chances they had their shots

14:56.200 --> 14:59.720
They couldn't rise to the challenge in addition to being false

15:00.360 --> 15:07.900
A growing body of research and psychology and neuroscience suggests believing in meritocracy makes people more selfish less self-critical

15:08.280 --> 15:11.240
And even more prone to acting in discriminatory ways

15:12.100 --> 15:14.520
Meritocracy is not only wrong. It's bad

15:15.240 --> 15:22.060
I can see more selfish because if you have earned your success rightfully, you may want to hold on to it. That's understandable

15:23.000 --> 15:29.160
I don't see self. I don't see less self-critical because the most successful people are are very self-critical

15:29.480 --> 15:36.060
They're constantly reinventing themselves. They're constantly burning away the dead wood that exists inside of themselves

15:36.840 --> 15:40.540
There's no way that they're self. There's no way that they're less self-critical

15:41.960 --> 15:44.280
As for prone to acting in discriminatory ways

15:45.400 --> 15:47.400
See this person doesn't really

15:47.400 --> 15:51.320
Expand that idea in this article. What do you mean by discriminatory ways?

15:51.480 --> 15:59.080
Do you mean that they just become racists or sexist legitimately? They just view other groups as naturally inferior. That would be a problem

15:59.240 --> 16:03.080
If by discriminatory ways do they say things like well

16:03.320 --> 16:08.040
Maybe america's black community is doing poorly not because of racism

16:08.040 --> 16:12.700
But because fathers don't stick around to raise their kids and those kids grow up with fewer opportunities

16:13.720 --> 16:14.760
because

16:14.760 --> 16:16.040
That's true

16:16.040 --> 16:19.240
It also makes you a racist to say in today's climate

16:19.880 --> 16:25.080
But it is the heart of the problem at least in in terms of black america what this sounds like to me

16:25.400 --> 16:32.060
Is that meritocracy is not only wrong it's bad to this person because the lines of thinking that lead you to meritocracy

16:32.600 --> 16:40.600
Also lead you to realize that there are causes for the world's problems other than racism and sexism. Here's something really dumb

16:41.300 --> 16:44.520
Hawaii considers raising legal smoking age to a hundred years

16:45.720 --> 16:49.400
So you just want to just want to ban smoking in hawaii then basically

16:49.800 --> 16:52.200
You can have hundred year olds show up and smoke and that's about it

16:52.440 --> 16:55.160
Hawaii already has some of the toughest laws in cigarette sales

16:55.160 --> 17:01.720
But democrat politician richard kiegan who is a doctor believes more needs to be done to ban the deadliest artifact in human history

17:02.440 --> 17:04.440
to be fair, you know, um

17:05.080 --> 17:07.080
Like I wouldn't want smoking to be banned

17:07.560 --> 17:11.960
But I wouldn't necessarily fight for it too hard if it was like it was just out of my hands

17:12.040 --> 17:14.760
I wouldn't be like this is a travesty like smoking's pretty fucking bad

17:15.000 --> 17:20.520
It really is the the drug argument. I can see both sides right like should poison be legal

17:21.320 --> 17:29.320
Probably not you would not knowingly ingest radioactive isotopes or some bullshit right at the same time should people be allowed to

17:29.880 --> 17:32.200
Get high at the expense of their own health

17:32.840 --> 17:34.680
Yeah, probably

17:34.680 --> 17:41.160
and you know cigarettes and alcohol provide a very a very tame sort of high in comparison to marijuana and in comparison to

17:41.640 --> 17:43.000
harder drugs

17:43.000 --> 17:44.280
but

17:44.280 --> 17:46.520
It is ultimately a victimless crime, isn't it?

17:47.160 --> 17:50.760
The person's choosing to do it to themselves so I can see both arguments

17:51.400 --> 17:52.840
and because

17:52.840 --> 17:54.840
I don't smoke. I don't drink

17:55.000 --> 17:59.400
I don't use drugs and i've never felt any serious push to do any of those things

17:59.880 --> 18:02.280
I personally do not care about this conversation

18:02.440 --> 18:07.880
But this is one of the but this is one of the times where the arguments are very evenly balanced because on the one hand

18:08.360 --> 18:08.680
You know

18:08.680 --> 18:10.680
There's the arguments against the nanny state

18:10.920 --> 18:14.520
The state of hawaii has no place telling their citizens whether they can smoke or not

18:14.600 --> 18:21.800
A legal age of 100 is ridiculous because people past 21 are adults in the states on the other hand cigarettes

18:22.280 --> 18:27.900
Are and they produce toxic substances and we often regulate toxic substances

18:28.600 --> 18:31.560
While I can understand both arguments if I really had to choose one

18:31.640 --> 18:37.820
I would I would ultimately fall on the side of letting people do what they like even if that's completely self-destructive

18:38.460 --> 18:44.540
You know as long as they're not destroying somebody else on their downward spiral, you know, I I don't really care

18:44.940 --> 18:46.940
Let's end off with something stupid

18:46.940 --> 18:52.700
Cher calls for laws to control men's bodies. They must be circumcised and show papers or penis

18:54.380 --> 18:56.140
Cher

18:56.140 --> 18:57.660
Cher

18:57.660 --> 19:02.140
I'm reasonably sure that over 50 percent of your body is artificial

19:02.380 --> 19:07.180
You have no place to be talking about whether or not men's bodies are natural here

19:07.180 --> 19:09.180
Let's read her ridiculous tweets

19:09.420 --> 19:13.500
Republicans believe they've got god-given right to dictate what we do with our bodies

19:13.980 --> 19:20.460
Women must make laws to control men's bodies. No viagra rogane or testosterone how transphobic of you

19:21.100 --> 19:24.940
All men must be circumcised and show papers or penis to prove it

19:25.500 --> 19:29.900
Massage parlors punishable by death men must take the pill

19:31.820 --> 19:32.700
What

19:32.700 --> 19:34.700
You mean like estrogen?

19:35.500 --> 19:38.060
Do you I don't know exactly what you mean by the pill

19:38.540 --> 19:44.540
Cher I think you might have gone off the fucking deep end here lady. Why is trump always pr man for villains?

19:45.100 --> 19:49.740
Why does he kowtow kiss ass of dictators child molesters murderers wife beaters?

19:50.360 --> 19:54.060
anti-semites white supremacists hater of any skin not lily white

19:54.780 --> 20:01.180
Why he's sick with envy he wants to be a king, but how can he care nothing for auto warm be?

20:02.620 --> 20:04.220
What?

20:04.220 --> 20:06.220
Cher

20:07.100 --> 20:09.100
I think it's time for you to retire

20:09.340 --> 20:12.060
You're like you're going off the deep end in your old age

20:12.780 --> 20:20.060
Anyway, I am out of here. Thank you very much guys. Thank you very much for watching this video. Thank you very much before

20:20.620 --> 20:27.020
Watching yesterday's premiere. I am for the most part back on track again and doing regular videos

20:27.660 --> 20:32.860
I appreciate your support on subscribe star because ever since I did the patreon is dying

20:33.180 --> 20:38.860
You know sargon's last laugh video my subscribe star support has has rapidly bumped up

20:39.340 --> 20:45.660
We are about one third of the way on subscribe star to me being able to comfortably live on this channel and continue to upgrade

20:45.660 --> 20:49.580
My equipment so thank you very much for all of your support. It's quite incredible

20:50.060 --> 20:56.000
If you're interested in this sort of thing, I will be streaming mass effect 2 tonight with my girlfriend

20:56.460 --> 21:00.460
We're continuing our playthrough through the entire series. She's never played it before

21:00.940 --> 21:02.940
Doing that on twitch.tv

21:03.500 --> 21:08.540

21:15.340 --> 21:20.940
I don't know if dnd is on this week. Sargon's really really dragging his butt about it

21:21.740 --> 21:23.980

21:24.220 --> 21:28.700
