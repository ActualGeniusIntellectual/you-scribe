0	5520	Good morning everyone welcome to this week's the weekly sip and in fact
6000	12640	During the the premiere yesterday. There's a whole bunch of people saying where's the sip? Where's the sip? Well here it is
17600	19600	Mmm
19600	25440	Even got a bonus gulp in there. How'd you like that and it is a very good morning indeed
25440	30000	how many of you guys are on the sfo discord because if you were
30720	33920	I did a uh a morning wake-up call 5 a.m
34240	37460	Everyone and hopefully your phone did not wake you with notifications
38160	39920	Time to get up guys
39920	43680	It uh, it seems that not too many people uh appreciated it
44560	51280	Speaking of premieres. I'm only really using them for long-form videos like uh, like yesterday's don't have kids video
52160	55360	All my short videos and the weekly sips and dumping with scrump
55920	61520	And anything else that I decide to do will probably not see a premiere only the big ones will see one
61920	65380	And I gotta say yesterday's video was uh quite divisive
66240	71200	As it's still playing out in the comment section all the uh, all the arguments. That's good though. That's good
71440	76320	There's a bunch of people who agree with my analysis. There's a bunch of people who think that I am just a fucking cuck
76880	78880	And you know, that's fine
78960	81920	But the best part about it is that we're talking about the subject
82880	88980	We're talking about whether or not to have kids. We're actually talking about the contents of the christ church shooters manifesto
89200	94080	We're not simply shutting off our brains and taking in the media narrative wholesale
94320	96900	It's more important that we discuss and disagree
97200	102720	Because the radical lefties in the media simply want us to shut off our brains and assume that it's all racist
103040	104320	So keep talking guys
104320	110560	Here's an article that I meant to actually put in yesterday's video, but I just couldn't find a way to uh to worm it in
111680	117200	Thousands of dads are left in shock as do-it-yourself paternity tests soar. Oh
118080	121760	Maybe there is something to the fact that everyone's fucking cheating nowadays
123280	128640	Up to 30 000 tests are being performed every year the dna tests can be carried out with a simple cheek swab
129360	134720	20 of men will learn they are not the father of the child. They're testing one in five
135520	140560	Sales of secret paternity tests are surging according to suppliers of do-it-yourself home kits
141440	146640	The dna tests which can be carried out with simple cheek swabs are leading to growing numbers of men discovering
146640	150400	They are not the biological father of children. They have been led to believe were theirs
151120	153840	So guys how long until this is made illegal?
154400	158800	Think about it for a minute on the argument that it's causing more and more men to
159580	166480	Disassociate from their families drop their responsibilities to these kids and their mothers break up marriages
166720	169600	Rather than actually blame the woman who cheated on the man
170080	175860	How long until the people in power make some sort of a claim that children have the exclusive right to their genetic material?
176080	181760	And that you can't steal it from them to do a test like this 20 of men will learn they're not the father
182560	185920	In some regions the figure is higher including the northeast where it's 30
186640	190000	Holy fuck. Can you imagine that's almost one in three. Holy shit
190400	196880	The explosion and demand for the test have been fueled by the ease with which definitive dna paternity results can now be obtained
197440	203360	For about 99 pounds testing kits which promise 100 accurate next day results can be bought online
203840	209520	Yeah, I think the era of mom's baby dad's maybe is is rapidly coming to an end to be honest
209520	213840	I think that a paternity test should probably be mandatory at birth
214320	220080	It's a trust but verify situation. I know the arguments against against not having the government involved
220240	225600	But if it is say a legal statute that all kids have to be paternity tested at birth
226080	232260	It removes the the awkwardness of it, you know, because let's say you're in a relationship and you have a suspicion
233200	237360	That your girl might have been having kids with somebody else and you're the sucker
238000	240000	But you have no proof you just have like a feeling
240880	243040	And then you ask oh, hey, can we get this kid?
243500	247600	Paternity tested they're going to instantly take that as an affront and you know if they're innocent
247600	250400	Why wouldn't they from the point of view of the girl if you're innocent?
250480	255440	If you have been faithful and your guy comes to you and asks for a paternity test that is a slap in the face
256720	258720	There's no easy way to do this
258960	260960	So if it becomes mandated
261360	263360	Then it becomes a lot easier to do
263520	268640	Of course, I don't think the government will ever actually mandate something like that because it goes against their interests
269040	273120	Their interests are to keep family units complete are to keep men working
274080	279760	And if necessary to keep child support payments flowing and if mandatory paternity testing disrupts that
280240	286180	A government is not going to implement it as long as the man is named on the child's birth certificate or has parental responsibility
286800	292820	No permission is required from either the mother or child meaning the test can be carried out in total secrecy
293220	296740	That's going to change too. There's going to be a legal statute for that. They're going to be like no
296820	300500	It's it's the mother's child. So the mother has the say in some u.s
300580	305620	States concern over this has led to a recent ban on do-it-yourself home dna testing
305940	311240	With all tests now having to be ordered by a doctor or court official and conducted under their supervision
312100	315060	In britain, there is no such legislation currently be considered
315940	318580	Yeah, see I didn't even read ahead in the article
318580	323620	I already knew where they were going with it and that's where they went and of course whenever this topic comes up
323780	327560	I am always reminded of this old article from 2010
328020	334500	Who's the daddy paternity can now be verified by a simple test, but it doesn't mean it should be it's a wise child
334500	338500	They say that knows its own father nowadays wisdom is hardly required
338900	343860	Dna tests can do the job with scientific certainty for the entire course of human history
344180	350020	Men have nursed profound troubling doubts about the fundamental question of whether or not they were fathers to their own children
350660	352260	women by contrast
352260	355460	Usually enjoyed a reasonable level of certainty about the matter
355780	359780	Now a cotton wool swab with a bit of saliva plus a small fee can settle the matter
360340	363940	At a stroke the one thing that women had going with them has been taken away
364340	368420	The one respect in which they had the last laugh over their husbands and lovers
369220	372820	You can see how this person's a sociopath their husbands and lovers
373700	379960	Last laugh does that really sound like the basis to have a long lasting functional stable relationship?
380420	384180	Dna tests are an anti-feminist appliance of science
385780	387300	Yeah
387300	390500	Because they take away a woman's ability to cuck a man
391060	395300	The subject has resurfaced lately because a married television presenter for who?
395540	402100	Years had been paying for the support of a child conceived as he thought as a result of his relationship with a writer
402900	406420	It seems that after meeting the child for the first time he asked for a dna test
407060	411060	It duly turned out that he was not after all the father poor child
411620	419460	Poor child. Yeah, you know what it is that that's true poor child, but also poor father or rather poor fooled father
420180	425300	The children are the victim here, but they're not the victim of society. They're not the victim of the dna test
425620	432180	They're the victim of their shitty mothers the next bridget jones movie may turn this under discussed issue into a talking point
432820	434260	Bj becomes pregnant
434260	437700	But she is not entirely sure by whom having been seeing the nice
437860	443560	Colin firth boyfriend and the bad hugh grant one in pretty short order the matter could have been fruitfully ambiguous
443860	447060	With bridget having a choice of fathers. No, no, no
447780	451860	Are you actually saying that it's better if women can just choose the father of their baby?
453220	454900	This is ridiculous
454900	456900	This is insanity
457140	462340	And apparently it's a sordid contemporary fashion for for them to get a dna test
463140	468820	And so she found out the paternity of the baby in the most ancient game of humankind. Guess the daddy wasn't played anymore
469300	471300	Yeah, and that is to our benefit
471940	473940	You fucking sociopath
473940	481220	The actor jude law recently found himself in just this position and unhesitatingly and ungallantly demanded a dna test
481700	484180	It's it's ungallant to demand a dna test
484660	487380	It's it's gallant to raise a child that's not yours
488180	495400	I mean, I guess on some level it is like if you if you decide to take on that responsibility willingly that is a supreme sacrifice
496260	499700	But nobody should be shamed for not wanting to fucking do it
500400	504580	Uncertainty allows mothers to select for their children the father who would be best for them
505780	511780	Because apparently the father's rights the father's life the father's feelings the father's finances just don't matter
512580	515880	What matters is that as a male you were selected
516500	521060	By the female and that is now what your life is about being selected by your betters
521700	528740	In making paternity conditional on a test rather than the say-so of the mother it has removed from women a powerful instrument of choice
529700	534580	That's because it should have never been your choice to begin with. Anyway, yeah this this melanie mcdonough
534980	539220	She seems like a complete fucking piece of work. Let's stay in the uk for a little bit longer
540020	541280	Nhs
541280	547860	Transgender clinic accused of covering up negative impacts of puberty blockers on children by oxford professor
548260	550020	I've always maintained that
550020	555220	If you want to transition if you want to become a trans person or you want to you know, do whatever that's your right
555300	557300	Obviously, obviously it's your right
557700	563140	But you should also be properly informed about the medical risks and to say that oh, it's no big deal
563380	567620	Snap your fingers become a woman snap your fingers become a man again. Don't worry about it
568340	575560	But that's not how it works there are risks and costs involved and talking about them frankly is not gatekeeping
576180	579460	At some point i'm going to have to do a video on on the transit situation
579540	581300	And I think lillith is going to help me out with it
581300	587940	We've been talking about it an oxford university professor has accused the nhs's only specialized clinic for transgender children
588260	592120	Of suppressing negative results while undertaking experimental treatment on adolescents
593140	595640	This is hideously unethical
596520	601720	Suppress negative results as you test on children because you have an ideology you want to push
601960	607400	They've been giving puberty blocking hormones to children without robust evidence as to the long-term effects
607560	613000	They declared the trial a success and the clinic has continued to treat over a thousand children with hormones
613320	613880	But dr
613880	620680	Biggs's research suggests that after a year of treatment a significant increase was found in patients who have been born female
621080	627740	Self-reporting to staff that they deliberately try to hurt or kill themselves and this is when you realize that the radical trans activists
628520	636520	Don't actually care about trans people. They are actually quite anti-trans because they will push the trans acceptance agenda
637320	642780	To the point that they have no problem with actual real trans people killing themselves
643160	649480	The normalization of trans status in society is more important than keeping actual trans people alive
650120	654540	According to these idiots puberty blockers exacerbated gender dysphoria
655000	660920	Yet the study has been used to justify rolling out this drug regime to several hundred children aged under 16
661320	663320	Yeah, maybe you should be waiting till they hit 18
664040	669000	Maybe you should you should be waiting till they're fucking adults before you do anything this goddamn serious
669320	674760	Let's shift gears a little bit a belief in meritocracy is not only false. It's bad for you
676440	679160	Said by somebody who probably can't fucking compete
679640	684620	Most people don't just think the world should be read meritocratically. They think it is meritocratic
685480	686520	well
686520	688440	On some level it is
688440	690440	Think about it
690600	695800	If everything was corrupt if all of our institutions were purely 100 corrupted
696200	700280	Everything was just an eternal power struggle between the people at the top and the people at the bottom
700920	702520	Why do things work?
702520	704120	How come the power is on right now?
704120	708120	How come I can record edit upload this video and you can watch it halfway across the world
708280	711080	How come you can go to the grocery store and get food?
711320	715800	How does the food get from farm to warehouse to store to your kitchen?
716200	721400	I'm not saying that there's no corruption and i'm not saying that psychopaths don't occasionally enter into a system
721800	725080	And hideously corrupt and destroy it that happens a lot
725400	728940	But if you think that our society isn't at least partially meritocratic
729320	734920	Then you have to be living in in some kind of isolated bubble meritocracy has become a leading social ideal
735460	742600	Politicians across the ideological spectrum continually return to the theme that the rewards of life money power jobs university admission
742920	745960	Should be distributed according to skill and effort. Yeah
746600	748040	Yeah, that's how it should be
748040	749800	You shouldn't get something for nothing
749800	756440	Although widely held the belief that merit rather than luck determines success or failure in the world is demonstratively false
756920	761240	This is not least because merit itself is in large part the result of luck
761880	768920	Talent and the capacity for determined effort sometimes called grit depend a great deal on one's genetic endowments and upbringing
769240	773720	Well, here's the problem with your argument, you know, it is the result of luck definitely
774200	777880	But do you know what luck is luck is effort over time?
778840	780440	That's really all it is
780440	784840	Let's say you want to you know play in sports or something. All right, and from a young age
785320	788600	You you practice and you're terrible at the sport of your choice
789160	793720	But you practice every day you practice every day you practice you do get better you get better you get better
794040	798440	After years after a decade of practice, you're you're pretty good at your sport. All right
799720	803720	And then you get lucky your one shot comes along
804440	807400	And because you have a decade of experience under your belt
808440	813320	You've at least accumulated enough skill to take a decent chance at that shot
813800	817640	Now if you didn't practice for that decade and the shot came along you would instantly blow it
819080	821080	And here's how you can conceptualize it
821800	823800	Every single day that you practiced
824200	827400	And you didn't get lucky and and your shot didn't come along
828440	835400	That was a failure in a sense. It wasn't a failure because you practice you gain skills you you broaden your horizon a little bit
836040	839880	But it was a failure and that you didn't actually accomplish your long-term goal
841720	847560	You had to wait you had to wait a decade's worth of days where you practice with no results
848600	856360	That's what getting lucky is because all of us every single one of us every single human being on this planet will at some point
856920	861080	Get lucky we will have a chance to do something that we love
861640	864840	We will have a shot if you have prepared for your shot
865320	871720	If you do the work when nobody else is watching then when you finally do get lucky you can take advantage of it
871960	875560	So this person is right in that it is the result of luck
876120	879080	This person is wrong because they don't know what luck is
879640	885560	You'll notice that people who are exceptionally unlucky are also people who are exceptionally lazy
885960	891480	Now one of those things the laziness or the luck didn't cause the other they're they're not correlated in that way
891640	895720	But what happened was that when those people had their chances they had their shots
896200	899720	They couldn't rise to the challenge in addition to being false
900360	907900	A growing body of research and psychology and neuroscience suggests believing in meritocracy makes people more selfish less self-critical
908280	911240	And even more prone to acting in discriminatory ways
912100	914520	Meritocracy is not only wrong. It's bad
915240	922060	I can see more selfish because if you have earned your success rightfully, you may want to hold on to it. That's understandable
923000	929160	I don't see self. I don't see less self-critical because the most successful people are are very self-critical
929480	936060	They're constantly reinventing themselves. They're constantly burning away the dead wood that exists inside of themselves
936840	940540	There's no way that they're self. There's no way that they're less self-critical
941960	944280	As for prone to acting in discriminatory ways
945400	947400	See this person doesn't really
947400	951320	Expand that idea in this article. What do you mean by discriminatory ways?
951480	959080	Do you mean that they just become racists or sexist legitimately? They just view other groups as naturally inferior. That would be a problem
959240	963080	If by discriminatory ways do they say things like well
963320	968040	Maybe america's black community is doing poorly not because of racism
968040	972700	But because fathers don't stick around to raise their kids and those kids grow up with fewer opportunities
973720	974760	because
974760	976040	That's true
976040	979240	It also makes you a racist to say in today's climate
979880	985080	But it is the heart of the problem at least in in terms of black america what this sounds like to me
985400	992060	Is that meritocracy is not only wrong it's bad to this person because the lines of thinking that lead you to meritocracy
992600	1000600	Also lead you to realize that there are causes for the world's problems other than racism and sexism. Here's something really dumb
1001300	1004520	Hawaii considers raising legal smoking age to a hundred years
1005720	1009400	So you just want to just want to ban smoking in hawaii then basically
1009800	1012200	You can have hundred year olds show up and smoke and that's about it
1012440	1015160	Hawaii already has some of the toughest laws in cigarette sales
1015160	1021720	But democrat politician richard kiegan who is a doctor believes more needs to be done to ban the deadliest artifact in human history
1022440	1024440	to be fair, you know, um
1025080	1027080	Like I wouldn't want smoking to be banned
1027560	1031960	But I wouldn't necessarily fight for it too hard if it was like it was just out of my hands
1032040	1034760	I wouldn't be like this is a travesty like smoking's pretty fucking bad
1035000	1040520	It really is the the drug argument. I can see both sides right like should poison be legal
1041320	1049320	Probably not you would not knowingly ingest radioactive isotopes or some bullshit right at the same time should people be allowed to
1049880	1052200	Get high at the expense of their own health
1052840	1054680	Yeah, probably
1054680	1061160	and you know cigarettes and alcohol provide a very a very tame sort of high in comparison to marijuana and in comparison to
1061640	1063000	harder drugs
1063000	1064280	but
1064280	1066520	It is ultimately a victimless crime, isn't it?
1067160	1070760	The person's choosing to do it to themselves so I can see both arguments
1071400	1072840	and because
1072840	1074840	I don't smoke. I don't drink
1075000	1079400	I don't use drugs and i've never felt any serious push to do any of those things
1079880	1082280	I personally do not care about this conversation
1082440	1087880	But this is one of the but this is one of the times where the arguments are very evenly balanced because on the one hand
1088360	1088680	You know
1088680	1090680	There's the arguments against the nanny state
1090920	1094520	The state of hawaii has no place telling their citizens whether they can smoke or not
1094600	1101800	A legal age of 100 is ridiculous because people past 21 are adults in the states on the other hand cigarettes
1102280	1107900	Are and they produce toxic substances and we often regulate toxic substances
1108600	1111560	While I can understand both arguments if I really had to choose one
1111640	1117820	I would I would ultimately fall on the side of letting people do what they like even if that's completely self-destructive
1118460	1124540	You know as long as they're not destroying somebody else on their downward spiral, you know, I I don't really care
1124940	1126940	Let's end off with something stupid
1126940	1132700	Cher calls for laws to control men's bodies. They must be circumcised and show papers or penis
1134380	1136140	Cher
1136140	1137660	Cher
