00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
Oh my god, you guys gotta see this. Bone smashing trend takes over TikTok. What is it?

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:14,720
According to Forbes, videos with the phrase bone smashing tutorial have already garnered over 267.7

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:21,920
million views on TikTok. However, there is no evidence that hitting your face with blunt objects

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,760
will do any good. What the, what the fuck am I looking at here? Are these people actually hitting

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,240
themselves in the head with hammers to get like Gigachad jaw lines? The strange trend that started

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,600
on TikTok has people hitting their faces with blunt objects like hammers, bottles, or massagers.

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh my god, I feel like hitting my face right fucking now after reading that.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,360
They're justifying this baffling practice by citing Wolff's law. Formulated by German

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,160
anatomist and surgeon Julius Wolff, it is based on the observation that you and your bones are

10
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,080
constantly undergoing remodeling with old or damaged bones continuously being resorbed and

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,640
replaced by new ones. According to the law, applying mechanical force or physical stress

12
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,160
to your bones can actually increase the rate that such remodeling occurs and in the process

13
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,200
results in stronger and thicker bones. There's no fucking way this is real, guys.

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,680
Okay, we're on TikTok. If you choose center first and-

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,720
Wait, shut up! Why is Taftage on my front page on TikTok? Bone smashing tutorial, let's go.

16
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,720
Glow up tips. No way people are doing this. Oh god, there's some music.

17
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,200
Okay, but it does seem like- I can't read this, but are people doing this? Someone in the comments

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,640
says these people are being genuine. I still don't know. I can't believe this, guys. I can't

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,480
fucking believe this. Nope, I'm doing it. I hate TikTok music, guys. Jesus. Okay, what are you

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,840
doing? Are you just punching your- Okay, these people have to be memeing. There's no way. How

21
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,080
about you, dude? How about you? Bone smashing tutorial, what are you doing? What are you doing?

22
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,080
I mean, he's lightly tapping himself with- was like a rock or something or some kind of brush?

23
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:13,120
I don't know. Okay, this is from an incel form from 2018. Serious. The serious tag is here,

24
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:21,120
guys. Bone smashing general. This dude right here got kicked max by a horse and he lived 20 more

25
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,280
years. Look at his growth. I'm not saying we should all horse kick max, but this level of

26
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,200
power can cause such swelling. Why not less power and more reasonable and controlled increments?

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,800
You know, more than anything else I've looked at on this channel, I think this might be the thing

28
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,080
that finally black pills me. Okay, according to Know Your Meme, this is the TikTok that kicked

29
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,800
it all off. Oh, they took it down. TikTok's already jumped on this trend. RIP. Yep, they've

30
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,400
all been taken down. They've all been taken down. Let's move on to something else, I guess. Welcome

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,320
to TikTok Tuesday, by the way. I hit the record button. I was getting everything together real

32
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,880
quick and then someone immediately DM'd me and I was like, Dev, you got to see this. I was like,

33
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,320
oh my God, I completely lost like all sense of what I was doing. Welcome to TikTok Tuesday.

34
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,720
The old man infiltrated the criminal syndicate and whipped its kingpin 5,000 times. Is he talking

35
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,120
in the actual elevator? He took control of the organization and launched an oppressive regime.

36
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,160
Dude, what are you doing? He had impermeable power that would only get stronger by the hour.

37
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:50,080
They were just like, what the fuck? All right, dude, if this is how you want to go viral,

38
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:58,560
I guess, I guess that's your way. Oh my God. Happy national plus size day, everyone. Finally a day

39
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,880
for me. Oh God, there's music. I'm muting it. All right. Jesus. Listen, there should be no

40
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,360
happy national plus size day. All right, guys, this isn't something to be proud of. The fact

41
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,200
that you allowed yourself to get that bad. Like I'm not even anywhere close to that, but I know

42
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,840
I'm fat guy, but like, no, like she weighs, I think like triple that I do. If you let anyone

43
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,160
get, like if you let yourself get that fucking bad, like no, there's no, there's no celebration

44
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,240
here. It should not be a national fucking holiday that your body looks like a stack of pancakes.

45
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,600
Oh my God. Stop with the music in your TikToks guys. Okay. The simplest way to remove excess

46
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:41,200
fat when cooking ground meat is, oh, you put tampons? Use two tampons in the ground meat.

47
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,320
They will absorb all the fat. I don't know how I feel about this. And I guess it works. They're

48
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,800
not used tampons, right? It's kind of weird though, isn't it? I mean, generally what I do,

49
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,840
like I know there are some assholes who just like pour the fat down the drain, which is like

50
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,480
terrible. I get like a, like a tin, like an old tin can or something that I've already used.

51
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,120
I'll just pour excess fat into that. And I'll just like build that up. And then when it gets

52
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,880
time to throw it out, I'll just freeze it. I'll freeze it in the, in the freezer and I'll throw

53
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,160
it out for garbage day. But tampons, huh? It seems like they get expensive. The tampons are kind of

54
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,840
pricey. As much as I hate this comment, I also love this comment because it offers a great...

55
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,160
Let's see the comment. I wonder how gay leftists will feel when they go to Palestine and get

56
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,440
thrown off roofs. Okay. Okay. Let's see, dude. As much as I hate this comment, I also love this

57
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,040
comment because it offers a great opportunity for learning for people who are watching this video on

58
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:35,280
TikTok. Okay. One of the most insidious tactics that Israel uses to gain legitimacy is pink

59
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,760
washing. Israel employs pink washing by portraying itself as the beacon of queer hope and liberation

60
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,880
in the Middle East in an area that is often known for violence perpetuated against queer people.

61
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,480
Listen, listen. I know like gay people. I know trannies who live in Israel. Okay. I don't know

62
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,800
any of those people who live in the Middle East. All right. Why? Because they are actually getting

63
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,800
thrown off rooftops. This is some bullshit. Including people like myself. This rhetoric

64
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,040
is insidious for several reasons. One, by emphasizing homophobia and transphobia in

65
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,960
the Palestinian community, it becomes easier to paint them as barbaric savages that do not deserve

66
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,920
freedom and a life free of apartheid. They are barbaric savages. I'm not going to sit here and

67
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,080
justify the apartheid, if that's the word that you want to use to describe what's going on.

68
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:29,200
But if the Palestinians had control over Israel, it would be another Islamic shithole, just like

69
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,400
every other Middle Eastern nation and people like you would be killed. So yes, this is fucking

70
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,400
retarded. Two, pink washing distracts people from the fact that Israel blackmails queer Palestinian

71
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,400
people to work as informants against their own communities. Is that true? I haven't heard that

72
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,440
before. I mean, it's not exactly outside of their own possibility. It's pretty bad if it happens,

73
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,880
but this is news to me. Hmm. I don't know. I got to think about that one. Finally, queerphobia,

74
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,760
homophobia, transphobia is a universal construct that every country in the world participates in.

75
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,040
Just because people aren't being thrown off of roofs in the West does not mean they are

76
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,440
not struggling as queer and trans people. What's your struggle? You're obviously not

77
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,160
being thrown off a rooftop. You seem to live in like a Western liberal capitalist democratic

78
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,560
country. You have all the freedoms that you need. Like where's the struggle? Moreover,

79
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,120
none of that was even an argument against Palestinian homophobia and transphobia.

80
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,160
It is the case that Westernized countries are better when it comes to gay and trans people

81
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,040
than Islamic shitholes. And I'm very proud of that. There was an old comic, was it Penny Arcade

82
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,800
or something? And it was like a human holding up a sign saying orc rights while it was actually

83
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,400
like a human's corpse and an orc was in the middle of eating him. Like that's basically

84
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,880
what's going on here when it comes to gay people in Palestine. These retards are cheering for their

85
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:51,440
own oppressors. Let me just get the door for you. First date. She refused to get out the car

86
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,560
because she took her to the Cheesecake Factory. Try the Cheesecake Factory. You got me at the

87
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:11,680
Cheesecake Factory. You don't like cheesecake? Yes. What's going on? Open the door for you.

88
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:25,840
You're recording me? Yeah. This is the Cheesecake Factory. Yeah. This is the Cheesecake Factory.

89
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,160
What's the problem with that? This is a chain restaurant. So? Who takes someone that looks

90
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:38,880
like this to a chain restaurant? You want to talk about it? I'm fine with talking about it.

91
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,000
Even in front of them? Oh yeah. I want to talk about it. Yeah. Come on, get on in the car.

92
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,560
You know, we're going to talk about it. What the f- the fucking entitlement! Oh my god, I wish I

93
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,240
could see that conversation. I don't have any more videos from this person so I guess this is the

94
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,640
only one they sent. Who takes a person looking like this to a chain restaurant? Bitch, you're

95
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,480
going straight to Applebee's! Sargon's gonna be our fucking server! Fuck you! Oh! Oh, I'm not-

96
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,880
I'm pissed now. What an entitled fucking asshole, dude. Alright, let's see this here. Drag queen

97
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:18,880
dressed in blood throws tampons at children at a family-friendly pride festival in- no fucking way.

98
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,600
No fucking way.

99
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,320
Yeah, those are blood stains. And she's throwing tampons at kids.

100
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,520
Well, at least some of the kids know to leave. But like- what do you do- what the fuck? I like

101
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,280
how a few years ago it was like drag queen story hour, right? And everyone was like-

102
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,920
to be honest, there were definitely some rightoids who were overreacting to the drag queen story hour

103
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,920
thing. But then, after the rightoids overreacted, they're like- soon they're gonna be- oh my god,

104
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,400
they're gonna be like naked in front of children and twerking, or they're gonna be like bringing-

105
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,440
they're gonna be making kids like put- put money in the thongs of strippers, or they're gonna be

106
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,720
doing like weird sexual shit with periods or with like dildos or whatever. It's gonna be- oh my god!

107
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,720
And then like all the leftoids are like, you guys are just losing your mind. That's never gonna

108
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,800
happen. It's happening. It's there, you know? We're- we're now at that point. We now have- we

109
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,600
now have the drag queen covered in period blood, or at least like fake period blood, throwing

110
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,040
tampons at little children. Welcome to 2023, guys. Alright, that's more than enough TikTok nonsense

111
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,760
for me today. Thanks for tuning in yet again. I appreciate it, my friends. Just like last week,

112
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,080
if you want to hear more from me, Naomi and I went to go see the movie The Creator,

113
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,920
and we did a midnight screening video of that over on the DevKit channel, so

114
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,800
click on the link on screen and check that shit out. I will see you there, guys. Have a good one.

115
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,680
I love you.
