0	7040	Oh my god, you guys gotta see this. Bone smashing trend takes over TikTok. What is it?
7040	14720	According to Forbes, videos with the phrase bone smashing tutorial have already garnered over 267.7
14720	21920	million views on TikTok. However, there is no evidence that hitting your face with blunt objects
21920	27760	will do any good. What the, what the fuck am I looking at here? Are these people actually hitting
27760	34240	themselves in the head with hammers to get like Gigachad jaw lines? The strange trend that started
34240	39600	on TikTok has people hitting their faces with blunt objects like hammers, bottles, or massagers.
39600	44000	Oh my god, I feel like hitting my face right fucking now after reading that.
44000	49360	They're justifying this baffling practice by citing Wolff's law. Formulated by German
49360	54160	anatomist and surgeon Julius Wolff, it is based on the observation that you and your bones are
54160	60080	constantly undergoing remodeling with old or damaged bones continuously being resorbed and
60080	64640	replaced by new ones. According to the law, applying mechanical force or physical stress
64640	70160	to your bones can actually increase the rate that such remodeling occurs and in the process
70160	75200	results in stronger and thicker bones. There's no fucking way this is real, guys.
75200	77680	Okay, we're on TikTok. If you choose center first and-
77680	82720	Wait, shut up! Why is Taftage on my front page on TikTok? Bone smashing tutorial, let's go.
83440	88720	Glow up tips. No way people are doing this. Oh god, there's some music.
91600	97200	Okay, but it does seem like- I can't read this, but are people doing this? Someone in the comments
97200	102640	says these people are being genuine. I still don't know. I can't believe this, guys. I can't
102640	108480	fucking believe this. Nope, I'm doing it. I hate TikTok music, guys. Jesus. Okay, what are you
108480	113840	doing? Are you just punching your- Okay, these people have to be memeing. There's no way. How
113840	118080	about you, dude? How about you? Bone smashing tutorial, what are you doing? What are you doing?
121440	126080	I mean, he's lightly tapping himself with- was like a rock or something or some kind of brush?
126080	133120	I don't know. Okay, this is from an incel form from 2018. Serious. The serious tag is here,
133120	141120	guys. Bone smashing general. This dude right here got kicked max by a horse and he lived 20 more
141120	147280	years. Look at his growth. I'm not saying we should all horse kick max, but this level of
147280	153200	power can cause such swelling. Why not less power and more reasonable and controlled increments?
153200	158800	You know, more than anything else I've looked at on this channel, I think this might be the thing
158800	164080	that finally black pills me. Okay, according to Know Your Meme, this is the TikTok that kicked
164080	170800	it all off. Oh, they took it down. TikTok's already jumped on this trend. RIP. Yep, they've
170800	176400	all been taken down. They've all been taken down. Let's move on to something else, I guess. Welcome
176400	180320	to TikTok Tuesday, by the way. I hit the record button. I was getting everything together real
180320	184880	quick and then someone immediately DM'd me and I was like, Dev, you got to see this. I was like,
184880	190320	oh my God, I completely lost like all sense of what I was doing. Welcome to TikTok Tuesday.
193760	200720	The old man infiltrated the criminal syndicate and whipped its kingpin 5,000 times. Is he talking
200720	207120	in the actual elevator? He took control of the organization and launched an oppressive regime.
207120	214160	Dude, what are you doing? He had impermeable power that would only get stronger by the hour.
214160	230080	They were just like, what the fuck? All right, dude, if this is how you want to go viral,
230080	238560	I guess, I guess that's your way. Oh my God. Happy national plus size day, everyone. Finally a day
238560	244880	for me. Oh God, there's music. I'm muting it. All right. Jesus. Listen, there should be no
244880	249360	happy national plus size day. All right, guys, this isn't something to be proud of. The fact
249360	253200	that you allowed yourself to get that bad. Like I'm not even anywhere close to that, but I know
253200	257840	I'm fat guy, but like, no, like she weighs, I think like triple that I do. If you let anyone
257840	262160	get, like if you let yourself get that fucking bad, like no, there's no, there's no celebration
262160	266240	here. It should not be a national fucking holiday that your body looks like a stack of pancakes.
267120	273600	Oh my God. Stop with the music in your TikToks guys. Okay. The simplest way to remove excess
273600	281200	fat when cooking ground meat is, oh, you put tampons? Use two tampons in the ground meat.
282240	286320	They will absorb all the fat. I don't know how I feel about this. And I guess it works. They're
286320	290800	not used tampons, right? It's kind of weird though, isn't it? I mean, generally what I do,
290800	293840	like I know there are some assholes who just like pour the fat down the drain, which is like
293840	298480	terrible. I get like a, like a tin, like an old tin can or something that I've already used.
298480	303120	I'll just pour excess fat into that. And I'll just like build that up. And then when it gets
303120	306880	time to throw it out, I'll just freeze it. I'll freeze it in the, in the freezer and I'll throw
306880	312160	it out for garbage day. But tampons, huh? It seems like they get expensive. The tampons are kind of
312160	315840	pricey. As much as I hate this comment, I also love this comment because it offers a great...
315840	320160	Let's see the comment. I wonder how gay leftists will feel when they go to Palestine and get
320160	325440	thrown off roofs. Okay. Okay. Let's see, dude. As much as I hate this comment, I also love this
325440	329040	comment because it offers a great opportunity for learning for people who are watching this video on
329040	335280	TikTok. Okay. One of the most insidious tactics that Israel uses to gain legitimacy is pink
335280	341760	washing. Israel employs pink washing by portraying itself as the beacon of queer hope and liberation
341760	346880	in the Middle East in an area that is often known for violence perpetuated against queer people.
347440	354480	Listen, listen. I know like gay people. I know trannies who live in Israel. Okay. I don't know
354480	358800	any of those people who live in the Middle East. All right. Why? Because they are actually getting
358800	364800	thrown off rooftops. This is some bullshit. Including people like myself. This rhetoric
364800	369040	is insidious for several reasons. One, by emphasizing homophobia and transphobia in
369040	372960	the Palestinian community, it becomes easier to paint them as barbaric savages that do not deserve
372960	377920	freedom and a life free of apartheid. They are barbaric savages. I'm not going to sit here and
377920	382080	justify the apartheid, if that's the word that you want to use to describe what's going on.
382080	389200	But if the Palestinians had control over Israel, it would be another Islamic shithole, just like
389200	394400	every other Middle Eastern nation and people like you would be killed. So yes, this is fucking
394400	400400	retarded. Two, pink washing distracts people from the fact that Israel blackmails queer Palestinian
400400	404400	people to work as informants against their own communities. Is that true? I haven't heard that
404400	409440	before. I mean, it's not exactly outside of their own possibility. It's pretty bad if it happens,
409440	414880	but this is news to me. Hmm. I don't know. I got to think about that one. Finally, queerphobia,
414880	419760	homophobia, transphobia is a universal construct that every country in the world participates in.
419760	423040	Just because people aren't being thrown off of roofs in the West does not mean they are
423040	427440	not struggling as queer and trans people. What's your struggle? You're obviously not
427440	432160	being thrown off a rooftop. You seem to live in like a Western liberal capitalist democratic
432160	436560	country. You have all the freedoms that you need. Like where's the struggle? Moreover,
436560	441120	none of that was even an argument against Palestinian homophobia and transphobia.
441120	446160	It is the case that Westernized countries are better when it comes to gay and trans people
446160	451040	than Islamic shitholes. And I'm very proud of that. There was an old comic, was it Penny Arcade
451040	456800	or something? And it was like a human holding up a sign saying orc rights while it was actually
456800	460400	like a human's corpse and an orc was in the middle of eating him. Like that's basically
460400	464880	what's going on here when it comes to gay people in Palestine. These retards are cheering for their
464880	471440	own oppressors. Let me just get the door for you. First date. She refused to get out the car
471440	476560	because she took her to the Cheesecake Factory. Try the Cheesecake Factory. You got me at the
476560	491680	Cheesecake Factory. You don't like cheesecake? Yes. What's going on? Open the door for you.
496400	505840	You're recording me? Yeah. This is the Cheesecake Factory. Yeah. This is the Cheesecake Factory.
506560	512160	What's the problem with that? This is a chain restaurant. So? Who takes someone that looks
512160	518880	like this to a chain restaurant? You want to talk about it? I'm fine with talking about it.
518880	524000	Even in front of them? Oh yeah. I want to talk about it. Yeah. Come on, get on in the car.
524000	530560	You know, we're going to talk about it. What the f- the fucking entitlement! Oh my god, I wish I
530560	534240	could see that conversation. I don't have any more videos from this person so I guess this is the
534240	538640	only one they sent. Who takes a person looking like this to a chain restaurant? Bitch, you're
538640	544480	going straight to Applebee's! Sargon's gonna be our fucking server! Fuck you! Oh! Oh, I'm not-
544480	550880	I'm pissed now. What an entitled fucking asshole, dude. Alright, let's see this here. Drag queen
550880	558880	dressed in blood throws tampons at children at a family-friendly pride festival in- no fucking way.
558880	559600	No fucking way.
562960	568320	Yeah, those are blood stains. And she's throwing tampons at kids.
570240	575520	Well, at least some of the kids know to leave. But like- what do you do- what the fuck? I like
575520	579280	how a few years ago it was like drag queen story hour, right? And everyone was like-
579280	583920	to be honest, there were definitely some rightoids who were overreacting to the drag queen story hour
583920	589920	thing. But then, after the rightoids overreacted, they're like- soon they're gonna be- oh my god,
589920	594400	they're gonna be like naked in front of children and twerking, or they're gonna be like bringing-
594400	599440	they're gonna be making kids like put- put money in the thongs of strippers, or they're gonna be
599440	604720	doing like weird sexual shit with periods or with like dildos or whatever. It's gonna be- oh my god!
604720	608720	And then like all the leftoids are like, you guys are just losing your mind. That's never gonna
608720	614800	happen. It's happening. It's there, you know? We're- we're now at that point. We now have- we
614800	619600	now have the drag queen covered in period blood, or at least like fake period blood, throwing
619600	625040	tampons at little children. Welcome to 2023, guys. Alright, that's more than enough TikTok nonsense
625040	629760	for me today. Thanks for tuning in yet again. I appreciate it, my friends. Just like last week,
629760	634080	if you want to hear more from me, Naomi and I went to go see the movie The Creator,
634080	637920	and we did a midnight screening video of that over on the DevKit channel, so
637920	644800	click on the link on screen and check that shit out. I will see you there, guys. Have a good one.
644800	645680	I love you.
