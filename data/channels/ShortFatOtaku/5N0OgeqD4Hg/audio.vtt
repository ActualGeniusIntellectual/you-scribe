00:00.000 --> 00:10.280
So, I missed the boat on this one a little bit, but super straight is a thing apparently.

00:10.280 --> 00:15.120
With the representation flag of black, orange, and sometimes white, super straight people

00:15.120 --> 00:19.800
are attracted to individuals of the opposite sex, excluding trans people. Of course, that

00:19.800 --> 00:24.300
whole excluding thing has people up in arms because we're on the internet, so maybe I

00:24.300 --> 00:28.980
can parse it a little bit better. If a trans woman is biologically male but adopts the

00:28.980 --> 00:33.520
gender role of a woman, and that is how I understand it to be the case, then your average

00:33.520 --> 00:37.760
straight man, by the intersectional definition, is somebody who is attracted to people who

00:37.760 --> 00:42.700
adopt the gender role of woman, meaning cis women and trans women, regardless of their

00:42.700 --> 00:47.880
biology. Okay, fair enough. If this is the case, then a super straight man is somebody

00:47.880 --> 00:53.260
who is attracted to people who adopt the gender role of woman and have the biology of a female.

00:53.260 --> 00:58.380
And I guess to simplify it, super straightness is being attracted to people whose biology

00:58.420 --> 01:03.920
and gender role match, and who are the opposite of you in both respects. There we go. No more

01:03.920 --> 01:08.920
use of the word excluding in the definition. No more exclusion. Is everybody happy now?

01:08.920 --> 01:15.440
Yeah, I figured not. This whole super straight thing was started by a viral TikTok. Damn,

01:15.440 --> 01:20.480
TikToks are still going viral. Maybe I should start one. Yo, guys, I made a new sexuality

01:20.480 --> 01:25.080
now, actually. It's called super straight, okay? Since straight people or straight men

01:25.080 --> 01:29.880
is myself, I get called transphobic because I wouldn't date a trans woman. You know, they're

01:29.880 --> 01:34.720
like, would you date a trans woman? I'm like, no. Why? That's a female. No, like that's

01:34.720 --> 01:39.160
not a real woman to me. Like I want a real woman. No, you're just transphobic. So now

01:39.160 --> 01:44.040
I'm super straight. I only date the opposite gender, women that are born women. So you

01:44.040 --> 01:49.880
can't say I'm transphobic now because that's just my sexuality, you know? And this spawned

01:49.880 --> 01:53.840
a whole bunch of other people who were doing it, presumably just to troll. I'm super straight

01:53.840 --> 01:58.880
and I'm proud. Just so you know, I support the super straights. I can't believe how heterophobic

01:58.880 --> 02:04.800
people have gone. We just want our partner to be biologically clean and natural and we

02:04.800 --> 02:09.000
still accept trans people and super phobia. Did you know that there's a lot of super people

02:09.000 --> 02:13.160
are getting harassed and getting death threats every day? Stop the super phobia. Hashtag

02:13.160 --> 02:17.880
super straight hate is real. That's what super straight means. Stop calling us homophobes.

02:17.880 --> 02:23.080
Oh, look, the super straight community even raised $6,500 to benefit the Vancouver Rape

02:23.080 --> 02:28.540
Relief Society. We care super straight. Like and retweet if you're super straight and proud.

02:28.540 --> 02:32.840
And see, this is how it works. Here's a handy dandy guide. Learn the difference and stop

02:32.840 --> 02:37.540
being a bigot. But of course, straightphobes do what all other phobes do. They rewrite

02:37.540 --> 02:43.120
history and push their own ideology. Now you're a transphobe if you only date cis people and

02:43.120 --> 02:47.160
not trans people of the opposite gender. Some of them just don't seem to understand that

02:47.160 --> 02:52.520
you can be both a super straight ally and a trans ally. Fuck transphobia. Repost if

02:52.560 --> 02:58.000
you're super phobic. Retweet if your account is not a safe space for super straight people.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.320
Stop the hate, guys. But it gets even worse. If I ever see anyone calling themselves a

03:02.320 --> 03:07.480
super straight, I won't hesitate to kill them. I'm going to attack and kill anyone identifying

03:07.480 --> 03:11.820
as super straight. I wish all super straight people an ugly evening. I'm coming for you.

03:11.820 --> 03:16.480
The amount of open death threats against the super straight community is astronomical.

03:16.480 --> 03:20.600
Of course, they outright admit that they believe super straight is transphobic because, say

03:20.600 --> 03:47.120
it with me, it excludes trans people. And that is the first argument against the idea

03:47.120 --> 03:51.480
of the super straight. It's an argument that predates super straight, in fact. It's that

03:51.480 --> 03:55.960
if trans women are women, then refusing to date trans women as a straight man or as a

03:55.960 --> 04:01.200
lesbian cis woman is transphobia. In other words, you don't see them as the gender they

04:01.200 --> 04:06.480
identify as, and therefore you are rejecting their existence as that gender, and therefore

04:06.480 --> 04:11.040
you're transphobic. Obviously, not all trans activists think this way. Certainly not all

04:11.040 --> 04:15.200
trans people are saying a suck the dick bigot. But hey, that was a joke phrase just a few

04:15.200 --> 04:20.080
years ago, and with this new reaction to super straight, as well as the corresponding super gay

04:20.080 --> 04:24.480
and super lesbian, we're actually approaching that spot now. We're obviously just having a

04:24.480 --> 04:29.320
laugh here, guys, but the underlying question beneath everything ultimately is, when do you

04:29.320 --> 04:34.600
have the right to be prejudicial? Or do you at all? There is this assumption on the broader left

04:34.600 --> 04:39.640
that prejudice is always bad, period. But we already have a good idea of what happens if you

04:39.640 --> 04:44.520
take that position to its logical conclusion. As one of many examples, in Huxley's Brave New

04:44.520 --> 04:50.000
World, the futuristic society of the world state prioritizes science, efficiency, and communal

04:50.000 --> 04:55.080
ownership, and one of its mottos is, everyone belongs to everyone else. In this world, it is

04:55.080 --> 04:59.920
illegal to reject any sexual advance from anyone else, because it's considered solipsistic,

04:59.920 --> 05:05.400
discriminatory, and prejudicial. But to a liberal, and to our liberal society, which prioritizes

05:05.400 --> 05:11.280
self-ownership, property, and speech, this idea is monstrous. We have the right to our prejudices

05:11.280 --> 05:15.520
as part of the right of association. And while it might sound a little bit silly to have to say

05:15.520 --> 05:21.000
this, if you've entered into an exclusive monogamous relationship, on some level that is the ultimate

05:21.000 --> 05:26.720
prejudice. You've publicly declared that you're limiting your sexuality for you and your partner,

05:26.720 --> 05:33.040
nobody else. In order to have that kind of relationship, you must, by necessity, discriminate

05:33.040 --> 05:37.480
against everybody you're not with, in order to privilege your partner. And clearly we consider

05:37.600 --> 05:42.320
this to be justifiable, because in order to operate in the world we have to rank order things in terms

05:42.320 --> 05:47.720
of how they are valuable to us. We've even got biological brain structure set up to do this sort

05:47.720 --> 05:52.520
of thing. Again, it feels weird that I have to say this, but everything is not the same about every

05:52.520 --> 05:57.080
other thing all the time. Once again, we're back to the conversation about hierarchy and value,

05:57.080 --> 06:01.920
because these concepts are inescapable to the human experience, and this is likely the source

06:01.920 --> 06:07.180
of the heavy crossover between trans activism and radical socialism. Their shared disdain for the

06:07.180 --> 06:12.180
concepts of value, preference, rank ordering, and hierarchy. There is a second reason that such an

06:12.180 --> 06:17.460
obvious lark as supersexual has received this kind of a pushback though, and it's that it punches a

06:17.460 --> 06:23.100
huge hole in the intersectionalist self-definition is king type of ideology. This sort of thing has

06:23.100 --> 06:27.740
been bubbling up in the lesbian community for a lot longer than anywhere else, where cis lesbians

06:27.740 --> 06:31.940
have been told they're bigoted for not being interested in trans women, where lesbian exclusive

06:31.940 --> 06:36.420
dating apps have opened the door to trans women in the name of diversity. I'm not opposed to any

06:36.460 --> 06:41.100
of these people having sex or forming relationships with whoever they want for whatever reason, but if

06:41.100 --> 06:48.180
to use the current meme terminology, a super lesbian wants to go on a dating app meant exclusively

06:48.180 --> 06:52.900
for other super lesbians, that doesn't seem too objectionable to me. Remember, it's the right of

06:52.900 --> 06:57.660
association, but not to some of these people. To them, it's instead the cotton ceiling. These

06:57.660 --> 07:03.300
preferences must not be respected, but smashed through as if they were akin to the glass ceiling.

07:03.300 --> 07:08.860
People who were radical leftist feminists a decade ago are now considered right-wing bigots due to

07:08.860 --> 07:13.500
this shift in the discourse, and I gotta say it's been a wild ride watching it all go down. But

07:13.500 --> 07:18.860
remember, identification is the name of the game. If you can pull out an entire book of newly defined

07:18.860 --> 07:24.060
different sexualities to differentiate the minute granular differences between other types of sexual

07:24.060 --> 07:28.860
preference, what is the basis for the objection to this one? I mean, in that list you'll find

07:28.860 --> 07:35.820
scoliosexual, a sexual orientation that describes those who are sexually attracted to people with

07:35.820 --> 07:41.700
non cisgender identities, such as people who are non-binary, genderqueer, or trans, otherwise known

07:41.700 --> 07:48.020
as a chaser. Alright, if this exists, why is there such an overreaction to its opposite? Is it because

07:48.020 --> 07:52.500
it's called super straight? Were the implication buried deep in there as that trans women aren't

07:52.500 --> 07:57.980
women? Okay, well why don't we just rename it? What if we called it anti-scoliosexual? Maybe we

07:58.020 --> 08:03.740
just call it femalesexual? Cissexual? If the complaint really is just the meme-like nature

08:03.740 --> 08:08.820
of the name, like say, with trap, then there shouldn't be any problem with the action of men

08:08.820 --> 08:13.180
actually excluding trans women from their pool of potential partners, however you want to call

08:13.180 --> 08:18.820
that action. If genital preferences do have a huge impact on your sexuality, maybe look into

08:18.820 --> 08:26.420
impresexual? What the? Alright. Impresexual is a term for those who have such specific sexual

08:26.420 --> 08:32.100
preferences, it may feel as though it matters more than one's orientation itself. So this is

08:32.100 --> 08:37.140
literally an LGBT friendly variant of super straight, where the sexual orientation is

08:37.140 --> 08:43.580
whatever preference you have. Alright? The funniest bit is, this page was made by a trans person as a

08:43.580 --> 08:49.020
non-transphobic alternative to super straight. It's already been rejected by feminist and lesbian

08:49.020 --> 08:55.660
blogs. And over on reddit, r slash impresexual was made by a progressive who is currently trying to

08:55.660 --> 09:00.380
popularize the term with other progressives. And other progressives are instead attacking them,

09:00.380 --> 09:05.700
thinking that the idea was made as a parody by those feminist and lesbian blogs that have

09:05.700 --> 09:10.380
rejected the idea. The amount of infighting happening over this dumb shit is amazing.

09:10.380 --> 09:16.180
However, we all know why there's so much anger directed at what is obviously a troll-op. The

09:16.180 --> 09:20.980
observed rules of intersectional theory have been that you can identify as a sexuality, slap a label

09:20.980 --> 09:27.300
on it, and it's now valid. Heckin cute and valid in fact. By those same rules, there's no reason

09:27.300 --> 09:31.900
you can't simply identify as super sexual, and claim to be oppressed whenever you receive criticism

09:31.900 --> 09:36.220
of it. You can even point to any number of institutions that are explicitly pro-trans,

09:36.220 --> 09:40.580
and announce that they systemically discriminate against you. Not because those institutions are

09:40.580 --> 09:46.100
actually super phobic, but because they normalize and clandestinely promote super phobia through

09:46.100 --> 09:50.660
their passive neutrality. There's no standing still on a moving train after all. You can even

09:50.820 --> 09:56.540
make a blatant power play, and have Donkey Kong say super straight rights. Or anybody else, really.

09:56.540 --> 10:02.780
Why not? It's the same thing as when trans activists shoehorn in their ideology in a place that is

10:02.780 --> 10:08.740
explicitly non-political, under the argument of, this isn't politics, it's our existence. Okay,

10:08.740 --> 10:14.780
it's all fair game then. And so there is no actual coherent argument when somebody comes along and

10:14.780 --> 10:19.540
says, I identify as super straight. This is why they can only reply with either death threats,

10:19.580 --> 10:24.860
or long threads that are immediately self contradictory, or end with, yeah you can do it,

10:24.860 --> 10:30.260
I just don't like how you do it. Yes, super straight is obviously a joke, but the punchline

10:30.260 --> 10:35.200
of the joke is everybody who got so mad about it, that they actually believe it was started by

10:35.200 --> 10:41.500
neo-nazis as a 4chan op, in order to literally kill trans people literally, and not just a guy

10:41.500 --> 10:45.940
making a tiktok in his car about his sexual preference. And there's been some good memes

10:45.980 --> 10:51.220
and funny burns out of it, like that girl who said super straight is a mental disorder and got owned

10:51.220 --> 10:56.740
by the dude replying with, it used to be, but we successfully harassed enough people in the American

10:56.740 --> 11:02.420
Psychological Association to have it removed from the DSM-5. Damn dude. Whenever trans activists

11:02.420 --> 11:07.500
bitch about straight men not being into them, it honestly sounds like the radical feminists,

11:07.500 --> 11:12.100
who complain that gay men are only gay because they're misogynists. At the end of the day,

11:12.100 --> 11:16.900
it's just another way to try and overwrite and invalidate somebody else's consent because you

11:16.900 --> 11:20.220
want to fuck them and they don't want to fuck you. And we've seen this sort of thing before,

11:20.220 --> 11:25.860
multiple times. Last year, it was the LGB Alliance, where some gay people wanted the

11:25.860 --> 11:31.700
T out of LGBT, because the struggles that gays, lesbians, and bisexuals face are all related to

11:31.700 --> 11:36.940
each other, and yet distinct from the struggles that trans people face. There is some intersectional

11:36.940 --> 11:41.780
and lefty logic to this. In one of my university gender studies classes, I learned that the history

11:41.780 --> 11:47.380
of the movement saw LGBT lumped in not out of a concrete shared solidarity, but because back in

11:47.380 --> 11:52.340
the 1950s, there was a predominant view among the cishet patriarchal society that we live in that

11:52.340 --> 11:58.700
gay men, pedophiles, transsexuals as they were called back then, cross dressers, and drag queens

11:58.700 --> 12:04.100
were all the same thing, or at least had a lot of heavy overlap. The dominant culture did not

12:04.100 --> 12:08.580
conceive of these things as fully separate and distinct, and so the activism surrounding them

12:08.580 --> 12:14.180
emerged reflecting that. But it's 2021, and nowadays, forcing the LGB and the T together

12:14.180 --> 12:20.020
artificially for that 1950s era reason sounds rather transphobic by our modern standards,

12:20.020 --> 12:26.340
doesn't it? And the year before that, it was LGBTS, making the LGBT movement more inclusive

12:26.340 --> 12:31.140
by adding S for straight. Because why not? It covers more people that way. And again,

12:31.140 --> 12:35.700
by the rules of intersectionality, these are all valid identities that need protection and

12:35.700 --> 12:40.340
acceptance from bigots. It even got to the point that Boston approved a straight pride

12:40.340 --> 12:45.620
permit with the event's organizer, John Hugo, saying, We don't hate anyone. We just want to

12:45.620 --> 12:50.500
have our own celebration, just like everybody else has a right to. All people from all communities

12:50.500 --> 12:55.140
are welcome as long as they show respect. Each of these events are, on their face, ridiculous

12:55.140 --> 13:00.180
and unnecessary. But every time one of them goes down, there is a contingent of always on Twitter

13:00.180 --> 13:05.780
people who publicly and spectacularly self-destruct in waves of unbridled rage over

13:05.780 --> 13:11.780
what your average disinterested, unengaged normie can clearly recognize as an obvious joke by internet

13:11.780 --> 13:16.180
trolls meant to stir the pot. Intersectional activists are their own downfall. Every time

13:16.180 --> 13:20.340
someone pokes fun at them, they publicly shit themselves. And the silent majority has been

13:20.340 --> 13:27.060
watching it happen for years. LGBT activists are the reason that LGBT acceptance is on the decline.

13:27.060 --> 13:32.420
In the end, if you actually identify as super straight, you're probably just an idiot getting

13:32.420 --> 13:37.620
a bit too sucked into what's obviously this month's flash-in-the-pan meme. On the flip side,

13:37.620 --> 13:42.420
if you're actually angry at super straight, well, you're the very reason it's going to keep happening.

13:43.140 --> 13:47.860
