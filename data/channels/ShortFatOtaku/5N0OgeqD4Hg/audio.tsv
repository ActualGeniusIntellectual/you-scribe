0	10280	So, I missed the boat on this one a little bit, but super straight is a thing apparently.
10280	15120	With the representation flag of black, orange, and sometimes white, super straight people
15120	19800	are attracted to individuals of the opposite sex, excluding trans people. Of course, that
19800	24300	whole excluding thing has people up in arms because we're on the internet, so maybe I
24300	28980	can parse it a little bit better. If a trans woman is biologically male but adopts the
28980	33520	gender role of a woman, and that is how I understand it to be the case, then your average
33520	37760	straight man, by the intersectional definition, is somebody who is attracted to people who
37760	42700	adopt the gender role of woman, meaning cis women and trans women, regardless of their
42700	47880	biology. Okay, fair enough. If this is the case, then a super straight man is somebody
47880	53260	who is attracted to people who adopt the gender role of woman and have the biology of a female.
53260	58380	And I guess to simplify it, super straightness is being attracted to people whose biology
58420	63920	and gender role match, and who are the opposite of you in both respects. There we go. No more
63920	68920	use of the word excluding in the definition. No more exclusion. Is everybody happy now?
68920	75440	Yeah, I figured not. This whole super straight thing was started by a viral TikTok. Damn,
75440	80480	TikToks are still going viral. Maybe I should start one. Yo, guys, I made a new sexuality
80480	85080	now, actually. It's called super straight, okay? Since straight people or straight men
85080	89880	is myself, I get called transphobic because I wouldn't date a trans woman. You know, they're
89880	94720	like, would you date a trans woman? I'm like, no. Why? That's a female. No, like that's
94720	99160	not a real woman to me. Like I want a real woman. No, you're just transphobic. So now
99160	104040	I'm super straight. I only date the opposite gender, women that are born women. So you
104040	109880	can't say I'm transphobic now because that's just my sexuality, you know? And this spawned
109880	113840	a whole bunch of other people who were doing it, presumably just to troll. I'm super straight
113840	118880	and I'm proud. Just so you know, I support the super straights. I can't believe how heterophobic
118880	124800	people have gone. We just want our partner to be biologically clean and natural and we
124800	129000	still accept trans people and super phobia. Did you know that there's a lot of super people
129000	133160	are getting harassed and getting death threats every day? Stop the super phobia. Hashtag
133160	137880	super straight hate is real. That's what super straight means. Stop calling us homophobes.
137880	143080	Oh, look, the super straight community even raised $6,500 to benefit the Vancouver Rape
143080	148540	Relief Society. We care super straight. Like and retweet if you're super straight and proud.
148540	152840	And see, this is how it works. Here's a handy dandy guide. Learn the difference and stop
152840	157540	being a bigot. But of course, straightphobes do what all other phobes do. They rewrite
157540	163120	history and push their own ideology. Now you're a transphobe if you only date cis people and
163120	167160	not trans people of the opposite gender. Some of them just don't seem to understand that
167160	172520	you can be both a super straight ally and a trans ally. Fuck transphobia. Repost if
172560	178000	you're super phobic. Retweet if your account is not a safe space for super straight people.
178000	182320	Stop the hate, guys. But it gets even worse. If I ever see anyone calling themselves a
182320	187480	super straight, I won't hesitate to kill them. I'm going to attack and kill anyone identifying
187480	191820	as super straight. I wish all super straight people an ugly evening. I'm coming for you.
191820	196480	The amount of open death threats against the super straight community is astronomical.
196480	200600	Of course, they outright admit that they believe super straight is transphobic because, say
200600	227120	it with me, it excludes trans people. And that is the first argument against the idea
227120	231480	of the super straight. It's an argument that predates super straight, in fact. It's that
231480	235960	if trans women are women, then refusing to date trans women as a straight man or as a
235960	241200	lesbian cis woman is transphobia. In other words, you don't see them as the gender they
241200	246480	identify as, and therefore you are rejecting their existence as that gender, and therefore
246480	251040	you're transphobic. Obviously, not all trans activists think this way. Certainly not all
251040	255200	trans people are saying a suck the dick bigot. But hey, that was a joke phrase just a few
255200	260080	years ago, and with this new reaction to super straight, as well as the corresponding super gay
260080	264480	and super lesbian, we're actually approaching that spot now. We're obviously just having a
264480	269320	laugh here, guys, but the underlying question beneath everything ultimately is, when do you
269320	274600	have the right to be prejudicial? Or do you at all? There is this assumption on the broader left
274600	279640	that prejudice is always bad, period. But we already have a good idea of what happens if you
279640	284520	take that position to its logical conclusion. As one of many examples, in Huxley's Brave New
284520	290000	World, the futuristic society of the world state prioritizes science, efficiency, and communal
290000	295080	ownership, and one of its mottos is, everyone belongs to everyone else. In this world, it is
295080	299920	illegal to reject any sexual advance from anyone else, because it's considered solipsistic,
299920	305400	discriminatory, and prejudicial. But to a liberal, and to our liberal society, which prioritizes
305400	311280	self-ownership, property, and speech, this idea is monstrous. We have the right to our prejudices
311280	315520	as part of the right of association. And while it might sound a little bit silly to have to say
315520	321000	this, if you've entered into an exclusive monogamous relationship, on some level that is the ultimate
321000	326720	prejudice. You've publicly declared that you're limiting your sexuality for you and your partner,
326720	333040	nobody else. In order to have that kind of relationship, you must, by necessity, discriminate
333040	337480	against everybody you're not with, in order to privilege your partner. And clearly we consider
337600	342320	this to be justifiable, because in order to operate in the world we have to rank order things in terms
342320	347720	of how they are valuable to us. We've even got biological brain structure set up to do this sort
347720	352520	of thing. Again, it feels weird that I have to say this, but everything is not the same about every
352520	357080	other thing all the time. Once again, we're back to the conversation about hierarchy and value,
357080	361920	because these concepts are inescapable to the human experience, and this is likely the source
361920	367180	of the heavy crossover between trans activism and radical socialism. Their shared disdain for the
367180	372180	concepts of value, preference, rank ordering, and hierarchy. There is a second reason that such an
372180	377460	obvious lark as supersexual has received this kind of a pushback though, and it's that it punches a
377460	383100	huge hole in the intersectionalist self-definition is king type of ideology. This sort of thing has
383100	387740	been bubbling up in the lesbian community for a lot longer than anywhere else, where cis lesbians
387740	391940	have been told they're bigoted for not being interested in trans women, where lesbian exclusive
391940	396420	dating apps have opened the door to trans women in the name of diversity. I'm not opposed to any
396460	401100	of these people having sex or forming relationships with whoever they want for whatever reason, but if
401100	408180	to use the current meme terminology, a super lesbian wants to go on a dating app meant exclusively
408180	412900	for other super lesbians, that doesn't seem too objectionable to me. Remember, it's the right of
412900	417660	association, but not to some of these people. To them, it's instead the cotton ceiling. These
417660	423300	preferences must not be respected, but smashed through as if they were akin to the glass ceiling.
423300	428860	People who were radical leftist feminists a decade ago are now considered right-wing bigots due to
428860	433500	this shift in the discourse, and I gotta say it's been a wild ride watching it all go down. But
433500	438860	remember, identification is the name of the game. If you can pull out an entire book of newly defined
438860	444060	different sexualities to differentiate the minute granular differences between other types of sexual
444060	448860	preference, what is the basis for the objection to this one? I mean, in that list you'll find
448860	455820	scoliosexual, a sexual orientation that describes those who are sexually attracted to people with
455820	461700	non cisgender identities, such as people who are non-binary, genderqueer, or trans, otherwise known
461700	468020	as a chaser. Alright, if this exists, why is there such an overreaction to its opposite? Is it because
468020	472500	it's called super straight? Were the implication buried deep in there as that trans women aren't
472500	477980	women? Okay, well why don't we just rename it? What if we called it anti-scoliosexual? Maybe we
478020	483740	just call it femalesexual? Cissexual? If the complaint really is just the meme-like nature
483740	488820	of the name, like say, with trap, then there shouldn't be any problem with the action of men
488820	493180	actually excluding trans women from their pool of potential partners, however you want to call
493180	498820	that action. If genital preferences do have a huge impact on your sexuality, maybe look into
498820	506420	impresexual? What the? Alright. Impresexual is a term for those who have such specific sexual
506420	512100	preferences, it may feel as though it matters more than one's orientation itself. So this is
512100	517140	literally an LGBT friendly variant of super straight, where the sexual orientation is
517140	523580	whatever preference you have. Alright? The funniest bit is, this page was made by a trans person as a
523580	529020	non-transphobic alternative to super straight. It's already been rejected by feminist and lesbian
529020	535660	blogs. And over on reddit, r slash impresexual was made by a progressive who is currently trying to
535660	540380	popularize the term with other progressives. And other progressives are instead attacking them,
540380	545700	thinking that the idea was made as a parody by those feminist and lesbian blogs that have
545700	550380	rejected the idea. The amount of infighting happening over this dumb shit is amazing.
550380	556180	However, we all know why there's so much anger directed at what is obviously a troll-op. The
556180	560980	observed rules of intersectional theory have been that you can identify as a sexuality, slap a label
560980	567300	on it, and it's now valid. Heckin cute and valid in fact. By those same rules, there's no reason
567300	571900	you can't simply identify as super sexual, and claim to be oppressed whenever you receive criticism
571900	576220	of it. You can even point to any number of institutions that are explicitly pro-trans,
576220	580580	and announce that they systemically discriminate against you. Not because those institutions are
580580	586100	actually super phobic, but because they normalize and clandestinely promote super phobia through
586100	590660	their passive neutrality. There's no standing still on a moving train after all. You can even
590820	596540	make a blatant power play, and have Donkey Kong say super straight rights. Or anybody else, really.
596540	602780	Why not? It's the same thing as when trans activists shoehorn in their ideology in a place that is
602780	608740	explicitly non-political, under the argument of, this isn't politics, it's our existence. Okay,
608740	614780	it's all fair game then. And so there is no actual coherent argument when somebody comes along and
614780	619540	says, I identify as super straight. This is why they can only reply with either death threats,
619580	624860	or long threads that are immediately self contradictory, or end with, yeah you can do it,
624860	630260	I just don't like how you do it. Yes, super straight is obviously a joke, but the punchline
630260	635200	of the joke is everybody who got so mad about it, that they actually believe it was started by
635200	641500	neo-nazis as a 4chan op, in order to literally kill trans people literally, and not just a guy
641500	645940	making a tiktok in his car about his sexual preference. And there's been some good memes
645980	651220	and funny burns out of it, like that girl who said super straight is a mental disorder and got owned
651220	656740	by the dude replying with, it used to be, but we successfully harassed enough people in the American
656740	662420	Psychological Association to have it removed from the DSM-5. Damn dude. Whenever trans activists
662420	667500	bitch about straight men not being into them, it honestly sounds like the radical feminists,
667500	672100	who complain that gay men are only gay because they're misogynists. At the end of the day,
672100	676900	it's just another way to try and overwrite and invalidate somebody else's consent because you
676900	680220	want to fuck them and they don't want to fuck you. And we've seen this sort of thing before,
680220	685860	multiple times. Last year, it was the LGB Alliance, where some gay people wanted the
685860	691700	T out of LGBT, because the struggles that gays, lesbians, and bisexuals face are all related to
691700	696940	each other, and yet distinct from the struggles that trans people face. There is some intersectional
696940	701780	and lefty logic to this. In one of my university gender studies classes, I learned that the history
701780	707380	of the movement saw LGBT lumped in not out of a concrete shared solidarity, but because back in
707380	712340	the 1950s, there was a predominant view among the cishet patriarchal society that we live in that
712340	718700	gay men, pedophiles, transsexuals as they were called back then, cross dressers, and drag queens
718700	724100	were all the same thing, or at least had a lot of heavy overlap. The dominant culture did not
724100	728580	conceive of these things as fully separate and distinct, and so the activism surrounding them
728580	734180	emerged reflecting that. But it's 2021, and nowadays, forcing the LGB and the T together
734180	740020	artificially for that 1950s era reason sounds rather transphobic by our modern standards,
740020	746340	doesn't it? And the year before that, it was LGBTS, making the LGBT movement more inclusive
746340	751140	by adding S for straight. Because why not? It covers more people that way. And again,
751140	755700	by the rules of intersectionality, these are all valid identities that need protection and
755700	760340	acceptance from bigots. It even got to the point that Boston approved a straight pride
760340	765620	permit with the event's organizer, John Hugo, saying, We don't hate anyone. We just want to
765620	770500	have our own celebration, just like everybody else has a right to. All people from all communities
770500	775140	are welcome as long as they show respect. Each of these events are, on their face, ridiculous
775140	780180	and unnecessary. But every time one of them goes down, there is a contingent of always on Twitter
780180	785780	people who publicly and spectacularly self-destruct in waves of unbridled rage over
785780	791780	what your average disinterested, unengaged normie can clearly recognize as an obvious joke by internet
791780	796180	trolls meant to stir the pot. Intersectional activists are their own downfall. Every time
796180	800340	someone pokes fun at them, they publicly shit themselves. And the silent majority has been
800340	807060	watching it happen for years. LGBT activists are the reason that LGBT acceptance is on the decline.
807060	812420	In the end, if you actually identify as super straight, you're probably just an idiot getting
812420	817620	a bit too sucked into what's obviously this month's flash-in-the-pan meme. On the flip side,
817620	822420	if you're actually angry at super straight, well, you're the very reason it's going to keep happening.
