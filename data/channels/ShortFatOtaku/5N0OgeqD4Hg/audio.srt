1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,280
So, I missed the boat on this one a little bit, but super straight is a thing apparently.

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,120
With the representation flag of black, orange, and sometimes white, super straight people

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,800
are attracted to individuals of the opposite sex, excluding trans people. Of course, that

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,300
whole excluding thing has people up in arms because we're on the internet, so maybe I

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,980
can parse it a little bit better. If a trans woman is biologically male but adopts the

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,520
gender role of a woman, and that is how I understand it to be the case, then your average

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,760
straight man, by the intersectional definition, is somebody who is attracted to people who

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,700
adopt the gender role of woman, meaning cis women and trans women, regardless of their

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,880
biology. Okay, fair enough. If this is the case, then a super straight man is somebody

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,260
who is attracted to people who adopt the gender role of woman and have the biology of a female.

11
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,380
And I guess to simplify it, super straightness is being attracted to people whose biology

12
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,920
and gender role match, and who are the opposite of you in both respects. There we go. No more

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,920
use of the word excluding in the definition. No more exclusion. Is everybody happy now?

14
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,440
Yeah, I figured not. This whole super straight thing was started by a viral TikTok. Damn,

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,480
TikToks are still going viral. Maybe I should start one. Yo, guys, I made a new sexuality

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,080
now, actually. It's called super straight, okay? Since straight people or straight men

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,880
is myself, I get called transphobic because I wouldn't date a trans woman. You know, they're

18
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,720
like, would you date a trans woman? I'm like, no. Why? That's a female. No, like that's

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,160
not a real woman to me. Like I want a real woman. No, you're just transphobic. So now

20
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,040
I'm super straight. I only date the opposite gender, women that are born women. So you

21
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,880
can't say I'm transphobic now because that's just my sexuality, you know? And this spawned

22
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,840
a whole bunch of other people who were doing it, presumably just to troll. I'm super straight

23
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,880
and I'm proud. Just so you know, I support the super straights. I can't believe how heterophobic

24
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,800
people have gone. We just want our partner to be biologically clean and natural and we

25
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,000
still accept trans people and super phobia. Did you know that there's a lot of super people

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,160
are getting harassed and getting death threats every day? Stop the super phobia. Hashtag

27
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,880
super straight hate is real. That's what super straight means. Stop calling us homophobes.

28
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,080
Oh, look, the super straight community even raised $6,500 to benefit the Vancouver Rape

29
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,540
Relief Society. We care super straight. Like and retweet if you're super straight and proud.

30
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,840
And see, this is how it works. Here's a handy dandy guide. Learn the difference and stop

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,540
being a bigot. But of course, straightphobes do what all other phobes do. They rewrite

32
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,120
history and push their own ideology. Now you're a transphobe if you only date cis people and

33
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,160
not trans people of the opposite gender. Some of them just don't seem to understand that

34
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,520
you can be both a super straight ally and a trans ally. Fuck transphobia. Repost if

35
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,000
you're super phobic. Retweet if your account is not a safe space for super straight people.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,320
Stop the hate, guys. But it gets even worse. If I ever see anyone calling themselves a

37
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,480
super straight, I won't hesitate to kill them. I'm going to attack and kill anyone identifying

38
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,820
as super straight. I wish all super straight people an ugly evening. I'm coming for you.

39
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,480
The amount of open death threats against the super straight community is astronomical.

40
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,600
Of course, they outright admit that they believe super straight is transphobic because, say

41
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:47,120
it with me, it excludes trans people. And that is the first argument against the idea

42
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,480
of the super straight. It's an argument that predates super straight, in fact. It's that

43
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,960
if trans women are women, then refusing to date trans women as a straight man or as a

44
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:01,200
lesbian cis woman is transphobia. In other words, you don't see them as the gender they

45
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,480
identify as, and therefore you are rejecting their existence as that gender, and therefore

46
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,040
you're transphobic. Obviously, not all trans activists think this way. Certainly not all

47
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,200
trans people are saying a suck the dick bigot. But hey, that was a joke phrase just a few

48
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,080
years ago, and with this new reaction to super straight, as well as the corresponding super gay

49
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,480
and super lesbian, we're actually approaching that spot now. We're obviously just having a

50
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,320
laugh here, guys, but the underlying question beneath everything ultimately is, when do you

51
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,600
have the right to be prejudicial? Or do you at all? There is this assumption on the broader left

52
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,640
that prejudice is always bad, period. But we already have a good idea of what happens if you

53
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,520
take that position to its logical conclusion. As one of many examples, in Huxley's Brave New

54
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,000
World, the futuristic society of the world state prioritizes science, efficiency, and communal

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,080
ownership, and one of its mottos is, everyone belongs to everyone else. In this world, it is

56
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,920
illegal to reject any sexual advance from anyone else, because it's considered solipsistic,

57
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,400
discriminatory, and prejudicial. But to a liberal, and to our liberal society, which prioritizes

58
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,280
self-ownership, property, and speech, this idea is monstrous. We have the right to our prejudices

59
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,520
as part of the right of association. And while it might sound a little bit silly to have to say

60
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,000
this, if you've entered into an exclusive monogamous relationship, on some level that is the ultimate

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,720
prejudice. You've publicly declared that you're limiting your sexuality for you and your partner,

62
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,040
nobody else. In order to have that kind of relationship, you must, by necessity, discriminate

63
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,480
against everybody you're not with, in order to privilege your partner. And clearly we consider

64
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,320
this to be justifiable, because in order to operate in the world we have to rank order things in terms

65
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,720
of how they are valuable to us. We've even got biological brain structure set up to do this sort

66
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,520
of thing. Again, it feels weird that I have to say this, but everything is not the same about every

67
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,080
other thing all the time. Once again, we're back to the conversation about hierarchy and value,

68
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,920
because these concepts are inescapable to the human experience, and this is likely the source

69
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,180
of the heavy crossover between trans activism and radical socialism. Their shared disdain for the

70
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,180
concepts of value, preference, rank ordering, and hierarchy. There is a second reason that such an

71
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,460
obvious lark as supersexual has received this kind of a pushback though, and it's that it punches a

72
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:23,100
huge hole in the intersectionalist self-definition is king type of ideology. This sort of thing has

73
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,740
been bubbling up in the lesbian community for a lot longer than anywhere else, where cis lesbians

74
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,940
have been told they're bigoted for not being interested in trans women, where lesbian exclusive

75
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,420
dating apps have opened the door to trans women in the name of diversity. I'm not opposed to any

76
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,100
of these people having sex or forming relationships with whoever they want for whatever reason, but if

77
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:48,180
to use the current meme terminology, a super lesbian wants to go on a dating app meant exclusively

78
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,900
for other super lesbians, that doesn't seem too objectionable to me. Remember, it's the right of

79
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,660
association, but not to some of these people. To them, it's instead the cotton ceiling. These

80
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:03,300
preferences must not be respected, but smashed through as if they were akin to the glass ceiling.

81
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,860
People who were radical leftist feminists a decade ago are now considered right-wing bigots due to

82
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,500
this shift in the discourse, and I gotta say it's been a wild ride watching it all go down. But

83
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,860
remember, identification is the name of the game. If you can pull out an entire book of newly defined

84
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,060
different sexualities to differentiate the minute granular differences between other types of sexual

85
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,860
preference, what is the basis for the objection to this one? I mean, in that list you'll find

86
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:35,820
scoliosexual, a sexual orientation that describes those who are sexually attracted to people with

87
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:41,700
non cisgender identities, such as people who are non-binary, genderqueer, or trans, otherwise known

88
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:48,020
as a chaser. Alright, if this exists, why is there such an overreaction to its opposite? Is it because

89
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,500
it's called super straight? Were the implication buried deep in there as that trans women aren't

90
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,980
women? Okay, well why don't we just rename it? What if we called it anti-scoliosexual? Maybe we

91
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:03,740
just call it femalesexual? Cissexual? If the complaint really is just the meme-like nature

92
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,820
of the name, like say, with trap, then there shouldn't be any problem with the action of men

93
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,180
actually excluding trans women from their pool of potential partners, however you want to call

94
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,820
that action. If genital preferences do have a huge impact on your sexuality, maybe look into

95
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:26,420
impresexual? What the? Alright. Impresexual is a term for those who have such specific sexual

96
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:32,100
preferences, it may feel as though it matters more than one's orientation itself. So this is

97
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:37,140
literally an LGBT friendly variant of super straight, where the sexual orientation is

98
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:43,580
whatever preference you have. Alright? The funniest bit is, this page was made by a trans person as a

99
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:49,020
non-transphobic alternative to super straight. It's already been rejected by feminist and lesbian

100
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:55,660
blogs. And over on reddit, r slash impresexual was made by a progressive who is currently trying to

101
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,380
popularize the term with other progressives. And other progressives are instead attacking them,

102
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:05,700
thinking that the idea was made as a parody by those feminist and lesbian blogs that have

103
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,380
rejected the idea. The amount of infighting happening over this dumb shit is amazing.

104
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:16,180
However, we all know why there's so much anger directed at what is obviously a troll-op. The

105
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,980
observed rules of intersectional theory have been that you can identify as a sexuality, slap a label

106
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:27,300
on it, and it's now valid. Heckin cute and valid in fact. By those same rules, there's no reason

107
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,900
you can't simply identify as super sexual, and claim to be oppressed whenever you receive criticism

108
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,220
of it. You can even point to any number of institutions that are explicitly pro-trans,

109
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,580
and announce that they systemically discriminate against you. Not because those institutions are

110
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:46,100
actually super phobic, but because they normalize and clandestinely promote super phobia through

111
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,660
their passive neutrality. There's no standing still on a moving train after all. You can even

112
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:56,540
make a blatant power play, and have Donkey Kong say super straight rights. Or anybody else, really.

113
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:02,780
Why not? It's the same thing as when trans activists shoehorn in their ideology in a place that is

114
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:08,740
explicitly non-political, under the argument of, this isn't politics, it's our existence. Okay,

115
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:14,780
it's all fair game then. And so there is no actual coherent argument when somebody comes along and

116
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,540
says, I identify as super straight. This is why they can only reply with either death threats,

117
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,860
or long threads that are immediately self contradictory, or end with, yeah you can do it,

118
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:30,260
I just don't like how you do it. Yes, super straight is obviously a joke, but the punchline

119
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,200
of the joke is everybody who got so mad about it, that they actually believe it was started by

120
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,500
neo-nazis as a 4chan op, in order to literally kill trans people literally, and not just a guy

121
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,940
making a tiktok in his car about his sexual preference. And there's been some good memes

122
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,220
and funny burns out of it, like that girl who said super straight is a mental disorder and got owned

123
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,740
by the dude replying with, it used to be, but we successfully harassed enough people in the American

124
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,420
Psychological Association to have it removed from the DSM-5. Damn dude. Whenever trans activists

125
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,500
bitch about straight men not being into them, it honestly sounds like the radical feminists,

126
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,100
who complain that gay men are only gay because they're misogynists. At the end of the day,

127
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,900
it's just another way to try and overwrite and invalidate somebody else's consent because you

128
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,220
want to fuck them and they don't want to fuck you. And we've seen this sort of thing before,

129
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,860
multiple times. Last year, it was the LGB Alliance, where some gay people wanted the

130
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:31,700
T out of LGBT, because the struggles that gays, lesbians, and bisexuals face are all related to

131
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,940
each other, and yet distinct from the struggles that trans people face. There is some intersectional

132
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,780
and lefty logic to this. In one of my university gender studies classes, I learned that the history

133
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:47,380
of the movement saw LGBT lumped in not out of a concrete shared solidarity, but because back in

134
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:52,340
the 1950s, there was a predominant view among the cishet patriarchal society that we live in that

135
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:58,700
gay men, pedophiles, transsexuals as they were called back then, cross dressers, and drag queens

136
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:04,100
were all the same thing, or at least had a lot of heavy overlap. The dominant culture did not

137
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,580
conceive of these things as fully separate and distinct, and so the activism surrounding them

138
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:14,180
emerged reflecting that. But it's 2021, and nowadays, forcing the LGB and the T together

139
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:20,020
artificially for that 1950s era reason sounds rather transphobic by our modern standards,

140
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:26,340
doesn't it? And the year before that, it was LGBTS, making the LGBT movement more inclusive

141
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,140
by adding S for straight. Because why not? It covers more people that way. And again,

142
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,700
by the rules of intersectionality, these are all valid identities that need protection and

143
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,340
acceptance from bigots. It even got to the point that Boston approved a straight pride

144
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:45,620
permit with the event's organizer, John Hugo, saying, We don't hate anyone. We just want to

145
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:50,500
have our own celebration, just like everybody else has a right to. All people from all communities

146
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,140
are welcome as long as they show respect. Each of these events are, on their face, ridiculous

147
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,180
and unnecessary. But every time one of them goes down, there is a contingent of always on Twitter

148
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,780
people who publicly and spectacularly self-destruct in waves of unbridled rage over

149
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:11,780
what your average disinterested, unengaged normie can clearly recognize as an obvious joke by internet

150
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:16,180
trolls meant to stir the pot. Intersectional activists are their own downfall. Every time

151
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,340
someone pokes fun at them, they publicly shit themselves. And the silent majority has been

152
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:27,060
watching it happen for years. LGBT activists are the reason that LGBT acceptance is on the decline.

153
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,420
In the end, if you actually identify as super straight, you're probably just an idiot getting

154
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,620
a bit too sucked into what's obviously this month's flash-in-the-pan meme. On the flip side,

155
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,420
if you're actually angry at super straight, well, you're the very reason it's going to keep happening.

156
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,860
Thank you for watching, my friends. If you enjoyed this video, please feel free to share it around

157
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,180
and do all of the other algorithm-positive stuff that the YouTube engagement metrics like,

158
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,660
I don't know. Sub for more or hit up my Patreon or SubscribeStar if you want to keep it coming.

159
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,020
And be sure to stick around, because I'm putting up a new video every single day.

160
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,260
So I'll see you tomorrow. I love you.
