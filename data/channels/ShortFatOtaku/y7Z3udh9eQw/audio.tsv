0	10520	A year ago, I did a video called The Identification with Evil, which on its surface was about
10520	15060	the new guy meme, while the actual meat of the video was about how the constant drive
15060	20000	towards equality that comes out of the left causes people to not only excuse evil, but
20000	25240	to become evil themselves, to advocate for and commit evil acts, because good and evil
25240	29700	are ideas that, when you boil it down, change depending on who's viewing the scene.
29700	33740	And there's no reason for them to privilege any one person's view over anybody else's.
33740	37860	Meaning, when your average person reads the original new guy comic, it seems like the
37860	42580	new guy is the good person in the situation, and the purple haired SJW midget is the evil
42580	43580	person.
43580	46760	When the new guy says, how would you like it if somebody stole from you, he's appealing
46760	48140	to a specific moral framework.
48140	52260	A society that values property rights will consider stealing immoral, no matter who's
52260	56140	doing the stealing and who the victim is, because you wouldn't want to be stolen from,
56140	57980	therefore you should not steal from other people.
57980	61700	Meanwhile the purple haired thinks it's okay to steal from Pewdiepie, yes the comic's reference
61700	66100	to when Pewdiepie's house got broken into, because he's rich, he's white, he's a gamer,
66100	67100	etc etc.
67100	71360	She has a moral system where these intrinsic qualities of the victim means that it's good
71360	72420	to steal from them.
72420	76220	The author of the comic herself is a social justice warrior, and she intended for the
76220	80420	new guy to come off as entirely unreasonable, the fact that the public's overwhelming reaction
80420	84900	to it was to side with the new guy, to the point that he became a meme, is a testament
84900	88760	to just how dislodged from reality the author actually was.
88760	90460	But what makes her wrong?
90460	94060	Why shouldn't we accept her position to be just as equal as his?
94060	96780	And no I'm not just bringing up an old meme for the fun of it.
96780	101460	If you spent any time on tumblr before the great migration from tumblr to twitter, you'll
101460	104960	notice that fandom communities are the most toxic things around.
104960	108820	If you like the wrong shows or movies, you're problematic and a bigot, if you play a video
108820	112780	game the wrong way, you're problematic and a bigot, ship the wrong characters together,
112780	117400	that is, believe that person X and person Y in the show or whatever would make a good
117400	120220	romantic couple, and you're problematic and a bigot.
120220	124160	Yesterday this thread went v- I knew you would lock your account, I was right to archive
124160	125160	this thread.
125160	129260	This thread went viral, and it's long and cancerous, but it's worth talking about.
129260	133780	This card does such a good job explaining why pro-shipping is bad holy shit, I am now
133780	138400	going to have to fill your brain with some absolutely useless information, I apologize
138400	139400	in advance.
139400	144880	Pro-shipping is when a person respects other people's fictional romantic pairings regardless
144880	147500	of their own personal feelings toward that pairing.
147500	153220	So for example, let's say you don't like the idea of Rey and Kylo Ren as a romantic pairing
153220	154760	in the Star Wars sequels.
154760	157720	Let's say personally you'd prefer that Rey get together with Finn.
157720	161240	Now let's say your friend prefers Rey and Kylo together.
161240	166160	If you're a pro-shipper, you are declaring that you will not harass your friend over
166160	171840	your difference of opinion regarding who Rey should get with.
171840	177380	This person is saying that pro-shipping, that lack of harassment over differences of opinion
177380	181320	regarding fictional romantic pairings, is a bad thing.
181320	186680	So this card does such a good job explaining why pro-shipping is bad, let's see their position.
186680	191120	I'm going to paraphrase it, because to be honest, my life is short enough already without
191120	194260	spending even more time reading all of this out to you.
194260	195640	Representation doesn't affect reality.
195640	198360	If that were true, representation wouldn't matter.
198360	203440	And if we accept representation in media matters, then representing, say, adults with children
203440	208520	like with loli art, normalizes pedophilic abuse and grants pedos platforms.
208520	212540	Therefore art actively harms victims and validates abusers.
212540	214180	People can ship who they want.
214180	216680	Why do you want to ship ancestor pedophilia?
216680	220660	Even if it's fictional, your ship of them says you justify those actions.
220660	226460	Letting people ship who they want justifies racist and LGBT-phobic caricatures.
226460	229820	And this is like people using memes to recruit kids to the alt-right.
229820	231640	I'm coping with my own trauma.
231640	234460	Then you should be sensitive of how your ship traumatizes others.
234460	235640	You're censoring us.
235640	240060	You dogpile creators and threaten them offline for making nessa and pokemon the wrong shade
240060	241060	of brown.
241060	245700	If you use your artistic expression to say bad things, it is only natural to deplatform
245700	246700	you.
246700	250900	Considering our righteous anger as abusive is an alt-right dogwhistle.
250900	255260	Because racists who commonly present their racism always claim the moral high ground
255260	258020	over bipoc people who are angry at their racism.
258020	260020	It's not my responsibility.
260020	264220	You expect traumatized people to jump through hoops to avoid being retraumatized?
264220	266180	No the onus is on you to self-censor.
266180	271140	I'm only ironically racist for the memes leads to it's only fictional pedophilia
271140	275940	and incest and rape leads to it's only online white supremacy.
275940	281340	Therefore we should stop it all at the source.
281340	286300	Maybe you noticed while I was going through all that but on some level both sides of this
286300	290660	argument are cancerous and the correct response to the whole thing is fuck off.
290660	295180	It's certainly weird when an artist draws loli and I don't approve personally but
295180	297300	I would never censor somebody who does it.
297300	298700	How did we get to this point though?
298700	303020	Where the types of art you consume or create are not only a barometer of whether or not
303020	307540	you're secretly a bigot but actually it's own vector of oppression like race or gender
307540	308540	or class.
308540	312300	Let's go back to the source, what is the philosophical underpinning for legal equality
312300	314140	between people of different races?
314140	318300	Well in the western liberal sense it's that being of another race, let's talk from
318300	322580	an American perspective and use black, it's that being black is an immutable characteristic
322580	325680	and doesn't directly affect the behavior of the individual.
325680	329280	So it would be immoral to treat white and black people differently as neither of them
329280	332980	can help what race they are and it doesn't actually matter in the end as long as they're
332980	334520	behavior is the same.
334520	339880	This same logic was used in my opinion correctly to advocate for gay marriage, again being
339880	344580	gay is an immutable characteristic and doesn't directly affect the behavior of the individual.
344580	348100	Now you can make a slight argument here that there is a difference in behavior because
348100	351460	gay sex and straight sex are not the same thing but when it comes to the institution
351460	355520	of marriage, people devoting themselves to each other exclusively, becoming a stable
355520	359300	unit for the purposes of companionship lasting beyond just sexual pleasure where there's
359300	363860	love and long-term decision-making and pooling of resources and all the other things that
363860	368060	make it an ideal environment to raise children, there is no reason for gay people not to have
368060	369620	access to this institution.
369620	373700	In other words, if gay people can enter into a monogamous relationship, devote themselves
373700	378180	to each other and do all of those stabilizing behaviors that create a healthy household,
378180	382740	there is no reason they shouldn't be allowed to raise children even if there's real differences
382740	384320	between them and straight people.
384320	389140	Same with trans people, if the stability is there, there's no reason a cis man and a
389140	393300	cis woman can't get married and raise kids in a mainly traditional manner despite the
393300	398180	obvious non-traditionalness of their relationship because an individual's positive habits
398180	401100	are more important than their immutable characteristics.
401100	404840	Everything sounds good so far, at least to me, but as you continue through the progressive
404840	407200	stack we start to hit roadblocks.
407200	409260	What about fatphobia and thin oppression?
409260	413140	I did a video laughing at the idea a little bit ago but let's seriously think it over.
413140	414940	Can fat people be oppressed?
414940	416860	Using intersectionalist logic, certainly.
416860	421140	But is being fat an immutable characteristic like being black, gay or trans?
421140	422560	Well, of course not.
422560	426340	Some people have hormonal issues that make it so that their rate of gaining or losing
426340	427400	weight is different.
427400	430340	Some people are injured and therefore they can't work out as easily.
430340	433260	Some people are legitimately traumatized and they use eating to cope.
433260	437060	But all of these issues are ultimately secondary to calories in, calories out.
437060	441340	If you put a fat person on a deserted island, I don't care what hormonal issues they have,
441340	443320	they will lose weight as they starve.
443320	446400	Hormonal issues do not override the laws of thermodynamics.
446400	450780	The formula we've been using is that if a certain quality about a person is an immutable
450780	456080	characteristic and it does not directly affect their behavior, then it is immoral to discriminate
456080	457680	against them for that quality.
457680	459960	Where does fatphobia come into this conversation?
459960	463960	It's not immutable, though it can be hard to change, and there's certainly the possibility
463960	466840	of direct changes in behavior due to being fat.
466840	469160	So is it reasonable to discriminate against them?
469160	473520	Well, what we've been talking about so far is the liberal conception of discrimination,
473520	477200	centered on the individual, their rights, their choices, their behaviors.
477200	481520	And this is also why all of the civil rights victories I've been describing have been fundamentally
481520	482920	liberal in origin.
482920	485300	They're all rooted in that individualist philosophy.
485300	489600	It doesn't matter if I'm black or gay or trans, as long as I can get the job done, is the
489600	490600	liberal view.
490600	492340	It's what you do, not who you are.
492340	496100	The socialist conception of discrimination is completely antithetical to this.
496100	501200	It does not care about immutable characteristics or personal behaviors, though socialists may
501200	503740	sometimes pay lip service to those ideas.
503740	507240	The socialist conception of discrimination is rooted in the power differential between
507240	508480	groups of people.
508480	513060	It's all class conflict, it's all power politics, it's all proletariat and bourgeoisie.
513060	517000	It's bad to be racist towards black people not because of immutable characteristics or
517000	521960	lack of difference in behavior, but because white people have power and black people don't.
521960	524960	That is a key difference between liberalism and socialism.
524960	528840	A big problem with the socialist view is that this analysis can apply to anything.
528840	532540	It's the powerful whites versus the oppressed blacks, the powerful straights versus the
532540	536160	oppressed gays, the powerful thins versus the oppressed fats.
536160	539880	All it takes for this analysis to work is for you to be able to identify a class of
539880	545040	people as existing and then self-identify within that class, and now all of a sudden
545040	546560	you are discriminated against.
546560	551800	The act of identifying as a thing, not simply liking a thing, but pulling it into yourself
551800	557260	and making it a part of your will, grants the person that paradoxical privilege of considering
557260	558800	themselves oppressed.
558800	565160	So for example, if you identify as non-binary and somebody critiques the idea of non-binary,
565160	567140	that is an attack against you.
567140	571160	You are being discriminated against, because this quality that is being discussed has become
571160	572700	a component of your soul.
572700	577960	So let's say you were to identify as a Ray Kylo shipper, as in, taken that stance on
577960	582680	Star Wars into your identity and treated it the way that a liberal would treat an immutable
582680	583680	characteristic.
583680	586740	And yes, these tumblrite people do in fact do this.
586740	590940	Even somebody who disagrees with that Ray Kylo ship, or who promotes a different ship,
590940	593420	can be properly viewed as discriminating against you.
593420	598400	I know this sounds completely wild and out there, but it's actually not far off from
598400	600900	how religious people fit into intersectionality.
600900	605560	The radical Muslim can, and often does, use this framework to claim that he's oppressed
605560	608740	if you don't convert to his religion, and follow his rules.
608740	612860	That's how he can claim bigotry if two gay men walk down the street holding hands while
612860	613860	he's around.
613860	617700	This logic is also used by people in the kink community, where not only do people come out
617700	623100	as gay or trans now, but they also come out as being into a specific kink.
623100	626660	And the most extreme among them will tell you that if you disapprove of their kink,
626660	631740	you know, kink shaming, or even worse, don't share their kink, you're being oppressive
631740	632740	towards them.
632740	636520	You've also got people who have legitimate traumatic experiences, but have chosen to
636520	639140	identify with them rather than work them out.
639140	643420	And remember, that means pulling them into yourself, which in the case of trauma is quite
643420	644420	unhealthy.
644420	648560	How do you expect to improve your depression, your anxiety, your PTSD, if you make those
648560	651140	things an integral part of your personality?
651140	653320	And yes, pedophiles do this too.
653320	658280	Why do you think they now identify as minor attracted persons, worded as if it is their
658280	661620	own biology oppressing them and they're helpless to resist?
661620	666180	All of these people are appealing to the liberal sensibility that if a thing is an immutable
666180	670100	characteristic, then criticizing them for it is discrimination.
670100	672260	But it's just socialist sleight of hand.
672260	674660	Because underneath the surface, it's all power politics.
674660	679260	Sargon did an excellent podcast on this topic over on his Lotus Eaters channel, but unfortunately
679260	681820	it's a premium one, so you're just going to have to go and pay for it if you want to
681820	682820	hear it.
682820	685320	And I'm not going to republish it wholesale because it's not fair to him, but I do have
685320	687460	to lean on it a little bit for this topic.
687460	692420	Part of that podcast talks about the universalization of morality, meaning that for a moral system
692420	696580	to be truly universal, it's not enough that you consider the other person's position.
696580	699900	As in, I shouldn't steal because I wouldn't want the other person to steal from me.
699900	703420	You must also consider the other person's position from his own ethical system to be
703420	704500	truly universal.
704500	709960	As in, his moral position must have just as much weight in your eyes as your moral position.
709960	713500	You must be able to say that while you don't agree with the radical Muslim who wants to
713500	718000	kill gay people, you understand that he is Muslim and from his position, killing gay
718000	721740	people is a moral good and that that position is just as valid as yours.
721740	724340	That is what the universalization of morality demands.
724340	728500	In other words, if you must craft a moral system that covers both you and this radical
728500	733340	Muslim, what moral injunctions would that system include that covers both of you while
733340	736460	simultaneously violating neither of your moral codes?
736460	739020	It turns out almost none because you have almost nothing in common.
739020	743540	And if you must have a moral framework that covers all seven point whatever billion human
743540	747860	beings, you will discover that that universal moral framework has nothing to say at all.
747860	752180	This is why leftists always end up fetishizing the barbaric practices of other cultures while
752180	756000	simultaneously claiming that the West has no culture of its own because what they view
756000	759680	as true Western culture is this universalizing process.
759680	763480	They have no objection to the Muslim because to him, instituting Sharia law is a moral
763480	764480	good.
764480	767680	They have no objection to the pedophile because from his position, he is good to do what he
767680	768680	does.
768680	772400	And when something inevitably goes wrong, when this system inevitably fails, they must
772400	776760	blame everything but the individual, society, culture, white supremacy, the police, their
776760	780840	parents, whatever, because to hold the individual accountable for their actions is to imply
780840	785160	that the liberal position, that the values of our culture actually hold some weight.
785160	789640	This is why almost every single martyr that Black Lives Matter holds up seems to have
789640	790820	a spotty past.
790820	795520	Or why Kyle Rittenhouse can shoot three leftist agitators attacking him and randomly manage
795520	798580	to hit a rapist, a pedophile, and a wife beater.
798580	803080	Or why whenever we see the mugshots and records of various anti-fariators, they always end
803080	804360	up being thugs.
804360	807380	This is also why cancel culture is fundamentally a leftist idea.
807380	812520	To say one thing wrong, one bad tweet, one misspoken sentence, one drop of wrongthink
812520	816780	is to cast doubt not only on that specific instance of the moment, but to oppose the
816780	820940	entire moral framework that they've built up, where we are all obligated to grant an
820940	823320	equal moral weighting to everybody's point of view.
823320	827240	And of course, if the Christians are wrong and there is no true objective morality as
827240	831800	enforced by God, then it only makes sense that this would be the final end of socialist
831800	832800	thought.
832800	833800	Everybody's equal.
833800	836980	Everybody's moral position intrinsically holds no value over anybody else's.
836980	839160	Nobody has the authority to judge anybody else.
839160	843840	And so, the morals of such a society must necessarily be no morals at all.
843840	848160	Such a society has no reason to ban political violence and in fact may deify it.
848160	851320	Such a society even has no reason to ban sex with children.
851320	855100	The consequentialists among the left will complain on the basis of bad outcomes, but
855100	860280	even they have no method to determine that what they consider to be a bad outcome isn't
860280	862720	considered a good outcome to the person committing that act.
862720	867020	And since that person's position must hold just as much moral weight as them, they will
867020	868560	simply be swept aside.
868560	873640	And certainly, such a society would allow you to identify with your own cultural consumption
873640	875480	and make it an intrinsic part of you.
875480	878800	Being a man-child sitting around a bunch of Star Wars figurines talking about the latest
878800	883680	Marvel movie is not simply a hobby, it's your personality, it's your identity, to
883680	888040	the point that violating it in any way is akin to being a racist or a sexist.
888040	891040	And there is no leftist argument against this.
891040	895300	Not within socialism, not within social justice, not within intersectionality.
895300	900380	The end result of their ideas is that everyone has an equal moral weight to everyone else.
900380	905020	And if the Marvel nerd wants to say that that's where his moral weighting lies to him, who
905020	906260	are you to complain?
906260	910260	This is how you get those terminally online smooth brains who will say that criticism
910260	914700	is bullying because their consumption is their identity, and therefore it's a moral good
914700	918620	that they cheer for Disney as a corporation and that your opposition to Disney is just
918620	919840	bigotry towards them.
919840	924780	As weird as it may seem for somebody who only has a surface knowledge of socialism's ethics,
924780	929100	yes, there's actually multiple links between socialism and corporatism.
929100	933540	And yes, as I've just shown, demanding that your identity be considered sacred is one
933540	934620	of those links.
934620	938900	The only real counter to this whole thing, as far as I can see, is to actually have some
938900	941820	standards and stick by them, even when times get tough.
941820	945420	To be brave enough to tell somebody when they're doing something wrong that they are in fact
945420	946480	doing something wrong.
946480	950160	We can discuss where the source of that sense of right and wrong comes from in a future
950160	952760	video, because I don't think it lies in religion.
952760	954740	But for now, I'll just leave you with this.
954740	956320	It's generally good to be polite.
956320	960780	If somebody asks you to respect some aspect of themselves and it costs you nothing, and
960780	964660	you want to maintain that connection with them, then there's no real harm in doing it.
964660	969140	But if someone demands it from you, or if their request makes no outward sense, or if
969140	974060	they get irrationally angry when you refuse or question them, then you know it is a power
974060	975060	play.
975060	976640	And now you know why they're doing it.
976640	980380	You know what the power is, you know where it leads, and you know that you should absolutely
980380	981380	deny them.
981380	985220	It's not just words, it's not just being respectful or being polite or making people
985220	986220	feel safe.
986220	990460	It is an active attempt by them to erode your own morality.
990460	994560	And if you value your character, you shouldn't let them do it.
