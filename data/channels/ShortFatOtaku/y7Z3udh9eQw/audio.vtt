00:00.000 --> 00:10.520
A year ago, I did a video called The Identification with Evil, which on its surface was about

00:10.520 --> 00:15.060
the new guy meme, while the actual meat of the video was about how the constant drive

00:15.060 --> 00:20.000
towards equality that comes out of the left causes people to not only excuse evil, but

00:20.000 --> 00:25.240
to become evil themselves, to advocate for and commit evil acts, because good and evil

00:25.240 --> 00:29.700
are ideas that, when you boil it down, change depending on who's viewing the scene.

00:29.700 --> 00:33.740
And there's no reason for them to privilege any one person's view over anybody else's.

00:33.740 --> 00:37.860
Meaning, when your average person reads the original new guy comic, it seems like the

00:37.860 --> 00:42.580
new guy is the good person in the situation, and the purple haired SJW midget is the evil

00:42.580 --> 00:43.580
person.

00:43.580 --> 00:46.760
When the new guy says, how would you like it if somebody stole from you, he's appealing

00:46.760 --> 00:48.140
to a specific moral framework.

00:48.140 --> 00:52.260
A society that values property rights will consider stealing immoral, no matter who's

00:52.260 --> 00:56.140
doing the stealing and who the victim is, because you wouldn't want to be stolen from,

00:56.140 --> 00:57.980
therefore you should not steal from other people.

00:57.980 --> 01:01.700
Meanwhile the purple haired thinks it's okay to steal from Pewdiepie, yes the comic's reference

01:01.700 --> 01:06.100
to when Pewdiepie's house got broken into, because he's rich, he's white, he's a gamer,

01:06.100 --> 01:07.100
etc etc.

01:07.100 --> 01:11.360
She has a moral system where these intrinsic qualities of the victim means that it's good

01:11.360 --> 01:12.420
to steal from them.

01:12.420 --> 01:16.220
The author of the comic herself is a social justice warrior, and she intended for the

01:16.220 --> 01:20.420
new guy to come off as entirely unreasonable, the fact that the public's overwhelming reaction

01:20.420 --> 01:24.900
to it was to side with the new guy, to the point that he became a meme, is a testament

01:24.900 --> 01:28.760
to just how dislodged from reality the author actually was.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.460
But what makes her wrong?

01:30.460 --> 01:34.060
Why shouldn't we accept her position to be just as equal as his?

01:34.060 --> 01:36.780
And no I'm not just bringing up an old meme for the fun of it.

01:36.780 --> 01:41.460
If you spent any time on tumblr before the great migration from tumblr to twitter, you'll

01:41.460 --> 01:44.960
notice that fandom communities are the most toxic things around.

01:44.960 --> 01:48.820
If you like the wrong shows or movies, you're problematic and a bigot, if you play a video

01:48.820 --> 01:52.780
game the wrong way, you're problematic and a bigot, ship the wrong characters together,

01:52.780 --> 01:57.400
that is, believe that person X and person Y in the show or whatever would make a good

01:57.400 --> 02:00.220
romantic couple, and you're problematic and a bigot.

02:00.220 --> 02:04.160
Yesterday this thread went v- I knew you would lock your account, I was right to archive

02:04.160 --> 02:05.160
this thread.

02:05.160 --> 02:09.260
This thread went viral, and it's long and cancerous, but it's worth talking about.

02:09.260 --> 02:13.780
This card does such a good job explaining why pro-shipping is bad holy shit, I am now

02:13.780 --> 02:18.400
going to have to fill your brain with some absolutely useless information, I apologize

02:18.400 --> 02:19.400
in advance.

02:19.400 --> 02:24.880
Pro-shipping is when a person respects other people's fictional romantic pairings regardless

02:24.880 --> 02:27.500
of their own personal feelings toward that pairing.

02:27.500 --> 02:33.220
So for example, let's say you don't like the idea of Rey and Kylo Ren as a romantic pairing

02:33.220 --> 02:34.760
in the Star Wars sequels.

02:34.760 --> 02:37.720
Let's say personally you'd prefer that Rey get together with Finn.

02:37.720 --> 02:41.240
Now let's say your friend prefers Rey and Kylo together.

02:41.240 --> 02:46.160
If you're a pro-shipper, you are declaring that you will not harass your friend over

02:46.160 --> 02:51.840
your difference of opinion regarding who Rey should get with.

02:51.840 --> 02:57.380
This person is saying that pro-shipping, that lack of harassment over differences of opinion

02:57.380 --> 03:01.320
regarding fictional romantic pairings, is a bad thing.

03:01.320 --> 03:06.680
So this card does such a good job explaining why pro-shipping is bad, let's see their position.

03:06.680 --> 03:11.120
I'm going to paraphrase it, because to be honest, my life is short enough already without

03:11.120 --> 03:14.260
spending even more time reading all of this out to you.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.640
Representation doesn't affect reality.

03:15.640 --> 03:18.360
If that were true, representation wouldn't matter.

03:18.360 --> 03:23.440
And if we accept representation in media matters, then representing, say, adults with children

03:23.440 --> 03:28.520
like with loli art, normalizes pedophilic abuse and grants pedos platforms.

03:28.520 --> 03:32.540
Therefore art actively harms victims and validates abusers.

03:32.540 --> 03:34.180
People can ship who they want.

03:34.180 --> 03:36.680
Why do you want to ship ancestor pedophilia?

03:36.680 --> 03:40.660
Even if it's fictional, your ship of them says you justify those actions.

03:40.660 --> 03:46.460
Letting people ship who they want justifies racist and LGBT-phobic caricatures.

03:46.460 --> 03:49.820
And this is like people using memes to recruit kids to the alt-right.

03:49.820 --> 03:51.640
I'm coping with my own trauma.

03:51.640 --> 03:54.460
Then you should be sensitive of how your ship traumatizes others.

03:54.460 --> 03:55.640
You're censoring us.

03:55.640 --> 04:00.060
You dogpile creators and threaten them offline for making nessa and pokemon the wrong shade

04:00.060 --> 04:01.060
of brown.

04:01.060 --> 04:05.700
If you use your artistic expression to say bad things, it is only natural to deplatform

04:05.700 --> 04:06.700
you.

04:06.700 --> 04:10.900
Considering our righteous anger as abusive is an alt-right dogwhistle.

04:10.900 --> 04:15.260
Because racists who commonly present their racism always claim the moral high ground

04:15.260 --> 04:18.020
over bipoc people who are angry at their racism.

04:18.020 --> 04:20.020
It's not my responsibility.

04:20.020 --> 04:24.220
You expect traumatized people to jump through hoops to avoid being retraumatized?

04:24.220 --> 04:26.180
No the onus is on you to self-censor.

04:26.180 --> 04:31.140
I'm only ironically racist for the memes leads to it's only fictional pedophilia

04:31.140 --> 04:35.940
and incest and rape leads to it's only online white supremacy.

04:35.940 --> 04:41.340
Therefore we should stop it all at the source.

04:41.340 --> 04:46.300
Maybe you noticed while I was going through all that but on some level both sides of this

04:46.300 --> 04:50.660
argument are cancerous and the correct response to the whole thing is fuck off.

04:50.660 --> 04:55.180
It's certainly weird when an artist draws loli and I don't approve personally but

04:55.180 --> 04:57.300
I would never censor somebody who does it.

04:57.300 --> 04:58.700
How did we get to this point though?

04:58.700 --> 05:03.020
Where the types of art you consume or create are not only a barometer of whether or not

05:03.020 --> 05:07.540
you're secretly a bigot but actually it's own vector of oppression like race or gender

05:07.540 --> 05:08.540
or class.

05:08.540 --> 05:12.300
Let's go back to the source, what is the philosophical underpinning for legal equality

05:12.300 --> 05:14.140
between people of different races?

05:14.140 --> 05:18.300
Well in the western liberal sense it's that being of another race, let's talk from

05:18.300 --> 05:22.580
an American perspective and use black, it's that being black is an immutable characteristic

05:22.580 --> 05:25.680
and doesn't directly affect the behavior of the individual.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.280
So it would be immoral to treat white and black people differently as neither of them

05:29.280 --> 05:32.980
can help what race they are and it doesn't actually matter in the end as long as they're

05:32.980 --> 05:34.520
behavior is the same.

05:34.520 --> 05:39.880
This same logic was used in my opinion correctly to advocate for gay marriage, again being

05:39.880 --> 05:44.580
gay is an immutable characteristic and doesn't directly affect the behavior of the individual.

05:44.580 --> 05:48.100
Now you can make a slight argument here that there is a difference in behavior because

05:48.100 --> 05:51.460
gay sex and straight sex are not the same thing but when it comes to the institution

05:51.460 --> 05:55.520
of marriage, people devoting themselves to each other exclusively, becoming a stable

05:55.520 --> 05:59.300
unit for the purposes of companionship lasting beyond just sexual pleasure where there's

05:59.300 --> 06:03.860
love and long-term decision-making and pooling of resources and all the other things that

06:03.860 --> 06:08.060
make it an ideal environment to raise children, there is no reason for gay people not to have

06:08.060 --> 06:09.620
access to this institution.

06:09.620 --> 06:13.700
In other words, if gay people can enter into a monogamous relationship, devote themselves

06:13.700 --> 06:18.180
to each other and do all of those stabilizing behaviors that create a healthy household,

06:18.180 --> 06:22.740
there is no reason they shouldn't be allowed to raise children even if there's real differences

06:22.740 --> 06:24.320
between them and straight people.

06:24.320 --> 06:29.140
Same with trans people, if the stability is there, there's no reason a cis man and a

06:29.140 --> 06:33.300
cis woman can't get married and raise kids in a mainly traditional manner despite the

06:33.300 --> 06:38.180
obvious non-traditionalness of their relationship because an individual's positive habits

06:38.180 --> 06:41.100
are more important than their immutable characteristics.

06:41.100 --> 06:44.840
Everything sounds good so far, at least to me, but as you continue through the progressive

06:44.840 --> 06:47.200
stack we start to hit roadblocks.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.260
What about fatphobia and thin oppression?

06:49.260 --> 06:53.140
I did a video laughing at the idea a little bit ago but let's seriously think it over.

06:53.140 --> 06:54.940
Can fat people be oppressed?

06:54.940 --> 06:56.860
Using intersectionalist logic, certainly.

06:56.860 --> 07:01.140
But is being fat an immutable characteristic like being black, gay or trans?

07:01.140 --> 07:02.560
Well, of course not.

07:02.560 --> 07:06.340
Some people have hormonal issues that make it so that their rate of gaining or losing

07:06.340 --> 07:07.400
weight is different.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.340
Some people are injured and therefore they can't work out as easily.

07:10.340 --> 07:13.260
Some people are legitimately traumatized and they use eating to cope.

07:13.260 --> 07:17.060
But all of these issues are ultimately secondary to calories in, calories out.

07:17.060 --> 07:21.340
If you put a fat person on a deserted island, I don't care what hormonal issues they have,

07:21.340 --> 07:23.320
they will lose weight as they starve.

07:23.320 --> 07:26.400
Hormonal issues do not override the laws of thermodynamics.

07:26.400 --> 07:30.780
The formula we've been using is that if a certain quality about a person is an immutable

07:30.780 --> 07:36.080
characteristic and it does not directly affect their behavior, then it is immoral to discriminate

07:36.080 --> 07:37.680
against them for that quality.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.960
Where does fatphobia come into this conversation?

07:39.960 --> 07:43.960
It's not immutable, though it can be hard to change, and there's certainly the possibility

07:43.960 --> 07:46.840
of direct changes in behavior due to being fat.

07:46.840 --> 07:49.160
So is it reasonable to discriminate against them?

07:49.160 --> 07:53.520
Well, what we've been talking about so far is the liberal conception of discrimination,

07:53.520 --> 07:57.200
centered on the individual, their rights, their choices, their behaviors.

07:57.200 --> 08:01.520
And this is also why all of the civil rights victories I've been describing have been fundamentally

08:01.520 --> 08:02.920
liberal in origin.

08:02.920 --> 08:05.300
They're all rooted in that individualist philosophy.

08:05.300 --> 08:09.600
It doesn't matter if I'm black or gay or trans, as long as I can get the job done, is the

08:09.600 --> 08:10.600
liberal view.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.340
It's what you do, not who you are.

08:12.340 --> 08:16.100
The socialist conception of discrimination is completely antithetical to this.

08:16.100 --> 08:21.200
It does not care about immutable characteristics or personal behaviors, though socialists may

08:21.200 --> 08:23.740
sometimes pay lip service to those ideas.

08:23.740 --> 08:27.240
The socialist conception of discrimination is rooted in the power differential between

08:27.240 --> 08:28.480
groups of people.

08:28.480 --> 08:33.060
It's all class conflict, it's all power politics, it's all proletariat and bourgeoisie.

08:33.060 --> 08:37.000
It's bad to be racist towards black people not because of immutable characteristics or

08:37.000 --> 08:41.960
lack of difference in behavior, but because white people have power and black people don't.

08:41.960 --> 08:44.960
That is a key difference between liberalism and socialism.

08:44.960 --> 08:48.840
A big problem with the socialist view is that this analysis can apply to anything.

08:48.840 --> 08:52.540
It's the powerful whites versus the oppressed blacks, the powerful straights versus the

08:52.540 --> 08:56.160
oppressed gays, the powerful thins versus the oppressed fats.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.880
All it takes for this analysis to work is for you to be able to identify a class of

08:59.880 --> 09:05.040
people as existing and then self-identify within that class, and now all of a sudden

09:05.040 --> 09:06.560
you are discriminated against.

09:06.560 --> 09:11.800
The act of identifying as a thing, not simply liking a thing, but pulling it into yourself

09:11.800 --> 09:17.260
and making it a part of your will, grants the person that paradoxical privilege of considering

09:17.260 --> 09:18.800
themselves oppressed.

09:18.800 --> 09:25.160
So for example, if you identify as non-binary and somebody critiques the idea of non-binary,

09:25.160 --> 09:27.140
that is an attack against you.

09:27.140 --> 09:31.160
You are being discriminated against, because this quality that is being discussed has become

09:31.160 --> 09:32.700
a component of your soul.

09:32.700 --> 09:37.960
So let's say you were to identify as a Ray Kylo shipper, as in, taken that stance on

09:37.960 --> 09:42.680
Star Wars into your identity and treated it the way that a liberal would treat an immutable

09:42.680 --> 09:43.680
characteristic.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.740
And yes, these tumblrite people do in fact do this.

09:46.740 --> 09:50.940
Even somebody who disagrees with that Ray Kylo ship, or who promotes a different ship,

09:50.940 --> 09:53.420
can be properly viewed as discriminating against you.

09:53.420 --> 09:58.400
I know this sounds completely wild and out there, but it's actually not far off from

09:58.400 --> 10:00.900
how religious people fit into intersectionality.

10:00.900 --> 10:05.560
The radical Muslim can, and often does, use this framework to claim that he's oppressed

10:05.560 --> 10:08.740
if you don't convert to his religion, and follow his rules.

10:08.740 --> 10:12.860
That's how he can claim bigotry if two gay men walk down the street holding hands while

10:12.860 --> 10:13.860
he's around.

10:13.860 --> 10:17.700
This logic is also used by people in the kink community, where not only do people come out

10:17.700 --> 10:23.100
as gay or trans now, but they also come out as being into a specific kink.

10:23.100 --> 10:26.660
And the most extreme among them will tell you that if you disapprove of their kink,

10:26.660 --> 10:31.740
you know, kink shaming, or even worse, don't share their kink, you're being oppressive

10:31.740 --> 10:32.740
towards them.

10:32.740 --> 10:36.520
You've also got people who have legitimate traumatic experiences, but have chosen to

10:36.520 --> 10:39.140
identify with them rather than work them out.

10:39.140 --> 10:43.420
And remember, that means pulling them into yourself, which in the case of trauma is quite

10:43.420 --> 10:44.420
unhealthy.

10:44.420 --> 10:48.560
How do you expect to improve your depression, your anxiety, your PTSD, if you make those

10:48.560 --> 10:51.140
things an integral part of your personality?

10:51.140 --> 10:53.320
And yes, pedophiles do this too.

10:53.320 --> 10:58.280
Why do you think they now identify as minor attracted persons, worded as if it is their

10:58.280 --> 11:01.620
own biology oppressing them and they're helpless to resist?

11:01.620 --> 11:06.180
All of these people are appealing to the liberal sensibility that if a thing is an immutable

11:06.180 --> 11:10.100
characteristic, then criticizing them for it is discrimination.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.260
But it's just socialist sleight of hand.

11:12.260 --> 11:14.660
Because underneath the surface, it's all power politics.

11:14.660 --> 11:19.260
Sargon did an excellent podcast on this topic over on his Lotus Eaters channel, but unfortunately

11:19.260 --> 11:21.820
it's a premium one, so you're just going to have to go and pay for it if you want to

11:21.820 --> 11:22.820
hear it.

11:22.820 --> 11:25.320
And I'm not going to republish it wholesale because it's not fair to him, but I do have

11:25.320 --> 11:27.460
to lean on it a little bit for this topic.

11:27.460 --> 11:32.420
Part of that podcast talks about the universalization of morality, meaning that for a moral system

11:32.420 --> 11:36.580
to be truly universal, it's not enough that you consider the other person's position.

11:36.580 --> 11:39.900
As in, I shouldn't steal because I wouldn't want the other person to steal from me.

11:39.900 --> 11:43.420
You must also consider the other person's position from his own ethical system to be

11:43.420 --> 11:44.500
truly universal.

11:44.500 --> 11:49.960
As in, his moral position must have just as much weight in your eyes as your moral position.

11:49.960 --> 11:53.500
You must be able to say that while you don't agree with the radical Muslim who wants to

11:53.500 --> 11:58.000
kill gay people, you understand that he is Muslim and from his position, killing gay

11:58.000 --> 12:01.740
people is a moral good and that that position is just as valid as yours.

12:01.740 --> 12:04.340
That is what the universalization of morality demands.

12:04.340 --> 12:08.500
In other words, if you must craft a moral system that covers both you and this radical

12:08.500 --> 12:13.340
Muslim, what moral injunctions would that system include that covers both of you while

12:13.340 --> 12:16.460
simultaneously violating neither of your moral codes?

12:16.460 --> 12:19.020
It turns out almost none because you have almost nothing in common.

12:19.020 --> 12:23.540
And if you must have a moral framework that covers all seven point whatever billion human

12:23.540 --> 12:27.860
beings, you will discover that that universal moral framework has nothing to say at all.

12:27.860 --> 12:32.180
This is why leftists always end up fetishizing the barbaric practices of other cultures while

12:32.180 --> 12:36.000
simultaneously claiming that the West has no culture of its own because what they view

12:36.000 --> 12:39.680
as true Western culture is this universalizing process.

12:39.680 --> 12:43.480
They have no objection to the Muslim because to him, instituting Sharia law is a moral

12:43.480 --> 12:44.480
good.

12:44.480 --> 12:47.680
They have no objection to the pedophile because from his position, he is good to do what he

12:47.680 --> 12:48.680
does.

12:48.680 --> 12:52.400
And when something inevitably goes wrong, when this system inevitably fails, they must

12:52.400 --> 12:56.760
blame everything but the individual, society, culture, white supremacy, the police, their

12:56.760 --> 13:00.840
parents, whatever, because to hold the individual accountable for their actions is to imply

13:00.840 --> 13:05.160
that the liberal position, that the values of our culture actually hold some weight.

13:05.160 --> 13:09.640
This is why almost every single martyr that Black Lives Matter holds up seems to have

13:09.640 --> 13:10.820
a spotty past.

13:10.820 --> 13:15.520
Or why Kyle Rittenhouse can shoot three leftist agitators attacking him and randomly manage

13:15.520 --> 13:18.580
to hit a rapist, a pedophile, and a wife beater.

13:18.580 --> 13:23.080
Or why whenever we see the mugshots and records of various anti-fariators, they always end

13:23.080 --> 13:24.360
up being thugs.

13:24.360 --> 13:27.380
This is also why cancel culture is fundamentally a leftist idea.

13:27.380 --> 13:32.520
To say one thing wrong, one bad tweet, one misspoken sentence, one drop of wrongthink

13:32.520 --> 13:36.780
is to cast doubt not only on that specific instance of the moment, but to oppose the

13:36.780 --> 13:40.940
entire moral framework that they've built up, where we are all obligated to grant an

13:40.940 --> 13:43.320
equal moral weighting to everybody's point of view.

13:43.320 --> 13:47.240
And of course, if the Christians are wrong and there is no true objective morality as

13:47.240 --> 13:51.800
enforced by God, then it only makes sense that this would be the final end of socialist

13:51.800 --> 13:52.800
thought.

13:52.800 --> 13:53.800
Everybody's equal.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.980
Everybody's moral position intrinsically holds no value over anybody else's.

13:56.980 --> 13:59.160
Nobody has the authority to judge anybody else.

13:59.160 --> 14:03.840
And so, the morals of such a society must necessarily be no morals at all.

14:03.840 --> 14:08.160
Such a society has no reason to ban political violence and in fact may deify it.

14:08.160 --> 14:11.320
Such a society even has no reason to ban sex with children.

14:11.320 --> 14:15.100
The consequentialists among the left will complain on the basis of bad outcomes, but

14:15.100 --> 14:20.280
even they have no method to determine that what they consider to be a bad outcome isn't

14:20.280 --> 14:22.720
considered a good outcome to the person committing that act.

14:22.720 --> 14:27.020
And since that person's position must hold just as much moral weight as them, they will

14:27.020 --> 14:28.560
simply be swept aside.

14:28.560 --> 14:33.640
And certainly, such a society would allow you to identify with your own cultural consumption

14:33.640 --> 14:35.480
and make it an intrinsic part of you.

14:35.480 --> 14:38.800
Being a man-child sitting around a bunch of Star Wars figurines talking about the latest

14:38.800 --> 14:43.680
Marvel movie is not simply a hobby, it's your personality, it's your identity, to

14:43.680 --> 14:48.040
the point that violating it in any way is akin to being a racist or a sexist.

14:48.040 --> 14:51.040
And there is no leftist argument against this.

14:51.040 --> 14:55.300
Not within socialism, not within social justice, not within intersectionality.

14:55.300 --> 15:00.380
The end result of their ideas is that everyone has an equal moral weight to everyone else.

15:00.380 --> 15:05.020
And if the Marvel nerd wants to say that that's where his moral weighting lies to him, who

15:05.020 --> 15:06.260
are you to complain?

15:06.260 --> 15:10.260
This is how you get those terminally online smooth brains who will say that criticism

15:10.260 --> 15:14.700
is bullying because their consumption is their identity, and therefore it's a moral good

15:14.700 --> 15:18.620
that they cheer for Disney as a corporation and that your opposition to Disney is just

15:18.620 --> 15:19.840
bigotry towards them.

15:19.840 --> 15:24.780
As weird as it may seem for somebody who only has a surface knowledge of socialism's ethics,

15:24.780 --> 15:29.100
yes, there's actually multiple links between socialism and corporatism.

15:29.100 --> 15:33.540
And yes, as I've just shown, demanding that your identity be considered sacred is one

15:33.540 --> 15:34.620
of those links.

15:34.620 --> 15:38.900
The only real counter to this whole thing, as far as I can see, is to actually have some

15:38.900 --> 15:41.820
standards and stick by them, even when times get tough.

15:41.820 --> 15:45.420
To be brave enough to tell somebody when they're doing something wrong that they are in fact

15:45.420 --> 15:46.480
doing something wrong.

15:46.480 --> 15:50.160
We can discuss where the source of that sense of right and wrong comes from in a future

15:50.160 --> 15:52.760
video, because I don't think it lies in religion.

15:52.760 --> 15:54.740
But for now, I'll just leave you with this.

15:54.740 --> 15:56.320
It's generally good to be polite.

15:56.320 --> 16:00.780
If somebody asks you to respect some aspect of themselves and it costs you nothing, and

16:00.780 --> 16:04.660
you want to maintain that connection with them, then there's no real harm in doing it.

16:04.660 --> 16:09.140
But if someone demands it from you, or if their request makes no outward sense, or if

16:09.140 --> 16:14.060
they get irrationally angry when you refuse or question them, then you know it is a power

16:14.060 --> 16:15.060
play.

16:15.060 --> 16:16.640
And now you know why they're doing it.

16:16.640 --> 16:20.380
You know what the power is, you know where it leads, and you know that you should absolutely

16:20.380 --> 16:21.380
deny them.

16:21.380 --> 16:25.220
It's not just words, it's not just being respectful or being polite or making people

16:25.220 --> 16:26.220
feel safe.

16:26.220 --> 16:30.460
It is an active attempt by them to erode your own morality.

16:30.460 --> 16:34.560
And if you value your character, you shouldn't let them do it.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.300
