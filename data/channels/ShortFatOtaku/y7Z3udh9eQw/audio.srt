1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,520
A year ago, I did a video called The Identification with Evil, which on its surface was about

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,060
the new guy meme, while the actual meat of the video was about how the constant drive

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,000
towards equality that comes out of the left causes people to not only excuse evil, but

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,240
to become evil themselves, to advocate for and commit evil acts, because good and evil

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,700
are ideas that, when you boil it down, change depending on who's viewing the scene.

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,740
And there's no reason for them to privilege any one person's view over anybody else's.

7
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,860
Meaning, when your average person reads the original new guy comic, it seems like the

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,580
new guy is the good person in the situation, and the purple haired SJW midget is the evil

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,580
person.

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,760
When the new guy says, how would you like it if somebody stole from you, he's appealing

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,140
to a specific moral framework.

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,260
A society that values property rights will consider stealing immoral, no matter who's

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,140
doing the stealing and who the victim is, because you wouldn't want to be stolen from,

14
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,980
therefore you should not steal from other people.

15
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,700
Meanwhile the purple haired thinks it's okay to steal from Pewdiepie, yes the comic's reference

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,100
to when Pewdiepie's house got broken into, because he's rich, he's white, he's a gamer,

17
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,100
etc etc.

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,360
She has a moral system where these intrinsic qualities of the victim means that it's good

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,420
to steal from them.

20
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,220
The author of the comic herself is a social justice warrior, and she intended for the

21
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,420
new guy to come off as entirely unreasonable, the fact that the public's overwhelming reaction

22
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,900
to it was to side with the new guy, to the point that he became a meme, is a testament

23
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,760
to just how dislodged from reality the author actually was.

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,460
But what makes her wrong?

25
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,060
Why shouldn't we accept her position to be just as equal as his?

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,780
And no I'm not just bringing up an old meme for the fun of it.

27
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,460
If you spent any time on tumblr before the great migration from tumblr to twitter, you'll

28
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,960
notice that fandom communities are the most toxic things around.

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,820
If you like the wrong shows or movies, you're problematic and a bigot, if you play a video

30
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,780
game the wrong way, you're problematic and a bigot, ship the wrong characters together,

31
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,400
that is, believe that person X and person Y in the show or whatever would make a good

32
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,220
romantic couple, and you're problematic and a bigot.

33
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,160
Yesterday this thread went v- I knew you would lock your account, I was right to archive

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
this thread.

35
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,260
This thread went viral, and it's long and cancerous, but it's worth talking about.

36
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,780
This card does such a good job explaining why pro-shipping is bad holy shit, I am now

37
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,400
going to have to fill your brain with some absolutely useless information, I apologize

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
in advance.

39
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,880
Pro-shipping is when a person respects other people's fictional romantic pairings regardless

40
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,500
of their own personal feelings toward that pairing.

41
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,220
So for example, let's say you don't like the idea of Rey and Kylo Ren as a romantic pairing

42
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,760
in the Star Wars sequels.

43
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,720
Let's say personally you'd prefer that Rey get together with Finn.

44
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,240
Now let's say your friend prefers Rey and Kylo together.

45
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,160
If you're a pro-shipper, you are declaring that you will not harass your friend over

46
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,840
your difference of opinion regarding who Rey should get with.

47
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,380
This person is saying that pro-shipping, that lack of harassment over differences of opinion

48
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,320
regarding fictional romantic pairings, is a bad thing.

49
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,680
So this card does such a good job explaining why pro-shipping is bad, let's see their position.

50
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,120
I'm going to paraphrase it, because to be honest, my life is short enough already without

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,260
spending even more time reading all of this out to you.

52
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,640
Representation doesn't affect reality.

53
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,360
If that were true, representation wouldn't matter.

54
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,440
And if we accept representation in media matters, then representing, say, adults with children

55
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,520
like with loli art, normalizes pedophilic abuse and grants pedos platforms.

56
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,540
Therefore art actively harms victims and validates abusers.

57
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,180
People can ship who they want.

58
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,680
Why do you want to ship ancestor pedophilia?

59
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,660
Even if it's fictional, your ship of them says you justify those actions.

60
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:46,460
Letting people ship who they want justifies racist and LGBT-phobic caricatures.

61
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,820
And this is like people using memes to recruit kids to the alt-right.

62
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,640
I'm coping with my own trauma.

63
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,460
Then you should be sensitive of how your ship traumatizes others.

64
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,640
You're censoring us.

65
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,060
You dogpile creators and threaten them offline for making nessa and pokemon the wrong shade

66
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,060
of brown.

67
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,700
If you use your artistic expression to say bad things, it is only natural to deplatform

68
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,700
you.

69
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,900
Considering our righteous anger as abusive is an alt-right dogwhistle.

70
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,260
Because racists who commonly present their racism always claim the moral high ground

71
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,020
over bipoc people who are angry at their racism.

72
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,020
It's not my responsibility.

73
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,220
You expect traumatized people to jump through hoops to avoid being retraumatized?

74
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,180
No the onus is on you to self-censor.

75
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,140
I'm only ironically racist for the memes leads to it's only fictional pedophilia

76
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,940
and incest and rape leads to it's only online white supremacy.

77
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,340
Therefore we should stop it all at the source.

78
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,300
Maybe you noticed while I was going through all that but on some level both sides of this

79
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,660
argument are cancerous and the correct response to the whole thing is fuck off.

80
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,180
It's certainly weird when an artist draws loli and I don't approve personally but

81
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,300
I would never censor somebody who does it.

82
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,700
How did we get to this point though?

83
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,020
Where the types of art you consume or create are not only a barometer of whether or not

84
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,540
you're secretly a bigot but actually it's own vector of oppression like race or gender

85
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,540
or class.

86
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,300
Let's go back to the source, what is the philosophical underpinning for legal equality

87
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,140
between people of different races?

88
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,300
Well in the western liberal sense it's that being of another race, let's talk from

89
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,580
an American perspective and use black, it's that being black is an immutable characteristic

90
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,680
and doesn't directly affect the behavior of the individual.

91
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,280
So it would be immoral to treat white and black people differently as neither of them

92
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,980
can help what race they are and it doesn't actually matter in the end as long as they're

93
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,520
behavior is the same.

94
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,880
This same logic was used in my opinion correctly to advocate for gay marriage, again being

95
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,580
gay is an immutable characteristic and doesn't directly affect the behavior of the individual.

96
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,100
Now you can make a slight argument here that there is a difference in behavior because

97
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,460
gay sex and straight sex are not the same thing but when it comes to the institution

98
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,520
of marriage, people devoting themselves to each other exclusively, becoming a stable

99
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,300
unit for the purposes of companionship lasting beyond just sexual pleasure where there's

100
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,860
love and long-term decision-making and pooling of resources and all the other things that

101
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,060
make it an ideal environment to raise children, there is no reason for gay people not to have

102
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,620
access to this institution.

103
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,700
In other words, if gay people can enter into a monogamous relationship, devote themselves

104
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,180
to each other and do all of those stabilizing behaviors that create a healthy household,

105
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,740
there is no reason they shouldn't be allowed to raise children even if there's real differences

106
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,320
between them and straight people.

107
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,140
Same with trans people, if the stability is there, there's no reason a cis man and a

108
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,300
cis woman can't get married and raise kids in a mainly traditional manner despite the

109
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,180
obvious non-traditionalness of their relationship because an individual's positive habits

110
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,100
are more important than their immutable characteristics.

111
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,840
Everything sounds good so far, at least to me, but as you continue through the progressive

112
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,200
stack we start to hit roadblocks.

113
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,260
What about fatphobia and thin oppression?

114
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,140
I did a video laughing at the idea a little bit ago but let's seriously think it over.

115
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,940
Can fat people be oppressed?

116
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,860
Using intersectionalist logic, certainly.

117
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,140
But is being fat an immutable characteristic like being black, gay or trans?

118
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,560
Well, of course not.

119
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,340
Some people have hormonal issues that make it so that their rate of gaining or losing

120
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,400
weight is different.

121
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,340
Some people are injured and therefore they can't work out as easily.

122
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,260
Some people are legitimately traumatized and they use eating to cope.

123
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,060
But all of these issues are ultimately secondary to calories in, calories out.

124
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,340
If you put a fat person on a deserted island, I don't care what hormonal issues they have,

125
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,320
they will lose weight as they starve.

126
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,400
Hormonal issues do not override the laws of thermodynamics.

127
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,780
The formula we've been using is that if a certain quality about a person is an immutable

128
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:36,080
characteristic and it does not directly affect their behavior, then it is immoral to discriminate

129
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,680
against them for that quality.

130
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,960
Where does fatphobia come into this conversation?

131
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,960
It's not immutable, though it can be hard to change, and there's certainly the possibility

132
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,840
of direct changes in behavior due to being fat.

133
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,160
So is it reasonable to discriminate against them?

134
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,520
Well, what we've been talking about so far is the liberal conception of discrimination,

135
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,200
centered on the individual, their rights, their choices, their behaviors.

136
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,520
And this is also why all of the civil rights victories I've been describing have been fundamentally

137
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,920
liberal in origin.

138
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,300
They're all rooted in that individualist philosophy.

139
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,600
It doesn't matter if I'm black or gay or trans, as long as I can get the job done, is the

140
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
liberal view.

141
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,340
It's what you do, not who you are.

142
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,100
The socialist conception of discrimination is completely antithetical to this.

143
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:21,200
It does not care about immutable characteristics or personal behaviors, though socialists may

144
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,740
sometimes pay lip service to those ideas.

145
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,240
The socialist conception of discrimination is rooted in the power differential between

146
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,480
groups of people.

147
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,060
It's all class conflict, it's all power politics, it's all proletariat and bourgeoisie.

148
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,000
It's bad to be racist towards black people not because of immutable characteristics or

149
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,960
lack of difference in behavior, but because white people have power and black people don't.

150
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,960
That is a key difference between liberalism and socialism.

151
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,840
A big problem with the socialist view is that this analysis can apply to anything.

152
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,540
It's the powerful whites versus the oppressed blacks, the powerful straights versus the

153
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,160
oppressed gays, the powerful thins versus the oppressed fats.

154
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,880
All it takes for this analysis to work is for you to be able to identify a class of

155
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,040
people as existing and then self-identify within that class, and now all of a sudden

156
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,560
you are discriminated against.

157
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,800
The act of identifying as a thing, not simply liking a thing, but pulling it into yourself

158
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,260
and making it a part of your will, grants the person that paradoxical privilege of considering

159
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,800
themselves oppressed.

160
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,160
So for example, if you identify as non-binary and somebody critiques the idea of non-binary,

161
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,140
that is an attack against you.

162
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,160
You are being discriminated against, because this quality that is being discussed has become

163
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,700
a component of your soul.

164
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,960
So let's say you were to identify as a Ray Kylo shipper, as in, taken that stance on

165
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,680
Star Wars into your identity and treated it the way that a liberal would treat an immutable

166
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
characteristic.

167
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,740
And yes, these tumblrite people do in fact do this.

168
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,940
Even somebody who disagrees with that Ray Kylo ship, or who promotes a different ship,

169
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,420
can be properly viewed as discriminating against you.

170
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,400
I know this sounds completely wild and out there, but it's actually not far off from

171
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,900
how religious people fit into intersectionality.

172
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,560
The radical Muslim can, and often does, use this framework to claim that he's oppressed

173
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,740
if you don't convert to his religion, and follow his rules.

174
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,860
That's how he can claim bigotry if two gay men walk down the street holding hands while

175
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,860
he's around.

176
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,700
This logic is also used by people in the kink community, where not only do people come out

177
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:23,100
as gay or trans now, but they also come out as being into a specific kink.

178
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,660
And the most extreme among them will tell you that if you disapprove of their kink,

179
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,740
you know, kink shaming, or even worse, don't share their kink, you're being oppressive

180
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,740
towards them.

181
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,520
You've also got people who have legitimate traumatic experiences, but have chosen to

182
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,140
identify with them rather than work them out.

183
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,420
And remember, that means pulling them into yourself, which in the case of trauma is quite

184
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,420
unhealthy.

185
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,560
How do you expect to improve your depression, your anxiety, your PTSD, if you make those

186
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,140
things an integral part of your personality?

187
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,320
And yes, pedophiles do this too.

188
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,280
Why do you think they now identify as minor attracted persons, worded as if it is their

189
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,620
own biology oppressing them and they're helpless to resist?

190
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,180
All of these people are appealing to the liberal sensibility that if a thing is an immutable

191
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,100
characteristic, then criticizing them for it is discrimination.

192
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,260
But it's just socialist sleight of hand.

193
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,660
Because underneath the surface, it's all power politics.

194
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,260
Sargon did an excellent podcast on this topic over on his Lotus Eaters channel, but unfortunately

195
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,820
it's a premium one, so you're just going to have to go and pay for it if you want to

196
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,820
hear it.

197
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,320
And I'm not going to republish it wholesale because it's not fair to him, but I do have

198
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,460
to lean on it a little bit for this topic.

199
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:32,420
Part of that podcast talks about the universalization of morality, meaning that for a moral system

200
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,580
to be truly universal, it's not enough that you consider the other person's position.

201
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,900
As in, I shouldn't steal because I wouldn't want the other person to steal from me.

202
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,420
You must also consider the other person's position from his own ethical system to be

203
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,500
truly universal.

204
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:49,960
As in, his moral position must have just as much weight in your eyes as your moral position.

205
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,500
You must be able to say that while you don't agree with the radical Muslim who wants to

206
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,000
kill gay people, you understand that he is Muslim and from his position, killing gay

207
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,740
people is a moral good and that that position is just as valid as yours.

208
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,340
That is what the universalization of morality demands.

209
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:08,500
In other words, if you must craft a moral system that covers both you and this radical

210
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,340
Muslim, what moral injunctions would that system include that covers both of you while

211
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,460
simultaneously violating neither of your moral codes?

212
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,020
It turns out almost none because you have almost nothing in common.

213
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,540
And if you must have a moral framework that covers all seven point whatever billion human

214
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,860
beings, you will discover that that universal moral framework has nothing to say at all.

215
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,180
This is why leftists always end up fetishizing the barbaric practices of other cultures while

216
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,000
simultaneously claiming that the West has no culture of its own because what they view

217
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,680
as true Western culture is this universalizing process.

218
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,480
They have no objection to the Muslim because to him, instituting Sharia law is a moral

219
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
good.

220
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,680
They have no objection to the pedophile because from his position, he is good to do what he

221
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,680
does.

222
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,400
And when something inevitably goes wrong, when this system inevitably fails, they must

223
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,760
blame everything but the individual, society, culture, white supremacy, the police, their

224
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,840
parents, whatever, because to hold the individual accountable for their actions is to imply

225
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,160
that the liberal position, that the values of our culture actually hold some weight.

226
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,640
This is why almost every single martyr that Black Lives Matter holds up seems to have

227
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,820
a spotty past.

228
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,520
Or why Kyle Rittenhouse can shoot three leftist agitators attacking him and randomly manage

229
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,580
to hit a rapist, a pedophile, and a wife beater.

230
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,080
Or why whenever we see the mugshots and records of various anti-fariators, they always end

231
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,360
up being thugs.

232
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,380
This is also why cancel culture is fundamentally a leftist idea.

233
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:32,520
To say one thing wrong, one bad tweet, one misspoken sentence, one drop of wrongthink

234
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,780
is to cast doubt not only on that specific instance of the moment, but to oppose the

235
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,940
entire moral framework that they've built up, where we are all obligated to grant an

236
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,320
equal moral weighting to everybody's point of view.

237
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,240
And of course, if the Christians are wrong and there is no true objective morality as

238
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,800
enforced by God, then it only makes sense that this would be the final end of socialist

239
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
thought.

240
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Everybody's equal.

241
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,980
Everybody's moral position intrinsically holds no value over anybody else's.

242
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,160
Nobody has the authority to judge anybody else.

243
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,840
And so, the morals of such a society must necessarily be no morals at all.

244
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,160
Such a society has no reason to ban political violence and in fact may deify it.

245
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,320
Such a society even has no reason to ban sex with children.

246
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,100
The consequentialists among the left will complain on the basis of bad outcomes, but

247
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,280
even they have no method to determine that what they consider to be a bad outcome isn't

248
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,720
considered a good outcome to the person committing that act.

249
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,020
And since that person's position must hold just as much moral weight as them, they will

250
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,560
simply be swept aside.

251
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,640
And certainly, such a society would allow you to identify with your own cultural consumption

252
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,480
and make it an intrinsic part of you.

253
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,800
Being a man-child sitting around a bunch of Star Wars figurines talking about the latest

254
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,680
Marvel movie is not simply a hobby, it's your personality, it's your identity, to

255
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,040
the point that violating it in any way is akin to being a racist or a sexist.

256
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,040
And there is no leftist argument against this.

257
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,300
Not within socialism, not within social justice, not within intersectionality.

258
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,380
The end result of their ideas is that everyone has an equal moral weight to everyone else.

259
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:05,020
And if the Marvel nerd wants to say that that's where his moral weighting lies to him, who

260
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,260
are you to complain?

261
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,260
This is how you get those terminally online smooth brains who will say that criticism

262
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,700
is bullying because their consumption is their identity, and therefore it's a moral good

263
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,620
that they cheer for Disney as a corporation and that your opposition to Disney is just

264
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,840
bigotry towards them.

265
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,780
As weird as it may seem for somebody who only has a surface knowledge of socialism's ethics,

266
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,100
yes, there's actually multiple links between socialism and corporatism.

267
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,540
And yes, as I've just shown, demanding that your identity be considered sacred is one

268
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,620
of those links.

269
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,900
The only real counter to this whole thing, as far as I can see, is to actually have some

270
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,820
standards and stick by them, even when times get tough.

271
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,420
To be brave enough to tell somebody when they're doing something wrong that they are in fact

272
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,480
doing something wrong.

273
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,160
We can discuss where the source of that sense of right and wrong comes from in a future

274
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,760
video, because I don't think it lies in religion.

275
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,740
But for now, I'll just leave you with this.

276
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,320
It's generally good to be polite.

277
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,780
If somebody asks you to respect some aspect of themselves and it costs you nothing, and

278
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,660
you want to maintain that connection with them, then there's no real harm in doing it.

279
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:09,140
But if someone demands it from you, or if their request makes no outward sense, or if

280
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:14,060
they get irrationally angry when you refuse or question them, then you know it is a power

281
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,060
play.

282
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,640
And now you know why they're doing it.

283
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,380
You know what the power is, you know where it leads, and you know that you should absolutely

284
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,380
deny them.

285
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,220
It's not just words, it's not just being respectful or being polite or making people

286
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,220
feel safe.

287
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,460
It is an active attempt by them to erode your own morality.

288
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,560
And if you value your character, you shouldn't let them do it.

289
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,300
