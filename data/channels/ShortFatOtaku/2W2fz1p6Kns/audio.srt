1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040
YouTube wants to remove the downvote button on videos, again.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,080
This last came up back in 2019, and I made a video on it then.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,160
I actually recommend you go back and watch that one, because today I'm going to be building

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,120
on some of the ideas from back then.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,540
But as always, because I love you a lot, I'll give you the TLDR real quick.

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,920
In that video I used two then-contemporary examples.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,020
Firstly, the episode of The Orville, where the alien planet they encounter has a government

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,300
run by social media votes, and secondly, the Egoraptor controversy, where he had built

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,300
a career out of edgy humor, and now that he's comfortably established, wants that humor

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,640
and anything else that may make people uncomfortable be banned from the internet.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,420
Both examples, as well as other smaller ones I briefly mentioned, focused on people who

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,500
spend too much time on social media, to the point that dislikes and downvotes cripple

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,500
their ability to behave normally, and as such, they begin to advocate for the removal of

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,400
all negative feedback online, in the hopes that they will never have to experience a

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,100
negative emotion ever again.

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,500
And if that other people's rights had to be trampled, that was a sacrifice they were

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,500
willing to pay.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,980
I referred to this point of view as having had a moral lobotomy, and it's a label that

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,160
I still think fits.

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,820
The always-on nature of social media, the everything-is-political, nothing-is-private

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,980
progressive orientation of the online world nowadays, has created a cast of people who

22
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,780
are constantly emoting for the sake of an audience.

23
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,260
Everything they do is calculated and performed, with no humanity behind it.

24
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,020
And those people who don't perform, who don't turn themselves into an object of theater

25
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,940
during every public moment of their lives, are considered outcasts, even if they're just

26
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,280
behaving neutrally.

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,360
The specific launch point for this video is YouTube's newest announcement that the dislike

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,060
button is going away, something that they toyed with in 2019 but never actually did.

29
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,320
Here's the video where they announced it.

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,320
As expected, it's got 80,000 dislikes.

31
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,560
In that episode of The Orville, there was a guy who had so many dislikes that he was

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,540
deemed socially undesirable, and had his brain altered so that he was the perfectly sanitized,

33
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,920
always-emoting social media candidate.

34
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,280
Let's compare his mannerisms and vocabulary to this guy.

35
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,820
Jesus, it was a social commentary on YouTube, you're not actually supposed to turn people

36
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,820
into this.

37
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,080
Okay, fun aside, let's actually go through this video.

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,800
Apparently groups of viewers are targeting a video's dislike button to drive up the count,

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,680
turning it into something like a game with a visible scoreboard.

40
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,840
And it's usually just because they don't like the creator or what they stand for.

41
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,160
That's a big problem when half of YouTube's mission is to give everyone a voice.

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,840
But downvotes don't deny people that voice, do they?

43
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,120
Having a lot of downvotes doesn't mean the video is yeeted off the platform, it's still

44
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
engagement.

45
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,160
But more importantly, yes, you're describing a feature, not a flaw.

46
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,560
When he says that the votes are used as a scoreboard in a game, that's correct, and

47
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,680
that's how it should be.

48
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,600
YouTube is ultimately still a place that people use for entertainment, YouTube's official

49
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,880
party line be damned.

50
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,440
And some of the best moments come out of when YouTubers themselves recognize the game, and

51
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,320
ask for their fans to test the limits of YouTube's features.

52
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,760
I literally just want to try something.

53
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,800
If everybody, okay, everybody who's watching this, no I'm serious, I'm fucking serious,

54
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,240
if you have a YouTube account and you're watching this, comment something, anything.

55
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,520
I just want to see, um, like, how comments work on like the rankings.

56
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,120
I legitimately just like want to see, like, what if we get like 90 fucking thousand comments?

57
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,080
Like everybody, just for fun, I'm doing this seriously just as a test.

58
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,320
To see if it like, if it makes us appear on like the front page.

59
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,520
Or like, and like, just to see if YouTube is like, checks us like, what the fuck's going

60
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
on here?

61
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,900
Like, let's see how many comments we can get on YouTube.

62
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:56,160
The update from YouTube is that the dislike button is staying, but the dislike counts

63
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,820
will now be private.

64
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,960
You can still dislike videos and that action will be used to tune your own recommendations,

65
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,240
but you won't be able to see the dislike count.

66
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,480
Only the creator can find it on the back end if they want.

67
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,760
This is contrary to what they said before, where the dislike button would be going away

68
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
entirely.

69
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,100
But if it's still there, then what's the point?

70
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,320
They claim us to protect the mental health of creators who get too many downvotes.

71
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,360
But creators can still see these downvotes, it's only the public who can't.

72
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,600
Do you know who this actually protects?

73
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,100
It protects the White House, whose videos have been constantly downvoted into oblivion

74
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,640
ever since Biden took office.

75
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,000
It protects legacy media, who are overwhelmingly rejected in favor of alt-tech nowadays.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,320
It protects Disney and Activision Blizzard and every other shitty corporation that keeps

77
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,940
pumping out garbage from being ridiculed for it.

78
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,960
It protects blue checkmarks, who generally want likes, dislikes, comments, all of it

79
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,880
disabled, on every site everywhere, so they don't have to hear from common people whenever

80
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,880
they say something dumb.

81
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,640
And it certainly protects those thin-skinned, older YouTubers I mentioned in the last video,

82
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,020
who might have been edgy a decade ago, but now they're constantly disabling comments

83
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,020
and banning people.

84
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,180
It's not just YouTube though, every social media site is trending this way.

85
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,820
The only emotion allowed on the internet nowadays is a shallow, vague sense of fake happiness.

86
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,200
How many times have you seen this below a Twitter thread?

87
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,400
Show offensive content, show offensive content, show offensive content.

88
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,560
Never mind that none of the content is actually offensive.

89
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,480
Hell, my Twitter page is marked as dangerous.

90
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,240
It has been for a while, and you want to know why?

91
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,500
It's because I've been rejecting Twitter's requests to verify my phone number.

92
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
That's it.

93
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
Fuck you, Twitter.

94
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
But Twitter does shit like this regularly.

95
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,940
They disable retweets and likes on stuff they say promotes violence, or goes contrary to

96
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,060
the views of their fact-checkers, even if that's obvious bullshit.

97
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,960
Kyle Rittenhouse's Mom's Defense Fund is suppressed by Twitter, despite him clearly

98
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,900
being innocent and acting in self-defense.

99
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,740
The fundraiser sites used for these types of things routinely deplatform people for

100
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,120
no reason other than not liking their political slant.

101
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,080
Facebook nukes whole-ass pages for the flimsiest of reasons.

102
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,040
Hell, as the centralization of internet services has continued, Fandom, the service that provides

103
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,920
for fan-wickies, has decided that no sexual content is allowed on any of their wiki services,

104
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,820
even if the specific show or movie series or game series has sex in it.

105
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,800
This is all part of the always emoting, always on mentality I mentioned before.

106
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,720
The elites need to not only have power, but to also look like they are loving and adored

107
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
by the plebs.

108
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,600
And the plebs need to smile and say they like it every time they get raped.

109
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,240
You're being told to love your chains, or at the very least, perform publicly like

110
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,440
you do so that other people develop a sense of crippling self-doubt for wondering if something

111
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
might be wrong.

112
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,040
And God forbid you emote in the other direction if you perform in such a way that sheds light

113
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,360
or makes fun of this mentality.

114
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,440
God forbid you use memes to make fun of those in power rather than reinforce the existing

115
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
structures.

116
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,840
Recently House Rep Paul Gosar got in trouble for posting a remake of the opening of Attack

117
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,800
on Titan, with illegal immigrants replacing the Titans, border patrol replacing the Survey

118
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,540
Corps, Republicans replacing the main heroes, and it's a bit hard to see, but yes that

119
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,640
is an AOC Titan being killed.

120
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,320
It ends with Gosar himself confronting a giant oblivious Joe Biden in the place of the colossal

121
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Titan.

122
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,520
Now this is fucking hilarious, this is shitpostygoodness.

123
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,360
But it's memeing in the other direction.

124
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,920
It's emoting in the other direction.

125
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,780
It's using the equalizing nature of social media, where anyone can post anything and

126
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,320
anybody can see it, to make fun of the powers that be rather than reinforce them.

127
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,780
So of course the entire internet lost its fucking mind.

128
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,780
Just like they did with Pepe.

129
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,300
Just like they did with the okay hand symbol.

130
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,620
Just like they did with anything that they didn't understand, but seemed to be at their

131
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,620
expense.

132
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,240
The journos and the corpos pearl clutched and said how dare you.

133
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,900
Even Nancy Pelosi said this was a legitimate threat of violence and called on the ethics

134
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,500
committee to investigate the creation of this horrific meme.

135
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,660
And when Gosar replied with a Wojak vs Chad meme, the progressives lost their mind again.

136
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,740
I've mentioned a few times on this channel that tyrants can tolerate people who offer

137
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,660
serious critiques of their regimes, as long as they don't get too uppity.

138
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,380
It's better for somebody to speak and feel as if they've been heard, because then he's

139
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,380
less of a threat.

140
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,260
But tyrants can never tolerate humor, because at least if he's critiqued, he's taken seriously.

141
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,540
If he's laughed at, things only a joke, a farce, not worthy of respect or fear.

142
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,020
A tyrant's only response to being laughed at is violence, that's why they always go

143
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,220
for comedians first.

144
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,220
But that idea, that view on comedy in relation to the tyrant, is another piece of this social

145
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,340
media puzzle.

146
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,060
Social media is that great equalizer, where everybody can see what you post, high status

147
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,060
or low.

148
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,820
But those with high status don't like being told that the rest of us don't like what they

149
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,820
do.

150
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,060
They find it offensive, because I guess if you live your life with privilege and then

151
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,220
suddenly have to experience what it's like to be critiqued by those you look down on,

152
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,600
you probably would feel offended.

153
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,380
So slowly but surely, social media sites will continue to strip away tools that those with

154
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,140
low status use to speak.

155
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,340
Because those high status people in charge of things have realized, more often than not,

156
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,060
those tools are used to speak dissent.

157
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,880
In the late 90s and early 2000s, having a form or a comment section on your website

158
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
meant you'd have made it.

159
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,620
You could be a legitimate place for conversation now.

160
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,060
Hell, even a guest book where people could leave comment to serve the same function.

161
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,340
But now, comment sections on news articles are all but gone, because journals don't like

162
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,540
being contradicted.

163
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,660
Rating features are becoming more simplified or removed outright, or in the case of something

164
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,340
like Rotten Tomatoes, repeatedly rigged to present a false air of popularity.

165
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,580
YouTubers disabling comments on their videos is no longer considered a sign of weakness,

166
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,980
as it should be, but instead shows them to be a victim of hate, hate from their own audience.

167
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,820
Content warnings everywhere, fact-checking labels added to posts in real time, the inability

168
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,100
to share content deemed problematic, it's all part of the same thing.

169
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,620
Corpos, journos, politicians, and pearl-clutching progressives have all realized that nobody

170
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,880
fucking likes them.

171
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,200
Nobody wants to adhere to their rules, nobody subscribes to their vision of the future,

172
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,760
and their solution is to restrict speech online to the point that your regular person has

173
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,160
no choice but to either leave a smiling emoji or say nothing at all.

174
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,320
And in fact, depending on where you live, dissenting online might actually be illegal.

175
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,080
Old tech like Newgrounds and 4chan, along with alt-tech like Bitchute and Odyssey, remain

176
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
outliers.

177
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,280
They're more committed to free speech than mainline tech, which makes them more fun places

178
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
to hang out.

179
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,280
It also explains why they're constantly slandered as alt-right, fascist, nazi, racist, sexist,

180
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,200
transphobic, Islamophobic, you name it, they are it.

181
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,760
But that's the counterculture nowadays, these outside spaces, these new wild wests,

182
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
where the rules are few.

183
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,140
It's not these sanitized platforms that only serve to inject dopamine into the base

184
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,120
of your skull until you realize you've wasted the last decade of your life doomscrolling.

185
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,500
If your hypersensitive, hypersafe mentality is parroted by every social media platform,

186
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,360
every corpos, nosy HR department, every nannying university's campus trust and safety council,

187
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,400
every union, every politician, every journalist, actor, musician, or large content creator,

188
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,360
you're not the rebellion, you're the empire.

189
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,220
What I said before still holds true.

190
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,200
These people are moral lobotomites.

191
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,440
They think being good means appearing to be good.

192
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,880
They think morality is something you perform to other people.

193
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,440
Your moral position isn't what you believe, it isn't even what real things you do, it's

194
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,360
how you contort yourself to fit a narrative for the purposes of an audience.

195
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,760
To such people, the worst crime you can commit is simply refusing to go along with their

196
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
theater.

197
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
So, don't.

198
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
Lewis, thank god.

199
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Are you alright?

200
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
I am well.

201
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,760
Don't you recognize me?

202
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
It's Claire.

203
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
Of course.

204
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,160
Claire, you look healthy.

205
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
And happy.

206
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
Lewis, I need to know.

207
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
What did they do to you?

208
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
I did something terrible.

209
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,160
And then I was corrected.

210
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
I'm better now.

211
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
I'm healthier.

212
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,660
And happier.
