00:00.000 --> 00:09.040
YouTube wants to remove the downvote button on videos, again.

00:09.040 --> 00:12.080
This last came up back in 2019, and I made a video on it then.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.160
I actually recommend you go back and watch that one, because today I'm going to be building

00:15.160 --> 00:17.120
on some of the ideas from back then.

00:17.120 --> 00:20.540
But as always, because I love you a lot, I'll give you the TLDR real quick.

00:20.540 --> 00:23.920
In that video I used two then-contemporary examples.

00:23.920 --> 00:28.020
Firstly, the episode of The Orville, where the alien planet they encounter has a government

00:28.020 --> 00:32.300
run by social media votes, and secondly, the Egoraptor controversy, where he had built

00:32.300 --> 00:36.300
a career out of edgy humor, and now that he's comfortably established, wants that humor

00:36.300 --> 00:39.640
and anything else that may make people uncomfortable be banned from the internet.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.420
Both examples, as well as other smaller ones I briefly mentioned, focused on people who

00:43.420 --> 00:47.500
spend too much time on social media, to the point that dislikes and downvotes cripple

00:47.500 --> 00:51.500
their ability to behave normally, and as such, they begin to advocate for the removal of

00:51.500 --> 00:55.400
all negative feedback online, in the hopes that they will never have to experience a

00:55.400 --> 00:57.100
negative emotion ever again.

00:57.100 --> 01:00.500
And if that other people's rights had to be trampled, that was a sacrifice they were

01:00.500 --> 01:01.500
willing to pay.

01:01.500 --> 01:04.980
I referred to this point of view as having had a moral lobotomy, and it's a label that

01:04.980 --> 01:06.160
I still think fits.

01:06.160 --> 01:10.820
The always-on nature of social media, the everything-is-political, nothing-is-private

01:10.820 --> 01:14.980
progressive orientation of the online world nowadays, has created a cast of people who

01:14.980 --> 01:17.780
are constantly emoting for the sake of an audience.

01:17.780 --> 01:21.260
Everything they do is calculated and performed, with no humanity behind it.

01:21.260 --> 01:25.020
And those people who don't perform, who don't turn themselves into an object of theater

01:25.020 --> 01:28.940
during every public moment of their lives, are considered outcasts, even if they're just

01:28.940 --> 01:30.280
behaving neutrally.

01:30.280 --> 01:34.360
The specific launch point for this video is YouTube's newest announcement that the dislike

01:34.360 --> 01:38.060
button is going away, something that they toyed with in 2019 but never actually did.

01:38.060 --> 01:39.320
Here's the video where they announced it.

01:39.320 --> 01:41.320
As expected, it's got 80,000 dislikes.

01:41.320 --> 01:44.560
In that episode of The Orville, there was a guy who had so many dislikes that he was

01:44.560 --> 01:49.540
deemed socially undesirable, and had his brain altered so that he was the perfectly sanitized,

01:49.540 --> 01:51.920
always-emoting social media candidate.

01:51.920 --> 01:54.280
Let's compare his mannerisms and vocabulary to this guy.

02:21.920 --> 02:27.820
Jesus, it was a social commentary on YouTube, you're not actually supposed to turn people

02:27.820 --> 02:28.820
into this.

02:28.820 --> 02:31.080
Okay, fun aside, let's actually go through this video.

02:31.080 --> 02:37.800
Apparently groups of viewers are targeting a video's dislike button to drive up the count,

02:37.800 --> 02:42.680
turning it into something like a game with a visible scoreboard.

02:42.680 --> 02:47.840
And it's usually just because they don't like the creator or what they stand for.

02:47.840 --> 02:52.160
That's a big problem when half of YouTube's mission is to give everyone a voice.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.840
But downvotes don't deny people that voice, do they?

02:54.840 --> 02:58.120
Having a lot of downvotes doesn't mean the video is yeeted off the platform, it's still

02:58.120 --> 02:59.120
engagement.

02:59.120 --> 03:02.160
But more importantly, yes, you're describing a feature, not a flaw.

03:02.160 --> 03:05.560
When he says that the votes are used as a scoreboard in a game, that's correct, and

03:05.560 --> 03:06.680
that's how it should be.

03:06.680 --> 03:09.600
YouTube is ultimately still a place that people use for entertainment, YouTube's official

03:09.600 --> 03:10.880
party line be damned.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.440
And some of the best moments come out of when YouTubers themselves recognize the game, and

03:14.440 --> 03:17.320
ask for their fans to test the limits of YouTube's features.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.760
I literally just want to try something.

03:19.760 --> 03:23.800
If everybody, okay, everybody who's watching this, no I'm serious, I'm fucking serious,

03:23.800 --> 03:27.240
if you have a YouTube account and you're watching this, comment something, anything.

03:27.240 --> 03:32.520
I just want to see, um, like, how comments work on like the rankings.

03:32.520 --> 03:38.120
I legitimately just like want to see, like, what if we get like 90 fucking thousand comments?

03:38.120 --> 03:41.080
Like everybody, just for fun, I'm doing this seriously just as a test.

03:41.080 --> 03:44.320
To see if it like, if it makes us appear on like the front page.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.520
Or like, and like, just to see if YouTube is like, checks us like, what the fuck's going

03:47.520 --> 03:48.520
on here?

03:48.520 --> 03:50.900
Like, let's see how many comments we can get on YouTube.

03:50.900 --> 03:56.160
The update from YouTube is that the dislike button is staying, but the dislike counts

03:56.160 --> 03:58.820
will now be private.

03:58.820 --> 04:03.960
You can still dislike videos and that action will be used to tune your own recommendations,

04:03.960 --> 04:07.240
but you won't be able to see the dislike count.

04:07.240 --> 04:10.480
Only the creator can find it on the back end if they want.

04:10.480 --> 04:13.760
This is contrary to what they said before, where the dislike button would be going away

04:13.760 --> 04:14.760
entirely.

04:14.760 --> 04:16.100
But if it's still there, then what's the point?

04:16.100 --> 04:19.320
They claim us to protect the mental health of creators who get too many downvotes.

04:19.320 --> 04:22.360
But creators can still see these downvotes, it's only the public who can't.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.600
Do you know who this actually protects?

04:23.600 --> 04:27.100
It protects the White House, whose videos have been constantly downvoted into oblivion

04:27.100 --> 04:28.640
ever since Biden took office.

04:28.640 --> 04:33.000
It protects legacy media, who are overwhelmingly rejected in favor of alt-tech nowadays.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.320
It protects Disney and Activision Blizzard and every other shitty corporation that keeps

04:36.320 --> 04:38.940
pumping out garbage from being ridiculed for it.

04:38.940 --> 04:42.960
It protects blue checkmarks, who generally want likes, dislikes, comments, all of it

04:42.960 --> 04:46.880
disabled, on every site everywhere, so they don't have to hear from common people whenever

04:46.880 --> 04:47.880
they say something dumb.

04:47.880 --> 04:51.640
And it certainly protects those thin-skinned, older YouTubers I mentioned in the last video,

04:51.640 --> 04:55.020
who might have been edgy a decade ago, but now they're constantly disabling comments

04:55.020 --> 04:56.020
and banning people.

04:56.020 --> 04:59.180
It's not just YouTube though, every social media site is trending this way.

04:59.180 --> 05:03.820
The only emotion allowed on the internet nowadays is a shallow, vague sense of fake happiness.

05:03.820 --> 05:06.200
How many times have you seen this below a Twitter thread?

05:06.200 --> 05:08.400
Show offensive content, show offensive content, show offensive content.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.560
Never mind that none of the content is actually offensive.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.480
Hell, my Twitter page is marked as dangerous.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.240
It has been for a while, and you want to know why?

05:15.240 --> 05:18.500
It's because I've been rejecting Twitter's requests to verify my phone number.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.500
That's it.

05:19.500 --> 05:20.500
Fuck you, Twitter.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.500
But Twitter does shit like this regularly.

05:21.500 --> 05:24.940
They disable retweets and likes on stuff they say promotes violence, or goes contrary to

05:24.940 --> 05:28.060
the views of their fact-checkers, even if that's obvious bullshit.

05:28.060 --> 05:31.960
Kyle Rittenhouse's Mom's Defense Fund is suppressed by Twitter, despite him clearly

05:31.960 --> 05:33.900
being innocent and acting in self-defense.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.740
The fundraiser sites used for these types of things routinely deplatform people for

05:36.740 --> 05:39.120
no reason other than not liking their political slant.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.080
Facebook nukes whole-ass pages for the flimsiest of reasons.

05:42.080 --> 05:46.040
Hell, as the centralization of internet services has continued, Fandom, the service that provides

05:46.040 --> 05:50.920
for fan-wickies, has decided that no sexual content is allowed on any of their wiki services,

05:50.920 --> 05:54.820
even if the specific show or movie series or game series has sex in it.

05:54.820 --> 05:58.800
This is all part of the always emoting, always on mentality I mentioned before.

05:58.800 --> 06:02.720
The elites need to not only have power, but to also look like they are loving and adored

06:02.720 --> 06:03.720
by the plebs.

06:03.720 --> 06:06.600
And the plebs need to smile and say they like it every time they get raped.

06:06.600 --> 06:10.240
You're being told to love your chains, or at the very least, perform publicly like

06:10.240 --> 06:14.440
you do so that other people develop a sense of crippling self-doubt for wondering if something

06:14.440 --> 06:15.440
might be wrong.

06:15.440 --> 06:19.040
And God forbid you emote in the other direction if you perform in such a way that sheds light

06:19.040 --> 06:20.360
or makes fun of this mentality.

06:20.360 --> 06:24.440
God forbid you use memes to make fun of those in power rather than reinforce the existing

06:24.440 --> 06:25.440
structures.

06:25.440 --> 06:28.840
Recently House Rep Paul Gosar got in trouble for posting a remake of the opening of Attack

06:28.840 --> 06:32.800
on Titan, with illegal immigrants replacing the Titans, border patrol replacing the Survey

06:32.800 --> 06:36.540
Corps, Republicans replacing the main heroes, and it's a bit hard to see, but yes that

06:36.540 --> 06:38.640
is an AOC Titan being killed.

06:38.640 --> 06:43.320
It ends with Gosar himself confronting a giant oblivious Joe Biden in the place of the colossal

06:43.320 --> 06:44.320
Titan.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.520
Now this is fucking hilarious, this is shitpostygoodness.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.360
But it's memeing in the other direction.

06:48.360 --> 06:49.920
It's emoting in the other direction.

06:49.920 --> 06:53.780
It's using the equalizing nature of social media, where anyone can post anything and

06:53.780 --> 06:57.320
anybody can see it, to make fun of the powers that be rather than reinforce them.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.780
So of course the entire internet lost its fucking mind.

06:59.780 --> 07:00.780
Just like they did with Pepe.

07:00.780 --> 07:02.300
Just like they did with the okay hand symbol.

07:02.300 --> 07:05.620
Just like they did with anything that they didn't understand, but seemed to be at their

07:05.620 --> 07:06.620
expense.

07:06.620 --> 07:09.240
The journos and the corpos pearl clutched and said how dare you.

07:09.240 --> 07:12.900
Even Nancy Pelosi said this was a legitimate threat of violence and called on the ethics

07:12.900 --> 07:15.500
committee to investigate the creation of this horrific meme.

07:15.500 --> 07:19.660
And when Gosar replied with a Wojak vs Chad meme, the progressives lost their mind again.

07:19.660 --> 07:22.740
I've mentioned a few times on this channel that tyrants can tolerate people who offer

07:22.740 --> 07:25.660
serious critiques of their regimes, as long as they don't get too uppity.

07:25.660 --> 07:28.380
It's better for somebody to speak and feel as if they've been heard, because then he's

07:28.380 --> 07:29.380
less of a threat.

07:29.380 --> 07:33.260
But tyrants can never tolerate humor, because at least if he's critiqued, he's taken seriously.

07:33.260 --> 07:37.540
If he's laughed at, things only a joke, a farce, not worthy of respect or fear.

07:37.540 --> 07:41.020
A tyrant's only response to being laughed at is violence, that's why they always go

07:41.020 --> 07:42.220
for comedians first.

07:42.220 --> 07:46.220
But that idea, that view on comedy in relation to the tyrant, is another piece of this social

07:46.220 --> 07:47.340
media puzzle.

07:47.340 --> 07:51.060
Social media is that great equalizer, where everybody can see what you post, high status

07:51.060 --> 07:52.060
or low.

07:52.060 --> 07:54.820
But those with high status don't like being told that the rest of us don't like what they

07:54.820 --> 07:55.820
do.

07:55.820 --> 07:58.060
They find it offensive, because I guess if you live your life with privilege and then

07:58.060 --> 08:01.220
suddenly have to experience what it's like to be critiqued by those you look down on,

08:01.220 --> 08:02.600
you probably would feel offended.

08:02.600 --> 08:06.380
So slowly but surely, social media sites will continue to strip away tools that those with

08:06.380 --> 08:08.140
low status use to speak.

08:08.140 --> 08:12.340
Because those high status people in charge of things have realized, more often than not,

08:12.340 --> 08:14.060
those tools are used to speak dissent.

08:14.060 --> 08:17.880
In the late 90s and early 2000s, having a form or a comment section on your website

08:17.880 --> 08:18.880
meant you'd have made it.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.620
You could be a legitimate place for conversation now.

08:20.620 --> 08:24.060
Hell, even a guest book where people could leave comment to serve the same function.

08:24.060 --> 08:27.340
But now, comment sections on news articles are all but gone, because journals don't like

08:27.340 --> 08:28.540
being contradicted.

08:28.540 --> 08:31.660
Rating features are becoming more simplified or removed outright, or in the case of something

08:31.660 --> 08:35.340
like Rotten Tomatoes, repeatedly rigged to present a false air of popularity.

08:35.340 --> 08:38.580
YouTubers disabling comments on their videos is no longer considered a sign of weakness,

08:38.580 --> 08:42.980
as it should be, but instead shows them to be a victim of hate, hate from their own audience.

08:42.980 --> 08:46.820
Content warnings everywhere, fact-checking labels added to posts in real time, the inability

08:46.820 --> 08:50.100
to share content deemed problematic, it's all part of the same thing.

08:50.100 --> 08:54.620
Corpos, journos, politicians, and pearl-clutching progressives have all realized that nobody

08:54.620 --> 08:55.880
fucking likes them.

08:55.880 --> 08:59.200
Nobody wants to adhere to their rules, nobody subscribes to their vision of the future,

08:59.200 --> 09:02.760
and their solution is to restrict speech online to the point that your regular person has

09:02.760 --> 09:06.160
no choice but to either leave a smiling emoji or say nothing at all.

09:06.160 --> 09:10.320
And in fact, depending on where you live, dissenting online might actually be illegal.

09:10.320 --> 09:14.080
Old tech like Newgrounds and 4chan, along with alt-tech like Bitchute and Odyssey, remain

09:14.080 --> 09:15.080
outliers.

09:15.080 --> 09:18.280
They're more committed to free speech than mainline tech, which makes them more fun places

09:18.280 --> 09:19.280
to hang out.

09:19.280 --> 09:23.280
It also explains why they're constantly slandered as alt-right, fascist, nazi, racist, sexist,

09:23.280 --> 09:25.200
transphobic, Islamophobic, you name it, they are it.

09:25.200 --> 09:29.760
But that's the counterculture nowadays, these outside spaces, these new wild wests,

09:29.760 --> 09:30.760
where the rules are few.

09:30.760 --> 09:34.140
It's not these sanitized platforms that only serve to inject dopamine into the base

09:34.140 --> 09:38.120
of your skull until you realize you've wasted the last decade of your life doomscrolling.

09:38.120 --> 09:42.500
If your hypersensitive, hypersafe mentality is parroted by every social media platform,

09:42.500 --> 09:47.360
every corpos, nosy HR department, every nannying university's campus trust and safety council,

09:47.360 --> 09:51.400
every union, every politician, every journalist, actor, musician, or large content creator,

09:51.400 --> 09:53.360
you're not the rebellion, you're the empire.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.220
What I said before still holds true.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.200
These people are moral lobotomites.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.440
They think being good means appearing to be good.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.880
They think morality is something you perform to other people.

10:01.880 --> 10:05.440
Your moral position isn't what you believe, it isn't even what real things you do, it's

10:05.440 --> 10:08.360
how you contort yourself to fit a narrative for the purposes of an audience.

10:08.360 --> 10:11.760
To such people, the worst crime you can commit is simply refusing to go along with their

10:11.760 --> 10:12.760
theater.

10:12.760 --> 10:13.760
So, don't.

10:13.760 --> 10:14.760
Lewis, thank god.

10:14.760 --> 10:15.760
Are you alright?

10:15.760 --> 10:16.760
I am well.

10:16.760 --> 10:17.760
Don't you recognize me?

10:17.760 --> 10:18.760
It's Claire.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.160
Of course.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.160
Claire, you look healthy.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.160
And happy.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.160
Lewis, I need to know.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.160
What did they do to you?

10:24.160 --> 10:25.160
I did something terrible.

10:25.160 --> 10:26.160
And then I was corrected.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.160
I'm better now.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.160
I'm healthier.

10:28.160 --> 10:28.660
And happier.
