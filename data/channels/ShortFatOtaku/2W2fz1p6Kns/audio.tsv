0	9040	YouTube wants to remove the downvote button on videos, again.
9040	12080	This last came up back in 2019, and I made a video on it then.
12080	15160	I actually recommend you go back and watch that one, because today I'm going to be building
15160	17120	on some of the ideas from back then.
17120	20540	But as always, because I love you a lot, I'll give you the TLDR real quick.
20540	23920	In that video I used two then-contemporary examples.
23920	28020	Firstly, the episode of The Orville, where the alien planet they encounter has a government
28020	32300	run by social media votes, and secondly, the Egoraptor controversy, where he had built
32300	36300	a career out of edgy humor, and now that he's comfortably established, wants that humor
36300	39640	and anything else that may make people uncomfortable be banned from the internet.
39640	43420	Both examples, as well as other smaller ones I briefly mentioned, focused on people who
43420	47500	spend too much time on social media, to the point that dislikes and downvotes cripple
47500	51500	their ability to behave normally, and as such, they begin to advocate for the removal of
51500	55400	all negative feedback online, in the hopes that they will never have to experience a
55400	57100	negative emotion ever again.
57100	60500	And if that other people's rights had to be trampled, that was a sacrifice they were
60500	61500	willing to pay.
61500	64980	I referred to this point of view as having had a moral lobotomy, and it's a label that
64980	66160	I still think fits.
66160	70820	The always-on nature of social media, the everything-is-political, nothing-is-private
70820	74980	progressive orientation of the online world nowadays, has created a cast of people who
74980	77780	are constantly emoting for the sake of an audience.
77780	81260	Everything they do is calculated and performed, with no humanity behind it.
81260	85020	And those people who don't perform, who don't turn themselves into an object of theater
85020	88940	during every public moment of their lives, are considered outcasts, even if they're just
88940	90280	behaving neutrally.
90280	94360	The specific launch point for this video is YouTube's newest announcement that the dislike
94360	98060	button is going away, something that they toyed with in 2019 but never actually did.
98060	99320	Here's the video where they announced it.
99320	101320	As expected, it's got 80,000 dislikes.
101320	104560	In that episode of The Orville, there was a guy who had so many dislikes that he was
104560	109540	deemed socially undesirable, and had his brain altered so that he was the perfectly sanitized,
109540	111920	always-emoting social media candidate.
111920	114280	Let's compare his mannerisms and vocabulary to this guy.
141920	147820	Jesus, it was a social commentary on YouTube, you're not actually supposed to turn people
147820	148820	into this.
148820	151080	Okay, fun aside, let's actually go through this video.
151080	157800	Apparently groups of viewers are targeting a video's dislike button to drive up the count,
157800	162680	turning it into something like a game with a visible scoreboard.
162680	167840	And it's usually just because they don't like the creator or what they stand for.
167840	172160	That's a big problem when half of YouTube's mission is to give everyone a voice.
172160	174840	But downvotes don't deny people that voice, do they?
174840	178120	Having a lot of downvotes doesn't mean the video is yeeted off the platform, it's still
178120	179120	engagement.
179120	182160	But more importantly, yes, you're describing a feature, not a flaw.
182160	185560	When he says that the votes are used as a scoreboard in a game, that's correct, and
185560	186680	that's how it should be.
186680	189600	YouTube is ultimately still a place that people use for entertainment, YouTube's official
189600	190880	party line be damned.
190880	194440	And some of the best moments come out of when YouTubers themselves recognize the game, and
194440	197320	ask for their fans to test the limits of YouTube's features.
197320	199760	I literally just want to try something.
199760	203800	If everybody, okay, everybody who's watching this, no I'm serious, I'm fucking serious,
203800	207240	if you have a YouTube account and you're watching this, comment something, anything.
207240	212520	I just want to see, um, like, how comments work on like the rankings.
212520	218120	I legitimately just like want to see, like, what if we get like 90 fucking thousand comments?
218120	221080	Like everybody, just for fun, I'm doing this seriously just as a test.
221080	224320	To see if it like, if it makes us appear on like the front page.
224320	227520	Or like, and like, just to see if YouTube is like, checks us like, what the fuck's going
227520	228520	on here?
228520	230900	Like, let's see how many comments we can get on YouTube.
230900	236160	The update from YouTube is that the dislike button is staying, but the dislike counts
236160	238820	will now be private.
238820	243960	You can still dislike videos and that action will be used to tune your own recommendations,
243960	247240	but you won't be able to see the dislike count.
247240	250480	Only the creator can find it on the back end if they want.
250480	253760	This is contrary to what they said before, where the dislike button would be going away
253760	254760	entirely.
254760	256100	But if it's still there, then what's the point?
256100	259320	They claim us to protect the mental health of creators who get too many downvotes.
259320	262360	But creators can still see these downvotes, it's only the public who can't.
262360	263600	Do you know who this actually protects?
263600	267100	It protects the White House, whose videos have been constantly downvoted into oblivion
267100	268640	ever since Biden took office.
268640	273000	It protects legacy media, who are overwhelmingly rejected in favor of alt-tech nowadays.
273000	276320	It protects Disney and Activision Blizzard and every other shitty corporation that keeps
276320	278940	pumping out garbage from being ridiculed for it.
278940	282960	It protects blue checkmarks, who generally want likes, dislikes, comments, all of it
282960	286880	disabled, on every site everywhere, so they don't have to hear from common people whenever
286880	287880	they say something dumb.
287880	291640	And it certainly protects those thin-skinned, older YouTubers I mentioned in the last video,
291640	295020	who might have been edgy a decade ago, but now they're constantly disabling comments
295020	296020	and banning people.
296020	299180	It's not just YouTube though, every social media site is trending this way.
299180	303820	The only emotion allowed on the internet nowadays is a shallow, vague sense of fake happiness.
303820	306200	How many times have you seen this below a Twitter thread?
306200	308400	Show offensive content, show offensive content, show offensive content.
308400	310560	Never mind that none of the content is actually offensive.
310560	313480	Hell, my Twitter page is marked as dangerous.
313480	315240	It has been for a while, and you want to know why?
315240	318500	It's because I've been rejecting Twitter's requests to verify my phone number.
318500	319500	That's it.
319500	320500	Fuck you, Twitter.
320500	321500	But Twitter does shit like this regularly.
321500	324940	They disable retweets and likes on stuff they say promotes violence, or goes contrary to
324940	328060	the views of their fact-checkers, even if that's obvious bullshit.
328060	331960	Kyle Rittenhouse's Mom's Defense Fund is suppressed by Twitter, despite him clearly
331960	333900	being innocent and acting in self-defense.
333900	336740	The fundraiser sites used for these types of things routinely deplatform people for
336740	339120	no reason other than not liking their political slant.
339120	342080	Facebook nukes whole-ass pages for the flimsiest of reasons.
342080	346040	Hell, as the centralization of internet services has continued, Fandom, the service that provides
346040	350920	for fan-wickies, has decided that no sexual content is allowed on any of their wiki services,
350920	354820	even if the specific show or movie series or game series has sex in it.
354820	358800	This is all part of the always emoting, always on mentality I mentioned before.
358800	362720	The elites need to not only have power, but to also look like they are loving and adored
362720	363720	by the plebs.
363720	366600	And the plebs need to smile and say they like it every time they get raped.
366600	370240	You're being told to love your chains, or at the very least, perform publicly like
370240	374440	you do so that other people develop a sense of crippling self-doubt for wondering if something
374440	375440	might be wrong.
375440	379040	And God forbid you emote in the other direction if you perform in such a way that sheds light
379040	380360	or makes fun of this mentality.
380360	384440	God forbid you use memes to make fun of those in power rather than reinforce the existing
384440	385440	structures.
385440	388840	Recently House Rep Paul Gosar got in trouble for posting a remake of the opening of Attack
388840	392800	on Titan, with illegal immigrants replacing the Titans, border patrol replacing the Survey
392800	396540	Corps, Republicans replacing the main heroes, and it's a bit hard to see, but yes that
396540	398640	is an AOC Titan being killed.
398640	403320	It ends with Gosar himself confronting a giant oblivious Joe Biden in the place of the colossal
403320	404320	Titan.
404320	406520	Now this is fucking hilarious, this is shitpostygoodness.
406520	408360	But it's memeing in the other direction.
408360	409920	It's emoting in the other direction.
409920	413780	It's using the equalizing nature of social media, where anyone can post anything and
413780	417320	anybody can see it, to make fun of the powers that be rather than reinforce them.
417320	419780	So of course the entire internet lost its fucking mind.
419780	420780	Just like they did with Pepe.
420780	422300	Just like they did with the okay hand symbol.
422300	425620	Just like they did with anything that they didn't understand, but seemed to be at their
425620	426620	expense.
426620	429240	The journos and the corpos pearl clutched and said how dare you.
429240	432900	Even Nancy Pelosi said this was a legitimate threat of violence and called on the ethics
432900	435500	committee to investigate the creation of this horrific meme.
435500	439660	And when Gosar replied with a Wojak vs Chad meme, the progressives lost their mind again.
439660	442740	I've mentioned a few times on this channel that tyrants can tolerate people who offer
442740	445660	serious critiques of their regimes, as long as they don't get too uppity.
445660	448380	It's better for somebody to speak and feel as if they've been heard, because then he's
448380	449380	less of a threat.
449380	453260	But tyrants can never tolerate humor, because at least if he's critiqued, he's taken seriously.
453260	457540	If he's laughed at, things only a joke, a farce, not worthy of respect or fear.
457540	461020	A tyrant's only response to being laughed at is violence, that's why they always go
461020	462220	for comedians first.
462220	466220	But that idea, that view on comedy in relation to the tyrant, is another piece of this social
466220	467340	media puzzle.
467340	471060	Social media is that great equalizer, where everybody can see what you post, high status
471060	472060	or low.
472060	474820	But those with high status don't like being told that the rest of us don't like what they
474820	475820	do.
475820	478060	They find it offensive, because I guess if you live your life with privilege and then
478060	481220	suddenly have to experience what it's like to be critiqued by those you look down on,
481220	482600	you probably would feel offended.
482600	486380	So slowly but surely, social media sites will continue to strip away tools that those with
486380	488140	low status use to speak.
488140	492340	Because those high status people in charge of things have realized, more often than not,
492340	494060	those tools are used to speak dissent.
494060	497880	In the late 90s and early 2000s, having a form or a comment section on your website
497880	498880	meant you'd have made it.
498880	500620	You could be a legitimate place for conversation now.
500620	504060	Hell, even a guest book where people could leave comment to serve the same function.
504060	507340	But now, comment sections on news articles are all but gone, because journals don't like
507340	508540	being contradicted.
508540	511660	Rating features are becoming more simplified or removed outright, or in the case of something
511660	515340	like Rotten Tomatoes, repeatedly rigged to present a false air of popularity.
515340	518580	YouTubers disabling comments on their videos is no longer considered a sign of weakness,
518580	522980	as it should be, but instead shows them to be a victim of hate, hate from their own audience.
522980	526820	Content warnings everywhere, fact-checking labels added to posts in real time, the inability
526820	530100	to share content deemed problematic, it's all part of the same thing.
530100	534620	Corpos, journos, politicians, and pearl-clutching progressives have all realized that nobody
534620	535880	fucking likes them.
535880	539200	Nobody wants to adhere to their rules, nobody subscribes to their vision of the future,
539200	542760	and their solution is to restrict speech online to the point that your regular person has
542760	546160	no choice but to either leave a smiling emoji or say nothing at all.
546160	550320	And in fact, depending on where you live, dissenting online might actually be illegal.
550320	554080	Old tech like Newgrounds and 4chan, along with alt-tech like Bitchute and Odyssey, remain
554080	555080	outliers.
555080	558280	They're more committed to free speech than mainline tech, which makes them more fun places
558280	559280	to hang out.
559280	563280	It also explains why they're constantly slandered as alt-right, fascist, nazi, racist, sexist,
563280	565200	transphobic, Islamophobic, you name it, they are it.
565200	569760	But that's the counterculture nowadays, these outside spaces, these new wild wests,
569760	570760	where the rules are few.
570760	574140	It's not these sanitized platforms that only serve to inject dopamine into the base
574140	578120	of your skull until you realize you've wasted the last decade of your life doomscrolling.
578120	582500	If your hypersensitive, hypersafe mentality is parroted by every social media platform,
582500	587360	every corpos, nosy HR department, every nannying university's campus trust and safety council,
587360	591400	every union, every politician, every journalist, actor, musician, or large content creator,
591400	593360	you're not the rebellion, you're the empire.
593520	595220	What I said before still holds true.
595220	597200	These people are moral lobotomites.
597200	599440	They think being good means appearing to be good.
599440	601880	They think morality is something you perform to other people.
601880	605440	Your moral position isn't what you believe, it isn't even what real things you do, it's
605440	608360	how you contort yourself to fit a narrative for the purposes of an audience.
608360	611760	To such people, the worst crime you can commit is simply refusing to go along with their
611760	612760	theater.
612760	613760	So, don't.
613760	614760	Lewis, thank god.
614760	615760	Are you alright?
615760	616760	I am well.
616760	617760	Don't you recognize me?
617760	618760	It's Claire.
619160	620160	Of course.
620160	621160	Claire, you look healthy.
621160	622160	And happy.
622160	623160	Lewis, I need to know.
623160	624160	What did they do to you?
624160	625160	I did something terrible.
625160	626160	And then I was corrected.
626160	627160	I'm better now.
627160	628160	I'm healthier.
628160	628660	And happier.
