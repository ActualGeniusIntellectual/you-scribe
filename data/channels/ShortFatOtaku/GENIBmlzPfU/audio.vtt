00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Oh Justin Trudeau, a lot of Canadians had high hopes for you.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.560
I know I didn't, which is why I didn't vote for you.

00:06.560 --> 00:10.360
But a lot of people did, and most of them are just now beginning to realize exactly

00:10.360 --> 00:12.080
what kind of man they voted for.

00:12.080 --> 00:17.040
Trudeau's gotten a lot of online international attention recently, due to Motion 103, which

00:17.040 --> 00:18.440
I'll discuss a little bit later.

00:18.440 --> 00:22.400
But as a Canadian myself, I think it's important to talk about a lot of the other things, the

00:22.400 --> 00:26.200
domestic stuff that might not make it into the news in the US or UK.

00:26.200 --> 00:30.560
And yes, I do think it's important for people in the US or the UK to know what's going on

00:30.560 --> 00:31.560
in Canada.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.120
I know we're just Canada guys.

00:33.120 --> 00:38.720
But we're still a large world economy, a middle power militarily, and most importantly, Justin

00:38.720 --> 00:42.120
Trudeau is a canary in the coal mine for the rest of you, regarding what happens when a

00:42.120 --> 00:47.120
hard left candidate not only takes office, but with a decisive majority in a modern first

00:47.120 --> 00:48.120
world country.

00:48.120 --> 00:53.040
For those of you not in the know, Justin Trudeau is sort of like our Obama, minus the opposition

00:53.040 --> 00:56.160
obstructionism as well as Obama's public speaking ability.

00:56.160 --> 01:00.920
You'll be running against Stephen Harper in the next election.

01:00.920 --> 01:10.480
I think so I've, you know, we, you know what, I'll let I'll let the conservatives figure

01:10.480 --> 01:11.480
that one out.

01:11.480 --> 01:15.080
Their campaigns were run remarkably similar in that they both emphasize their candidates

01:15.080 --> 01:18.440
youth as a way to show that they were more connected and knowledgeable but the problems

01:18.440 --> 01:19.960
a modern nation faces.

01:19.960 --> 01:24.700
They also both abandoned that rhetoric after taking office, instead opting to pursue corporate

01:24.700 --> 01:26.200
left interests.

01:26.200 --> 01:30.380
But to really get into the trouble with Justin Trudeau, we have to go back, way back.

01:30.380 --> 01:34.700
All the way back to Justin's father, the 15th Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Trudeau.

01:34.700 --> 01:39.340
A quick note here before we begin, I'm about to provide a lot of Canadian political history,

01:39.340 --> 01:43.160
as I suspect most viewers of this video won't be Canadian and won't know about the political

01:43.160 --> 01:45.800
climate that allowed Justin Trudeau to become Prime Minister.

01:45.800 --> 01:49.640
I think it's important to describe the way the stage was set before Trudeau's arrival,

01:49.640 --> 01:53.260
but if you're just not interested in that, you can jump ahead to the time shown here

01:53.260 --> 01:56.020
where I'll get into the meat of Justin Trudeau's actions.

01:56.020 --> 02:00.460
I warn you though, without the proper context, they may not make as much sense.

02:00.460 --> 02:04.000
Pierre Trudeau was one of Canada's most popular and longest serving Prime Ministers

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
in history.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.220
The large amount of public infatuation with him was nicknamed Trudeau-mania by the media

02:09.220 --> 02:13.620
at the time, a label that very briefly came back into public use to describe Justin during

02:13.620 --> 02:14.620
his own campaign.

02:14.620 --> 02:19.540
Trudeau spent his youth as what we would call today a proto-SJW, interested in topics such

02:19.540 --> 02:21.220
as Marxism and feminism.

02:21.220 --> 02:25.420
And even though Trudeau would not be a radical Marxist or feminist during his political career,

02:25.420 --> 02:29.360
it is safe to say that those ideas helped inform his moderate liberalism.

02:29.360 --> 02:34.580
As Justice Minister, he legalized homosexuality and created more flexible divorce laws.

02:34.580 --> 02:39.380
And as Prime Minister, he helped bring Canada into the G7 as a world economic power, he

02:39.380 --> 02:43.600
passed the Access to Information Act, the Canada Health Act, brought the Canadian Charter

02:43.600 --> 02:48.220
of Rights and Freedoms into force, modernized Canada's constitution, and used the government

02:48.220 --> 02:51.940
to help secure Canadian economic resources and infrastructure through projects like the

02:51.940 --> 02:57.060
Via Rail, Petro-Canada, and the NEP, all the while giving Bruce Bolton a run for his money

02:57.060 --> 02:58.740
in the evil looks department.

02:58.740 --> 03:02.540
Basically, Pierre Trudeau was just like what you'd expect out of a liberal whose formative

03:02.540 --> 03:04.900
years were entirely post-World War II.

03:04.900 --> 03:08.940
He was a hippie who used the power of the government to expand civil rights for citizens.

03:08.940 --> 03:13.180
And he also used that power to either regulate or directly compete with private companies

03:13.180 --> 03:15.340
in a number of civil service industries.

03:15.340 --> 03:18.420
But his past within Marxism hadn't made him a bleeding heart either.

03:18.420 --> 03:23.820
When the FLQ, a Marxist terrorist group operating in Quebec, began to kidnap government officials,

03:23.820 --> 03:27.620
Pierre used the War Measures Act to temporarily suspend civil liberties in order to break

03:27.620 --> 03:29.300
the group, with public support.

04:15.340 --> 04:17.180
Now, this is less than responsible.

04:17.180 --> 04:20.700
I was suggesting that you should perhaps use a bit more restraint, which you're not doing

04:20.700 --> 04:21.700
now.

04:21.700 --> 04:23.820
You're going to make a big news item of this, I'm sure.

04:23.820 --> 04:26.820
Well, with great respect, it is a big news item.

04:26.820 --> 04:31.500
Yeah, but the main thing that the FLQ is trying to gain from this is a hell of a lot of publicity

04:31.500 --> 04:32.500
for the movement.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.500
Recognition?

04:33.500 --> 04:37.500
Yeah, and I'm suggesting that the more recognition you give to them, the greater their victory

04:37.500 --> 04:38.500
is.

04:38.500 --> 04:39.500
And I'm not interested in giving them a victory.

04:39.500 --> 04:47.460
Surely it's a proposition that perhaps it would be wise to use less inflammatory terms

04:47.460 --> 04:52.700
than bandits when you talk of a bunch of people who have the lives of two men in their hands.

04:52.700 --> 04:55.500
You don't think they're bandits?

04:55.500 --> 05:00.560
I explain it badly, I think, but what you're talking about, to me, is choices.

05:00.560 --> 05:04.180
My choice is to live in a society that is free and democratic, which means that you

05:04.180 --> 05:07.620
don't have people with guns running around in it.

05:07.620 --> 05:12.120
And one of the things I have to give up for that choice is the fact that people like you

05:12.120 --> 05:13.120
may be kidnapped.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.120
Sure.

05:14.120 --> 05:17.220
Sir, if you had to, right now...

05:17.220 --> 05:21.180
But this isn't my choice, obviously.

05:21.180 --> 05:25.580
I think it's more important to get rid of those who are committing violence against

05:25.580 --> 05:30.540
the total society, and those who are trying to run the government through a parallel power

05:30.540 --> 05:34.300
by establishing their authority by kidnapping and blackmail.

05:34.300 --> 05:40.940
And I think it's our duty as a government to protect government officials and important

05:40.940 --> 05:45.820
people in our society against being used as tools in this blackmail.

05:45.820 --> 05:50.860
Now, you don't agree to this, but I'm sure that, once again, with hindsight, you would

05:50.860 --> 05:56.980
have probably found it preferable if Mr. Cross and Mr. Laporte had been protected from kidnapping,

05:56.980 --> 06:00.900
which they weren't, because the steps we're taking now weren't taken.

06:00.900 --> 06:07.100
But even with your hindsight, I don't see how you can deny that.

06:07.100 --> 06:11.180
No, I still go back to the choice that you have to make in the kind of society that you

06:11.180 --> 06:12.180
live in.

06:12.180 --> 06:15.260
Well, there's a lot of bleeding hearts around who just don't like to see people with helmets

06:15.260 --> 06:16.260
and guns.

06:16.260 --> 06:18.100
All I can say is, go on and bleed.

06:18.100 --> 06:24.420
But it's more important to keep law and order in this society than to be worried about weak-kneed

06:24.420 --> 06:28.660
people who don't like the looks of a sort of emirate.

06:28.660 --> 06:29.660
At any cost?

06:29.660 --> 06:30.660
At any cost?

06:30.660 --> 06:31.660
How would you extend that?

06:31.660 --> 06:32.900
Just watch me.

06:32.900 --> 06:36.780
And then there is, of course, the joke that Pierre Trudeau didn't actually father Justin,

06:36.780 --> 06:41.200
but Fidel Castro did, considering Margot Trudeau's cozy relationship with the Cuban dictator,

06:41.200 --> 06:43.980
as well as how much Fidel and Justin look alike as adults.

06:43.980 --> 06:46.860
It's probably not true, but hey, memers got a meme.

06:46.860 --> 06:50.420
In the end, there is good reason for Pierre Trudeau to be considered one of Canada's

06:50.420 --> 06:51.980
most popular Prime Ministers.

06:51.980 --> 06:56.100
He did a lot to modernize Canada, secure civil rights, and bring in social programs that

06:56.100 --> 07:00.160
Canadians today are both proud of and use regularly, all the while having a political

07:00.160 --> 07:02.400
backbone that was unusual at the time.

07:02.400 --> 07:06.400
Justin, well, doesn't really follow in his father's footsteps.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.980
Let's look at the situation surrounding Justin Trudeau's election.

07:09.980 --> 07:13.840
The Liberal Party has fielded more governments and Prime Ministers than any other party in

07:13.840 --> 07:16.720
Canada's history, earning the nickname the Natural Governing Party.

07:16.720 --> 07:20.580
In response to this, throughout the 90s and early 2000s, most of Canada's right-wing

07:20.580 --> 07:25.160
parties would merge to become the modern Conservative Party, otherwise known as the Tories.

07:25.160 --> 07:29.120
From then on, five parties would have some level of political capital on the national

07:29.120 --> 07:30.120
stage.

07:30.120 --> 07:33.480
The Labour Party and Conservative Party would represent your general centre-left and centre-right

07:33.480 --> 07:37.900
positions, similar to your average Democratic and Republican politician in the US.

07:37.900 --> 07:42.280
The New Democratic Party, otherwise known as the NDP, are the hard-left European-style

07:42.280 --> 07:44.660
socialist party of Bernie Sanders' dreams.

07:44.660 --> 07:49.160
The Bloc, a party with policies that vary between both left and right, but primarily

07:49.160 --> 07:51.440
concerns itself with Quebec sovereignty.

07:51.440 --> 07:55.280
And the Green Party, which sits somewhere between the Liberals and the NDP but focuses

07:55.280 --> 07:59.460
on the environment, and has never held any seats in the Canadian Senate, or more than

07:59.460 --> 08:01.600
two seats in the House of Commons.

08:01.600 --> 08:05.580
Throughout this period, the Liberal Party had been wracked by multiple corruption scandals,

08:05.580 --> 08:10.060
and during the 2006 federal election, Stephen Harper led the Conservatives to victory.

08:10.060 --> 08:15.580
However, because the Conservatives only held 124 seats in the House out of a total of 308,

08:15.580 --> 08:18.380
Harper led a minority government in the 39th Parliament.

08:18.380 --> 08:22.220
Extreme road-blocking from the Bloc, as well as multiple attempted votes of no confidence,

08:22.220 --> 08:25.940
led to another election two years later, where Harper's Conservatives won roughly the same

08:25.940 --> 08:28.380
number of seats in the 40th Parliament.

08:28.380 --> 08:31.940
During the 40th Parliament, Harper would pro-rogue Parliament twice in order to break

08:31.940 --> 08:34.860
the will of his political opponents, sparking protests.

08:34.860 --> 08:39.020
This, along with Harper's cabinet being found in contempt of Parliament, an event

08:39.020 --> 08:43.500
that had never before happened in any Commonwealth country, led to all of the other parties opposing

08:43.500 --> 08:44.820
the government's budget.

08:44.820 --> 08:46.740
Without a budget, another election was called.

08:46.740 --> 08:51.300
The election of the 41st Parliament saw Stephen Harper take a majority, despite the Tory scandals

08:51.300 --> 08:52.780
of the 40th.

08:52.780 --> 08:54.180
This is due to several reasons.

08:54.180 --> 08:58.820
One, even though the NDP had never formed a government or held official opposition status,

08:58.820 --> 09:04.060
the NDP's leader, Jack Layton, had become extremely popular throughout Canada personally,

09:04.060 --> 09:06.300
especially among the Trekkie population.

09:06.300 --> 09:09.600
It was no secret that Layton's health had been deteriorating due to prostate cancer

09:09.600 --> 09:13.180
throughout the election, and despite this, he continued to campaign.

09:13.180 --> 09:18.460
At the same time, the Liberal leader, Michael Ignatieff, well, just look at this man.

09:18.460 --> 09:22.340
I promise you, you'll never see a more bland, milquetoast, history-teacher-looking guy in

09:22.340 --> 09:23.340
your life.

09:23.500 --> 09:26.860
Oh, he actually was a history teacher.

09:26.860 --> 09:31.140
Ignatieff's exceptionally poor performance at the debates in contrast with Layton's,

09:43.140 --> 09:47.260
as well as the lingering memory of Liberal corruption, led to the Liberals taking only

09:47.260 --> 09:51.020
34 seats and becoming the third party for the first time in history.

09:51.020 --> 09:55.220
Killing that vacuum was the NDP, on the back of the charisma and love surrounding Jack

09:55.220 --> 09:57.080
Layton, and the Tories.

09:57.080 --> 10:00.880
In essence, Stephen Harper didn't necessarily win a majority government for himself.

10:00.880 --> 10:04.820
He won it because the Liberals were exceptionally incompetent and a small-time third party ended

10:04.820 --> 10:05.820
up usurping them.

10:05.820 --> 10:10.540
As a majority government, Harper had a guaranteed four years of prime ministership with no possibility

10:10.540 --> 10:12.260
of an early election being called.

10:12.260 --> 10:16.260
In this time, he destroyed the unions that protected workers for Crown corporations,

10:16.260 --> 10:20.580
intensified Canada's own war on drugs, negotiated Canada's role in the Trans-Pacific

10:20.580 --> 10:24.620
Partnership, massively expanded the government and law enforcement powers to collect data

10:24.620 --> 10:27.940
and spy on Canadian citizens, and removed environmental protections.

10:27.940 --> 10:31.660
A lot of those things Obama did in the USA, at around the same time.

10:31.660 --> 10:37.220
It's almost like there's no real difference between the institutional left and the institutional

10:37.220 --> 10:39.000
right, you guys.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.620
By the time Harper's four years were up, Canadians were absolutely fed up with the

10:42.620 --> 10:43.620
man.

10:43.620 --> 10:47.420
He was popular, but when his hands were inbound in a majority parliament, he made some extremely

10:47.420 --> 10:51.280
unpopular decisions, and left the office as one of the least popular prime ministers of

10:51.280 --> 10:52.280
all time.

10:52.280 --> 10:57.580
In the NDP, Jack Layton's replacement after his death was a slimy, goonie beard man whose

10:57.580 --> 11:00.900
speech and actions both caused him to be considered untrustworthy.

11:00.900 --> 11:04.660
And after Ignatieff's massive failure in the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau rose to

11:04.660 --> 11:06.260
power as the party leader.

11:06.260 --> 11:10.460
And to his credit, Trudeau did spend a lot of political capital wiping clean the old

11:10.460 --> 11:12.920
corruption scandals through party purges.

11:12.920 --> 11:16.320
As for Ignatieff, one of the biggest lines of attack against him during the election

11:16.320 --> 11:19.820
was that he had spent more of his adult life living overseas than actually in Canada.

11:19.820 --> 11:23.520
And that when he inevitably lost, he'd be hightailing it right on out again.

11:23.520 --> 11:24.800
And what did he do?

11:24.800 --> 11:26.440
Oh, he went to teach at Harvard.

11:26.440 --> 11:27.500
And then Budapest.

11:27.500 --> 11:30.840
You know, I doubt you'll ever get back into politics, Mike.

11:30.840 --> 11:34.960
But if you do, maybe don't make political speeches to an electorate like you'd reprimand

11:34.960 --> 11:37.400
a kid for not handing in his homework on time.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.240
So let's quickly recap.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.500
Justin Trudeau hit the election for the 42nd parliament with a lot of things going for

11:42.500 --> 11:43.500
him.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.500
Youth.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.180
Rhetoric that younger Canadians reverberated with.

11:46.180 --> 11:48.460
Popular left-wing political positions.

11:48.460 --> 11:50.640
In essence, a redo of Trudomania.

11:50.640 --> 11:55.400
He also led a rejuvenated, reformed Liberal Party against a universally despised Tory

11:55.400 --> 12:00.860
Prime Minister and an NDP opposition leader who took a powerful legacy and basically destroyed

12:00.860 --> 12:05.380
it, trying to create the same cult of personality around himself that organically grew around

12:05.380 --> 12:06.460
his predecessor.

12:06.460 --> 12:09.580
Therefore it was no surprise to anybody that Trudeau won a majority.

12:09.580 --> 12:14.140
But as it turns out, candidate Trudeau is not the same person as Prime Minister Trudeau.

12:14.140 --> 12:18.900
The website TrudeauMeter.ca tracks all of Trudeau's campaign promises, lists which

12:18.900 --> 12:22.740
ones he's accomplished, which ones he's still working on, which he's not yet done

12:22.740 --> 12:25.540
any work on, and which he's actively broken.

12:25.540 --> 12:29.460
Looking over the list of broken promises, it's no surprise that most of them are economic

12:29.460 --> 12:30.500
policies.

12:30.500 --> 12:34.580
For all of the genuinely evil shit Harper did to Canada during his tenure, his educational

12:34.580 --> 12:36.160
background is in economics.

12:36.160 --> 12:39.520
And he led Canada through the 2008 Great Recession mostly unscathed.

12:39.520 --> 12:43.560
Meanwhile, Trudeau's educational background is in literature and education, with both

12:43.560 --> 12:47.820
an engineering degree and an environmental geography degree having gone uncompleted before

12:47.820 --> 12:49.640
he decided to get into politics.

12:49.640 --> 12:54.000
His lack of economic experience, combined with a far-left view on how the economy should

12:54.000 --> 12:58.040
function, is probably what led him to promise everything under the sun while still somehow

12:58.040 --> 12:59.960
maintaining a balanced budget.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.880
And when questioned on this, Trudeau just didn't know what to say.

13:02.880 --> 13:06.840
I'll put in a full exchange here at a town hall at Western University, just to show you

13:06.840 --> 13:07.840
what I mean.

13:07.840 --> 13:08.840
Hello, Justin.

13:08.840 --> 13:09.840
Hello.

13:09.840 --> 13:18.080
My name is Zach, I am 21 years old, and I am here today to speak on behalf of the silent

13:18.080 --> 13:20.320
majority in this country.

13:20.320 --> 13:24.440
When you were running for the office of Prime Minister, your party said that Canada would

13:24.440 --> 13:28.760
run modest $10 billion deficits until the end of your term.

13:28.760 --> 13:31.480
Then the budget would become balanced.

13:31.480 --> 13:34.000
One year later, that is clearly no longer the case.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.520
In the most recent update of long-term economic and fiscal projections released by the Department

13:39.520 --> 13:45.320
of Finance, it is predicted that under your government, we will run deficits every year

13:45.320 --> 13:53.320
until 2055, and we will have an enormous $1.5 trillion in debt, $1.5 trillion.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.080
That is totally unacceptable.

13:55.080 --> 13:59.300
To give some people some perspective, in the final year of our previous government, that

13:59.300 --> 14:05.900
very same fiscal report projected we would have a $160 billion surplus by the year 2040.

14:05.900 --> 14:08.440
Justin, what are you doing to this country?

14:08.440 --> 14:12.680
You are intentionally setting up millions of young Canadians, like myself, for complete

14:12.680 --> 14:14.500
and utter failure.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.500
And what?

14:15.500 --> 14:16.500
And for what?

14:16.500 --> 14:19.500
To pander to your own moral superiority complex?

14:19.500 --> 14:23.620
If you care about young Canadians and the future of this country, you need to stop what

14:23.620 --> 14:25.020
you are doing right now.

14:25.020 --> 14:32.300
Please, please, hey, everyone, this is an open town hall, if you need the proof.

14:32.300 --> 14:36.980
And we'll let Zach finish his question, please.

14:36.980 --> 14:42.260
My question is this, what, if anything, are you going to do to curb your insane and reckless

14:42.260 --> 14:46.580
spending habits, which are on the verge of being criminal, to make sure that we do not

14:46.580 --> 14:50.860
end up being $1.5 trillion in debt as your government predicts?

14:50.860 --> 14:52.860
Okay, thank you.

14:52.860 --> 15:04.940
Now, in the last election, three parties were in significant contention for earning the

15:04.940 --> 15:07.980
trust to govern this country.

15:07.980 --> 15:13.220
Two of them made the decision that they were going to balance the books at all costs.

15:13.220 --> 15:20.540
One party, my party, took the decision, recognized that what this country needed was investment

15:20.540 --> 15:26.740
in our infrastructure, in the middle class, we needed to help people get ahead, because

15:26.740 --> 15:32.300
quite frankly, under the previous government, we'd had the worst record on growth since

15:32.300 --> 15:35.020
R.B. Bennett in the depths of the Great Depression.

15:35.020 --> 15:39.380
We needed to face down the challenge that we're seeing all around the world right now

15:39.380 --> 15:44.900
of a middle class that doesn't feel like success is within their grasp anymore.

15:44.900 --> 15:49.620
It doesn't feel that the story of progress that has written the story of this country

15:49.620 --> 15:56.580
from one generation to the next is actually working for them, because people aren't

15:56.580 --> 16:00.900
of the opinion that, you know, their kids are automatically, even however hard they

16:00.900 --> 16:04.980
work, going to be able to have a better quality of life or more opportunities than they did.

16:04.980 --> 16:08.020
There are real anxieties and doubts out there.

16:08.020 --> 16:13.960
And we're seeing that not just in Canada, but around the world, where people are fearful

16:13.960 --> 16:20.800
and they're, you know, leaning towards closing in, closing off, pointing fingers, laying

16:20.800 --> 16:21.800
blame.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.320
And we took a chance in the last election.

16:24.320 --> 16:27.360
We said, you know what, we think Canadians are better than that, and we're not going

16:27.360 --> 16:32.720
to play the politics of fear and division, and we're going to be upfront with Canadians.

16:32.720 --> 16:35.260
What we think we need is investment.

16:35.260 --> 16:37.240
We need to invest in public transit.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.400
We need to invest in social infrastructure.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.060
We need to invest in green infrastructure.

16:42.060 --> 16:49.100
We need to invest in our universities and colleges and research institutions.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.720
We need to invest in our young people.

16:51.720 --> 16:54.860
We need to invest in the middle class and those working hard to join.

16:54.860 --> 17:00.620
And the first thing we did was we lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them

17:00.620 --> 17:03.180
on the wealthiest 1%.

17:03.180 --> 17:10.220
And I'm making a jump here, Zach, but I assume that the people you voted for, the Conservatives,

17:10.220 --> 17:15.780
voted against that particular measure, to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1% and lower

17:15.780 --> 17:17.620
them on the middle class.

17:17.620 --> 17:25.100
And then, this past summer, we brought in the Canada Child Benefit, which helps nine

17:25.100 --> 17:31.460
out of ten families in this country with more money, tax-free, every month for the cost

17:31.460 --> 17:35.300
of groceries, school supplies, raising their kids.

17:35.300 --> 17:38.940
And the reason we can do that is we're giving more money to the people who need it, those

17:38.940 --> 17:43.400
in the middle class and those working hard to join it, by doing less for the wealthy

17:43.400 --> 17:48.020
families that received the child benefit under the previous government.

17:48.020 --> 17:55.060
These are decisions we made because we know that giving opportunities to everyone to succeed,

17:55.060 --> 18:00.220
that supporting the middle class and those working hard to join it, is the way we build

18:00.220 --> 18:01.620
the future.

18:01.620 --> 18:07.540
So when I talk to Canadians about being optimistic about our future, about investing in the kinds

18:07.540 --> 18:15.380
of things that we know are going to lead to good jobs for our kids and secure retirements

18:15.380 --> 18:20.980
for ourselves and our parents, that are going to lead to better investments in research

18:20.980 --> 18:26.360
and innovation, that are going to lead to solutions, better health care, better outcomes

18:26.360 --> 18:32.300
in education, these are the kinds of things that we talked about in the last election.

18:32.300 --> 18:38.060
And we in the Liberal Party and the Government of Canada have been consistent that our focus

18:38.060 --> 18:43.500
is in investing in ways to grow the middle class and help Canadians move forward, and

18:43.500 --> 18:45.080
I stand by that.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.380
Did you notice how much of a non-answer that was?

18:47.380 --> 18:50.980
Did you notice how hard Trudeau actually avoided answering the question?

18:50.980 --> 18:56.220
I mean, if we had to glean some kind of response from that spiel, it's, yes, I'm going to

18:56.220 --> 19:00.340
run up a massive deficit, but I'm going to use that money to reinvest in Canada.

19:00.340 --> 19:04.260
Which sounds good, until you realize that almost all of Justin's reinvestments have

19:04.260 --> 19:08.320
been completely neutered, and that the bills for them won't be coming in until long after

19:08.320 --> 19:09.660
Justin's left office.

19:09.660 --> 19:13.420
It's no surprise he doesn't have an answer, it's because he doesn't have to worry about

19:13.420 --> 19:14.420
the solution.

19:14.420 --> 19:18.400
Trudeau's support for environmentally friendly policies seem to have also been lip service

19:18.400 --> 19:19.400
as well.

19:19.400 --> 19:23.380
Despite promises to the contrary, fossil fuel subsidies remain in place for the next eight

19:23.380 --> 19:24.380
years.

19:24.380 --> 19:27.500
Alberta's oil sands continue to be exploited in a way that harms the environment, pipelines

19:27.500 --> 19:30.940
continue to be built in ways that disregard the owners and occupants of the land the pipeline

19:30.940 --> 19:31.940
sits on.

19:31.940 --> 19:36.660
Our government has been consistent from the very beginning, that Canadians need economic

19:36.660 --> 19:42.460
development while at the same time protecting the environment and the well-being of future

19:42.460 --> 19:43.460
generations.

19:43.460 --> 19:49.300
We need to make sure that the processes are folding in, community perspectives, partnerships

19:49.300 --> 19:55.860
with Indigenous peoples, the top-notch science and response concerns that people have.

19:55.860 --> 20:01.380
There isn't a country in the world that would find billions of barrels of oil and leave it

20:01.380 --> 20:03.780
in the ground while there is a market for it.

20:03.780 --> 20:07.700
And with these words, the Trudeau government approved the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain

20:07.700 --> 20:12.820
Project that runs from Alberta to Burnaby, British Columbia, a project that has sparked

20:12.820 --> 20:14.620
protests across the country.

20:14.620 --> 20:19.740
The government is also giving a green light to another project, the Line 3 pipeline expansion

20:19.740 --> 20:22.380
from Alberta to Wisconsin.

20:22.380 --> 20:25.520
Environmentalists wanted red lights on all projects.

20:25.520 --> 20:29.640
It's not a question of if there will be a spill, it's a question of when there will be a spill.

20:29.640 --> 20:34.040
Oh, and speaking of that, Justin, back before you got into politics, didn't you object

20:34.040 --> 20:37.680
to a zinc mine in the Northwest Territories that would have poisoned the Nahanni River,

20:37.680 --> 20:41.580
a World Heritage Site due to both its ecological importance and the native people who lived

20:41.580 --> 20:42.580
there for thousands of years?

20:42.580 --> 20:45.980
Do you still hold those views, considering you've broken your promise about the Site

20:45.980 --> 20:49.440
C Dam project, which would submerge native lands upon its completion?

20:49.440 --> 20:53.700
Oh, I guess it's okay, because you've also refused to ratify the UN's Declaration of

20:53.700 --> 20:57.560
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, even though that was another promise, with members of

20:57.560 --> 21:00.960
your cabinet going so far as to say it was unworkable as law.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.660
We can keep going if you like, there's broken promises here about military spending, about

21:04.660 --> 21:09.200
veterans affairs, about gun control, but let's get to the one that I think is the most important

21:09.200 --> 21:13.380
broken promise on this list, Trudeau's abandonment of electoral reform.

21:13.380 --> 21:17.460
Canada currently uses a first-past-the-post electoral system, whoever has the most votes

21:17.460 --> 21:18.460
wins the election.

21:18.460 --> 21:19.460
Simple, right?

21:19.460 --> 21:24.260
First-past-the-post voting generally trends towards party consolidation, and mega-parties

21:24.260 --> 21:25.380
become the norm.

21:25.380 --> 21:28.440
This happens because parties tend to not want to split the vote.

21:28.440 --> 21:33.440
For example, like in Canada during the 39th and 40th Parliaments, when you have one right-leaning

21:33.440 --> 21:37.800
party and two left-leaning parties, often the left-leaning voters will vote for either

21:37.800 --> 21:40.960
one or the other, splitting the vote between the two options.

21:40.960 --> 21:44.700
Tory politicians ended up walking away with seats even though their constituents largely

21:44.700 --> 21:48.300
disagreed with them, because the votes for either the Liberal or the NDP candidate weren't

21:48.300 --> 21:50.020
higher than the Conservative candidate.

21:50.020 --> 21:53.680
Even though the total number of votes for both of them was much higher, in first-past-the-post

21:53.680 --> 21:58.140
voting systems, larger parties tend to cannibalize smaller parties in an effort not to split

21:58.140 --> 21:59.140
votes.

21:59.140 --> 22:04.340
The US is the most extreme example of this, with politics dominated by two massive parties,

22:04.340 --> 22:08.220
while people desiring nuanced political positions are generally left out in the cold.

22:08.220 --> 22:11.540
Trudeau acknowledged that first-past-the-post voting helped destroy the Liberals in the

22:11.540 --> 22:15.900
past, and made it a core promise of his campaign to change Canada's electoral system.

22:15.900 --> 22:20.980
So I'm proposing we make every vote count.

22:20.980 --> 22:28.000
We are committed to ensuring that the 2015 election will be the last federal election

22:28.000 --> 22:29.940
using first-past-the-post.

22:29.940 --> 22:33.860
Even when first-past-the-post voting brought him into power, he reiterated that promise

22:33.860 --> 22:34.860
multiple times.

22:34.860 --> 22:38.700
And there are other voting systems that would work just fine in a political environment

22:38.700 --> 22:41.720
that has a polarity of different parties, like Canada's.

22:41.720 --> 22:46.000
But on February 1st, 2017, Trudeau walked back on this promise.

23:11.720 --> 23:14.720
The Right Honourable Prime Minister.

23:14.720 --> 23:19.960
Mr. Speaker, over the past year, we consulted with hundreds of thousands of Canadians to

23:19.960 --> 23:23.440
hear their views on transforming our electoral system.

23:23.440 --> 23:29.160
It's very clear, as people in this House know, I have long preferred a preferential

23:29.160 --> 23:30.160
ballot.

23:30.160 --> 23:35.340
The members opposite wanted a proportional representation.

23:35.340 --> 23:38.680
The official opposition wanted a referendum.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.160
There is no consensus.

23:40.160 --> 23:41.960
There is no clear path forward.

23:41.960 --> 23:48.440
It would be irresponsible for us to do something that harms Canada's stability when, in fact,

23:48.440 --> 23:54.160
what we need is moving forward on growth for the middle class and support.

23:54.160 --> 23:59.160
The Honourable Member for Outremont.

23:59.160 --> 24:03.120
The Prime Minister obviously never read the report, Mr. Speaker.

24:03.120 --> 24:08.080
My democracy charade didn't even ask Canadians if they wanted to change the voting system.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.080
But you know what?

24:09.080 --> 24:13.640
At almost every single one of the Prime Minister's town halls, someone asked him about democratic

24:13.640 --> 24:14.640
reform.

24:14.640 --> 24:19.860
So as the Prime Minister now fabricates evidence to claim Canadians didn't want what he got

24:19.860 --> 24:25.480
elected on, my question is, what expression from Canadians would have been sufficient

24:25.480 --> 24:29.400
to get the Prime Minister to respect his own promise?

24:29.400 --> 24:32.300
The Prime Minister made this promise hundreds of times during the election.

24:32.300 --> 24:34.040
He wrote it in his party's platform.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.640
He put it in his very first throne speech.

24:35.640 --> 24:36.640
You know what?

24:36.640 --> 24:40.120
Canadians trusted 1,813 times since they got elected.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.720
That's the real number, Mr. Speaker.

24:41.720 --> 24:47.680
How can Canadians trust anything this Prime Minister has to say after he has so blatantly

24:47.680 --> 24:51.640
and intentionally betrayed his own word?

24:51.640 --> 24:56.640
The Honourable Prime Minister.

24:56.640 --> 25:01.880
Mr. Speaker, we spent a year listening to Canadians, talking with them, hearing from

25:01.880 --> 25:06.800
a broad range of views, seeing the firmly held views that a number of people feel on

25:06.800 --> 25:12.580
that, and understanding that there is no clear path forward, there is no consensus, a referendum

25:12.580 --> 25:17.560
would be a bad idea, moving forward in a divisive policy would be a bad idea.

25:17.560 --> 25:22.280
The fact of the matter is, I am not going to do something that is wrong for Canadians

25:22.280 --> 25:25.120
just to tick off a box on an electoral platform.

25:25.120 --> 25:30.380
That's not the kind of Prime Minister I will be.

25:30.380 --> 25:34.340
In a letter Trudeau wrote to Karina Gould, the Minister of Democratic Institutions,

25:34.340 --> 25:35.340
he stated,

25:39.340 --> 25:43.580
Furthermore, without a clear preference or a clear question, a referendum would not be

25:43.580 --> 25:45.100
in Canada's interest.

25:45.100 --> 25:47.900
Changing the electoral system will not be in your mandate.

25:47.900 --> 25:51.780
Justin, changing the electoral system is in your mandate.

25:51.780 --> 25:53.020
It's what you ran on.

25:53.020 --> 25:54.580
It's why a lot of people voted for you.

25:54.580 --> 25:56.620
And it's what a lot of people expect you to do.

25:56.660 --> 26:00.660
In my opinion, this is one of the bigger issues, domestically, Canada needs to solve.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.600
A lot of other things stem from this.

26:02.600 --> 26:07.300
The economy, the refugee crisis, Canada's role overseas, healthcare, the environment,

26:07.300 --> 26:08.300
you name it.

26:08.300 --> 26:12.380
We're going to have a much harder time actually solving these issues, rather than simply bending

26:12.380 --> 26:16.300
to corporate interests or international interests, as long as a voting method that serves to

26:16.300 --> 26:18.380
polarize the political system exists.

26:18.380 --> 26:22.420
Props to the NDP's Nathan Cullen though, who went on TV to outright call Trudeau a

26:22.420 --> 26:23.420
liar and a coward.

26:23.740 --> 26:29.820
Let me start by saying I was a bit surprised that it wasn't Mr. Trudeau out here, somehow

26:29.820 --> 26:33.700
lacking the courage and fortitude to make this announcement himself.

26:33.700 --> 26:40.460
He certainly had no problems making the promise, but not yet the courage to break that promise

26:40.460 --> 26:42.540
in front of you all here today.

26:42.540 --> 26:48.340
That rather than keep his word to the millions of Canadians who voted for him and the hundreds

26:48.340 --> 26:54.220
of thousands of Canadians who engaged in good faith with Mr. Trudeau over this question

26:54.220 --> 27:02.140
of how to strengthen and broaden our democracy, Mr. Trudeau chose today instead to spit in

27:02.140 --> 27:03.660
their face.

27:03.660 --> 27:10.740
I want to choose my words very carefully, I know words matter, the words that we speak

27:10.740 --> 27:13.740
here and in Parliament matter.

27:13.740 --> 27:19.380
What Mr. Trudeau approved himself today was to be a liar, was to be of the most cynical

27:19.380 --> 27:26.960
variety of politician, saying whatever it takes to get elected, then once elected seeking

27:26.960 --> 27:36.180
any excuse, however weak, however absent, to justify that lie to Canadians.

27:36.180 --> 27:38.740
He promised to be different.

27:38.740 --> 27:45.660
He promised not to conduct himself this way, but to conduct himself with honour and integrity.

27:45.660 --> 27:51.260
I'm not sure the Liberals understand what the word respect means, because to have made

27:51.260 --> 27:57.620
such a black and white promise and then to feel so casual and cynical in breaking that

27:57.620 --> 28:04.540
promise, it puts into question any commitment, any promise Mr. Trudeau makes or has made

28:04.540 --> 28:07.380
in the past.

28:07.380 --> 28:12.900
The Liberals and Mr. Trudeau today made themselves the best argument of why we desperately need

28:12.900 --> 28:14.700
electoral reform.

28:14.700 --> 28:18.920
However not everything Trudeau said and done has been tracked by Trudeau-meter.

28:18.920 --> 28:23.660
One of the most important ones to me personally, Trudeau's stance on the TPP, he basically

28:23.660 --> 28:25.120
pulled Hillary Clinton on.

28:25.120 --> 28:29.920
Like Hillary, during the election he recognized that the TPP wasn't popular with the electorate,

28:29.920 --> 28:34.620
so like Hillary, he took a wait and see approach with the TPP, stating that he didn't really

28:34.620 --> 28:36.540
know if he supported it or not.

28:36.540 --> 28:39.780
We're always going to need to be engaged in international trade.

28:39.780 --> 28:44.540
It's what has helped Canada become the successful country that we are right now.

28:44.540 --> 28:48.780
We need to continue to do it and it's important that we get it right, which is why I'm going

28:48.780 --> 28:54.980
to take a very careful look at the provisions and listen to Canadians from across the country

28:54.980 --> 29:01.340
and have them get an opportunity to express their concerns in committees and before Parliament

29:01.340 --> 29:04.820
as we seek ratification of this deal.

29:04.820 --> 29:05.820
Is that a yes?

29:06.180 --> 29:11.900
That is, I look forward to seeing the details of the deal, but we go into it from a position

29:11.900 --> 29:16.780
of being resolutely and consistently, I might add, pro-trade.

29:16.780 --> 29:22.100
Again with the TPP, you've said that you want to look at the details of the deal before

29:22.100 --> 29:25.380
you make a call on it, but there are some details that are out this morning and I'm

29:25.380 --> 29:27.100
guessing you've had a look at them.

29:27.100 --> 29:30.820
Is there anything that you've seen so far that gives you pause, particularly with regard

29:30.820 --> 29:32.900
to the auto parts and dairy sectors?

29:32.900 --> 29:37.860
Obviously there have been a lot of questions about that and I look forward to hearing from

29:37.860 --> 29:45.340
representatives of those industries, from concerned Canadians, from labour, from manufacturers

29:45.340 --> 29:50.660
about the impacts and the challenges of this particular deal, which is why I am committed

29:50.660 --> 29:56.500
to a full and open discussion in the House of Commons, a debate on this, and if I become

29:56.500 --> 30:03.460
Prime Minister and earned your trust on October 19th, we will ratify this properly in the

30:03.460 --> 30:07.300
House of Commons after a fulsome and responsible discussion.

30:07.300 --> 30:11.180
And 12 days after the Canadian election, in a call to the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo

30:11.180 --> 30:15.020
Abe, Trudeau reiterated his government's support for the TPP, just like Hillary would

30:15.020 --> 30:16.700
have done had she been elected.

30:16.700 --> 30:20.060
This is how we know for a fact that Justin Trudeau is a miracle worker.

30:20.060 --> 30:23.860
He was able to get all of those opinions from average Canadians, as well as have a rigorous

30:23.860 --> 30:27.580
debate about the topic in the House of Commons, all in just 12 days.

30:27.580 --> 30:31.500
Did you see that it was good and rest on the 13th day too, Justin?

30:31.500 --> 30:33.420
And then there's Motion 103.

30:33.420 --> 30:37.940
M103 gained international attention, something that Canadian politics rarely does, because

30:37.940 --> 30:42.140
in an era of migrants flowing into Europe unchecked, of Donald Trump's Great Wall

30:42.140 --> 30:47.600
of America, of ISIS and Islamic attacks in France and Germany and Sweden, Canada decided

30:47.600 --> 30:52.100
to ratify a motion condemning Islamophobia, presumably in response to the Quebec Mosque

30:52.100 --> 30:53.100
shooting.

30:53.340 --> 30:56.780
When the motion was first tabled before that attack, support for it only began to surge

30:56.780 --> 30:57.780
in the House afterward.

30:57.780 --> 31:02.140
There's been a few misconceptions about M103, it's not a bill or a law, it hasn't

31:02.140 --> 31:04.940
become illegal to be Islamophobic in Canada or anything.

31:04.940 --> 31:08.740
Rather, it is a motion, which is basically a suggestion that the government look into

31:08.740 --> 31:12.580
a particular topic, do some research, and get back to parliament with their results

31:12.580 --> 31:13.580
somewhere down the road.

31:13.580 --> 31:16.620
Let's read M103 in its entirety, it's not very long.

31:16.620 --> 31:19.140
That, in the opinion of the House, the government should

31:19.140 --> 31:23.740
A. Recognize the need to quell the increasing public climate of hate and fear

31:23.740 --> 31:29.220
B. Condemn Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination

31:29.220 --> 31:33.960
and take note of the House of Commons petition E411 and the issues raised by it

31:33.960 --> 31:37.980
and C. Request that the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage undertake a study on

31:37.980 --> 31:38.980
how the government could

31:38.980 --> 31:44.420
1. Develop a whole-of-government approach to reducing or eliminating systemic racism

31:44.420 --> 31:46.620
and religious discrimination, including Islamophobia

31:46.620 --> 31:51.260
2. In Canada, while ensuring a community-centered focus with a holistic response through evidence-based

31:51.260 --> 31:52.600
policymaking, and

31:52.600 --> 31:57.180
3. Collect data to contextualize hate crime reports and to conduct needs assessments for

31:57.180 --> 31:58.580
impacted communities, and

31:58.580 --> 32:02.020
4. That the committee should present its findings and recommendations to the House of Commons

32:02.020 --> 32:06.980
no later than 240 calendar days from the adoption of this motion, provided that in its report,

32:06.980 --> 32:10.740
the committee should make recommendations that the government may use to better reflect

32:10.740 --> 32:14.920
the enshrined rights and freedoms in the Constitution Acts, including the Canadian Charter of Rights

32:14.920 --> 32:15.920
and Freedoms.

32:15.920 --> 32:20.840
This basically says, we think that Canadian culture and Canadian citizens have an Islamophobia

32:20.840 --> 32:23.920
problem, and we need to stop it. Let's look into how.

32:23.920 --> 32:27.920
It doesn't define Islamophobia for the purposes of the motion, casting an incredibly wide

32:27.920 --> 32:28.920
net.

32:28.920 --> 32:33.840
Criticism of Islam as a religion can be considered Islamophobic.

32:33.840 --> 32:38.240
Criticism of Sharia law as a political framework can also be considered Islamophobic.

32:38.240 --> 32:43.680
Let me repeat, some definitions of Islamophobia consider the statement, I am not a Muslim

32:43.680 --> 32:48.700
and I don't want Sharia law to be the law of the land, to be Islamophobic, and this

32:48.700 --> 32:51.460
motion may also consider that statement to be hateful.

32:51.460 --> 32:55.680
This motion also singles Islam out for special consideration, though it does give lip service

32:55.680 --> 32:58.960
to other forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination.

32:58.960 --> 33:04.140
Irka Khalid, the motion's author, was unwilling to entertain any compromise on the specific

33:04.140 --> 33:05.420
wording of the motion.

33:05.420 --> 33:10.220
A counter-motion, tabled by the Tories, did not specifically mention Islamophobia, instead

33:10.220 --> 33:14.260
condemning all forms of systemic racism, religious intolerance, and discrimination

33:14.260 --> 33:18.300
of Muslims, Jews, Christians, Sikhs, Hindus, and other religious communities.

33:18.300 --> 33:23.460
This motion was defeated, with the Conservatives, the Bloc, the NDP, and the Greens all voting

33:23.460 --> 33:27.020
for it, and the Liberals near-anonymously voting against it.

33:27.020 --> 33:30.940
These facts, combined with the House of Commons' history of passing similar motions for Jews

33:30.940 --> 33:37.580
and Yazidis in 2016, and Coptic Christians in 2011, makes me think that M103 is liberal

33:37.580 --> 33:38.580
grandstanding.

33:38.580 --> 33:42.620
Khalid's efforts may come from a genuine concern for Canada's Muslim community.

33:42.620 --> 33:46.820
She is a Muslim herself, though clearly a liberal one, but she's also a politician

33:46.820 --> 33:48.380
riding a liberal wave.

33:48.380 --> 33:52.580
M103 is a way of building up her own brand within the Liberal Party, and a way for the

33:52.580 --> 33:56.380
Liberal Party to champion a new rising star with a proper demographic appeal.

33:56.380 --> 34:00.540
If this wasn't simply Khalid grandstanding with liberal backing, the Tory motion that

34:00.540 --> 34:04.280
did almost exactly the same thing wouldn't have been universally opposed.

34:04.280 --> 34:09.520
My concern, however, is with what happens in 240 days, after whatever committee returns

34:09.520 --> 34:11.640
to parliament with its findings on M103.

34:11.640 --> 34:15.840
M103 does not restrict free speech, but the steps beyond that might.

34:15.840 --> 34:20.440
It may not currently be considered hateful to be a critic of Islam's treatment of women,

34:20.440 --> 34:24.640
its politically expansionist rhetoric, or its penchant for terror attacks, but it might

34:24.640 --> 34:26.120
be in the future.

34:26.120 --> 34:27.560
And that's what scares me.

34:27.560 --> 34:32.080
M103's findings may lead to a future where it is considered, for example, a hate crime

34:32.080 --> 34:37.080
to object to female genital mutilation, as it's considered a cultural practice by Muslims.

34:37.080 --> 34:39.960
But what does Trudeau himself think about all of this?

34:39.960 --> 34:44.800
Well, during International Woman's Day 2017, the House of Commons held a mock session of

34:44.800 --> 34:49.280
parliament comprising entirely of young female students, which Trudeau was present for.

34:49.280 --> 34:52.080
During this event, he answered a question regarding Islamophobia.

34:52.080 --> 34:53.080
Let's listen in.

34:53.080 --> 35:02.200
With Islamophobia, we have been seeing over the past while a rise in expressions of hate

35:02.200 --> 35:05.240
and in hate crimes across the country.

35:05.240 --> 35:10.600
Yesterday, we had an attack on a mosque in Calgary, but we also had attacks on the Jewish

35:10.600 --> 35:12.720
community and the GTA.

35:12.720 --> 35:23.560
We have examples of racism, intolerance, and hatred spiking up all across the country over

35:23.560 --> 35:26.760
the past… past… past months.

35:26.760 --> 35:32.520
Obviously, the terrible terrorist attack in Quebec City was an example of it, was a particularly

35:32.520 --> 35:37.700
brutal example of it, but we have an awful lot more to do.

35:37.820 --> 35:45.780
I may reassure you to know that last fall, this House unanimously, every member in this

35:45.780 --> 35:51.780
House approved of a motion condemning Islamophobia.

35:51.780 --> 35:55.660
It was unanimously approved.

35:55.660 --> 35:57.800
That was a good measure.

35:57.800 --> 36:00.700
It was a moment where everyone came together and agreed.

36:00.700 --> 36:06.300
It was a motion by Mr. Mulcair, and we were glad to have this House condemn Islamophobia.

36:06.300 --> 36:17.180
More recently, when a motion came forward to not just condemn Islamophobia, but to ask

36:17.180 --> 36:24.720
the House of Commons committee to study it, to get into the issues around it and to see

36:24.720 --> 36:30.540
what we can do in a very open way about moving forward on something that is unfortunately

36:30.540 --> 36:33.940
increasing in terms of intolerance.

36:33.980 --> 36:38.380
That has created a bit of… a bit of a debate.

36:38.380 --> 36:44.420
And on one hand, I'd like to think that, you know, everyone can all get up and always

36:44.420 --> 36:48.900
condemn things that are bad and move on.

36:48.900 --> 36:57.700
But on the other hand, sometimes it's useful for people to stand up and disagree, to point

36:57.700 --> 37:01.660
out to the rest of us that there's still a lot of work to do.

37:01.660 --> 37:06.260
If everyone had just agreed and we'd moved on, maybe we wouldn't be addressing the

37:06.260 --> 37:12.620
very scary and real spike in hate speech.

37:12.620 --> 37:17.900
Maybe we wouldn't be challenging each other as politicians in the things that we're

37:17.900 --> 37:28.300
saying, in the choices we make as leaders to play up divisions and fears.

37:29.300 --> 37:33.700
It's easy to try and scare people into voting for you.

37:33.700 --> 37:38.260
It's easy to try and say something that's going to pit a neighbour against a neighbour.

37:38.260 --> 37:42.820
If you do it in a sneaky way and use coded language, maybe you won't get called on

37:42.820 --> 37:45.100
it by the majority.

37:45.100 --> 37:48.900
Maybe you'll get to slip it through.

37:48.900 --> 38:00.620
Well if M103, condemning Islamophobia, actually gets people to notice that there are people

38:00.620 --> 38:08.140
uncomfortable with that idea, that there are people who still have problems with the idea

38:08.140 --> 38:13.860
that we would condemn discrimination against Muslims, then we have to know.

38:13.860 --> 38:17.820
We have to expose that and we have to deal with it as a society.

38:17.820 --> 38:23.380
Because if this room isn't a reflection of what's happening in our streets, in our

38:23.380 --> 38:28.700
towns, in our communities, then we're not dealing with the real things that Canadians

38:28.700 --> 38:31.460
expect us to deal with.

38:31.460 --> 38:34.660
So do we have a problem with Islamophobia in this country?

38:34.660 --> 38:36.700
Yes we do.

38:36.700 --> 38:41.060
Do we have a problem with anti-Semitism in this country?

38:41.060 --> 38:42.060
Yes we do.

38:42.060 --> 38:45.540
Do we have a problem in this country with discrimination and hatred?

38:45.580 --> 38:48.260
Yes we do.

38:48.260 --> 38:54.900
And we need to talk about this and we need to challenge each other to be better on this.

38:54.900 --> 38:59.260
We need to recognize that we still have a problem because there are men out there who

38:59.260 --> 39:03.700
will not say, yes I am a feminist.

39:03.700 --> 39:11.140
We need to recognize that saying and bringing forward truths that are uncomfortable to some

39:11.140 --> 39:16.980
and challenge each other to shift our ways of thinking out of the easy ways we do.

39:16.980 --> 39:22.940
To lay open wounds to sunshine and disinfectant.

39:22.940 --> 39:29.940
That is also the role that we have in this house and that we have as active, engaged

39:29.940 --> 39:32.140
citizens in this country.

39:32.140 --> 39:34.620
We need to speak up.

39:34.620 --> 39:42.980
The silent majority of good people in Canada who are not intolerant, who are not bigoted,

39:42.980 --> 39:47.100
need to know they can be less silent.

39:47.100 --> 39:51.540
We need to speak up for the things we believe in.

39:51.540 --> 39:56.940
This house and every house across this country needs to be a reflection of that.

39:56.940 --> 39:58.540
There are obvious problems here.

39:58.540 --> 40:03.760
First, Trudeau makes the classic SJW mistake in conflating hate crimes with hate speech

40:03.760 --> 40:06.360
or hateful thoughts or expressions of hate.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.100
And no, they're not the same thing.

40:08.100 --> 40:10.080
Words can never be violence.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.660
Calling a black man a nigger is not violence.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.320
It might make you a racist asshole.

40:14.320 --> 40:18.280
It might make you somebody that I would never ever want to associate with, do business with

40:18.280 --> 40:19.600
or whatever.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.420
But it is not violent.

40:21.420 --> 40:23.600
It's not the same as attacking a black man.

40:23.600 --> 40:27.240
Not using a trans person's preferred pronouns is not a violent act.

40:27.240 --> 40:31.520
Not liking Islam as a religion or a political philosophy is not a violent act.

40:31.520 --> 40:35.200
You can't lump in all the hateful comments, all the racial slurs and whatever with the

40:35.200 --> 40:39.600
number of actual attacks and claim, oh, Canada is so violent towards Muslims.

40:39.600 --> 40:40.960
That's not how it works.

40:40.960 --> 40:44.600
Secondly, Trudeau is right in labeling the Quebec mosque shooting a terrorist attack.

40:44.600 --> 40:49.000
It didn't use explosives or airplanes, but it was a mass murder designed not only to

40:49.000 --> 40:52.320
kill but to inspire terror within the affected communities.

40:52.320 --> 40:57.080
And preventing these attacks, responding to these attacks, helping victims of these attacks

40:57.080 --> 41:01.040
and seeing the perpetrators of these attacks brought to justice is absolutely the government's

41:01.040 --> 41:02.040
job.

41:02.040 --> 41:04.680
It is not the government's job to police the population for thought crime.

41:04.680 --> 41:08.680
In conflating rhetoric with violence, Trudeau has taken on a task that will never, ever

41:08.680 --> 41:10.080
be completed.

41:10.080 --> 41:14.960
The government cannot wipe out racist ideas or attitudes or even speech within the population.

41:14.960 --> 41:18.860
It can massively curtail human rights in order to get rid of some of it, sure.

41:18.860 --> 41:21.360
But how far do you go before you consider the job done?

41:21.360 --> 41:26.700
If your criteria, Justin, is to wipe out not only hateful actions, not only hateful speech,

41:26.700 --> 41:30.680
but hateful attitudes and ideas, the job will never ever be done.

41:30.680 --> 41:34.040
Even if there's not a shred of evidence that any hate exists.

41:34.040 --> 41:37.820
This is the path to totalitarianism, and it's a far cry from what Trudeau used to say about

41:37.820 --> 42:01.840
Stephen Harper's conduct as Prime Minister back in the day, too.

42:01.840 --> 42:04.960
recently departed Sun News Network.

42:04.960 --> 42:11.120
Their instincts are now to be suspicious of people who do not share their beliefs.

42:11.120 --> 42:16.280
To harden divisions with people whose views differ from their own.

42:16.280 --> 42:21.260
In my seven years in Parliament, I have heard the Conservative Prime Minister accuse two

42:21.260 --> 42:26.520
different leaders of the NDP of sympathizing with terrorists.

42:26.520 --> 42:33.560
The Conservative Party of Canada accuse notable Magillian Irwin-Kotler of anti-Semitism.

42:33.560 --> 42:38.560
And the former Public Safety Minister to declare, you're either with us or you're with the

42:38.560 --> 42:41.280
child pornographers.

42:41.280 --> 42:46.600
For that particular effort, the Prime Minister eventually rewarded him with a judicial appointment.

42:46.600 --> 42:52.760
This, my friends, is not your parents' Conservative Party.

42:52.760 --> 42:59.680
Their approach to politics might work in the short term, but it is corrosive over time.

42:59.680 --> 43:04.000
Especially in a diverse country like Canada.

43:04.000 --> 43:08.440
It stokes anxiety and ferments fear.

43:08.440 --> 43:13.800
Instead of encouraging Canadians to fight for one another's liberty, it tells us to

43:13.800 --> 43:18.080
be suspicious of each other's choices.

43:18.120 --> 43:23.160
Mr. Harper and I disagree fundamentally about a great many things.

43:23.160 --> 43:27.560
But none, perhaps more so than this.

43:27.560 --> 43:32.640
Leading this country should mean you bring Canadians together.

43:32.640 --> 43:36.120
You do not divide them against one another.

43:36.120 --> 43:45.880
Fear is a dangerous thing.

43:45.880 --> 43:51.600
Once it is sanctioned by the state, there is no telling where it might lead.

43:51.600 --> 43:58.000
It is always a short path to walk from being suspicious of our fellow citizens to taking

43:58.000 --> 44:01.240
actions to restrict their liberty.

44:01.240 --> 44:05.400
It's like I said at the beginning, candidate Trudeau is not the same man as Prime Minister

44:05.400 --> 44:06.400
Trudeau.

44:06.400 --> 44:07.400
Candidate Trudeau said,

44:07.400 --> 44:10.920
Fear is a dangerous thing.

44:10.920 --> 44:16.640
Once it is sanctioned by the state, there is no telling where it might lead.

44:16.640 --> 44:23.060
It is always a short path to walk from being suspicious of our fellow citizens to taking

44:23.060 --> 44:26.120
actions to restrict their liberty.

44:26.120 --> 44:27.760
While Prime Minister Trudeau said,

44:27.760 --> 44:38.720
M103 condemning Islamophobia actually gets people to notice that there are people uncomfortable

44:38.720 --> 44:45.560
with that idea, that there are people who still have problems with the idea that we

44:45.560 --> 44:51.040
would condemn discrimination against Muslims, then we have to know.

44:51.040 --> 44:54.720
We have to expose that and we have to deal with it as a society.

44:54.720 --> 44:58.760
Thirdly, this position of Trudeau's really makes his fervent claim of being a feminist

44:58.760 --> 44:59.960
ring hollow, doesn't it?

44:59.960 --> 45:03.480
I mean, Trudeau has no problem with shoehorning that shit in whenever he can.

45:03.480 --> 45:06.960
Bringing up Gamergate like Zoe Quinn was an absolute angel.

45:06.960 --> 45:10.000
My mom raised me to be a feminist.

45:10.000 --> 45:15.440
My father raised me, he was of a different generation, but he raised me to respect and

45:15.440 --> 45:18.160
defend everyone's rights.

45:18.160 --> 45:27.400
And I deeply grounded my own identity in that, and I'm proud to say I'm a feminist.

45:27.400 --> 45:33.840
And the things that we see online, whether it's issues like Gamergate and video games

45:33.840 --> 45:39.960
and misogyny in popular culture, is something that we need people to stand clearly against.

45:39.960 --> 45:42.000
Or while at a visit to the UN as well.

45:42.000 --> 45:50.920
First of all, I'm going to keep saying loud and clearly that I am a feminist until, hear

45:50.920 --> 45:55.520
me roar, until it is met with a shrug.

45:55.520 --> 45:57.520
Or how about the world economic form?

45:57.520 --> 46:00.880
Surely there's nothing else worth talking about there other than feminism, right?

46:00.880 --> 46:03.760
By the way, we shouldn't be afraid of the word feminist.

46:03.760 --> 46:08.160
Men and women should use it to describe themselves anytime they want.

46:08.160 --> 46:11.440
But Trudeau has been caught out multiple times for placing Muslims on a higher tier than

46:11.440 --> 46:13.080
women on the progressive stack.

46:13.080 --> 46:16.440
For example, before he became prime minister, the Tory government decided to put forward

46:16.440 --> 46:21.680
a motion condemning female genital mutilation, honour killings, and forced marriage as barbaric.

46:21.680 --> 46:25.320
And Justin Trudeau objected on the grounds that using the word barbaric to describe other

46:25.320 --> 46:26.960
cultures was racist.

46:26.960 --> 46:30.720
He later apologized, presumably because at this point he had little political power,

46:30.720 --> 46:33.320
but I don't think his opinions actually changed too much.

46:33.320 --> 46:34.320
Why?

46:34.320 --> 46:38.440
Because Trudeau, as prime minister, has had no problem attending events at Canadian mosques

46:38.440 --> 46:42.040
where the non-Muslim women who were with him were forced to wear headscarves, enter

46:42.040 --> 47:02.800
and leave through side doors, and sit on isolated balconies or off to the side away from men.

47:02.800 --> 47:07.120
When you're a social justice warrior or a regressive leftist, a minority religion practiced

47:07.120 --> 47:11.720
primarily by racially minority individuals on the one hand, and feminism and women's

47:11.720 --> 47:15.120
rights on the other hand, which one do you ultimately choose?

47:15.120 --> 47:19.760
Well, look at the face of Ontario's Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne, and you get your answer.

47:19.760 --> 47:23.840
And although I don't really like the Canadian-based right-leaning news outlet The Rebel, they

47:23.840 --> 47:27.420
were still the only ones actually willing to hold Trudeau's feet to the fire on this

47:27.420 --> 47:28.420
issue.

47:28.420 --> 47:32.000
Prime Minister, it's about the event you attended yesterday in the morning, and some

47:32.000 --> 47:36.760
progressive, what I guess I would call progressive feminists, who very much support your work

47:36.760 --> 47:41.280
for gender equality and very admiring of that work, were disappointed that you attended

47:41.280 --> 47:43.360
a gender-segregated event.

47:43.360 --> 47:48.120
And so I guess my question would be, how do you reconcile your brand as a self-styled

47:48.120 --> 47:53.440
feminist prime minister with attendance at a gender-segregated event?

47:53.440 --> 47:55.620
Look at the balls on this guy.

47:55.620 --> 47:58.940
Are any left-leaning news organizations going to stand up here?

47:58.940 --> 48:01.040
Any feminist academics or writers?

48:01.040 --> 48:02.040
Any at all?

48:02.040 --> 48:05.520
Is it going to yet again be the job of the Conservatives to make a principled stand for

48:05.520 --> 48:08.680
women's rights, gay rights, human rights against Islam?

48:08.680 --> 48:11.260
Just like in the US, the UK, France, and elsewhere?

48:11.260 --> 48:15.120
Are there any liberal politicians left in the fucking world willing to look beyond somebody's

48:15.120 --> 48:19.740
race or religion or gender and say, your human rights abuses are unacceptable, and your culture,

48:19.740 --> 48:23.120
your religion, and your ideology don't excuse that fact?

48:23.120 --> 48:32.120
The fact is, the values that define Canada include respect and openness towards our full

48:32.120 --> 48:33.120
diversity.

48:33.720 --> 48:37.800
Understanding that diversity is a source of strength, not a source of weakness, is why

48:37.800 --> 48:44.280
I think that politicians need to be focused on bringing people together rather than fomenting

48:44.280 --> 48:45.280
divisions.

48:45.280 --> 48:51.720
And that's why I am happy to attend community events in churches, temples, synagogues, mosques.

48:51.720 --> 48:58.360
I'm happy to engage with Canadians where they are and talk about the full range of

48:58.360 --> 49:01.800
opportunities that we're working hard to create.

49:01.800 --> 49:11.840
Yeah, yeah, Justin, you're not on the campaign trail anymore.

49:11.840 --> 49:15.640
Robotically regurgitating talking points like Marco Rubio's assertion that Barack Obama

49:15.640 --> 49:20.440
knows exactly what he's doing does not answer the fucking question.

49:20.440 --> 49:23.160
I'm somebody who has never voted Conservative in my life.

49:23.160 --> 49:27.400
And I grew up with the general idea, as did many others my age, that the Liberals and

49:27.400 --> 49:32.240
the NDP generally had the backs of average Canadians on social issues, even if they were

49:32.240 --> 49:34.080
hit and miss economically.

49:34.080 --> 49:38.600
This was something I actually discussed with ScrumpMonkey, or El Scrumpo on Twitter, on

49:38.600 --> 49:42.880
a call recently, and that discussion helped me form a hypothesis regarding liberal abandonment

49:42.880 --> 49:45.340
of the left, in both Canada and elsewhere.

49:45.340 --> 49:49.000
When I first became politically knowledgeable on even the most basic level, I was about

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
eight years old.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.880
Yes, I am the predecessor to the woke eight-year-old.

49:52.880 --> 49:53.880
Though not really.

49:53.880 --> 49:57.680
At that time, I knew who the Prime Minister of Canada was, Jean Chretien.

49:57.680 --> 50:00.560
I knew that he led the Liberal Party, and I knew that the Conservative Party was in

50:00.560 --> 50:01.560
opposition to him.

50:01.560 --> 50:04.800
I knew that he had a stroke that caused one side of his face to droop, and I knew that

50:04.800 --> 50:08.000
he made light of it by saying that he didn't talk out of both sides of his mouth.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.840
And as I grew older, my knowledge of politics also naturally grew.

50:11.840 --> 50:15.320
In high school, I remember holding the opinion that gay marriage should be legal.

50:15.320 --> 50:18.480
And I remember being considered a radical at that time for that position.

50:18.480 --> 50:22.520
I remember the fervor when gay marriage did actually become legal in 2003.

50:22.520 --> 50:26.840
And in that call with Scrump, we sat down and did a very brief look over at the major

50:26.840 --> 50:29.440
notable achievements of Prime Ministers of my time.

50:29.440 --> 50:30.880
Mulroney, Conservative.

50:30.880 --> 50:33.160
Privatization of several Crown Corporations.

50:33.160 --> 50:34.240
NAFTA.

50:34.240 --> 50:35.560
Support in the First Gulf War.

50:35.560 --> 50:37.140
Campbell, Conservative.

50:37.140 --> 50:38.640
First female Prime Minister.

50:38.640 --> 50:42.720
Mulroney bailed out of the party when he became unpopular, dumping all the problems on her.

50:42.720 --> 50:44.720
She only held the office for three months.

50:44.720 --> 50:46.120
Chretien, Liberal.

50:46.120 --> 50:47.120
Quebec Referendum.

50:47.120 --> 50:48.120
Kyoto Protocol.

50:48.120 --> 50:49.720
Invasion of Afghanistan.

50:49.720 --> 50:51.160
Opposition to the Second Iraq War.

50:51.160 --> 50:52.440
Martin, Liberal.

50:52.440 --> 50:53.560
Civil Marriage Act.

50:53.560 --> 50:55.280
Rejection of American Missile Treaty.

50:55.280 --> 50:56.840
Joining the G20?

50:56.840 --> 50:58.120
Liberal corruption scandals.

50:58.120 --> 50:59.760
Harper, Conservative.

50:59.760 --> 51:02.640
Hollowing out of Canada's softwood lumber industry.

51:02.640 --> 51:04.600
Apologies for residential schools.

51:04.600 --> 51:06.560
2008 Great Recession.

51:06.560 --> 51:08.480
Multiple uses of prorogation.

51:08.480 --> 51:09.680
Parliamentary contempt.

51:09.680 --> 51:11.320
Withdrawal from Kyoto.

51:11.320 --> 51:14.360
Crackdown on unions, human rights, and freedom of expression.

51:14.360 --> 51:15.920
Trudeau, Liberal.

51:15.920 --> 51:17.320
His father's good name.

51:17.320 --> 51:21.600
Though both Liberal and Tory Prime Ministers have had both good and bad accomplishments,

51:21.600 --> 51:25.440
at a cursory glance, it seems like the Liberals have done more good and the Tories have done

51:25.440 --> 51:26.440
more bad.

51:26.440 --> 51:29.400
The Liberals have acted more in accordance with civil liberties and the Tories have acted

51:29.400 --> 51:31.360
more in accordance with corporate interests.

51:31.360 --> 51:35.440
But America's third way corporatist democratic policies have come to Canada, full swing,

51:35.440 --> 51:36.560
with Justin Trudeau.

51:36.560 --> 51:40.020
And for a lot of young Liberals, hell, for a lot of middle-aged Liberals who are looking

51:40.020 --> 51:43.920
for a left-leaning party willing to take a stand against human rights abuses, even if

51:43.920 --> 51:48.160
those abuses come from racial or religious minorities, they are no longer seeing any

51:48.160 --> 51:50.160
champions within the Liberal Party.

51:50.160 --> 51:54.600
That said, Trudeau is content to call you a racist, a sexist, and an Islamophobe, all

51:54.600 --> 51:58.680
the while pursuing economic policies ranging between dysfunctional to corporatists, with

51:58.680 --> 52:00.980
no room for the Canadian citizen in between.

52:00.980 --> 52:04.420
This is the reason why Liberals are abandoning left-leaning parties in the UK.

52:04.420 --> 52:07.480
This is the reason why Liberals abandon Hillary in the US.

52:07.480 --> 52:11.600
And in my opinion, if an election were called today, this is the reason why Trudeau's

52:11.600 --> 52:13.880
Liberal Party would find itself in serious trouble.

52:13.880 --> 52:18.880
And it's also why the radical left protest group, Antifa, spray-paints Liberals get the

52:18.880 --> 52:19.880
bullet too.

52:19.880 --> 52:20.960
It's not racism.

52:20.960 --> 52:22.180
It's not sexism.

52:22.180 --> 52:23.600
It's not Islamophobia.

52:23.600 --> 52:24.880
It's not homophobia.

52:24.880 --> 52:28.880
It's because curtailing personal freedom and liberty is explicitly what liberalism fights

52:28.880 --> 52:33.340
against, even when Canada's quote-unquote Liberal Party wants to do it.

52:33.340 --> 52:38.480
As for Trudeau himself, I think the pressure of his father's legacy, plus finally managing

52:38.480 --> 52:43.060
to grasp real power, has fundamentally changed the man into somebody his younger self would

52:43.060 --> 52:44.360
have found bitter disappointment in.

52:44.360 --> 53:02.360
I

53:02.360 --> 53:06.960
know he was only 18 here, but this Trudeau is somebody willing to say something unpopular

53:06.960 --> 53:08.200
because he thought it was right.

53:08.200 --> 53:12.680
He was fighting against a Quebec independence referendum, a very popular independence referendum,

53:12.680 --> 53:13.680
while living in Montreal.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.440
Maybe this is an instance where he didn't completely get wiser as he got older.

53:17.440 --> 53:20.800
Trudeau also once said that he found the large numbers of people turning to him for potential

53:20.800 --> 53:24.080
party leadership solely because of his family name to be unsettling.

53:24.080 --> 53:25.080
What happened to that Trudeau?

53:25.080 --> 53:26.180
Where did he go?

53:26.180 --> 53:28.200
He once completely rejected identity politics.

53:28.200 --> 53:34.380
I'll make the case that Canadian liberty has got one of the world's most vexatious

53:34.380 --> 53:36.060
problems right.

53:36.060 --> 53:42.420
The interplay between individual freedom and collective identity.

53:42.420 --> 53:47.960
We understand that people are defined both by the things that unite us and distinguish

53:47.960 --> 53:57.340
us from one another, languages, cultures, faiths, even, importantly, gender and sexual

53:57.340 --> 53:58.900
orientation.

53:58.900 --> 54:07.420
However, we also know that all of these contribute to a person's identity but don't define

54:07.420 --> 54:08.840
it.

54:08.840 --> 54:15.040
These things all find their highest, most concrete expression in the individual human

54:15.040 --> 54:17.560
beings who embody them.

54:17.560 --> 54:19.040
What happened to that Trudeau?

54:19.040 --> 54:22.360
What happened to the Trudeau that would have been horrified at praising Fidel Castro upon

54:22.360 --> 54:23.600
the dictator's death?

54:23.600 --> 54:25.640
What happened to the Trudeau that said this?

54:25.640 --> 54:28.120
Our politics are supposed to be retail these days.

54:28.120 --> 54:35.560
We're expected to talk about very specific measures targeted at key audiences and swing

54:35.560 --> 54:41.400
voters, especially in an election year.

54:41.400 --> 54:43.720
But I have an old-fashioned view.

54:43.720 --> 54:50.080
I think policies are concrete expressions of values.

54:50.080 --> 54:54.920
Priorities are important.

54:54.920 --> 54:57.840
Specific commitments are important.

54:57.840 --> 55:02.200
But there is no way to predict the events you will have to navigate during your time

55:02.200 --> 55:08.440
in office, let alone the measures that will be required to manage those events.

55:08.440 --> 55:11.260
People aren't naive, they know that.
