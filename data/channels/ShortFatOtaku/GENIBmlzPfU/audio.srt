1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Oh Justin Trudeau, a lot of Canadians had high hopes for you.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,560
I know I didn't, which is why I didn't vote for you.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,360
But a lot of people did, and most of them are just now beginning to realize exactly

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,080
what kind of man they voted for.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,040
Trudeau's gotten a lot of online international attention recently, due to Motion 103, which

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,440
I'll discuss a little bit later.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,400
But as a Canadian myself, I think it's important to talk about a lot of the other things, the

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,200
domestic stuff that might not make it into the news in the US or UK.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,560
And yes, I do think it's important for people in the US or the UK to know what's going on

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,560
in Canada.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,120
I know we're just Canada guys.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,720
But we're still a large world economy, a middle power militarily, and most importantly, Justin

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,120
Trudeau is a canary in the coal mine for the rest of you, regarding what happens when a

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,120
hard left candidate not only takes office, but with a decisive majority in a modern first

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,120
world country.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,040
For those of you not in the know, Justin Trudeau is sort of like our Obama, minus the opposition

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,160
obstructionism as well as Obama's public speaking ability.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,920
You'll be running against Stephen Harper in the next election.

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:10,480
I think so I've, you know, we, you know what, I'll let I'll let the conservatives figure

20
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,480
that one out.

21
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,080
Their campaigns were run remarkably similar in that they both emphasize their candidates

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,440
youth as a way to show that they were more connected and knowledgeable but the problems

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,960
a modern nation faces.

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,700
They also both abandoned that rhetoric after taking office, instead opting to pursue corporate

25
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,200
left interests.

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,380
But to really get into the trouble with Justin Trudeau, we have to go back, way back.

27
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,700
All the way back to Justin's father, the 15th Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Trudeau.

28
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,340
A quick note here before we begin, I'm about to provide a lot of Canadian political history,

29
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,160
as I suspect most viewers of this video won't be Canadian and won't know about the political

30
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,800
climate that allowed Justin Trudeau to become Prime Minister.

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,640
I think it's important to describe the way the stage was set before Trudeau's arrival,

32
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,260
but if you're just not interested in that, you can jump ahead to the time shown here

33
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,020
where I'll get into the meat of Justin Trudeau's actions.

34
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,460
I warn you though, without the proper context, they may not make as much sense.

35
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,000
Pierre Trudeau was one of Canada's most popular and longest serving Prime Ministers

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
in history.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,220
The large amount of public infatuation with him was nicknamed Trudeau-mania by the media

38
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,620
at the time, a label that very briefly came back into public use to describe Justin during

39
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,620
his own campaign.

40
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,540
Trudeau spent his youth as what we would call today a proto-SJW, interested in topics such

41
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,220
as Marxism and feminism.

42
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,420
And even though Trudeau would not be a radical Marxist or feminist during his political career,

43
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,360
it is safe to say that those ideas helped inform his moderate liberalism.

44
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,580
As Justice Minister, he legalized homosexuality and created more flexible divorce laws.

45
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,380
And as Prime Minister, he helped bring Canada into the G7 as a world economic power, he

46
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,600
passed the Access to Information Act, the Canada Health Act, brought the Canadian Charter

47
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,220
of Rights and Freedoms into force, modernized Canada's constitution, and used the government

48
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,940
to help secure Canadian economic resources and infrastructure through projects like the

49
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,060
Via Rail, Petro-Canada, and the NEP, all the while giving Bruce Bolton a run for his money

50
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,740
in the evil looks department.

51
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,540
Basically, Pierre Trudeau was just like what you'd expect out of a liberal whose formative

52
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,900
years were entirely post-World War II.

53
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,940
He was a hippie who used the power of the government to expand civil rights for citizens.

54
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,180
And he also used that power to either regulate or directly compete with private companies

55
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,340
in a number of civil service industries.

56
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,420
But his past within Marxism hadn't made him a bleeding heart either.

57
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,820
When the FLQ, a Marxist terrorist group operating in Quebec, began to kidnap government officials,

58
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,620
Pierre used the War Measures Act to temporarily suspend civil liberties in order to break

59
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,300
the group, with public support.

60
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,180
Now, this is less than responsible.

61
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,700
I was suggesting that you should perhaps use a bit more restraint, which you're not doing

62
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,700
now.

63
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,820
You're going to make a big news item of this, I'm sure.

64
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820
Well, with great respect, it is a big news item.

65
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,500
Yeah, but the main thing that the FLQ is trying to gain from this is a hell of a lot of publicity

66
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
for the movement.

67
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Recognition?

68
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Yeah, and I'm suggesting that the more recognition you give to them, the greater their victory

69
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
is.

70
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
And I'm not interested in giving them a victory.

71
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:47,460
Surely it's a proposition that perhaps it would be wise to use less inflammatory terms

72
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,700
than bandits when you talk of a bunch of people who have the lives of two men in their hands.

73
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,500
You don't think they're bandits?

74
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,560
I explain it badly, I think, but what you're talking about, to me, is choices.

75
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,180
My choice is to live in a society that is free and democratic, which means that you

76
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,620
don't have people with guns running around in it.

77
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,120
And one of the things I have to give up for that choice is the fact that people like you

78
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
may be kidnapped.

79
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
Sure.

80
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,220
Sir, if you had to, right now...

81
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,180
But this isn't my choice, obviously.

82
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,580
I think it's more important to get rid of those who are committing violence against

83
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,540
the total society, and those who are trying to run the government through a parallel power

84
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,300
by establishing their authority by kidnapping and blackmail.

85
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:40,940
And I think it's our duty as a government to protect government officials and important

86
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,820
people in our society against being used as tools in this blackmail.

87
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,860
Now, you don't agree to this, but I'm sure that, once again, with hindsight, you would

88
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,980
have probably found it preferable if Mr. Cross and Mr. Laporte had been protected from kidnapping,

89
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,900
which they weren't, because the steps we're taking now weren't taken.

90
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:07,100
But even with your hindsight, I don't see how you can deny that.

91
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,180
No, I still go back to the choice that you have to make in the kind of society that you

92
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,180
live in.

93
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,260
Well, there's a lot of bleeding hearts around who just don't like to see people with helmets

94
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,260
and guns.

95
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,100
All I can say is, go on and bleed.

96
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:24,420
But it's more important to keep law and order in this society than to be worried about weak-kneed

97
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,660
people who don't like the looks of a sort of emirate.

98
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,660
At any cost?

99
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,660
At any cost?

100
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,660
How would you extend that?

101
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,900
Just watch me.

102
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,780
And then there is, of course, the joke that Pierre Trudeau didn't actually father Justin,

103
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,200
but Fidel Castro did, considering Margot Trudeau's cozy relationship with the Cuban dictator,

104
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,980
as well as how much Fidel and Justin look alike as adults.

105
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,860
It's probably not true, but hey, memers got a meme.

106
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,420
In the end, there is good reason for Pierre Trudeau to be considered one of Canada's

107
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,980
most popular Prime Ministers.

108
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,100
He did a lot to modernize Canada, secure civil rights, and bring in social programs that

109
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,160
Canadians today are both proud of and use regularly, all the while having a political

110
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,400
backbone that was unusual at the time.

111
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Justin, well, doesn't really follow in his father's footsteps.

112
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,980
Let's look at the situation surrounding Justin Trudeau's election.

113
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,840
The Liberal Party has fielded more governments and Prime Ministers than any other party in

114
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,720
Canada's history, earning the nickname the Natural Governing Party.

115
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,580
In response to this, throughout the 90s and early 2000s, most of Canada's right-wing

116
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,160
parties would merge to become the modern Conservative Party, otherwise known as the Tories.

117
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,120
From then on, five parties would have some level of political capital on the national

118
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,120
stage.

119
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,480
The Labour Party and Conservative Party would represent your general centre-left and centre-right

120
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,900
positions, similar to your average Democratic and Republican politician in the US.

121
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,280
The New Democratic Party, otherwise known as the NDP, are the hard-left European-style

122
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,660
socialist party of Bernie Sanders' dreams.

123
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,160
The Bloc, a party with policies that vary between both left and right, but primarily

124
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,440
concerns itself with Quebec sovereignty.

125
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,280
And the Green Party, which sits somewhere between the Liberals and the NDP but focuses

126
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,460
on the environment, and has never held any seats in the Canadian Senate, or more than

127
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,600
two seats in the House of Commons.

128
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,580
Throughout this period, the Liberal Party had been wracked by multiple corruption scandals,

129
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,060
and during the 2006 federal election, Stephen Harper led the Conservatives to victory.

130
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:15,580
However, because the Conservatives only held 124 seats in the House out of a total of 308,

131
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,380
Harper led a minority government in the 39th Parliament.

132
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,220
Extreme road-blocking from the Bloc, as well as multiple attempted votes of no confidence,

133
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,940
led to another election two years later, where Harper's Conservatives won roughly the same

134
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,380
number of seats in the 40th Parliament.

135
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,940
During the 40th Parliament, Harper would pro-rogue Parliament twice in order to break

136
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,860
the will of his political opponents, sparking protests.

137
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,020
This, along with Harper's cabinet being found in contempt of Parliament, an event

138
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,500
that had never before happened in any Commonwealth country, led to all of the other parties opposing

139
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,820
the government's budget.

140
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,740
Without a budget, another election was called.

141
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,300
The election of the 41st Parliament saw Stephen Harper take a majority, despite the Tory scandals

142
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,780
of the 40th.

143
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,180
This is due to several reasons.

144
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,820
One, even though the NDP had never formed a government or held official opposition status,

145
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,060
the NDP's leader, Jack Layton, had become extremely popular throughout Canada personally,

146
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,300
especially among the Trekkie population.

147
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,600
It was no secret that Layton's health had been deteriorating due to prostate cancer

148
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,180
throughout the election, and despite this, he continued to campaign.

149
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,460
At the same time, the Liberal leader, Michael Ignatieff, well, just look at this man.

150
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,340
I promise you, you'll never see a more bland, milquetoast, history-teacher-looking guy in

151
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,340
your life.

152
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,860
Oh, he actually was a history teacher.

153
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,140
Ignatieff's exceptionally poor performance at the debates in contrast with Layton's,

154
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,260
as well as the lingering memory of Liberal corruption, led to the Liberals taking only

155
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,020
34 seats and becoming the third party for the first time in history.

156
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,220
Killing that vacuum was the NDP, on the back of the charisma and love surrounding Jack

157
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,080
Layton, and the Tories.

158
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,880
In essence, Stephen Harper didn't necessarily win a majority government for himself.

159
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,820
He won it because the Liberals were exceptionally incompetent and a small-time third party ended

160
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,820
up usurping them.

161
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,540
As a majority government, Harper had a guaranteed four years of prime ministership with no possibility

162
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,260
of an early election being called.

163
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,260
In this time, he destroyed the unions that protected workers for Crown corporations,

164
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,580
intensified Canada's own war on drugs, negotiated Canada's role in the Trans-Pacific

165
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,620
Partnership, massively expanded the government and law enforcement powers to collect data

166
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,940
and spy on Canadian citizens, and removed environmental protections.

167
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,660
A lot of those things Obama did in the USA, at around the same time.

168
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:37,220
It's almost like there's no real difference between the institutional left and the institutional

169
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,000
right, you guys.

170
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,620
By the time Harper's four years were up, Canadians were absolutely fed up with the

171
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,620
man.

172
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,420
He was popular, but when his hands were inbound in a majority parliament, he made some extremely

173
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,280
unpopular decisions, and left the office as one of the least popular prime ministers of

174
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
all time.

175
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,580
In the NDP, Jack Layton's replacement after his death was a slimy, goonie beard man whose

176
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,900
speech and actions both caused him to be considered untrustworthy.

177
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,660
And after Ignatieff's massive failure in the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau rose to

178
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,260
power as the party leader.

179
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,460
And to his credit, Trudeau did spend a lot of political capital wiping clean the old

180
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,920
corruption scandals through party purges.

181
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,320
As for Ignatieff, one of the biggest lines of attack against him during the election

182
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,820
was that he had spent more of his adult life living overseas than actually in Canada.

183
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,520
And that when he inevitably lost, he'd be hightailing it right on out again.

184
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,800
And what did he do?

185
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,440
Oh, he went to teach at Harvard.

186
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,500
And then Budapest.

187
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,840
You know, I doubt you'll ever get back into politics, Mike.

188
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,960
But if you do, maybe don't make political speeches to an electorate like you'd reprimand

189
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,400
a kid for not handing in his homework on time.

190
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,240
So let's quickly recap.

191
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,500
Justin Trudeau hit the election for the 42nd parliament with a lot of things going for

192
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,500
him.

193
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Youth.

194
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,180
Rhetoric that younger Canadians reverberated with.

195
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,460
Popular left-wing political positions.

196
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,640
In essence, a redo of Trudomania.

197
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,400
He also led a rejuvenated, reformed Liberal Party against a universally despised Tory

198
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,860
Prime Minister and an NDP opposition leader who took a powerful legacy and basically destroyed

199
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,380
it, trying to create the same cult of personality around himself that organically grew around

200
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,460
his predecessor.

201
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,580
Therefore it was no surprise to anybody that Trudeau won a majority.

202
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:14,140
But as it turns out, candidate Trudeau is not the same person as Prime Minister Trudeau.

203
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,900
The website TrudeauMeter.ca tracks all of Trudeau's campaign promises, lists which

204
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,740
ones he's accomplished, which ones he's still working on, which he's not yet done

205
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,540
any work on, and which he's actively broken.

206
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,460
Looking over the list of broken promises, it's no surprise that most of them are economic

207
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,500
policies.

208
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,580
For all of the genuinely evil shit Harper did to Canada during his tenure, his educational

209
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,160
background is in economics.

210
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,520
And he led Canada through the 2008 Great Recession mostly unscathed.

211
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,560
Meanwhile, Trudeau's educational background is in literature and education, with both

212
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,820
an engineering degree and an environmental geography degree having gone uncompleted before

213
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,640
he decided to get into politics.

214
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,000
His lack of economic experience, combined with a far-left view on how the economy should

215
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,040
function, is probably what led him to promise everything under the sun while still somehow

216
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,960
maintaining a balanced budget.

217
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,880
And when questioned on this, Trudeau just didn't know what to say.

218
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,840
I'll put in a full exchange here at a town hall at Western University, just to show you

219
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
what I mean.

220
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Hello, Justin.

221
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Hello.

222
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:18,080
My name is Zach, I am 21 years old, and I am here today to speak on behalf of the silent

223
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,320
majority in this country.

224
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,440
When you were running for the office of Prime Minister, your party said that Canada would

225
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,760
run modest $10 billion deficits until the end of your term.

226
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,480
Then the budget would become balanced.

227
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,000
One year later, that is clearly no longer the case.

228
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,520
In the most recent update of long-term economic and fiscal projections released by the Department

229
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:45,320
of Finance, it is predicted that under your government, we will run deficits every year

230
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:53,320
until 2055, and we will have an enormous $1.5 trillion in debt, $1.5 trillion.

231
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,080
That is totally unacceptable.

232
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,300
To give some people some perspective, in the final year of our previous government, that

233
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:05,900
very same fiscal report projected we would have a $160 billion surplus by the year 2040.

234
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,440
Justin, what are you doing to this country?

235
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,680
You are intentionally setting up millions of young Canadians, like myself, for complete

236
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,500
and utter failure.

237
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
And what?

238
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
And for what?

239
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,500
To pander to your own moral superiority complex?

240
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,620
If you care about young Canadians and the future of this country, you need to stop what

241
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,020
you are doing right now.

242
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:32,300
Please, please, hey, everyone, this is an open town hall, if you need the proof.

243
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,980
And we'll let Zach finish his question, please.

244
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:42,260
My question is this, what, if anything, are you going to do to curb your insane and reckless

245
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,580
spending habits, which are on the verge of being criminal, to make sure that we do not

246
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,860
end up being $1.5 trillion in debt as your government predicts?

247
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,860
Okay, thank you.

248
00:14:52,860 --> 00:15:04,940
Now, in the last election, three parties were in significant contention for earning the

249
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,980
trust to govern this country.

250
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:13,220
Two of them made the decision that they were going to balance the books at all costs.

251
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:20,540
One party, my party, took the decision, recognized that what this country needed was investment

252
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:26,740
in our infrastructure, in the middle class, we needed to help people get ahead, because

253
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,300
quite frankly, under the previous government, we'd had the worst record on growth since

254
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,020
R.B. Bennett in the depths of the Great Depression.

255
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:39,380
We needed to face down the challenge that we're seeing all around the world right now

256
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,900
of a middle class that doesn't feel like success is within their grasp anymore.

257
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,620
It doesn't feel that the story of progress that has written the story of this country

258
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:56,580
from one generation to the next is actually working for them, because people aren't

259
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,900
of the opinion that, you know, their kids are automatically, even however hard they

260
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,980
work, going to be able to have a better quality of life or more opportunities than they did.

261
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,020
There are real anxieties and doubts out there.

262
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:13,960
And we're seeing that not just in Canada, but around the world, where people are fearful

263
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:20,800
and they're, you know, leaning towards closing in, closing off, pointing fingers, laying

264
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
blame.

265
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,320
And we took a chance in the last election.

266
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,360
We said, you know what, we think Canadians are better than that, and we're not going

267
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,720
to play the politics of fear and division, and we're going to be upfront with Canadians.

268
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,260
What we think we need is investment.

269
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,240
We need to invest in public transit.

270
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,400
We need to invest in social infrastructure.

271
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,060
We need to invest in green infrastructure.

272
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:49,100
We need to invest in our universities and colleges and research institutions.

273
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,720
We need to invest in our young people.

274
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,860
We need to invest in the middle class and those working hard to join.

275
00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:00,620
And the first thing we did was we lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them

276
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,180
on the wealthiest 1%.

277
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:10,220
And I'm making a jump here, Zach, but I assume that the people you voted for, the Conservatives,

278
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:15,780
voted against that particular measure, to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1% and lower

279
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,620
them on the middle class.

280
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:25,100
And then, this past summer, we brought in the Canada Child Benefit, which helps nine

281
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:31,460
out of ten families in this country with more money, tax-free, every month for the cost

282
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,300
of groceries, school supplies, raising their kids.

283
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,940
And the reason we can do that is we're giving more money to the people who need it, those

284
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,400
in the middle class and those working hard to join it, by doing less for the wealthy

285
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,020
families that received the child benefit under the previous government.

286
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:55,060
These are decisions we made because we know that giving opportunities to everyone to succeed,

287
00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:00,220
that supporting the middle class and those working hard to join it, is the way we build

288
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,620
the future.

289
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:07,540
So when I talk to Canadians about being optimistic about our future, about investing in the kinds

290
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:15,380
of things that we know are going to lead to good jobs for our kids and secure retirements

291
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:20,980
for ourselves and our parents, that are going to lead to better investments in research

292
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:26,360
and innovation, that are going to lead to solutions, better health care, better outcomes

293
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:32,300
in education, these are the kinds of things that we talked about in the last election.

294
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:38,060
And we in the Liberal Party and the Government of Canada have been consistent that our focus

295
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:43,500
is in investing in ways to grow the middle class and help Canadians move forward, and

296
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,080
I stand by that.

297
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,380
Did you notice how much of a non-answer that was?

298
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,980
Did you notice how hard Trudeau actually avoided answering the question?

299
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:56,220
I mean, if we had to glean some kind of response from that spiel, it's, yes, I'm going to

300
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,340
run up a massive deficit, but I'm going to use that money to reinvest in Canada.

301
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,260
Which sounds good, until you realize that almost all of Justin's reinvestments have

302
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,320
been completely neutered, and that the bills for them won't be coming in until long after

303
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,660
Justin's left office.

304
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,420
It's no surprise he doesn't have an answer, it's because he doesn't have to worry about

305
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,420
the solution.

306
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,400
Trudeau's support for environmentally friendly policies seem to have also been lip service

307
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
as well.

308
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,380
Despite promises to the contrary, fossil fuel subsidies remain in place for the next eight

309
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,380
years.

310
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,500
Alberta's oil sands continue to be exploited in a way that harms the environment, pipelines

311
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,940
continue to be built in ways that disregard the owners and occupants of the land the pipeline

312
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,940
sits on.

313
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,660
Our government has been consistent from the very beginning, that Canadians need economic

314
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,460
development while at the same time protecting the environment and the well-being of future

315
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,460
generations.

316
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:49,300
We need to make sure that the processes are folding in, community perspectives, partnerships

317
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:55,860
with Indigenous peoples, the top-notch science and response concerns that people have.

318
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,380
There isn't a country in the world that would find billions of barrels of oil and leave it

319
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,780
in the ground while there is a market for it.

320
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,700
And with these words, the Trudeau government approved the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain

321
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,820
Project that runs from Alberta to Burnaby, British Columbia, a project that has sparked

322
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,620
protests across the country.

323
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:19,740
The government is also giving a green light to another project, the Line 3 pipeline expansion

324
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,380
from Alberta to Wisconsin.

325
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,520
Environmentalists wanted red lights on all projects.

326
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,640
It's not a question of if there will be a spill, it's a question of when there will be a spill.

327
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,040
Oh, and speaking of that, Justin, back before you got into politics, didn't you object

328
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,680
to a zinc mine in the Northwest Territories that would have poisoned the Nahanni River,

329
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,580
a World Heritage Site due to both its ecological importance and the native people who lived

330
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,580
there for thousands of years?

331
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,980
Do you still hold those views, considering you've broken your promise about the Site

332
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,440
C Dam project, which would submerge native lands upon its completion?

333
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,700
Oh, I guess it's okay, because you've also refused to ratify the UN's Declaration of

334
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,560
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, even though that was another promise, with members of

335
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,960
your cabinet going so far as to say it was unworkable as law.

336
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,660
We can keep going if you like, there's broken promises here about military spending, about

337
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:09,200
veterans affairs, about gun control, but let's get to the one that I think is the most important

338
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,380
broken promise on this list, Trudeau's abandonment of electoral reform.

339
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,460
Canada currently uses a first-past-the-post electoral system, whoever has the most votes

340
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,460
wins the election.

341
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,460
Simple, right?

342
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,260
First-past-the-post voting generally trends towards party consolidation, and mega-parties

343
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,380
become the norm.

344
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,440
This happens because parties tend to not want to split the vote.

345
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,440
For example, like in Canada during the 39th and 40th Parliaments, when you have one right-leaning

346
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,800
party and two left-leaning parties, often the left-leaning voters will vote for either

347
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,960
one or the other, splitting the vote between the two options.

348
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,700
Tory politicians ended up walking away with seats even though their constituents largely

349
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,300
disagreed with them, because the votes for either the Liberal or the NDP candidate weren't

350
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,020
higher than the Conservative candidate.

351
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,680
Even though the total number of votes for both of them was much higher, in first-past-the-post

352
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,140
voting systems, larger parties tend to cannibalize smaller parties in an effort not to split

353
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,140
votes.

354
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:04,340
The US is the most extreme example of this, with politics dominated by two massive parties,

355
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,220
while people desiring nuanced political positions are generally left out in the cold.

356
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,540
Trudeau acknowledged that first-past-the-post voting helped destroy the Liberals in the

357
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,900
past, and made it a core promise of his campaign to change Canada's electoral system.

358
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,980
So I'm proposing we make every vote count.

359
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:28,000
We are committed to ensuring that the 2015 election will be the last federal election

360
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,940
using first-past-the-post.

361
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,860
Even when first-past-the-post voting brought him into power, he reiterated that promise

362
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,860
multiple times.

363
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,700
And there are other voting systems that would work just fine in a political environment

364
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,720
that has a polarity of different parties, like Canada's.

365
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,000
But on February 1st, 2017, Trudeau walked back on this promise.

366
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,720
The Right Honourable Prime Minister.

367
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,960
Mr. Speaker, over the past year, we consulted with hundreds of thousands of Canadians to

368
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,440
hear their views on transforming our electoral system.

369
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,160
It's very clear, as people in this House know, I have long preferred a preferential

370
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
ballot.

371
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:35,340
The members opposite wanted a proportional representation.

372
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,680
The official opposition wanted a referendum.

373
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,160
There is no consensus.

374
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,960
There is no clear path forward.

375
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:48,440
It would be irresponsible for us to do something that harms Canada's stability when, in fact,

376
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:54,160
what we need is moving forward on growth for the middle class and support.

377
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:59,160
The Honourable Member for Outremont.

378
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,120
The Prime Minister obviously never read the report, Mr. Speaker.

379
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,080
My democracy charade didn't even ask Canadians if they wanted to change the voting system.

380
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
But you know what?

381
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,640
At almost every single one of the Prime Minister's town halls, someone asked him about democratic

382
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,640
reform.

383
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,860
So as the Prime Minister now fabricates evidence to claim Canadians didn't want what he got

384
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:25,480
elected on, my question is, what expression from Canadians would have been sufficient

385
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,400
to get the Prime Minister to respect his own promise?

386
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,300
The Prime Minister made this promise hundreds of times during the election.

387
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,040
He wrote it in his party's platform.

388
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,640
He put it in his very first throne speech.

389
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
You know what?

390
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,120
Canadians trusted 1,813 times since they got elected.

391
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,720
That's the real number, Mr. Speaker.

392
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,680
How can Canadians trust anything this Prime Minister has to say after he has so blatantly

393
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,640
and intentionally betrayed his own word?

394
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,640
The Honourable Prime Minister.

395
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,880
Mr. Speaker, we spent a year listening to Canadians, talking with them, hearing from

396
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,800
a broad range of views, seeing the firmly held views that a number of people feel on

397
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:12,580
that, and understanding that there is no clear path forward, there is no consensus, a referendum

398
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:17,560
would be a bad idea, moving forward in a divisive policy would be a bad idea.

399
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:22,280
The fact of the matter is, I am not going to do something that is wrong for Canadians

400
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,120
just to tick off a box on an electoral platform.

401
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,380
That's not the kind of Prime Minister I will be.

402
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,340
In a letter Trudeau wrote to Karina Gould, the Minister of Democratic Institutions,

403
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,340
he stated,

404
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,580
Furthermore, without a clear preference or a clear question, a referendum would not be

405
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,100
in Canada's interest.

406
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,900
Changing the electoral system will not be in your mandate.

407
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,780
Justin, changing the electoral system is in your mandate.

408
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,020
It's what you ran on.

409
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,580
It's why a lot of people voted for you.

410
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,620
And it's what a lot of people expect you to do.

411
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,660
In my opinion, this is one of the bigger issues, domestically, Canada needs to solve.

412
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,600
A lot of other things stem from this.

413
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,300
The economy, the refugee crisis, Canada's role overseas, healthcare, the environment,

414
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,300
you name it.

415
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,380
We're going to have a much harder time actually solving these issues, rather than simply bending

416
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:16,300
to corporate interests or international interests, as long as a voting method that serves to

417
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,380
polarize the political system exists.

418
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,420
Props to the NDP's Nathan Cullen though, who went on TV to outright call Trudeau a

419
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,420
liar and a coward.

420
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:29,820
Let me start by saying I was a bit surprised that it wasn't Mr. Trudeau out here, somehow

421
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,700
lacking the courage and fortitude to make this announcement himself.

422
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:40,460
He certainly had no problems making the promise, but not yet the courage to break that promise

423
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,540
in front of you all here today.

424
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:48,340
That rather than keep his word to the millions of Canadians who voted for him and the hundreds

425
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:54,220
of thousands of Canadians who engaged in good faith with Mr. Trudeau over this question

426
00:26:54,220 --> 00:27:02,140
of how to strengthen and broaden our democracy, Mr. Trudeau chose today instead to spit in

427
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,660
their face.

428
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:10,740
I want to choose my words very carefully, I know words matter, the words that we speak

429
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,740
here and in Parliament matter.

430
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:19,380
What Mr. Trudeau approved himself today was to be a liar, was to be of the most cynical

431
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:26,960
variety of politician, saying whatever it takes to get elected, then once elected seeking

432
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:36,180
any excuse, however weak, however absent, to justify that lie to Canadians.

433
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,740
He promised to be different.

434
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:45,660
He promised not to conduct himself this way, but to conduct himself with honour and integrity.

435
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:51,260
I'm not sure the Liberals understand what the word respect means, because to have made

436
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:57,620
such a black and white promise and then to feel so casual and cynical in breaking that

437
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:04,540
promise, it puts into question any commitment, any promise Mr. Trudeau makes or has made

438
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,380
in the past.

439
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,900
The Liberals and Mr. Trudeau today made themselves the best argument of why we desperately need

440
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,700
electoral reform.

441
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,920
However not everything Trudeau said and done has been tracked by Trudeau-meter.

442
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,660
One of the most important ones to me personally, Trudeau's stance on the TPP, he basically

443
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,120
pulled Hillary Clinton on.

444
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,920
Like Hillary, during the election he recognized that the TPP wasn't popular with the electorate,

445
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,620
so like Hillary, he took a wait and see approach with the TPP, stating that he didn't really

446
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,540
know if he supported it or not.

447
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,780
We're always going to need to be engaged in international trade.

448
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:44,540
It's what has helped Canada become the successful country that we are right now.

449
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:48,780
We need to continue to do it and it's important that we get it right, which is why I'm going

450
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:54,980
to take a very careful look at the provisions and listen to Canadians from across the country

451
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:01,340
and have them get an opportunity to express their concerns in committees and before Parliament

452
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,820
as we seek ratification of this deal.

453
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,820
Is that a yes?

454
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:11,900
That is, I look forward to seeing the details of the deal, but we go into it from a position

455
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,780
of being resolutely and consistently, I might add, pro-trade.

456
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:22,100
Again with the TPP, you've said that you want to look at the details of the deal before

457
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,380
you make a call on it, but there are some details that are out this morning and I'm

458
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,100
guessing you've had a look at them.

459
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,820
Is there anything that you've seen so far that gives you pause, particularly with regard

460
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,900
to the auto parts and dairy sectors?

461
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,860
Obviously there have been a lot of questions about that and I look forward to hearing from

462
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:45,340
representatives of those industries, from concerned Canadians, from labour, from manufacturers

463
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:50,660
about the impacts and the challenges of this particular deal, which is why I am committed

464
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:56,500
to a full and open discussion in the House of Commons, a debate on this, and if I become

465
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:03,460
Prime Minister and earned your trust on October 19th, we will ratify this properly in the

466
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:07,300
House of Commons after a fulsome and responsible discussion.

467
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,180
And 12 days after the Canadian election, in a call to the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo

468
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,020
Abe, Trudeau reiterated his government's support for the TPP, just like Hillary would

469
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,700
have done had she been elected.

470
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,060
This is how we know for a fact that Justin Trudeau is a miracle worker.

471
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,860
He was able to get all of those opinions from average Canadians, as well as have a rigorous

472
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,580
debate about the topic in the House of Commons, all in just 12 days.

473
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,500
Did you see that it was good and rest on the 13th day too, Justin?

474
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,420
And then there's Motion 103.

475
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,940
M103 gained international attention, something that Canadian politics rarely does, because

476
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,140
in an era of migrants flowing into Europe unchecked, of Donald Trump's Great Wall

477
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:47,600
of America, of ISIS and Islamic attacks in France and Germany and Sweden, Canada decided

478
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,100
to ratify a motion condemning Islamophobia, presumably in response to the Quebec Mosque

479
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,100
shooting.

480
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,780
When the motion was first tabled before that attack, support for it only began to surge

481
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,780
in the House afterward.

482
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:02,140
There's been a few misconceptions about M103, it's not a bill or a law, it hasn't

483
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,940
become illegal to be Islamophobic in Canada or anything.

484
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,740
Rather, it is a motion, which is basically a suggestion that the government look into

485
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,580
a particular topic, do some research, and get back to parliament with their results

486
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,580
somewhere down the road.

487
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,620
Let's read M103 in its entirety, it's not very long.

488
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,140
That, in the opinion of the House, the government should

489
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,740
A. Recognize the need to quell the increasing public climate of hate and fear

490
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:29,220
B. Condemn Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination

491
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,960
and take note of the House of Commons petition E411 and the issues raised by it

492
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,980
and C. Request that the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage undertake a study on

493
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,980
how the government could

494
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:44,420
1. Develop a whole-of-government approach to reducing or eliminating systemic racism

495
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,620
and religious discrimination, including Islamophobia

496
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:51,260
2. In Canada, while ensuring a community-centered focus with a holistic response through evidence-based

497
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,600
policymaking, and

498
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:57,180
3. Collect data to contextualize hate crime reports and to conduct needs assessments for

499
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,580
impacted communities, and

500
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,020
4. That the committee should present its findings and recommendations to the House of Commons

501
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,980
no later than 240 calendar days from the adoption of this motion, provided that in its report,

502
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,740
the committee should make recommendations that the government may use to better reflect

503
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,920
the enshrined rights and freedoms in the Constitution Acts, including the Canadian Charter of Rights

504
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
and Freedoms.

505
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,840
This basically says, we think that Canadian culture and Canadian citizens have an Islamophobia

506
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,920
problem, and we need to stop it. Let's look into how.

507
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,920
It doesn't define Islamophobia for the purposes of the motion, casting an incredibly wide

508
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,920
net.

509
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,840
Criticism of Islam as a religion can be considered Islamophobic.

510
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,240
Criticism of Sharia law as a political framework can also be considered Islamophobic.

511
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,680
Let me repeat, some definitions of Islamophobia consider the statement, I am not a Muslim

512
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,700
and I don't want Sharia law to be the law of the land, to be Islamophobic, and this

513
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,460
motion may also consider that statement to be hateful.

514
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,680
This motion also singles Islam out for special consideration, though it does give lip service

515
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,960
to other forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination.

516
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,140
Irka Khalid, the motion's author, was unwilling to entertain any compromise on the specific

517
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,420
wording of the motion.

518
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:10,220
A counter-motion, tabled by the Tories, did not specifically mention Islamophobia, instead

519
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,260
condemning all forms of systemic racism, religious intolerance, and discrimination

520
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:18,300
of Muslims, Jews, Christians, Sikhs, Hindus, and other religious communities.

521
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:23,460
This motion was defeated, with the Conservatives, the Bloc, the NDP, and the Greens all voting

522
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,020
for it, and the Liberals near-anonymously voting against it.

523
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,940
These facts, combined with the House of Commons' history of passing similar motions for Jews

524
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:37,580
and Yazidis in 2016, and Coptic Christians in 2011, makes me think that M103 is liberal

525
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,580
grandstanding.

526
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,620
Khalid's efforts may come from a genuine concern for Canada's Muslim community.

527
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,820
She is a Muslim herself, though clearly a liberal one, but she's also a politician

528
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,380
riding a liberal wave.

529
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:52,580
M103 is a way of building up her own brand within the Liberal Party, and a way for the

530
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,380
Liberal Party to champion a new rising star with a proper demographic appeal.

531
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:00,540
If this wasn't simply Khalid grandstanding with liberal backing, the Tory motion that

532
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:04,280
did almost exactly the same thing wouldn't have been universally opposed.

533
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:09,520
My concern, however, is with what happens in 240 days, after whatever committee returns

534
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,640
to parliament with its findings on M103.

535
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,840
M103 does not restrict free speech, but the steps beyond that might.

536
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,440
It may not currently be considered hateful to be a critic of Islam's treatment of women,

537
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,640
its politically expansionist rhetoric, or its penchant for terror attacks, but it might

538
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,120
be in the future.

539
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,560
And that's what scares me.

540
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:32,080
M103's findings may lead to a future where it is considered, for example, a hate crime

541
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:37,080
to object to female genital mutilation, as it's considered a cultural practice by Muslims.

542
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,960
But what does Trudeau himself think about all of this?

543
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,800
Well, during International Woman's Day 2017, the House of Commons held a mock session of

544
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,280
parliament comprising entirely of young female students, which Trudeau was present for.

545
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,080
During this event, he answered a question regarding Islamophobia.

546
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,080
Let's listen in.

547
00:34:53,080 --> 00:35:02,200
With Islamophobia, we have been seeing over the past while a rise in expressions of hate

548
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,240
and in hate crimes across the country.

549
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,600
Yesterday, we had an attack on a mosque in Calgary, but we also had attacks on the Jewish

550
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,720
community and the GTA.

551
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:23,560
We have examples of racism, intolerance, and hatred spiking up all across the country over

552
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,760
the past… past… past months.

553
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:32,520
Obviously, the terrible terrorist attack in Quebec City was an example of it, was a particularly

554
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,700
brutal example of it, but we have an awful lot more to do.

555
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:45,780
I may reassure you to know that last fall, this House unanimously, every member in this

556
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:51,780
House approved of a motion condemning Islamophobia.

557
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,660
It was unanimously approved.

558
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,800
That was a good measure.

559
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,700
It was a moment where everyone came together and agreed.

560
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:06,300
It was a motion by Mr. Mulcair, and we were glad to have this House condemn Islamophobia.

561
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:17,180
More recently, when a motion came forward to not just condemn Islamophobia, but to ask

562
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:24,720
the House of Commons committee to study it, to get into the issues around it and to see

563
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,540
what we can do in a very open way about moving forward on something that is unfortunately

564
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,940
increasing in terms of intolerance.

565
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:38,380
That has created a bit of… a bit of a debate.

566
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:44,420
And on one hand, I'd like to think that, you know, everyone can all get up and always

567
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,900
condemn things that are bad and move on.

568
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:57,700
But on the other hand, sometimes it's useful for people to stand up and disagree, to point

569
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,660
out to the rest of us that there's still a lot of work to do.

570
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:06,260
If everyone had just agreed and we'd moved on, maybe we wouldn't be addressing the

571
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:12,620
very scary and real spike in hate speech.

572
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:17,900
Maybe we wouldn't be challenging each other as politicians in the things that we're

573
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:28,300
saying, in the choices we make as leaders to play up divisions and fears.

574
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:33,700
It's easy to try and scare people into voting for you.

575
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:38,260
It's easy to try and say something that's going to pit a neighbour against a neighbour.

576
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,820
If you do it in a sneaky way and use coded language, maybe you won't get called on

577
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,100
it by the majority.

578
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,900
Maybe you'll get to slip it through.

579
00:37:48,900 --> 00:38:00,620
Well if M103, condemning Islamophobia, actually gets people to notice that there are people

580
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:08,140
uncomfortable with that idea, that there are people who still have problems with the idea

581
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:13,860
that we would condemn discrimination against Muslims, then we have to know.

582
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,820
We have to expose that and we have to deal with it as a society.

583
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:23,380
Because if this room isn't a reflection of what's happening in our streets, in our

584
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:28,700
towns, in our communities, then we're not dealing with the real things that Canadians

585
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,460
expect us to deal with.

586
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,660
So do we have a problem with Islamophobia in this country?

587
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,700
Yes we do.

588
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:41,060
Do we have a problem with anti-Semitism in this country?

589
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,060
Yes we do.

590
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,540
Do we have a problem in this country with discrimination and hatred?

591
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,260
Yes we do.

592
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:54,900
And we need to talk about this and we need to challenge each other to be better on this.

593
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,260
We need to recognize that we still have a problem because there are men out there who

594
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,700
will not say, yes I am a feminist.

595
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:11,140
We need to recognize that saying and bringing forward truths that are uncomfortable to some

596
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:16,980
and challenge each other to shift our ways of thinking out of the easy ways we do.

597
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:22,940
To lay open wounds to sunshine and disinfectant.

598
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:29,940
That is also the role that we have in this house and that we have as active, engaged

599
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,140
citizens in this country.

600
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,620
We need to speak up.

601
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:42,980
The silent majority of good people in Canada who are not intolerant, who are not bigoted,

602
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:47,100
need to know they can be less silent.

603
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:51,540
We need to speak up for the things we believe in.

604
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:56,940
This house and every house across this country needs to be a reflection of that.

605
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,540
There are obvious problems here.

606
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:03,760
First, Trudeau makes the classic SJW mistake in conflating hate crimes with hate speech

607
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,360
or hateful thoughts or expressions of hate.

608
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,100
And no, they're not the same thing.

609
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,080
Words can never be violence.

610
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,660
Calling a black man a nigger is not violence.

611
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,320
It might make you a racist asshole.

612
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,280
It might make you somebody that I would never ever want to associate with, do business with

613
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,600
or whatever.

614
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,420
But it is not violent.

615
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,600
It's not the same as attacking a black man.

616
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,240
Not using a trans person's preferred pronouns is not a violent act.

617
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,520
Not liking Islam as a religion or a political philosophy is not a violent act.

618
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,200
You can't lump in all the hateful comments, all the racial slurs and whatever with the

619
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,600
number of actual attacks and claim, oh, Canada is so violent towards Muslims.

620
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,960
That's not how it works.

621
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,600
Secondly, Trudeau is right in labeling the Quebec mosque shooting a terrorist attack.

622
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:49,000
It didn't use explosives or airplanes, but it was a mass murder designed not only to

623
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,320
kill but to inspire terror within the affected communities.

624
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:57,080
And preventing these attacks, responding to these attacks, helping victims of these attacks

625
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:01,040
and seeing the perpetrators of these attacks brought to justice is absolutely the government's

626
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,040
job.

627
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,680
It is not the government's job to police the population for thought crime.

628
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,680
In conflating rhetoric with violence, Trudeau has taken on a task that will never, ever

629
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,080
be completed.

630
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,960
The government cannot wipe out racist ideas or attitudes or even speech within the population.

631
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,860
It can massively curtail human rights in order to get rid of some of it, sure.

632
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,360
But how far do you go before you consider the job done?

633
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:26,700
If your criteria, Justin, is to wipe out not only hateful actions, not only hateful speech,

634
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:30,680
but hateful attitudes and ideas, the job will never ever be done.

635
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,040
Even if there's not a shred of evidence that any hate exists.

636
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,820
This is the path to totalitarianism, and it's a far cry from what Trudeau used to say about

637
00:41:37,820 --> 00:42:01,840
Stephen Harper's conduct as Prime Minister back in the day, too.

638
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,960
recently departed Sun News Network.

639
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:11,120
Their instincts are now to be suspicious of people who do not share their beliefs.

640
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:16,280
To harden divisions with people whose views differ from their own.

641
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,260
In my seven years in Parliament, I have heard the Conservative Prime Minister accuse two

642
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:26,520
different leaders of the NDP of sympathizing with terrorists.

643
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:33,560
The Conservative Party of Canada accuse notable Magillian Irwin-Kotler of anti-Semitism.

644
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:38,560
And the former Public Safety Minister to declare, you're either with us or you're with the

645
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,280
child pornographers.

646
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,600
For that particular effort, the Prime Minister eventually rewarded him with a judicial appointment.

647
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:52,760
This, my friends, is not your parents' Conservative Party.

648
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:59,680
Their approach to politics might work in the short term, but it is corrosive over time.

649
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,000
Especially in a diverse country like Canada.

650
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,440
It stokes anxiety and ferments fear.

651
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:13,800
Instead of encouraging Canadians to fight for one another's liberty, it tells us to

652
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,080
be suspicious of each other's choices.

653
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:23,160
Mr. Harper and I disagree fundamentally about a great many things.

654
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,560
But none, perhaps more so than this.

655
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:32,640
Leading this country should mean you bring Canadians together.

656
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,120
You do not divide them against one another.

657
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:45,880
Fear is a dangerous thing.

658
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:51,600
Once it is sanctioned by the state, there is no telling where it might lead.

659
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:58,000
It is always a short path to walk from being suspicious of our fellow citizens to taking

660
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,240
actions to restrict their liberty.

661
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,400
It's like I said at the beginning, candidate Trudeau is not the same man as Prime Minister

662
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,400
Trudeau.

663
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,400
Candidate Trudeau said,

664
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,920
Fear is a dangerous thing.

665
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:16,640
Once it is sanctioned by the state, there is no telling where it might lead.

666
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:23,060
It is always a short path to walk from being suspicious of our fellow citizens to taking

667
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,120
actions to restrict their liberty.

668
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,760
While Prime Minister Trudeau said,

669
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:38,720
M103 condemning Islamophobia actually gets people to notice that there are people uncomfortable

670
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:45,560
with that idea, that there are people who still have problems with the idea that we

671
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:51,040
would condemn discrimination against Muslims, then we have to know.

672
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,720
We have to expose that and we have to deal with it as a society.

673
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,760
Thirdly, this position of Trudeau's really makes his fervent claim of being a feminist

674
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,960
ring hollow, doesn't it?

675
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,480
I mean, Trudeau has no problem with shoehorning that shit in whenever he can.

676
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,960
Bringing up Gamergate like Zoe Quinn was an absolute angel.

677
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,000
My mom raised me to be a feminist.

678
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,440
My father raised me, he was of a different generation, but he raised me to respect and

679
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,160
defend everyone's rights.

680
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:27,400
And I deeply grounded my own identity in that, and I'm proud to say I'm a feminist.

681
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:33,840
And the things that we see online, whether it's issues like Gamergate and video games

682
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:39,960
and misogyny in popular culture, is something that we need people to stand clearly against.

683
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,000
Or while at a visit to the UN as well.

684
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:50,920
First of all, I'm going to keep saying loud and clearly that I am a feminist until, hear

685
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:55,520
me roar, until it is met with a shrug.

686
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,520
Or how about the world economic form?

687
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,880
Surely there's nothing else worth talking about there other than feminism, right?

688
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,760
By the way, we shouldn't be afraid of the word feminist.

689
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,160
Men and women should use it to describe themselves anytime they want.

690
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,440
But Trudeau has been caught out multiple times for placing Muslims on a higher tier than

691
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,080
women on the progressive stack.

692
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,440
For example, before he became prime minister, the Tory government decided to put forward

693
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,680
a motion condemning female genital mutilation, honour killings, and forced marriage as barbaric.

694
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,320
And Justin Trudeau objected on the grounds that using the word barbaric to describe other

695
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,960
cultures was racist.

696
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,720
He later apologized, presumably because at this point he had little political power,

697
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,320
but I don't think his opinions actually changed too much.

698
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,320
Why?

699
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,440
Because Trudeau, as prime minister, has had no problem attending events at Canadian mosques

700
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,040
where the non-Muslim women who were with him were forced to wear headscarves, enter

701
00:46:42,040 --> 00:47:02,800
and leave through side doors, and sit on isolated balconies or off to the side away from men.

702
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,120
When you're a social justice warrior or a regressive leftist, a minority religion practiced

703
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,720
primarily by racially minority individuals on the one hand, and feminism and women's

704
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,120
rights on the other hand, which one do you ultimately choose?

705
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,760
Well, look at the face of Ontario's Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne, and you get your answer.

706
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,840
And although I don't really like the Canadian-based right-leaning news outlet The Rebel, they

707
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,420
were still the only ones actually willing to hold Trudeau's feet to the fire on this

708
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,420
issue.

709
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:32,000
Prime Minister, it's about the event you attended yesterday in the morning, and some

710
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,760
progressive, what I guess I would call progressive feminists, who very much support your work

711
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,280
for gender equality and very admiring of that work, were disappointed that you attended

712
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,360
a gender-segregated event.

713
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:48,120
And so I guess my question would be, how do you reconcile your brand as a self-styled

714
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:53,440
feminist prime minister with attendance at a gender-segregated event?

715
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,620
Look at the balls on this guy.

716
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,940
Are any left-leaning news organizations going to stand up here?

717
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,040
Any feminist academics or writers?

718
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,040
Any at all?

719
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,520
Is it going to yet again be the job of the Conservatives to make a principled stand for

720
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,680
women's rights, gay rights, human rights against Islam?

721
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,260
Just like in the US, the UK, France, and elsewhere?

722
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:15,120
Are there any liberal politicians left in the fucking world willing to look beyond somebody's

723
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:19,740
race or religion or gender and say, your human rights abuses are unacceptable, and your culture,

724
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:23,120
your religion, and your ideology don't excuse that fact?

725
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:32,120
The fact is, the values that define Canada include respect and openness towards our full

726
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,120
diversity.

727
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,800
Understanding that diversity is a source of strength, not a source of weakness, is why

728
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:44,280
I think that politicians need to be focused on bringing people together rather than fomenting

729
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,280
divisions.

730
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:51,720
And that's why I am happy to attend community events in churches, temples, synagogues, mosques.

731
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:58,360
I'm happy to engage with Canadians where they are and talk about the full range of

732
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,800
opportunities that we're working hard to create.

733
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:11,840
Yeah, yeah, Justin, you're not on the campaign trail anymore.

734
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:15,640
Robotically regurgitating talking points like Marco Rubio's assertion that Barack Obama

735
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:20,440
knows exactly what he's doing does not answer the fucking question.

736
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,160
I'm somebody who has never voted Conservative in my life.

737
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:27,400
And I grew up with the general idea, as did many others my age, that the Liberals and

738
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,240
the NDP generally had the backs of average Canadians on social issues, even if they were

739
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,080
hit and miss economically.

740
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,600
This was something I actually discussed with ScrumpMonkey, or El Scrumpo on Twitter, on

741
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,880
a call recently, and that discussion helped me form a hypothesis regarding liberal abandonment

742
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,340
of the left, in both Canada and elsewhere.

743
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:49,000
When I first became politically knowledgeable on even the most basic level, I was about

744
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
eight years old.

745
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,880
Yes, I am the predecessor to the woke eight-year-old.

746
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,880
Though not really.

747
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,680
At that time, I knew who the Prime Minister of Canada was, Jean Chretien.

748
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,560
I knew that he led the Liberal Party, and I knew that the Conservative Party was in

749
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,560
opposition to him.

750
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,800
I knew that he had a stroke that caused one side of his face to droop, and I knew that

751
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,000
he made light of it by saying that he didn't talk out of both sides of his mouth.

752
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,840
And as I grew older, my knowledge of politics also naturally grew.

753
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,320
In high school, I remember holding the opinion that gay marriage should be legal.

754
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,480
And I remember being considered a radical at that time for that position.

755
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,520
I remember the fervor when gay marriage did actually become legal in 2003.

756
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,840
And in that call with Scrump, we sat down and did a very brief look over at the major

757
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,440
notable achievements of Prime Ministers of my time.

758
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,880
Mulroney, Conservative.

759
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,160
Privatization of several Crown Corporations.

760
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,240
NAFTA.

761
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,560
Support in the First Gulf War.

762
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,140
Campbell, Conservative.

763
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,640
First female Prime Minister.

764
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,720
Mulroney bailed out of the party when he became unpopular, dumping all the problems on her.

765
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,720
She only held the office for three months.

766
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,120
Chretien, Liberal.

767
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,120
Quebec Referendum.

768
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,120
Kyoto Protocol.

769
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,720
Invasion of Afghanistan.

770
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,160
Opposition to the Second Iraq War.

771
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,440
Martin, Liberal.

772
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,560
Civil Marriage Act.

773
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,280
Rejection of American Missile Treaty.

774
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,840
Joining the G20?

775
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,120
Liberal corruption scandals.

776
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,760
Harper, Conservative.

777
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,640
Hollowing out of Canada's softwood lumber industry.

778
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,600
Apologies for residential schools.

779
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,560
2008 Great Recession.

780
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,480
Multiple uses of prorogation.

781
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,680
Parliamentary contempt.

782
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,320
Withdrawal from Kyoto.

783
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,360
Crackdown on unions, human rights, and freedom of expression.

784
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,920
Trudeau, Liberal.

785
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,320
His father's good name.

786
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,600
Though both Liberal and Tory Prime Ministers have had both good and bad accomplishments,

787
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,440
at a cursory glance, it seems like the Liberals have done more good and the Tories have done

788
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,440
more bad.

789
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,400
The Liberals have acted more in accordance with civil liberties and the Tories have acted

790
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,360
more in accordance with corporate interests.

791
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,440
But America's third way corporatist democratic policies have come to Canada, full swing,

792
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,560
with Justin Trudeau.

793
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,020
And for a lot of young Liberals, hell, for a lot of middle-aged Liberals who are looking

794
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:43,920
for a left-leaning party willing to take a stand against human rights abuses, even if

795
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,160
those abuses come from racial or religious minorities, they are no longer seeing any

796
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,160
champions within the Liberal Party.

797
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,600
That said, Trudeau is content to call you a racist, a sexist, and an Islamophobe, all

798
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,680
the while pursuing economic policies ranging between dysfunctional to corporatists, with

799
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,980
no room for the Canadian citizen in between.

800
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:04,420
This is the reason why Liberals are abandoning left-leaning parties in the UK.

801
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:07,480
This is the reason why Liberals abandon Hillary in the US.

802
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,600
And in my opinion, if an election were called today, this is the reason why Trudeau's

803
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,880
Liberal Party would find itself in serious trouble.

804
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,880
And it's also why the radical left protest group, Antifa, spray-paints Liberals get the

805
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,880
bullet too.

806
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:20,960
It's not racism.

807
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,180
It's not sexism.

808
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,600
It's not Islamophobia.

809
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,880
It's not homophobia.

810
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,880
It's because curtailing personal freedom and liberty is explicitly what liberalism fights

811
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,340
against, even when Canada's quote-unquote Liberal Party wants to do it.

812
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:38,480
As for Trudeau himself, I think the pressure of his father's legacy, plus finally managing

813
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:43,060
to grasp real power, has fundamentally changed the man into somebody his younger self would

814
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,360
have found bitter disappointment in.

815
00:52:44,360 --> 00:53:02,360
I

816
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,960
know he was only 18 here, but this Trudeau is somebody willing to say something unpopular

817
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,200
because he thought it was right.

818
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:12,680
He was fighting against a Quebec independence referendum, a very popular independence referendum,

819
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,680
while living in Montreal.

820
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,440
Maybe this is an instance where he didn't completely get wiser as he got older.

821
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,800
Trudeau also once said that he found the large numbers of people turning to him for potential

822
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,080
party leadership solely because of his family name to be unsettling.

823
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,080
What happened to that Trudeau?

824
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,180
Where did he go?

825
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:28,200
He once completely rejected identity politics.

826
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:34,380
I'll make the case that Canadian liberty has got one of the world's most vexatious

827
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,060
problems right.

828
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:42,420
The interplay between individual freedom and collective identity.

829
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:47,960
We understand that people are defined both by the things that unite us and distinguish

830
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:57,340
us from one another, languages, cultures, faiths, even, importantly, gender and sexual

831
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,900
orientation.

832
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:07,420
However, we also know that all of these contribute to a person's identity but don't define

833
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,840
it.

834
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:15,040
These things all find their highest, most concrete expression in the individual human

835
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,560
beings who embody them.

836
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,040
What happened to that Trudeau?

837
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,360
What happened to the Trudeau that would have been horrified at praising Fidel Castro upon

838
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,600
the dictator's death?

839
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,640
What happened to the Trudeau that said this?

840
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,120
Our politics are supposed to be retail these days.

841
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:35,560
We're expected to talk about very specific measures targeted at key audiences and swing

842
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:41,400
voters, especially in an election year.

843
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,720
But I have an old-fashioned view.

844
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:50,080
I think policies are concrete expressions of values.

845
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:54,920
Priorities are important.

846
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,840
Specific commitments are important.

847
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:02,200
But there is no way to predict the events you will have to navigate during your time

848
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:08,440
in office, let alone the measures that will be required to manage those events.

849
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,260
People aren't naive, they know that.

850
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:17,600
So Canadians ought to know what core values motivate their leaders' decisions, whatever

851
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,640
events may throw at them.

852
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:24,160
If policies are expressions of values, Justin, what values can we say that you hold?

853
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,800
Ah well, at least he kept his promise to legalize weed, you guys.

854
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,800
2018, here we come.

855
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,320
Hope you enjoyed the video, pals.

856
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,120
This one underwent several rewrites and took a very long time to research and put together.
