0	4000	Oh Justin Trudeau, a lot of Canadians had high hopes for you.
4000	6560	I know I didn't, which is why I didn't vote for you.
6560	10360	But a lot of people did, and most of them are just now beginning to realize exactly
10360	12080	what kind of man they voted for.
12080	17040	Trudeau's gotten a lot of online international attention recently, due to Motion 103, which
17040	18440	I'll discuss a little bit later.
18440	22400	But as a Canadian myself, I think it's important to talk about a lot of the other things, the
22400	26200	domestic stuff that might not make it into the news in the US or UK.
26200	30560	And yes, I do think it's important for people in the US or the UK to know what's going on
30560	31560	in Canada.
31560	33120	I know we're just Canada guys.
33120	38720	But we're still a large world economy, a middle power militarily, and most importantly, Justin
38720	42120	Trudeau is a canary in the coal mine for the rest of you, regarding what happens when a
42120	47120	hard left candidate not only takes office, but with a decisive majority in a modern first
47120	48120	world country.
48120	53040	For those of you not in the know, Justin Trudeau is sort of like our Obama, minus the opposition
53040	56160	obstructionism as well as Obama's public speaking ability.
56160	60920	You'll be running against Stephen Harper in the next election.
60920	70480	I think so I've, you know, we, you know what, I'll let I'll let the conservatives figure
70480	71480	that one out.
71480	75080	Their campaigns were run remarkably similar in that they both emphasize their candidates
75080	78440	youth as a way to show that they were more connected and knowledgeable but the problems
78440	79960	a modern nation faces.
79960	84700	They also both abandoned that rhetoric after taking office, instead opting to pursue corporate
84700	86200	left interests.
86200	90380	But to really get into the trouble with Justin Trudeau, we have to go back, way back.
90380	94700	All the way back to Justin's father, the 15th Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Trudeau.
94700	99340	A quick note here before we begin, I'm about to provide a lot of Canadian political history,
99340	103160	as I suspect most viewers of this video won't be Canadian and won't know about the political
103160	105800	climate that allowed Justin Trudeau to become Prime Minister.
105800	109640	I think it's important to describe the way the stage was set before Trudeau's arrival,
109640	113260	but if you're just not interested in that, you can jump ahead to the time shown here
113260	116020	where I'll get into the meat of Justin Trudeau's actions.
116020	120460	I warn you though, without the proper context, they may not make as much sense.
120460	124000	Pierre Trudeau was one of Canada's most popular and longest serving Prime Ministers
124000	125000	in history.
125000	129220	The large amount of public infatuation with him was nicknamed Trudeau-mania by the media
129220	133620	at the time, a label that very briefly came back into public use to describe Justin during
133620	134620	his own campaign.
134620	139540	Trudeau spent his youth as what we would call today a proto-SJW, interested in topics such
139540	141220	as Marxism and feminism.
141220	145420	And even though Trudeau would not be a radical Marxist or feminist during his political career,
145420	149360	it is safe to say that those ideas helped inform his moderate liberalism.
149360	154580	As Justice Minister, he legalized homosexuality and created more flexible divorce laws.
154580	159380	And as Prime Minister, he helped bring Canada into the G7 as a world economic power, he
159380	163600	passed the Access to Information Act, the Canada Health Act, brought the Canadian Charter
163600	168220	of Rights and Freedoms into force, modernized Canada's constitution, and used the government
168220	171940	to help secure Canadian economic resources and infrastructure through projects like the
171940	177060	Via Rail, Petro-Canada, and the NEP, all the while giving Bruce Bolton a run for his money
177060	178740	in the evil looks department.
178740	182540	Basically, Pierre Trudeau was just like what you'd expect out of a liberal whose formative
182540	184900	years were entirely post-World War II.
184900	188940	He was a hippie who used the power of the government to expand civil rights for citizens.
188940	193180	And he also used that power to either regulate or directly compete with private companies
193180	195340	in a number of civil service industries.
195340	198420	But his past within Marxism hadn't made him a bleeding heart either.
198420	203820	When the FLQ, a Marxist terrorist group operating in Quebec, began to kidnap government officials,
203820	207620	Pierre used the War Measures Act to temporarily suspend civil liberties in order to break
207620	209300	the group, with public support.
255340	257180	Now, this is less than responsible.
257180	260700	I was suggesting that you should perhaps use a bit more restraint, which you're not doing
260700	261700	now.
261700	263820	You're going to make a big news item of this, I'm sure.
263820	266820	Well, with great respect, it is a big news item.
266820	271500	Yeah, but the main thing that the FLQ is trying to gain from this is a hell of a lot of publicity
271500	272500	for the movement.
272500	273500	Recognition?
273500	277500	Yeah, and I'm suggesting that the more recognition you give to them, the greater their victory
277500	278500	is.
278500	279500	And I'm not interested in giving them a victory.
279500	287460	Surely it's a proposition that perhaps it would be wise to use less inflammatory terms
287460	292700	than bandits when you talk of a bunch of people who have the lives of two men in their hands.
292700	295500	You don't think they're bandits?
295500	300560	I explain it badly, I think, but what you're talking about, to me, is choices.
300560	304180	My choice is to live in a society that is free and democratic, which means that you
304180	307620	don't have people with guns running around in it.
307620	312120	And one of the things I have to give up for that choice is the fact that people like you
312120	313120	may be kidnapped.
313120	314120	Sure.
314120	317220	Sir, if you had to, right now...
317220	321180	But this isn't my choice, obviously.
321180	325580	I think it's more important to get rid of those who are committing violence against
325580	330540	the total society, and those who are trying to run the government through a parallel power
330540	334300	by establishing their authority by kidnapping and blackmail.
334300	340940	And I think it's our duty as a government to protect government officials and important
340940	345820	people in our society against being used as tools in this blackmail.
345820	350860	Now, you don't agree to this, but I'm sure that, once again, with hindsight, you would
350860	356980	have probably found it preferable if Mr. Cross and Mr. Laporte had been protected from kidnapping,
356980	360900	which they weren't, because the steps we're taking now weren't taken.
360900	367100	But even with your hindsight, I don't see how you can deny that.
367100	371180	No, I still go back to the choice that you have to make in the kind of society that you
371180	372180	live in.
372180	375260	Well, there's a lot of bleeding hearts around who just don't like to see people with helmets
375260	376260	and guns.
376260	378100	All I can say is, go on and bleed.
378100	384420	But it's more important to keep law and order in this society than to be worried about weak-kneed
384420	388660	people who don't like the looks of a sort of emirate.
388660	389660	At any cost?
389660	390660	At any cost?
390660	391660	How would you extend that?
391660	392900	Just watch me.
392900	396780	And then there is, of course, the joke that Pierre Trudeau didn't actually father Justin,
396780	401200	but Fidel Castro did, considering Margot Trudeau's cozy relationship with the Cuban dictator,
401200	403980	as well as how much Fidel and Justin look alike as adults.
403980	406860	It's probably not true, but hey, memers got a meme.
406860	410420	In the end, there is good reason for Pierre Trudeau to be considered one of Canada's
410420	411980	most popular Prime Ministers.
411980	416100	He did a lot to modernize Canada, secure civil rights, and bring in social programs that
416100	420160	Canadians today are both proud of and use regularly, all the while having a political
420160	422400	backbone that was unusual at the time.
422400	426400	Justin, well, doesn't really follow in his father's footsteps.
426400	429980	Let's look at the situation surrounding Justin Trudeau's election.
429980	433840	The Liberal Party has fielded more governments and Prime Ministers than any other party in
433840	436720	Canada's history, earning the nickname the Natural Governing Party.
436720	440580	In response to this, throughout the 90s and early 2000s, most of Canada's right-wing
440580	445160	parties would merge to become the modern Conservative Party, otherwise known as the Tories.
445160	449120	From then on, five parties would have some level of political capital on the national
449120	450120	stage.
450120	453480	The Labour Party and Conservative Party would represent your general centre-left and centre-right
453480	457900	positions, similar to your average Democratic and Republican politician in the US.
457900	462280	The New Democratic Party, otherwise known as the NDP, are the hard-left European-style
462280	464660	socialist party of Bernie Sanders' dreams.
464660	469160	The Bloc, a party with policies that vary between both left and right, but primarily
469160	471440	concerns itself with Quebec sovereignty.
471440	475280	And the Green Party, which sits somewhere between the Liberals and the NDP but focuses
475280	479460	on the environment, and has never held any seats in the Canadian Senate, or more than
479460	481600	two seats in the House of Commons.
481600	485580	Throughout this period, the Liberal Party had been wracked by multiple corruption scandals,
485580	490060	and during the 2006 federal election, Stephen Harper led the Conservatives to victory.
490060	495580	However, because the Conservatives only held 124 seats in the House out of a total of 308,
495580	498380	Harper led a minority government in the 39th Parliament.
498380	502220	Extreme road-blocking from the Bloc, as well as multiple attempted votes of no confidence,
502220	505940	led to another election two years later, where Harper's Conservatives won roughly the same
505940	508380	number of seats in the 40th Parliament.
508380	511940	During the 40th Parliament, Harper would pro-rogue Parliament twice in order to break
511940	514860	the will of his political opponents, sparking protests.
514860	519020	This, along with Harper's cabinet being found in contempt of Parliament, an event
519020	523500	that had never before happened in any Commonwealth country, led to all of the other parties opposing
523500	524820	the government's budget.
524820	526740	Without a budget, another election was called.
526740	531300	The election of the 41st Parliament saw Stephen Harper take a majority, despite the Tory scandals
531300	532780	of the 40th.
532780	534180	This is due to several reasons.
534180	538820	One, even though the NDP had never formed a government or held official opposition status,
538820	544060	the NDP's leader, Jack Layton, had become extremely popular throughout Canada personally,
544060	546300	especially among the Trekkie population.
546300	549600	It was no secret that Layton's health had been deteriorating due to prostate cancer
549600	553180	throughout the election, and despite this, he continued to campaign.
553180	558460	At the same time, the Liberal leader, Michael Ignatieff, well, just look at this man.
558460	562340	I promise you, you'll never see a more bland, milquetoast, history-teacher-looking guy in
562340	563340	your life.
563500	566860	Oh, he actually was a history teacher.
566860	571140	Ignatieff's exceptionally poor performance at the debates in contrast with Layton's,
583140	587260	as well as the lingering memory of Liberal corruption, led to the Liberals taking only
587260	591020	34 seats and becoming the third party for the first time in history.
591020	595220	Killing that vacuum was the NDP, on the back of the charisma and love surrounding Jack
595220	597080	Layton, and the Tories.
597080	600880	In essence, Stephen Harper didn't necessarily win a majority government for himself.
600880	604820	He won it because the Liberals were exceptionally incompetent and a small-time third party ended
604820	605820	up usurping them.
605820	610540	As a majority government, Harper had a guaranteed four years of prime ministership with no possibility
610540	612260	of an early election being called.
612260	616260	In this time, he destroyed the unions that protected workers for Crown corporations,
616260	620580	intensified Canada's own war on drugs, negotiated Canada's role in the Trans-Pacific
620580	624620	Partnership, massively expanded the government and law enforcement powers to collect data
624620	627940	and spy on Canadian citizens, and removed environmental protections.
627940	631660	A lot of those things Obama did in the USA, at around the same time.
631660	637220	It's almost like there's no real difference between the institutional left and the institutional
637220	639000	right, you guys.
639000	642620	By the time Harper's four years were up, Canadians were absolutely fed up with the
642620	643620	man.
643620	647420	He was popular, but when his hands were inbound in a majority parliament, he made some extremely
647420	651280	unpopular decisions, and left the office as one of the least popular prime ministers of
651280	652280	all time.
652280	657580	In the NDP, Jack Layton's replacement after his death was a slimy, goonie beard man whose
657580	660900	speech and actions both caused him to be considered untrustworthy.
660900	664660	And after Ignatieff's massive failure in the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau rose to
664660	666260	power as the party leader.
666260	670460	And to his credit, Trudeau did spend a lot of political capital wiping clean the old
670460	672920	corruption scandals through party purges.
672920	676320	As for Ignatieff, one of the biggest lines of attack against him during the election
676320	679820	was that he had spent more of his adult life living overseas than actually in Canada.
679820	683520	And that when he inevitably lost, he'd be hightailing it right on out again.
683520	684800	And what did he do?
684800	686440	Oh, he went to teach at Harvard.
686440	687500	And then Budapest.
687500	690840	You know, I doubt you'll ever get back into politics, Mike.
690840	694960	But if you do, maybe don't make political speeches to an electorate like you'd reprimand
694960	697400	a kid for not handing in his homework on time.
697400	699240	So let's quickly recap.
699240	702500	Justin Trudeau hit the election for the 42nd parliament with a lot of things going for
702500	703500	him.
703500	704500	Youth.
704500	706180	Rhetoric that younger Canadians reverberated with.
706180	708460	Popular left-wing political positions.
708460	710640	In essence, a redo of Trudomania.
710640	715400	He also led a rejuvenated, reformed Liberal Party against a universally despised Tory
715400	720860	Prime Minister and an NDP opposition leader who took a powerful legacy and basically destroyed
720860	725380	it, trying to create the same cult of personality around himself that organically grew around
725380	726460	his predecessor.
726460	729580	Therefore it was no surprise to anybody that Trudeau won a majority.
729580	734140	But as it turns out, candidate Trudeau is not the same person as Prime Minister Trudeau.
734140	738900	The website TrudeauMeter.ca tracks all of Trudeau's campaign promises, lists which
738900	742740	ones he's accomplished, which ones he's still working on, which he's not yet done
742740	745540	any work on, and which he's actively broken.
745540	749460	Looking over the list of broken promises, it's no surprise that most of them are economic
749460	750500	policies.
750500	754580	For all of the genuinely evil shit Harper did to Canada during his tenure, his educational
754580	756160	background is in economics.
756160	759520	And he led Canada through the 2008 Great Recession mostly unscathed.
759520	763560	Meanwhile, Trudeau's educational background is in literature and education, with both
763560	767820	an engineering degree and an environmental geography degree having gone uncompleted before
767820	769640	he decided to get into politics.
769640	774000	His lack of economic experience, combined with a far-left view on how the economy should
774000	778040	function, is probably what led him to promise everything under the sun while still somehow
778040	779960	maintaining a balanced budget.
779960	782880	And when questioned on this, Trudeau just didn't know what to say.
782880	786840	I'll put in a full exchange here at a town hall at Western University, just to show you
786840	787840	what I mean.
787840	788840	Hello, Justin.
788840	789840	Hello.
789840	798080	My name is Zach, I am 21 years old, and I am here today to speak on behalf of the silent
798080	800320	majority in this country.
800320	804440	When you were running for the office of Prime Minister, your party said that Canada would
804440	808760	run modest $10 billion deficits until the end of your term.
808760	811480	Then the budget would become balanced.
811480	814000	One year later, that is clearly no longer the case.
814000	819520	In the most recent update of long-term economic and fiscal projections released by the Department
819520	825320	of Finance, it is predicted that under your government, we will run deficits every year
825320	833320	until 2055, and we will have an enormous $1.5 trillion in debt, $1.5 trillion.
833320	835080	That is totally unacceptable.
835080	839300	To give some people some perspective, in the final year of our previous government, that
839300	845900	very same fiscal report projected we would have a $160 billion surplus by the year 2040.
845900	848440	Justin, what are you doing to this country?
848440	852680	You are intentionally setting up millions of young Canadians, like myself, for complete
852680	854500	and utter failure.
854500	855500	And what?
855500	856500	And for what?
856500	859500	To pander to your own moral superiority complex?
859500	863620	If you care about young Canadians and the future of this country, you need to stop what
863620	865020	you are doing right now.
865020	872300	Please, please, hey, everyone, this is an open town hall, if you need the proof.
872300	876980	And we'll let Zach finish his question, please.
876980	882260	My question is this, what, if anything, are you going to do to curb your insane and reckless
882260	886580	spending habits, which are on the verge of being criminal, to make sure that we do not
886580	890860	end up being $1.5 trillion in debt as your government predicts?
890860	892860	Okay, thank you.
892860	904940	Now, in the last election, three parties were in significant contention for earning the
904940	907980	trust to govern this country.
907980	913220	Two of them made the decision that they were going to balance the books at all costs.
913220	920540	One party, my party, took the decision, recognized that what this country needed was investment
920540	926740	in our infrastructure, in the middle class, we needed to help people get ahead, because
926740	932300	quite frankly, under the previous government, we'd had the worst record on growth since
932300	935020	R.B. Bennett in the depths of the Great Depression.
935020	939380	We needed to face down the challenge that we're seeing all around the world right now
939380	944900	of a middle class that doesn't feel like success is within their grasp anymore.
944900	949620	It doesn't feel that the story of progress that has written the story of this country
949620	956580	from one generation to the next is actually working for them, because people aren't
956580	960900	of the opinion that, you know, their kids are automatically, even however hard they
960900	964980	work, going to be able to have a better quality of life or more opportunities than they did.
964980	968020	There are real anxieties and doubts out there.
968020	973960	And we're seeing that not just in Canada, but around the world, where people are fearful
973960	980800	and they're, you know, leaning towards closing in, closing off, pointing fingers, laying
980800	981800	blame.
981800	984320	And we took a chance in the last election.
984320	987360	We said, you know what, we think Canadians are better than that, and we're not going
987360	992720	to play the politics of fear and division, and we're going to be upfront with Canadians.
992720	995260	What we think we need is investment.
995260	997240	We need to invest in public transit.
997240	999400	We need to invest in social infrastructure.
999400	1002060	We need to invest in green infrastructure.
1002060	1009100	We need to invest in our universities and colleges and research institutions.
1009100	1011720	We need to invest in our young people.
1011720	1014860	We need to invest in the middle class and those working hard to join.
1014860	1020620	And the first thing we did was we lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them
1020620	1023180	on the wealthiest 1%.
1023180	1030220	And I'm making a jump here, Zach, but I assume that the people you voted for, the Conservatives,
1030220	1035780	voted against that particular measure, to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1% and lower
1035780	1037620	them on the middle class.
1037620	1045100	And then, this past summer, we brought in the Canada Child Benefit, which helps nine
1045100	1051460	out of ten families in this country with more money, tax-free, every month for the cost
1051460	1055300	of groceries, school supplies, raising their kids.
1055300	1058940	And the reason we can do that is we're giving more money to the people who need it, those
1058940	1063400	in the middle class and those working hard to join it, by doing less for the wealthy
1063400	1068020	families that received the child benefit under the previous government.
1068020	1075060	These are decisions we made because we know that giving opportunities to everyone to succeed,
1075060	1080220	that supporting the middle class and those working hard to join it, is the way we build
1080220	1081620	the future.
1081620	1087540	So when I talk to Canadians about being optimistic about our future, about investing in the kinds
1087540	1095380	of things that we know are going to lead to good jobs for our kids and secure retirements
1095380	1100980	for ourselves and our parents, that are going to lead to better investments in research
1100980	1106360	and innovation, that are going to lead to solutions, better health care, better outcomes
1106360	1112300	in education, these are the kinds of things that we talked about in the last election.
1112300	1118060	And we in the Liberal Party and the Government of Canada have been consistent that our focus
1118060	1123500	is in investing in ways to grow the middle class and help Canadians move forward, and
1123500	1125080	I stand by that.
1125080	1127380	Did you notice how much of a non-answer that was?
1127380	1130980	Did you notice how hard Trudeau actually avoided answering the question?
1130980	1136220	I mean, if we had to glean some kind of response from that spiel, it's, yes, I'm going to
1136220	1140340	run up a massive deficit, but I'm going to use that money to reinvest in Canada.
1140340	1144260	Which sounds good, until you realize that almost all of Justin's reinvestments have
1144260	1148320	been completely neutered, and that the bills for them won't be coming in until long after
1148320	1149660	Justin's left office.
1149660	1153420	It's no surprise he doesn't have an answer, it's because he doesn't have to worry about
1153420	1154420	the solution.
1154420	1158400	Trudeau's support for environmentally friendly policies seem to have also been lip service
1158400	1159400	as well.
1159400	1163380	Despite promises to the contrary, fossil fuel subsidies remain in place for the next eight
1163380	1164380	years.
1164380	1167500	Alberta's oil sands continue to be exploited in a way that harms the environment, pipelines
1167500	1170940	continue to be built in ways that disregard the owners and occupants of the land the pipeline
1170940	1171940	sits on.
1171940	1176660	Our government has been consistent from the very beginning, that Canadians need economic
1176660	1182460	development while at the same time protecting the environment and the well-being of future
1182460	1183460	generations.
1183460	1189300	We need to make sure that the processes are folding in, community perspectives, partnerships
1189300	1195860	with Indigenous peoples, the top-notch science and response concerns that people have.
1195860	1201380	There isn't a country in the world that would find billions of barrels of oil and leave it
1201380	1203780	in the ground while there is a market for it.
1203780	1207700	And with these words, the Trudeau government approved the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain
1207700	1212820	Project that runs from Alberta to Burnaby, British Columbia, a project that has sparked
1212820	1214620	protests across the country.
1214620	1219740	The government is also giving a green light to another project, the Line 3 pipeline expansion
1219740	1222380	from Alberta to Wisconsin.
1222380	1225520	Environmentalists wanted red lights on all projects.
1225520	1229640	It's not a question of if there will be a spill, it's a question of when there will be a spill.
1229640	1234040	Oh, and speaking of that, Justin, back before you got into politics, didn't you object
1234040	1237680	to a zinc mine in the Northwest Territories that would have poisoned the Nahanni River,
1237680	1241580	a World Heritage Site due to both its ecological importance and the native people who lived
1241580	1242580	there for thousands of years?
1242580	1245980	Do you still hold those views, considering you've broken your promise about the Site
1245980	1249440	C Dam project, which would submerge native lands upon its completion?
1249440	1253700	Oh, I guess it's okay, because you've also refused to ratify the UN's Declaration of
1253700	1257560	the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, even though that was another promise, with members of
1257560	1260960	your cabinet going so far as to say it was unworkable as law.
1260960	1264660	We can keep going if you like, there's broken promises here about military spending, about
1264660	1269200	veterans affairs, about gun control, but let's get to the one that I think is the most important
1269200	1273380	broken promise on this list, Trudeau's abandonment of electoral reform.
1273380	1277460	Canada currently uses a first-past-the-post electoral system, whoever has the most votes
1277460	1278460	wins the election.
1278460	1279460	Simple, right?
1279460	1284260	First-past-the-post voting generally trends towards party consolidation, and mega-parties
1284260	1285380	become the norm.
1285380	1288440	This happens because parties tend to not want to split the vote.
1288440	1293440	For example, like in Canada during the 39th and 40th Parliaments, when you have one right-leaning
1293440	1297800	party and two left-leaning parties, often the left-leaning voters will vote for either
1297800	1300960	one or the other, splitting the vote between the two options.
1300960	1304700	Tory politicians ended up walking away with seats even though their constituents largely
1304700	1308300	disagreed with them, because the votes for either the Liberal or the NDP candidate weren't
1308300	1310020	higher than the Conservative candidate.
1310020	1313680	Even though the total number of votes for both of them was much higher, in first-past-the-post
1313680	1318140	voting systems, larger parties tend to cannibalize smaller parties in an effort not to split
1318140	1319140	votes.
1319140	1324340	The US is the most extreme example of this, with politics dominated by two massive parties,
1324340	1328220	while people desiring nuanced political positions are generally left out in the cold.
1328220	1331540	Trudeau acknowledged that first-past-the-post voting helped destroy the Liberals in the
1331540	1335900	past, and made it a core promise of his campaign to change Canada's electoral system.
1335900	1340980	So I'm proposing we make every vote count.
1340980	1348000	We are committed to ensuring that the 2015 election will be the last federal election
1348000	1349940	using first-past-the-post.
1349940	1353860	Even when first-past-the-post voting brought him into power, he reiterated that promise
1353860	1354860	multiple times.
1354860	1358700	And there are other voting systems that would work just fine in a political environment
1358700	1361720	that has a polarity of different parties, like Canada's.
1361720	1366000	But on February 1st, 2017, Trudeau walked back on this promise.
1391720	1394720	The Right Honourable Prime Minister.
1394720	1399960	Mr. Speaker, over the past year, we consulted with hundreds of thousands of Canadians to
1399960	1403440	hear their views on transforming our electoral system.
1403440	1409160	It's very clear, as people in this House know, I have long preferred a preferential
1409160	1410160	ballot.
1410160	1415340	The members opposite wanted a proportional representation.
1415340	1418680	The official opposition wanted a referendum.
1418680	1420160	There is no consensus.
1420160	1421960	There is no clear path forward.
1421960	1428440	It would be irresponsible for us to do something that harms Canada's stability when, in fact,
1428440	1434160	what we need is moving forward on growth for the middle class and support.
1434160	1439160	The Honourable Member for Outremont.
1439160	1443120	The Prime Minister obviously never read the report, Mr. Speaker.
1443120	1448080	My democracy charade didn't even ask Canadians if they wanted to change the voting system.
1448080	1449080	But you know what?
1449080	1453640	At almost every single one of the Prime Minister's town halls, someone asked him about democratic
1453640	1454640	reform.
1454640	1459860	So as the Prime Minister now fabricates evidence to claim Canadians didn't want what he got
1459860	1465480	elected on, my question is, what expression from Canadians would have been sufficient
1465480	1469400	to get the Prime Minister to respect his own promise?
1469400	1472300	The Prime Minister made this promise hundreds of times during the election.
1472300	1474040	He wrote it in his party's platform.
1474040	1475640	He put it in his very first throne speech.
1475640	1476640	You know what?
1476640	1480120	Canadians trusted 1,813 times since they got elected.
1480120	1481720	That's the real number, Mr. Speaker.
1481720	1487680	How can Canadians trust anything this Prime Minister has to say after he has so blatantly
1487680	1491640	and intentionally betrayed his own word?
1491640	1496640	The Honourable Prime Minister.
1496640	1501880	Mr. Speaker, we spent a year listening to Canadians, talking with them, hearing from
1501880	1506800	a broad range of views, seeing the firmly held views that a number of people feel on
1506800	1512580	that, and understanding that there is no clear path forward, there is no consensus, a referendum
1512580	1517560	would be a bad idea, moving forward in a divisive policy would be a bad idea.
1517560	1522280	The fact of the matter is, I am not going to do something that is wrong for Canadians
1522280	1525120	just to tick off a box on an electoral platform.
1525120	1530380	That's not the kind of Prime Minister I will be.
1530380	1534340	In a letter Trudeau wrote to Karina Gould, the Minister of Democratic Institutions,
1534340	1535340	he stated,
1539340	1543580	Furthermore, without a clear preference or a clear question, a referendum would not be
1543580	1545100	in Canada's interest.
1545100	1547900	Changing the electoral system will not be in your mandate.
1547900	1551780	Justin, changing the electoral system is in your mandate.
1551780	1553020	It's what you ran on.
1553020	1554580	It's why a lot of people voted for you.
1554580	1556620	And it's what a lot of people expect you to do.
1556660	1560660	In my opinion, this is one of the bigger issues, domestically, Canada needs to solve.
1560660	1562600	A lot of other things stem from this.
1562600	1567300	The economy, the refugee crisis, Canada's role overseas, healthcare, the environment,
1567300	1568300	you name it.
1568300	1572380	We're going to have a much harder time actually solving these issues, rather than simply bending
1572380	1576300	to corporate interests or international interests, as long as a voting method that serves to
1576300	1578380	polarize the political system exists.
1578380	1582420	Props to the NDP's Nathan Cullen though, who went on TV to outright call Trudeau a
1582420	1583420	liar and a coward.
1583740	1589820	Let me start by saying I was a bit surprised that it wasn't Mr. Trudeau out here, somehow
1589820	1593700	lacking the courage and fortitude to make this announcement himself.
1593700	1600460	He certainly had no problems making the promise, but not yet the courage to break that promise
1600460	1602540	in front of you all here today.
1602540	1608340	That rather than keep his word to the millions of Canadians who voted for him and the hundreds
1608340	1614220	of thousands of Canadians who engaged in good faith with Mr. Trudeau over this question
1614220	1622140	of how to strengthen and broaden our democracy, Mr. Trudeau chose today instead to spit in
1622140	1623660	their face.
1623660	1630740	I want to choose my words very carefully, I know words matter, the words that we speak
1630740	1633740	here and in Parliament matter.
1633740	1639380	What Mr. Trudeau approved himself today was to be a liar, was to be of the most cynical
1639380	1646960	variety of politician, saying whatever it takes to get elected, then once elected seeking
1646960	1656180	any excuse, however weak, however absent, to justify that lie to Canadians.
1656180	1658740	He promised to be different.
1658740	1665660	He promised not to conduct himself this way, but to conduct himself with honour and integrity.
1665660	1671260	I'm not sure the Liberals understand what the word respect means, because to have made
1671260	1677620	such a black and white promise and then to feel so casual and cynical in breaking that
1677620	1684540	promise, it puts into question any commitment, any promise Mr. Trudeau makes or has made
1684540	1687380	in the past.
1687380	1692900	The Liberals and Mr. Trudeau today made themselves the best argument of why we desperately need
1692900	1694700	electoral reform.
1694700	1698920	However not everything Trudeau said and done has been tracked by Trudeau-meter.
1698920	1703660	One of the most important ones to me personally, Trudeau's stance on the TPP, he basically
1703660	1705120	pulled Hillary Clinton on.
1705120	1709920	Like Hillary, during the election he recognized that the TPP wasn't popular with the electorate,
1709920	1714620	so like Hillary, he took a wait and see approach with the TPP, stating that he didn't really
1714620	1716540	know if he supported it or not.
1716540	1719780	We're always going to need to be engaged in international trade.
1719780	1724540	It's what has helped Canada become the successful country that we are right now.
1724540	1728780	We need to continue to do it and it's important that we get it right, which is why I'm going
1728780	1734980	to take a very careful look at the provisions and listen to Canadians from across the country
1734980	1741340	and have them get an opportunity to express their concerns in committees and before Parliament
1741340	1744820	as we seek ratification of this deal.
1744820	1745820	Is that a yes?
1746180	1751900	That is, I look forward to seeing the details of the deal, but we go into it from a position
1751900	1756780	of being resolutely and consistently, I might add, pro-trade.
1756780	1762100	Again with the TPP, you've said that you want to look at the details of the deal before
1762100	1765380	you make a call on it, but there are some details that are out this morning and I'm
1765380	1767100	guessing you've had a look at them.
1767100	1770820	Is there anything that you've seen so far that gives you pause, particularly with regard
1770820	1772900	to the auto parts and dairy sectors?
1772900	1777860	Obviously there have been a lot of questions about that and I look forward to hearing from
1777860	1785340	representatives of those industries, from concerned Canadians, from labour, from manufacturers
1785340	1790660	about the impacts and the challenges of this particular deal, which is why I am committed
1790660	1796500	to a full and open discussion in the House of Commons, a debate on this, and if I become
1796500	1803460	Prime Minister and earned your trust on October 19th, we will ratify this properly in the
1803460	1807300	House of Commons after a fulsome and responsible discussion.
1807300	1811180	And 12 days after the Canadian election, in a call to the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo
1811180	1815020	Abe, Trudeau reiterated his government's support for the TPP, just like Hillary would
1815020	1816700	have done had she been elected.
1816700	1820060	This is how we know for a fact that Justin Trudeau is a miracle worker.
1820060	1823860	He was able to get all of those opinions from average Canadians, as well as have a rigorous
1823860	1827580	debate about the topic in the House of Commons, all in just 12 days.
1827580	1831500	Did you see that it was good and rest on the 13th day too, Justin?
1831500	1833420	And then there's Motion 103.
1833420	1837940	M103 gained international attention, something that Canadian politics rarely does, because
1837940	1842140	in an era of migrants flowing into Europe unchecked, of Donald Trump's Great Wall
1842140	1847600	of America, of ISIS and Islamic attacks in France and Germany and Sweden, Canada decided
1847600	1852100	to ratify a motion condemning Islamophobia, presumably in response to the Quebec Mosque
1852100	1853100	shooting.
1853340	1856780	When the motion was first tabled before that attack, support for it only began to surge
1856780	1857780	in the House afterward.
1857780	1862140	There's been a few misconceptions about M103, it's not a bill or a law, it hasn't
1862140	1864940	become illegal to be Islamophobic in Canada or anything.
1864940	1868740	Rather, it is a motion, which is basically a suggestion that the government look into
1868740	1872580	a particular topic, do some research, and get back to parliament with their results
1872580	1873580	somewhere down the road.
1873580	1876620	Let's read M103 in its entirety, it's not very long.
1876620	1879140	That, in the opinion of the House, the government should
1879140	1883740	A. Recognize the need to quell the increasing public climate of hate and fear
1883740	1889220	B. Condemn Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination
1889220	1893960	and take note of the House of Commons petition E411 and the issues raised by it
1893960	1897980	and C. Request that the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage undertake a study on
1897980	1898980	how the government could
1898980	1904420	1. Develop a whole-of-government approach to reducing or eliminating systemic racism
1904420	1906620	and religious discrimination, including Islamophobia
1906620	1911260	2. In Canada, while ensuring a community-centered focus with a holistic response through evidence-based
1911260	1912600	policymaking, and
1912600	1917180	3. Collect data to contextualize hate crime reports and to conduct needs assessments for
1917180	1918580	impacted communities, and
1918580	1922020	4. That the committee should present its findings and recommendations to the House of Commons
1922020	1926980	no later than 240 calendar days from the adoption of this motion, provided that in its report,
1926980	1930740	the committee should make recommendations that the government may use to better reflect
1930740	1934920	the enshrined rights and freedoms in the Constitution Acts, including the Canadian Charter of Rights
1934920	1935920	and Freedoms.
1935920	1940840	This basically says, we think that Canadian culture and Canadian citizens have an Islamophobia
1940840	1943920	problem, and we need to stop it. Let's look into how.
1943920	1947920	It doesn't define Islamophobia for the purposes of the motion, casting an incredibly wide
1947920	1948920	net.
1948920	1953840	Criticism of Islam as a religion can be considered Islamophobic.
1953840	1958240	Criticism of Sharia law as a political framework can also be considered Islamophobic.
1958240	1963680	Let me repeat, some definitions of Islamophobia consider the statement, I am not a Muslim
1963680	1968700	and I don't want Sharia law to be the law of the land, to be Islamophobic, and this
1968700	1971460	motion may also consider that statement to be hateful.
1971460	1975680	This motion also singles Islam out for special consideration, though it does give lip service
1975680	1978960	to other forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination.
1978960	1984140	Irka Khalid, the motion's author, was unwilling to entertain any compromise on the specific
1984140	1985420	wording of the motion.
1985420	1990220	A counter-motion, tabled by the Tories, did not specifically mention Islamophobia, instead
1990220	1994260	condemning all forms of systemic racism, religious intolerance, and discrimination
1994260	1998300	of Muslims, Jews, Christians, Sikhs, Hindus, and other religious communities.
1998300	2003460	This motion was defeated, with the Conservatives, the Bloc, the NDP, and the Greens all voting
2003460	2007020	for it, and the Liberals near-anonymously voting against it.
2007020	2010940	These facts, combined with the House of Commons' history of passing similar motions for Jews
2010940	2017580	and Yazidis in 2016, and Coptic Christians in 2011, makes me think that M103 is liberal
2017580	2018580	grandstanding.
2018580	2022620	Khalid's efforts may come from a genuine concern for Canada's Muslim community.
2022620	2026820	She is a Muslim herself, though clearly a liberal one, but she's also a politician
2026820	2028380	riding a liberal wave.
2028380	2032580	M103 is a way of building up her own brand within the Liberal Party, and a way for the
2032580	2036380	Liberal Party to champion a new rising star with a proper demographic appeal.
2036380	2040540	If this wasn't simply Khalid grandstanding with liberal backing, the Tory motion that
2040540	2044280	did almost exactly the same thing wouldn't have been universally opposed.
2044280	2049520	My concern, however, is with what happens in 240 days, after whatever committee returns
2049520	2051640	to parliament with its findings on M103.
2051640	2055840	M103 does not restrict free speech, but the steps beyond that might.
2055840	2060440	It may not currently be considered hateful to be a critic of Islam's treatment of women,
2060440	2064640	its politically expansionist rhetoric, or its penchant for terror attacks, but it might
2064640	2066120	be in the future.
2066120	2067560	And that's what scares me.
2067560	2072080	M103's findings may lead to a future where it is considered, for example, a hate crime
2072080	2077080	to object to female genital mutilation, as it's considered a cultural practice by Muslims.
2077080	2079960	But what does Trudeau himself think about all of this?
2079960	2084800	Well, during International Woman's Day 2017, the House of Commons held a mock session of
2084800	2089280	parliament comprising entirely of young female students, which Trudeau was present for.
2089280	2092080	During this event, he answered a question regarding Islamophobia.
2092080	2093080	Let's listen in.
2093080	2102200	With Islamophobia, we have been seeing over the past while a rise in expressions of hate
2102200	2105240	and in hate crimes across the country.
2105240	2110600	Yesterday, we had an attack on a mosque in Calgary, but we also had attacks on the Jewish
2110600	2112720	community and the GTA.
2112720	2123560	We have examples of racism, intolerance, and hatred spiking up all across the country over
2123560	2126760	the past… past… past months.
2126760	2132520	Obviously, the terrible terrorist attack in Quebec City was an example of it, was a particularly
2132520	2137700	brutal example of it, but we have an awful lot more to do.
2137820	2145780	I may reassure you to know that last fall, this House unanimously, every member in this
2145780	2151780	House approved of a motion condemning Islamophobia.
2151780	2155660	It was unanimously approved.
2155660	2157800	That was a good measure.
2157800	2160700	It was a moment where everyone came together and agreed.
2160700	2166300	It was a motion by Mr. Mulcair, and we were glad to have this House condemn Islamophobia.
2166300	2177180	More recently, when a motion came forward to not just condemn Islamophobia, but to ask
2177180	2184720	the House of Commons committee to study it, to get into the issues around it and to see
2184720	2190540	what we can do in a very open way about moving forward on something that is unfortunately
2190540	2193940	increasing in terms of intolerance.
2193980	2198380	That has created a bit of… a bit of a debate.
2198380	2204420	And on one hand, I'd like to think that, you know, everyone can all get up and always
2204420	2208900	condemn things that are bad and move on.
2208900	2217700	But on the other hand, sometimes it's useful for people to stand up and disagree, to point
2217700	2221660	out to the rest of us that there's still a lot of work to do.
2221660	2226260	If everyone had just agreed and we'd moved on, maybe we wouldn't be addressing the
2226260	2232620	very scary and real spike in hate speech.
2232620	2237900	Maybe we wouldn't be challenging each other as politicians in the things that we're
2237900	2248300	saying, in the choices we make as leaders to play up divisions and fears.
2249300	2253700	It's easy to try and scare people into voting for you.
2253700	2258260	It's easy to try and say something that's going to pit a neighbour against a neighbour.
2258260	2262820	If you do it in a sneaky way and use coded language, maybe you won't get called on
2262820	2265100	it by the majority.
2265100	2268900	Maybe you'll get to slip it through.
2268900	2280620	Well if M103, condemning Islamophobia, actually gets people to notice that there are people
2280620	2288140	uncomfortable with that idea, that there are people who still have problems with the idea
2288140	2293860	that we would condemn discrimination against Muslims, then we have to know.
2293860	2297820	We have to expose that and we have to deal with it as a society.
2297820	2303380	Because if this room isn't a reflection of what's happening in our streets, in our
2303380	2308700	towns, in our communities, then we're not dealing with the real things that Canadians
2308700	2311460	expect us to deal with.
2311460	2314660	So do we have a problem with Islamophobia in this country?
2314660	2316700	Yes we do.
2316700	2321060	Do we have a problem with anti-Semitism in this country?
2321060	2322060	Yes we do.
2322060	2325540	Do we have a problem in this country with discrimination and hatred?
2325580	2328260	Yes we do.
2328260	2334900	And we need to talk about this and we need to challenge each other to be better on this.
2334900	2339260	We need to recognize that we still have a problem because there are men out there who
2339260	2343700	will not say, yes I am a feminist.
2343700	2351140	We need to recognize that saying and bringing forward truths that are uncomfortable to some
2351140	2356980	and challenge each other to shift our ways of thinking out of the easy ways we do.
2356980	2362940	To lay open wounds to sunshine and disinfectant.
2362940	2369940	That is also the role that we have in this house and that we have as active, engaged
2369940	2372140	citizens in this country.
2372140	2374620	We need to speak up.
2374620	2382980	The silent majority of good people in Canada who are not intolerant, who are not bigoted,
2382980	2387100	need to know they can be less silent.
2387100	2391540	We need to speak up for the things we believe in.
2391540	2396940	This house and every house across this country needs to be a reflection of that.
2396940	2398540	There are obvious problems here.
2398540	2403760	First, Trudeau makes the classic SJW mistake in conflating hate crimes with hate speech
2403760	2406360	or hateful thoughts or expressions of hate.
2406360	2408100	And no, they're not the same thing.
2408100	2410080	Words can never be violence.
2410080	2412660	Calling a black man a nigger is not violence.
2412660	2414320	It might make you a racist asshole.
2414320	2418280	It might make you somebody that I would never ever want to associate with, do business with
2418280	2419600	or whatever.
2419600	2421420	But it is not violent.
2421420	2423600	It's not the same as attacking a black man.
2423600	2427240	Not using a trans person's preferred pronouns is not a violent act.
2427240	2431520	Not liking Islam as a religion or a political philosophy is not a violent act.
2431520	2435200	You can't lump in all the hateful comments, all the racial slurs and whatever with the
2435200	2439600	number of actual attacks and claim, oh, Canada is so violent towards Muslims.
2439600	2440960	That's not how it works.
2440960	2444600	Secondly, Trudeau is right in labeling the Quebec mosque shooting a terrorist attack.
2444600	2449000	It didn't use explosives or airplanes, but it was a mass murder designed not only to
2449000	2452320	kill but to inspire terror within the affected communities.
2452320	2457080	And preventing these attacks, responding to these attacks, helping victims of these attacks
2457080	2461040	and seeing the perpetrators of these attacks brought to justice is absolutely the government's
2461040	2462040	job.
2462040	2464680	It is not the government's job to police the population for thought crime.
2464680	2468680	In conflating rhetoric with violence, Trudeau has taken on a task that will never, ever
2468680	2470080	be completed.
2470080	2474960	The government cannot wipe out racist ideas or attitudes or even speech within the population.
2474960	2478860	It can massively curtail human rights in order to get rid of some of it, sure.
2478860	2481360	But how far do you go before you consider the job done?
2481360	2486700	If your criteria, Justin, is to wipe out not only hateful actions, not only hateful speech,
2486700	2490680	but hateful attitudes and ideas, the job will never ever be done.
2490680	2494040	Even if there's not a shred of evidence that any hate exists.
2494040	2497820	This is the path to totalitarianism, and it's a far cry from what Trudeau used to say about
2497820	2521840	Stephen Harper's conduct as Prime Minister back in the day, too.
2521840	2524960	recently departed Sun News Network.
2524960	2531120	Their instincts are now to be suspicious of people who do not share their beliefs.
2531120	2536280	To harden divisions with people whose views differ from their own.
2536280	2541260	In my seven years in Parliament, I have heard the Conservative Prime Minister accuse two
2541260	2546520	different leaders of the NDP of sympathizing with terrorists.
2546520	2553560	The Conservative Party of Canada accuse notable Magillian Irwin-Kotler of anti-Semitism.
2553560	2558560	And the former Public Safety Minister to declare, you're either with us or you're with the
2558560	2561280	child pornographers.
2561280	2566600	For that particular effort, the Prime Minister eventually rewarded him with a judicial appointment.
2566600	2572760	This, my friends, is not your parents' Conservative Party.
2572760	2579680	Their approach to politics might work in the short term, but it is corrosive over time.
2579680	2584000	Especially in a diverse country like Canada.
2584000	2588440	It stokes anxiety and ferments fear.
2588440	2593800	Instead of encouraging Canadians to fight for one another's liberty, it tells us to
2593800	2598080	be suspicious of each other's choices.
2598120	2603160	Mr. Harper and I disagree fundamentally about a great many things.
2603160	2607560	But none, perhaps more so than this.
2607560	2612640	Leading this country should mean you bring Canadians together.
2612640	2616120	You do not divide them against one another.
2616120	2625880	Fear is a dangerous thing.
2625880	2631600	Once it is sanctioned by the state, there is no telling where it might lead.
2631600	2638000	It is always a short path to walk from being suspicious of our fellow citizens to taking
2638000	2641240	actions to restrict their liberty.
2641240	2645400	It's like I said at the beginning, candidate Trudeau is not the same man as Prime Minister
2645400	2646400	Trudeau.
2646400	2647400	Candidate Trudeau said,
2647400	2650920	Fear is a dangerous thing.
2650920	2656640	Once it is sanctioned by the state, there is no telling where it might lead.
2656640	2663060	It is always a short path to walk from being suspicious of our fellow citizens to taking
2663060	2666120	actions to restrict their liberty.
2666120	2667760	While Prime Minister Trudeau said,
2667760	2678720	M103 condemning Islamophobia actually gets people to notice that there are people uncomfortable
2678720	2685560	with that idea, that there are people who still have problems with the idea that we
2685560	2691040	would condemn discrimination against Muslims, then we have to know.
2691040	2694720	We have to expose that and we have to deal with it as a society.
2694720	2698760	Thirdly, this position of Trudeau's really makes his fervent claim of being a feminist
2698760	2699960	ring hollow, doesn't it?
2699960	2703480	I mean, Trudeau has no problem with shoehorning that shit in whenever he can.
2703480	2706960	Bringing up Gamergate like Zoe Quinn was an absolute angel.
2706960	2710000	My mom raised me to be a feminist.
2710000	2715440	My father raised me, he was of a different generation, but he raised me to respect and
2715440	2718160	defend everyone's rights.
2718160	2727400	And I deeply grounded my own identity in that, and I'm proud to say I'm a feminist.
2727400	2733840	And the things that we see online, whether it's issues like Gamergate and video games
2733840	2739960	and misogyny in popular culture, is something that we need people to stand clearly against.
2739960	2742000	Or while at a visit to the UN as well.
2742000	2750920	First of all, I'm going to keep saying loud and clearly that I am a feminist until, hear
2750920	2755520	me roar, until it is met with a shrug.
2755520	2757520	Or how about the world economic form?
2757520	2760880	Surely there's nothing else worth talking about there other than feminism, right?
2760880	2763760	By the way, we shouldn't be afraid of the word feminist.
2763760	2768160	Men and women should use it to describe themselves anytime they want.
2768160	2771440	But Trudeau has been caught out multiple times for placing Muslims on a higher tier than
2771440	2773080	women on the progressive stack.
2773080	2776440	For example, before he became prime minister, the Tory government decided to put forward
2776440	2781680	a motion condemning female genital mutilation, honour killings, and forced marriage as barbaric.
2781680	2785320	And Justin Trudeau objected on the grounds that using the word barbaric to describe other
2785320	2786960	cultures was racist.
2786960	2790720	He later apologized, presumably because at this point he had little political power,
2790720	2793320	but I don't think his opinions actually changed too much.
2793320	2794320	Why?
2794320	2798440	Because Trudeau, as prime minister, has had no problem attending events at Canadian mosques
2798440	2802040	where the non-Muslim women who were with him were forced to wear headscarves, enter
2802040	2822800	and leave through side doors, and sit on isolated balconies or off to the side away from men.
2822800	2827120	When you're a social justice warrior or a regressive leftist, a minority religion practiced
2827120	2831720	primarily by racially minority individuals on the one hand, and feminism and women's
2831720	2835120	rights on the other hand, which one do you ultimately choose?
2835120	2839760	Well, look at the face of Ontario's Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne, and you get your answer.
2839760	2843840	And although I don't really like the Canadian-based right-leaning news outlet The Rebel, they
2843840	2847420	were still the only ones actually willing to hold Trudeau's feet to the fire on this
2847420	2848420	issue.
2848420	2852000	Prime Minister, it's about the event you attended yesterday in the morning, and some
2852000	2856760	progressive, what I guess I would call progressive feminists, who very much support your work
2856760	2861280	for gender equality and very admiring of that work, were disappointed that you attended
2861280	2863360	a gender-segregated event.
2863360	2868120	And so I guess my question would be, how do you reconcile your brand as a self-styled
2868120	2873440	feminist prime minister with attendance at a gender-segregated event?
2873440	2875620	Look at the balls on this guy.
2875620	2878940	Are any left-leaning news organizations going to stand up here?
2878940	2881040	Any feminist academics or writers?
2881040	2882040	Any at all?
2882040	2885520	Is it going to yet again be the job of the Conservatives to make a principled stand for
2885520	2888680	women's rights, gay rights, human rights against Islam?
2888680	2891260	Just like in the US, the UK, France, and elsewhere?
2891260	2895120	Are there any liberal politicians left in the fucking world willing to look beyond somebody's
2895120	2899740	race or religion or gender and say, your human rights abuses are unacceptable, and your culture,
2899740	2903120	your religion, and your ideology don't excuse that fact?
2903120	2912120	The fact is, the values that define Canada include respect and openness towards our full
2912120	2913120	diversity.
2913720	2917800	Understanding that diversity is a source of strength, not a source of weakness, is why
2917800	2924280	I think that politicians need to be focused on bringing people together rather than fomenting
2924280	2925280	divisions.
2925280	2931720	And that's why I am happy to attend community events in churches, temples, synagogues, mosques.
2931720	2938360	I'm happy to engage with Canadians where they are and talk about the full range of
2938360	2941800	opportunities that we're working hard to create.
2941800	2951840	Yeah, yeah, Justin, you're not on the campaign trail anymore.
2951840	2955640	Robotically regurgitating talking points like Marco Rubio's assertion that Barack Obama
2955640	2960440	knows exactly what he's doing does not answer the fucking question.
2960440	2963160	I'm somebody who has never voted Conservative in my life.
2963160	2967400	And I grew up with the general idea, as did many others my age, that the Liberals and
2967400	2972240	the NDP generally had the backs of average Canadians on social issues, even if they were
2972240	2974080	hit and miss economically.
2974080	2978600	This was something I actually discussed with ScrumpMonkey, or El Scrumpo on Twitter, on
2978600	2982880	a call recently, and that discussion helped me form a hypothesis regarding liberal abandonment
2982880	2985340	of the left, in both Canada and elsewhere.
2985340	2989000	When I first became politically knowledgeable on even the most basic level, I was about
2989000	2990000	eight years old.
2990000	2992880	Yes, I am the predecessor to the woke eight-year-old.
2992880	2993880	Though not really.
2993880	2997680	At that time, I knew who the Prime Minister of Canada was, Jean Chretien.
2997680	3000560	I knew that he led the Liberal Party, and I knew that the Conservative Party was in
3000560	3001560	opposition to him.
3001560	3004800	I knew that he had a stroke that caused one side of his face to droop, and I knew that
3004800	3008000	he made light of it by saying that he didn't talk out of both sides of his mouth.
3008000	3011840	And as I grew older, my knowledge of politics also naturally grew.
3011840	3015320	In high school, I remember holding the opinion that gay marriage should be legal.
3015320	3018480	And I remember being considered a radical at that time for that position.
3018480	3022520	I remember the fervor when gay marriage did actually become legal in 2003.
3022520	3026840	And in that call with Scrump, we sat down and did a very brief look over at the major
3026840	3029440	notable achievements of Prime Ministers of my time.
3029440	3030880	Mulroney, Conservative.
3030880	3033160	Privatization of several Crown Corporations.
3033160	3034240	NAFTA.
3034240	3035560	Support in the First Gulf War.
3035560	3037140	Campbell, Conservative.
3037140	3038640	First female Prime Minister.
3038640	3042720	Mulroney bailed out of the party when he became unpopular, dumping all the problems on her.

3074360	3075920	Trudeau, Liberal.
3075920	3077320	His father's good name.
3077320	3081600	Though both Liberal and Tory Prime Ministers have had both good and bad accomplishments,
3081600	3085440	at a cursory glance, it seems like the Liberals have done more good and the Tories have done
3085440	3086440	more bad.
3086440	3089400	The Liberals have acted more in accordance with civil liberties and the Tories have acted
3089400	3091360	more in accordance with corporate interests.
3091360	3095440	But America's third way corporatist democratic policies have come to Canada, full swing,
3095440	3096560	with Justin Trudeau.
3096560	3100020	And for a lot of young Liberals, hell, for a lot of middle-aged Liberals who are looking
3100020	3103920	for a left-leaning party willing to take a stand against human rights abuses, even if
3103920	3108160	those abuses come from racial or religious minorities, they are no longer seeing any
3108160	3110160	champions within the Liberal Party.
3110160	3114600	That said, Trudeau is content to call you a racist, a sexist, and an Islamophobe, all
3114600	3118680	the while pursuing economic policies ranging between dysfunctional to corporatists, with
3118680	3120980	no room for the Canadian citizen in between.
3120980	3124420	This is the reason why Liberals are abandoning left-leaning parties in the UK.
3124420	3127480	This is the reason why Liberals abandon Hillary in the US.
3127480	3131600	And in my opinion, if an election were called today, this is the reason why Trudeau's
3131600	3133880	Liberal Party would find itself in serious trouble.
3133880	3138880	And it's also why the radical left protest group, Antifa, spray-paints Liberals get the
3138880	3139880	bullet too.
3139880	3140960	It's not racism.
3140960	3142180	It's not sexism.
3142180	3143600	It's not Islamophobia.
3143600	3144880	It's not homophobia.
3144880	3148880	It's because curtailing personal freedom and liberty is explicitly what liberalism fights
3148880	3153340	against, even when Canada's quote-unquote Liberal Party wants to do it.
3153340	3158480	As for Trudeau himself, I think the pressure of his father's legacy, plus finally managing
3158480	3163060	to grasp real power, has fundamentally changed the man into somebody his younger self would
3163060	3164360	have found bitter disappointment in.
3164360	3182360	I
3182360	3186960	know he was only 18 here, but this Trudeau is somebody willing to say something unpopular
3186960	3188200	because he thought it was right.
3188200	3192680	He was fighting against a Quebec independence referendum, a very popular independence referendum,
3192680	3193680	while living in Montreal.
3194000	3197440	Maybe this is an instance where he didn't completely get wiser as he got older.
3197440	3200800	Trudeau also once said that he found the large numbers of people turning to him for potential
3200800	3204080	party leadership solely because of his family name to be unsettling.
3204080	3205080	What happened to that Trudeau?
3205080	3206180	Where did he go?
3206180	3208200	He once completely rejected identity politics.
3208200	3214380	I'll make the case that Canadian liberty has got one of the world's most vexatious
3214380	3216060	problems right.
3216060	3222420	The interplay between individual freedom and collective identity.
3222420	3227960	We understand that people are defined both by the things that unite us and distinguish
3227960	3237340	us from one another, languages, cultures, faiths, even, importantly, gender and sexual
3237340	3238900	orientation.
3238900	3247420	However, we also know that all of these contribute to a person's identity but don't define
3247420	3248840	it.
3248840	3255040	These things all find their highest, most concrete expression in the individual human
3255040	3257560	beings who embody them.
3257560	3259040	What happened to that Trudeau?
3259040	3262360	What happened to the Trudeau that would have been horrified at praising Fidel Castro upon
3262360	3263600	the dictator's death?
3263600	3265640	What happened to the Trudeau that said this?
3265640	3268120	Our politics are supposed to be retail these days.
3268120	3275560	We're expected to talk about very specific measures targeted at key audiences and swing
3275560	3281400	voters, especially in an election year.
3281400	3283720	But I have an old-fashioned view.
3283720	3290080	I think policies are concrete expressions of values.
3290080	3294920	Priorities are important.
3294920	3297840	Specific commitments are important.
3297840	3302200	But there is no way to predict the events you will have to navigate during your time
3302200	3308440	in office, let alone the measures that will be required to manage those events.
3308440	3311260	People aren't naive, they know that.
3311260	3317600	So Canadians ought to know what core values motivate their leaders' decisions, whatever
3317600	3319640	events may throw at them.
3319640	3324160	If policies are expressions of values, Justin, what values can we say that you hold?
3324160	3327800	Ah well, at least he kept his promise to legalize weed, you guys.
3327800	3331800	2018, here we come.
