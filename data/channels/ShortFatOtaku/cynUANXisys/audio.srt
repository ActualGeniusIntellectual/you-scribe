1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,600
Like the last few videos I've done, this video is a direct sequel to a previous one.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:16,240
This time, my previous video on legal euthanasia in Canada, dubbed MADE, or medical assistance

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,240
in dying.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,320
Go back and watch that video before watching this one.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,360
I know I say that a lot, but I really mean it this time.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,200
There's too much evidence in that video to pack into a TLDR.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,320
Last time, I showed you not only the high-profile examples in the Canadian media of people with

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,600
injuries or illnesses being inappropriately pushed towards euthanasia, but also circumstantial,

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,880
though not conclusive, evidence that the judges who presided over the lawsuits that eventually

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,160
made euthanasia legal in Canada may have been heavily biased.

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,160
See?

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,440
I can't just prove that in a quick TLDR.

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,160
You gotta go watch a previous video.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,600
The issue has blown up massively here in Canada since I've last spoken about it, becoming

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,680
enough of a shitshow that the rest of the world has begun to take notice.

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,920
Most of the time, Canada's pretty unassuming, and you'll like it that way.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,760
I've never seen a Prime Minister have so many obvious failures to draw the attention

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,440
of the international community to our little backwater country this much between the trucker

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,360
protests and now euthanasia, and it's actually amazing to see just how incompetent he actually

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,360
is.

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,160
One of the reasons it's blown up is because stories just keep coming out of people being

22
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,200
inappropriately offered euthanasia.

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,400
The biggest one recently is of a Canadian Paralympian who lost her legs while serving

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,520
in the Canadian army.

25
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,720
She needed a stair lift to travel between the floors of her house, and when she complained

26
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,720
to the government about not getting one, they offered her euthanasia as a replacement

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,720
solution.

28
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,840
This sort of thing has led to a bunch of funny memes, where the once internationally held

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,300
in high regard Canadian healthcare has been reduced to a joke, a system where doctors

30
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,320
would rather prescribe death than perform the most basic medicine.

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,320
And hey, I'm not offended.

32
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,680
I love me some dark humor, but Jesus Christ, this is a situation that we have to fix.

33
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,420
This commercial went viral like a day or two after I published my last euthanasia video.

34
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,440
Good timing on that.

35
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
Check this out.

36
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Oh hey, would you look at that.

37
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,860
The first commercial in I don't know how long that only features white people.

38
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,760
No diversity at all, and it's all about killing yourself.

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,520
Yeah, the romanticization of euthanasia happening right now is pretty grotesque.

40
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,500
Let me offer you a bit of context though.

41
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,880
At the end when it says Simons, that is a Canadian fashion brand.

42
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,340
It's well known here, but you don't see it outside of Canada really.

43
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,120
You know how, sometimes when the cause that is considered an exceptional social good comes

44
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,000
up like Black Lives Matter or the Ukraine war or mask mandates or something like that,

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,920
you'll see American companies run advertisements showing their support for that cause.

46
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,320
They don't actually advertise their products.

47
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,160
They just make a 30 second spot that appears to be emotionally powerful or whatever in

48
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,760
order to spread awareness of the current thing and slap their logo at the end of it so that

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,520
you know they believe in what's currently socially acceptable.

50
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,320
That's what this commercial is for Canada, but it's for legal euthanasia.

51
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,120
The most disgusting part of the story though is that after the death of the woman featured

52
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,280
in the commercial, it came out that she actually wanted to live.

53
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,240
The woman featured in a glamorous pro-euthanasia commercial for a Canadian clothing retailer

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,440
only opted for assisted suicide after her years-long attempts to secure proper health

55
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
care failed.

56
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,780
She was left without primary care after her family doctor moved away.

57
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,020
And so, after her Ehlers-Danlos diagnosis 10 years ago, her treatment had largely consisted

58
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,240
of a chaotic and ineffective stream of specialist appointments, none of whom had any background

59
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,240
in her condition.

60
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,920
I feel like I'm falling through the cracks, so if I'm not able to access health care,

61
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,220
am I then able to access death care?

62
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,860
And that's what led me to look into MADE.

63
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,520
It is far easier to let go than keep fighting.

64
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,860
The British Columbian health care system had been unable to provide her with the care she

65
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,020
needed, but they rapidly approved her application for euthanasia.

66
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,060
And she's not the only one.

67
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,460
The majority of examples I provided last time were of people who didn't actually want

68
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,020
to die, but for whom the government was refusing to care for adequately.

69
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:08,260
A recent example is of Les Landry, who directly says that poverty is why he's choosing to

70
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,260
die.

71
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,460
The two-doctor approval system I described in the previous video, where there's strict

72
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:17,060
rules on what a doctor can approve euthanasia for, seems to have entirely broken down.

73
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,980
As Landry provided to the media an email where he directly states that being poor is why

74
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,980
he's doing this.

75
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,220
And the reply is, yep, all good, let's go.

76
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,420
Just a few days ago, a journalist, Alexander Rakin, blew the cover off of why this whole

77
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,480
thing is happening, in his article for The New Atlantic, No Other Options.

78
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,800
He makes the same observation that I did, the stunning number of stories coming out

79
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,340
over the past few months showing abuse of the Canadian euthanasia program.

80
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,060
He brought it up with one of Canada's most prolific euthanasia providers, Stephanie Green,

81
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,980
who claims, alongside other supporters, that the worries are being purposefully blown up

82
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,940
by a sensationalist press, that the stories aren't being accurately reported on, and

83
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,380
that the safeguards preventing abuse of the system are in place and working.

84
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,420
Rakin claims that the CAMAP, the Canadian Association of Made Assessors and Providers,

85
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,120
which is not a government entity, but rather a pro-euthanasia activist group run by Stephanie

86
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,020
Green herself, has sat on evidence showing that people who choose euthanasia do so because

87
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,980
they're poor or they have debt or they're getting evicted, and that illness is simply

88
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,700
a pretense for a lot of people.

89
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,900
CAMAP holds online seminars for euthanasia providers to help instruct medical staff in

90
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,900
the process.

91
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,900
One topic that came up was what should be done about poor people who come to them.

92
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:31,940
When the Supreme Court decision came down in 2015 or 2016, and it evidently omitted

93
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,740
the need that somebody be at the end of life.

94
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:45,420
My first thought as an OT back then was, this could be an extraordinary lever to improve

95
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:50,940
social supports in this country if we can gather the stories of people who would opt

96
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,300
to die because the social supports are so poor.

97
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:01,620
I have long hoped to get a funding grant together to try to do that.

98
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:16,060
In case you didn't catch that, Kevin Reel, a senior medical ethicist at Sunnybrook Hospital

99
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,160
in Toronto and the former president of the Canadian Bioethics Society, is speaking about

100
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,300
euthanasia as if it's a given that they'll be killing poor people because they're poor,

101
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,620
and is hoping to use their deaths in a political manner to massively expand the social welfare

102
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,880
state in Canada.

103
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,560
During the same meeting, they go over the various cases of people who have been euthanized,

104
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,840
and one of the examples is of a 55-year-old woman who identified poverty as the primary

105
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,380
reason for her request.

106
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,920
Mary is very clear that she wants to live.

107
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:50,240
She does not want to die, but she's suffering terribly, and she's been maxing out her credit

108
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
cards.

109
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,040
She has no other options, and she's very clear that as the suffering increases, she will

110
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,780
have to access aid.

111
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,760
My work with Mary suggests to me that there's not a lot of other extra resource we can offer

112
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:14,480
her that she has not already very carefully and thoughtfully exhausted on her own.

113
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,480
So Mary is one example.

114
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,040
Reagan goes into other examples in the article, of people who have medical problems, but whose

115
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,000
main reason to kill themselves is related to money.

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,520
One person is a 38-year-old trans woman who has her college tuition fully funded but wanted

117
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,040
euthanasia because she lives in a one-room studio apartment and there are creepy guys

118
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,680
who also live in the same building.

119
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,240
The K-MAP recordings show us that despite Justin Trudeau's public exclamation that

120
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,400
nobody would be euthanized due to a lack of support, and despite the legal safeguards

121
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,360
that are apparently in place to prevent abuse of the system, nobody actually cares.

122
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,840
It's happening anyway, and nobody in the K-MAP meetings express shock or surprise that

123
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
this is going on.

124
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,360
None of them ask if they should stop or re-evaluate what they're doing.

125
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,680
None of them even seem to recognize this is a problem.

126
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,000
Their only response is one, talking about how to teach euthanasia providers to deal

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,680
with the moral ramifications of what they're doing, and two, talking about how the rising

128
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,760
death count is going to be useful as a political bludgeon.

129
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,420
And the program's expanding!

130
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,680
Current on-the-table plans are that by March of 2023, euthanasia will be available to people

131
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
with mental illness.

132
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,040
In other words, if you're depressed and want to kill yourself, don't worry about

133
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
it.

134
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
Let the government do it instead.

135
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:29,960
Now, I can see the point here.

136
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,400
Sometimes kids are born with conditions that they just won't recover from.

137
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,840
But considering how this program is going so far, I don't trust the Canadian government

138
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,400
to make a determination between a newborn who will live for three painful months and

139
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,320
then inevitably die, and a post-partum mom who just wants her kid dead.

140
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,720
In contrast to Stephanie Green's statement that euthanasia in Canada is working fine,

141
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,720
another euthanasia provider, Madeleine Lee, testified to Parliament that the safeguards

142
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,520
to prevent abuse aren't working.

143
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,400
I'm a psychiatrist at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, an associate professor at the

144
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,080
University of Toronto, and a scientist with a research focus on emotional distress and

145
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,480
suicide and cancer, and this includes MADE research.

146
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,880
I led the development of the MADE program for the University Health Network, served

147
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,040
as an expert witness on the Lamb case, and am currently the scientific lead for CAMAP's

148
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,320
MADE curriculum development project.

149
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,480
And what I'd like to tell you today is that I have significant concerns about the pace

150
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,300
and process of the expanding MADE legislation.

151
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:30,440
I've yet to see a public opinion poll on whether the Canadian populace is in favour of MADE

152
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,140
for all forms of life suffering, and in particular for psychosocial or structural vulnerability.

153
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,440
It's an important question because I believe the Canadian populace, and maybe even the

154
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,280
legislators, are not aware of who has been qualifying for MADE.

155
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,480
I've certainly had cases where I felt compelled to provide MADE against my better clinical

156
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,800
judgement because the law did not adequately protect.

157
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,360
The current legislation leaves too much responsibility in the hands of clinicians, whose application

158
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,340
of the eligibility criteria according to their own values can render the legislated safeguards

159
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,760
impotent.

160
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,000
Also as was said earlier, this is because incurability can include treatment refusal,

161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,200
an advanced state of decline may not need to be progressive, suffering is determined

162
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,080
only subjectively, and reasonably foreseeable is not legally defined at all.

163
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:25,040
The absence of a definition of RFND is crucial in light of C7, as patients with prognosis

164
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,640
of several years, or who refuse preventive care, or who voluntarily stop eating and drinking,

165
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,040
can be placed on the supposedly palliative track 1, where there's no longer even the

166
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,980
mandatory safeguard of a 10-day reflection period.

167
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,060
The two-doctor requirement seems to be no safeguard at all, considering there are groups

168
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,940
like Dying with Dignity Canada who keep a record of euthanasia activists who are also

169
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,240
legally empowered to provide the service.

170
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,620
One of the examples given during the KMAP meetings is of a man who clearly didn't

171
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,060
qualify for euthanasia, who was not even of sound mind enough to make the decision, but

172
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:03,600
who, through Dying with Dignity Canada, was put in touch with Ellen Weeb, a euthanasia

173
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,760
advocate in Vancouver who would do the deed anyway.

174
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,640
She got one of her friends to sign off, he flew to Vancouver, and they ended his life.

175
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,580
Jocelyn Downey, one of the lawyers that worked on the court case to make euthanasia legal

176
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,640
in Canada, has stated during the KMAP recordings that you can just keep asking doctors until

177
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,160
you get the two that you require.

178
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,580
I would also say we need to remember that disagreement doesn't mean you must stop.

179
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,400
Disagreement amongst colleagues.

180
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,860
The law says you must be of the opinion.

181
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,860
That is the standard.

182
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,180
The standard is not everyone has to agree with you, it is you have to be of the opinion.

183
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,040
The standard in the law is that you must exercise reasonable knowledge, care, and skill.

184
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,720
The standard in the law is that you can have a reasonable but mistaken belief about something

185
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,760
and still not be in trouble with the law.

186
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,180
There is no certainty or unanimity required, there is not perfection required.

187
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:02,160
So people can face disagreement from colleagues and staff, colleagues, sorry, and still proceed.

188
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,940
The end result of this is that there are many paths available to reach the end, and you

189
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,700
only need to find one.

190
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,380
The system makes it easy to die.

191
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,380
And patients know this too.

192
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,160
There is a psychiatrist, John Mayer, who testified to parliament that he's had patients who

193
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,400
could actually get better but who have actively chosen to let themselves deteriorate until

194
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,460
they are eligible for euthanasia because they know just how permissible the medical system

195
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,080
is and how it views people like them.

196
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,440
And none of this matters because the legal system isn't actually prosecuting people

197
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,320
who violate these tissue paper safeguards.

198
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,880
According to one of the rare investigations into a euthanasia case, the police admitted

199
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,060
that this type of investigation is exceptionally rare, rare enough that there's no records

200
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,060
on it.

201
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,260
That might point to the fact that things are actually just fine, that true violations are

202
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,840
happening exceptionally rarely.

203
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,720
However, the director of disability studies at the University of Manitoba, Nancy Hansen,

204
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,640
has stated that due to the way the law is written, there is no legal consequence for

205
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,000
non-compliance.

206
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,400
The people who do the training on how to administer euthanasia, the people who do the assessments

207
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,640
on who qualifies, the people who review the system and look into potential abuses of it,

208
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,360
and the people who provide the public face, they're all the same people, and they're

209
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,920
all multi-decade long pro-euthanasia activists.

210
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:30,920
Listen to Weeb again.

211
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,600
Does this sound like somebody who is open to criticism of their system, who takes abuses

212
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,040
of the system seriously?

213
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
Of course not.

214
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,160
She is one of the architects, and to her, it's working exactly as intended.

215
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,880
The most recent story on this topic is from yesterday, where a booklet aimed towards children

216
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
was published.

217
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,480
Don't worry, this isn't to propagandize kids into killing themselves, but it's still pretty

218
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
ghoulish.

219
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,840
It's a pamphlet made to be child-friendly to explain what euthanasia is and why it's necessary

220
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,620
for the young relatives of people who have opted to kill themselves.

221
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,400
It's another step on the normalization of this practice, which has been moving ahead

222
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,880
full speed, expanding rapidly and constantly, with no regard for the obvious problems that

223
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
it's causing.

224
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,920
Even for someone like me, who thinks that you do ultimately have the right to end your

225
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,120
own life, there's a clear problem here.

226
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,280
It's one thing if you decide to kill yourself on your own as a personal choice.

227
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,760
It's another thing entirely to have a government apparatus built to quickly usher you towards

228
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,420
your death the minute your care becomes too costly for the state to afford.

229
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,600
And in a public healthcare system, where the state is the payer and or provider of healthcare,

230
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,160
there is an extremely serious responsibility on the state to not simply kill people for

231
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,400
bureaucratic efficiency, and in my opinion, that is exactly where Canada is failing right

232
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
now.

233
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,040
Thankfully, due to all this high-profile talk, pushback has begun.

234
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,720
The cabinet minister, in charge of Veterans Affairs Canada, flip-flopped a bit, testifying

235
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,040
to parliament that they did indeed inappropriately offer euthanasia, and then later publicly

236
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,400
said on Twitter that they didn't.

237
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,420
However, investigations have shown that it was one rogue individual within the VAC who

238
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,800
did it, and they've been fired.

239
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,880
The plans to expand euthanasia in March of 2023, for those with medical illnesses, is

240
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,080
being challenged in parliament, though only to the point that the opposition is asking

241
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,200
for a delay.

242
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,440
It does feel like the tide is slowly turning, though.

243
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,120
Canadian public opinion on euthanasia has generally been positive, but only when considered

244
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,120
as a last resort.

245
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,120
There's no new polls since all the news came out that I can find, but I can't imagine

246
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,600
people still being okay with it after learning about what's actually been going on.

247
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,160
Of course, there's a few crazies out there who are taking their objections to the extreme,

248
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
like this guy.

249
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,480
So I guess in March, Canada will be expanding made to include mental illness.

250
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,500
Now Google vaccine hesitancy as a mental illness.

251
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,680
Are you getting it yet?

252
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,680
Well, alright.

253
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,640
You Google vaccine hesitancy as a mental illness, you get a bunch of anti-vax pages claiming

254
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,840
that it's happening, but no one actually doing that.

255
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,280
Also, you find your own tweet.

256
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,880
Also, you know that made is still ultimately a voluntary program, right?

257
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,440
For all of its problems, and there are many, they all require people to sign up for their

258
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
own volition.

259
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,520
And I don't know about you, but I have no intention of ever signing, no matter how

260
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,520
bad it gets.

261
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,920
We can object to what's actually going on, without inventing these doomsday scenarios,

262
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
alright?

263
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,840
The reality is bad enough, we don't need this fiction.

264
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,600
And also, I intend to be an obstinate old thorn in everyone's side for as long as

265
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
I can.

266
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,280
In fact, if this is the way our society is going to go, I think you have a moral obligation

267
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
to.

268
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
Look back at that Simon's commercial.

269
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,800
All the propaganda around euthanasia emphasizes how beautiful your death will be.

270
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,520
Even that one clip I used in the last video had the nurse saying something like, suicide

271
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
doesn't have to be dramatic.

272
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:33,720
Now, I'm not advising anyone to do anything, in fact I'm saying explicitly don't kill

273
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
yourself, guys.

274
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,000
You know how there's those hyper-masculine twitter accounts that talk about returning

275
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,320
to tradition, and how young boys are being medicated because they can't sit still in

276
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,000
classrooms because their biology has them hardwired to be throwing a spear through the

277
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,880
heart of a leaping antelope or whatever the fuck?

278
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,240
A lot of those are pretty cringe, but there is certainly at least a little drop of truth

279
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,240
in there.

280
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,760
After all, a common male fantasy to die heroically while defending friends or stopping a shooter

281
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,840
or covering your partner or something like that.

282
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,240
That doesn't mean that these men have suicidal ideations, they're not desperately looking

283
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,240
for a way out ASAP.

284
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,280
What it does mean is, if I've got to die, you know, that would be a pretty good way

285
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
to go.

286
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,240
I wouldn't be happy that I'm dying, but I would be satisfied if my death meant something.

287
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,000
Compare that ethic to Canada's euthanasia scheme.

288
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,080
My death is an honorable one that helps the people I care about, versus my death is a

289
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,080
beautiful one.

290
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,200
At least that's what state bureaucrats tell me in order to get me to brush myself

291
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
aside for their benefit.

292
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,720
I don't know about you, but when I hear that nurse saying that it doesn't have to

293
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:32,720
be dramatic, I actually think to myself, yeah, it does, it has to mean something if

294
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
I'm going to choose it.

295
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,200
I'm not going to peacefully go into the euthanasia pod or whatever.

296
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,640
If I'm going to die, it's not going to be for the benefit of the government.

297
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,640
And right up until the last second I go, I'm going to be a pain in the neck for everyone.

298
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,800
Because fuck every single person who thinks that this shit is acceptable.
