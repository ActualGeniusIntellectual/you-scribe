WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.600
Like the last few videos I've done, this video is a direct sequel to a previous one.

00:10.600 --> 00:16.240
This time, my previous video on legal euthanasia in Canada, dubbed MADE, or medical assistance

00:16.240 --> 00:17.240
in dying.

00:17.240 --> 00:19.320
Go back and watch that video before watching this one.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.360
I know I say that a lot, but I really mean it this time.

00:21.360 --> 00:25.200
There's too much evidence in that video to pack into a TLDR.

00:25.200 --> 00:29.320
Last time, I showed you not only the high-profile examples in the Canadian media of people with

00:29.320 --> 00:34.600
injuries or illnesses being inappropriately pushed towards euthanasia, but also circumstantial,

00:34.600 --> 00:38.880
though not conclusive, evidence that the judges who presided over the lawsuits that eventually

00:38.880 --> 00:42.160
made euthanasia legal in Canada may have been heavily biased.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.160
See?

00:43.160 --> 00:44.440
I can't just prove that in a quick TLDR.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.160
You gotta go watch a previous video.

00:46.160 --> 00:50.600
The issue has blown up massively here in Canada since I've last spoken about it, becoming

00:50.600 --> 00:53.680
enough of a shitshow that the rest of the world has begun to take notice.

00:53.680 --> 00:55.920
Most of the time, Canada's pretty unassuming, and you'll like it that way.

00:55.920 --> 00:59.760
I've never seen a Prime Minister have so many obvious failures to draw the attention

00:59.760 --> 01:03.440
of the international community to our little backwater country this much between the trucker

01:03.440 --> 01:08.360
protests and now euthanasia, and it's actually amazing to see just how incompetent he actually

01:08.360 --> 01:09.360
is.

01:09.360 --> 01:13.160
One of the reasons it's blown up is because stories just keep coming out of people being

01:13.160 --> 01:15.200
inappropriately offered euthanasia.

01:15.200 --> 01:19.400
The biggest one recently is of a Canadian Paralympian who lost her legs while serving

01:19.400 --> 01:20.520
in the Canadian army.

01:20.520 --> 01:23.720
She needed a stair lift to travel between the floors of her house, and when she complained

01:23.720 --> 01:27.720
to the government about not getting one, they offered her euthanasia as a replacement

01:27.720 --> 01:28.720
solution.

01:28.720 --> 01:32.840
This sort of thing has led to a bunch of funny memes, where the once internationally held

01:32.840 --> 01:37.300
in high regard Canadian healthcare has been reduced to a joke, a system where doctors

01:37.300 --> 01:40.320
would rather prescribe death than perform the most basic medicine.

01:40.320 --> 01:41.320
And hey, I'm not offended.

01:41.320 --> 01:45.680
I love me some dark humor, but Jesus Christ, this is a situation that we have to fix.

01:45.680 --> 01:50.420
This commercial went viral like a day or two after I published my last euthanasia video.

01:50.420 --> 01:51.440
Good timing on that.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.440
Check this out.

02:22.440 --> 02:23.440
Oh hey, would you look at that.

02:23.440 --> 02:26.860
The first commercial in I don't know how long that only features white people.

02:26.860 --> 02:29.760
No diversity at all, and it's all about killing yourself.

02:29.760 --> 02:33.520
Yeah, the romanticization of euthanasia happening right now is pretty grotesque.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.500
Let me offer you a bit of context though.

02:35.500 --> 02:38.880
At the end when it says Simons, that is a Canadian fashion brand.

02:38.880 --> 02:41.340
It's well known here, but you don't see it outside of Canada really.

02:41.340 --> 02:45.120
You know how, sometimes when the cause that is considered an exceptional social good comes

02:45.120 --> 02:49.000
up like Black Lives Matter or the Ukraine war or mask mandates or something like that,

02:49.000 --> 02:52.920
you'll see American companies run advertisements showing their support for that cause.

02:52.920 --> 02:54.320
They don't actually advertise their products.

02:54.320 --> 02:58.160
They just make a 30 second spot that appears to be emotionally powerful or whatever in

02:58.160 --> 03:01.760
order to spread awareness of the current thing and slap their logo at the end of it so that

03:01.760 --> 03:04.520
you know they believe in what's currently socially acceptable.

03:04.520 --> 03:08.320
That's what this commercial is for Canada, but it's for legal euthanasia.

03:08.320 --> 03:12.120
The most disgusting part of the story though is that after the death of the woman featured

03:12.120 --> 03:15.280
in the commercial, it came out that she actually wanted to live.

03:15.280 --> 03:19.240
The woman featured in a glamorous pro-euthanasia commercial for a Canadian clothing retailer

03:19.240 --> 03:23.440
only opted for assisted suicide after her years-long attempts to secure proper health

03:23.440 --> 03:24.440
care failed.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.780
She was left without primary care after her family doctor moved away.

03:27.780 --> 03:33.020
And so, after her Ehlers-Danlos diagnosis 10 years ago, her treatment had largely consisted

03:33.020 --> 03:37.240
of a chaotic and ineffective stream of specialist appointments, none of whom had any background

03:37.240 --> 03:38.240
in her condition.

03:38.240 --> 03:41.920
I feel like I'm falling through the cracks, so if I'm not able to access health care,

03:41.920 --> 03:44.220
am I then able to access death care?

03:44.220 --> 03:45.860
And that's what led me to look into MADE.

03:45.860 --> 03:48.520
It is far easier to let go than keep fighting.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.860
The British Columbian health care system had been unable to provide her with the care she

03:51.860 --> 03:55.020
needed, but they rapidly approved her application for euthanasia.

03:55.020 --> 03:56.060
And she's not the only one.

03:56.060 --> 03:59.460
The majority of examples I provided last time were of people who didn't actually want

03:59.460 --> 04:03.020
to die, but for whom the government was refusing to care for adequately.

04:03.020 --> 04:08.260
A recent example is of Les Landry, who directly says that poverty is why he's choosing to

04:08.260 --> 04:09.260
die.

04:09.260 --> 04:12.460
The two-doctor approval system I described in the previous video, where there's strict

04:12.460 --> 04:17.060
rules on what a doctor can approve euthanasia for, seems to have entirely broken down.

04:17.060 --> 04:21.980
As Landry provided to the media an email where he directly states that being poor is why

04:21.980 --> 04:22.980
he's doing this.

04:22.980 --> 04:25.220
And the reply is, yep, all good, let's go.

04:25.220 --> 04:29.420
Just a few days ago, a journalist, Alexander Rakin, blew the cover off of why this whole

04:29.420 --> 04:33.480
thing is happening, in his article for The New Atlantic, No Other Options.

04:33.480 --> 04:36.800
He makes the same observation that I did, the stunning number of stories coming out

04:36.800 --> 04:40.340
over the past few months showing abuse of the Canadian euthanasia program.

04:40.340 --> 04:44.060
He brought it up with one of Canada's most prolific euthanasia providers, Stephanie Green,

04:44.060 --> 04:47.980
who claims, alongside other supporters, that the worries are being purposefully blown up

04:47.980 --> 04:51.940
by a sensationalist press, that the stories aren't being accurately reported on, and

04:51.940 --> 04:55.380
that the safeguards preventing abuse of the system are in place and working.

04:55.380 --> 05:00.420
Rakin claims that the CAMAP, the Canadian Association of Made Assessors and Providers,

05:00.420 --> 05:05.120
which is not a government entity, but rather a pro-euthanasia activist group run by Stephanie

05:05.120 --> 05:10.020
Green herself, has sat on evidence showing that people who choose euthanasia do so because

05:10.020 --> 05:13.980
they're poor or they have debt or they're getting evicted, and that illness is simply

05:13.980 --> 05:15.700
a pretense for a lot of people.

05:15.700 --> 05:19.900
CAMAP holds online seminars for euthanasia providers to help instruct medical staff in

05:19.900 --> 05:20.900
the process.

05:20.900 --> 05:24.900
One topic that came up was what should be done about poor people who come to them.

05:24.900 --> 05:31.940
When the Supreme Court decision came down in 2015 or 2016, and it evidently omitted

05:31.940 --> 05:35.740
the need that somebody be at the end of life.

05:35.740 --> 05:45.420
My first thought as an OT back then was, this could be an extraordinary lever to improve

05:45.420 --> 05:50.940
social supports in this country if we can gather the stories of people who would opt

05:50.940 --> 05:55.300
to die because the social supports are so poor.

05:55.300 --> 06:01.620
I have long hoped to get a funding grant together to try to do that.

06:01.620 --> 06:16.060
In case you didn't catch that, Kevin Reel, a senior medical ethicist at Sunnybrook Hospital

06:16.060 --> 06:20.160
in Toronto and the former president of the Canadian Bioethics Society, is speaking about

06:20.160 --> 06:24.300
euthanasia as if it's a given that they'll be killing poor people because they're poor,

06:24.300 --> 06:28.620
and is hoping to use their deaths in a political manner to massively expand the social welfare

06:28.620 --> 06:29.880
state in Canada.

06:29.880 --> 06:33.560
During the same meeting, they go over the various cases of people who have been euthanized,

06:33.560 --> 06:37.840
and one of the examples is of a 55-year-old woman who identified poverty as the primary

06:37.840 --> 06:39.380
reason for her request.

06:39.380 --> 06:43.920
Mary is very clear that she wants to live.

06:43.920 --> 06:50.240
She does not want to die, but she's suffering terribly, and she's been maxing out her credit

06:50.240 --> 06:51.240
cards.

06:51.240 --> 06:57.040
She has no other options, and she's very clear that as the suffering increases, she will

06:57.040 --> 07:01.780
have to access aid.

07:01.780 --> 07:07.760
My work with Mary suggests to me that there's not a lot of other extra resource we can offer

07:07.760 --> 07:14.480
her that she has not already very carefully and thoughtfully exhausted on her own.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.480
So Mary is one example.

07:16.480 --> 07:20.040
Reagan goes into other examples in the article, of people who have medical problems, but whose

07:20.040 --> 07:23.000
main reason to kill themselves is related to money.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.520
One person is a 38-year-old trans woman who has her college tuition fully funded but wanted

07:27.520 --> 07:32.040
euthanasia because she lives in a one-room studio apartment and there are creepy guys

07:32.040 --> 07:33.680
who also live in the same building.

07:33.680 --> 07:37.240
The K-MAP recordings show us that despite Justin Trudeau's public exclamation that

07:37.240 --> 07:41.400
nobody would be euthanized due to a lack of support, and despite the legal safeguards

07:41.400 --> 07:45.360
that are apparently in place to prevent abuse of the system, nobody actually cares.

07:45.360 --> 07:49.840
It's happening anyway, and nobody in the K-MAP meetings express shock or surprise that

07:49.840 --> 07:50.840
this is going on.

07:50.840 --> 07:53.360
None of them ask if they should stop or re-evaluate what they're doing.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.680
None of them even seem to recognize this is a problem.

07:55.680 --> 08:00.000
Their only response is one, talking about how to teach euthanasia providers to deal

08:00.000 --> 08:03.680
with the moral ramifications of what they're doing, and two, talking about how the rising

08:03.680 --> 08:06.760
death count is going to be useful as a political bludgeon.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.420
And the program's expanding!

08:08.420 --> 08:12.680
Current on-the-table plans are that by March of 2023, euthanasia will be available to people

08:12.680 --> 08:13.680
with mental illness.

08:13.680 --> 08:16.040
In other words, if you're depressed and want to kill yourself, don't worry about

08:16.040 --> 08:17.040
it.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.040
Let the government do it instead.

08:18.040 --> 08:29.960
Now, I can see the point here.

08:29.960 --> 08:33.400
Sometimes kids are born with conditions that they just won't recover from.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.840
But considering how this program is going so far, I don't trust the Canadian government

08:36.840 --> 08:40.400
to make a determination between a newborn who will live for three painful months and

08:40.400 --> 08:44.320
then inevitably die, and a post-partum mom who just wants her kid dead.

08:44.320 --> 08:48.720
In contrast to Stephanie Green's statement that euthanasia in Canada is working fine,

08:48.720 --> 08:52.720
another euthanasia provider, Madeleine Lee, testified to Parliament that the safeguards

08:52.720 --> 08:54.520
to prevent abuse aren't working.

08:54.520 --> 08:58.400
I'm a psychiatrist at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, an associate professor at the

08:58.400 --> 09:03.080
University of Toronto, and a scientist with a research focus on emotional distress and

09:03.080 --> 09:06.480
suicide and cancer, and this includes MADE research.

09:06.480 --> 09:10.880
I led the development of the MADE program for the University Health Network, served

09:10.880 --> 09:16.040
as an expert witness on the Lamb case, and am currently the scientific lead for CAMAP's

09:16.040 --> 09:18.320
MADE curriculum development project.

09:18.320 --> 09:22.480
And what I'd like to tell you today is that I have significant concerns about the pace

09:22.480 --> 09:25.300
and process of the expanding MADE legislation.

09:25.300 --> 09:30.440
I've yet to see a public opinion poll on whether the Canadian populace is in favour of MADE

09:30.440 --> 09:36.140
for all forms of life suffering, and in particular for psychosocial or structural vulnerability.

09:36.140 --> 09:39.440
It's an important question because I believe the Canadian populace, and maybe even the

09:39.440 --> 09:43.280
legislators, are not aware of who has been qualifying for MADE.

09:43.280 --> 09:47.480
I've certainly had cases where I felt compelled to provide MADE against my better clinical

09:47.480 --> 09:50.800
judgement because the law did not adequately protect.

09:50.800 --> 09:56.360
The current legislation leaves too much responsibility in the hands of clinicians, whose application

09:56.360 --> 10:01.340
of the eligibility criteria according to their own values can render the legislated safeguards

10:01.340 --> 10:03.760
impotent.

10:03.760 --> 10:09.000
Also as was said earlier, this is because incurability can include treatment refusal,

10:09.000 --> 10:13.200
an advanced state of decline may not need to be progressive, suffering is determined

10:13.200 --> 10:19.080
only subjectively, and reasonably foreseeable is not legally defined at all.

10:19.080 --> 10:25.040
The absence of a definition of RFND is crucial in light of C7, as patients with prognosis

10:25.040 --> 10:30.640
of several years, or who refuse preventive care, or who voluntarily stop eating and drinking,

10:30.640 --> 10:35.040
can be placed on the supposedly palliative track 1, where there's no longer even the

10:35.040 --> 10:37.980
mandatory safeguard of a 10-day reflection period.

10:37.980 --> 10:42.060
The two-doctor requirement seems to be no safeguard at all, considering there are groups

10:42.060 --> 10:46.940
like Dying with Dignity Canada who keep a record of euthanasia activists who are also

10:46.940 --> 10:49.240
legally empowered to provide the service.

10:49.240 --> 10:53.620
One of the examples given during the KMAP meetings is of a man who clearly didn't

10:53.620 --> 10:58.060
qualify for euthanasia, who was not even of sound mind enough to make the decision, but

10:58.060 --> 11:03.600
who, through Dying with Dignity Canada, was put in touch with Ellen Weeb, a euthanasia

11:03.600 --> 11:06.760
advocate in Vancouver who would do the deed anyway.

11:06.760 --> 11:10.640
She got one of her friends to sign off, he flew to Vancouver, and they ended his life.

11:10.640 --> 11:14.580
Jocelyn Downey, one of the lawyers that worked on the court case to make euthanasia legal

11:14.580 --> 11:19.640
in Canada, has stated during the KMAP recordings that you can just keep asking doctors until

11:19.640 --> 11:21.160
you get the two that you require.

11:21.160 --> 11:25.580
I would also say we need to remember that disagreement doesn't mean you must stop.

11:25.580 --> 11:28.400
Disagreement amongst colleagues.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.860
The law says you must be of the opinion.

11:30.860 --> 11:31.860
That is the standard.

11:31.860 --> 11:36.180
The standard is not everyone has to agree with you, it is you have to be of the opinion.

11:36.180 --> 11:41.040
The standard in the law is that you must exercise reasonable knowledge, care, and skill.

11:41.040 --> 11:47.720
The standard in the law is that you can have a reasonable but mistaken belief about something

11:47.720 --> 11:49.760
and still not be in trouble with the law.

11:49.760 --> 11:55.180
There is no certainty or unanimity required, there is not perfection required.

11:55.180 --> 12:02.160
So people can face disagreement from colleagues and staff, colleagues, sorry, and still proceed.

12:02.160 --> 12:05.940
The end result of this is that there are many paths available to reach the end, and you

12:06.700 --> 12:07.700
only need to find one.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.380
The system makes it easy to die.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.380
And patients know this too.

12:10.380 --> 12:14.160
There is a psychiatrist, John Mayer, who testified to parliament that he's had patients who

12:14.160 --> 12:18.400
could actually get better but who have actively chosen to let themselves deteriorate until

12:18.400 --> 12:22.460
they are eligible for euthanasia because they know just how permissible the medical system

12:22.460 --> 12:25.080
is and how it views people like them.

12:25.080 --> 12:29.440
And none of this matters because the legal system isn't actually prosecuting people

12:29.440 --> 12:32.320
who violate these tissue paper safeguards.

12:32.320 --> 12:35.880
According to one of the rare investigations into a euthanasia case, the police admitted

12:35.880 --> 12:39.060
that this type of investigation is exceptionally rare, rare enough that there's no records

12:39.060 --> 12:40.060
on it.

12:40.060 --> 12:43.260
That might point to the fact that things are actually just fine, that true violations are

12:43.260 --> 12:44.840
happening exceptionally rarely.

12:44.840 --> 12:48.720
However, the director of disability studies at the University of Manitoba, Nancy Hansen,

12:48.720 --> 12:52.640
has stated that due to the way the law is written, there is no legal consequence for

12:52.640 --> 12:54.000
non-compliance.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.400
The people who do the training on how to administer euthanasia, the people who do the assessments

12:57.400 --> 13:01.640
on who qualifies, the people who review the system and look into potential abuses of it,

13:01.640 --> 13:05.360
and the people who provide the public face, they're all the same people, and they're

13:05.360 --> 13:08.920
all multi-decade long pro-euthanasia activists.

13:08.920 --> 13:30.920
Listen to Weeb again.

13:30.920 --> 13:34.600
Does this sound like somebody who is open to criticism of their system, who takes abuses

13:34.600 --> 13:36.040
of the system seriously?

13:36.040 --> 13:37.040
Of course not.

13:37.040 --> 13:40.160
She is one of the architects, and to her, it's working exactly as intended.

13:40.160 --> 13:43.880
The most recent story on this topic is from yesterday, where a booklet aimed towards children

13:43.880 --> 13:44.880
was published.

13:44.880 --> 13:48.480
Don't worry, this isn't to propagandize kids into killing themselves, but it's still pretty

13:48.480 --> 13:49.480
ghoulish.

13:49.480 --> 13:53.840
It's a pamphlet made to be child-friendly to explain what euthanasia is and why it's necessary

13:53.840 --> 13:56.620
for the young relatives of people who have opted to kill themselves.

13:56.620 --> 13:59.400
It's another step on the normalization of this practice, which has been moving ahead

13:59.400 --> 14:03.880
full speed, expanding rapidly and constantly, with no regard for the obvious problems that

14:03.880 --> 14:04.880
it's causing.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.920
Even for someone like me, who thinks that you do ultimately have the right to end your

14:07.920 --> 14:10.120
own life, there's a clear problem here.

14:10.120 --> 14:13.280
It's one thing if you decide to kill yourself on your own as a personal choice.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.760
It's another thing entirely to have a government apparatus built to quickly usher you towards

14:16.760 --> 14:20.420
your death the minute your care becomes too costly for the state to afford.

14:20.420 --> 14:24.600
And in a public healthcare system, where the state is the payer and or provider of healthcare,

14:24.600 --> 14:29.160
there is an extremely serious responsibility on the state to not simply kill people for

14:29.160 --> 14:33.400
bureaucratic efficiency, and in my opinion, that is exactly where Canada is failing right

14:33.400 --> 14:34.400
now.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.040
Thankfully, due to all this high-profile talk, pushback has begun.

14:37.040 --> 14:40.720
The cabinet minister, in charge of Veterans Affairs Canada, flip-flopped a bit, testifying

14:40.720 --> 14:44.040
to parliament that they did indeed inappropriately offer euthanasia, and then later publicly

14:44.040 --> 14:45.400
said on Twitter that they didn't.

14:45.400 --> 14:49.420
However, investigations have shown that it was one rogue individual within the VAC who

14:49.420 --> 14:50.800
did it, and they've been fired.

14:50.800 --> 14:54.880
The plans to expand euthanasia in March of 2023, for those with medical illnesses, is

14:54.880 --> 14:58.080
being challenged in parliament, though only to the point that the opposition is asking

14:58.080 --> 14:59.200
for a delay.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.440
It does feel like the tide is slowly turning, though.

15:01.440 --> 15:05.120
Canadian public opinion on euthanasia has generally been positive, but only when considered

15:05.120 --> 15:06.120
as a last resort.

15:06.120 --> 15:10.120
There's no new polls since all the news came out that I can find, but I can't imagine

15:10.120 --> 15:13.600
people still being okay with it after learning about what's actually been going on.

15:13.600 --> 15:17.160
Of course, there's a few crazies out there who are taking their objections to the extreme,

15:17.160 --> 15:18.160
like this guy.

15:18.160 --> 15:21.480
So I guess in March, Canada will be expanding made to include mental illness.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.500
Now Google vaccine hesitancy as a mental illness.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.680
Are you getting it yet?

15:25.680 --> 15:26.680
Well, alright.

15:26.680 --> 15:30.640
You Google vaccine hesitancy as a mental illness, you get a bunch of anti-vax pages claiming

15:30.640 --> 15:32.840
that it's happening, but no one actually doing that.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.280
Also, you find your own tweet.

15:34.280 --> 15:37.880
Also, you know that made is still ultimately a voluntary program, right?

15:37.880 --> 15:41.440
For all of its problems, and there are many, they all require people to sign up for their

15:41.440 --> 15:42.440
own volition.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.520
And I don't know about you, but I have no intention of ever signing, no matter how

15:44.520 --> 15:45.520
bad it gets.

15:45.520 --> 15:49.920
We can object to what's actually going on, without inventing these doomsday scenarios,

15:49.920 --> 15:50.920
alright?

15:50.920 --> 15:52.840
The reality is bad enough, we don't need this fiction.

15:52.840 --> 15:56.600
And also, I intend to be an obstinate old thorn in everyone's side for as long as

15:56.600 --> 15:57.600
I can.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.280
In fact, if this is the way our society is going to go, I think you have a moral obligation

16:00.280 --> 16:01.280
to.

16:01.280 --> 16:02.280
Look back at that Simon's commercial.

16:02.280 --> 16:05.800
All the propaganda around euthanasia emphasizes how beautiful your death will be.

16:05.800 --> 16:09.520
Even that one clip I used in the last video had the nurse saying something like, suicide

16:09.520 --> 16:10.520
doesn't have to be dramatic.

16:22.840 --> 16:33.720
Now, I'm not advising anyone to do anything, in fact I'm saying explicitly don't kill

16:33.720 --> 16:34.720
yourself, guys.

16:34.720 --> 16:38.000
You know how there's those hyper-masculine twitter accounts that talk about returning

16:38.000 --> 16:41.320
to tradition, and how young boys are being medicated because they can't sit still in

16:41.320 --> 16:45.000
classrooms because their biology has them hardwired to be throwing a spear through the

16:45.000 --> 16:46.880
heart of a leaping antelope or whatever the fuck?

16:46.880 --> 16:50.240
A lot of those are pretty cringe, but there is certainly at least a little drop of truth

16:50.240 --> 16:51.240
in there.

16:51.240 --> 16:55.760
After all, a common male fantasy to die heroically while defending friends or stopping a shooter

16:55.760 --> 16:57.840
or covering your partner or something like that.

16:57.840 --> 17:01.240
That doesn't mean that these men have suicidal ideations, they're not desperately looking

17:01.240 --> 17:02.240
for a way out ASAP.

17:02.240 --> 17:06.280
What it does mean is, if I've got to die, you know, that would be a pretty good way

17:06.280 --> 17:07.280
to go.

17:07.280 --> 17:11.240
I wouldn't be happy that I'm dying, but I would be satisfied if my death meant something.

17:11.240 --> 17:14.000
Compare that ethic to Canada's euthanasia scheme.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.080
My death is an honorable one that helps the people I care about, versus my death is a

17:18.080 --> 17:19.080
beautiful one.

17:19.080 --> 17:22.200
At least that's what state bureaucrats tell me in order to get me to brush myself

17:22.200 --> 17:23.200
aside for their benefit.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.720
I don't know about you, but when I hear that nurse saying that it doesn't have to

17:25.720 --> 17:32.720
be dramatic, I actually think to myself, yeah, it does, it has to mean something if

17:32.720 --> 17:33.720
I'm going to choose it.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.200
I'm not going to peacefully go into the euthanasia pod or whatever.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.640
If I'm going to die, it's not going to be for the benefit of the government.

17:38.640 --> 17:42.640
And right up until the last second I go, I'm going to be a pain in the neck for everyone.

17:42.640 --> 17:45.800
Because fuck every single person who thinks that this shit is acceptable.
