0	10600	Like the last few videos I've done, this video is a direct sequel to a previous one.
10600	16240	This time, my previous video on legal euthanasia in Canada, dubbed MADE, or medical assistance
16240	17240	in dying.
17240	19320	Go back and watch that video before watching this one.
19320	21360	I know I say that a lot, but I really mean it this time.
21360	25200	There's too much evidence in that video to pack into a TLDR.
25200	29320	Last time, I showed you not only the high-profile examples in the Canadian media of people with
29320	34600	injuries or illnesses being inappropriately pushed towards euthanasia, but also circumstantial,
34600	38880	though not conclusive, evidence that the judges who presided over the lawsuits that eventually
38880	42160	made euthanasia legal in Canada may have been heavily biased.
42160	43160	See?
43160	44440	I can't just prove that in a quick TLDR.
44440	46160	You gotta go watch a previous video.
46160	50600	The issue has blown up massively here in Canada since I've last spoken about it, becoming
50600	53680	enough of a shitshow that the rest of the world has begun to take notice.
53680	55920	Most of the time, Canada's pretty unassuming, and you'll like it that way.
55920	59760	I've never seen a Prime Minister have so many obvious failures to draw the attention
59760	63440	of the international community to our little backwater country this much between the trucker
63440	68360	protests and now euthanasia, and it's actually amazing to see just how incompetent he actually
68360	69360	is.
69360	73160	One of the reasons it's blown up is because stories just keep coming out of people being
73160	75200	inappropriately offered euthanasia.
75200	79400	The biggest one recently is of a Canadian Paralympian who lost her legs while serving
79400	80520	in the Canadian army.
80520	83720	She needed a stair lift to travel between the floors of her house, and when she complained
83720	87720	to the government about not getting one, they offered her euthanasia as a replacement
87720	88720	solution.
88720	92840	This sort of thing has led to a bunch of funny memes, where the once internationally held
92840	97300	in high regard Canadian healthcare has been reduced to a joke, a system where doctors
97300	100320	would rather prescribe death than perform the most basic medicine.
100320	101320	And hey, I'm not offended.
101320	105680	I love me some dark humor, but Jesus Christ, this is a situation that we have to fix.
105680	110420	This commercial went viral like a day or two after I published my last euthanasia video.
110420	111440	Good timing on that.
111440	112440	Check this out.
142440	143440	Oh hey, would you look at that.
143440	146860	The first commercial in I don't know how long that only features white people.
146860	149760	No diversity at all, and it's all about killing yourself.
149760	153520	Yeah, the romanticization of euthanasia happening right now is pretty grotesque.
153520	155500	Let me offer you a bit of context though.
155500	158880	At the end when it says Simons, that is a Canadian fashion brand.
158880	161340	It's well known here, but you don't see it outside of Canada really.
161340	165120	You know how, sometimes when the cause that is considered an exceptional social good comes
165120	169000	up like Black Lives Matter or the Ukraine war or mask mandates or something like that,
169000	172920	you'll see American companies run advertisements showing their support for that cause.
172920	174320	They don't actually advertise their products.
174320	178160	They just make a 30 second spot that appears to be emotionally powerful or whatever in
178160	181760	order to spread awareness of the current thing and slap their logo at the end of it so that
181760	184520	you know they believe in what's currently socially acceptable.
184520	188320	That's what this commercial is for Canada, but it's for legal euthanasia.
188320	192120	The most disgusting part of the story though is that after the death of the woman featured
192120	195280	in the commercial, it came out that she actually wanted to live.
195280	199240	The woman featured in a glamorous pro-euthanasia commercial for a Canadian clothing retailer
199240	203440	only opted for assisted suicide after her years-long attempts to secure proper health
203440	204440	care failed.
204440	207780	She was left without primary care after her family doctor moved away.
207780	213020	And so, after her Ehlers-Danlos diagnosis 10 years ago, her treatment had largely consisted
213020	217240	of a chaotic and ineffective stream of specialist appointments, none of whom had any background
217240	218240	in her condition.
218240	221920	I feel like I'm falling through the cracks, so if I'm not able to access health care,
221920	224220	am I then able to access death care?
224220	225860	And that's what led me to look into MADE.
225860	228520	It is far easier to let go than keep fighting.
228520	231860	The British Columbian health care system had been unable to provide her with the care she
231860	235020	needed, but they rapidly approved her application for euthanasia.
235020	236060	And she's not the only one.
236060	239460	The majority of examples I provided last time were of people who didn't actually want
239460	243020	to die, but for whom the government was refusing to care for adequately.
243020	248260	A recent example is of Les Landry, who directly says that poverty is why he's choosing to
248260	249260	die.
249260	252460	The two-doctor approval system I described in the previous video, where there's strict
252460	257060	rules on what a doctor can approve euthanasia for, seems to have entirely broken down.
257060	261980	As Landry provided to the media an email where he directly states that being poor is why
261980	262980	he's doing this.
262980	265220	And the reply is, yep, all good, let's go.
265220	269420	Just a few days ago, a journalist, Alexander Rakin, blew the cover off of why this whole
269420	273480	thing is happening, in his article for The New Atlantic, No Other Options.
273480	276800	He makes the same observation that I did, the stunning number of stories coming out
276800	280340	over the past few months showing abuse of the Canadian euthanasia program.
280340	284060	He brought it up with one of Canada's most prolific euthanasia providers, Stephanie Green,
284060	287980	who claims, alongside other supporters, that the worries are being purposefully blown up
287980	291940	by a sensationalist press, that the stories aren't being accurately reported on, and
291940	295380	that the safeguards preventing abuse of the system are in place and working.
295380	300420	Rakin claims that the CAMAP, the Canadian Association of Made Assessors and Providers,
300420	305120	which is not a government entity, but rather a pro-euthanasia activist group run by Stephanie
305120	310020	Green herself, has sat on evidence showing that people who choose euthanasia do so because
310020	313980	they're poor or they have debt or they're getting evicted, and that illness is simply
313980	315700	a pretense for a lot of people.
315700	319900	CAMAP holds online seminars for euthanasia providers to help instruct medical staff in
319900	320900	the process.
320900	324900	One topic that came up was what should be done about poor people who come to them.
324900	331940	When the Supreme Court decision came down in 2015 or 2016, and it evidently omitted
331940	335740	the need that somebody be at the end of life.
335740	345420	My first thought as an OT back then was, this could be an extraordinary lever to improve
345420	350940	social supports in this country if we can gather the stories of people who would opt
350940	355300	to die because the social supports are so poor.
355300	361620	I have long hoped to get a funding grant together to try to do that.
361620	376060	In case you didn't catch that, Kevin Reel, a senior medical ethicist at Sunnybrook Hospital
376060	380160	in Toronto and the former president of the Canadian Bioethics Society, is speaking about
380160	384300	euthanasia as if it's a given that they'll be killing poor people because they're poor,
384300	388620	and is hoping to use their deaths in a political manner to massively expand the social welfare
388620	389880	state in Canada.
389880	393560	During the same meeting, they go over the various cases of people who have been euthanized,
393560	397840	and one of the examples is of a 55-year-old woman who identified poverty as the primary
397840	399380	reason for her request.
399380	403920	Mary is very clear that she wants to live.
403920	410240	She does not want to die, but she's suffering terribly, and she's been maxing out her credit
410240	411240	cards.
411240	417040	She has no other options, and she's very clear that as the suffering increases, she will
417040	421780	have to access aid.
421780	427760	My work with Mary suggests to me that there's not a lot of other extra resource we can offer
427760	434480	her that she has not already very carefully and thoughtfully exhausted on her own.
434480	436480	So Mary is one example.
436480	440040	Reagan goes into other examples in the article, of people who have medical problems, but whose
440040	443000	main reason to kill themselves is related to money.
443000	447520	One person is a 38-year-old trans woman who has her college tuition fully funded but wanted
447520	452040	euthanasia because she lives in a one-room studio apartment and there are creepy guys
452040	453680	who also live in the same building.
453680	457240	The K-MAP recordings show us that despite Justin Trudeau's public exclamation that
457240	461400	nobody would be euthanized due to a lack of support, and despite the legal safeguards
461400	465360	that are apparently in place to prevent abuse of the system, nobody actually cares.
465360	469840	It's happening anyway, and nobody in the K-MAP meetings express shock or surprise that
469840	470840	this is going on.
470840	473360	None of them ask if they should stop or re-evaluate what they're doing.
473360	475680	None of them even seem to recognize this is a problem.
475680	480000	Their only response is one, talking about how to teach euthanasia providers to deal
480000	483680	with the moral ramifications of what they're doing, and two, talking about how the rising
483680	486760	death count is going to be useful as a political bludgeon.
486760	488420	And the program's expanding!
488420	492680	Current on-the-table plans are that by March of 2023, euthanasia will be available to people
492680	493680	with mental illness.
493680	496040	In other words, if you're depressed and want to kill yourself, don't worry about
496040	497040	it.
497040	498040	Let the government do it instead.
498040	509960	Now, I can see the point here.
509960	513400	Sometimes kids are born with conditions that they just won't recover from.
513400	516840	But considering how this program is going so far, I don't trust the Canadian government
516840	520400	to make a determination between a newborn who will live for three painful months and
520400	524320	then inevitably die, and a post-partum mom who just wants her kid dead.
524320	528720	In contrast to Stephanie Green's statement that euthanasia in Canada is working fine,
528720	532720	another euthanasia provider, Madeleine Lee, testified to Parliament that the safeguards
532720	534520	to prevent abuse aren't working.
534520	538400	I'm a psychiatrist at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, an associate professor at the
538400	543080	University of Toronto, and a scientist with a research focus on emotional distress and
543080	546480	suicide and cancer, and this includes MADE research.
546480	550880	I led the development of the MADE program for the University Health Network, served
550880	556040	as an expert witness on the Lamb case, and am currently the scientific lead for CAMAP's
556040	558320	MADE curriculum development project.
558320	562480	And what I'd like to tell you today is that I have significant concerns about the pace
562480	565300	and process of the expanding MADE legislation.
565300	570440	I've yet to see a public opinion poll on whether the Canadian populace is in favour of MADE
570440	576140	for all forms of life suffering, and in particular for psychosocial or structural vulnerability.
576140	579440	It's an important question because I believe the Canadian populace, and maybe even the
579440	583280	legislators, are not aware of who has been qualifying for MADE.
583280	587480	I've certainly had cases where I felt compelled to provide MADE against my better clinical
587480	590800	judgement because the law did not adequately protect.
590800	596360	The current legislation leaves too much responsibility in the hands of clinicians, whose application
596360	601340	of the eligibility criteria according to their own values can render the legislated safeguards
601340	603760	impotent.
603760	609000	Also as was said earlier, this is because incurability can include treatment refusal,
609000	613200	an advanced state of decline may not need to be progressive, suffering is determined
613200	619080	only subjectively, and reasonably foreseeable is not legally defined at all.
619080	625040	The absence of a definition of RFND is crucial in light of C7, as patients with prognosis
625040	630640	of several years, or who refuse preventive care, or who voluntarily stop eating and drinking,
630640	635040	can be placed on the supposedly palliative track 1, where there's no longer even the
635040	637980	mandatory safeguard of a 10-day reflection period.
637980	642060	The two-doctor requirement seems to be no safeguard at all, considering there are groups
642060	646940	like Dying with Dignity Canada who keep a record of euthanasia activists who are also
646940	649240	legally empowered to provide the service.
649240	653620	One of the examples given during the KMAP meetings is of a man who clearly didn't
653620	658060	qualify for euthanasia, who was not even of sound mind enough to make the decision, but
658060	663600	who, through Dying with Dignity Canada, was put in touch with Ellen Weeb, a euthanasia
663600	666760	advocate in Vancouver who would do the deed anyway.
666760	670640	She got one of her friends to sign off, he flew to Vancouver, and they ended his life.
670640	674580	Jocelyn Downey, one of the lawyers that worked on the court case to make euthanasia legal
674580	679640	in Canada, has stated during the KMAP recordings that you can just keep asking doctors until
679640	681160	you get the two that you require.
681160	685580	I would also say we need to remember that disagreement doesn't mean you must stop.
685580	688400	Disagreement amongst colleagues.
688400	690860	The law says you must be of the opinion.
690860	691860	That is the standard.
691860	696180	The standard is not everyone has to agree with you, it is you have to be of the opinion.
696180	701040	The standard in the law is that you must exercise reasonable knowledge, care, and skill.
701040	707720	The standard in the law is that you can have a reasonable but mistaken belief about something
707720	709760	and still not be in trouble with the law.
709760	715180	There is no certainty or unanimity required, there is not perfection required.
715180	722160	So people can face disagreement from colleagues and staff, colleagues, sorry, and still proceed.
722160	725940	The end result of this is that there are many paths available to reach the end, and you
726700	727700	only need to find one.
727700	729380	The system makes it easy to die.
729380	730380	And patients know this too.
730380	734160	There is a psychiatrist, John Mayer, who testified to parliament that he's had patients who
734160	738400	could actually get better but who have actively chosen to let themselves deteriorate until
738400	742460	they are eligible for euthanasia because they know just how permissible the medical system
742460	745080	is and how it views people like them.
745080	749440	And none of this matters because the legal system isn't actually prosecuting people
749440	752320	who violate these tissue paper safeguards.
752320	755880	According to one of the rare investigations into a euthanasia case, the police admitted
755880	759060	that this type of investigation is exceptionally rare, rare enough that there's no records
759060	760060	on it.
760060	763260	That might point to the fact that things are actually just fine, that true violations are
763260	764840	happening exceptionally rarely.
764840	768720	However, the director of disability studies at the University of Manitoba, Nancy Hansen,
768720	772640	has stated that due to the way the law is written, there is no legal consequence for
772640	774000	non-compliance.
774000	777400	The people who do the training on how to administer euthanasia, the people who do the assessments
777400	781640	on who qualifies, the people who review the system and look into potential abuses of it,
781640	785360	and the people who provide the public face, they're all the same people, and they're
785360	788920	all multi-decade long pro-euthanasia activists.
788920	810920	Listen to Weeb again.
810920	814600	Does this sound like somebody who is open to criticism of their system, who takes abuses
814600	816040	of the system seriously?
816040	817040	Of course not.
817040	820160	She is one of the architects, and to her, it's working exactly as intended.
820160	823880	The most recent story on this topic is from yesterday, where a booklet aimed towards children
823880	824880	was published.
824880	828480	Don't worry, this isn't to propagandize kids into killing themselves, but it's still pretty
828480	829480	ghoulish.
829480	833840	It's a pamphlet made to be child-friendly to explain what euthanasia is and why it's necessary
833840	836620	for the young relatives of people who have opted to kill themselves.
836620	839400	It's another step on the normalization of this practice, which has been moving ahead
839400	843880	full speed, expanding rapidly and constantly, with no regard for the obvious problems that
843880	844880	it's causing.
844880	847920	Even for someone like me, who thinks that you do ultimately have the right to end your
847920	850120	own life, there's a clear problem here.
850120	853280	It's one thing if you decide to kill yourself on your own as a personal choice.
853280	856760	It's another thing entirely to have a government apparatus built to quickly usher you towards
856760	860420	your death the minute your care becomes too costly for the state to afford.
860420	864600	And in a public healthcare system, where the state is the payer and or provider of healthcare,
864600	869160	there is an extremely serious responsibility on the state to not simply kill people for
869160	873400	bureaucratic efficiency, and in my opinion, that is exactly where Canada is failing right
873400	874400	now.
874400	877040	Thankfully, due to all this high-profile talk, pushback has begun.
877040	880720	The cabinet minister, in charge of Veterans Affairs Canada, flip-flopped a bit, testifying
880720	884040	to parliament that they did indeed inappropriately offer euthanasia, and then later publicly
884040	885400	said on Twitter that they didn't.
885400	889420	However, investigations have shown that it was one rogue individual within the VAC who
889420	890800	did it, and they've been fired.
890800	894880	The plans to expand euthanasia in March of 2023, for those with medical illnesses, is
894880	898080	being challenged in parliament, though only to the point that the opposition is asking
898080	899200	for a delay.
899200	901440	It does feel like the tide is slowly turning, though.
901440	905120	Canadian public opinion on euthanasia has generally been positive, but only when considered
905120	906120	as a last resort.
906120	910120	There's no new polls since all the news came out that I can find, but I can't imagine
910120	913600	people still being okay with it after learning about what's actually been going on.
913600	917160	Of course, there's a few crazies out there who are taking their objections to the extreme,
917160	918160	like this guy.
918160	921480	So I guess in March, Canada will be expanding made to include mental illness.
921480	924500	Now Google vaccine hesitancy as a mental illness.
924500	925680	Are you getting it yet?
925680	926680	Well, alright.
926680	930640	You Google vaccine hesitancy as a mental illness, you get a bunch of anti-vax pages claiming
930640	932840	that it's happening, but no one actually doing that.
932840	934280	Also, you find your own tweet.
934280	937880	Also, you know that made is still ultimately a voluntary program, right?
937880	941440	For all of its problems, and there are many, they all require people to sign up for their
941440	942440	own volition.
942440	944520	And I don't know about you, but I have no intention of ever signing, no matter how
944520	945520	bad it gets.
945520	949920	We can object to what's actually going on, without inventing these doomsday scenarios,
949920	950920	alright?
950920	952840	The reality is bad enough, we don't need this fiction.
952840	956600	And also, I intend to be an obstinate old thorn in everyone's side for as long as
956600	957600	I can.
957600	960280	In fact, if this is the way our society is going to go, I think you have a moral obligation
960280	961280	to.
961280	962280	Look back at that Simon's commercial.
962280	965800	All the propaganda around euthanasia emphasizes how beautiful your death will be.
965800	969520	Even that one clip I used in the last video had the nurse saying something like, suicide
969520	970520	doesn't have to be dramatic.
982840	993720	Now, I'm not advising anyone to do anything, in fact I'm saying explicitly don't kill
993720	994720	yourself, guys.
994720	998000	You know how there's those hyper-masculine twitter accounts that talk about returning
998000	1001320	to tradition, and how young boys are being medicated because they can't sit still in
1001320	1005000	classrooms because their biology has them hardwired to be throwing a spear through the
1005000	1006880	heart of a leaping antelope or whatever the fuck?
1006880	1010240	A lot of those are pretty cringe, but there is certainly at least a little drop of truth
1010240	1011240	in there.
1011240	1015760	After all, a common male fantasy to die heroically while defending friends or stopping a shooter
1015760	1017840	or covering your partner or something like that.
1017840	1021240	That doesn't mean that these men have suicidal ideations, they're not desperately looking
1021240	1022240	for a way out ASAP.
1022240	1026280	What it does mean is, if I've got to die, you know, that would be a pretty good way
1026280	1027280	to go.
1027280	1031240	I wouldn't be happy that I'm dying, but I would be satisfied if my death meant something.
1031240	1034000	Compare that ethic to Canada's euthanasia scheme.
1034000	1038080	My death is an honorable one that helps the people I care about, versus my death is a
1038080	1039080	beautiful one.
1039080	1042200	At least that's what state bureaucrats tell me in order to get me to brush myself
1042200	1043200	aside for their benefit.
1043200	1045720	I don't know about you, but when I hear that nurse saying that it doesn't have to
1045720	1052720	be dramatic, I actually think to myself, yeah, it does, it has to mean something if
1052720	1053720	I'm going to choose it.
1053720	1056200	I'm not going to peacefully go into the euthanasia pod or whatever.
1056200	1058640	If I'm going to die, it's not going to be for the benefit of the government.
1058640	1062640	And right up until the last second I go, I'm going to be a pain in the neck for everyone.
1062640	1065800	Because fuck every single person who thinks that this shit is acceptable.
