0	3960	Hey guys, Dev here, and I've got something special for you today.
3960	8980	What this is, is an hour and 40 minutes of an internal Antifa meeting.
8980	14000	Apparently someone from the Politically Incorrect board over at 8chan managed to sneak in and
14000	15260	record this.
15260	18820	And just to make sure that it doesn't get wiped off the face of the internet, I'm uploading
18820	23500	it to my channel along with relevant timestamps to interesting bits.
23500	28940	In my opinion, the best bit is around an hour and 10 minutes in, where they basically admit
28940	31320	that they're out there to incite violence.
31320	36680	This might be what we need to get a legal conviction or something along those lines
36680	40120	against the people behind groups like Antifa and BAM.
40120	41940	Alright guys, happy listening.
41940	42440	I love you.
58940	86940	I remember cutting these off so well.
86940	114940	Happy listening.
114940	142940	Happy listening.
142940	170940	Hey, how are you guys doing?
170940	195940	Nice to meet you.
195940	197940	How did you guys hear about this?
197940	199940	There was a sign outside of work.
199940	200940	Oh, shit.
200940	201940	Where was, uh...
201940	202940	Nordea.
202940	204940	Oh, a little bit Nordea.
204940	208940	Yeah, it was scary stuff.
208940	209940	You saw that.
209940	211940	I had no idea, to be honest.
211940	213940	I came to Peterborough like a year ago.
213940	215940	I was in Kitchener, Waterloo before that.
215940	217940	Scary stuff.
217940	221940	Yeah.
222940	227940	This is... Kevin's been around for a long time.
227940	229940	Uh, at least a few years.
229940	233940	I guess he started noticing him maybe like three years ago.
233940	238940	I think he started to do events maybe just in the last year?
238940	239940	Yeah.
239940	242940	As far as I can tell.
243940	246940	I've seen like other people.
246940	253940	There's like maybe a couple of neo-Nazi looking types that I've seen like maybe once or twice.
253940	255940	They like come and go, you know?
255940	257940	Yeah.
257940	258940	Yeah.
258940	259940	I've seen similar downtown.
259940	263940	You walk in the street, they'll talk about that.
263940	265940	Yeah, I guess the trouble is you don't really know.
265940	268940	Unless you see up close and like some of their representatives
268940	273940	start to like know for sure what they're concerned with.
273940	274940	Yeah.
274940	276940	Yeah, because I mean you do get like kind of able to go like
276940	277940	rush people or something around.
277940	279940	You don't want to yell at somebody and be like,
279940	280940	oh shit, they're a comrade.
280940	282940	They're actually anti-racist too.
282940	283940	Yeah.
283940	284940	Yeah.
284940	285940	Yeah.
285940	291940	How about you folks, like was this a big thing where you were previously kind of thing?
291940	294940	I don't really know that much about it, to be honest with you.
294940	298940	I just saw it and I saw the ad out there.
298940	302940	I looked up the page and I thought, yeah, I should probably learn some more about that.
302940	303940	Sure.
303940	304940	I'm saying the same for yourself.
304940	305940	Yeah.
305940	306940	Yeah.
306940	307940	You've been in Peterborough for a while?
307940	308940	Yeah.
308940	309940	Yeah.
309940	310940	Yeah.
310940	311940	Is this pretty new to Peterborough?
311940	312940	No, no.
312940	313940	I've been to Buckhorn and stuff.
313940	314940	Oh.
314940	315940	And I'm from the area, right?
315940	316940	Yeah.
316940	318940	So I was in Peterborough for work, so.
318940	319940	Oh, okay.
319940	320940	We're roommates.
320940	322940	Anywhere we go, we're going to have both of you.
322940	323940	Yeah.
323940	332940	Yeah, we're going to have to figure out what needs to happen here.
332940	337940	I'm hoping, as I know Mikey, who was at the meeting, one of those said he was coming tonight
337940	339940	to talk to a fellow named Seth.
339940	341940	He said he'd be coming tonight.
341940	344940	We'll see if there's more people coming.
344940	345940	Oh, awesome.
345940	346940	Excellent.
346940	347940	Hello?
347940	348940	Mikey?
348940	349940	Yeah?
350940	351940	Mikey?
351940	352940	Yeah?
352940	355940	Maybe he's going to have a second baby here.
355940	356940	Yeah.
373940	378940	Yeah, like a positive ideation or whatever.
378940	379940	Yeah?
379940	380940	Yeah.
383940	385940	Build it and they will come.
385940	386940	Yeah.
386940	387940	Yeah.
394940	397940	There is a bit of water there.
397940	398940	I like it.
398940	399940	I like it.
402940	404940	Sort of a condition of like a cardiac?
404940	405940	Yeah.
406940	412940	It's sales, right?
412940	416940	So it can be pretty frustrating because of that.
416940	421940	It's not here nor there.
421940	423940	It's not awful.
423940	424940	Yeah.
424940	430940	It has to be because you're doing a lot of negativity.
430940	431940	Yeah.
432940	433940	Yeah.
440940	443940	Yeah, that tends to happen with a lot of people.
443940	444940	Yeah.
444940	445940	Yeah.
445940	447940	There's always so much yelling that you can take.
447940	450940	Things won't fuck off and go shoot yourself.
450940	451940	Yeah.
451940	452940	Yeah.
452940	453940	Yeah.
453940	454940	You need development.
454940	456940	I'm just kidding.
456940	457940	Yeah.
457940	458940	Yeah.
458940	459940	I've been looking around.
459940	462940	I've been looking around the last couple of weeks to be honest with you.
462940	463940	Yeah.
463940	465940	It's been your last five or eight?
465940	466940	Yeah.
468940	471940	How long have you been out here?
474940	476940	Almost a year.
476940	478940	Almost a year.
478940	482940	Probably 18 months.
482940	483940	Yeah.
483940	485940	That's two years.
485940	486940	Yeah.
486940	488940	A bit pretty hydrated over there.
488940	489940	Oh, yeah.
489940	490940	There's a lot.
490940	491940	There's a room.
491940	492940	Yeah.
492940	493940	Yeah.
493940	497940	You have a lot of summer kids and stuff like that, but there's a lot of turnover.
497940	502940	I mean, there's, from when I did my training class, there were only three people left.
502940	505940	It was like, that training class was like 30.
505940	506940	Yeah.
506940	507940	Yeah.
507940	508940	Yeah.
508940	509940	Yeah.
509940	510940	Yeah.
510940	511940	In case people live here, it would be like that.
511940	512940	Not in shock.
512940	513940	Yeah.
513940	514940	Yeah.
514940	516940	I'm actually the only one left in my training class out of 10.
516940	517940	Yeah.
517940	518940	Pretty much here.
518940	519940	Yeah.
519940	520940	So.
520940	521940	Gotta do it.
522940	523940	Awesome.
524940	526940	Can I just throw a little repeating on them?
527940	528940	Okay.
528940	530940	I might watch the last minute.
538940	539940	In here?
539940	540940	Let's go.
543940	544940	Spits up one second.
544940	545940	Okay.
545940	552940	Okay, if you want to grab a glass of water, there's some water there for me and then you can go once.
552940	555940	That's washing back that way, right?
555940	556940	Sort of?
556940	558940	Yeah, sort of.
564940	571940	Alright, well, we need to get back at seven now, so we might as well get started and, you know, see what comes of it.
571940	574940	People trickle in, trickle in.
586940	589940	Well, we'll wait for Mike to get back.
589940	590940	Yeah, that's right.
590940	592940	We'll go to the washroom and then start talking.
592940	595940	It's not very calm right at the office.
602940	604940	Alright.
612940	614940	I know. Like, was that?
617940	619940	Yeah, I didn't know.
619940	623940	I kind of felt like they had that under control.
623940	626940	It looks a little weird.
626940	627940	I know they wanted to do it.
627940	628940	Yeah.
629940	632940	I don't know. Did anyone else do another one?
632940	634940	I think you did.
642940	647940	Yeah, there's definitely two different strategies in terms of approach.
647940	648940	Okay.
650940	654940	So, it's not the happiness Monday evening?
654940	657940	Well, not quite as much, maybe.
658940	676940	They're talking about, I think that we talked them into not coming up, but they were talking about not doing anything Saturday and having a Sunday day of celebration of the revolution and something to show the Nazis they were wrong.
676940	678940	Awesome. That's kind of quite a word.
679940	681940	Alright.
681940	694940	So, I guess, yeah, on that point, Kevin Goudreau announced his rally, I think, on the 7th or 8th.
694940	700940	In the 11 days since then, there's been a bunch of different kinds of organizing happening.
701940	708940	Maybe just in terms of what we know about Kevin, just go around the table and kind of get that on the table.
708940	713940	I know he's the leader of the Canadian Nationalist Front.
713940	724940	Near as I can tell, the Canadian Nationalist Front doesn't consist of a huge amount of people other than Kevin Goudreau and some friends, it would seem.
724940	729940	But he does have support of some, but not all, of the white nationalists across the country.
729940	747940	He's alienated from Storm Alliance, which is a fairly large new group that broke away from the soldiers' vote, which in turn, they started from a Finnish group that is hardcore neo-Nazi fascist types.
747940	749940	Killed someone last year.
749940	750940	Yeah, killed someone last year.
751940	756940	So, Storm Alliance is disavowing Kevin Goudreau publicly.
756940	759940	Colin O'Leary, who is their main spokesman, said that.
759940	766940	That seems to be more along the lines that Storm Alliance is just a lot better at imaging than Kevin Goudreau is.
766940	775940	They're very good at putting the message forward that we're not against, we're not racist, we're just in favor of a white Canada.
776940	789940	So, they've done a lot better job of trying to do these kinds of actions, like they do things like work in soup kitchens or do free needle pickups to try and cover their image.
789940	803940	But when you look at what they're doing, they're also doing street patrols, which is what happened in Finland, where they're going along and then if they find someone they don't like because they're homeless, whatever, they beat them up.
803940	811940	And that started to happen in some places across the country, particularly in Quebec, where they're a lot stronger. The movement there in general is a lot stronger.
813940	819940	Is there anyone else in terms of what you know about Kevin? People have stuff they want to bring forward?
819940	829940	I just want to add, I don't know if it is public to everybody yet, but is there a location for the square?
829940	853940	It might be an aspirational move on Kevin's part, where he's kind of doing a power plan saying, look, we have this massive venue, now everyone's going to show up, but I don't actually know if that means we can expect 100, 200 people.
853940	875940	Trying to seem more official. What I saw, he said, I've got permit in hand, so it seems he's really trying to legitimize himself in a way that he wasn't before, but it would be nice to not let him have that platform to spew his shit.
876940	880940	Anything else you want to bring forward?
883940	901940	It's interesting, I think that a lot of these folks, how we approach these things is that it's very, you're talking about soup kitchens, so you don't pick up. It's kind of like how these folks start doing things, and we're kind of seeing that in Peterborough, in the Boudreau, kind of marketing this as an anti-immigration, anti-Trudeau rally.
901940	908940	It wasn't a good tattoo on his chest, so it's a really fun thing to look at.
915940	922940	You've probably had more experience with Kevin than anyone else. What's your read on him?
923940	938940	Well, I get the impression he's volatile, because he may be more likely when he's drunk, because he attacked a friend at the spill. He was working there, he kicked him out.
939940	963940	I've had a direct conversation with him. This is another night, he had the same product, he was there, and I had a direct conversation with him. I was asking him to renounce his beliefs and this kind of thing.
964940	977940	It was kind of a long conversation, he kept trying to divert the conversation from that, trying to relate to me with things that we might have in common, like punk music or white music.
977940	993940	I kept bringing it back to the subject, and then eventually I gave him the question again, and he said that he wouldn't, and if he posed the same question to me, how would I respond to that?
993940	1006940	I was like, okay well, you're going to have to go, if you don't, I'm going to have to see your beliefs.
1006940	1028940	So that means, he was like, can't I just finish my beer? I'm like, no, I'm okay. So in that instance, he didn't fight back, but I also invoked the crowd that was there, because people would be outside with me.
1029940	1040940	Yeah man, I think that's cut a little bit. For sure. Yeah, so we were just talking about Kevin, what do we know about him? Kevin Monroe is the one that called the rally, I'm sure everyone's aware at this point.
1041940	1049940	And just kind of going over what we know about him, so we were just saying, can we volatile, but also not necessarily volatile.
1050940	1066940	He's been in Peterborough for three-ish years maybe, but only really actively organizing in the last year, and his group is the Canadian Nationalist Front, and then we were also saying that there's a time and place now for the meeting, or for his rally.
1066940	1092940	Yeah, so starting at two is what I've heard, and going until 4.30, so that kind of brings us to the next question I guess, which is, what are we going to do about it?
1093940	1105940	There's a lot of different kind of talk that's happened. I guess the other question, going around the table, how many people have been involved in at least one other meeting up until this point about this?
1106940	1114940	So just kind of getting people caught up, because I know a couple of us have been at a bunch of these meetings, but other people are just building into this. So Mikey, you've been at a bunch of the meetings.
1115940	1116940	Do you want to go around please?
1117940	1119940	Maybe it's your experience with activism.
1120940	1129940	So people just want to go around, name, pronouns, and any other stuff involved from this organizing.
1130940	1131940	Thank you, sir.
1132940	1150940	I'm Mikey. I go by he pronouns. I was trying to organize about the first page that I know of about the rally. Unfortunately, the difference of that approach and everything, but I happened to a few of the events.
1150940	1162940	I was there for the meeting before last, like the big one was trying to unite all of these groups, where there was a lot of talk of people wanting to do an event on Saturday.
1163940	1173940	But in that specific group, there was a lot of energy towards not addressing them or acknowledging them in order to not give them the show time.
1174940	1183940	And also a lot of talk about doing something on Sunday to celebrate the community diversity, but there's a lot of energy going on for those things.
1183940	1196940	There's also people that go to the chocolate night or something on Friday. I was thinking maybe we could talk about if they insist on continuing to do that, we could talk about a security kind of force for them.
1197940	1203940	Maybe team up with a couple of them because they would be targeted by Kevin in this group for sure.
1203940	1220940	Hello, my name is Kevin. I go by he pronouns. I have been doing anti-fascist work for a couple of years. I've been doing security work for a little bit of time now, I guess.
1220940	1230940	I haven't gone to many of the meetings for the last little while, but I do that going forward. I've been very busy with school, so that would be good.
1231940	1235940	Anything else? Yeah, let's go see if we'll have one.
1236940	1254940	Hi, I'm Stu. He pronouns. I've gone to a couple of meetings that have been called since the rally called by Kevin to meetings about trying to combat that rally.
1254940	1273940	I've been involved with a bit of this kind of stuff in the distant history for me. I guess in the early 90s or mid-90s in Sarnia.
1273940	1291940	There are some things that I know from that time, but it's in a different time now in terms of digital, the way that social media has changed everything.
1291940	1304940	Also, the fact that street thug is always discredited, so Nazis are trying to look different and conceal what they're doing.
1304940	1325940	I've been to one meeting. I saw a couple of the people there. Like we were saying, it seems like there's been a lot of energy, excitement.
1326940	1343940	But at the same time, I think people are underestimating and also perhaps I think because of the political opinions, underestimating just how dangerous and persistent fascists and Nazis can be.
1343940	1356940	There's a lot of this like, well, if we just love them enough, they're going to stop being Nazis. There are people out there, if we get to them early enough and if we convince them politically because they don't hold a lot of strong political beliefs.
1356940	1367940	If we hit people on the ground first thing and say, hey Nazis are going to say black people, indigenous people, women, trans people are your enemy. That's bullshit. Your boss is your enemy.
1367940	1384940	If you hit that first thing, maybe there's something you can convince, but you get to people like Kevin and they already kind of know what they think and it can be dangerous to just kind of let them say whatever they want for the sake of allowing free speech.
1385940	1409940	I've been to two meetings for this already and I have something to do with the fact that there's been a lot of, it's concerning that a lot of people don't want to do anything on the actual day of this event and people are really afraid of actually applying to the 94 platform and I think that's the biggest thing that we should be focusing on is the fact that it's, you're not going to stop these people from having these opinions.
1409940	1414940	The most important thing you do is stop them from spreading out as if there's more people.
1415940	1437940	My name is Steve. I've been to one meeting as well. I agree with everyone else that has spoken, but methods suggested by other groups will likely prove ineffective and potentially probable in the long run and it's important to do more direct actions.
1438940	1450940	I'm RJ. He, him pronouns. I didn't know this much was going on. I saw the sign out there and I just want to know if I can do more about that, to be honest.
1451940	1465940	My name is Christopher. I'm calling in from Washington. I'm calling in for dinner, basically. I don't care. I'm just getting some information. I'm trying to figure out what's going on.
1465940	1474940	Sure. Then I'm going to be doing a video about some of the things that you can do.
1475940	1495940	I know that I should learn. When I was younger, I started to realize that I was really into the racist hand names. I've gotten a lot of them for the past few years, just because I didn't know what was going on.
1495940	1506940	But, yeah, I just started hearing about all of this going on. I'm on social media very much, but I didn't see any of the signs and I feel like, you know what, it's getting to me.
1509940	1522940	I'm Crystal. I'll take just about any pronouns that are typically a share. I haven't actually gone to any meetings or anything, but I tend to be fairly active when I'm online.
1522940	1531940	Sharing these kind of meetings and social anxiety mostly has got me into it so far, but it's kind of time to stand up for a show.
1531940	1554940	Fair enough. Right now it looks like there is going to be something else going on on the day of possibly, but not in terms of actively confronting Kevin and trying to keep him from spreading his message.
1555940	1572940	Our kind of hope was that this could be a good way to start, but the other thing that we were kind of hoping to do or I was hoping to do by initiating past is the problem that this stuff will keep happening.
1572940	1587940	And although we could shut it down each time it does happen, the fact that we can only get 10 people out to a meeting kind of thing is a sign that the movement as a whole isn't particularly strong right now.
1588940	1596940	And if we're going to have the capacity to keep doing this kind of work, we're going to need to grow it.
1597940	1611940	So I guess in terms of what that kind of means, my thought of how to go forward would be that it's really important to go and try and get as big of a group of people as we can and shut Kevin down.
1612940	1621940	But it's also important to educate all the people walking by what exactly is going on and make sure that our political message that's getting out there.
1622940	1642940	So with that in mind, for the 30th, I guess my suggestion would be we should call some sort of public rally to try and get as many people as possible to show up.
1642940	1661940	Because we don't know exactly how many people are going to bring, probably won't be more than 20, but that still means we're going to need more than 10 people to actively shut them down and stop them from getting a victory, a propaganda victory kind of thing.
1661940	1667940	And of those people, my suggestion would be some would be involved in directly hunting this.
1668940	1680940	I don't know whether we want to directly confront him or whether we feel that's in our capacity because that has a whole separate set of risks and concerns and if people are going to do that, they need to know what they're doing.
1680940	1693940	But we can certainly make sure that he doesn't go unopposed and make sure that he isn't able to just kind of parade over wherever he wants and call it this great big victory for himself and look how much everyone here rallies behind me.
1694940	1706940	And then to that end, I think part of it would also be good is if we could get some form of propagandizing the people who are going by and make sure that every person that goes by that rally gets our message.
1706940	1717940	And here it's like, hey, here's who showed up, here's what his politics are, here's what our politics are, here's what his ideas aren't acceptable, if you agree, here's something you know you could do.
1718940	1719940	What are your politics?
1720940	1727940	Yeah, so that's the next step. It's the question of what are the politics in the room. So, the path.
1728940	1748940	There hasn't been a path meeting yet, so we can draft a mandate and put those politics forward. I would suggest that the politics should be anti-fascist, anti-racist, anti-transphobia, and then also anti-capitalist.
1748940	1762940	Because if we look at it, it seems to me that a lot of the violence and the nastiness that comes from these fascists stems from basically people being frustrated with the system.
1763940	1772940	And so part of stopping fires that we have to put out is also thinking about the system and how that creates it. But we should go around the table for that.
1773940	1774940	Carole, do you want to start?
1775940	1776940	Sure.
1776940	1779940	I'm just trying to not always keep saying that.
1780940	1790940	I mean, in general, I would say the whole anti-hate of all kinds, like specifying this kind of hate, that kind of hate, that kind of hate, it just separates groups.
1791940	1798940	So, stating that we are anti-all hate, like any kind of hate against any kind of group, would be my first thought.
1799940	1807940	Because fascists don't differentiate who they're going to hate. They don't care if you're black or gay or trans or disabled. It doesn't matter.
1808940	1815940	I mean, they don't care what you are. I mean, you can be white, but you have Jewish heritage or a Jewish-sounding name and you're not as a Jewish.
1815940	1816940	We should have more of those.
1817940	1818940	Exactly.
1821940	1823940	But anti-hate belongs to us.
1826940	1838940	And then yeah, just like we're saying, basically stating that we're not the ones causing the problems that the people that they're rallying against are not the people causing the problems that they're united against.
1839940	1842940	But what about the problems they have? They're not caused by these people.
1843940	1848940	People who are opposed to immigration who say, oh, well, immigration people take our jobs.
1849940	1851940	So your problem isn't immigrants. Your problem is jobs.
1854940	1862940	If you think that all Mexicans are rapists and all black people are drug dealers, then your problem isn't people of different color. Your problem is crime.
1868940	1870940	Anyone else want to go for it?
1881940	1890940	Yeah, just for inclusion and for a more equal distribution of resources and resources.
1890940	1912940	I would be more inclined to agree with Ken, I think, as far as his community. I like the idea of anti-hate, but I think it's pretty justifiable to hate Nazis.
1912940	1920940	I don't think being against hate of all people is necessarily, I don't know if I'm wording that right, but.
1921940	1922940	What does it look like?
1923940	1924940	I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.
1924940	1925940	I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.
1926940	1927940	I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.
1928940	1929940	I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.
1930940	1931940	I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.
1932940	1933940	I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.
1934940	1935940	I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.
1936940	1937940	I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.
1938940	1939940	I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.
1940940	1941940	I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.
1942940	1943940	I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.
1944940	1945940	I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.
1946940	1947940	I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.
1947940	1958940	I think the biggest problem with trying to, like, organize people around the point of view of the media is that it's such an endless concept that it's hard to actually have a concrete understanding of what that means as far as mandates of organizing.
1959940	1967940	And that's why we thought it would actually go in and do peace analysis and say, like, we're actually against these specific things and these parts of society.
1967940	1974940	And it's nice to just be like, well, we're against the people that are being asked to do this to you.
1975940	1980940	But that's not good enough because it doesn't let us continue to organize anything beyond them.
1981940	1991940	If your structuring organization is in good response to these other political ideologies, there's no actual unity within what you're doing as an organization.
1991940	1997940	You're just simply being against the group that you perceive as being happy, wrong opinions.
1998940	2001940	And so there's no actual unity within an organization that does that.
2002940	2010940	But we started listening. It's often new to start saying, well, we're not just saying, you know, against, you know, racism and against, you know, transphobia.
2011940	2014940	Then we also have to say homophobia and religious intolerance and xenophobia.
2015940	2019940	And then we started listening often and asking, you know, we can say we're against all these things.
2019940	2031940	But the overall, like, it's kind of like a pride, right? Pride isn't about, like, just gay, just bi, just, you know, you don't just have a lesbian brain, just bi brain, just, you know, it's everybody.
2032940	2037940	It's a rainbow. It's everybody of all colors, of all religions. It's the whole idea of pride for everyone, pride in yourself.
2038940	2043940	You know, it's not even excluding straight people. It's like, hey, come be out. It's everybody. Be proud to be part of the group together.
2044940	2051940	So you can, you can be listed off individual things while also stating our overall day, like, literally an anti-hate rally.
2052940	2058940	Because there's, one thing that most people get behind is, I don't want to be a hater. Nobody wants to be a ridiculous.
2059940	2064940	You can have different kinds of negative views, but somebody can be racist and be like, oh, but I'm not sexist.
2065940	2067940	You know, somebody can be sexist, but whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm a homophobic.
2067940	2073940	And, like, if you're not saying you're against all things, then you're basically saying, well, then some kind of things are okay.
2074940	2083940	You know, those people are not our problem. And that's been a problem in a lot of the civil rights kind of fights over the years.
2084940	2089940	Like, you know, the feminist movement was coming along. They were saying, oh, black women are the bad guys. We don't want to make it about black people.
2090940	2095940	And when there was, like, black rights movement was there a limit of that, but we want to make it about color, not just about gender.
2096940	2103940	You know, with the gay rights thing, you know, a lot of times trans people are being put to death because, whoa, whoa, gay rights starts when you can bring back everyone else.
2104940	2108940	Right. So once you start putting one thing forward, you're putting another people behind you.
2108940	2128940	So I guess, like, I agree with the strategy of trying to, like, point people or, like, give people counter narratives or, like, things that would undermine the foundation of, like, for example, like,
2128940	2136940	of, like, for example, the cabinet's politics taking root and the people that are, like, passing by or whatever.
2137940	2150940	I also think that it's important to be, like, that it doesn't have to be, like, explicit or that it could be subtle as opposed to, like,
2150940	2161940	like, having to tell people they should hate their boss instead of hating, like, people of color or immigrants or whatever.
2162940	2172940	Because, like, people, I don't think people are, like, incapable of forming their own, their own conclusion.
2172940	2179940	It's just that they have, like, they don't have enough information. They also have other people telling them what to believe as well.
2180940	2200940	And so, like, I think if we're talking about, like, producing information to distribute on this thing, then, yeah, I guess I think that the most effective information would be stuff that engages with the political ideas that he's putting forward for this rally.
2200940	2210940	And it's, like, seemingly simple as they might seem to us, but basically decimating them in a way that's, like, clear language.
2211940	2226940	And I guess something that's, yeah, that messes up the foundation or, like, the ground that he can plant those seeds of his own ideology in,
2226940	2250940	which is also, I think it's, like, would require, like, a systemic analysis as well, but I don't think, like, it's a fine line between, like, giving people too much, like, I guess we do have an ideology or whatever, which, like, if we, yeah, once we get into, like, ideological stuff,
2250940	2268940	we're probably going to find that, like, not everyone in the room are on the same page, and for the sake of, like, being able to proceed to organize this, like, counter event, it's, we may not want to get, like, bogged down in that kind of thing.
2269940	2284940	I think, like, I don't disagree with not hating everybody, and I also agree with the idea of, like, showing people where they're, like, giving people an alternate narrative or politics,
2285940	2305940	but I also think, like, pending, like, more time to develop a shared mandate or whatever, like, it's possible, like, it might not be possible for us to have, like, a shared mandate in a certain way, but I guess the best way to do that would be, like,
2305940	2326940	one that's, like, a really low common denominator between all of us, and that, I'm not sure if that's what we want to do for, like, long term moving forward, but at least for the sake of this, like, event, like, trying to, yeah, come up with a shared strategy,
2326940	2339940	and you are, like, jobs to do at it, and then, um, yeah, and then trying to, like, destroy the politics of, of Kevin's route, and that's improved.
2339940	2353940	So, like, yeah, like, okay, so in terms of what you're saying, so, like, I hear what you said, like, you know, we had something about propaganda as a thing of doing, which I guess, so it's like, like, each individual person can have a couple of talking points, right?
2353940	2372940	Like, like a basic argument of integration, and they say integration is bad because whatever, independence is bad because whatever, however, there are three basic points, you know, to capture that, and, you know, like, for each argument, there are a number of things they're saying in the rally, and we could have just, like, a couple of fucking points, and this is why that's not accurate, this is why that's not accurate.
2373940	2391940	Yeah, exactly, so it's, like, you don't have to make the whole rally a whole thing, you know, to put it all on the fender, but you can have individual people basically saying, like, you know, what are your concerns, you know, integration, okay, let's talk about integration, like, you know, what are your concerns, okay, racism, here's, here's what they're saying about it, and here's what's actually true.
2392940	2399940	So it doesn't have to be, like, a big essay, it doesn't have to be a big thing, but we could make just, like, a couple of bullet points for each major argument.
2403940	2416940	Yeah, sure, so yeah, I actually, I think there's a lot of value being said on both sides of the table here, I think that there's some genuine concerns about a lack of intersectionality, a lack of folks being able to show popular solidarity between the press groups.
2417940	2434940	I think that's something that we definitely need to put on the table, right, because we gotta, when we're thinking about, you know, how do we combat fascism, how do we also make sure that if the groups that are, you know, going to be attacked first are the ones who are given the political power within the movement, right?
2435940	2456940	And so I think that the answer to the question that we talked about, oh, should we say hate, or should we say, or should we, you know, take apart what precisely we're talking about, I think there's value in actually doing that, in a particular part, because we can say to people, you know, someone who's an immigrant, and say, like, yeah, like xenophobia is what's affecting you, and on an individual level, we can be like, alright, let's, what can we do about that, right?
2457940	2474940	Where if we say, just hate, sometimes it, like with the crime by far, I want to say, kind of gets lost in sort of the ether, where it's like, oh, we're against hate, but to someone who's an immigrant, they might not be able to interpret that as something that is xenophobia specifically, or something that is specifically sexism or racism or transphobia.
2474940	2482940	So I think there's some value in sort of going out there, and then targeting specific groups to be like, hey, what can we do for you, and what can we not do in both?
2482940	2484940	I think that is something, kind of what you're talking about.
2488940	2504940	Absolutely, yeah. I think that's the approach we take, is if we want to organize the most, the people who are the fascists are going to come for it, we should go there to those people, and the people have to deal with it, because they, you know, they feel like shit every day, so they know what's happening.
2504940	2533940	Okay. I think Ken has a lot to say about being upfront about the politics, and mine is that I'm either in common with left, and or just whatever you want to describe it as, and in that moment, that he definitely came across a lot of an issue that I think that we'll run into, if we're trying to touch populist progressions in the chip room, where the things like racism, to some extent sexism, things like this, there's been a lot of progress.
2533940	2554940	There's been a lot of progress on the populist section, but the people who are most vulnerable to movements like Ken's, like transphobia and ableism, those are issues that still run to the core of a lot of common people who identify as progressive, but haven't been forced to address that.
2554940	2572940	So I believe, like as you were saying, that we should just say, and I hate, but then on individual talking, you have to really address and empower those groups, because they are the ones that Ken will attack, and so forth.
2572940	2600940	But, again, definitely managed to be representative, and more of that discussion about how people who will be walking by and focused on things like, hey, like what you guys are doing, those are the people who might act accidentally, or might just act still intrinsically to themselves if they haven't questioned yet, notions of transphobia, ableism, and so on.
2601940	2615940	Yeah, and honestly, I think that should be one of the talking points, but I know a lot of people who don't think that racism is here, because they don't experience racism in the world.
2615940	2618940	People who say, oh, I'm so progressive.
2646940	2653940	It's taken some of my friends being with me in a room and seeing something happen before they were like, wow, does that happen all the time?
2654940	2660940	It's just a little thing, but it's just one of those little things that happens all the time, and things get worse.
2661940	2666940	When I first moved to Peterborough, I literally had people help me go back to Africa, go back to Jamaica.
2667940	2671940	Now I have people helping me go back to India, go back to Pakistan, go back to Iran.
2672940	2675940	They don't even know what I am. They're just like, you're some kind of brown, whatever, get it?
2676940	2678940	I'm like, I've lived in Peterborough for 20 years.
2679940	2681940	I've got people who moved here last year being like, you don't belong here.
2681940	2683940	I'm like, how can you go in here?
2688940	2694940	Again, she's seen a lot of it herself, and she's had to literally wait until I left the room to then talk to other people.
2695940	2698940	These people are just acquaintances. I mean, don't freak you guys.
2699940	2703940	This is not just a one-to-one situation. This is a serious thing. Stop.
2704940	2709940	You know, I've had to explain a lot to these people because they didn't understand that I was racist at this.
2710940	2711940	Yes, and let me explain why.
2712940	2715940	Let me explain that I don't think you were racist, but I understand that you have views that you just didn't know any better.
2716940	2717940	Let me explain better.
2718940	2720940	I understand that, wow, I didn't mean to, but it's been a while, you know.
2721940	2727940	But it's still dependent, and I've noticed that the bottom of the connection is that we don't need to get out and rally,
2728940	2729940	because whatever, the rally was only two people, it wasn't even a big deal.
2730940	2733940	Just because there was, you know, a rally, it wasn't even a fever.
2734940	2736940	It was racist fever, it was fun, it was not fever at 12 o'clock.
2737940	2739940	Yeah, but you don't, basically. You're not willing to stand up against it.
2740940	2742940	How much do you think the rest of the city is?
2743940	2746940	Like, if you don't think it's that big a deal, then it's definitely not a big deal.
2747940	2749940	But the fact is, it's definitely a big deal.
2752940	2756940	So, you know, if you're not standing up against it, you're basically telling them that, you know,
2756940	2758940	that you're not standing up against them.
2759940	2762940	What they're saying is, you might not be doing the rally with them, but you think, you know,
2763940	2764940	these guys know what you're talking about.
2765940	2768940	And every time there's a rally in a Jewish city, anywhere else in the world,
2769940	2770940	the same response is going to happen.
2771940	2774940	Anytime they get told, you know, oh, whatever, the police are going to protect them,
2775940	2777940	they have to write a free speech, hate speech, whatever, it doesn't matter.
2778940	2782940	Every time, two days later, it shows up on your website, so, you know, frankly, websites.
2783940	2785940	See, this place, you know, supports us, yadda yadda yadda.
2786940	2790940	Even last year, where Kevin actually literally got shared with them,
2791940	2799940	there was still them talking about, yeah, talking about like, oh, you know, I had a really good response,
2800940	2806940	and how well received he was, kind of like.
2807940	2809940	So that's, yeah.
2810940	2812940	Yeah, I mean, that's a scary thing.
2812940	2815940	I mean, I've been in Peterborough for like just over a year now,
2816940	2817940	and I haven't even heard of that guy, to be honest.
2818940	2821940	Up until, like, I saw that poster, I saw it work.
2822940	2826940	Has somebody been, I haven't seen any posters yet.
2827940	2829940	Is he living around town a lot?
2830940	2835940	No, I saw the ad for tonight, but I've never even heard Kevin before.
2836940	2839940	I saw that ad, to be honest with you, and I've been in Peterborough for over a year.
2840940	2841940	Where did you see the ad?
2842940	2844940	On the outside, or where did it go?
2845940	2846940	No, it was at this meeting, sorry.
2847940	2850940	Yeah, he hasn't put up any posters.
2851940	2853940	I've seen any of these.
2854940	2855940	Sorry?
2856940	2857940	Yeah, yeah.
2862940	2869940	So, like Stu was saying, he now probably just gets something figured out for the 30th kind of thing.
2869940	2877940	So, in terms of what can they agree on, the things that everyone's seen, or what I'm hearing everyone's on the page with,
2878940	2887940	is that we need to create some kind of propaganda to, I've heard the term inoculate news, basically give a counter message,
2888940	2897940	and then the other portion of it has to be we need to stop him from getting any press kind of thing.
2897940	2899940	We need to make it so that if you look in on the street, you're not going to say,
2900940	2904940	oh, there's a bunch of neo-Nazis rallying, you're going to say, huh, not really sure what's going on in there,
2905940	2908940	but I'm not seeing any neo-Nazis probably marching back and forth.
2909940	2913940	So, that seems to me to be the two kind of things that need to happen.
2917940	2923940	The other thing we should plan for is it has happened in the past in other cities where they'll call the rally,
2923940	2932940	and then they don't show up because they're worried about too much of a counter-demonstration showing up.
2933940	2938940	I mean, that's a great victory for us if it does happen, but we should also have a plan for if that does happen,
2939940	2943940	so we don't all get there and go, oh, okay, well, what are we going to do now kind of thing.
2944940	2946940	Like the same thing.
2947940	2948940	Still tell people.
2948940	2956940	You might have been hearing these things on the news or on the internet. Don't listen.
2957940	2966940	So, what do we want to do in terms of the actual logistics of that day?
2967940	2969940	What time are we going to show up?
2970940	2972940	Yeah, time and place and all that stuff.
2973940	2977940	I mean, ideally, we'd want to probably meet up before this group gets there.
2978940	2982940	So, we'd be happy to have around 1.30, 1.45-ish.
2983940	2990940	I think it would be a unique place to meet at the, just around the corner of City Hall and the block.
2991940	2993940	It's called the Federation Park.
2994940	2998940	I'm thinking maybe we want to meet at the other park, both behind the government buildings.
2999940	3002940	That one, maybe we'll meet there. I think it's right there.
3005940	3006940	Okay, try that part.
3008940	3018940	Now, just so you guys know, in terms of community relations, we're also organizing a cultural protest with the community organizations.
3019940	3023940	So, just so you know, he definitely has a block for the Federation Park.
3024940	3027940	And he's booked it from 11, 4.30.
3028940	3029940	That's important to the city.
3030940	3035940	So, whether or not he's going to be there that fast the whole time, depends on the date of the time.
3036940	3043940	I saw a post on, like, right with the website that said 2.05.
3044940	3047940	They booked it only from, like, when I just came through that.
3048940	3058940	So, if he's at 4.30, if he doesn't have to be there from 11, he can go to 4.30.
3059940	3067940	He could have had that time, too, as, like, a buffer where he can call and say, somebody's on this region, or this area that I have booked, go escort them all.
3068940	3069940	And then come to another one.
3070940	3076940	It might be good if you have somebody there from 11 till 4, and we just hang out in the park, and then it'd be like a single man kind of thing.
3077940	3078940	I'd be scared of that.
3079940	3080940	Yeah, yeah, essentially.
3082940	3083940	I think that's maybe the only way we can...
3084940	3086940	That was an area, so it's actually funny.
3086940	3103940	Does anybody have a background in graphic design or anything like that, though, for making the posters, banners, etc., that we want to put around town, as well as the templates that we might be able to include?
3104940	3105940	I can take that off.
3105940	3108940	With the content of the pamphlet, I imagine that folks have some things to say.
3109940	3116940	So, maybe if folks wanted to message what they wanted to say to the computer or the page, I can plug it into the pamphlets.
3117940	3120940	It might actually be a better idea if we wanted to get together for another meeting.
3121940	3125940	Just the people, maybe, that want to work on the pamphlet, specifically.
3126940	3129940	That way we're at the same room, it's a little bit easier to coordinate and edit.
3130940	3131940	That'd be good though.
3136940	3138940	So, you definitely will see the posters made online.
3141940	3146940	So, just so you know, we've been working on press meetings for the last two or three days.
3147940	3158940	And our press meeting is going to be done by tomorrow, on Friday, to have people sign.
3158940	3161940	So, I'm sure that we'll get a copy of it.
3162940	3167940	And we're definitely also doing a banner.
3168940	3174940	That would have messaging, anyone's friends who love this here.
3175940	3184940	And we'll also make sure we know that this door is open.
3184940	3196940	So, what are you guys talking about?
3197940	3203940	Just like what you're saying, we're going to have someone there watching you.
3203940	3204940	There we go.
3205940	3208940	Because if you don't know, you may not show up, like he said.
3209940	3211940	And, or, you may not show up.
3212940	3217940	So, we're going to have someone there for you, you know, before you vanish the whole time, then before 30.
3218940	3221940	And, we're going to be across the street.
3222940	3226940	We booked that thing through our United Church.
3227940	3229940	So, we're going to be, we're going to have three people there.
3229940	3233940	If there are banners, we're going to have like, we're going to be as loud as possible.
3234940	3237940	We're going to have music, we're going to just have the whole program speeches.
3238940	3246940	And then we will have a banner that will go through on the sidewalk.
3247940	3252940	A large, very, it's simple to say, love this here, end white supremacy.
3253940	3255940	And it's going to be very large.
3256940	3259940	So, per the day of the, so on the 30th?
3260940	3263940	Yes, yeah, the day of, and also to the next day.
3264940	3268940	We booked Confederation Park.
3269940	3276940	And the reason I know that he booked it from 11.30 to 4.30, because I went to the city to find out what time.
3277940	3280940	And they said, they said we didn't have anything.
3281940	3287940	So, then I went back the same day, and because he said, okay, we'll book this space so that they can get it.
3288940	3290940	I went back the same day to a different person.
3291940	3293940	And she said, oh, they booked it from last week.
3294940	3296940	And I said, oh, well, they just booked me this morning, it wasn't booked.
3297940	3303940	And she said, oh, I don't know why she didn't tell you that, because it's clearly written right here that they have that space.
3304940	3307940	Does it just say specifically who booked it?
3308940	3312940	And it has some anti-immigration, anti-crucial approach.
3313940	3314940	That's what she asked.
3315940	3316940	That's what we titled it.
3317940	3318940	But that's not true.
3319940	3324940	And also, I think we know that this is not the only line.
3325940	3326940	That there's a few.
3327940	3331940	Yeah, so Storm Alliance called it originally, and there's a letter going on across the country.
3332940	3333940	Yeah.
3333940	3340940	So, Storm Alliance is a lot better organized than Kevin, and a lot more dangerous, just because they're organized.
3341940	3342940	But yes, yeah.
3343940	3346940	There was originally one happening in Toronto on Hamilton, both of those were canceled.
3347940	3349940	But Niagara, Peterborough, and Ottawa are still going on.
3350940	3352940	And I'm worried that folks are having a little trouble reading the book.
3353940	3354940	Yeah.
3357940	3358940	Okay.
3359940	3360940	Go ahead.
3360940	3377940	So, from your own personal networks, do you have an impression that there's more than just what's here tonight that is interested to go and be present, counteract the racist rally?
3378940	3389940	I'm confident that, like both organization and personally, there's probably another 15, 20 people that I know that should be out there.
3390940	3395940	I'm also expecting at least 5 to 10 more members.
3396940	3399940	I said I'm here for them more.
3400940	3401940	Yeah.
3402940	3403940	How about yourself?
3404940	3405940	I'm not sure.
3406940	3407940	I'm not hearing back from people.
3408940	3412940	So, I'm not hearing people talking about it, but I don't hear.
3413940	3414940	People talking about it.
3415940	3416940	Yeah, yeah.
3417940	3419940	People are looking at time for themselves.
3420940	3426940	Maybe now that there's a definite time, maybe we'll need something we don't care about.
3426940	3427940	Yeah.
3428940	3436940	Yeah, I guess that impacts what kind of strategy you normally use.
3437940	3438940	Yeah.
3439940	3457940	It's definitely like, you don't want to lose the confrontation with them because it's bad for your health, but also for propaganda purposes, it's not good to get.
3458940	3459940	An organization would do it.
3460940	3462940	Yeah, it's not good to get by the Nazis.
3462940	3469940	The Nazis are the police that in turn are going to ask to be on the area and they won't have a place to play.
3470940	3471940	Yeah.
3473940	3481940	So, with that in mind, is it possible that there's a necessity to just let people know that this is happening ahead of time?
3481940	3491940	In which case, should we be handling down counts like, hey, there's a rally happening at this time, one week from now, five days from now.
3492940	3497940	If you don't agree with this, you should be out there to help drown them out and shut them down.
3498940	3499940	In other words.
3500940	3503940	Yeah, well, yeah, also let people know what's happening.
3504940	3515940	So, just as far as timeline is concerned, so it's going to be on Friday we're going to have this, the press release is quite intense, but whatever.
3516940	3522940	We're going to be sending it out to different organizations, have signatures, we'll send it out to your group, as many people as possible.
3522940	3537940	So, Monday it gets top like PR, so we're asking that one year we're going to be saying yes, we're going to have a rally, our rally.
3538940	3540940	So, that's our timeline.
3541940	3545940	And then on Wednesday we're going to have a press conference.
3546940	3549940	And we'll let as many people come up to that as well.
3550940	3557940	Because the press has been asking us and we've been amongst the word until we're straight in our minds all the more.
3558940	3563940	So, Friday is a press release, Monday is a release too.
3563940	3568940	Wednesday is a press conference next week.
3569940	3575940	And Saturday is going to be a auction and somebody is going to let down their hair braid.
3583940	3592940	Well, we should decide as an organization whether we want to follow the same timeline or not.
3593940	3604940	I think there's a certain juxtaposition in terms of both strategy and kind of a larger view on how fascism needs to be combated going on.
3605940	3614940	And for that reason I think, I'm not sure, although we're working on the same cause, we're completely locked in step on everything.
3615940	3621940	But it's the group's decision and I'm just a single member of the group.
3623940	3631940	I would suggest the most effective way to get the biggest number of people out, to drown Kevin out, is as soon as possible.
3632940	3636940	Let people know about it, start pamphletting, start letting people know.
3637940	3652940	We need to figure out where the best spots to hand out the pamphlets are and definitely get them out, definitely get them out.
3653940	3663940	And then the only thing I can really think of on the day of handing out pamphlets, we do have to watch out to be individual at it.
3664940	3667940	Because then, these guys are really violent, right?
3668940	3671940	You go out there individually, right?
3672940	3674940	Do you want to make sure?
3675940	3679940	What kind of numbers are expected for Saturday?
3679940	3691940	Well, we have different groups. We have Quick, we have Peace Council of Europe, we have the Peace Name Centre, we have Food Not Long.
3692940	3696940	We have faith groups there as well.
3697940	3701940	We're hoping that we get down to people.
3701940	3707940	We already have Teddy, we have these bookings, but it's private as well.
3708940	3714940	And private, even we invited only two hundred and a half of them said yes, they're going to come. That's only at two hundred.
3715940	3721940	The last one I did, last month, we had three hundred and that was just two degrees.
3722940	3729940	So, we're hoping to get a good response for sure. Yeah, definitely.
3729940	3733940	And that's for the Saturday one as well as the Sunday one?
3734940	3736940	We're aiming more for the Saturday.
3737940	3746940	Because we want to know that, for example, people coming, like our immigrant people, especially people of colour,
3747940	3757940	if they're there protesting, you know, down with black people and no one's doing anything, then people are not going to feel safe.
3757940	3764940	So, we want to say that, you know, these are the minority and hopefully with all this happening, maybe they will show up.
3765940	3771940	But I suspect that they're going to. That's my gut feeling.
3774940	3780940	Are there indicators that people from other parts of Ontario will come here or Ottawa?
3781940	3785940	Ottawa has something going on. Niagara has something going on.
3785940	3787940	Windsor has something going on.
3788940	3791940	London, I think there might be something going on.
3792940	3796940	But Toronto, there's nothing going on. Hamilton has nothing going on. They're the two really big centres.
3797940	3801940	And there's like, there's the JNO in Toronto. There's soldiers going to Toronto. There's Storm Alliance.
3802940	3806940	There's a bunch of our groups, so there is a possibility that those folks will show up.
3807940	3810940	Plus, just Kevin's own connections from Boy Power.
3811940	3813940	Yeah, and from my perspective.
3813940	3828940	So, basically, even if you don't follow the exact timeline and, well, hand-putting or just, you know, putting up posters, even if it just was saying, hey, like, come out and protest against fascism on this day.
3829940	3835940	Like, it doesn't necessarily have to be the timeline. We don't have to say the guy's name or what the protest is or where he is. We don't want to advertise for him.
3836940	3843940	But telling people, like, if you were going to take Peterborough, if you, you know, you don't want this kind of thing in Peterborough, then come out on this day, you know, around this time.
3844940	3848940	Like, it doesn't necessarily have to be for, say, like, for this rally, for that one, just to show up.
3849940	3851940	And your venue is across the road.
3852940	3870940	So we could even, even if we choose to do a different timeline, perhaps say to them that is the venue of the counter-protest, just for the sake of legitimacy kind of thing and also not promoting where his rally is going to be.
3871940	3877940	So that thing that this is where the counter-protest is, this is where they will want to be to do the direct action.
3878940	3886940	The only concern I would have is it sounds like there's two very different strategies. Like, if one strategy is to confront him more, the other strategy is not to.
3887940	3899940	You don't want people confused on which one they're shown up to. If someone thinks they're shown up to a peace rally against a way kind of thing, that's very different than if someone's shown up to a rally that is, you know, going to...
3900940	3902940	A peace rally versus a counter-protest.
3902940	3907940	They're different things, and you don't want people showing up for one, think they're showing up for the other, like that's just...
3908940	3915940	But even raising awareness in the first place, like a random person on the street probably doesn't know there's going to be a rally.
3916940	3930940	Oh yeah, I'm not suggesting that. I just think it might be, it could actually confuse and muddle things. If you say, hey, show up here, and then people are like, well, I showed up for this, or people show up and, okay, these people are going, oh, I'm going to follow them, oh, no, that's not where I want to be, I want to be over here, kind of thing.
3930940	3932940	So are we going to...
3933940	3947940	So we could give the information that multiple groups are planning to, you know, account for this with, you know, an anti-hate rally, or, you know, a peace rally here, or a counter-protest there, to say that there are various groups coming together.
3948940	3952940	You know, you don't want to say this one group without one group, but this group's doing this, this group's doing that.
3953940	3958940	But at least it gets people looking up information on their own, and they can find that online, or check out each individual group.
3959940	3968940	So where are we going to put on our posters? Are we saying that our venue is Confederate Square, and saying, come to bear where we'll be counter-protesting, or are we going to stay in that venue?
3969940	3975940	I would say across the street, so you're not, you're not people showing up and, like, showing up on the precious doorstep.
3976940	3983940	Like, you know, you don't want people showing up and being at risk until you've got enough numbers that everyone is safe that shows up.
3984940	3988940	Henry, we, I assume, aren't going to get a permit for that or anything?
3989940	3990940	We're not going to get a permit for this animal.
3991940	3993940	So, across the street is going to be better.
3994940	4010940	Just on your point, yeah, we definitely are not, haven't named that person, so we are not giving, like you said, any PPR, and definitely, if you say confirmation from on your posters, the city, because we, when we were planning our rally,
4011940	4012940	Be very careful.
4013940	4018940	The city calls me because you don't have a permit, and so we had to get a permit.
4019940	4027940	We had, like, four rallies, and that was the first time the city, because you said the legal team called and said, do you know they're going to have this rally?
4028940	4029940	So we had to get a permit.
4030940	4034940	So if you put configuration permit, you're going to have a city call you and say, where's your permit?
4035940	4037940	But you could definitely be on the sidewalk.
4038940	4040940	That's, you don't need a permit for those things.
4040940	4043940	It's very hard to promote organizing just outside of that.
4044940	4045940	We don't want the president to be able to.
4046940	4047940	On the sidewalk, yeah.
4048940	4049940	I wouldn't be worried about it at all.
4050940	4051940	I think we'll, I think we'll, yeah, there'll be no problem.
4052940	4053940	All right.
4054940	4055940	So this is a.
4056940	4057940	This is a.
4058940	4059940	There's a rally.
4060940	4061940	This is a decision here that has to be made.
4062940	4064940	We should actually make a dead democratic decision on that topic.
4065940	4079940	So I guess the question is, where do we want to gather for a more confrontational rally, or do we want to do that?
4080940	4081940	And I guess just going around the table.
4082940	4091940	First, do we want to hold something that is more confrontational, that is separate for various reasons from more of a peace vigil approach to this?
4092940	4093940	I would vote in favor.
4094940	4095940	Stu?
4096940	4097940	For me, it's like somewhat conditional.
4098940	4100940	I guess like it's situational.
4101940	4102940	So.
4104940	4107940	Because it's definitely about like numbers and stuff like that.
4108940	4118940	So I'm kind of like, yeah, I defer to, I don't know if I have enough information at this point.
4119940	4122940	I support it theoretically.
4123940	4131940	If we have lots of numbers that we're interested in doing that, then I support that.
4132940	4133940	Appreciate it.
4133940	4138940	Well, to address that point, I guess, how do we deal with that question?
4139940	4144940	It seems to be we're going to need to just plant the flag, or we're not for sure not going to have the numbers kind of thing.
4145940	4146940	Right.
4147940	4154940	Should it be the case that we call it, and if we have the numbers, we go and confront.
4155940	4157940	If we don't have the numbers, we don't.
4158940	4159940	Right.
4160940	4168940	Yeah, I guess I would kind of maybe wait and see what other people feel about it, I guess, as well.
4170940	4172940	Yeah, so I would be in favor of that.
4173940	4178940	I guess maybe just to give some reason, because it does happen quite as well, just to talk about stuff.
4180940	4188940	When we think about, you know, having a peace rally, having a computational rally, I think that by the nature of sort of peace rallies,
4189940	4195940	I think that there's like a duality of tactics we can use, where like, yeah, people can be given computational, people can take the vaccine, do different things, right?
4196940	4197940	We can walk and chew gum.
4198940	4206940	At the same time, though, I almost see what's happening here is almost by having these two separate rallies, we're actually sort of doing a huge, tremendous disservice,
4207940	4213940	and tremendous service to the fascists by not confronting them.
4213940	4222940	Not only are we giving them space to be politically active, we are giving them space to propagandize, we're giving them space to consolidate, and we're giving them space to organize.
4223940	4228940	So, just to give a little bit, a really quick little historical bit here, in 1930s Germany, Nazis are on the rise.
4229940	4235940	There are several organizations, like the Waitrose Federation, as well as groups like the Roger Frankfurt Fund.
4236940	4242940	One organization chose the peaceful route. When the Nazis began to consolidate power, they were executed and thrown in jail.
4243940	4253940	The militant folks who combated the Nazis, they did that, and they were also, because of the disservice of a lot of the peaceful folks who were there, they were also killed and executed.
4254940	4262940	When we think about fascism, and how it rises, and when we look at it as an historical example, as we should, because history is a thing we should study and learn from,
4263940	4271940	we see that every single time that fascism is rode, whether it be in Italy, Spain, Germany, anywhere you go, where fascism is giving state power.
4271940	4277940	It has been because there have been large groups of people who have purposefully separated themselves from being congregational.
4278940	4285940	And, as much as I don't want to be the bearer of values, peace isn't going to do much. It's really not.
4286940	4292940	These folks are arming up. They are in bed with the palace angels. They have plans to kill and murder people.
4293940	4299940	They are not just simply having this rally to hang out with each other. They're having this rally to recruit, so they can get more people armed up and ready to kill people.
4299940	4306940	It is up to us, as organizers, and people who genuinely care about the union fascism, to be militant and to be combated.
4307940	4315940	And if we don't do either of those two things, fascism will rise, because that's what it's done in every single country, where people decided that peace would be a better opportunity than combativeness.
4316940	4324940	And what I'm seeing here is sort of very tragic, because I'm seeing a very, like, a repeat of history, where it's like, folks, we've made these mistakes so many times.
4324940	4330940	Let's not make it again. Let's get together. Let's shut them down. Don't give them the space to organize. Let's organize on the day.
4331940	4343940	Let's say Kevin Goodrich. Let's say they're Nazis. Let's say this is what they're doing. Let's tell people what they're doing, because they're telling people what they're doing, and we should be able to reveal the reality of the situation to people.
4343940	4359940	And so I would say that I think I'm very strongly in favor of a constitutional rally, because I would feel absolutely terrible if I was a part of the White Rose organization in Germany that advocated peace, or if I was a part of some organization in Spain, it would be that promoted peace and gave rise to fascism.
4360940	4362940	So, pretty strongly in favor.
4362940	4391940	As well, with my political ideology background and everything, I'm very skeptical of the police network, especially in Peterborough, of all places, and I expect that we are going to be seen and kind of structured in the response to everything as an unable force, regardless of if we do a peaceful thing or anything else.
4392940	4399940	In terms of confrontation, I think if they have high numbers, there is a risk of confrontation from them, especially with both venues, extremely close.
4400940	4420940	With that in mind, and with the skepticism about the police stepping in to be protecting the force, I am in favor of us having a separate thing where, when we say direct action, it isn't intrinsically a punch in the face, but it will possibly consider non-legal action,
4420940	4423940	like rallying with the permit and everything.
4424940	4436940	If we have the numbers marched through the streets, as we did at DACA last year, which got the masses' attention, versus if it was just a meeting in Confederate Square, then it would be activists learning about what is happening.
4436940	4446940	I think we need to be very upfront about it. I think that organizing is a violent act in itself, because they are organizing to commit violence.
4447940	4466940	In that sense, I think that we should, I agree that we need to have a separate group, or at least perhaps if it is open, an informal faction of the other group, where we will be separating off to the street.
4467940	4475940	Yeah, for sure. Also, when we are at Confederate Square and they are here, we need to be the buffer for short, 100%.
4476940	4486940	So, we are definitely here to stop the spread of this white supremacy in different ways.
4487940	4499940	Definitely, you have to be fresh in the sense that they have to know that what they are doing is totally not something that we want here in the city.
4500940	4522940	The problem with, if there is a larger group, the problem is that if we don't stop saying that we don't want them here, then people from other places can see Peterborough as things that you can just come in and be white supremacists and then leave there.
4523940	4541940	So, we definitely don't want that. But what we do want to see is something like what happened in Vancouver, where there were so many people who came together and protested the streets that it kind of drowned out the white supremacists to say that they are not welcome there.
4541940	4559940	Now, having said that, my concern is that if you are, like you said, you are going to be hunting in the face of being violent and or shouting really dehumanizing statements, you are just being like them.
4560940	4567940	And when you become, when you need to dehumanize somebody, it's easy to go places that you don't want to be.
4568940	4572940	If you are, you know, using outright, you know, a lot of techniques.
4573940	4580940	And that sometimes, or at times, if it's very militant, it can come across as being like the police and too aggressive.
4581940	4591940	And we as people of color, we want to be protected, but we don't need that aggressive type of behavior, i.e. like a militant who is protecting us.
4592940	4611940	But I feel it's important that, yes, if we are, you know, wanting to talk that there is some sort of protection, and from people, protecting people of color, to protect people of color,
4611940	4619940	to protect people of color, to protect people of color, to protect people of color, to protect people of color, to protect people of color, no matter what they say.
4620940	4633940	So, you know, and that way, definitely, but, to outright try to antagonize them, so that they're, you know, they're in their face and shouting really horrible things to them,
4633940	4637380	that I can't see will be a good thing
4637380	4639380	because to the outside world,
4639380	4640980	it will just be hate to hate.
4642420	4645100	And we don't want to hate to hate
4645100	4647100	because they'll just say you're just as bad
4647100	4648860	as those with disappearances.
4650060	4651300	So that's a problem,
4651300	4654920	but they definitely need to be comprending
4654920	4656580	the sense of control.
4659740	4661820	I think that's all right.
4663980	4666140	I'm definitely in favor.
4666980	4669100	I don't think we should be screaming obscenities
4669100	4672260	or yelling things or dehumanizing them,
4672260	4673740	but I think it's important
4673740	4675460	that we should be standing there telling them
4675460	4677380	that we don't accept white supremacy,
4677380	4680100	that we are not going to accept these types of behaviors
4680100	4681780	and that these aren't the kind of people
4681780	4683900	or the kinds of ideologies that we want here
4683900	4685320	and that they're not okay.
4685320	4688460	The hate speech is not a phrase of the future.
4688460	4691060	And that killing people for how they're born
4691060	4693420	or their faith or their nationality,
4693780	4695860	any of that is just absolute bullshit.
4695860	4700340	And I think it's important that we make that clear
4700340	4704040	within making ourselves look like a bunch of bullies.
4704040	4705340	That's not the intent,
4705340	4707540	but we can still have a confrontational,
4707540	4710100	no, you're lying, you're not telling the facts.
4711020	4714060	Immigrants are good for our economy.
4714060	4715860	They do all these things for us.
4715860	4719400	People of color are all throughout our history.
4719400	4722100	They've been here longer than many of the white people
4722140	4723460	have ever heard.
4724740	4726480	And enough is enough.
4728020	4730900	I'm definitely in favor of a confrontational
4730900	4733980	about looking to go into fights or call names,
4733980	4737020	but I do think we need to call them out on their ideology.
4737020	4738460	And if I can add onto that,
4738460	4741140	I think that's what having two groups of people
4741140	4742820	does really well in terms of having people
4742820	4744500	that are fighting people know what's happening
4744500	4745700	as you're going by,
4745700	4747700	because you are really controlling the message
4747700	4749220	because you do get that spin where it's like,
4749220	4751620	oh, someone's confronting Nazis, they're bad people.
4752020	4753980	And you can say, no, okay, here's where we disagree.
4753980	4755620	Here's where we disagree with them.
4755620	4757360	This is what we're doing.
4757360	4760020	This is what we think society needs to be like,
4760020	4761660	and we'd really like it if you could get on board.
4761660	4763540	And if the kind of things you're putting forward,
4763540	4767420	you know, anti-racism, anti-fascism, anti-Islamophobia,
4767420	4772420	anti-Semitism, those are things
4773820	4775220	that everyone can get on board with.
4775220	4777940	And if you do a good job of communicating that message,
4777940	4779860	I think you can walk in true gum.
4779900	4782540	You can make sure that the fascists aren't speaking out
4782540	4784340	and you can make sure that they're not getting energy,
4784340	4785900	they're not getting strength,
4785900	4789580	and you can quite frankly make them uncomfortable,
4789580	4792180	make them not feel welcome
4792180	4796400	while also not coming off as thugs,
4796400	4798620	not coming off as the bad guys.
4801980	4806220	Yeah, in terms of definitively capital-testing
4806220	4810220	and failing, I feel like it's extremely important
4810220	4812620	to also have a large valley of people who are just saying,
4812620	4815060	we are just here for peace, we are just here against hate,
4815060	4818180	we are just here to love, we are just here to come together
4818180	4821100	because it is important for people to be able to see that,
4821100	4824380	but there also does need to be a certain group of people
4824380	4825780	that are standing up saying,
4825780	4828580	we are not going to sit down and let us be attacked.
4828580	4830740	We're not gonna sit down and let our Eastern friends
4830740	4833980	and our families and our brothers and sisters and neighbors
4833980	4836940	be attacked because you can be at a peaceful rally
4836940	4839180	doing absolutely nothing wrong, not throwing anything,
4839180	4840740	not doing anything, not yelling anything,
4840740	4842260	that's not gonna mean they're not gonna
4842260	4844340	still ride a van into you.
4844340	4846500	You could just be minding your own business
4846500	4847980	but they will still attack you,
4847980	4850740	and when they do it, the other Nazis are gonna go,
4850740	4853060	that guy wasn't one of us, no.
4853060	4854700	It was who told you not a Nazi attack
4854700	4857620	and just a random attack that has happened to me
4857620	4859180	at a anti-Nazi rally by a guy
4859180	4861500	who may or may not have been one of us, I don't know,
4861500	4864540	but the fact is that they are disparate groups.
4864540	4868380	The thing that they have to tell them is that they all hate.
4868380	4869820	They don't all agree on the same things.
4869820	4871100	They don't all agree on their politics.
4871100	4872420	They don't all agree on who they hate
4872420	4874900	or how they hate them or why they hate them.
4874900	4877220	They all just hate and they're angry
4877220	4880940	and they wanna lash out at something.
4880940	4882740	So they're just lashing out, who are their things,
4882740	4883860	easiest who are their things,
4883860	4886340	eat whoever is gonna take it,
4886340	4890220	and if people aren't standing up,
4890220	4891700	then they're gonna think that they can
4891700	4893340	continue to get away with things.
4893340	4894980	They can continue hurting people
4894980	4898140	and they just get to retreat back into their own.
4898140	4899100	Did I say I was a Nazi?
4899100	4900460	I just said I was a Nazi, yeah.
4900460	4902060	Nobody's upcoming to their homes
4902060	4904140	and sprinting into their houses.
4904140	4906580	Nobody's throwing birds through their windows
4906580	4908140	and threatening their families.
4909100	4912220	I don't have to go rallying for that to happen to me.
4912220	4914660	I could just be walking down the street.
4914660	4915500	They know.
4915500	4916900	We've been attacked in bars.
4916900	4919380	We've had to be able to do the racism on the street here
4919420	4921020	on a regular basis.
4921020	4924860	I was recently attacked in my home by my roommate's sister
4924860	4926500	who was actually from out of town
4926500	4928980	and not only did the police refuse to press charges
4928980	4930460	because it was my work against terrorism,
4930460	4932100	but then they turned around and asked her
4932100	4933460	if I was from out of town.
4934660	4937380	It was the only person they asked where they were from
4937380	4938820	was her, yeah.
4938820	4942060	Both the roommate and her sister were both recovered.
4942060	4944620	I've been a leader for over 20 years, over 20 years,
4945820	4948660	but that's still what's happening to me.
4948820	4949660	I called the cops.
4949660	4950820	I said, I've been attacked.
4950820	4952300	They got their little bow.
4953540	4954940	Did you, though?
4954940	4956300	I think they could even write the name
4956300	4959220	of the woman who attacked her on the police report.
4960820	4965340	And that's just a day-to-day kind of thing for you to grow.
4967100	4968620	People just aren't safe here.
4970020	4970860	Dan?
4971900	4974660	I'm in favor of the confrontation.
4974660	4977100	Really, I'd love to know what that is about.
4977100	4979380	We do have to be safe.
4980820	4985820	We can obviously assess the situation that day
4989020	4992540	and if the numbers are on ourselves,
4992540	4997540	not to say attack, but just to,
4997540	5001540	I mean, I think we'll totally tell each other
5001540	5006540	that we know what the boundaries are
5006780	5008020	and the limits are.
5010900	5014220	But I would definitely sign it forward
5014220	5019220	and we'll direct and properly protest.
5024700	5029700	Being smart about it, not the term,
5031500	5034260	all of us, but I was thinking that we,
5034300	5036900	for the last couple of months,
5040100	5045100	it's a really, it's just a really fucked up time right now.
5046580	5051580	We have to, we have to have good strategy
5054060	5059060	to not get bumped into people in the U.S.
5059060	5064060	People in the U.S., also, propagated.
5066100	5071100	So, you know, I guess I'd rather go for a confrontation.
5072700	5076100	Sorry, to clarify that, I do mean on the other,
5076100	5078180	fully non-aggressive, like counter-contrasting,
5078180	5081060	like counter-message, being on the sidewalks
5081060	5083900	in front of a bar, but not going into the crowd.
5083900	5086140	We don't need to be two inches from our face.
5086140	5087660	Exactly, we need to yell at them.
5087660	5089740	We need to talk to the people walking by.
5089740	5091380	We don't need to yell at them.
5091380	5093740	I'm not sure if I think that I've been met that.
5093740	5098740	I just meant, you know, if there's enough people
5099060	5100820	and everyone is feeling safe,
5100820	5103780	that maybe we can get closer
5103780	5107260	and not try to instigate violence by any means,
5107260	5111060	but I think that there's more of a direct message
5111060	5116060	that you can visibly see, you know,
5118020	5120540	more people, like in Vancouver,
5120540	5124340	like in Boston, a few weeks ago, too, or whatever.
5127660	5130700	Yeah, I don't necessarily think,
5130700	5132980	I don't necessarily think across the street,
5132980	5134580	if across the street's what we can do,
5134580	5135860	then across the street's what we can do,
5135860	5138220	but if the score is what we can do,
5138220	5140740	then the score is what we can do, so.
5140740	5143540	And I think, again, it's something we'll have to assess.
5143540	5144380	Chris?
5144380	5145700	I think the problem we're gonna have
5145700	5149660	with actually doing a cabinet protest
5149660	5151660	is the commuter counting.
5154020	5156100	There are a whole pedagogy of hate,
5156100	5159580	so if you're gonna get started talking, I'm talking to them.
5159580	5161540	It's just you become shouting much,
5161540	5163380	which means both parties are just starting
5163380	5164860	to talk to each other.
5164860	5167260	I mean, if you want to take an example,
5167260	5170540	you can pass this to revolutionary or one of those Jesus
5171140	5174140	John Lennon, Donny, they were all killed
5174140	5175500	because they were pacifists, right?
5175500	5177980	So make sure they're not being preached love and hate,
5177980	5180100	but they also didn't really truly stand up
5180100	5181820	for a lot of things, right?
5181820	5184420	So they do need to have that type of stance
5184420	5186220	where you're gonna say, well, there's certain things
5186220	5187540	I'm not gonna stand up for.
5189660	5193340	But with, I mean, knowledge and power,
5193340	5195580	so we don't have to treat it to an idea
5195580	5197260	that needs to have a better idea.
5197500	5200300	So if you're trying to confront hate,
5200300	5201780	you need to speak about love
5201780	5204220	and actually speak on the behalf of them.
5204220	5207500	Why fascism is a negative idea,
5207500	5210980	why separating people is a negative concept,
5210980	5213220	and they all are inclusive, right?
5213220	5217740	So I just think if you are willing to do a counter protest
5217740	5221140	and counter this guy in particular,
5222140	5223220	with a degree of certainty,
5223220	5225060	you just need a negative idea.
5225300	5227420	With a degree of certainty, it's just gonna get negative.
5227420	5228580	It's just gonna get a negative match
5228580	5231420	and you're just gonna make yourself look bad.
5231420	5234340	So if you're going to counter productive
5234340	5236540	or counter the protest,
5236540	5238620	you've gotta attack the people who have good means
5238620	5241860	most to them, that's the people walking by,
5241860	5244220	which is basically getting them this information.
5244220	5245980	Sure, this guy's in here preaching hate,
5245980	5248020	but let me give you the alternative.
5248020	5250740	Why fascism is bad, why hating people
5250740	5252780	for different races and different colors is for great,
5252780	5254700	why it's bad, because then you're just gonna make him
5255220	5258460	look like a fool, and then that guy will go to the protest
5258460	5260220	by actually showing people that the guy's
5260220	5261860	a complete fucking moron,
5261860	5263660	and here's how we're gonna do it.
5264540	5266580	I think that's the final take on it.
5268460	5271180	I would say that it's pretty scary
5271180	5274380	that the city would let violent racists
5274380	5276580	organize something like that.
5276580	5281580	It's like we don't wanna be the ones
5281620	5284020	to instigate the violence, obviously,
5284020	5288700	but we obviously can't let them sell the message, right?
5288700	5292740	So we do need to find a way to divert the traffic.
5292740	5297740	The only thing about that is if they violently,
5299340	5301500	what do we do to stop that, right?
5303580	5305540	Make sure to keep it collective, right?
5306540	5307380	Yeah.
5310100	5312500	Jordan, can I have a comment?
5312500	5314500	I feel like a lot of the discussion we've been having
5314500	5317420	are getting into this notion of what being confrontational
5317420	5320620	actually means as far as practical implications,
5320620	5323060	and it's the kind of thing that I think we're all happy
5323060	5325100	with by understanding the fact that we don't want
5325100	5328620	to go start punching these people in the face is unwarranted.
5328620	5331620	You don't want to be the people that begin to get
5331620	5333340	that violence, but you also have to be prepared
5333340	5335060	for the fact these people are going to be violent
5335460	5336580	towards you.
5336580	5338460	You have to be prepared to defend yourselves,
5338460	5342660	and this confrontation and militancy,
5342660	5346300	that word that this kind of organization you want to have,
5346300	5350820	it's not a notion of going and trying
5350820	5352420	to instigate with these people.
5352420	5354500	We're not trying to get these people certified.
5354500	5356460	What we want is that we want to make sure
5356460	5358380	that they don't get the message out there,
5358380	5360700	and we want to make sure that they're denied
5360700	5362300	any sort of gains that they could get
5362300	5364440	from organizing like this.
5364680	5369680	So there needs to be a discussion at some point
5370000	5373120	about what confrontation militancy actually means
5373120	5374680	as far as practical discussions,
5374680	5378280	but I think we all kind of have a understanding here
5378280	5380680	where it's not going out to these people,
5380680	5383200	screaming slurs in their face and trying to start a fight.
5383200	5386560	It's defending our gains and making sure
5386560	5391480	that we can operate safely and help educate other people.
5391480	5394560	But it's also knowing you're having it too, right?
5394560	5396640	And because they preach hate,
5396640	5399720	they're going to use hate as an intimidation factor
5399720	5401520	to get their message across as a whole.
5401520	5403080	That's the whole premise of it.
5403080	5404600	If you avoid that altogether,
5404600	5407800	and just instantly use their hate against them,
5407800	5409680	they're more than equal,
5409680	5410800	rather than actually going out
5410800	5412400	and actually confronting them.
5414000	5415600	Because they're trying to spread their message,
5415600	5416960	so that's their idea,
5416960	5419600	so that you simply just say, that's their idea,
5419600	5421880	here's the flip side of that idea,
5421880	5423200	that's a better idea,
5423200	5425080	which makes them look like a fool.
5425080	5426880	You also have to be prepared for the fact that
5426880	5428640	I'm not saying to be prepared,
5428640	5429640	I'm just saying, well,
5429640	5432840	if you start to have engaging them
5432840	5435040	in that kind of conversation,
5435040	5436720	with a certain degree of certainty,
5436720	5438080	it's going to get better.
5442040	5442880	Oh, yes, sorry.
5444600	5447520	So I'm also okay with confrontation.
5448520	5449920	I don't think we necessarily,
5451680	5453760	yeah, I don't know, I'm on for confrontation.
5453760	5457920	I think that these people should feel that they
5457920	5460040	cannot organize here successfully.
5460040	5464520	If they leave that rally feeling like it was a success,
5464520	5465720	I think we failed.
5465720	5470560	And I think that we need to make them leave that day,
5471840	5474520	feeling like if they want to do that again,
5474520	5475960	it will be a struggle.
5477680	5480360	And I think confrontation is the way to be met.
5480360	5482720	I think if we don't come up with it,
5482720	5484880	it will leave that day,
5484880	5486440	having had people come up to them,
5486440	5489760	having had people feel comfortable coming up to them,
5489760	5492880	having felt like they got their message out there,
5493760	5496040	regardless of,
5499160	5500400	yeah, regardless of anything else,
5500400	5501920	I think if they are not confronted,
5501920	5503800	they will leave feeling empowered.
5503800	5506560	And that is the last thing you want in your community,
5506600	5508800	is a bunch of Nazis feeling empowered.
5510320	5512600	And I think confrontation is the way to make them feel
5512600	5513960	like they do not have power,
5513960	5515560	because they do not have power.
5516720	5520120	But ignoring them or allowing them to spread their message
5521080	5523240	will lead them to believe that they do.
5525160	5527080	Can I just say something that I'm going to leave?
5527080	5528560	Yeah.
5528560	5532200	Just so that we're also going to have
5532200	5537200	a group of people taking pictures,
5537360	5541320	because we do want to have these pictures,
5541320	5542920	and we're going to be posting the pictures
5542920	5546120	of these single Nazis all over the internet,
5546120	5547360	according to them.
5547360	5550640	And the police, if they say anything like,
5550640	5552200	kill the Jews or kill the black,
5552200	5555080	I think that's considered a hate crime,
5555080	5558600	and they could be charged.
5558600	5561480	So we will definitely have cameras and stuff
5562320	5563680	but I got them.
5563680	5566640	But thanks for organizing with us.
5566640	5569480	And we'll definitely see you guys on Saturday.
5569480	5570320	Yeah, sure.
5570320	5571480	Okay, take care.
5571480	5572320	Thank you.
5572320	5573160	See you.
5573160	5574000	Bye.
5576080	5581080	Well, okay, so I think effectively there,
5581480	5583920	everyone on the table said they do, to some degree,
5583920	5587920	want to do something separate from across the road,
5587920	5592920	lock off the Nazis from the public kind of thing.
5594880	5596240	My understanding going around the table
5596240	5598760	is everyone is on board with at least having
5598760	5600520	something on the sidewalk that makes it
5600520	5602000	so that the Nazis are not busy
5602000	5604400	when you drive down George Street and look right.
5605920	5610880	Past that, I think there are different points going on.
5610880	5613600	I'm not sure if we actually have enough
5613600	5617240	logistical information in order to make a call
5617240	5620720	on what we do past that because like a couple of you
5620720	5622520	both said, if it's the 10 of us,
5622520	5624520	that's very different than if 40 people show up,
5624520	5626480	very different than 100 people show up.
5627640	5632640	But the question is still, are people comfortable
5632840	5636320	with the idea that we would lock off the Nazis?
5636320	5638600	And to answer your point, I think you're right
5638600	5640440	that if you get into the shouting match back and forth
5640440	5643080	with them, you make an asset both of yourselves.
5643080	5645160	And in any action I've ever done,
5645160	5648080	the strategy has never been to like start yelling back
5648080	5650480	before the Nazis because they know some pretty foul things
5650480	5652920	and can just yell at you, but you can show it over them.
5652920	5656560	You can just be like, just chant, don't respond.
5656560	5658160	Like no matter what they do,
5658160	5659360	they can say whatever they want,
5659360	5661240	just Stonewall them kind of thing.
5661240	5665080	And then just chant, chant, chant,
5665080	5666600	so that they can show themselves
5666600	5669360	of course all kinds of profanities and terrible things.
5669360	5672400	And no one can know what they're saying.
5672400	5675880	And the important part is that we're educating people
5675880	5677480	because the best way to crush fascists
5677480	5679680	is to organize their place of undermoon.
5681480	5682800	So this is sort of all just a rut,
5682800	5684200	like we're yelling them to shut the rally down
5684200	5685280	so they can't propagandize,
5685280	5687960	but our real work getting done is community organizing
5687960	5689760	is getting the community together.
5692400	5693800	I feel like a lot of people would also
5693800	5695640	feel unsupportiveness in the ocean
5695640	5700480	in terms of fighting hate, ignorance, disinformation.
5700480	5702040	Like the idea that we're gambling,
5702040	5704440	that we're spreading real information
5704440	5708160	is it's not just saying Nazis are bad, fascism is bad.
5708160	5711080	But that we're not just coming out to say,
5711080	5712480	screw these guys, we're gonna be like,
5712480	5715400	listen, the problem they're talking about are real problems,
5715400	5717480	but this is not how we fight these problems.
5717480	5719240	I mean, I'm just saying that we're not trying
5719240	5721400	to just trust them, that we're fighting ignorance,
5721400	5724640	that we're fighting hate, that we're spreading information
5724640	5727080	to better people's lives.
5727080	5732080	So we catch it as a positive counter protest, basically.
5735840	5740840	Yeah, so do we want to call a rally
5742240	5746560	or across the street publicly and advertise for that,
5747480	5750760	not committing ourselves to anything more than that,
5750760	5753960	quite frankly committing ourselves to anything publicly
5753960	5756560	that could be illegal is always a bad idea.
5757080	5762080	But with the knowledge that the plan is to block
5767400	5771080	the Nazis off and if possible, shut them down
5771080	5773240	in terms of basically make it so the public
5773240	5775160	can't get access to them and they cannot get access
5775160	5776000	to the public.
5778000	5780320	Although, yeah, okay, go ahead.
5780320	5782600	My concern is that we can't have protection
5782600	5783840	in those terms, but that's what we want to do,
5783840	5785440	is have protection in those terms.
5785440	5787680	As we presented, we're trying to shut down
5787680	5790280	their ability to spread information
5790280	5792480	and if we're trying to halt free speech,
5792480	5793760	then once again, we're putting ourselves
5793760	5796200	in a position to be bad guys.
5796200	5798200	Right, that's one way.
5798200	5800560	I mean, I don't know if that's one way or the other.
5800560	5802200	Just because I've heard that a few times
5802200	5803880	that I haven't been ruining it.
5803880	5806600	Yeah, we were talking about we don't want to push hate.
5806600	5808560	The rest of us, we don't want to put in that.
5808560	5811160	But just like, it's how we state the message,
5811160	5812920	not just what we're trying to do.
5812920	5814720	Yeah, and I think the thing is that we have
5814720	5815920	to do shit in their mind.
5815920	5817960	Is that when we talk about tactics
5817960	5820560	and what we do physically in the real world,
5820560	5823040	like what we're doing, I think these things
5823040	5826160	have a political character that aren't dependent
5826160	5828240	on what the actual tactic is, right?
5828240	5829080	Because we can talk all day about,
5829080	5831720	is it fascist to do this?
5831720	5834760	And the reality is that fascists have a direct set
5834760	5836040	of political goals and political aims
5836040	5837520	that we don't have, right?
5837520	5838720	When we talk about fascists and we say,
5838720	5842760	hey, what do you think about shutting us down?
5842760	5844200	They would agree with shutting us down,
5845040	5848160	but they would also agree with genocide and FSI
5848160	5851360	and mass deportation, whereas we don't, right?
5851360	5853240	When we envision a totally different world
5853240	5855120	than they envisioned, our political goals
5855120	5857400	and our aims are totally different from theirs
5857400	5861240	just because we happen to also agree with shutting them down
5861240	5862680	I don't think it draws a world
5862680	5864400	that we don't see between the two of us.
5864400	5865720	They have a definite set of aims,
5865720	5867800	we have a definite set of aims.
5867800	5870080	They're going to push for theirs and we can push for ours,
5870080	5874760	but the reality is that if we don't adopt these tactics,
5874760	5876840	they're going to lose them because they're going to do it.
5876840	5879120	They're not worried about drawing moral equivalency.
5879120	5879960	They're just going to do it.
5879960	5880800	They're just going to kill people.
5880800	5883520	They're just going to take state power.
5883520	5885560	We should probably meet them where they're at.
5885560	5887880	Okay, so what about the adoption of the tactics?
5887880	5889880	Does the adoption be a message,
5889880	5891680	like the whole point is that they're able
5891680	5892680	to get away with being Nazis
5892680	5894360	because they're saying, I'm not a Nazi.
5894360	5895600	They're allowed to get away with this
5895600	5897160	and go get a raise in the American Union
5897160	5898320	because they're saying, I'm not doing that
5898320	5900040	even as they're doing it.
5900920	5902320	We live in a world where people say
5902320	5905000	that Black Lives Matter is a terrorist group
5905000	5907120	because they're arguing that black people
5907120	5910080	shouldn't be getting shot all the time.
5910080	5913120	We live in a world where people can swallow any message.
5913120	5915920	Like I've had friends, those friends,
5915920	5917040	who I know have not been racist,
5917040	5919360	who have said, well, all lives matter.
5919360	5922160	And I'm like, yeah, buddy, that's the point.
5922160	5923920	Black lives matter, all lives matter.
5923920	5925640	All lives matter, including black lives.
5925640	5927320	There's nothing wrong with Black Lives Matter
5927320	5928600	if all lives matter.
5929080	5930160	I didn't hear you saying anything
5930160	5932440	about all lives mattering with this guy who's killed
5932440	5935000	until somebody said Black Lives Matter.
5935000	5937520	But that same thing is that people
5937520	5939000	who they're just overhearing
5939000	5941640	is the message, the headline.
5941640	5943440	They're gonna read a headline saying,
5943440	5946120	anti-fascists try to shut down a rally
5946120	5949880	instead of having the protesters spreading information.
5949880	5952840	I guess if we present ourselves as the enemy,
5952840	5955840	then they use that same argument themselves.
5955840	5957160	And when they're recruiting,
5957200	5959760	that's what they use to paint us as the enemy.
5959760	5962120	To say that when we're the real terrorists here,
5962120	5963320	we're the ones who would actually
5963320	5964880	try to shut down free speech.
5966120	5968520	So if we just say we're just getting more information,
5968520	5970280	we're getting additional information from them
5970280	5974080	to shut them down, even if that's actually what we are.
5974080	5975640	Mr. Stewart, you wanna,
5975640	5978360	yeah, like, kind of like, jumping off the thing
5978360	5983040	that you said about the political cover that we're,
5983760	5987920	maybe think about how it's not just our politics,
5987920	5991520	sort of fascist politics that creates
5994280	5995800	what people can perceive it as,
5995800	5997760	but it's like there's political interests
5997760	6002200	that are shaping how that information's being put out,
6002200	6003240	like the narrative of it,
6003240	6008240	like maybe fascists being just bad or whatever.
6008960	6011840	That's also, like, there's a political interest
6012280	6017280	in delegitimizing any actor that's not a police officer,
6017720	6022280	more like a mayor, more like courts and that kind of thing.
6022280	6024520	These are the only places where this fight should happen,
6024520	6028680	according to the state and media and stuff.
6028680	6032920	And so, and otherwise,
6032920	6036680	just people having grounds for any kind of perspective,
6037680	6038520	it's like,
6040920	6043160	within that political context,
6043160	6045320	it's acceptable to a degree,
6045320	6047360	as long as it doesn't turn into
6048760	6052200	them actualizing their thing directly.
6052200	6054840	If they put it through the state,
6054840	6059840	if he puts genocidal policies into,
6060320	6063400	or immigration policies into power,
6063480	6065080	then that's still fine,
6065080	6066600	because it's just using the machinery
6066600	6068680	that's already there,
6068680	6072520	and it's not like seeing that it's a problem,
6072520	6075160	but when you have people in the community there
6075160	6077320	trying to directly stop something,
6077320	6080920	it's really easy to present it as,
6082800	6084800	and also not saying that we should,
6085960	6089280	like, I think I agree that we should mitigate how,
6089280	6092240	do try to mitigate perception stuff.
6092560	6095160	Do try to mitigate perception stuff.
6095160	6098120	Do try to mitigate perception stuff.
6098120	6101080	Do try to mitigate perception stuff.
6101080	6107320	Do try to mitigate perception stuff.
6107320	6110040	Do try to mitigate perception stuff.
6110040	6113000	Do try to mitigate perception stuff.
6113000	6115960	Do try to mitigate perception stuff.
6115960	6118520	Do try to mitigate perception stuff.
