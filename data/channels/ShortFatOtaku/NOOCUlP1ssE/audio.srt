00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Hey guys, Dev here, and I've got something special for you today.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,980
What this is, is an hour and 40 minutes of an internal Antifa meeting.

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:14,000
Apparently someone from the Politically Incorrect board over at 8chan managed to sneak in and

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,260
record this.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,820
And just to make sure that it doesn't get wiped off the face of the internet, I'm uploading

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,500
it to my channel along with relevant timestamps to interesting bits.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,940
In my opinion, the best bit is around an hour and 10 minutes in, where they basically admit

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,320
that they're out there to incite violence.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,680
This might be what we need to get a legal conviction or something along those lines

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,120
against the people behind groups like Antifa and BAM.

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,940
Alright guys, happy listening.

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,440
I love you.

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:26,940
I remember cutting these off so well.

14
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:54,940
Happy listening.

15
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:22,940
Happy listening.

16
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:50,940
Hey, how are you guys doing?

17
00:02:50,940 --> 00:03:15,940
Nice to meet you.

18
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,940
How did you guys hear about this?

19
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,940
There was a sign outside of work.

20
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,940
Oh, shit.

21
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,940
Where was, uh...

22
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,940
Nordea.

23
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,940
Oh, a little bit Nordea.

24
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,940
Yeah, it was scary stuff.

25
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,940
You saw that.

26
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,940
I had no idea, to be honest.

27
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,940
I came to Peterborough like a year ago.

28
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,940
I was in Kitchener, Waterloo before that.

29
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,940
Scary stuff.

30
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,940
Yeah.

31
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,940
This is... Kevin's been around for a long time.

32
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,940
Uh, at least a few years.

33
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,940
I guess he started noticing him maybe like three years ago.

34
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,940
I think he started to do events maybe just in the last year?

35
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,940
Yeah.

36
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,940
As far as I can tell.

37
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,940
I've seen like other people.

38
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:13,940
There's like maybe a couple of neo-Nazi looking types that I've seen like maybe once or twice.

39
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,940
They like come and go, you know?

40
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,940
Yeah.

41
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,940
Yeah.

42
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,940
I've seen similar downtown.

43
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,940
You walk in the street, they'll talk about that.

44
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,940
Yeah, I guess the trouble is you don't really know.

45
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,940
Unless you see up close and like some of their representatives

46
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,940
start to like know for sure what they're concerned with.

47
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,940
Yeah.

48
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,940
Yeah, because I mean you do get like kind of able to go like

49
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,940
rush people or something around.

50
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,940
You don't want to yell at somebody and be like,

51
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,940
oh shit, they're a comrade.

52
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,940
They're actually anti-racist too.

53
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,940
Yeah.

54
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,940
Yeah.

55
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,940
Yeah.

56
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:51,940
How about you folks, like was this a big thing where you were previously kind of thing?

57
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,940
I don't really know that much about it, to be honest with you.

58
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,940
I just saw it and I saw the ad out there.

59
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,940
I looked up the page and I thought, yeah, I should probably learn some more about that.

60
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,940
Sure.

61
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,940
I'm saying the same for yourself.

62
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,940
Yeah.

63
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,940
Yeah.

64
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,940
You've been in Peterborough for a while?

65
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,940
Yeah.

66
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,940
Yeah.

67
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,940
Yeah.

68
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,940
Is this pretty new to Peterborough?

69
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,940
No, no.

70
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,940
I've been to Buckhorn and stuff.

71
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,940
Oh.

72
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,940
And I'm from the area, right?

73
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,940
Yeah.

74
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,940
So I was in Peterborough for work, so.

75
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,940
Oh, okay.

76
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,940
We're roommates.

77
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,940
Anywhere we go, we're going to have both of you.

78
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,940
Yeah.

79
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:32,940
Yeah, we're going to have to figure out what needs to happen here.

80
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,940
I'm hoping, as I know Mikey, who was at the meeting, one of those said he was coming tonight

81
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,940
to talk to a fellow named Seth.

82
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,940
He said he'd be coming tonight.

83
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,940
We'll see if there's more people coming.

84
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,940
Oh, awesome.

85
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,940
Excellent.

86
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,940
Hello?

87
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,940
Mikey?

88
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,940
Yeah?

89
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,940
Mikey?

90
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,940
Yeah?

91
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,940
Maybe he's going to have a second baby here.

92
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,940
Yeah.

93
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,940
Yeah, like a positive ideation or whatever.

94
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,940
Yeah?

95
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,940
Yeah.

96
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,940
Build it and they will come.

97
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,940
Yeah.

98
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,940
Yeah.

99
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,940
There is a bit of water there.

100
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,940
I like it.

101
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,940
I like it.

102
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,940
Sort of a condition of like a cardiac?

103
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,940
Yeah.

104
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:52,940
It's sales, right?

105
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,940
So it can be pretty frustrating because of that.

106
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,940
It's not here nor there.

107
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,940
It's not awful.

108
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,940
Yeah.

109
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,940
It has to be because you're doing a lot of negativity.

110
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,940
Yeah.

111
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,940
Yeah.

112
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,940
Yeah, that tends to happen with a lot of people.

113
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,940
Yeah.

114
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,940
Yeah.

115
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,940
There's always so much yelling that you can take.

116
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,940
Things won't fuck off and go shoot yourself.

117
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,940
Yeah.

118
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,940
Yeah.

119
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,940
Yeah.

120
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,940
You need development.

121
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,940
I'm just kidding.

122
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,940
Yeah.

123
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,940
Yeah.

124
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,940
I've been looking around.

125
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,940
I've been looking around the last couple of weeks to be honest with you.

126
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,940
Yeah.

127
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,940
It's been your last five or eight?

128
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,940
Yeah.

129
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,940
How long have you been out here?

130
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,940
Almost a year.

131
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,940
Almost a year.

132
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,940
Probably 18 months.

133
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,940
Yeah.

134
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,940
That's two years.

135
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,940
Yeah.

136
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,940
A bit pretty hydrated over there.

137
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,940
Oh, yeah.

138
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,940
There's a lot.

139
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,940
There's a room.

140
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,940
Yeah.

141
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,940
Yeah.

142
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,940
You have a lot of summer kids and stuff like that, but there's a lot of turnover.

143
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,940
I mean, there's, from when I did my training class, there were only three people left.

144
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,940
It was like, that training class was like 30.

145
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,940
Yeah.

146
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,940
Yeah.

147
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,940
Yeah.

148
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,940
Yeah.

149
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,940
Yeah.

150
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,940
In case people live here, it would be like that.

151
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,940
Not in shock.

152
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,940
Yeah.

153
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,940
Yeah.

154
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,940
I'm actually the only one left in my training class out of 10.

155
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,940
Yeah.

156
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,940
Pretty much here.

157
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,940
Yeah.

158
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,940
So.

159
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,940
Gotta do it.

160
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,940
Awesome.

161
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,940
Can I just throw a little repeating on them?

162
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,940
Okay.

163
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,940
I might watch the last minute.

164
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,940
In here?

165
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,940
Let's go.

166
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,940
Spits up one second.

167
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,940
Okay.

168
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:12,940
Okay, if you want to grab a glass of water, there's some water there for me and then you can go once.

169
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,940
That's washing back that way, right?

170
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,940
Sort of?

171
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,940
Yeah, sort of.

172
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:31,940
Alright, well, we need to get back at seven now, so we might as well get started and, you know, see what comes of it.

173
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,940
People trickle in, trickle in.

174
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,940
Well, we'll wait for Mike to get back.

175
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,940
Yeah, that's right.

176
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,940
We'll go to the washroom and then start talking.

177
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,940
It's not very calm right at the office.

178
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,940
Alright.

179
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,940
I know. Like, was that?

180
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,940
Yeah, I didn't know.

181
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,940
I kind of felt like they had that under control.

182
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,940
It looks a little weird.

183
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,940
I know they wanted to do it.

184
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,940
Yeah.

185
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,940
I don't know. Did anyone else do another one?

186
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,940
I think you did.

187
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,940
Yeah, there's definitely two different strategies in terms of approach.

188
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,940
Okay.

189
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,940
So, it's not the happiness Monday evening?

190
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,940
Well, not quite as much, maybe.

191
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:16,940
They're talking about, I think that we talked them into not coming up, but they were talking about not doing anything Saturday and having a Sunday day of celebration of the revolution and something to show the Nazis they were wrong.

192
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,940
Awesome. That's kind of quite a word.

193
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,940
Alright.

194
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:34,940
So, I guess, yeah, on that point, Kevin Goudreau announced his rally, I think, on the 7th or 8th.

195
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:40,940
In the 11 days since then, there's been a bunch of different kinds of organizing happening.

196
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:48,940
Maybe just in terms of what we know about Kevin, just go around the table and kind of get that on the table.

197
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,940
I know he's the leader of the Canadian Nationalist Front.

198
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:04,940
Near as I can tell, the Canadian Nationalist Front doesn't consist of a huge amount of people other than Kevin Goudreau and some friends, it would seem.

199
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,940
But he does have support of some, but not all, of the white nationalists across the country.

200
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:27,940
He's alienated from Storm Alliance, which is a fairly large new group that broke away from the soldiers' vote, which in turn, they started from a Finnish group that is hardcore neo-Nazi fascist types.

201
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,940
Killed someone last year.

202
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,940
Yeah, killed someone last year.

203
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,940
So, Storm Alliance is disavowing Kevin Goudreau publicly.

204
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,940
Colin O'Leary, who is their main spokesman, said that.

205
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:46,940
That seems to be more along the lines that Storm Alliance is just a lot better at imaging than Kevin Goudreau is.

206
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:55,940
They're very good at putting the message forward that we're not against, we're not racist, we're just in favor of a white Canada.

207
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:09,940
So, they've done a lot better job of trying to do these kinds of actions, like they do things like work in soup kitchens or do free needle pickups to try and cover their image.

208
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:23,940
But when you look at what they're doing, they're also doing street patrols, which is what happened in Finland, where they're going along and then if they find someone they don't like because they're homeless, whatever, they beat them up.

209
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:31,940
And that started to happen in some places across the country, particularly in Quebec, where they're a lot stronger. The movement there in general is a lot stronger.

210
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:39,940
Is there anyone else in terms of what you know about Kevin? People have stuff they want to bring forward?

211
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:49,940
I just want to add, I don't know if it is public to everybody yet, but is there a location for the square?

212
00:13:49,940 --> 00:14:13,940
It might be an aspirational move on Kevin's part, where he's kind of doing a power plan saying, look, we have this massive venue, now everyone's going to show up, but I don't actually know if that means we can expect 100, 200 people.

213
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:35,940
Trying to seem more official. What I saw, he said, I've got permit in hand, so it seems he's really trying to legitimize himself in a way that he wasn't before, but it would be nice to not let him have that platform to spew his shit.

214
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,940
Anything else you want to bring forward?

215
00:14:43,940 --> 00:15:01,940
It's interesting, I think that a lot of these folks, how we approach these things is that it's very, you're talking about soup kitchens, so you don't pick up. It's kind of like how these folks start doing things, and we're kind of seeing that in Peterborough, in the Boudreau, kind of marketing this as an anti-immigration, anti-Trudeau rally.

216
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:08,940
It wasn't a good tattoo on his chest, so it's a really fun thing to look at.

217
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:22,940
You've probably had more experience with Kevin than anyone else. What's your read on him?

218
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:38,940
Well, I get the impression he's volatile, because he may be more likely when he's drunk, because he attacked a friend at the spill. He was working there, he kicked him out.

219
00:15:39,940 --> 00:16:03,940
I've had a direct conversation with him. This is another night, he had the same product, he was there, and I had a direct conversation with him. I was asking him to renounce his beliefs and this kind of thing.

220
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:17,940
It was kind of a long conversation, he kept trying to divert the conversation from that, trying to relate to me with things that we might have in common, like punk music or white music.

221
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:33,940
I kept bringing it back to the subject, and then eventually I gave him the question again, and he said that he wouldn't, and if he posed the same question to me, how would I respond to that?

222
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:46,940
I was like, okay well, you're going to have to go, if you don't, I'm going to have to see your beliefs.

223
00:16:46,940 --> 00:17:08,940
So that means, he was like, can't I just finish my beer? I'm like, no, I'm okay. So in that instance, he didn't fight back, but I also invoked the crowd that was there, because people would be outside with me.

224
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:20,940
Yeah man, I think that's cut a little bit. For sure. Yeah, so we were just talking about Kevin, what do we know about him? Kevin Monroe is the one that called the rally, I'm sure everyone's aware at this point.

225
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:29,940
And just kind of going over what we know about him, so we were just saying, can we volatile, but also not necessarily volatile.

226
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:46,940
He's been in Peterborough for three-ish years maybe, but only really actively organizing in the last year, and his group is the Canadian Nationalist Front, and then we were also saying that there's a time and place now for the meeting, or for his rally.

227
00:17:46,940 --> 00:18:12,940
Yeah, so starting at two is what I've heard, and going until 4.30, so that kind of brings us to the next question I guess, which is, what are we going to do about it?

228
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:25,940
There's a lot of different kind of talk that's happened. I guess the other question, going around the table, how many people have been involved in at least one other meeting up until this point about this?

229
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:34,940
So just kind of getting people caught up, because I know a couple of us have been at a bunch of these meetings, but other people are just building into this. So Mikey, you've been at a bunch of the meetings.

230
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,940
Do you want to go around please?

231
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,940
Maybe it's your experience with activism.

232
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:49,940
So people just want to go around, name, pronouns, and any other stuff involved from this organizing.

233
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,940
Thank you, sir.

234
00:18:52,940 --> 00:19:10,940
I'm Mikey. I go by he pronouns. I was trying to organize about the first page that I know of about the rally. Unfortunately, the difference of that approach and everything, but I happened to a few of the events.

235
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:22,940
I was there for the meeting before last, like the big one was trying to unite all of these groups, where there was a lot of talk of people wanting to do an event on Saturday.

236
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:33,940
But in that specific group, there was a lot of energy towards not addressing them or acknowledging them in order to not give them the show time.

237
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:43,940
And also a lot of talk about doing something on Sunday to celebrate the community diversity, but there's a lot of energy going on for those things.

238
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:56,940
There's also people that go to the chocolate night or something on Friday. I was thinking maybe we could talk about if they insist on continuing to do that, we could talk about a security kind of force for them.

239
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:03,940
Maybe team up with a couple of them because they would be targeted by Kevin in this group for sure.

240
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:20,940
Hello, my name is Kevin. I go by he pronouns. I have been doing anti-fascist work for a couple of years. I've been doing security work for a little bit of time now, I guess.

241
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:30,940
I haven't gone to many of the meetings for the last little while, but I do that going forward. I've been very busy with school, so that would be good.

242
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,940
Anything else? Yeah, let's go see if we'll have one.

243
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:54,940
Hi, I'm Stu. He pronouns. I've gone to a couple of meetings that have been called since the rally called by Kevin to meetings about trying to combat that rally.

244
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:13,940
I've been involved with a bit of this kind of stuff in the distant history for me. I guess in the early 90s or mid-90s in Sarnia.

245
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:31,940
There are some things that I know from that time, but it's in a different time now in terms of digital, the way that social media has changed everything.

246
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:44,940
Also, the fact that street thug is always discredited, so Nazis are trying to look different and conceal what they're doing.

247
00:21:44,940 --> 00:22:05,940
I've been to one meeting. I saw a couple of the people there. Like we were saying, it seems like there's been a lot of energy, excitement.

248
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:23,940
But at the same time, I think people are underestimating and also perhaps I think because of the political opinions, underestimating just how dangerous and persistent fascists and Nazis can be.

249
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:36,940
There's a lot of this like, well, if we just love them enough, they're going to stop being Nazis. There are people out there, if we get to them early enough and if we convince them politically because they don't hold a lot of strong political beliefs.

250
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:47,940
If we hit people on the ground first thing and say, hey Nazis are going to say black people, indigenous people, women, trans people are your enemy. That's bullshit. Your boss is your enemy.

251
00:22:47,940 --> 00:23:04,940
If you hit that first thing, maybe there's something you can convince, but you get to people like Kevin and they already kind of know what they think and it can be dangerous to just kind of let them say whatever they want for the sake of allowing free speech.

252
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:29,940
I've been to two meetings for this already and I have something to do with the fact that there's been a lot of, it's concerning that a lot of people don't want to do anything on the actual day of this event and people are really afraid of actually applying to the 94 platform and I think that's the biggest thing that we should be focusing on is the fact that it's, you're not going to stop these people from having these opinions.

253
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,940
The most important thing you do is stop them from spreading out as if there's more people.

254
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:57,940
My name is Steve. I've been to one meeting as well. I agree with everyone else that has spoken, but methods suggested by other groups will likely prove ineffective and potentially probable in the long run and it's important to do more direct actions.

255
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:10,940
I'm RJ. He, him pronouns. I didn't know this much was going on. I saw the sign out there and I just want to know if I can do more about that, to be honest.

256
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:25,940
My name is Christopher. I'm calling in from Washington. I'm calling in for dinner, basically. I don't care. I'm just getting some information. I'm trying to figure out what's going on.

257
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:34,940
Sure. Then I'm going to be doing a video about some of the things that you can do.

258
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:55,940
I know that I should learn. When I was younger, I started to realize that I was really into the racist hand names. I've gotten a lot of them for the past few years, just because I didn't know what was going on.

259
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:06,940
But, yeah, I just started hearing about all of this going on. I'm on social media very much, but I didn't see any of the signs and I feel like, you know what, it's getting to me.

260
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:22,940
I'm Crystal. I'll take just about any pronouns that are typically a share. I haven't actually gone to any meetings or anything, but I tend to be fairly active when I'm online.

261
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:31,940
Sharing these kind of meetings and social anxiety mostly has got me into it so far, but it's kind of time to stand up for a show.

262
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:54,940
Fair enough. Right now it looks like there is going to be something else going on on the day of possibly, but not in terms of actively confronting Kevin and trying to keep him from spreading his message.

263
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:12,940
Our kind of hope was that this could be a good way to start, but the other thing that we were kind of hoping to do or I was hoping to do by initiating past is the problem that this stuff will keep happening.

264
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:27,940
And although we could shut it down each time it does happen, the fact that we can only get 10 people out to a meeting kind of thing is a sign that the movement as a whole isn't particularly strong right now.

265
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:36,940
And if we're going to have the capacity to keep doing this kind of work, we're going to need to grow it.

266
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:51,940
So I guess in terms of what that kind of means, my thought of how to go forward would be that it's really important to go and try and get as big of a group of people as we can and shut Kevin down.

267
00:26:52,940 --> 00:27:01,940
But it's also important to educate all the people walking by what exactly is going on and make sure that our political message that's getting out there.

268
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:22,940
So with that in mind, for the 30th, I guess my suggestion would be we should call some sort of public rally to try and get as many people as possible to show up.

269
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:41,940
Because we don't know exactly how many people are going to bring, probably won't be more than 20, but that still means we're going to need more than 10 people to actively shut them down and stop them from getting a victory, a propaganda victory kind of thing.

270
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:47,940
And of those people, my suggestion would be some would be involved in directly hunting this.

271
00:27:48,940 --> 00:28:00,940
I don't know whether we want to directly confront him or whether we feel that's in our capacity because that has a whole separate set of risks and concerns and if people are going to do that, they need to know what they're doing.

272
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:13,940
But we can certainly make sure that he doesn't go unopposed and make sure that he isn't able to just kind of parade over wherever he wants and call it this great big victory for himself and look how much everyone here rallies behind me.

273
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:26,940
And then to that end, I think part of it would also be good is if we could get some form of propagandizing the people who are going by and make sure that every person that goes by that rally gets our message.

274
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:37,940
And here it's like, hey, here's who showed up, here's what his politics are, here's what our politics are, here's what his ideas aren't acceptable, if you agree, here's something you know you could do.

275
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,940
What are your politics?

276
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:47,940
Yeah, so that's the next step. It's the question of what are the politics in the room. So, the path.

277
00:28:48,940 --> 00:29:08,940
There hasn't been a path meeting yet, so we can draft a mandate and put those politics forward. I would suggest that the politics should be anti-fascist, anti-racist, anti-transphobia, and then also anti-capitalist.

278
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:22,940
Because if we look at it, it seems to me that a lot of the violence and the nastiness that comes from these fascists stems from basically people being frustrated with the system.

279
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:32,940
And so part of stopping fires that we have to put out is also thinking about the system and how that creates it. But we should go around the table for that.

280
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,940
Carole, do you want to start?

281
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,940
Sure.

282
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,940
I'm just trying to not always keep saying that.

283
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:50,940
I mean, in general, I would say the whole anti-hate of all kinds, like specifying this kind of hate, that kind of hate, that kind of hate, it just separates groups.

284
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:58,940
So, stating that we are anti-all hate, like any kind of hate against any kind of group, would be my first thought.

285
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:07,940
Because fascists don't differentiate who they're going to hate. They don't care if you're black or gay or trans or disabled. It doesn't matter.

286
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:15,940
I mean, they don't care what you are. I mean, you can be white, but you have Jewish heritage or a Jewish-sounding name and you're not as a Jewish.

287
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,940
We should have more of those.

288
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,940
Exactly.

289
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,940
But anti-hate belongs to us.

290
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:38,940
And then yeah, just like we're saying, basically stating that we're not the ones causing the problems that the people that they're rallying against are not the people causing the problems that they're united against.

291
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,940
But what about the problems they have? They're not caused by these people.

292
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:48,940
People who are opposed to immigration who say, oh, well, immigration people take our jobs.

293
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,940
So your problem isn't immigrants. Your problem is jobs.

294
00:30:54,940 --> 00:31:02,940
If you think that all Mexicans are rapists and all black people are drug dealers, then your problem isn't people of different color. Your problem is crime.

295
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,940
Anyone else want to go for it?

296
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:30,940
Yeah, just for inclusion and for a more equal distribution of resources and resources.

297
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:52,940
I would be more inclined to agree with Ken, I think, as far as his community. I like the idea of anti-hate, but I think it's pretty justifiable to hate Nazis.

298
00:31:52,940 --> 00:32:00,940
I don't think being against hate of all people is necessarily, I don't know if I'm wording that right, but.

299
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,940
What does it look like?

300
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,940
I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.

301
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,940
I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.

302
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,940
I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.

303
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,940
I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.

304
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,940
I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.

305
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,940
I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.

306
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,940
I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.

307
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,940
I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.

308
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,940
I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.

309
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,940
I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.

310
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,940
I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.

311
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,940
I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.

312
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,940
I don't think it's a bad thing to hate Nazis.

313
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:38,940
I think the biggest problem with trying to, like, organize people around the point of view of the media is that it's such an endless concept that it's hard to actually have a concrete understanding of what that means as far as mandates of organizing.

314
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:47,940
And that's why we thought it would actually go in and do peace analysis and say, like, we're actually against these specific things and these parts of society.

315
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:54,940
And it's nice to just be like, well, we're against the people that are being asked to do this to you.

316
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:00,940
But that's not good enough because it doesn't let us continue to organize anything beyond them.

317
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:11,940
If your structuring organization is in good response to these other political ideologies, there's no actual unity within what you're doing as an organization.

318
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:17,940
You're just simply being against the group that you perceive as being happy, wrong opinions.

319
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,940
And so there's no actual unity within an organization that does that.

320
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:30,940
But we started listening. It's often new to start saying, well, we're not just saying, you know, against, you know, racism and against, you know, transphobia.

321
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,940
Then we also have to say homophobia and religious intolerance and xenophobia.

322
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,940
And then we started listening often and asking, you know, we can say we're against all these things.

323
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:51,940
But the overall, like, it's kind of like a pride, right? Pride isn't about, like, just gay, just bi, just, you know, you don't just have a lesbian brain, just bi brain, just, you know, it's everybody.

324
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:57,940
It's a rainbow. It's everybody of all colors, of all religions. It's the whole idea of pride for everyone, pride in yourself.

325
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,940
You know, it's not even excluding straight people. It's like, hey, come be out. It's everybody. Be proud to be part of the group together.

326
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:11,940
So you can, you can be listed off individual things while also stating our overall day, like, literally an anti-hate rally.

327
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:18,940
Because there's, one thing that most people get behind is, I don't want to be a hater. Nobody wants to be a ridiculous.

328
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:24,940
You can have different kinds of negative views, but somebody can be racist and be like, oh, but I'm not sexist.

329
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,940
You know, somebody can be sexist, but whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm a homophobic.

330
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:33,940
And, like, if you're not saying you're against all things, then you're basically saying, well, then some kind of things are okay.

331
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:43,940
You know, those people are not our problem. And that's been a problem in a lot of the civil rights kind of fights over the years.

332
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:49,940
Like, you know, the feminist movement was coming along. They were saying, oh, black women are the bad guys. We don't want to make it about black people.

333
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,940
And when there was, like, black rights movement was there a limit of that, but we want to make it about color, not just about gender.

334
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:03,940
You know, with the gay rights thing, you know, a lot of times trans people are being put to death because, whoa, whoa, gay rights starts when you can bring back everyone else.

335
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:08,940
Right. So once you start putting one thing forward, you're putting another people behind you.

336
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:28,940
So I guess, like, I agree with the strategy of trying to, like, point people or, like, give people counter narratives or, like, things that would undermine the foundation of, like, for example, like,

337
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:36,940
of, like, for example, the cabinet's politics taking root and the people that are, like, passing by or whatever.

338
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:50,940
I also think that it's important to be, like, that it doesn't have to be, like, explicit or that it could be subtle as opposed to, like,

339
00:35:50,940 --> 00:36:01,940
like, having to tell people they should hate their boss instead of hating, like, people of color or immigrants or whatever.

340
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:12,940
Because, like, people, I don't think people are, like, incapable of forming their own, their own conclusion.

341
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:19,940
It's just that they have, like, they don't have enough information. They also have other people telling them what to believe as well.

342
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:40,940
And so, like, I think if we're talking about, like, producing information to distribute on this thing, then, yeah, I guess I think that the most effective information would be stuff that engages with the political ideas that he's putting forward for this rally.

343
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:50,940
And it's, like, seemingly simple as they might seem to us, but basically decimating them in a way that's, like, clear language.

344
00:36:51,940 --> 00:37:06,940
And I guess something that's, yeah, that messes up the foundation or, like, the ground that he can plant those seeds of his own ideology in,

345
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:30,940
which is also, I think it's, like, would require, like, a systemic analysis as well, but I don't think, like, it's a fine line between, like, giving people too much, like, I guess we do have an ideology or whatever, which, like, if we, yeah, once we get into, like, ideological stuff,

346
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:48,940
we're probably going to find that, like, not everyone in the room are on the same page, and for the sake of, like, being able to proceed to organize this, like, counter event, it's, we may not want to get, like, bogged down in that kind of thing.

347
00:37:49,940 --> 00:38:04,940
I think, like, I don't disagree with not hating everybody, and I also agree with the idea of, like, showing people where they're, like, giving people an alternate narrative or politics,

348
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:25,940
but I also think, like, pending, like, more time to develop a shared mandate or whatever, like, it's possible, like, it might not be possible for us to have, like, a shared mandate in a certain way, but I guess the best way to do that would be, like,

349
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:46,940
one that's, like, a really low common denominator between all of us, and that, I'm not sure if that's what we want to do for, like, long term moving forward, but at least for the sake of this, like, event, like, trying to, yeah, come up with a shared strategy,

350
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:59,940
and you are, like, jobs to do at it, and then, um, yeah, and then trying to, like, destroy the politics of, of Kevin's route, and that's improved.

351
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:13,940
So, like, yeah, like, okay, so in terms of what you're saying, so, like, I hear what you said, like, you know, we had something about propaganda as a thing of doing, which I guess, so it's like, like, each individual person can have a couple of talking points, right?

352
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:32,940
Like, like a basic argument of integration, and they say integration is bad because whatever, independence is bad because whatever, however, there are three basic points, you know, to capture that, and, you know, like, for each argument, there are a number of things they're saying in the rally, and we could have just, like, a couple of fucking points, and this is why that's not accurate, this is why that's not accurate.

353
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:51,940
Yeah, exactly, so it's, like, you don't have to make the whole rally a whole thing, you know, to put it all on the fender, but you can have individual people basically saying, like, you know, what are your concerns, you know, integration, okay, let's talk about integration, like, you know, what are your concerns, okay, racism, here's, here's what they're saying about it, and here's what's actually true.

354
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:59,940
So it doesn't have to be, like, a big essay, it doesn't have to be a big thing, but we could make just, like, a couple of bullet points for each major argument.

355
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:16,940
Yeah, sure, so yeah, I actually, I think there's a lot of value being said on both sides of the table here, I think that there's some genuine concerns about a lack of intersectionality, a lack of folks being able to show popular solidarity between the press groups.

356
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:34,940
I think that's something that we definitely need to put on the table, right, because we gotta, when we're thinking about, you know, how do we combat fascism, how do we also make sure that if the groups that are, you know, going to be attacked first are the ones who are given the political power within the movement, right?

357
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:56,940
And so I think that the answer to the question that we talked about, oh, should we say hate, or should we say, or should we, you know, take apart what precisely we're talking about, I think there's value in actually doing that, in a particular part, because we can say to people, you know, someone who's an immigrant, and say, like, yeah, like xenophobia is what's affecting you, and on an individual level, we can be like, alright, let's, what can we do about that, right?

358
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:14,940
Where if we say, just hate, sometimes it, like with the crime by far, I want to say, kind of gets lost in sort of the ether, where it's like, oh, we're against hate, but to someone who's an immigrant, they might not be able to interpret that as something that is xenophobia specifically, or something that is specifically sexism or racism or transphobia.

359
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:22,940
So I think there's some value in sort of going out there, and then targeting specific groups to be like, hey, what can we do for you, and what can we not do in both?

360
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,940
I think that is something, kind of what you're talking about.

361
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:44,940
Absolutely, yeah. I think that's the approach we take, is if we want to organize the most, the people who are the fascists are going to come for it, we should go there to those people, and the people have to deal with it, because they, you know, they feel like shit every day, so they know what's happening.

362
00:41:44,940 --> 00:42:13,940
Okay. I think Ken has a lot to say about being upfront about the politics, and mine is that I'm either in common with left, and or just whatever you want to describe it as, and in that moment, that he definitely came across a lot of an issue that I think that we'll run into, if we're trying to touch populist progressions in the chip room, where the things like racism, to some extent sexism, things like this, there's been a lot of progress.

363
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:34,940
There's been a lot of progress on the populist section, but the people who are most vulnerable to movements like Ken's, like transphobia and ableism, those are issues that still run to the core of a lot of common people who identify as progressive, but haven't been forced to address that.

364
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:52,940
So I believe, like as you were saying, that we should just say, and I hate, but then on individual talking, you have to really address and empower those groups, because they are the ones that Ken will attack, and so forth.

365
00:42:52,940 --> 00:43:20,940
But, again, definitely managed to be representative, and more of that discussion about how people who will be walking by and focused on things like, hey, like what you guys are doing, those are the people who might act accidentally, or might just act still intrinsically to themselves if they haven't questioned yet, notions of transphobia, ableism, and so on.

366
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:35,940
Yeah, and honestly, I think that should be one of the talking points, but I know a lot of people who don't think that racism is here, because they don't experience racism in the world.

367
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,940
People who say, oh, I'm so progressive.

368
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:13,940
It's taken some of my friends being with me in a room and seeing something happen before they were like, wow, does that happen all the time?

369
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:20,940
It's just a little thing, but it's just one of those little things that happens all the time, and things get worse.

370
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:26,940
When I first moved to Peterborough, I literally had people help me go back to Africa, go back to Jamaica.

371
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,940
Now I have people helping me go back to India, go back to Pakistan, go back to Iran.

372
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,940
They don't even know what I am. They're just like, you're some kind of brown, whatever, get it?

373
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,940
I'm like, I've lived in Peterborough for 20 years.

374
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,940
I've got people who moved here last year being like, you don't belong here.

375
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,940
I'm like, how can you go in here?

376
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:54,940
Again, she's seen a lot of it herself, and she's had to literally wait until I left the room to then talk to other people.

377
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,940
These people are just acquaintances. I mean, don't freak you guys.

378
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:03,940
This is not just a one-to-one situation. This is a serious thing. Stop.

379
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:09,940
You know, I've had to explain a lot to these people because they didn't understand that I was racist at this.

380
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,940
Yes, and let me explain why.

381
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,940
Let me explain that I don't think you were racist, but I understand that you have views that you just didn't know any better.

382
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:17,940
Let me explain better.

383
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,940
I understand that, wow, I didn't mean to, but it's been a while, you know.

384
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:27,940
But it's still dependent, and I've noticed that the bottom of the connection is that we don't need to get out and rally,

385
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:29,940
because whatever, the rally was only two people, it wasn't even a big deal.

386
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,940
Just because there was, you know, a rally, it wasn't even a fever.

387
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,940
It was racist fever, it was fun, it was not fever at 12 o'clock.

388
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,940
Yeah, but you don't, basically. You're not willing to stand up against it.

389
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,940
How much do you think the rest of the city is?

390
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,940
Like, if you don't think it's that big a deal, then it's definitely not a big deal.

391
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,940
But the fact is, it's definitely a big deal.

392
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:56,940
So, you know, if you're not standing up against it, you're basically telling them that, you know,

393
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,940
that you're not standing up against them.

394
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,940
What they're saying is, you might not be doing the rally with them, but you think, you know,

395
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:04,940
these guys know what you're talking about.

396
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,940
And every time there's a rally in a Jewish city, anywhere else in the world,

397
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,940
the same response is going to happen.

398
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,940
Anytime they get told, you know, oh, whatever, the police are going to protect them,

399
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,940
they have to write a free speech, hate speech, whatever, it doesn't matter.

400
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:22,940
Every time, two days later, it shows up on your website, so, you know, frankly, websites.

401
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,940
See, this place, you know, supports us, yadda yadda yadda.

402
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:30,940
Even last year, where Kevin actually literally got shared with them,

403
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:39,940
there was still them talking about, yeah, talking about like, oh, you know, I had a really good response,

404
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:46,940
and how well received he was, kind of like.

405
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,940
So that's, yeah.

406
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,940
Yeah, I mean, that's a scary thing.

407
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,940
I mean, I've been in Peterborough for like just over a year now,

408
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:57,940
and I haven't even heard of that guy, to be honest.

409
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,940
Up until, like, I saw that poster, I saw it work.

410
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,940
Has somebody been, I haven't seen any posters yet.

411
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,940
Is he living around town a lot?

412
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:15,940
No, I saw the ad for tonight, but I've never even heard Kevin before.

413
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,940
I saw that ad, to be honest with you, and I've been in Peterborough for over a year.

414
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,940
Where did you see the ad?

415
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,940
On the outside, or where did it go?

416
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:26,940
No, it was at this meeting, sorry.

417
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,940
Yeah, he hasn't put up any posters.

418
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,940
I've seen any of these.

419
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:35,940
Sorry?

420
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:37,940
Yeah, yeah.

421
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:49,940
So, like Stu was saying, he now probably just gets something figured out for the 30th kind of thing.

422
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:57,940
So, in terms of what can they agree on, the things that everyone's seen, or what I'm hearing everyone's on the page with,

423
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:07,940
is that we need to create some kind of propaganda to, I've heard the term inoculate news, basically give a counter message,

424
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:17,940
and then the other portion of it has to be we need to stop him from getting any press kind of thing.

425
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,940
We need to make it so that if you look in on the street, you're not going to say,

426
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,940
oh, there's a bunch of neo-Nazis rallying, you're going to say, huh, not really sure what's going on in there,

427
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:28,940
but I'm not seeing any neo-Nazis probably marching back and forth.

428
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:33,940
So, that seems to me to be the two kind of things that need to happen.

429
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:43,940
The other thing we should plan for is it has happened in the past in other cities where they'll call the rally,

430
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:52,940
and then they don't show up because they're worried about too much of a counter-demonstration showing up.

431
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:58,940
I mean, that's a great victory for us if it does happen, but we should also have a plan for if that does happen,

432
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,940
so we don't all get there and go, oh, okay, well, what are we going to do now kind of thing.

433
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,940
Like the same thing.

434
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:08,940
Still tell people.

435
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:16,940
You might have been hearing these things on the news or on the internet. Don't listen.

436
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:26,940
So, what do we want to do in terms of the actual logistics of that day?

437
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,940
What time are we going to show up?

438
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,940
Yeah, time and place and all that stuff.

439
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,940
I mean, ideally, we'd want to probably meet up before this group gets there.

440
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,940
So, we'd be happy to have around 1.30, 1.45-ish.

441
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:50,940
I think it would be a unique place to meet at the, just around the corner of City Hall and the block.

442
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,940
It's called the Federation Park.

443
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:58,940
I'm thinking maybe we want to meet at the other park, both behind the government buildings.

444
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,940
That one, maybe we'll meet there. I think it's right there.

445
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:06,940
Okay, try that part.

446
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:18,940
Now, just so you guys know, in terms of community relations, we're also organizing a cultural protest with the community organizations.

447
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:23,940
So, just so you know, he definitely has a block for the Federation Park.

448
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:27,940
And he's booked it from 11, 4.30.

449
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:29,940
That's important to the city.

450
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:35,940
So, whether or not he's going to be there that fast the whole time, depends on the date of the time.

451
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:43,940
I saw a post on, like, right with the website that said 2.05.

452
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,940
They booked it only from, like, when I just came through that.

453
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:58,940
So, if he's at 4.30, if he doesn't have to be there from 11, he can go to 4.30.

454
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:07,940
He could have had that time, too, as, like, a buffer where he can call and say, somebody's on this region, or this area that I have booked, go escort them all.

455
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,940
And then come to another one.

456
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:16,940
It might be good if you have somebody there from 11 till 4, and we just hang out in the park, and then it'd be like a single man kind of thing.

457
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:18,940
I'd be scared of that.

458
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:20,940
Yeah, yeah, essentially.

459
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:23,940
I think that's maybe the only way we can...

460
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,940
That was an area, so it's actually funny.

461
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:43,940
Does anybody have a background in graphic design or anything like that, though, for making the posters, banners, etc., that we want to put around town, as well as the templates that we might be able to include?

462
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:45,940
I can take that off.

463
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,940
With the content of the pamphlet, I imagine that folks have some things to say.

464
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:56,940
So, maybe if folks wanted to message what they wanted to say to the computer or the page, I can plug it into the pamphlets.

465
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,940
It might actually be a better idea if we wanted to get together for another meeting.

466
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:05,940
Just the people, maybe, that want to work on the pamphlet, specifically.

467
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,940
That way we're at the same room, it's a little bit easier to coordinate and edit.

468
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,940
That'd be good though.

469
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,940
So, you definitely will see the posters made online.

470
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:26,940
So, just so you know, we've been working on press meetings for the last two or three days.

471
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:38,940
And our press meeting is going to be done by tomorrow, on Friday, to have people sign.

472
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:41,940
So, I'm sure that we'll get a copy of it.

473
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:47,940
And we're definitely also doing a banner.

474
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:54,940
That would have messaging, anyone's friends who love this here.

475
00:52:55,940 --> 00:53:04,940
And we'll also make sure we know that this door is open.

476
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:16,940
So, what are you guys talking about?

477
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:23,940
Just like what you're saying, we're going to have someone there watching you.

478
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:24,940
There we go.

479
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,940
Because if you don't know, you may not show up, like he said.

480
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,940
And, or, you may not show up.

481
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:37,940
So, we're going to have someone there for you, you know, before you vanish the whole time, then before 30.

482
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,940
And, we're going to be across the street.

483
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:46,940
We booked that thing through our United Church.

484
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,940
So, we're going to be, we're going to have three people there.

485
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:53,940
If there are banners, we're going to have like, we're going to be as loud as possible.

486
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,940
We're going to have music, we're going to just have the whole program speeches.

487
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:06,940
And then we will have a banner that will go through on the sidewalk.

488
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:12,940
A large, very, it's simple to say, love this here, end white supremacy.

489
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:15,940
And it's going to be very large.

490
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:19,940
So, per the day of the, so on the 30th?

491
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,940
Yes, yeah, the day of, and also to the next day.

492
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:28,940
We booked Confederation Park.

493
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:36,940
And the reason I know that he booked it from 11.30 to 4.30, because I went to the city to find out what time.

494
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,940
And they said, they said we didn't have anything.

495
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:47,940
So, then I went back the same day, and because he said, okay, we'll book this space so that they can get it.

496
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,940
I went back the same day to a different person.

497
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,940
And she said, oh, they booked it from last week.

498
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,940
And I said, oh, well, they just booked me this morning, it wasn't booked.

499
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:03,940
And she said, oh, I don't know why she didn't tell you that, because it's clearly written right here that they have that space.

500
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,940
Does it just say specifically who booked it?

501
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:12,940
And it has some anti-immigration, anti-crucial approach.

502
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:14,940
That's what she asked.

503
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:16,940
That's what we titled it.

504
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:18,940
But that's not true.

505
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:24,940
And also, I think we know that this is not the only line.

506
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:26,940
That there's a few.

507
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,940
Yeah, so Storm Alliance called it originally, and there's a letter going on across the country.

508
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:33,940
Yeah.

509
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:40,940
So, Storm Alliance is a lot better organized than Kevin, and a lot more dangerous, just because they're organized.

510
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:42,940
But yes, yeah.

511
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,940
There was originally one happening in Toronto on Hamilton, both of those were canceled.

512
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,940
But Niagara, Peterborough, and Ottawa are still going on.

513
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,940
And I'm worried that folks are having a little trouble reading the book.

514
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:54,940
Yeah.

515
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:58,940
Okay.

516
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:00,940
Go ahead.

517
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:17,940
So, from your own personal networks, do you have an impression that there's more than just what's here tonight that is interested to go and be present, counteract the racist rally?

518
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:29,940
I'm confident that, like both organization and personally, there's probably another 15, 20 people that I know that should be out there.

519
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:35,940
I'm also expecting at least 5 to 10 more members.

520
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:39,940
I said I'm here for them more.

521
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:41,940
Yeah.

522
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:43,940
How about yourself?

523
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:45,940
I'm not sure.

524
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:47,940
I'm not hearing back from people.

525
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:52,940
So, I'm not hearing people talking about it, but I don't hear.

526
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:54,940
People talking about it.

527
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:56,940
Yeah, yeah.

528
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,940
People are looking at time for themselves.

529
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:06,940
Maybe now that there's a definite time, maybe we'll need something we don't care about.

530
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,940
Yeah.

531
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:16,940
Yeah, I guess that impacts what kind of strategy you normally use.

532
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:18,940
Yeah.

533
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:37,940
It's definitely like, you don't want to lose the confrontation with them because it's bad for your health, but also for propaganda purposes, it's not good to get.

534
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:39,940
An organization would do it.

535
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,940
Yeah, it's not good to get by the Nazis.

536
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:49,940
The Nazis are the police that in turn are going to ask to be on the area and they won't have a place to play.

537
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:51,940
Yeah.

538
00:57:53,940 --> 00:58:01,940
So, with that in mind, is it possible that there's a necessity to just let people know that this is happening ahead of time?

539
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:11,940
In which case, should we be handling down counts like, hey, there's a rally happening at this time, one week from now, five days from now.

540
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:17,940
If you don't agree with this, you should be out there to help drown them out and shut them down.

541
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:19,940
In other words.

542
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,940
Yeah, well, yeah, also let people know what's happening.

543
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:35,940
So, just as far as timeline is concerned, so it's going to be on Friday we're going to have this, the press release is quite intense, but whatever.

544
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:42,940
We're going to be sending it out to different organizations, have signatures, we'll send it out to your group, as many people as possible.

545
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:57,940
So, Monday it gets top like PR, so we're asking that one year we're going to be saying yes, we're going to have a rally, our rally.

546
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,940
So, that's our timeline.

547
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:05,940
And then on Wednesday we're going to have a press conference.

548
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:09,940
And we'll let as many people come up to that as well.

549
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:17,940
Because the press has been asking us and we've been amongst the word until we're straight in our minds all the more.

550
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:23,940
So, Friday is a press release, Monday is a release too.

551
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:28,940
Wednesday is a press conference next week.

552
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:35,940
And Saturday is going to be a auction and somebody is going to let down their hair braid.

553
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:52,940
Well, we should decide as an organization whether we want to follow the same timeline or not.

554
00:59:53,940 --> 01:00:04,940
I think there's a certain juxtaposition in terms of both strategy and kind of a larger view on how fascism needs to be combated going on.

555
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:14,940
And for that reason I think, I'm not sure, although we're working on the same cause, we're completely locked in step on everything.

556
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:21,940
But it's the group's decision and I'm just a single member of the group.

557
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:31,940
I would suggest the most effective way to get the biggest number of people out, to drown Kevin out, is as soon as possible.

558
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:36,940
Let people know about it, start pamphletting, start letting people know.

559
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:52,940
We need to figure out where the best spots to hand out the pamphlets are and definitely get them out, definitely get them out.

560
01:00:53,940 --> 01:01:03,940
And then the only thing I can really think of on the day of handing out pamphlets, we do have to watch out to be individual at it.

561
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,940
Because then, these guys are really violent, right?

562
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,940
You go out there individually, right?

563
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,940
Do you want to make sure?

564
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:19,940
What kind of numbers are expected for Saturday?

565
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:31,940
Well, we have different groups. We have Quick, we have Peace Council of Europe, we have the Peace Name Centre, we have Food Not Long.

566
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:36,940
We have faith groups there as well.

567
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:41,940
We're hoping that we get down to people.

568
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:47,940
We already have Teddy, we have these bookings, but it's private as well.

569
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:54,940
And private, even we invited only two hundred and a half of them said yes, they're going to come. That's only at two hundred.

570
01:01:55,940 --> 01:02:01,940
The last one I did, last month, we had three hundred and that was just two degrees.

571
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:09,940
So, we're hoping to get a good response for sure. Yeah, definitely.

572
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:13,940
And that's for the Saturday one as well as the Sunday one?

573
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,940
We're aiming more for the Saturday.

574
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:26,940
Because we want to know that, for example, people coming, like our immigrant people, especially people of colour,

575
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:37,940
if they're there protesting, you know, down with black people and no one's doing anything, then people are not going to feel safe.

576
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:44,940
So, we want to say that, you know, these are the minority and hopefully with all this happening, maybe they will show up.

577
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:51,940
But I suspect that they're going to. That's my gut feeling.

578
01:02:54,940 --> 01:03:00,940
Are there indicators that people from other parts of Ontario will come here or Ottawa?

579
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:05,940
Ottawa has something going on. Niagara has something going on.

580
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:07,940
Windsor has something going on.

581
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:11,940
London, I think there might be something going on.

582
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:16,940
But Toronto, there's nothing going on. Hamilton has nothing going on. They're the two really big centres.

583
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,940
And there's like, there's the JNO in Toronto. There's soldiers going to Toronto. There's Storm Alliance.

584
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:26,940
There's a bunch of our groups, so there is a possibility that those folks will show up.

585
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:30,940
Plus, just Kevin's own connections from Boy Power.

586
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:33,940
Yeah, and from my perspective.

587
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:48,940
So, basically, even if you don't follow the exact timeline and, well, hand-putting or just, you know, putting up posters, even if it just was saying, hey, like, come out and protest against fascism on this day.

588
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:55,940
Like, it doesn't necessarily have to be the timeline. We don't have to say the guy's name or what the protest is or where he is. We don't want to advertise for him.

589
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:03,940
But telling people, like, if you were going to take Peterborough, if you, you know, you don't want this kind of thing in Peterborough, then come out on this day, you know, around this time.

590
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:08,940
Like, it doesn't necessarily have to be for, say, like, for this rally, for that one, just to show up.

591
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:11,940
And your venue is across the road.

592
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:30,940
So we could even, even if we choose to do a different timeline, perhaps say to them that is the venue of the counter-protest, just for the sake of legitimacy kind of thing and also not promoting where his rally is going to be.

593
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:37,940
So that thing that this is where the counter-protest is, this is where they will want to be to do the direct action.

594
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:46,940
The only concern I would have is it sounds like there's two very different strategies. Like, if one strategy is to confront him more, the other strategy is not to.

595
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:59,940
You don't want people confused on which one they're shown up to. If someone thinks they're shown up to a peace rally against a way kind of thing, that's very different than if someone's shown up to a rally that is, you know, going to...

596
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:02,940
A peace rally versus a counter-protest.

597
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:07,940
They're different things, and you don't want people showing up for one, think they're showing up for the other, like that's just...

598
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:15,940
But even raising awareness in the first place, like a random person on the street probably doesn't know there's going to be a rally.

599
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:30,940
Oh yeah, I'm not suggesting that. I just think it might be, it could actually confuse and muddle things. If you say, hey, show up here, and then people are like, well, I showed up for this, or people show up and, okay, these people are going, oh, I'm going to follow them, oh, no, that's not where I want to be, I want to be over here, kind of thing.

600
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,940
So are we going to...

601
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:47,940
So we could give the information that multiple groups are planning to, you know, account for this with, you know, an anti-hate rally, or, you know, a peace rally here, or a counter-protest there, to say that there are various groups coming together.

602
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:52,940
You know, you don't want to say this one group without one group, but this group's doing this, this group's doing that.

603
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:58,940
But at least it gets people looking up information on their own, and they can find that online, or check out each individual group.

604
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:08,940
So where are we going to put on our posters? Are we saying that our venue is Confederate Square, and saying, come to bear where we'll be counter-protesting, or are we going to stay in that venue?

605
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:15,940
I would say across the street, so you're not, you're not people showing up and, like, showing up on the precious doorstep.

606
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:23,940
Like, you know, you don't want people showing up and being at risk until you've got enough numbers that everyone is safe that shows up.

607
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:28,940
Henry, we, I assume, aren't going to get a permit for that or anything?

608
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:30,940
We're not going to get a permit for this animal.

609
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:33,940
So, across the street is going to be better.

610
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:50,940
Just on your point, yeah, we definitely are not, haven't named that person, so we are not giving, like you said, any PPR, and definitely, if you say confirmation from on your posters, the city, because we, when we were planning our rally,

611
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:52,940
Be very careful.

612
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:58,940
The city calls me because you don't have a permit, and so we had to get a permit.

613
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:07,940
We had, like, four rallies, and that was the first time the city, because you said the legal team called and said, do you know they're going to have this rally?

614
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:09,940
So we had to get a permit.

615
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:14,940
So if you put configuration permit, you're going to have a city call you and say, where's your permit?

616
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:17,940
But you could definitely be on the sidewalk.

617
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,940
That's, you don't need a permit for those things.

618
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:23,940
It's very hard to promote organizing just outside of that.

619
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:25,940
We don't want the president to be able to.

620
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:27,940
On the sidewalk, yeah.

621
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:29,940
I wouldn't be worried about it at all.

622
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:31,940
I think we'll, I think we'll, yeah, there'll be no problem.

623
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:33,940
All right.

624
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:35,940
So this is a.

625
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:37,940
This is a.

626
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:39,940
There's a rally.

627
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:41,940
This is a decision here that has to be made.

628
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:44,940
We should actually make a dead democratic decision on that topic.

629
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:59,940
So I guess the question is, where do we want to gather for a more confrontational rally, or do we want to do that?

630
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:01,940
And I guess just going around the table.

631
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:11,940
First, do we want to hold something that is more confrontational, that is separate for various reasons from more of a peace vigil approach to this?

632
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:13,940
I would vote in favor.

633
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:15,940
Stu?

634
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:17,940
For me, it's like somewhat conditional.

635
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:20,940
I guess like it's situational.

636
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:22,940
So.

637
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:27,940
Because it's definitely about like numbers and stuff like that.

638
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:38,940
So I'm kind of like, yeah, I defer to, I don't know if I have enough information at this point.

639
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:42,940
I support it theoretically.

640
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:51,940
If we have lots of numbers that we're interested in doing that, then I support that.

641
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:53,940
Appreciate it.

642
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:58,940
Well, to address that point, I guess, how do we deal with that question?

643
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:04,940
It seems to be we're going to need to just plant the flag, or we're not for sure not going to have the numbers kind of thing.

644
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:06,940
Right.

645
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:14,940
Should it be the case that we call it, and if we have the numbers, we go and confront.

646
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:17,940
If we don't have the numbers, we don't.

647
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:19,940
Right.

648
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:28,940
Yeah, I guess I would kind of maybe wait and see what other people feel about it, I guess, as well.

649
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:32,940
Yeah, so I would be in favor of that.

650
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:38,940
I guess maybe just to give some reason, because it does happen quite as well, just to talk about stuff.

651
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:48,940
When we think about, you know, having a peace rally, having a computational rally, I think that by the nature of sort of peace rallies,

652
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:55,940
I think that there's like a duality of tactics we can use, where like, yeah, people can be given computational, people can take the vaccine, do different things, right?

653
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:57,940
We can walk and chew gum.

654
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:06,940
At the same time, though, I almost see what's happening here is almost by having these two separate rallies, we're actually sort of doing a huge, tremendous disservice,

655
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:13,940
and tremendous service to the fascists by not confronting them.

656
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:22,940
Not only are we giving them space to be politically active, we are giving them space to propagandize, we're giving them space to consolidate, and we're giving them space to organize.

657
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:28,940
So, just to give a little bit, a really quick little historical bit here, in 1930s Germany, Nazis are on the rise.

658
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:35,940
There are several organizations, like the Waitrose Federation, as well as groups like the Roger Frankfurt Fund.

659
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:42,940
One organization chose the peaceful route. When the Nazis began to consolidate power, they were executed and thrown in jail.

660
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:53,940
The militant folks who combated the Nazis, they did that, and they were also, because of the disservice of a lot of the peaceful folks who were there, they were also killed and executed.

661
01:10:54,940 --> 01:11:02,940
When we think about fascism, and how it rises, and when we look at it as an historical example, as we should, because history is a thing we should study and learn from,

662
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:11,940
we see that every single time that fascism is rode, whether it be in Italy, Spain, Germany, anywhere you go, where fascism is giving state power.

663
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:17,940
It has been because there have been large groups of people who have purposefully separated themselves from being congregational.

664
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:25,940
And, as much as I don't want to be the bearer of values, peace isn't going to do much. It's really not.

665
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:32,940
These folks are arming up. They are in bed with the palace angels. They have plans to kill and murder people.

666
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:39,940
They are not just simply having this rally to hang out with each other. They're having this rally to recruit, so they can get more people armed up and ready to kill people.

667
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:46,940
It is up to us, as organizers, and people who genuinely care about the union fascism, to be militant and to be combated.

668
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:55,940
And if we don't do either of those two things, fascism will rise, because that's what it's done in every single country, where people decided that peace would be a better opportunity than combativeness.

669
01:11:56,940 --> 01:12:04,940
And what I'm seeing here is sort of very tragic, because I'm seeing a very, like, a repeat of history, where it's like, folks, we've made these mistakes so many times.

670
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:10,940
Let's not make it again. Let's get together. Let's shut them down. Don't give them the space to organize. Let's organize on the day.

671
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:23,940
Let's say Kevin Goodrich. Let's say they're Nazis. Let's say this is what they're doing. Let's tell people what they're doing, because they're telling people what they're doing, and we should be able to reveal the reality of the situation to people.

672
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:39,940
And so I would say that I think I'm very strongly in favor of a constitutional rally, because I would feel absolutely terrible if I was a part of the White Rose organization in Germany that advocated peace, or if I was a part of some organization in Spain, it would be that promoted peace and gave rise to fascism.

673
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,940
So, pretty strongly in favor.

674
01:12:42,940 --> 01:13:11,940
As well, with my political ideology background and everything, I'm very skeptical of the police network, especially in Peterborough, of all places, and I expect that we are going to be seen and kind of structured in the response to everything as an unable force, regardless of if we do a peaceful thing or anything else.

675
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:19,940
In terms of confrontation, I think if they have high numbers, there is a risk of confrontation from them, especially with both venues, extremely close.

676
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:40,940
With that in mind, and with the skepticism about the police stepping in to be protecting the force, I am in favor of us having a separate thing where, when we say direct action, it isn't intrinsically a punch in the face, but it will possibly consider non-legal action,

677
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:43,940
like rallying with the permit and everything.

678
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:56,940
If we have the numbers marched through the streets, as we did at DACA last year, which got the masses' attention, versus if it was just a meeting in Confederate Square, then it would be activists learning about what is happening.

679
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:06,940
I think we need to be very upfront about it. I think that organizing is a violent act in itself, because they are organizing to commit violence.

680
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:26,940
In that sense, I think that we should, I agree that we need to have a separate group, or at least perhaps if it is open, an informal faction of the other group, where we will be separating off to the street.

681
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:35,940
Yeah, for sure. Also, when we are at Confederate Square and they are here, we need to be the buffer for short, 100%.

682
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:46,940
So, we are definitely here to stop the spread of this white supremacy in different ways.

683
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:59,940
Definitely, you have to be fresh in the sense that they have to know that what they are doing is totally not something that we want here in the city.

684
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:22,940
The problem with, if there is a larger group, the problem is that if we don't stop saying that we don't want them here, then people from other places can see Peterborough as things that you can just come in and be white supremacists and then leave there.

685
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:41,940
So, we definitely don't want that. But what we do want to see is something like what happened in Vancouver, where there were so many people who came together and protested the streets that it kind of drowned out the white supremacists to say that they are not welcome there.

686
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:59,940
Now, having said that, my concern is that if you are, like you said, you are going to be hunting in the face of being violent and or shouting really dehumanizing statements, you are just being like them.

687
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:07,940
And when you become, when you need to dehumanize somebody, it's easy to go places that you don't want to be.

688
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:12,940
If you are, you know, using outright, you know, a lot of techniques.

689
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:20,940
And that sometimes, or at times, if it's very militant, it can come across as being like the police and too aggressive.

690
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:31,940
And we as people of color, we want to be protected, but we don't need that aggressive type of behavior, i.e. like a militant who is protecting us.

691
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:51,940
But I feel it's important that, yes, if we are, you know, wanting to talk that there is some sort of protection, and from people, protecting people of color, to protect people of color,

692
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:59,940
to protect people of color, to protect people of color, to protect people of color, to protect people of color, to protect people of color, no matter what they say.

693
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:13,940
So, you know, and that way, definitely, but, to outright try to antagonize them, so that they're, you know, they're in their face and shouting really horrible things to them,

694
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:17,380
that I can't see will be a good thing

695
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:19,380
because to the outside world,

696
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:20,980
it will just be hate to hate.

697
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:25,100
And we don't want to hate to hate

698
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,100
because they'll just say you're just as bad

699
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,860
as those with disappearances.

700
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:31,300
So that's a problem,

701
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:34,920
but they definitely need to be comprending

702
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,580
the sense of control.

703
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:41,820
I think that's all right.

704
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:46,140
I'm definitely in favor.

705
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:49,100
I don't think we should be screaming obscenities

706
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:52,260
or yelling things or dehumanizing them,

707
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:53,740
but I think it's important

708
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:55,460
that we should be standing there telling them

709
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:57,380
that we don't accept white supremacy,

710
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:00,100
that we are not going to accept these types of behaviors

711
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:01,780
and that these aren't the kind of people

712
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:03,900
or the kinds of ideologies that we want here

713
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:05,320
and that they're not okay.

714
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:08,460
The hate speech is not a phrase of the future.

715
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:11,060
And that killing people for how they're born

716
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,420
or their faith or their nationality,

717
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:15,860
any of that is just absolute bullshit.

718
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:20,340
And I think it's important that we make that clear

719
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:24,040
within making ourselves look like a bunch of bullies.

720
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,340
That's not the intent,

721
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:27,540
but we can still have a confrontational,

722
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:30,100
no, you're lying, you're not telling the facts.

723
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:34,060
Immigrants are good for our economy.

724
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:35,860
They do all these things for us.

725
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:39,400
People of color are all throughout our history.

726
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,100
They've been here longer than many of the white people

727
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:43,460
have ever heard.

728
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:46,480
And enough is enough.

729
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:50,900
I'm definitely in favor of a confrontational

730
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:53,980
about looking to go into fights or call names,

731
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:57,020
but I do think we need to call them out on their ideology.

732
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:58,460
And if I can add onto that,

733
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:01,140
I think that's what having two groups of people

734
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:02,820
does really well in terms of having people

735
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:04,500
that are fighting people know what's happening

736
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,700
as you're going by,

737
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,700
because you are really controlling the message

738
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,220
because you do get that spin where it's like,

739
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:11,620
oh, someone's confronting Nazis, they're bad people.

740
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:13,980
And you can say, no, okay, here's where we disagree.

741
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:15,620
Here's where we disagree with them.

742
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:17,360
This is what we're doing.

743
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:20,020
This is what we think society needs to be like,

744
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:21,660
and we'd really like it if you could get on board.

745
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,540
And if the kind of things you're putting forward,

746
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:27,420
you know, anti-racism, anti-fascism, anti-Islamophobia,

747
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:32,420
anti-Semitism, those are things

748
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:35,220
that everyone can get on board with.

749
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:37,940
And if you do a good job of communicating that message,

750
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,860
I think you can walk in true gum.

751
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:42,540
You can make sure that the fascists aren't speaking out

752
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:44,340
and you can make sure that they're not getting energy,

753
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:45,900
they're not getting strength,

754
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:49,580
and you can quite frankly make them uncomfortable,

755
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:52,180
make them not feel welcome

756
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:56,400
while also not coming off as thugs,

757
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,620
not coming off as the bad guys.

758
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:06,220
Yeah, in terms of definitively capital-testing

759
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:10,220
and failing, I feel like it's extremely important

760
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:12,620
to also have a large valley of people who are just saying,

761
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:15,060
we are just here for peace, we are just here against hate,

762
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:18,180
we are just here to love, we are just here to come together

763
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:21,100
because it is important for people to be able to see that,

764
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:24,380
but there also does need to be a certain group of people

765
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:25,780
that are standing up saying,

766
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:28,580
we are not going to sit down and let us be attacked.

767
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:30,740
We're not gonna sit down and let our Eastern friends

768
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:33,980
and our families and our brothers and sisters and neighbors

769
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:36,940
be attacked because you can be at a peaceful rally

770
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:39,180
doing absolutely nothing wrong, not throwing anything,

771
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:40,740
not doing anything, not yelling anything,

772
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:42,260
that's not gonna mean they're not gonna

773
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:44,340
still ride a van into you.

774
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,500
You could just be minding your own business

775
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,980
but they will still attack you,

776
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:50,740
and when they do it, the other Nazis are gonna go,

777
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:53,060
that guy wasn't one of us, no.

778
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:54,700
It was who told you not a Nazi attack

779
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:57,620
and just a random attack that has happened to me

780
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:59,180
at a anti-Nazi rally by a guy

781
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:01,500
who may or may not have been one of us, I don't know,

782
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:04,540
but the fact is that they are disparate groups.

783
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:08,380
The thing that they have to tell them is that they all hate.

784
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:09,820
They don't all agree on the same things.

785
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:11,100
They don't all agree on their politics.

786
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:12,420
They don't all agree on who they hate

787
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:14,900
or how they hate them or why they hate them.

788
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:17,220
They all just hate and they're angry

789
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:20,940
and they wanna lash out at something.

790
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:22,740
So they're just lashing out, who are their things,

791
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:23,860
easiest who are their things,

792
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:26,340
eat whoever is gonna take it,

793
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:30,220
and if people aren't standing up,

794
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:31,700
then they're gonna think that they can

795
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,340
continue to get away with things.

796
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:34,980
They can continue hurting people

797
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:38,140
and they just get to retreat back into their own.

798
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:39,100
Did I say I was a Nazi?

799
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:40,460
I just said I was a Nazi, yeah.

800
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:42,060
Nobody's upcoming to their homes

801
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,140
and sprinting into their houses.

802
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:46,580
Nobody's throwing birds through their windows

803
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:48,140
and threatening their families.

804
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:52,220
I don't have to go rallying for that to happen to me.

805
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:54,660
I could just be walking down the street.

806
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:55,500
They know.

807
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:56,900
We've been attacked in bars.

808
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:59,380
We've had to be able to do the racism on the street here

809
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:01,020
on a regular basis.

810
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:04,860
I was recently attacked in my home by my roommate's sister

811
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:06,500
who was actually from out of town

812
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,980
and not only did the police refuse to press charges

813
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:10,460
because it was my work against terrorism,

814
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:12,100
but then they turned around and asked her

815
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:13,460
if I was from out of town.

816
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:17,380
It was the only person they asked where they were from

817
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:18,820
was her, yeah.

818
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:22,060
Both the roommate and her sister were both recovered.

819
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:24,620
I've been a leader for over 20 years, over 20 years,

820
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:28,660
but that's still what's happening to me.

821
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:29,660
I called the cops.

822
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:30,820
I said, I've been attacked.

823
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,300
They got their little bow.

824
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:34,940
Did you, though?

825
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:36,300
I think they could even write the name

826
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,220
of the woman who attacked her on the police report.

827
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:45,340
And that's just a day-to-day kind of thing for you to grow.

828
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:48,620
People just aren't safe here.

829
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:50,860
Dan?

830
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,660
I'm in favor of the confrontation.

831
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:57,100
Really, I'd love to know what that is about.

832
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:59,380
We do have to be safe.

833
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:05,820
We can obviously assess the situation that day

834
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:12,540
and if the numbers are on ourselves,

835
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:17,540
not to say attack, but just to,

836
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:21,540
I mean, I think we'll totally tell each other

837
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:26,540
that we know what the boundaries are

838
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:28,020
and the limits are.

839
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:34,220
But I would definitely sign it forward

840
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:39,220
and we'll direct and properly protest.

841
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:49,700
Being smart about it, not the term,

842
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:54,260
all of us, but I was thinking that we,

843
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,900
for the last couple of months,

844
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:05,100
it's a really, it's just a really fucked up time right now.

845
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:11,580
We have to, we have to have good strategy

846
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:19,060
to not get bumped into people in the U.S.

847
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:24,060
People in the U.S., also, propagated.

848
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:31,100
So, you know, I guess I'd rather go for a confrontation.

849
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:36,100
Sorry, to clarify that, I do mean on the other,

850
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:38,180
fully non-aggressive, like counter-contrasting,

851
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:41,060
like counter-message, being on the sidewalks

852
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:43,900
in front of a bar, but not going into the crowd.

853
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:46,140
We don't need to be two inches from our face.

854
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:47,660
Exactly, we need to yell at them.

855
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:49,740
We need to talk to the people walking by.

856
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:51,380
We don't need to yell at them.

857
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:53,740
I'm not sure if I think that I've been met that.

858
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:58,740
I just meant, you know, if there's enough people

859
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:00,820
and everyone is feeling safe,

860
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:03,780
that maybe we can get closer

861
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:07,260
and not try to instigate violence by any means,

862
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:11,060
but I think that there's more of a direct message

863
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:16,060
that you can visibly see, you know,

864
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:20,540
more people, like in Vancouver,

865
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:24,340
like in Boston, a few weeks ago, too, or whatever.

866
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:30,700
Yeah, I don't necessarily think,

867
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:32,980
I don't necessarily think across the street,

868
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:34,580
if across the street's what we can do,

869
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:35,860
then across the street's what we can do,

870
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:38,220
but if the score is what we can do,

871
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:40,740
then the score is what we can do, so.

872
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:43,540
And I think, again, it's something we'll have to assess.

873
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:44,380
Chris?

874
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:45,700
I think the problem we're gonna have

875
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:49,660
with actually doing a cabinet protest

876
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:51,660
is the commuter counting.

877
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:56,100
There are a whole pedagogy of hate,

878
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:59,580
so if you're gonna get started talking, I'm talking to them.

879
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:01,540
It's just you become shouting much,

880
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:03,380
which means both parties are just starting

881
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:04,860
to talk to each other.

882
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:07,260
I mean, if you want to take an example,

883
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:10,540
you can pass this to revolutionary or one of those Jesus

884
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:14,140
John Lennon, Donny, they were all killed

885
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:15,500
because they were pacifists, right?

886
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,980
So make sure they're not being preached love and hate,

887
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:20,100
but they also didn't really truly stand up

888
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:21,820
for a lot of things, right?

889
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:24,420
So they do need to have that type of stance

890
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:26,220
where you're gonna say, well, there's certain things

891
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:27,540
I'm not gonna stand up for.

892
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:33,340
But with, I mean, knowledge and power,

893
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:35,580
so we don't have to treat it to an idea

894
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,260
that needs to have a better idea.

895
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:40,300
So if you're trying to confront hate,

896
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:41,780
you need to speak about love

897
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:44,220
and actually speak on the behalf of them.

898
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:47,500
Why fascism is a negative idea,

899
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:50,980
why separating people is a negative concept,

900
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:53,220
and they all are inclusive, right?

901
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:57,740
So I just think if you are willing to do a counter protest

902
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:01,140
and counter this guy in particular,

903
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:03,220
with a degree of certainty,

904
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:05,060
you just need a negative idea.

905
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:07,420
With a degree of certainty, it's just gonna get negative.

906
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:08,580
It's just gonna get a negative match

907
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:11,420
and you're just gonna make yourself look bad.

908
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:14,340
So if you're going to counter productive

909
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:16,540
or counter the protest,

910
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:18,620
you've gotta attack the people who have good means

911
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:21,860
most to them, that's the people walking by,

912
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:24,220
which is basically getting them this information.

913
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:25,980
Sure, this guy's in here preaching hate,

914
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:28,020
but let me give you the alternative.

915
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:30,740
Why fascism is bad, why hating people

916
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:32,780
for different races and different colors is for great,

917
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:34,700
why it's bad, because then you're just gonna make him

918
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:38,460
look like a fool, and then that guy will go to the protest

919
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:40,220
by actually showing people that the guy's

920
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:41,860
a complete fucking moron,

921
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:43,660
and here's how we're gonna do it.

922
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:46,580
I think that's the final take on it.

923
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:51,180
I would say that it's pretty scary

924
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:54,380
that the city would let violent racists

925
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:56,580
organize something like that.

926
01:27:56,580 --> 01:28:01,580
It's like we don't wanna be the ones

927
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:04,020
to instigate the violence, obviously,

928
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:08,700
but we obviously can't let them sell the message, right?

929
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:12,740
So we do need to find a way to divert the traffic.

930
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:17,740
The only thing about that is if they violently,

931
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:21,500
what do we do to stop that, right?

932
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:25,540
Make sure to keep it collective, right?

933
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:27,380
Yeah.

934
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:32,500
Jordan, can I have a comment?

935
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,500
I feel like a lot of the discussion we've been having

936
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:37,420
are getting into this notion of what being confrontational

937
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:40,620
actually means as far as practical implications,

938
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:43,060
and it's the kind of thing that I think we're all happy

939
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:45,100
with by understanding the fact that we don't want

940
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:48,620
to go start punching these people in the face is unwarranted.

941
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:51,620
You don't want to be the people that begin to get

942
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:53,340
that violence, but you also have to be prepared

943
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:55,060
for the fact these people are going to be violent

944
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:56,580
towards you.

945
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:58,460
You have to be prepared to defend yourselves,

946
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:02,660
and this confrontation and militancy,

947
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:06,300
that word that this kind of organization you want to have,

948
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:10,820
it's not a notion of going and trying

949
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:12,420
to instigate with these people.

950
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:14,500
We're not trying to get these people certified.

951
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:16,460
What we want is that we want to make sure

952
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:18,380
that they don't get the message out there,

953
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:20,700
and we want to make sure that they're denied

954
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:22,300
any sort of gains that they could get

955
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,440
from organizing like this.

956
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:29,680
So there needs to be a discussion at some point

957
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,120
about what confrontation militancy actually means

958
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,680
as far as practical discussions,

959
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:38,280
but I think we all kind of have a understanding here

960
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,680
where it's not going out to these people,

961
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:43,200
screaming slurs in their face and trying to start a fight.

962
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:46,560
It's defending our gains and making sure

963
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:51,480
that we can operate safely and help educate other people.

964
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:54,560
But it's also knowing you're having it too, right?

965
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,640
And because they preach hate,

966
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:59,720
they're going to use hate as an intimidation factor

967
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,520
to get their message across as a whole.

968
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,080
That's the whole premise of it.

969
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:04,600
If you avoid that altogether,

970
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:07,800
and just instantly use their hate against them,

971
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,680
they're more than equal,

972
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:10,800
rather than actually going out

973
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,400
and actually confronting them.

974
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,600
Because they're trying to spread their message,

975
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:16,960
so that's their idea,

976
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,600
so that you simply just say, that's their idea,

977
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,880
here's the flip side of that idea,

978
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:23,200
that's a better idea,

979
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,080
which makes them look like a fool.

980
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:26,880
You also have to be prepared for the fact that

981
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,640
I'm not saying to be prepared,

982
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:29,640
I'm just saying, well,

983
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:32,840
if you start to have engaging them

984
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,040
in that kind of conversation,

985
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,720
with a certain degree of certainty,

986
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,080
it's going to get better.

987
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:42,880
Oh, yes, sorry.

988
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:47,520
So I'm also okay with confrontation.

989
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:49,920
I don't think we necessarily,

990
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,760
yeah, I don't know, I'm on for confrontation.

991
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:57,920
I think that these people should feel that they

992
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,040
cannot organize here successfully.

993
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:04,520
If they leave that rally feeling like it was a success,

994
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:05,720
I think we failed.

995
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:10,560
And I think that we need to make them leave that day,

996
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:14,520
feeling like if they want to do that again,

997
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:15,960
it will be a struggle.

998
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:20,360
And I think confrontation is the way to be met.

999
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:22,720
I think if we don't come up with it,

1000
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:24,880
it will leave that day,

1001
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,440
having had people come up to them,

1002
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:29,760
having had people feel comfortable coming up to them,

1003
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,880
having felt like they got their message out there,

1004
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:36,040
regardless of,

1005
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,400
yeah, regardless of anything else,

1006
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,920
I think if they are not confronted,

1007
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,800
they will leave feeling empowered.

1008
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,560
And that is the last thing you want in your community,

1009
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,800
is a bunch of Nazis feeling empowered.

1010
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,600
And I think confrontation is the way to make them feel

1011
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:53,960
like they do not have power,

1012
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:55,560
because they do not have power.

1013
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:00,120
But ignoring them or allowing them to spread their message

1014
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:03,240
will lead them to believe that they do.

1015
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,080
Can I just say something that I'm going to leave?

1016
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:08,560
Yeah.

1017
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:12,200
Just so that we're also going to have

1018
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:17,200
a group of people taking pictures,

1019
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:21,320
because we do want to have these pictures,

1020
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:22,920
and we're going to be posting the pictures

1021
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:26,120
of these single Nazis all over the internet,

1022
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:27,360
according to them.

1023
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:30,640
And the police, if they say anything like,

1024
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,200
kill the Jews or kill the black,

1025
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:35,080
I think that's considered a hate crime,

1026
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:38,600
and they could be charged.

1027
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,480
So we will definitely have cameras and stuff

1028
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:43,680
but I got them.

1029
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:46,640
But thanks for organizing with us.

1030
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:49,480
And we'll definitely see you guys on Saturday.

1031
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:50,320
Yeah, sure.

1032
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:51,480
Okay, take care.

1033
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:52,320
Thank you.

1034
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,160
See you.

1035
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:54,000
Bye.

1036
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:01,080
Well, okay, so I think effectively there,

1037
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:03,920
everyone on the table said they do, to some degree,

1038
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:07,920
want to do something separate from across the road,

1039
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:12,920
lock off the Nazis from the public kind of thing.

1040
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,240
My understanding going around the table

1041
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:18,760
is everyone is on board with at least having

1042
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,520
something on the sidewalk that makes it

1043
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:22,000
so that the Nazis are not busy

1044
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,400
when you drive down George Street and look right.

1045
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:30,880
Past that, I think there are different points going on.

1046
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,600
I'm not sure if we actually have enough

1047
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:37,240
logistical information in order to make a call

1048
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:40,720
on what we do past that because like a couple of you

1049
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:42,520
both said, if it's the 10 of us,

1050
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,520
that's very different than if 40 people show up,

1051
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:46,480
very different than 100 people show up.

1052
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:52,640
But the question is still, are people comfortable

1053
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:56,320
with the idea that we would lock off the Nazis?

1054
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,600
And to answer your point, I think you're right

1055
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,440
that if you get into the shouting match back and forth

1056
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:03,080
with them, you make an asset both of yourselves.

1057
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:05,160
And in any action I've ever done,

1058
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:08,080
the strategy has never been to like start yelling back

1059
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:10,480
before the Nazis because they know some pretty foul things

1060
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,920
and can just yell at you, but you can show it over them.

1061
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:16,560
You can just be like, just chant, don't respond.

1062
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,160
Like no matter what they do,

1063
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:19,360
they can say whatever they want,

1064
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,240
just Stonewall them kind of thing.

1065
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:25,080
And then just chant, chant, chant,

1066
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,600
so that they can show themselves

1067
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:29,360
of course all kinds of profanities and terrible things.

1068
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:32,400
And no one can know what they're saying.

1069
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:35,880
And the important part is that we're educating people

1070
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:37,480
because the best way to crush fascists

1071
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:39,680
is to organize their place of undermoon.

1072
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:42,800
So this is sort of all just a rut,

1073
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,200
like we're yelling them to shut the rally down

1074
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:45,280
so they can't propagandize,

1075
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,960
but our real work getting done is community organizing

1076
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:49,760
is getting the community together.

1077
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:53,800
I feel like a lot of people would also

1078
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:55,640
feel unsupportiveness in the ocean

1079
01:34:55,640 --> 01:35:00,480
in terms of fighting hate, ignorance, disinformation.

1080
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,040
Like the idea that we're gambling,

1081
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:04,440
that we're spreading real information

1082
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:08,160
is it's not just saying Nazis are bad, fascism is bad.

1083
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:11,080
But that we're not just coming out to say,

1084
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:12,480
screw these guys, we're gonna be like,

1085
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:15,400
listen, the problem they're talking about are real problems,

1086
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:17,480
but this is not how we fight these problems.

1087
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:19,240
I mean, I'm just saying that we're not trying

1088
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:21,400
to just trust them, that we're fighting ignorance,

1089
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:24,640
that we're fighting hate, that we're spreading information

1090
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:27,080
to better people's lives.

1091
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:32,080
So we catch it as a positive counter protest, basically.

1092
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:40,840
Yeah, so do we want to call a rally

1093
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:46,560
or across the street publicly and advertise for that,

1094
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:50,760
not committing ourselves to anything more than that,

1095
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:53,960
quite frankly committing ourselves to anything publicly

1096
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:56,560
that could be illegal is always a bad idea.

1097
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:02,080
But with the knowledge that the plan is to block

1098
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:11,080
the Nazis off and if possible, shut them down

1099
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:13,240
in terms of basically make it so the public

1100
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,160
can't get access to them and they cannot get access

1101
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:16,000
to the public.

1102
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,320
Although, yeah, okay, go ahead.

1103
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,600
My concern is that we can't have protection

1104
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:23,840
in those terms, but that's what we want to do,

1105
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,440
is have protection in those terms.

1106
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,680
As we presented, we're trying to shut down

1107
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:30,280
their ability to spread information

1108
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:32,480
and if we're trying to halt free speech,

1109
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:33,760
then once again, we're putting ourselves

1110
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:36,200
in a position to be bad guys.

1111
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:38,200
Right, that's one way.

1112
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,560
I mean, I don't know if that's one way or the other.

1113
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,200
Just because I've heard that a few times

1114
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:43,880
that I haven't been ruining it.

1115
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:46,600
Yeah, we were talking about we don't want to push hate.

1116
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:48,560
The rest of us, we don't want to put in that.

1117
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:51,160
But just like, it's how we state the message,

1118
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:52,920
not just what we're trying to do.

1119
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:54,720
Yeah, and I think the thing is that we have

1120
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:55,920
to do shit in their mind.

1121
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,960
Is that when we talk about tactics

1122
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:00,560
and what we do physically in the real world,

1123
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,040
like what we're doing, I think these things

1124
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:06,160
have a political character that aren't dependent

1125
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:08,240
on what the actual tactic is, right?

1126
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:09,080
Because we can talk all day about,

1127
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:11,720
is it fascist to do this?

1128
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:14,760
And the reality is that fascists have a direct set

1129
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:16,040
of political goals and political aims

1130
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,520
that we don't have, right?

1131
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:18,720
When we talk about fascists and we say,

1132
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:22,760
hey, what do you think about shutting us down?

1133
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,200
They would agree with shutting us down,

1134
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:28,160
but they would also agree with genocide and FSI

1135
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:31,360
and mass deportation, whereas we don't, right?

1136
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:33,240
When we envision a totally different world

1137
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:35,120
than they envisioned, our political goals

1138
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:37,400
and our aims are totally different from theirs

1139
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:41,240
just because we happen to also agree with shutting them down

1140
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:42,680
I don't think it draws a world

1141
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:44,400
that we don't see between the two of us.

1142
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:45,720
They have a definite set of aims,

1143
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:47,800
we have a definite set of aims.

1144
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:50,080
They're going to push for theirs and we can push for ours,

1145
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:54,760
but the reality is that if we don't adopt these tactics,

1146
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:56,840
they're going to lose them because they're going to do it.

1147
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:59,120
They're not worried about drawing moral equivalency.

1148
01:37:59,120 --> 01:37:59,960
They're just going to do it.

1149
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:00,800
They're just going to kill people.

1150
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,520
They're just going to take state power.

1151
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:05,560
We should probably meet them where they're at.

1152
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:07,880
Okay, so what about the adoption of the tactics?

1153
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:09,880
Does the adoption be a message,

1154
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:11,680
like the whole point is that they're able

1155
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:12,680
to get away with being Nazis

1156
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:14,360
because they're saying, I'm not a Nazi.

1157
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:15,600
They're allowed to get away with this

1158
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,160
and go get a raise in the American Union

1159
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:18,320
because they're saying, I'm not doing that

1160
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,040
even as they're doing it.

1161
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:22,320
We live in a world where people say

1162
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,000
that Black Lives Matter is a terrorist group

1163
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,120
because they're arguing that black people

1164
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:30,080
shouldn't be getting shot all the time.

1165
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:33,120
We live in a world where people can swallow any message.

1166
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:35,920
Like I've had friends, those friends,

1167
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,040
who I know have not been racist,

1168
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,360
who have said, well, all lives matter.

1169
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:42,160
And I'm like, yeah, buddy, that's the point.

1170
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:43,920
Black lives matter, all lives matter.

1171
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,640
All lives matter, including black lives.

1172
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:47,320
There's nothing wrong with Black Lives Matter

1173
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:48,600
if all lives matter.

1174
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:50,160
I didn't hear you saying anything

1175
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:52,440
about all lives mattering with this guy who's killed

1176
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:55,000
until somebody said Black Lives Matter.

1177
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,520
But that same thing is that people

1178
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:59,000
who they're just overhearing

1179
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,640
is the message, the headline.

1180
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:03,440
They're gonna read a headline saying,

1181
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:06,120
anti-fascists try to shut down a rally

1182
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:09,880
instead of having the protesters spreading information.

1183
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:12,840
I guess if we present ourselves as the enemy,

1184
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:15,840
then they use that same argument themselves.

1185
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,160
And when they're recruiting,

1186
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,760
that's what they use to paint us as the enemy.

1187
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:22,120
To say that when we're the real terrorists here,

1188
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:23,320
we're the ones who would actually

1189
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:24,880
try to shut down free speech.

1190
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:28,520
So if we just say we're just getting more information,

1191
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:30,280
we're getting additional information from them

1192
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:34,080
to shut them down, even if that's actually what we are.

1193
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:35,640
Mr. Stewart, you wanna,

1194
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:38,360
yeah, like, kind of like, jumping off the thing

1195
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:43,040
that you said about the political cover that we're,

1196
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:47,920
maybe think about how it's not just our politics,

1197
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:51,520
sort of fascist politics that creates

1198
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:55,800
what people can perceive it as,

1199
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,760
but it's like there's political interests

1200
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:02,200
that are shaping how that information's being put out,

1201
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:03,240
like the narrative of it,

1202
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:08,240
like maybe fascists being just bad or whatever.

1203
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:11,840
That's also, like, there's a political interest

1204
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:17,280
in delegitimizing any actor that's not a police officer,

1205
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:22,280
more like a mayor, more like courts and that kind of thing.

1206
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:24,520
These are the only places where this fight should happen,

1207
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:28,680
according to the state and media and stuff.

1208
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:32,920
And so, and otherwise,

1209
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:36,680
just people having grounds for any kind of perspective,

1210
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:38,520
it's like,

1211
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:43,160
within that political context,

1212
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:45,320
it's acceptable to a degree,

1213
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:47,360
as long as it doesn't turn into

1214
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:52,200
them actualizing their thing directly.

1215
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:54,840
If they put it through the state,

1216
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:59,840
if he puts genocidal policies into,

1217
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:03,400
or immigration policies into power,

1218
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:05,080
then that's still fine,

1219
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:06,600
because it's just using the machinery

1220
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,680
that's already there,

1221
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:12,520
and it's not like seeing that it's a problem,

1222
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:15,160
but when you have people in the community there

1223
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:17,320
trying to directly stop something,

1224
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:20,920
it's really easy to present it as,

1225
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:24,800
and also not saying that we should,

1226
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:29,280
like, I think I agree that we should mitigate how,

1227
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:32,240
do try to mitigate perception stuff.

1228
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,160
Do try to mitigate perception stuff.

1229
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:38,120
Do try to mitigate perception stuff.

1230
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:41,080
Do try to mitigate perception stuff.

1231
