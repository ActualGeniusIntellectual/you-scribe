0	5700	What is a Fascist?
5700	9740	In my last video titled What is a Fascist?, I discussed what a fascist isn't.
9740	12280	Notice those quotation marks in the title, lol got em.
12280	16780	The point of that video was to go over the long list of things that are clearly not fascism.
16780	21480	As in, they cannot be found in the works of classical fascist political theory by Benito
21480	26980	Mussolini, Giovanni Gentile, Alfredo Rocco, and yet these things are routinely and incorrectly
26980	32140	called fascist by terminally online brainlets who don't know anything about politics beyond
32140	34300	what their favorite talking head tells them to think.
34300	37500	To these people, fascist has come to mean almost anything.
37500	38840	Anything on the right, certainly.
38840	42480	Anything remotely capitalistic, including liberalism, as dumb as that is considering
42480	44480	actual fascist economic thought.
44480	48900	Anything that has even a whiff of the non-material, as Marxist historical materialism demands
48900	53540	that only material conditions are factors in historic events, and that ideology is always
53540	55260	secondary, which is clearly stupid.
55260	58740	And yes, anything that's funny, because the issues of our time are so serious that
58740	62300	there cannot be any levity, because levity means taking a break from being an always
62300	66300	on, always political agent, and as we know, everything is political.
66300	70740	Now that sounds like crazy talk, surely even the most extreme of leftist activists have
70740	71740	downtime.
71740	75020	And yes, they do, but to the extent that they do is the extent to which they are hypocritical,
75020	77540	because this is the natural end result of their politics.
77540	78820	Let me show you how.
78820	82120	This tweet went viral last week, and it's the centerpiece of what I'm talking about.
82120	84900	Conspiracy theories are everywhere, and people don't understand how harmful they are.
85060	86060	Check out this chart.
86060	89340	At the bottom we've got grounded in reality, and the first section is labeled things that
89340	90340	actually happened.
90340	93700	And yeah, these are real events that were covered up and then later revealed to be true.
93700	97340	Nobody's going to argue that Nixon had his slammy paws in Watergate, or that the FBI
97340	100780	spied on MLK, or that the government experimented on black Americans in Tuskegee.
100780	102580	This is all stuff that we have proof for.
102580	106820	Right above that is the speculation line, and the next section is labeled we have questions.
106820	111120	Here we've got unsolved mysteries, or at least stories with some unknown components,
111120	114920	like Epstein didn't kill himself, the Iran-Contra affair, and UFOs.
114920	118920	The next section is above the leaving reality line, with the implication that the creator
118920	121980	of this graph believes everything above this mark to be untrue.
121980	125760	This section is titled unequivocally false but mostly harmless, and contains some really
125760	129800	goofy stuff, like how Prince Charles is a vampire, Ted Cruz is a zodiac killer, and
129800	130960	Elvis lives.
130960	135360	Next up, past the reality denial line, is dangerous to yourself and others, and this
135360	137360	is where some things start to get weird.
137600	141760	Okay, Antifa did January 6th is obvious nonsense, and people who actually believe that are just
141760	142760	huffing copium.
142760	147040	Additionally, I highly doubt that vaccines contain microchips, but as far as I can tell,
147040	149820	it's really only extreme crazies who actually believe it.
149820	151880	Most people say it as a joke, it's a meme.
151880	154720	It's fun to larp as somebody who's crazy, especially online.
154720	156760	Same thing with the moon landing being fake.
156760	160400	Same with jet fuel doesn't melt steel beams, that's literally a 4chan meme.
160400	164960	Same with soy boys, that's just a funny observation showing a mostly coincidental connection between
164960	167320	soy consumption and effeminate men on the left.
167320	169060	And what the fuck, Biden's a robot?
169060	170060	Who has ever said that?
170060	173160	If he was a robot, you'd think they put something faster than a Pentium 2 in his brain.
173160	175300	And a lot of these are justâ€¦ odd.
175300	179280	The US presidential election was stolen is way up here, presumably referring to 2020,
179280	183440	but if this chart were made in 2016, I guarantee you this person would put that right at the
183440	188080	bottom, because randy lefty twitter accounts absolutely spent years screaming about morussian
188080	189080	interference.
189080	191000	And feral people in forests?
191000	192480	That's actually true.
192480	196400	Talk to anybody who's gone camping or hiking or trailblazing, it's reasonably common
196400	200960	to walk off into the bush and encounter random homeless junkies who are just out there losing
200960	201960	their fucking minds.
201960	206200	Right at the top, past the antisemitic point of no return, no idea why it's suddenly
206200	211040	antisemitic specifically, is the hilariously named section World Ruled by Supreme Shadow
211040	214520	Elite Promotes Hatred and Violence Towards Marginalized Groups.
214520	216600	Alright, let's see what's in here.
216600	220960	Illuminati, Holocaust denial, deep state, QAnon, great replacement, new world order,
220960	224760	secret satanic rituals, reptilian overlords, this is literally just a list of memes for
224760	228400	most people, there are obviously real QAnon types out there, there are obviously real
228400	232680	holocaust deniers, but a lot of this shit is actually said in jest.
232680	237380	Most people who say this stuff are just having a laugh, Shirley ContraPoints isn't up here
237380	241480	because she used the reptilian overlords meme in her capitalist video, right?
241480	244140	Some of this stuff is clearly just jokes, like nazis on the moon.
244140	248080	The extreme absurdification of nazism has been a cultural trope for 50 years now, starting
248080	253040	with the legendary naziploitation movie Ilse, She Wolf of the SS, from 1974, where a smoking
253040	258080	hot german woman ran a concentration camp and performed sexual experiments on the hot
258080	260680	american prisoners of war that were brought under her control.
260680	265140	It's a ridiculous, hilarious movie known for shock and schlock, but it was still wildly
265140	267360	popular because of how over the top it was.
267360	271420	It turns out that people like to see depraved fucked up shit, and they often find humor
271420	272680	in its absurdity.
272680	276920	Directly downstream from this absurdist view of nazism are things like the nazi vampires
276920	281160	from hellsing, the mecha hitler from wolfenstein, the cryogenically frozen hitler clones in
281160	295560	argentina and a variety of shitty movies, nazi obsession with ancient relics and artifacts
295560	300280	with occult power like in the marvel movies or indiana jones, nazi werewolves, nazi ufos,
300280	302200	and yes, nazi moon bases.
302200	306400	You are not describing a real conspiracy theory here, you're describing a cultural trend of
306400	310120	mocking nazis to the point of rendering them absurd, treating them like the jokes that
310120	311120	they are.
311120	314880	And, just like last time, you get a few things that actually have a ring of truth to them.
314880	318360	The specific pizza shop surrounding pizzagate probably had nothing going on, but do you
318360	321640	actually doubt that those among the rich elite of the world with an interest in children
321640	323680	wouldn't be able to obtain them if they wanted?
323680	327480	While hollywood is turning your kids gay is a bit too on the nose, do you think that there's
327480	331760	not some sort of byproduct of the push to normalize alternate sexualities that might
331760	335120	come in the form of people adopting identities they're not fully comfortable with in order
335120	336120	to fit in?
336120	361280	Especially when activists sing about it?
361280	364080	Are you really going to say that cultural marxism is a conspiracy theory?
364080	368520	When academia even just 10 years ago had no problem talking about it and analyzing
368520	372700	its effects, while nowadays everybody screeches that it doesn't exist while citing sources
372700	376200	of the people who are actually involved in it saying that it doesn't exist?
376200	380000	This is some we have investigated ourselves and discovered we've done nothing wrong
380000	381000	type of shit.
381000	385020	You should notice that all of the conspiracy theories that ended up being true but benefiting
385020	388340	left wing causes are at the bottom of the chart, while all of the conspiracy theories
388340	391800	that ended up being true but benefiting right wing causes are at the top.
391800	395980	The more apolitical conspiracy theories are largely accurately placed, but when politics
395980	397940	are at play there is a clear bias.
397940	402160	And the really crazy leftist conspiracy theories, the ones that absolutely do belong at the
402160	406840	very top of the chart as well, like how America or the CIA or whatever has caused every single
406840	410340	instance of socialism to fail, or that dark money is flooding in and preventing shitty
410340	413280	progressive candidates from getting elected, all of that stuff is noticeably missing.
413280	414900	It's not on the top, it's not on the bottom.
414900	418640	It clearly belongs on the top and if this person put it on the chart at all, she would
418640	422500	have to put it on the bottom as per her biases, and that would be a glaring red flag, so I
422500	424920	think she just left them off and hoped no one would notice.
424920	428640	But the truth is, most people do not believe most of this stuff.
428640	432460	Most people could understand that a lot of conspiracy theories are just fun schlock,
432460	434580	fables that people tell each other to have a good time.
434580	438860	This chart, in practice, acts as a list of these stories, with the approved ones at the
438860	440680	bottom and the banned ones at the top.
440680	444420	The ones at the top have been placed there because they delegitimize, depoliticize and
444420	447600	make light of progressive and socialist causes and goals.
447600	450940	In my previous video, I showed a bunch of articles and takes, and it's time to go over
450940	453240	a few of those in a bit more depth.
453240	454240	Consider this.
454240	456020	Astrology is a gateway to fascism.
456020	460900	All such mysticism that seeks to explain human behavior as inborn and predetermined rather
460900	463460	than as a result of material conditions is like this.
463460	465460	It is not misogyny to point this out.
465460	467420	Why would somebody believe this to be true?
467420	469020	I mean, okay, she says it in the tweet.
469020	473180	She says all such mysticism that seeks to explain human behavior as inborn and predetermined
473180	475600	rather than as a result of material conditions is fascist.
475600	477640	That is the Marxist view taken to its extreme again.
477640	483460	But why does she think that a rejection of Marxist historical materialist view is fascist?
483460	487880	Historical materialism seeks to scientifically understand history, and I say that with the
487880	492300	biggest air quotes I can muster, by stripping history of its ideological framework and looking
492300	494800	only at the material conditions of the event.
494800	499380	In other words, all historical wars must be wars of resources, not wars of ethnicity,
499380	501880	nationality, religion or political persuasion.
501880	506320	Any belief counter to this must conclude that material conditions is not the only variable
506320	509760	and that there must be other causes determining human behavior, whether that's an appeal
509760	512760	to genetics or faith in an ideology or anything else.
512760	514700	It must be fascist.
514700	518900	And so because astrology is an analysis of the world that rejects materialism, it must
518900	520540	be a gateway to fascism.
520540	523860	And no, this isn't just some dumb fuck Twitter user saying this out of nowhere.
523860	528700	In Theodore Adorno's The Stars Down to Earth, he writes, the tendency to occultism is a
528700	530880	symptom of the regression in consciousness.
530880	534780	This has lost the power to think the unconditional and to endure the conditional.
534780	539060	Instead of defining both in their unity and difference by conceptual labor, it mixes them
539060	540100	indiscriminately.
540100	543300	The unconditional becomes fact, the conditional an immediate essence.
543300	547780	By its regression to magic under late capitalism, thought is assimilated to late capitalist
547780	548780	forms.
548780	552500	The hypnotic power exerted by things occult resembles totalitarian terror and present
552500	554020	day processes the two are merged.
554020	557960	The power of occultism, as of fascism, to which it is connected by thought patterns
557960	562340	of the ilk of antisemitism is not only pathic, rather, it lies in the fact that in the lesser
562340	567120	panaceas, as in superimposed pictures, consciousness famished for truth imagines it is grasping
567120	571740	a dimly present knowledge, diligently denied to it by official progress in all its forms.
571740	576380	It is the knowledge that society by virtually excluding the possibility of spontaneous change
576380	578500	is gravitating towards total catastrophe.
578500	581020	In other words, fascism is capitalism decay.
581020	585180	The occult is part of fascist thought through both of their gravitation towards irrationalism
585180	589520	and the rejection of materialism and embracing the spiritual is a mental pathway to fascism.
589520	592640	Again, none of this is a part of fascist political theory.
592640	597340	The embracing of the occult, as well as irrationalism as a way of thinking, is one of the major
597340	601400	differences between Italy's classical fascism and Germany's national socialism.
601400	605280	And by the way, when I said that by the strictest definition of classical fascist theory, the
605280	609320	only true fascist states were Italy and Spain, I was correct.
609320	614080	In pre-Nazi Germany, individuals who would later become major players in the Nazi government,
614080	619020	notably excluding Hitler himself, were part of the Society of Thule, an occult organization
619020	621820	that ran from 1918 to 1925.
621820	626180	The views of this secret society would later provide the ideas of blood-purity and the
626180	630540	Nordic racial mysticism to Nazi political theory, and became the source of the mystic
630540	635280	elements of Nazism as seen in the previously mentioned pop culture references.
635280	639500	After World War II, a strand of thought came about called Esoteric Hitlerism, where New
639500	643540	Age religious movements adopted the more mystical aspects of Nazi ideology.
643560	647980	This is where the Black Sun symbol comes from, that you might see in both memes and legitimately
647980	652440	far-right stuff, as part of this belief system is in the mythical land called Hyperborea,
652440	656940	the ancient home of the original Aryans, a race of blonde-haired, blue-eyed, noble-blooded
656940	661760	giants, that Hitler's use of the swastika marked him as the 9th avatar of Vishnu, and
661760	664060	he ascended as a deity after his death.
664060	667700	And listen, there's way more to this than that, and it's all absolutely nonsense.
667700	671960	But this isn't a video on Esoteric Hitlerism, maybe we'll do one another time, but it's
671960	672960	really fucking dumb.
673060	676440	All you need to know for the purposes of this video is that it's all occult mumbo jumbo
676440	680520	that doesn't actually map onto anything in reality, and its adherents are part conspiracy
680520	683400	theory believer, and part spiritual nutcase.
683400	688180	And it's this specific strain of thought that uneducated leftists use to link up conspiracy
688180	692420	theories, the human capacity for spiritual experiences, and Nazism, and by extension
692420	696660	fascism, since they believe that Nazis and fascists are the same thing in all respects.
696660	700200	Even though fascist's spiritual component is explicitly worship of the state, and not
700200	702300	any of this racial mystic garbage.
702740	707760	Oh, and also, a lot of this comes from Julius Evola's writing, so when people call Evola
707760	712100	worshippers fascists, they're incorrect, but when they call them Nazis, that's actually
712100	713960	got a lot more weight to it.
713960	719000	They may not be economic Nazis, they may not be statist Nazis, but they are certainly spiritual
719000	720000	Nazis.
720000	724180	And this point is just for me personally, I recently played a terrible FMV game on stream
724180	728600	called Black Dahlia made back in the 90s, about an Aryan wizard who was given a final
728600	733480	set of orders by Hitler to use a magic crystal once wielded by Germanic crusaders, the Black
733480	735860	Dahlia, to take over the world and conquer America.
735860	741000	The game is steeped in Nordic runes and old Germanic families and all that occult stuff,
741000	744520	and it actually knew the difference between fascism and Nazism.
758600	786120	Man, that feel
786120	790740	when this garbage knows more political theory than people who claim to be politically engaged
790740	791740	nowadays.
791740	792920	Okay, that's enough dev ranting.
792920	798280	At this point, you should now understand how the left conceptually links fascism, Nazism,
798280	800200	spirituality, and conspiracy theory.
800200	803800	However factually inaccurate that may be, you now get their logic.
803800	808160	Okay, now you know why they view conservatives as fascists, because conservatives tend to
808160	810260	be more religious and more spiritual.
810260	815060	Now you know why they consider religious belief, or patriotism, or close ties with family or
815060	819860	culture or ethnicity, to be gateways to fascism, because these are beliefs with non-material
819860	820980	components.
820980	825300	That dreaded spirituality in religion, devotion to the bourgeois construction of the nation,
825300	829580	the homeland, in patriotism, and preference for the specific over the universal, valuing
829580	834840	metaphysical bonds with other particular individuals rather than treating people as atomized, faceless,
834840	835840	and replaceable.
835840	842220	If a thing has a non-material component, and love, relationships, friendships, honor, patriotism,
842220	847820	nostalgia, and spirituality all have non-material components, it's either fascist or fascist
847820	851120	adjacent, at least in the eyes of the most extreme of the left.
851120	856260	And so this view renders almost everybody and everything fascist.
856260	858760	Which is why they're calling everybody and everything fascist.
858760	860580	There's one final piece of the puzzle.
860580	863140	I went over these articles in other videos, we don't need to revisit them in too much
863140	864140	depth.
864140	865140	But I'll just remind you of them.
865140	868260	Trump and the Nazis, our troll in chief, has a deep affinity with the alt-right, and with
868260	869600	their ancestors.
869600	873260	After the outrage in Charlottesville, Donald Trump emerges as the leading alt-right troll,
873260	874860	a Hitler of lulz.
874860	878880	This article tries to link Trump to Nazism through online trolling, as if trolling itself
878880	881380	were a core component of Nazism.
881380	882380	Racists are recruiting.
882380	883380	Watch your white sons.
883380	887360	Parents need to understand how white supremacists prey on teen boys so they can intervene.
887360	891720	This is an opinion piece about a mother who almost crashed her car because her sons laughed
891720	896300	at a meme on their phone that used the word triggered, and how Nazis were recruiting feeble
896300	898400	young minds using memes.
898400	901660	From NPR, memes are the final boss level of appropriation.
901660	903060	What the hell does this all mean?
903060	907060	It turns out that most people who talk about conspiracy theories don't actually believe
907060	908520	in conspiracy theories.
908520	909520	Consider Armoured Skeptic.
909520	913400	He's largely abandoned politics videos and he now makes conspiracy theory content, talking
913400	917240	about bigfoot and UFOs and ancient aliens and the pyramids and whatever else.
917240	918360	It's all good fun.
918360	919480	It's nonsense.
919480	920780	Nobody actually believes it.
920780	924760	But telling tall tales for the entertainment of an audience, embellishing stories, creating
924760	928920	these new mythologies to influence people, it's all, technically speaking, lying to
928920	930720	people for fun.
930720	932000	Bigfoot doesn't actually exist.
932000	936300	But when you take on the role of a storyteller around a campfire, telling a very real story
936300	940040	about Bigfoot, I saw him with my own eyes you guys, you're doing multiple different
940040	941040	things.
941040	942040	1.
942040	943040	You're lying for entertainment.
943040	944040	2.
944040	945040	You're evoking an emotional response in your audience.
945040	947720	You're stirring their souls a little bit, if you're a particularly good storyteller.
947720	951400	You're grasping at the metaphysical aspect of them, because there's clearly no material
951400	952400	Bigfoot.
952400	953400	3.
953400	956480	There's a new technology, a new belief system that is fundamentally inaccurate about the
956480	957480	world.
957480	960220	And no, it doesn't matter if people don't actually believe it, because it's still
960220	962880	got a place in that conspiracy theory chart in the end.
962880	968320	In indulging the non-material, the irrational, even just for fun, to these people you are
968320	970220	creating a space for fascism.
970220	973520	Does this make armored skeptic a fascist by their ridiculous definition?
973520	975300	Well, yes.
975300	979000	It makes everybody but their purest members a fascist.
979000	982720	So when 4chan makes jokes about chemtrails or jet fuel not melting steel beams, even
982720	987060	though it's comedy, it's also technically not true, making it a conspiracy theory, making
987060	991940	it an irrational belief, making it a component of the irrationalist wing of Nazism through
991940	994980	esoteric Hitlerism, making it fascist.
994980	995980	You got all that?
995980	999980	I'm not saying this is the exact, direct thought process of every single dyed hair
999980	1004520	hipster latte-sipping journo who write such articles as how to stop your child from being
1004520	1008280	an online internet troll, they're not actually smart enough to know all this shit, but the
1008280	1011880	underlying philosophy that guides them, the people who influenced them back when they
1011880	1016040	were at university, this is the ideological framework that they're operating from within.
1016040	1019600	All trolls and pranks are therefore, to them, fascist.
1019600	1025260	Edgy YouTubers and streamers, the prank-centric, shock-humor, gross-out content of the 90s,
1025260	1029040	it's all just latent fascism, and nobody knew it until the professors told them.
1029040	1033340	Pepe must be a fascist, the okay hand symbol's fascist, milk drinking is fascist, places
1033340	1037440	that still find trolling funny, 4chan and Newgrounds, they're all fascist enablers,
1037440	1042360	nobody user a nazi, and so every time somebody pulls a prank, it's gotta be them darn far
1042360	1045660	right neo-nazis again, it can't just be kids having fun.
1045660	1050000	The point of my last video was to describe at least some of the infinitely long list
1050000	1052560	of things that the left views as fascist.
1052560	1056900	The point of this video is to describe to you why they view it as fascist.
1056900	1058220	I'll leave you with a prediction.
1058220	1062460	The ways in which the left embraces spirituality nowadays, if the progressives are still wielding
1062460	1066680	hegemonic cultural influence in 20 years, will be considered highly problematic by that
1066680	1067680	time.
1067680	1070280	We've already seen the beginnings of this, because also on that conspiracy chart was
1070280	1074020	Essential Oils Cures Everything, and that was considered a leftist position up until
1074020	1075080	very recently.
1075080	1079300	The Essential Oils thing was only believed in by the hippy-dippy, anti-vaxx, all-organic,
1079300	1080540	peace-and-love style progressives.
1080540	1084160	You've got stoners and trippers, almost always more left-leaning than right, who do
1084160	1088620	self-research into psychedelics and buddhism and ego-death in order to find themselves
1088620	1093260	and induce spiritual experiences and whatever else, and the non-material realizations that
1093260	1098120	come from those experiences will only be more demonized by materialists over time.
1098120	1102820	You've got trans-spiritualists too, who spout nonsense like, trans people have fundamentally
1102820	1106760	different spiritual experiences than cis people, and religious ecstasy has more in common with
1106760	1108160	sex than anything else.
1108160	1111800	These might actually be true statements, I don't know, but a political persuasion that
1111800	1115520	rejects the metaphysical will not tolerate this point of view indefinitely.
1115520	1119560	I've made jokes in the past about how Aboriginal activists are actually Nazis, but I wonder
1119560	1121800	if the left will eventually reach that logical conclusion.
1121800	1125820	They are heavily spiritual, and that spirituality is intrinsically tied up in their ethnicity.
1125820	1129260	Their connection to their land is based on their blood and their race, and they certainly
1129260	1130980	spend a lot of time calling for living space.
1130980	1132900	This is some blood and soil shit.
1132900	1136940	The most insidious thing of all, this linking of the spiritual, the conspiracy, and the
1136940	1141900	Nazi, is how all you have to do to be considered a Nazi now is just ask questions that aren't
1141900	1142900	approved of.
1142900	1146860	For example, if a year and a half ago, you said that you believed there would be vaccine
1146860	1151660	passports or mandatory vaccination requirements as a result of the pandemic, not only were
1151660	1155240	you told that it wasn't going to happen, but you were told that just for thinking it,
1155240	1159200	just for voicing it, you were a conspiracy theorist who was dangerous and needed to take
1159200	1163400	off the tinfoil hat and stop being a Nazi, even though those very things are actually
1163400	1164400	happening right now.
1164400	1169580	If a conspiracy theory is no longer a conspiracy theory, but has in fact become reality, are
1169580	1172600	you really a Nazi simply because you were thinking ahead of the curve?
1172600	1177280	Or is it that the left's view of Nazism is fundamentally flawed, and purposefully so,
1177280	1182580	that it may be used as a tool to silence good faith questioning and bludgeon non-compliers?
1182580	1185200	The answer to that question is pretty easy to find.
1185200	1188900	Just tell any of these people no, and see what happens.
1188900	1190580	Alright guys, that about does it for me today.
1190580	1194420	I hope you enjoyed the video, and I hope you excuse me for taking as long as I did.
1194420	1196860	Hopefully you understand why the wait was required.
1196860	1200540	I'm streaming tonight on the gaming channel, twitch.tv slash game boomers, make sure you
1200540	1203020	drop in, and I will see you there.
1203020	1204020	Have a good one.
1204020	1204180	I love you.
1207280	1207780	Bye.
