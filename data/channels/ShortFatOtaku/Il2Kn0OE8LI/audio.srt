1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
What is a Fascist?

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,740
In my last video titled What is a Fascist?, I discussed what a fascist isn't.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,280
Notice those quotation marks in the title, lol got em.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,780
The point of that video was to go over the long list of things that are clearly not fascism.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,480
As in, they cannot be found in the works of classical fascist political theory by Benito

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,980
Mussolini, Giovanni Gentile, Alfredo Rocco, and yet these things are routinely and incorrectly

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:32,140
called fascist by terminally online brainlets who don't know anything about politics beyond

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,300
what their favorite talking head tells them to think.

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,500
To these people, fascist has come to mean almost anything.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,840
Anything on the right, certainly.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,480
Anything remotely capitalistic, including liberalism, as dumb as that is considering

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,480
actual fascist economic thought.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,900
Anything that has even a whiff of the non-material, as Marxist historical materialism demands

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,540
that only material conditions are factors in historic events, and that ideology is always

15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,260
secondary, which is clearly stupid.

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,740
And yes, anything that's funny, because the issues of our time are so serious that

17
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,300
there cannot be any levity, because levity means taking a break from being an always

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,300
on, always political agent, and as we know, everything is political.

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,740
Now that sounds like crazy talk, surely even the most extreme of leftist activists have

20
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,740
downtime.

21
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,020
And yes, they do, but to the extent that they do is the extent to which they are hypocritical,

22
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,540
because this is the natural end result of their politics.

23
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,820
Let me show you how.

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,120
This tweet went viral last week, and it's the centerpiece of what I'm talking about.

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,900
Conspiracy theories are everywhere, and people don't understand how harmful they are.

26
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,060
Check out this chart.

27
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,340
At the bottom we've got grounded in reality, and the first section is labeled things that

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,340
actually happened.

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,700
And yeah, these are real events that were covered up and then later revealed to be true.

30
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,340
Nobody's going to argue that Nixon had his slammy paws in Watergate, or that the FBI

31
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,780
spied on MLK, or that the government experimented on black Americans in Tuskegee.

32
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,580
This is all stuff that we have proof for.

33
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,820
Right above that is the speculation line, and the next section is labeled we have questions.

34
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,120
Here we've got unsolved mysteries, or at least stories with some unknown components,

35
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,920
like Epstein didn't kill himself, the Iran-Contra affair, and UFOs.

36
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,920
The next section is above the leaving reality line, with the implication that the creator

37
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,980
of this graph believes everything above this mark to be untrue.

38
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,760
This section is titled unequivocally false but mostly harmless, and contains some really

39
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,800
goofy stuff, like how Prince Charles is a vampire, Ted Cruz is a zodiac killer, and

40
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,960
Elvis lives.

41
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,360
Next up, past the reality denial line, is dangerous to yourself and others, and this

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,360
is where some things start to get weird.

43
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,760
Okay, Antifa did January 6th is obvious nonsense, and people who actually believe that are just

44
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,760
huffing copium.

45
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,040
Additionally, I highly doubt that vaccines contain microchips, but as far as I can tell,

46
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,820
it's really only extreme crazies who actually believe it.

47
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,880
Most people say it as a joke, it's a meme.

48
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,720
It's fun to larp as somebody who's crazy, especially online.

49
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,760
Same thing with the moon landing being fake.

50
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,400
Same with jet fuel doesn't melt steel beams, that's literally a 4chan meme.

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,960
Same with soy boys, that's just a funny observation showing a mostly coincidental connection between

52
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,320
soy consumption and effeminate men on the left.

53
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,060
And what the fuck, Biden's a robot?

54
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,060
Who has ever said that?

55
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,160
If he was a robot, you'd think they put something faster than a Pentium 2 in his brain.

56
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,300
And a lot of these are justâ€¦ odd.

57
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,280
The US presidential election was stolen is way up here, presumably referring to 2020,

58
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,440
but if this chart were made in 2016, I guarantee you this person would put that right at the

59
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,080
bottom, because randy lefty twitter accounts absolutely spent years screaming about morussian

60
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
interference.

61
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,000
And feral people in forests?

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,480
That's actually true.

63
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,400
Talk to anybody who's gone camping or hiking or trailblazing, it's reasonably common

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,960
to walk off into the bush and encounter random homeless junkies who are just out there losing

65
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
their fucking minds.

66
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,200
Right at the top, past the antisemitic point of no return, no idea why it's suddenly

67
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,040
antisemitic specifically, is the hilariously named section World Ruled by Supreme Shadow

68
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,520
Elite Promotes Hatred and Violence Towards Marginalized Groups.

69
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,600
Alright, let's see what's in here.

70
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,960
Illuminati, Holocaust denial, deep state, QAnon, great replacement, new world order,

71
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,760
secret satanic rituals, reptilian overlords, this is literally just a list of memes for

72
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,400
most people, there are obviously real QAnon types out there, there are obviously real

73
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,680
holocaust deniers, but a lot of this shit is actually said in jest.

74
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,380
Most people who say this stuff are just having a laugh, Shirley ContraPoints isn't up here

75
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,480
because she used the reptilian overlords meme in her capitalist video, right?

76
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,140
Some of this stuff is clearly just jokes, like nazis on the moon.

77
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,080
The extreme absurdification of nazism has been a cultural trope for 50 years now, starting

78
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,040
with the legendary naziploitation movie Ilse, She Wolf of the SS, from 1974, where a smoking

79
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,080
hot german woman ran a concentration camp and performed sexual experiments on the hot

80
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,680
american prisoners of war that were brought under her control.

81
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,140
It's a ridiculous, hilarious movie known for shock and schlock, but it was still wildly

82
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,360
popular because of how over the top it was.

83
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,420
It turns out that people like to see depraved fucked up shit, and they often find humor

84
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,680
in its absurdity.

85
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,920
Directly downstream from this absurdist view of nazism are things like the nazi vampires

86
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,160
from hellsing, the mecha hitler from wolfenstein, the cryogenically frozen hitler clones in

87
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:55,560
argentina and a variety of shitty movies, nazi obsession with ancient relics and artifacts

88
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,280
with occult power like in the marvel movies or indiana jones, nazi werewolves, nazi ufos,

89
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,200
and yes, nazi moon bases.

90
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,400
You are not describing a real conspiracy theory here, you're describing a cultural trend of

91
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,120
mocking nazis to the point of rendering them absurd, treating them like the jokes that

92
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
they are.

93
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,880
And, just like last time, you get a few things that actually have a ring of truth to them.

94
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,360
The specific pizza shop surrounding pizzagate probably had nothing going on, but do you

95
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,640
actually doubt that those among the rich elite of the world with an interest in children

96
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,680
wouldn't be able to obtain them if they wanted?

97
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,480
While hollywood is turning your kids gay is a bit too on the nose, do you think that there's

98
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,760
not some sort of byproduct of the push to normalize alternate sexualities that might

99
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,120
come in the form of people adopting identities they're not fully comfortable with in order

100
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
to fit in?

101
00:05:36,120 --> 00:06:01,280
Especially when activists sing about it?

102
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,080
Are you really going to say that cultural marxism is a conspiracy theory?

103
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,520
When academia even just 10 years ago had no problem talking about it and analyzing

104
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,700
its effects, while nowadays everybody screeches that it doesn't exist while citing sources

105
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,200
of the people who are actually involved in it saying that it doesn't exist?

106
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,000
This is some we have investigated ourselves and discovered we've done nothing wrong

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
type of shit.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,020
You should notice that all of the conspiracy theories that ended up being true but benefiting

109
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,340
left wing causes are at the bottom of the chart, while all of the conspiracy theories

110
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,800
that ended up being true but benefiting right wing causes are at the top.

111
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,980
The more apolitical conspiracy theories are largely accurately placed, but when politics

112
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,940
are at play there is a clear bias.

113
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,160
And the really crazy leftist conspiracy theories, the ones that absolutely do belong at the

114
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,840
very top of the chart as well, like how America or the CIA or whatever has caused every single

115
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,340
instance of socialism to fail, or that dark money is flooding in and preventing shitty

116
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,280
progressive candidates from getting elected, all of that stuff is noticeably missing.

117
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,900
It's not on the top, it's not on the bottom.

118
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,640
It clearly belongs on the top and if this person put it on the chart at all, she would

119
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,500
have to put it on the bottom as per her biases, and that would be a glaring red flag, so I

120
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,920
think she just left them off and hoped no one would notice.

121
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,640
But the truth is, most people do not believe most of this stuff.

122
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,460
Most people could understand that a lot of conspiracy theories are just fun schlock,

123
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,580
fables that people tell each other to have a good time.

124
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,860
This chart, in practice, acts as a list of these stories, with the approved ones at the

125
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,680
bottom and the banned ones at the top.

126
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,420
The ones at the top have been placed there because they delegitimize, depoliticize and

127
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,600
make light of progressive and socialist causes and goals.

128
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,940
In my previous video, I showed a bunch of articles and takes, and it's time to go over

129
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,240
a few of those in a bit more depth.

130
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
Consider this.

131
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,020
Astrology is a gateway to fascism.

132
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,900
All such mysticism that seeks to explain human behavior as inborn and predetermined rather

133
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,460
than as a result of material conditions is like this.

134
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,460
It is not misogyny to point this out.

135
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,420
Why would somebody believe this to be true?

136
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,020
I mean, okay, she says it in the tweet.

137
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,180
She says all such mysticism that seeks to explain human behavior as inborn and predetermined

138
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,600
rather than as a result of material conditions is fascist.

139
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,640
That is the Marxist view taken to its extreme again.

140
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,460
But why does she think that a rejection of Marxist historical materialist view is fascist?

141
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,880
Historical materialism seeks to scientifically understand history, and I say that with the

142
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,300
biggest air quotes I can muster, by stripping history of its ideological framework and looking

143
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,800
only at the material conditions of the event.

144
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,380
In other words, all historical wars must be wars of resources, not wars of ethnicity,

145
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,880
nationality, religion or political persuasion.

146
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,320
Any belief counter to this must conclude that material conditions is not the only variable

147
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,760
and that there must be other causes determining human behavior, whether that's an appeal

148
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,760
to genetics or faith in an ideology or anything else.

149
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,700
It must be fascist.

150
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,900
And so because astrology is an analysis of the world that rejects materialism, it must

151
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,540
be a gateway to fascism.

152
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,860
And no, this isn't just some dumb fuck Twitter user saying this out of nowhere.

153
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,700
In Theodore Adorno's The Stars Down to Earth, he writes, the tendency to occultism is a

154
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,880
symptom of the regression in consciousness.

155
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,780
This has lost the power to think the unconditional and to endure the conditional.

156
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:59,060
Instead of defining both in their unity and difference by conceptual labor, it mixes them

157
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,100
indiscriminately.

158
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,300
The unconditional becomes fact, the conditional an immediate essence.

159
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,780
By its regression to magic under late capitalism, thought is assimilated to late capitalist

160
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,780
forms.

161
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,500
The hypnotic power exerted by things occult resembles totalitarian terror and present

162
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,020
day processes the two are merged.

163
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,960
The power of occultism, as of fascism, to which it is connected by thought patterns

164
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,340
of the ilk of antisemitism is not only pathic, rather, it lies in the fact that in the lesser

165
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:27,120
panaceas, as in superimposed pictures, consciousness famished for truth imagines it is grasping

166
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,740
a dimly present knowledge, diligently denied to it by official progress in all its forms.

167
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,380
It is the knowledge that society by virtually excluding the possibility of spontaneous change

168
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,500
is gravitating towards total catastrophe.

169
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,020
In other words, fascism is capitalism decay.

170
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,180
The occult is part of fascist thought through both of their gravitation towards irrationalism

171
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,520
and the rejection of materialism and embracing the spiritual is a mental pathway to fascism.

172
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,640
Again, none of this is a part of fascist political theory.

173
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,340
The embracing of the occult, as well as irrationalism as a way of thinking, is one of the major

174
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,400
differences between Italy's classical fascism and Germany's national socialism.

175
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,280
And by the way, when I said that by the strictest definition of classical fascist theory, the

176
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,320
only true fascist states were Italy and Spain, I was correct.

177
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,080
In pre-Nazi Germany, individuals who would later become major players in the Nazi government,

178
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,020
notably excluding Hitler himself, were part of the Society of Thule, an occult organization

179
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,820
that ran from 1918 to 1925.

180
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,180
The views of this secret society would later provide the ideas of blood-purity and the

181
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,540
Nordic racial mysticism to Nazi political theory, and became the source of the mystic

182
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,280
elements of Nazism as seen in the previously mentioned pop culture references.

183
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,500
After World War II, a strand of thought came about called Esoteric Hitlerism, where New

184
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,540
Age religious movements adopted the more mystical aspects of Nazi ideology.

185
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,980
This is where the Black Sun symbol comes from, that you might see in both memes and legitimately

186
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,440
far-right stuff, as part of this belief system is in the mythical land called Hyperborea,

187
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,940
the ancient home of the original Aryans, a race of blonde-haired, blue-eyed, noble-blooded

188
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,760
giants, that Hitler's use of the swastika marked him as the 9th avatar of Vishnu, and

189
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,060
he ascended as a deity after his death.

190
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,700
And listen, there's way more to this than that, and it's all absolutely nonsense.

191
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,960
But this isn't a video on Esoteric Hitlerism, maybe we'll do one another time, but it's

192
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
really fucking dumb.

193
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,440
All you need to know for the purposes of this video is that it's all occult mumbo jumbo

194
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,520
that doesn't actually map onto anything in reality, and its adherents are part conspiracy

195
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,400
theory believer, and part spiritual nutcase.

196
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,180
And it's this specific strain of thought that uneducated leftists use to link up conspiracy

197
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,420
theories, the human capacity for spiritual experiences, and Nazism, and by extension

198
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,660
fascism, since they believe that Nazis and fascists are the same thing in all respects.

199
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,200
Even though fascist's spiritual component is explicitly worship of the state, and not

200
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,300
any of this racial mystic garbage.

201
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,760
Oh, and also, a lot of this comes from Julius Evola's writing, so when people call Evola

202
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,100
worshippers fascists, they're incorrect, but when they call them Nazis, that's actually

203
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,960
got a lot more weight to it.

204
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,000
They may not be economic Nazis, they may not be statist Nazis, but they are certainly spiritual

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Nazis.

206
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,180
And this point is just for me personally, I recently played a terrible FMV game on stream

207
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:08,600
called Black Dahlia made back in the 90s, about an Aryan wizard who was given a final

208
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,480
set of orders by Hitler to use a magic crystal once wielded by Germanic crusaders, the Black

209
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,860
Dahlia, to take over the world and conquer America.

210
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:21,000
The game is steeped in Nordic runes and old Germanic families and all that occult stuff,

211
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,520
and it actually knew the difference between fascism and Nazism.

212
00:12:38,600 --> 00:13:06,120
Man, that feel

213
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,740
when this garbage knows more political theory than people who claim to be politically engaged

214
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,740
nowadays.

215
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,920
Okay, that's enough dev ranting.

216
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,280
At this point, you should now understand how the left conceptually links fascism, Nazism,

217
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,200
spirituality, and conspiracy theory.

218
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,800
However factually inaccurate that may be, you now get their logic.

219
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,160
Okay, now you know why they view conservatives as fascists, because conservatives tend to

220
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,260
be more religious and more spiritual.

221
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:35,060
Now you know why they consider religious belief, or patriotism, or close ties with family or

222
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,860
culture or ethnicity, to be gateways to fascism, because these are beliefs with non-material

223
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,980
components.

224
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,300
That dreaded spirituality in religion, devotion to the bourgeois construction of the nation,

225
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,580
the homeland, in patriotism, and preference for the specific over the universal, valuing

226
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,840
metaphysical bonds with other particular individuals rather than treating people as atomized, faceless,

227
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
and replaceable.

228
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:02,220
If a thing has a non-material component, and love, relationships, friendships, honor, patriotism,

229
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,820
nostalgia, and spirituality all have non-material components, it's either fascist or fascist

230
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,120
adjacent, at least in the eyes of the most extreme of the left.

231
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,260
And so this view renders almost everybody and everything fascist.

232
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,760
Which is why they're calling everybody and everything fascist.

233
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,580
There's one final piece of the puzzle.

234
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,140
I went over these articles in other videos, we don't need to revisit them in too much

235
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,140
depth.

236
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,140
But I'll just remind you of them.

237
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,260
Trump and the Nazis, our troll in chief, has a deep affinity with the alt-right, and with

238
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,600
their ancestors.

239
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,260
After the outrage in Charlottesville, Donald Trump emerges as the leading alt-right troll,

240
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,860
a Hitler of lulz.

241
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,880
This article tries to link Trump to Nazism through online trolling, as if trolling itself

242
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,380
were a core component of Nazism.

243
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,380
Racists are recruiting.

244
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,380
Watch your white sons.

245
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,360
Parents need to understand how white supremacists prey on teen boys so they can intervene.

246
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,720
This is an opinion piece about a mother who almost crashed her car because her sons laughed

247
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,300
at a meme on their phone that used the word triggered, and how Nazis were recruiting feeble

248
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,400
young minds using memes.

249
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,660
From NPR, memes are the final boss level of appropriation.

250
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,060
What the hell does this all mean?

251
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,060
It turns out that most people who talk about conspiracy theories don't actually believe

252
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,520
in conspiracy theories.

253
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,520
Consider Armoured Skeptic.

254
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,400
He's largely abandoned politics videos and he now makes conspiracy theory content, talking

255
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,240
about bigfoot and UFOs and ancient aliens and the pyramids and whatever else.

256
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,360
It's all good fun.

257
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,480
It's nonsense.

258
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,780
Nobody actually believes it.

259
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,760
But telling tall tales for the entertainment of an audience, embellishing stories, creating

260
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,920
these new mythologies to influence people, it's all, technically speaking, lying to

261
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,720
people for fun.

262
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,000
Bigfoot doesn't actually exist.

263
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,300
But when you take on the role of a storyteller around a campfire, telling a very real story

264
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,040
about Bigfoot, I saw him with my own eyes you guys, you're doing multiple different

265
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
things.

266
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,040
1.

267
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
You're lying for entertainment.

268
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
2.

269
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,040
You're evoking an emotional response in your audience.

270
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,720
You're stirring their souls a little bit, if you're a particularly good storyteller.

271
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,400
You're grasping at the metaphysical aspect of them, because there's clearly no material

272
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
Bigfoot.

273
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
3.

274
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,480
There's a new technology, a new belief system that is fundamentally inaccurate about the

275
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
world.

276
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,220
And no, it doesn't matter if people don't actually believe it, because it's still

277
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,880
got a place in that conspiracy theory chart in the end.

278
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,320
In indulging the non-material, the irrational, even just for fun, to these people you are

279
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,220
creating a space for fascism.

280
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,520
Does this make armored skeptic a fascist by their ridiculous definition?

281
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,300
Well, yes.

282
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,000
It makes everybody but their purest members a fascist.

283
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,720
So when 4chan makes jokes about chemtrails or jet fuel not melting steel beams, even

284
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,060
though it's comedy, it's also technically not true, making it a conspiracy theory, making

285
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,940
it an irrational belief, making it a component of the irrationalist wing of Nazism through

286
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,980
esoteric Hitlerism, making it fascist.

287
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,980
You got all that?

288
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,980
I'm not saying this is the exact, direct thought process of every single dyed hair

289
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,520
hipster latte-sipping journo who write such articles as how to stop your child from being

290
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,280
an online internet troll, they're not actually smart enough to know all this shit, but the

291
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,880
underlying philosophy that guides them, the people who influenced them back when they

292
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,040
were at university, this is the ideological framework that they're operating from within.

293
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,600
All trolls and pranks are therefore, to them, fascist.

294
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,260
Edgy YouTubers and streamers, the prank-centric, shock-humor, gross-out content of the 90s,

295
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,040
it's all just latent fascism, and nobody knew it until the professors told them.

296
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,340
Pepe must be a fascist, the okay hand symbol's fascist, milk drinking is fascist, places

297
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,440
that still find trolling funny, 4chan and Newgrounds, they're all fascist enablers,

298
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:22,360
nobody user a nazi, and so every time somebody pulls a prank, it's gotta be them darn far

299
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,660
right neo-nazis again, it can't just be kids having fun.

300
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,000
The point of my last video was to describe at least some of the infinitely long list

301
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,560
of things that the left views as fascist.

302
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,900
The point of this video is to describe to you why they view it as fascist.

303
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,220
I'll leave you with a prediction.

304
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,460
The ways in which the left embraces spirituality nowadays, if the progressives are still wielding

305
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,680
hegemonic cultural influence in 20 years, will be considered highly problematic by that

306
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
time.

307
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,280
We've already seen the beginnings of this, because also on that conspiracy chart was

308
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,020
Essential Oils Cures Everything, and that was considered a leftist position up until

309
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,080
very recently.

310
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,300
The Essential Oils thing was only believed in by the hippy-dippy, anti-vaxx, all-organic,

311
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,540
peace-and-love style progressives.

312
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,160
You've got stoners and trippers, almost always more left-leaning than right, who do

313
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,620
self-research into psychedelics and buddhism and ego-death in order to find themselves

314
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,260
and induce spiritual experiences and whatever else, and the non-material realizations that

315
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:18,120
come from those experiences will only be more demonized by materialists over time.

316
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,820
You've got trans-spiritualists too, who spout nonsense like, trans people have fundamentally

317
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,760
different spiritual experiences than cis people, and religious ecstasy has more in common with

318
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,160
sex than anything else.

319
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,800
These might actually be true statements, I don't know, but a political persuasion that

320
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,520
rejects the metaphysical will not tolerate this point of view indefinitely.

321
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,560
I've made jokes in the past about how Aboriginal activists are actually Nazis, but I wonder

322
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,800
if the left will eventually reach that logical conclusion.

323
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,820
They are heavily spiritual, and that spirituality is intrinsically tied up in their ethnicity.

324
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,260
Their connection to their land is based on their blood and their race, and they certainly

325
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,980
spend a lot of time calling for living space.

326
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,900
This is some blood and soil shit.

327
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,940
The most insidious thing of all, this linking of the spiritual, the conspiracy, and the

328
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,900
Nazi, is how all you have to do to be considered a Nazi now is just ask questions that aren't

329
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,900
approved of.

330
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,860
For example, if a year and a half ago, you said that you believed there would be vaccine

331
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,660
passports or mandatory vaccination requirements as a result of the pandemic, not only were

332
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,240
you told that it wasn't going to happen, but you were told that just for thinking it,

333
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,200
just for voicing it, you were a conspiracy theorist who was dangerous and needed to take

334
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,400
off the tinfoil hat and stop being a Nazi, even though those very things are actually

335
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
happening right now.

336
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,580
If a conspiracy theory is no longer a conspiracy theory, but has in fact become reality, are

337
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,600
you really a Nazi simply because you were thinking ahead of the curve?

338
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,280
Or is it that the left's view of Nazism is fundamentally flawed, and purposefully so,

339
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,580
that it may be used as a tool to silence good faith questioning and bludgeon non-compliers?

340
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,200
The answer to that question is pretty easy to find.

341
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,900
Just tell any of these people no, and see what happens.

342
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,580
Alright guys, that about does it for me today.

343
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,420
I hope you enjoyed the video, and I hope you excuse me for taking as long as I did.

344
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,860
Hopefully you understand why the wait was required.

345
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,540
I'm streaming tonight on the gaming channel, twitch.tv slash game boomers, make sure you

346
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,020
drop in, and I will see you there.

347
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,020
Have a good one.

348
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,180
I love you.

349
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,780
Bye.
