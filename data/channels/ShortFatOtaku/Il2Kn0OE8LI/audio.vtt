00:00.000 --> 00:05.700
What is a Fascist?

00:05.700 --> 00:09.740
In my last video titled What is a Fascist?, I discussed what a fascist isn't.

00:09.740 --> 00:12.280
Notice those quotation marks in the title, lol got em.

00:12.280 --> 00:16.780
The point of that video was to go over the long list of things that are clearly not fascism.

00:16.780 --> 00:21.480
As in, they cannot be found in the works of classical fascist political theory by Benito

00:21.480 --> 00:26.980
Mussolini, Giovanni Gentile, Alfredo Rocco, and yet these things are routinely and incorrectly

00:26.980 --> 00:32.140
called fascist by terminally online brainlets who don't know anything about politics beyond

00:32.140 --> 00:34.300
what their favorite talking head tells them to think.

00:34.300 --> 00:37.500
To these people, fascist has come to mean almost anything.

00:37.500 --> 00:38.840
Anything on the right, certainly.

00:38.840 --> 00:42.480
Anything remotely capitalistic, including liberalism, as dumb as that is considering

00:42.480 --> 00:44.480
actual fascist economic thought.

00:44.480 --> 00:48.900
Anything that has even a whiff of the non-material, as Marxist historical materialism demands

00:48.900 --> 00:53.540
that only material conditions are factors in historic events, and that ideology is always

00:53.540 --> 00:55.260
secondary, which is clearly stupid.

00:55.260 --> 00:58.740
And yes, anything that's funny, because the issues of our time are so serious that

00:58.740 --> 01:02.300
there cannot be any levity, because levity means taking a break from being an always

01:02.300 --> 01:06.300
on, always political agent, and as we know, everything is political.

01:06.300 --> 01:10.740
Now that sounds like crazy talk, surely even the most extreme of leftist activists have

01:10.740 --> 01:11.740
downtime.

01:11.740 --> 01:15.020
And yes, they do, but to the extent that they do is the extent to which they are hypocritical,

01:15.020 --> 01:17.540
because this is the natural end result of their politics.

01:17.540 --> 01:18.820
Let me show you how.

01:18.820 --> 01:22.120
This tweet went viral last week, and it's the centerpiece of what I'm talking about.

01:22.120 --> 01:24.900
Conspiracy theories are everywhere, and people don't understand how harmful they are.

01:25.060 --> 01:26.060
Check out this chart.

01:26.060 --> 01:29.340
At the bottom we've got grounded in reality, and the first section is labeled things that

01:29.340 --> 01:30.340
actually happened.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.700
And yeah, these are real events that were covered up and then later revealed to be true.

01:33.700 --> 01:37.340
Nobody's going to argue that Nixon had his slammy paws in Watergate, or that the FBI

01:37.340 --> 01:40.780
spied on MLK, or that the government experimented on black Americans in Tuskegee.

01:40.780 --> 01:42.580
This is all stuff that we have proof for.

01:42.580 --> 01:46.820
Right above that is the speculation line, and the next section is labeled we have questions.

01:46.820 --> 01:51.120
Here we've got unsolved mysteries, or at least stories with some unknown components,

01:51.120 --> 01:54.920
like Epstein didn't kill himself, the Iran-Contra affair, and UFOs.

01:54.920 --> 01:58.920
The next section is above the leaving reality line, with the implication that the creator

01:58.920 --> 02:01.980
of this graph believes everything above this mark to be untrue.

02:01.980 --> 02:05.760
This section is titled unequivocally false but mostly harmless, and contains some really

02:05.760 --> 02:09.800
goofy stuff, like how Prince Charles is a vampire, Ted Cruz is a zodiac killer, and

02:09.800 --> 02:10.960
Elvis lives.

02:10.960 --> 02:15.360
Next up, past the reality denial line, is dangerous to yourself and others, and this

02:15.360 --> 02:17.360
is where some things start to get weird.

02:17.600 --> 02:21.760
Okay, Antifa did January 6th is obvious nonsense, and people who actually believe that are just

02:21.760 --> 02:22.760
huffing copium.

02:22.760 --> 02:27.040
Additionally, I highly doubt that vaccines contain microchips, but as far as I can tell,

02:27.040 --> 02:29.820
it's really only extreme crazies who actually believe it.

02:29.820 --> 02:31.880
Most people say it as a joke, it's a meme.

02:31.880 --> 02:34.720
It's fun to larp as somebody who's crazy, especially online.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.760
Same thing with the moon landing being fake.

02:36.760 --> 02:40.400
Same with jet fuel doesn't melt steel beams, that's literally a 4chan meme.

02:40.400 --> 02:44.960
Same with soy boys, that's just a funny observation showing a mostly coincidental connection between

02:44.960 --> 02:47.320
soy consumption and effeminate men on the left.

02:47.320 --> 02:49.060
And what the fuck, Biden's a robot?

02:49.060 --> 02:50.060
Who has ever said that?

02:50.060 --> 02:53.160
If he was a robot, you'd think they put something faster than a Pentium 2 in his brain.

02:53.160 --> 02:55.300
And a lot of these are justâ€¦ odd.

02:55.300 --> 02:59.280
The US presidential election was stolen is way up here, presumably referring to 2020,

02:59.280 --> 03:03.440
but if this chart were made in 2016, I guarantee you this person would put that right at the

03:03.440 --> 03:08.080
bottom, because randy lefty twitter accounts absolutely spent years screaming about morussian

03:08.080 --> 03:09.080
interference.

03:09.080 --> 03:11.000
And feral people in forests?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.480
That's actually true.

03:12.480 --> 03:16.400
Talk to anybody who's gone camping or hiking or trailblazing, it's reasonably common

03:16.400 --> 03:20.960
to walk off into the bush and encounter random homeless junkies who are just out there losing

03:20.960 --> 03:21.960
their fucking minds.

03:21.960 --> 03:26.200
Right at the top, past the antisemitic point of no return, no idea why it's suddenly

03:26.200 --> 03:31.040
antisemitic specifically, is the hilariously named section World Ruled by Supreme Shadow

03:31.040 --> 03:34.520
Elite Promotes Hatred and Violence Towards Marginalized Groups.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.600
Alright, let's see what's in here.

03:36.600 --> 03:40.960
Illuminati, Holocaust denial, deep state, QAnon, great replacement, new world order,

03:40.960 --> 03:44.760
secret satanic rituals, reptilian overlords, this is literally just a list of memes for

03:44.760 --> 03:48.400
most people, there are obviously real QAnon types out there, there are obviously real

03:48.400 --> 03:52.680
holocaust deniers, but a lot of this shit is actually said in jest.

03:52.680 --> 03:57.380
Most people who say this stuff are just having a laugh, Shirley ContraPoints isn't up here

03:57.380 --> 04:01.480
because she used the reptilian overlords meme in her capitalist video, right?

04:01.480 --> 04:04.140
Some of this stuff is clearly just jokes, like nazis on the moon.

04:04.140 --> 04:08.080
The extreme absurdification of nazism has been a cultural trope for 50 years now, starting

04:08.080 --> 04:13.040
with the legendary naziploitation movie Ilse, She Wolf of the SS, from 1974, where a smoking

04:13.040 --> 04:18.080
hot german woman ran a concentration camp and performed sexual experiments on the hot

04:18.080 --> 04:20.680
american prisoners of war that were brought under her control.

04:20.680 --> 04:25.140
It's a ridiculous, hilarious movie known for shock and schlock, but it was still wildly

04:25.140 --> 04:27.360
popular because of how over the top it was.

04:27.360 --> 04:31.420
It turns out that people like to see depraved fucked up shit, and they often find humor

04:31.420 --> 04:32.680
in its absurdity.

04:32.680 --> 04:36.920
Directly downstream from this absurdist view of nazism are things like the nazi vampires

04:36.920 --> 04:41.160
from hellsing, the mecha hitler from wolfenstein, the cryogenically frozen hitler clones in

04:41.160 --> 04:55.560
argentina and a variety of shitty movies, nazi obsession with ancient relics and artifacts

04:55.560 --> 05:00.280
with occult power like in the marvel movies or indiana jones, nazi werewolves, nazi ufos,

05:00.280 --> 05:02.200
and yes, nazi moon bases.

05:02.200 --> 05:06.400
You are not describing a real conspiracy theory here, you're describing a cultural trend of

05:06.400 --> 05:10.120
mocking nazis to the point of rendering them absurd, treating them like the jokes that

05:10.120 --> 05:11.120
they are.

05:11.120 --> 05:14.880
And, just like last time, you get a few things that actually have a ring of truth to them.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.360
The specific pizza shop surrounding pizzagate probably had nothing going on, but do you

05:18.360 --> 05:21.640
actually doubt that those among the rich elite of the world with an interest in children

05:21.640 --> 05:23.680
wouldn't be able to obtain them if they wanted?

05:23.680 --> 05:27.480
While hollywood is turning your kids gay is a bit too on the nose, do you think that there's

05:27.480 --> 05:31.760
not some sort of byproduct of the push to normalize alternate sexualities that might

05:31.760 --> 05:35.120
come in the form of people adopting identities they're not fully comfortable with in order

05:35.120 --> 05:36.120
to fit in?

05:36.120 --> 06:01.280
Especially when activists sing about it?

06:01.280 --> 06:04.080
Are you really going to say that cultural marxism is a conspiracy theory?

06:04.080 --> 06:08.520
When academia even just 10 years ago had no problem talking about it and analyzing

06:08.520 --> 06:12.700
its effects, while nowadays everybody screeches that it doesn't exist while citing sources

06:12.700 --> 06:16.200
of the people who are actually involved in it saying that it doesn't exist?

06:16.200 --> 06:20.000
This is some we have investigated ourselves and discovered we've done nothing wrong

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
type of shit.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.020
You should notice that all of the conspiracy theories that ended up being true but benefiting

06:25.020 --> 06:28.340
left wing causes are at the bottom of the chart, while all of the conspiracy theories

06:28.340 --> 06:31.800
that ended up being true but benefiting right wing causes are at the top.

06:31.800 --> 06:35.980
The more apolitical conspiracy theories are largely accurately placed, but when politics

06:35.980 --> 06:37.940
are at play there is a clear bias.

06:37.940 --> 06:42.160
And the really crazy leftist conspiracy theories, the ones that absolutely do belong at the

06:42.160 --> 06:46.840
very top of the chart as well, like how America or the CIA or whatever has caused every single

06:46.840 --> 06:50.340
instance of socialism to fail, or that dark money is flooding in and preventing shitty

06:50.340 --> 06:53.280
progressive candidates from getting elected, all of that stuff is noticeably missing.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.900
It's not on the top, it's not on the bottom.

06:54.900 --> 06:58.640
It clearly belongs on the top and if this person put it on the chart at all, she would

06:58.640 --> 07:02.500
have to put it on the bottom as per her biases, and that would be a glaring red flag, so I

07:02.500 --> 07:04.920
think she just left them off and hoped no one would notice.

07:04.920 --> 07:08.640
But the truth is, most people do not believe most of this stuff.

07:08.640 --> 07:12.460
Most people could understand that a lot of conspiracy theories are just fun schlock,

07:12.460 --> 07:14.580
fables that people tell each other to have a good time.

07:14.580 --> 07:18.860
This chart, in practice, acts as a list of these stories, with the approved ones at the

07:18.860 --> 07:20.680
bottom and the banned ones at the top.

07:20.680 --> 07:24.420
The ones at the top have been placed there because they delegitimize, depoliticize and

07:24.420 --> 07:27.600
make light of progressive and socialist causes and goals.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.940
In my previous video, I showed a bunch of articles and takes, and it's time to go over

07:30.940 --> 07:33.240
a few of those in a bit more depth.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.240
Consider this.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.020
Astrology is a gateway to fascism.

07:36.020 --> 07:40.900
All such mysticism that seeks to explain human behavior as inborn and predetermined rather

07:40.900 --> 07:43.460
than as a result of material conditions is like this.

07:43.460 --> 07:45.460
It is not misogyny to point this out.

07:45.460 --> 07:47.420
Why would somebody believe this to be true?

07:47.420 --> 07:49.020
I mean, okay, she says it in the tweet.

07:49.020 --> 07:53.180
She says all such mysticism that seeks to explain human behavior as inborn and predetermined

07:53.180 --> 07:55.600
rather than as a result of material conditions is fascist.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.640
That is the Marxist view taken to its extreme again.

07:57.640 --> 08:03.460
But why does she think that a rejection of Marxist historical materialist view is fascist?

08:03.460 --> 08:07.880
Historical materialism seeks to scientifically understand history, and I say that with the

08:07.880 --> 08:12.300
biggest air quotes I can muster, by stripping history of its ideological framework and looking

08:12.300 --> 08:14.800
only at the material conditions of the event.

08:14.800 --> 08:19.380
In other words, all historical wars must be wars of resources, not wars of ethnicity,

08:19.380 --> 08:21.880
nationality, religion or political persuasion.

08:21.880 --> 08:26.320
Any belief counter to this must conclude that material conditions is not the only variable

08:26.320 --> 08:29.760
and that there must be other causes determining human behavior, whether that's an appeal

08:29.760 --> 08:32.760
to genetics or faith in an ideology or anything else.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.700
It must be fascist.

08:34.700 --> 08:38.900
And so because astrology is an analysis of the world that rejects materialism, it must

08:38.900 --> 08:40.540
be a gateway to fascism.

08:40.540 --> 08:43.860
And no, this isn't just some dumb fuck Twitter user saying this out of nowhere.

08:43.860 --> 08:48.700
In Theodore Adorno's The Stars Down to Earth, he writes, the tendency to occultism is a

08:48.700 --> 08:50.880
symptom of the regression in consciousness.

08:50.880 --> 08:54.780
This has lost the power to think the unconditional and to endure the conditional.

08:54.780 --> 08:59.060
Instead of defining both in their unity and difference by conceptual labor, it mixes them

08:59.060 --> 09:00.100
indiscriminately.

09:00.100 --> 09:03.300
The unconditional becomes fact, the conditional an immediate essence.

09:03.300 --> 09:07.780
By its regression to magic under late capitalism, thought is assimilated to late capitalist

09:07.780 --> 09:08.780
forms.

09:08.780 --> 09:12.500
The hypnotic power exerted by things occult resembles totalitarian terror and present

09:12.500 --> 09:14.020
day processes the two are merged.

09:14.020 --> 09:17.960
The power of occultism, as of fascism, to which it is connected by thought patterns

09:17.960 --> 09:22.340
of the ilk of antisemitism is not only pathic, rather, it lies in the fact that in the lesser

09:22.340 --> 09:27.120
panaceas, as in superimposed pictures, consciousness famished for truth imagines it is grasping

09:27.120 --> 09:31.740
a dimly present knowledge, diligently denied to it by official progress in all its forms.

09:31.740 --> 09:36.380
It is the knowledge that society by virtually excluding the possibility of spontaneous change

09:36.380 --> 09:38.500
is gravitating towards total catastrophe.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.020
In other words, fascism is capitalism decay.

09:41.020 --> 09:45.180
The occult is part of fascist thought through both of their gravitation towards irrationalism

09:45.180 --> 09:49.520
and the rejection of materialism and embracing the spiritual is a mental pathway to fascism.

09:49.520 --> 09:52.640
Again, none of this is a part of fascist political theory.

09:52.640 --> 09:57.340
The embracing of the occult, as well as irrationalism as a way of thinking, is one of the major

09:57.340 --> 10:01.400
differences between Italy's classical fascism and Germany's national socialism.

10:01.400 --> 10:05.280
And by the way, when I said that by the strictest definition of classical fascist theory, the

10:05.280 --> 10:09.320
only true fascist states were Italy and Spain, I was correct.

10:09.320 --> 10:14.080
In pre-Nazi Germany, individuals who would later become major players in the Nazi government,

10:14.080 --> 10:19.020
notably excluding Hitler himself, were part of the Society of Thule, an occult organization

10:19.020 --> 10:21.820
that ran from 1918 to 1925.

10:21.820 --> 10:26.180
The views of this secret society would later provide the ideas of blood-purity and the

10:26.180 --> 10:30.540
Nordic racial mysticism to Nazi political theory, and became the source of the mystic

10:30.540 --> 10:35.280
elements of Nazism as seen in the previously mentioned pop culture references.

10:35.280 --> 10:39.500
After World War II, a strand of thought came about called Esoteric Hitlerism, where New

10:39.500 --> 10:43.540
Age religious movements adopted the more mystical aspects of Nazi ideology.

10:43.560 --> 10:47.980
This is where the Black Sun symbol comes from, that you might see in both memes and legitimately

10:47.980 --> 10:52.440
far-right stuff, as part of this belief system is in the mythical land called Hyperborea,

10:52.440 --> 10:56.940
the ancient home of the original Aryans, a race of blonde-haired, blue-eyed, noble-blooded

10:56.940 --> 11:01.760
giants, that Hitler's use of the swastika marked him as the 9th avatar of Vishnu, and

11:01.760 --> 11:04.060
he ascended as a deity after his death.

11:04.060 --> 11:07.700
And listen, there's way more to this than that, and it's all absolutely nonsense.

11:07.700 --> 11:11.960
But this isn't a video on Esoteric Hitlerism, maybe we'll do one another time, but it's

11:11.960 --> 11:12.960
really fucking dumb.

11:13.060 --> 11:16.440
All you need to know for the purposes of this video is that it's all occult mumbo jumbo

11:16.440 --> 11:20.520
that doesn't actually map onto anything in reality, and its adherents are part conspiracy

11:20.520 --> 11:23.400
theory believer, and part spiritual nutcase.

11:23.400 --> 11:28.180
And it's this specific strain of thought that uneducated leftists use to link up conspiracy

11:28.180 --> 11:32.420
theories, the human capacity for spiritual experiences, and Nazism, and by extension

11:32.420 --> 11:36.660
fascism, since they believe that Nazis and fascists are the same thing in all respects.

11:36.660 --> 11:40.200
Even though fascist's spiritual component is explicitly worship of the state, and not

11:40.200 --> 11:42.300
any of this racial mystic garbage.

11:42.740 --> 11:47.760
Oh, and also, a lot of this comes from Julius Evola's writing, so when people call Evola

11:47.760 --> 11:52.100
worshippers fascists, they're incorrect, but when they call them Nazis, that's actually

11:52.100 --> 11:53.960
got a lot more weight to it.

11:53.960 --> 11:59.000
They may not be economic Nazis, they may not be statist Nazis, but they are certainly spiritual

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Nazis.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.180
And this point is just for me personally, I recently played a terrible FMV game on stream

12:04.180 --> 12:08.600
called Black Dahlia made back in the 90s, about an Aryan wizard who was given a final

12:08.600 --> 12:13.480
set of orders by Hitler to use a magic crystal once wielded by Germanic crusaders, the Black

12:13.480 --> 12:15.860
Dahlia, to take over the world and conquer America.

12:15.860 --> 12:21.000
The game is steeped in Nordic runes and old Germanic families and all that occult stuff,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.520
and it actually knew the difference between fascism and Nazism.

12:38.600 --> 13:06.120
Man, that feel

13:06.120 --> 13:10.740
when this garbage knows more political theory than people who claim to be politically engaged

13:10.740 --> 13:11.740
nowadays.

13:11.740 --> 13:12.920
Okay, that's enough dev ranting.

13:12.920 --> 13:18.280
At this point, you should now understand how the left conceptually links fascism, Nazism,

13:18.280 --> 13:20.200
spirituality, and conspiracy theory.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.800
However factually inaccurate that may be, you now get their logic.

13:23.800 --> 13:28.160
Okay, now you know why they view conservatives as fascists, because conservatives tend to

13:28.160 --> 13:30.260
be more religious and more spiritual.

13:30.260 --> 13:35.060
Now you know why they consider religious belief, or patriotism, or close ties with family or

13:35.060 --> 13:39.860
culture or ethnicity, to be gateways to fascism, because these are beliefs with non-material

13:39.860 --> 13:40.980
components.

13:40.980 --> 13:45.300
That dreaded spirituality in religion, devotion to the bourgeois construction of the nation,

13:45.300 --> 13:49.580
the homeland, in patriotism, and preference for the specific over the universal, valuing

13:49.580 --> 13:54.840
metaphysical bonds with other particular individuals rather than treating people as atomized, faceless,

13:54.840 --> 13:55.840
and replaceable.

13:55.840 --> 14:02.220
If a thing has a non-material component, and love, relationships, friendships, honor, patriotism,

14:02.220 --> 14:07.820
nostalgia, and spirituality all have non-material components, it's either fascist or fascist

14:07.820 --> 14:11.120
adjacent, at least in the eyes of the most extreme of the left.

14:11.120 --> 14:16.260
And so this view renders almost everybody and everything fascist.

14:16.260 --> 14:18.760
Which is why they're calling everybody and everything fascist.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.580
There's one final piece of the puzzle.

14:20.580 --> 14:23.140
I went over these articles in other videos, we don't need to revisit them in too much

14:23.140 --> 14:24.140
depth.

14:24.140 --> 14:25.140
But I'll just remind you of them.

14:25.140 --> 14:28.260
Trump and the Nazis, our troll in chief, has a deep affinity with the alt-right, and with

14:28.260 --> 14:29.600
their ancestors.

14:29.600 --> 14:33.260
After the outrage in Charlottesville, Donald Trump emerges as the leading alt-right troll,

14:33.260 --> 14:34.860
a Hitler of lulz.

14:34.860 --> 14:38.880
This article tries to link Trump to Nazism through online trolling, as if trolling itself

14:38.880 --> 14:41.380
were a core component of Nazism.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.380
Racists are recruiting.

14:42.380 --> 14:43.380
Watch your white sons.

14:43.380 --> 14:47.360
Parents need to understand how white supremacists prey on teen boys so they can intervene.

14:47.360 --> 14:51.720
This is an opinion piece about a mother who almost crashed her car because her sons laughed

14:51.720 --> 14:56.300
at a meme on their phone that used the word triggered, and how Nazis were recruiting feeble

14:56.300 --> 14:58.400
young minds using memes.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.660
From NPR, memes are the final boss level of appropriation.

15:01.660 --> 15:03.060
What the hell does this all mean?

15:03.060 --> 15:07.060
It turns out that most people who talk about conspiracy theories don't actually believe

15:07.060 --> 15:08.520
in conspiracy theories.

15:08.520 --> 15:09.520
Consider Armoured Skeptic.

15:09.520 --> 15:13.400
He's largely abandoned politics videos and he now makes conspiracy theory content, talking

15:13.400 --> 15:17.240
about bigfoot and UFOs and ancient aliens and the pyramids and whatever else.

15:17.240 --> 15:18.360
It's all good fun.

15:18.360 --> 15:19.480
It's nonsense.

15:19.480 --> 15:20.780
Nobody actually believes it.

15:20.780 --> 15:24.760
But telling tall tales for the entertainment of an audience, embellishing stories, creating

15:24.760 --> 15:28.920
these new mythologies to influence people, it's all, technically speaking, lying to

15:28.920 --> 15:30.720
people for fun.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.000
Bigfoot doesn't actually exist.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.300
But when you take on the role of a storyteller around a campfire, telling a very real story

15:36.300 --> 15:40.040
about Bigfoot, I saw him with my own eyes you guys, you're doing multiple different

15:40.040 --> 15:41.040
things.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.040
1.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.040
You're lying for entertainment.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.040
2.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.040
You're evoking an emotional response in your audience.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.720
You're stirring their souls a little bit, if you're a particularly good storyteller.

15:47.720 --> 15:51.400
You're grasping at the metaphysical aspect of them, because there's clearly no material

15:51.400 --> 15:52.400
Bigfoot.

15:52.400 --> 15:53.400
3.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.480
There's a new technology, a new belief system that is fundamentally inaccurate about the

15:56.480 --> 15:57.480
world.

15:57.480 --> 16:00.220
And no, it doesn't matter if people don't actually believe it, because it's still

16:00.220 --> 16:02.880
got a place in that conspiracy theory chart in the end.

16:02.880 --> 16:08.320
In indulging the non-material, the irrational, even just for fun, to these people you are

16:08.320 --> 16:10.220
creating a space for fascism.

16:10.220 --> 16:13.520
Does this make armored skeptic a fascist by their ridiculous definition?

16:13.520 --> 16:15.300
Well, yes.

16:15.300 --> 16:19.000
It makes everybody but their purest members a fascist.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.720
So when 4chan makes jokes about chemtrails or jet fuel not melting steel beams, even

16:22.720 --> 16:27.060
though it's comedy, it's also technically not true, making it a conspiracy theory, making

16:27.060 --> 16:31.940
it an irrational belief, making it a component of the irrationalist wing of Nazism through

16:31.940 --> 16:34.980
esoteric Hitlerism, making it fascist.

16:34.980 --> 16:35.980
You got all that?

16:35.980 --> 16:39.980
I'm not saying this is the exact, direct thought process of every single dyed hair

16:39.980 --> 16:44.520
hipster latte-sipping journo who write such articles as how to stop your child from being

16:44.520 --> 16:48.280
an online internet troll, they're not actually smart enough to know all this shit, but the

16:48.280 --> 16:51.880
underlying philosophy that guides them, the people who influenced them back when they

16:51.880 --> 16:56.040
were at university, this is the ideological framework that they're operating from within.

16:56.040 --> 16:59.600
All trolls and pranks are therefore, to them, fascist.

16:59.600 --> 17:05.260
Edgy YouTubers and streamers, the prank-centric, shock-humor, gross-out content of the 90s,

17:05.260 --> 17:09.040
it's all just latent fascism, and nobody knew it until the professors told them.

17:09.040 --> 17:13.340
Pepe must be a fascist, the okay hand symbol's fascist, milk drinking is fascist, places

17:13.340 --> 17:17.440
that still find trolling funny, 4chan and Newgrounds, they're all fascist enablers,

17:17.440 --> 17:22.360
nobody user a nazi, and so every time somebody pulls a prank, it's gotta be them darn far

17:22.360 --> 17:25.660
right neo-nazis again, it can't just be kids having fun.

17:25.660 --> 17:30.000
The point of my last video was to describe at least some of the infinitely long list

17:30.000 --> 17:32.560
of things that the left views as fascist.

17:32.560 --> 17:36.900
The point of this video is to describe to you why they view it as fascist.

17:36.900 --> 17:38.220
I'll leave you with a prediction.

17:38.220 --> 17:42.460
The ways in which the left embraces spirituality nowadays, if the progressives are still wielding

17:42.460 --> 17:46.680
hegemonic cultural influence in 20 years, will be considered highly problematic by that

17:46.680 --> 17:47.680
time.

17:47.680 --> 17:50.280
We've already seen the beginnings of this, because also on that conspiracy chart was

17:50.280 --> 17:54.020
Essential Oils Cures Everything, and that was considered a leftist position up until

17:54.020 --> 17:55.080
very recently.

17:55.080 --> 17:59.300
The Essential Oils thing was only believed in by the hippy-dippy, anti-vaxx, all-organic,

17:59.300 --> 18:00.540
peace-and-love style progressives.

18:00.540 --> 18:04.160
You've got stoners and trippers, almost always more left-leaning than right, who do

18:04.160 --> 18:08.620
self-research into psychedelics and buddhism and ego-death in order to find themselves

18:08.620 --> 18:13.260
and induce spiritual experiences and whatever else, and the non-material realizations that

18:13.260 --> 18:18.120
come from those experiences will only be more demonized by materialists over time.

18:18.120 --> 18:22.820
You've got trans-spiritualists too, who spout nonsense like, trans people have fundamentally

18:22.820 --> 18:26.760
different spiritual experiences than cis people, and religious ecstasy has more in common with

18:26.760 --> 18:28.160
sex than anything else.

18:28.160 --> 18:31.800
These might actually be true statements, I don't know, but a political persuasion that

18:31.800 --> 18:35.520
rejects the metaphysical will not tolerate this point of view indefinitely.

18:35.520 --> 18:39.560
I've made jokes in the past about how Aboriginal activists are actually Nazis, but I wonder

18:39.560 --> 18:41.800
if the left will eventually reach that logical conclusion.

18:41.800 --> 18:45.820
They are heavily spiritual, and that spirituality is intrinsically tied up in their ethnicity.

18:45.820 --> 18:49.260
Their connection to their land is based on their blood and their race, and they certainly

18:49.260 --> 18:50.980
spend a lot of time calling for living space.

18:50.980 --> 18:52.900
This is some blood and soil shit.

18:52.900 --> 18:56.940
The most insidious thing of all, this linking of the spiritual, the conspiracy, and the

18:56.940 --> 19:01.900
Nazi, is how all you have to do to be considered a Nazi now is just ask questions that aren't

19:01.900 --> 19:02.900
approved of.

19:02.900 --> 19:06.860
For example, if a year and a half ago, you said that you believed there would be vaccine

19:06.860 --> 19:11.660
passports or mandatory vaccination requirements as a result of the pandemic, not only were

19:11.660 --> 19:15.240
you told that it wasn't going to happen, but you were told that just for thinking it,

19:15.240 --> 19:19.200
just for voicing it, you were a conspiracy theorist who was dangerous and needed to take

19:19.200 --> 19:23.400
off the tinfoil hat and stop being a Nazi, even though those very things are actually

19:23.400 --> 19:24.400
happening right now.

19:24.400 --> 19:29.580
If a conspiracy theory is no longer a conspiracy theory, but has in fact become reality, are

19:29.580 --> 19:32.600
you really a Nazi simply because you were thinking ahead of the curve?

19:32.600 --> 19:37.280
Or is it that the left's view of Nazism is fundamentally flawed, and purposefully so,

19:37.280 --> 19:42.580
that it may be used as a tool to silence good faith questioning and bludgeon non-compliers?

19:42.580 --> 19:45.200
The answer to that question is pretty easy to find.

19:45.200 --> 19:48.900
Just tell any of these people no, and see what happens.

19:48.900 --> 19:50.580
Alright guys, that about does it for me today.

19:50.580 --> 19:54.420
I hope you enjoyed the video, and I hope you excuse me for taking as long as I did.

19:54.420 --> 19:56.860
Hopefully you understand why the wait was required.

19:56.860 --> 20:00.540
I'm streaming tonight on the gaming channel, twitch.tv slash game boomers, make sure you

20:00.540 --> 20:03.020
drop in, and I will see you there.

20:03.020 --> 20:04.020
Have a good one.

20:04.020 --> 20:04.180
I love you.

20:07.280 --> 20:07.780
Bye.
