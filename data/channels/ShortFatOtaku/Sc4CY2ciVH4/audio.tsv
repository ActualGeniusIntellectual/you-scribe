0	7480	Hey everybody, sorry for the absence.
7480	12520	I was sick for a bit longer and then my girlfriend got sick, so I've been gone for a while doing
12520	13520	stuff.
13520	17480	At the same time, I've also been working on a very large video about Justin Trudeau.
17480	21400	The third big Trudeau video I've done on this channel, because those of you who don't know,
21400	23300	there's a Canadian election coming up next week.
23300	26600	But it's high time I actually get something out, even if it's something small, isn't it?
26600	29040	A week ago, this happened here in Canada.
29040	35160	Book burning at Ontario Francophone schools as a gesture of reconciliation is denounced.
35160	39860	More than 4700 books were removed from the library shelves at 30 schools, and they have
39860	42740	since been destroyed or in the process of being recycled.
42740	48280	The Flame Purification Ceremony, I guess that's what they're calling a book burning now, is
48280	53080	a flame purification ceremony, was held in 2019.
53080	58240	Some 30 books were burned for educational purposes, and the ashes were used as fertilizer
58240	59360	to plant a tree.
59360	62620	We bury the ashes of racism, discrimination, and stereotypes in the hope that we will grow
62620	65720	up in an inclusive country where all can live in prosperity and security.
65720	67560	This sounds pretty bad, doesn't it?
67560	71960	Burning books because the political winds have changed, because it's 2021, or I guess
71960	75020	2019 in this example, but you know what I mean.
75020	78160	The Ontario Ministry of Education and the school board carried out a burning of children's
78160	82960	books such as Asterix, Tintin, Disney, some novels, biographies, or encyclopedias, accused
82960	86120	of being Eurocentric and giving a bad image of Indians.
86120	90280	Well, to be honest, that's actually a pretty good image, all things considered.
90280	95020	She's young and attractive and vibrant, and he's a fat dumb oaf, or maybe they're going
95020	96940	for the objectification angle.
96940	101440	Of course, it turned out that the people that they did this with, the aboriginal credentials
101440	105560	of the person they partnered with on the book burning project, are now in question.
105560	108600	I guess this is her, Susie Keys.
108600	110800	She's about as aboriginal as Elizabeth Warren.
110800	113080	It turns out it wasn't just the books that got burned.
113080	117560	The school board has acknowledged they were not aware of the aboriginal credentials of
117560	121520	a person they partnered with on the project are in question.
121520	127480	The person whose verification is under scrutiny is Barrie Area resident Susie Keys, an outspoken
127480	130960	First Nations advocate who has appeared on stage and in photographs with Prime Minister
130960	132000	Justin Trudeau.
132000	135480	She has now resigned from her indigenous leadership role within the Liberal Party.
135480	138320	Her indigenous status is now being questioned.
138320	143360	An October 1st, 2017 news release stated, the Indigenous People's Commission of the
143360	147560	Liberal Party of Canada is pleased to announce the appointment of Susie Keys to the position
147560	148560	of IPC co-chair.
148560	156640	Susie is an urban indigenous woman of Abenaki and Montanegs, and in a French interview she
156640	159580	said, my mother's family is from several communities.
159580	164160	On my grandfather's side, it's the Malecite from St. Mary's, New Brunswick, and there
164160	168920	are also the Laporte who are Innu, and my grandmother was Abenaki from Odenak.
168920	172860	But it turns out that Susie Keys does not actually have legal Indian status under the
172860	174220	Indian Act.
174220	177140	We were assured that Susie Keys was of aboriginal descent.
177140	180720	We had asked her directly, she confirmed that she was, and we took her at her word.
180720	186400	It turned out that Radio Canada decided to look into the records of those various bands
186400	189680	and couldn't find her family as being a part of any of them.
189680	191640	That doesn't necessarily mean that she's not native.
191640	195840	Maybe there's some old family folklore, you go back a few generations, you can find a
195840	196840	native person.
196840	198720	But it means that she doesn't have legal status.
198720	200680	To be honest, that's kind of where I am.
200680	204440	There is some family folklore about my great-great-grandmother being native.
204440	207100	And last I checked, the records show that to be true.
207100	208980	But also, I don't care.
208980	212740	I'm not juggling it around trying to get a job somewhere or something.
212740	215620	But we're talking about book burning, as funny as this is.
215620	219380	And book burning, as you know, is unfortunately not uncommon.
219380	223580	This week, dumpsters were filled with books that should have left decades ago and replaced
223580	228520	with engaging, relevant, culturally diverse literature.
228520	231980	This individual, of course, is in the New Jersey public school system.
231980	237580	This is insidious because her language talks about replacing old books with engaging, relevant,
237580	239560	and culturally diverse literature.
239560	244740	The point being that she views these as values and that these books she's getting rid of
244740	246460	don't have those values.
246460	250460	But then what do you want to do if you want to read books that don't have those values?
250460	252000	What if you don't share her values?
252000	255940	Or what if you do share her values but you want to hear somebody else's opinion?
255940	260080	This is the difference between offering an alternate point of view and censoring the
260080	261260	ones you don't like.
261260	266160	If you put your contradictory ideas out there, other people can examine yours and examine
266160	268940	other people's and figure out what they want from themselves.
268940	275240	But if you must replace those old ideas, then you are specifically trying to force a monopoly.
275280	277200	It's fine for you to not like Andy Ngo.
277200	280440	It's fine for you not to want to read his unmasked book.
280440	283200	But should somebody be cancelled for praising it?
283200	284200	Probably not.
284200	289920	Jordan Peterson's new book is being published by Penguin Random House, and the younger staff
289920	295960	working for that company are confronting management at a tearful town hall wanting it cancelled.
295960	300840	Several employees cried at the meeting discussing how Peterson's views have negatively impacted
300840	301920	their lives.
301920	306200	Peterson told me he's an icon of hate speech and transphobia, and the fact that he's an
306200	309880	icon of white supremacy, I'm not proud to work for a company that publishes him.
309880	313720	The book itself is actually quite tame, Jordan Peterson has never been a Nazi, and every
313720	317960	single person online who thinks so is absolutely fucking stupid.
317960	322560	There is no excuse for a grown-ass person to break down and cry because a book is being
322560	323560	published.
323560	328200	There was a big hullabaloo back in March about Dr. Seuss getting cancelled, remember that?
328200	332920	Those really old Dr. Seuss books that had jokes about race that aren't really in line
332920	336360	with today's progressive narrative but were completely fine for the time?
336360	340580	To the point that the cancelled books that actually held a book burning for them?
340580	345340	And for those people who still had copies of the books, eBay will not let you sell them
345340	346920	on its site?
346920	350580	Even though of course you can still go on eBay or Amazon for that matter and buy Mein
350580	351580	Kampf.
351580	356840	Forgetting of course that Dr. Seuss himself was not only a children's book author but
356840	360240	was also a political cartoonist, a progressive one at that.
360240	364080	And we cannot talk about modern book burning without talking about JK Rowling.
364080	366980	I know I'm getting on in years at this point but I wonder if some of you are old enough
366980	371680	to remember back in the late 90s and early 2000s when it was the religious right that
371680	374200	would take the Harry Potter books and burn them?
374200	377880	Because they were products of Satan, they talked about black magic and witchcraft and
377880	379680	they were turning people away from Christ.
379680	384360	The most well-documented example came out of the book A Universal History of the Destruction
384360	388980	of Books where on page 228 there is a passage dedicated to Harry Potter.
388980	392880	The crusade against Harry Potter deserves a chapter of its own but let us content ourselves
392880	397960	with just one example among many of the extremes of emotion aroused by the series.
397960	403640	On Sunday, December 30th, 2001, in Alamogordo, New Mexico, a religious community burned hundreds
403640	405960	of copies of JK Rowling's Harry Potter books.
405960	409700	Jack Brock, the leader of the Christ Community Church, explained that his intention was to
409700	413360	point out that Harry Potter was not appropriate for youngsters because it inspired them to
413360	415080	study witchcraft and magic.
415080	418880	The books are an abomination to God and to me and they are likely to destroy the lives
418880	419880	of many young people.
419880	423640	Of course, Brock and his flock admitted they never actually read a single Harry Potter
423640	427920	book but they did decide to toss a few Stephen King novels in the fire for good measure.
427920	432920	And I recall back in the day making fun of these people for being so stupid as to march
432920	437340	down the same path as the Nazis and burn books they didn't like.
437340	441320	But ever since 2017, well, the opposite has been happening.
441320	445080	JK Rowling, I just burned all my Harry Potter books after being a fan for 17 years.
445080	447280	The Philosopher's Stone was one of the first books I ever read.
447280	449060	I'm upset it has to be this way.
449060	452200	You embarrassed me, disgusted me, and I will never read your work again.
452200	453760	This is from a leftist.
453760	455120	The political winds have changed.
455120	461160	JK Rowling, back in 2001, was considered a radical feminist, certainly somebody on the
461160	462160	left.
462160	464400	And let's be honest here, she still is.
464400	467840	Leftists might not like TERFs, but TERFs are still a product of the left.
467840	472120	The right wing does not have any kind of philosophical basis from which feminism can
472120	473120	spring out of.
473120	478360	But as the left goes further and further left, and old leftist ideas get cast out, the same
478360	483160	progressives that loved Harry Potter 20 years ago and made it a cultural phenomenon, they're
483160	488480	now burning their books, with in fact one of the most famous TikToks of it happening
488480	493380	saying you have to stop using the death of the author as an excuse to have your cake
493380	494640	and eat it too.
494640	499680	This generally reflects the broader leftist trend in the past 20-30 years of becoming
499680	500920	more authoritarian.
500920	503040	The death of the author is a leftist idea.
503040	507620	It's basically the practice of divorcing the author from their work, so that you may be
507620	512000	able to analyze it without the specter of the author hanging over your head, so that
512000	517000	their intentions and their experiences and their politics don't influence your interpretation
517000	518000	of the work.
518000	521360	For a long time in the literary space, it was basically a way for people on the left
521360	525760	to say, this piece of literature lines up with what we're saying, so we should adopt
525760	528120	it, even if the author didn't actually go that way.
528120	532820	But the death of the author is also a great way to avoid this kind of censorship.
532820	536500	And so now that the left is on the cultural upswing again, they are abandoning the idea
536500	540160	because abandoning it allows them to burn books and censor people.
540160	544280	In 2019, feminists burned books about changing sexual orientation.
544280	545820	This is a classic now.
545820	549680	Back in 2014, feminists were burning the war against boys.
549720	555120	Chinese library officials are burning books that diverge from Communist Party ideology,
555120	558280	following in the footsteps of previous socialist regimes.
558280	564020	In Raskolnikov's letter to Stalin, he describes the widespread Soviet practice of burning
564020	566100	decadent Western books.
566100	570980	And the most famous book burners of them all, the Nazis, had a long list of books that needed
570980	571980	to be burned.
571980	576100	Works of traitors, immigrants, and authors from foreign countries who believe they can
576100	578720	attack and denigrate the new Germany.
578720	582400	The literature of Marxism, communism, and Bolshevism.
582400	583680	Pacifist literature.
583680	586760	Literature with liberal, democratic tendencies and attitudes.
586760	591280	All historic writings whose purpose it is to denigrate the origin, the spirit, and the
591280	592940	culture of the German Volk.
592940	598520	Books that advocate art which is decadent, bloodless, or purely constructivist.
598520	602960	Writings on sexuality and sexual education which serve the egocentric pleasure of the
602960	604180	individual.
604180	606840	Literature by Jewish authors, regardless of the field.
606840	611680	Popular entertainment literature that depicts life and life's goals in a superficial, unrealistic,
611680	616080	and sickly sweet manner, based on a bourgeois or upper class view of life.
616080	618160	Pornography and explicit literature.
618160	620400	All books degrading German purity.
620400	627320	By the way, those of you who still don't believe that Nazism is an anti-Marxist or post-Marxist
627320	633320	socialism, notice that not all socialist writers were banned, just the Marxists, the Communists,
633320	634700	and the Bolsheviks.
634700	636980	Notice that all the liberal writers were banned.
636980	642100	Notice that rather than appealing to tradition, writers that denigrated the new Germany were
642100	643100	banned.
643100	646220	And that writing based on a bourgeois view was banned.
646220	649800	It is a different socialism, but it is still socialism in the end.
649800	654020	And the books that the Soviets burned, and that the Chinese are burning today, are burned
654020	656820	for a very similar list of reasons.
656820	661060	All these guys, the religious people in America burning Harry Potter, the feminists burning
661060	663100	literature that goes against their ideas.
663100	667000	This is not necessarily a left or right thing, although there do seem to be more examples
667000	668660	in the left that doesn't discount the right.
668660	672240	The Taliban can be described certainly as a right-wing institution.
672240	675000	It's very religious and traditional, and they've also burned books.
675000	678200	The common thread here is authoritarianism.
678200	681740	It's the rejection of democracy, of the open society.
681740	685780	What binds all these groups together is their anti-liberalism.
685780	690120	There is not a single example here of a liberal burning books.
690120	691200	Cats do it.
691200	692200	Kings do it.
692200	693200	Emperors do it.
693200	694200	Fuhrers do it.
694200	695200	And Marshals do it.
695200	696640	Even trad-caths do it.
696640	700620	It's funny to see that video from Academic Agents' recent event where they go on about
700620	701620	burning books.
701620	704960	Oh wait, I can't even show you, they fucking took it down.
704960	707820	Oh, it's down to fix the face blurring.
707820	714460	The point is, there is no oppressive, totalitarian, and morally reprehensible movement that has
714460	720100	not at one point or another directed its hatred and barbarism against books.
720100	724460	And despite the wide array of differences of all of these groups, their justification
724460	725900	is always the same.
725900	728200	The books they're burning are incorrect.
728200	731300	And there's something about the burning of books specifically.
731300	736060	Shredding them or soaking them or smashing them or any other method of destroying them
736060	737460	just doesn't compare.
737460	741500	Neither does just banning or censoring them, like not being able to sell them or having
741500	743580	them confiscated when they're caught on you.
743580	744980	Shredding is a different level.
744980	750340	A book is like a little encapsulation of human wisdom.
750340	752420	It's a window into a certain part of history.
752420	757540	So to burn any kind of book, especially one that represents culture or belief or history
757540	762900	or politics, it feels like a direct attack on man's faculty of reason.
762900	768220	I think Heinrich Hein said it best when he, oh, this is Kraut, this is where Kraut got
768220	770300	his avatar from, alright.
770300	774740	Heinrich Hein said it best when he said, wherever they burn books, in the end, they will also
774740	776540	burn human beings.
776540	781220	And every single group that I have talked about today has either already done that or
781220	785160	is certainly capable of doing it if they ever gain power.
785160	791020	The book burning in Canada is just another data point in a very long tradition of people
791020	795620	finally going mask off, finally showing themselves to be the authoritarians they are.
795620	801420	It would seem to me that any single person that burns a book on some level must be anti-human
801420	802420	flourishing.
802420	806220	And if that's a bit too heavy for you, I'm going to direct you over to V's channel, where
806220	809940	he talked about the same story, but with a lot more humor.
809940	810940	I'll see you next time, guys.
810940	811940	I love you.
811940	828260	The Blame of Purification Ceremony, as reported by the Gospel of Radio-Canada, let us pray.
828260	834040	In the year of the Lord 2019, by the councils called the Erie-Kathulaki province, which
834040	841320	oversees elementary and secondary schools in southwestern Ontario.
