WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.480
Hey everybody, sorry for the absence.

00:07.480 --> 00:12.520
I was sick for a bit longer and then my girlfriend got sick, so I've been gone for a while doing

00:12.520 --> 00:13.520
stuff.

00:13.520 --> 00:17.480
At the same time, I've also been working on a very large video about Justin Trudeau.

00:17.480 --> 00:21.400
The third big Trudeau video I've done on this channel, because those of you who don't know,

00:21.400 --> 00:23.300
there's a Canadian election coming up next week.

00:23.300 --> 00:26.600
But it's high time I actually get something out, even if it's something small, isn't it?

00:26.600 --> 00:29.040
A week ago, this happened here in Canada.

00:29.040 --> 00:35.160
Book burning at Ontario Francophone schools as a gesture of reconciliation is denounced.

00:35.160 --> 00:39.860
More than 4700 books were removed from the library shelves at 30 schools, and they have

00:39.860 --> 00:42.740
since been destroyed or in the process of being recycled.

00:42.740 --> 00:48.280
The Flame Purification Ceremony, I guess that's what they're calling a book burning now, is

00:48.280 --> 00:53.080
a flame purification ceremony, was held in 2019.

00:53.080 --> 00:58.240
Some 30 books were burned for educational purposes, and the ashes were used as fertilizer

00:58.240 --> 00:59.360
to plant a tree.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.620
We bury the ashes of racism, discrimination, and stereotypes in the hope that we will grow

01:02.620 --> 01:05.720
up in an inclusive country where all can live in prosperity and security.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.560
This sounds pretty bad, doesn't it?

01:07.560 --> 01:11.960
Burning books because the political winds have changed, because it's 2021, or I guess

01:11.960 --> 01:15.020
2019 in this example, but you know what I mean.

01:15.020 --> 01:18.160
The Ontario Ministry of Education and the school board carried out a burning of children's

01:18.160 --> 01:22.960
books such as Asterix, Tintin, Disney, some novels, biographies, or encyclopedias, accused

01:22.960 --> 01:26.120
of being Eurocentric and giving a bad image of Indians.

01:26.120 --> 01:30.280
Well, to be honest, that's actually a pretty good image, all things considered.

01:30.280 --> 01:35.020
She's young and attractive and vibrant, and he's a fat dumb oaf, or maybe they're going

01:35.020 --> 01:36.940
for the objectification angle.

01:36.940 --> 01:41.440
Of course, it turned out that the people that they did this with, the aboriginal credentials

01:41.440 --> 01:45.560
of the person they partnered with on the book burning project, are now in question.

01:45.560 --> 01:48.600
I guess this is her, Susie Keys.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.800
She's about as aboriginal as Elizabeth Warren.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.080
It turns out it wasn't just the books that got burned.

01:53.080 --> 01:57.560
The school board has acknowledged they were not aware of the aboriginal credentials of

01:57.560 --> 02:01.520
a person they partnered with on the project are in question.

02:01.520 --> 02:07.480
The person whose verification is under scrutiny is Barrie Area resident Susie Keys, an outspoken

02:07.480 --> 02:10.960
First Nations advocate who has appeared on stage and in photographs with Prime Minister

02:10.960 --> 02:12.000
Justin Trudeau.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.480
She has now resigned from her indigenous leadership role within the Liberal Party.

02:15.480 --> 02:18.320
Her indigenous status is now being questioned.

02:18.320 --> 02:23.360
An October 1st, 2017 news release stated, the Indigenous People's Commission of the

02:23.360 --> 02:27.560
Liberal Party of Canada is pleased to announce the appointment of Susie Keys to the position

02:27.560 --> 02:28.560
of IPC co-chair.

02:28.560 --> 02:36.640
Susie is an urban indigenous woman of Abenaki and Montanegs, and in a French interview she

02:36.640 --> 02:39.580
said, my mother's family is from several communities.

02:39.580 --> 02:44.160
On my grandfather's side, it's the Malecite from St. Mary's, New Brunswick, and there

02:44.160 --> 02:48.920
are also the Laporte who are Innu, and my grandmother was Abenaki from Odenak.

02:48.920 --> 02:52.860
But it turns out that Susie Keys does not actually have legal Indian status under the

02:52.860 --> 02:54.220
Indian Act.

02:54.220 --> 02:57.140
We were assured that Susie Keys was of aboriginal descent.

02:57.140 --> 03:00.720
We had asked her directly, she confirmed that she was, and we took her at her word.

03:00.720 --> 03:06.400
It turned out that Radio Canada decided to look into the records of those various bands

03:06.400 --> 03:09.680
and couldn't find her family as being a part of any of them.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.640
That doesn't necessarily mean that she's not native.

03:11.640 --> 03:15.840
Maybe there's some old family folklore, you go back a few generations, you can find a

03:15.840 --> 03:16.840
native person.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.720
But it means that she doesn't have legal status.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.680
To be honest, that's kind of where I am.

03:20.680 --> 03:24.440
There is some family folklore about my great-great-grandmother being native.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.100
And last I checked, the records show that to be true.

03:27.100 --> 03:28.980
But also, I don't care.

03:28.980 --> 03:32.740
I'm not juggling it around trying to get a job somewhere or something.

03:32.740 --> 03:35.620
But we're talking about book burning, as funny as this is.

03:35.620 --> 03:39.380
And book burning, as you know, is unfortunately not uncommon.

03:39.380 --> 03:43.580
This week, dumpsters were filled with books that should have left decades ago and replaced

03:43.580 --> 03:48.520
with engaging, relevant, culturally diverse literature.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.980
This individual, of course, is in the New Jersey public school system.

03:51.980 --> 03:57.580
This is insidious because her language talks about replacing old books with engaging, relevant,

03:57.580 --> 03:59.560
and culturally diverse literature.

03:59.560 --> 04:04.740
The point being that she views these as values and that these books she's getting rid of

04:04.740 --> 04:06.460
don't have those values.

04:06.460 --> 04:10.460
But then what do you want to do if you want to read books that don't have those values?

04:10.460 --> 04:12.000
What if you don't share her values?

04:12.000 --> 04:15.940
Or what if you do share her values but you want to hear somebody else's opinion?

04:15.940 --> 04:20.080
This is the difference between offering an alternate point of view and censoring the

04:20.080 --> 04:21.260
ones you don't like.

04:21.260 --> 04:26.160
If you put your contradictory ideas out there, other people can examine yours and examine

04:26.160 --> 04:28.940
other people's and figure out what they want from themselves.

04:28.940 --> 04:35.240
But if you must replace those old ideas, then you are specifically trying to force a monopoly.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.200
It's fine for you to not like Andy Ngo.

04:37.200 --> 04:40.440
It's fine for you not to want to read his unmasked book.

04:40.440 --> 04:43.200
But should somebody be cancelled for praising it?

04:43.200 --> 04:44.200
Probably not.

04:44.200 --> 04:49.920
Jordan Peterson's new book is being published by Penguin Random House, and the younger staff

04:49.920 --> 04:55.960
working for that company are confronting management at a tearful town hall wanting it cancelled.

04:55.960 --> 05:00.840
Several employees cried at the meeting discussing how Peterson's views have negatively impacted

05:00.840 --> 05:01.920
their lives.

05:01.920 --> 05:06.200
Peterson told me he's an icon of hate speech and transphobia, and the fact that he's an

05:06.200 --> 05:09.880
icon of white supremacy, I'm not proud to work for a company that publishes him.

05:09.880 --> 05:13.720
The book itself is actually quite tame, Jordan Peterson has never been a Nazi, and every

05:13.720 --> 05:17.960
single person online who thinks so is absolutely fucking stupid.

05:17.960 --> 05:22.560
There is no excuse for a grown-ass person to break down and cry because a book is being

05:22.560 --> 05:23.560
published.

05:23.560 --> 05:28.200
There was a big hullabaloo back in March about Dr. Seuss getting cancelled, remember that?

05:28.200 --> 05:32.920
Those really old Dr. Seuss books that had jokes about race that aren't really in line

05:32.920 --> 05:36.360
with today's progressive narrative but were completely fine for the time?

05:36.360 --> 05:40.580
To the point that the cancelled books that actually held a book burning for them?

05:40.580 --> 05:45.340
And for those people who still had copies of the books, eBay will not let you sell them

05:45.340 --> 05:46.920
on its site?

05:46.920 --> 05:50.580
Even though of course you can still go on eBay or Amazon for that matter and buy Mein

05:50.580 --> 05:51.580
Kampf.

05:51.580 --> 05:56.840
Forgetting of course that Dr. Seuss himself was not only a children's book author but

05:56.840 --> 06:00.240
was also a political cartoonist, a progressive one at that.

06:00.240 --> 06:04.080
And we cannot talk about modern book burning without talking about JK Rowling.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.980
I know I'm getting on in years at this point but I wonder if some of you are old enough

06:06.980 --> 06:11.680
to remember back in the late 90s and early 2000s when it was the religious right that

06:11.680 --> 06:14.200
would take the Harry Potter books and burn them?

06:14.200 --> 06:17.880
Because they were products of Satan, they talked about black magic and witchcraft and

06:17.880 --> 06:19.680
they were turning people away from Christ.

06:19.680 --> 06:24.360
The most well-documented example came out of the book A Universal History of the Destruction

06:24.360 --> 06:28.980
of Books where on page 228 there is a passage dedicated to Harry Potter.

06:28.980 --> 06:32.880
The crusade against Harry Potter deserves a chapter of its own but let us content ourselves

06:32.880 --> 06:37.960
with just one example among many of the extremes of emotion aroused by the series.

06:37.960 --> 06:43.640
On Sunday, December 30th, 2001, in Alamogordo, New Mexico, a religious community burned hundreds

06:43.640 --> 06:45.960
of copies of JK Rowling's Harry Potter books.

06:45.960 --> 06:49.700
Jack Brock, the leader of the Christ Community Church, explained that his intention was to

06:49.700 --> 06:53.360
point out that Harry Potter was not appropriate for youngsters because it inspired them to

06:53.360 --> 06:55.080
study witchcraft and magic.

06:55.080 --> 06:58.880
The books are an abomination to God and to me and they are likely to destroy the lives

06:58.880 --> 06:59.880
of many young people.

06:59.880 --> 07:03.640
Of course, Brock and his flock admitted they never actually read a single Harry Potter

07:03.640 --> 07:07.920
book but they did decide to toss a few Stephen King novels in the fire for good measure.

07:07.920 --> 07:12.920
And I recall back in the day making fun of these people for being so stupid as to march

07:12.920 --> 07:17.340
down the same path as the Nazis and burn books they didn't like.

07:17.340 --> 07:21.320
But ever since 2017, well, the opposite has been happening.

07:21.320 --> 07:25.080
JK Rowling, I just burned all my Harry Potter books after being a fan for 17 years.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.280
The Philosopher's Stone was one of the first books I ever read.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.060
I'm upset it has to be this way.

07:29.060 --> 07:32.200
You embarrassed me, disgusted me, and I will never read your work again.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.760
This is from a leftist.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.120
The political winds have changed.

07:35.120 --> 07:41.160
JK Rowling, back in 2001, was considered a radical feminist, certainly somebody on the

07:41.160 --> 07:42.160
left.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.400
And let's be honest here, she still is.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.840
Leftists might not like TERFs, but TERFs are still a product of the left.

07:47.840 --> 07:52.120
The right wing does not have any kind of philosophical basis from which feminism can

07:52.120 --> 07:53.120
spring out of.

07:53.120 --> 07:58.360
But as the left goes further and further left, and old leftist ideas get cast out, the same

07:58.360 --> 08:03.160
progressives that loved Harry Potter 20 years ago and made it a cultural phenomenon, they're

08:03.160 --> 08:08.480
now burning their books, with in fact one of the most famous TikToks of it happening

08:08.480 --> 08:13.380
saying you have to stop using the death of the author as an excuse to have your cake

08:13.380 --> 08:14.640
and eat it too.

08:14.640 --> 08:19.680
This generally reflects the broader leftist trend in the past 20-30 years of becoming

08:19.680 --> 08:20.920
more authoritarian.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.040
The death of the author is a leftist idea.

08:23.040 --> 08:27.620
It's basically the practice of divorcing the author from their work, so that you may be

08:27.620 --> 08:32.000
able to analyze it without the specter of the author hanging over your head, so that

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
their intentions and their experiences and their politics don't influence your interpretation

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
of the work.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.360
For a long time in the literary space, it was basically a way for people on the left

08:41.360 --> 08:45.760
to say, this piece of literature lines up with what we're saying, so we should adopt

08:45.760 --> 08:48.120
it, even if the author didn't actually go that way.

08:48.120 --> 08:52.820
But the death of the author is also a great way to avoid this kind of censorship.

08:52.820 --> 08:56.500
And so now that the left is on the cultural upswing again, they are abandoning the idea

08:56.500 --> 09:00.160
because abandoning it allows them to burn books and censor people.

09:00.160 --> 09:04.280
In 2019, feminists burned books about changing sexual orientation.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.820
This is a classic now.

09:05.820 --> 09:09.680
Back in 2014, feminists were burning the war against boys.

09:09.720 --> 09:15.120
Chinese library officials are burning books that diverge from Communist Party ideology,

09:15.120 --> 09:18.280
following in the footsteps of previous socialist regimes.

09:18.280 --> 09:24.020
In Raskolnikov's letter to Stalin, he describes the widespread Soviet practice of burning

09:24.020 --> 09:26.100
decadent Western books.

09:26.100 --> 09:30.980
And the most famous book burners of them all, the Nazis, had a long list of books that needed

09:30.980 --> 09:31.980
to be burned.

09:31.980 --> 09:36.100
Works of traitors, immigrants, and authors from foreign countries who believe they can

09:36.100 --> 09:38.720
attack and denigrate the new Germany.

09:38.720 --> 09:42.400
The literature of Marxism, communism, and Bolshevism.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.680
Pacifist literature.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.760
Literature with liberal, democratic tendencies and attitudes.

09:46.760 --> 09:51.280
All historic writings whose purpose it is to denigrate the origin, the spirit, and the

09:51.280 --> 09:52.940
culture of the German Volk.

09:52.940 --> 09:58.520
Books that advocate art which is decadent, bloodless, or purely constructivist.

09:58.520 --> 10:02.960
Writings on sexuality and sexual education which serve the egocentric pleasure of the

10:02.960 --> 10:04.180
individual.

10:04.180 --> 10:06.840
Literature by Jewish authors, regardless of the field.

10:06.840 --> 10:11.680
Popular entertainment literature that depicts life and life's goals in a superficial, unrealistic,

10:11.680 --> 10:16.080
and sickly sweet manner, based on a bourgeois or upper class view of life.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.160
Pornography and explicit literature.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.400
All books degrading German purity.

10:20.400 --> 10:27.320
By the way, those of you who still don't believe that Nazism is an anti-Marxist or post-Marxist

10:27.320 --> 10:33.320
socialism, notice that not all socialist writers were banned, just the Marxists, the Communists,

10:33.320 --> 10:34.700
and the Bolsheviks.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.980
Notice that all the liberal writers were banned.

10:36.980 --> 10:42.100
Notice that rather than appealing to tradition, writers that denigrated the new Germany were

10:42.100 --> 10:43.100
banned.

10:43.100 --> 10:46.220
And that writing based on a bourgeois view was banned.

10:46.220 --> 10:49.800
It is a different socialism, but it is still socialism in the end.

10:49.800 --> 10:54.020
And the books that the Soviets burned, and that the Chinese are burning today, are burned

10:54.020 --> 10:56.820
for a very similar list of reasons.

10:56.820 --> 11:01.060
All these guys, the religious people in America burning Harry Potter, the feminists burning

11:01.060 --> 11:03.100
literature that goes against their ideas.

11:03.100 --> 11:07.000
This is not necessarily a left or right thing, although there do seem to be more examples

11:07.000 --> 11:08.660
in the left that doesn't discount the right.

11:08.660 --> 11:12.240
The Taliban can be described certainly as a right-wing institution.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.000
It's very religious and traditional, and they've also burned books.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.200
The common thread here is authoritarianism.

11:18.200 --> 11:21.740
It's the rejection of democracy, of the open society.

11:21.740 --> 11:25.780
What binds all these groups together is their anti-liberalism.

11:25.780 --> 11:30.120
There is not a single example here of a liberal burning books.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.200
Cats do it.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.200
Kings do it.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.200
Emperors do it.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.200
Fuhrers do it.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.200
And Marshals do it.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.640
Even trad-caths do it.

11:36.640 --> 11:40.620
It's funny to see that video from Academic Agents' recent event where they go on about

11:40.620 --> 11:41.620
burning books.

11:41.620 --> 11:44.960
Oh wait, I can't even show you, they fucking took it down.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.820
Oh, it's down to fix the face blurring.

11:47.820 --> 11:54.460
The point is, there is no oppressive, totalitarian, and morally reprehensible movement that has

11:54.460 --> 12:00.100
not at one point or another directed its hatred and barbarism against books.

12:00.100 --> 12:04.460
And despite the wide array of differences of all of these groups, their justification

12:04.460 --> 12:05.900
is always the same.

12:05.900 --> 12:08.200
The books they're burning are incorrect.

12:08.200 --> 12:11.300
And there's something about the burning of books specifically.

12:11.300 --> 12:16.060
Shredding them or soaking them or smashing them or any other method of destroying them

12:16.060 --> 12:17.460
just doesn't compare.

12:17.460 --> 12:21.500
Neither does just banning or censoring them, like not being able to sell them or having

12:21.500 --> 12:23.580
them confiscated when they're caught on you.

12:23.580 --> 12:24.980
Shredding is a different level.

12:24.980 --> 12:30.340
A book is like a little encapsulation of human wisdom.

12:30.340 --> 12:32.420
It's a window into a certain part of history.

12:32.420 --> 12:37.540
So to burn any kind of book, especially one that represents culture or belief or history

12:37.540 --> 12:42.900
or politics, it feels like a direct attack on man's faculty of reason.

12:42.900 --> 12:48.220
I think Heinrich Hein said it best when he, oh, this is Kraut, this is where Kraut got

12:48.220 --> 12:50.300
his avatar from, alright.

12:50.300 --> 12:54.740
Heinrich Hein said it best when he said, wherever they burn books, in the end, they will also

12:54.740 --> 12:56.540
burn human beings.

12:56.540 --> 13:01.220
And every single group that I have talked about today has either already done that or

13:01.220 --> 13:05.160
is certainly capable of doing it if they ever gain power.

13:05.160 --> 13:11.020
The book burning in Canada is just another data point in a very long tradition of people

13:11.020 --> 13:15.620
finally going mask off, finally showing themselves to be the authoritarians they are.

13:15.620 --> 13:21.420
It would seem to me that any single person that burns a book on some level must be anti-human

13:21.420 --> 13:22.420
flourishing.

13:22.420 --> 13:26.220
And if that's a bit too heavy for you, I'm going to direct you over to V's channel, where

13:26.220 --> 13:29.940
he talked about the same story, but with a lot more humor.

13:29.940 --> 13:30.940
I'll see you next time, guys.

13:30.940 --> 13:31.940
I love you.

13:31.940 --> 13:48.260
The Blame of Purification Ceremony, as reported by the Gospel of Radio-Canada, let us pray.

13:48.260 --> 13:54.040
In the year of the Lord 2019, by the councils called the Erie-Kathulaki province, which

13:54.040 --> 14:01.320
oversees elementary and secondary schools in southwestern Ontario.
