1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
Hey everybody, sorry for the absence.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,520
I was sick for a bit longer and then my girlfriend got sick, so I've been gone for a while doing

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,520
stuff.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,480
At the same time, I've also been working on a very large video about Justin Trudeau.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,400
The third big Trudeau video I've done on this channel, because those of you who don't know,

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,300
there's a Canadian election coming up next week.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,600
But it's high time I actually get something out, even if it's something small, isn't it?

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,040
A week ago, this happened here in Canada.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:35,160
Book burning at Ontario Francophone schools as a gesture of reconciliation is denounced.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,860
More than 4700 books were removed from the library shelves at 30 schools, and they have

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,740
since been destroyed or in the process of being recycled.

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:48,280
The Flame Purification Ceremony, I guess that's what they're calling a book burning now, is

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,080
a flame purification ceremony, was held in 2019.

14
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,240
Some 30 books were burned for educational purposes, and the ashes were used as fertilizer

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,360
to plant a tree.

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,620
We bury the ashes of racism, discrimination, and stereotypes in the hope that we will grow

17
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,720
up in an inclusive country where all can live in prosperity and security.

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,560
This sounds pretty bad, doesn't it?

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,960
Burning books because the political winds have changed, because it's 2021, or I guess

20
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,020
2019 in this example, but you know what I mean.

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,160
The Ontario Ministry of Education and the school board carried out a burning of children's

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,960
books such as Asterix, Tintin, Disney, some novels, biographies, or encyclopedias, accused

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,120
of being Eurocentric and giving a bad image of Indians.

24
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,280
Well, to be honest, that's actually a pretty good image, all things considered.

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,020
She's young and attractive and vibrant, and he's a fat dumb oaf, or maybe they're going

26
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,940
for the objectification angle.

27
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,440
Of course, it turned out that the people that they did this with, the aboriginal credentials

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,560
of the person they partnered with on the book burning project, are now in question.

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,600
I guess this is her, Susie Keys.

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,800
She's about as aboriginal as Elizabeth Warren.

31
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,080
It turns out it wasn't just the books that got burned.

32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,560
The school board has acknowledged they were not aware of the aboriginal credentials of

33
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,520
a person they partnered with on the project are in question.

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,480
The person whose verification is under scrutiny is Barrie Area resident Susie Keys, an outspoken

35
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,960
First Nations advocate who has appeared on stage and in photographs with Prime Minister

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,000
Justin Trudeau.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,480
She has now resigned from her indigenous leadership role within the Liberal Party.

38
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,320
Her indigenous status is now being questioned.

39
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,360
An October 1st, 2017 news release stated, the Indigenous People's Commission of the

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,560
Liberal Party of Canada is pleased to announce the appointment of Susie Keys to the position

41
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,560
of IPC co-chair.

42
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:36,640
Susie is an urban indigenous woman of Abenaki and Montanegs, and in a French interview she

43
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,580
said, my mother's family is from several communities.

44
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,160
On my grandfather's side, it's the Malecite from St. Mary's, New Brunswick, and there

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,920
are also the Laporte who are Innu, and my grandmother was Abenaki from Odenak.

46
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,860
But it turns out that Susie Keys does not actually have legal Indian status under the

47
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,220
Indian Act.

48
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,140
We were assured that Susie Keys was of aboriginal descent.

49
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,720
We had asked her directly, she confirmed that she was, and we took her at her word.

50
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,400
It turned out that Radio Canada decided to look into the records of those various bands

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,680
and couldn't find her family as being a part of any of them.

52
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,640
That doesn't necessarily mean that she's not native.

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,840
Maybe there's some old family folklore, you go back a few generations, you can find a

54
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
native person.

55
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,720
But it means that she doesn't have legal status.

56
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,680
To be honest, that's kind of where I am.

57
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,440
There is some family folklore about my great-great-grandmother being native.

58
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,100
And last I checked, the records show that to be true.

59
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,980
But also, I don't care.

60
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,740
I'm not juggling it around trying to get a job somewhere or something.

61
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,620
But we're talking about book burning, as funny as this is.

62
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,380
And book burning, as you know, is unfortunately not uncommon.

63
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,580
This week, dumpsters were filled with books that should have left decades ago and replaced

64
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,520
with engaging, relevant, culturally diverse literature.

65
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,980
This individual, of course, is in the New Jersey public school system.

66
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,580
This is insidious because her language talks about replacing old books with engaging, relevant,

67
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,560
and culturally diverse literature.

68
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,740
The point being that she views these as values and that these books she's getting rid of

69
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,460
don't have those values.

70
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,460
But then what do you want to do if you want to read books that don't have those values?

71
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,000
What if you don't share her values?

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,940
Or what if you do share her values but you want to hear somebody else's opinion?

73
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,080
This is the difference between offering an alternate point of view and censoring the

74
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,260
ones you don't like.

75
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,160
If you put your contradictory ideas out there, other people can examine yours and examine

76
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,940
other people's and figure out what they want from themselves.

77
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:35,240
But if you must replace those old ideas, then you are specifically trying to force a monopoly.

78
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,200
It's fine for you to not like Andy Ngo.

79
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,440
It's fine for you not to want to read his unmasked book.

80
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,200
But should somebody be cancelled for praising it?

81
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Probably not.

82
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,920
Jordan Peterson's new book is being published by Penguin Random House, and the younger staff

83
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,960
working for that company are confronting management at a tearful town hall wanting it cancelled.

84
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,840
Several employees cried at the meeting discussing how Peterson's views have negatively impacted

85
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,920
their lives.

86
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,200
Peterson told me he's an icon of hate speech and transphobia, and the fact that he's an

87
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,880
icon of white supremacy, I'm not proud to work for a company that publishes him.

88
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,720
The book itself is actually quite tame, Jordan Peterson has never been a Nazi, and every

89
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,960
single person online who thinks so is absolutely fucking stupid.

90
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,560
There is no excuse for a grown-ass person to break down and cry because a book is being

91
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
published.

92
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,200
There was a big hullabaloo back in March about Dr. Seuss getting cancelled, remember that?

93
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,920
Those really old Dr. Seuss books that had jokes about race that aren't really in line

94
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,360
with today's progressive narrative but were completely fine for the time?

95
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,580
To the point that the cancelled books that actually held a book burning for them?

96
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:45,340
And for those people who still had copies of the books, eBay will not let you sell them

97
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,920
on its site?

98
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,580
Even though of course you can still go on eBay or Amazon for that matter and buy Mein

99
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,580
Kampf.

100
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:56,840
Forgetting of course that Dr. Seuss himself was not only a children's book author but

101
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,240
was also a political cartoonist, a progressive one at that.

102
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,080
And we cannot talk about modern book burning without talking about JK Rowling.

103
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,980
I know I'm getting on in years at this point but I wonder if some of you are old enough

104
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,680
to remember back in the late 90s and early 2000s when it was the religious right that

105
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,200
would take the Harry Potter books and burn them?

106
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,880
Because they were products of Satan, they talked about black magic and witchcraft and

107
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,680
they were turning people away from Christ.

108
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,360
The most well-documented example came out of the book A Universal History of the Destruction

109
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,980
of Books where on page 228 there is a passage dedicated to Harry Potter.

110
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,880
The crusade against Harry Potter deserves a chapter of its own but let us content ourselves

111
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,960
with just one example among many of the extremes of emotion aroused by the series.

112
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,640
On Sunday, December 30th, 2001, in Alamogordo, New Mexico, a religious community burned hundreds

113
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,960
of copies of JK Rowling's Harry Potter books.

114
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,700
Jack Brock, the leader of the Christ Community Church, explained that his intention was to

115
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,360
point out that Harry Potter was not appropriate for youngsters because it inspired them to

116
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,080
study witchcraft and magic.

117
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,880
The books are an abomination to God and to me and they are likely to destroy the lives

118
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
of many young people.

119
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,640
Of course, Brock and his flock admitted they never actually read a single Harry Potter

120
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,920
book but they did decide to toss a few Stephen King novels in the fire for good measure.

121
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,920
And I recall back in the day making fun of these people for being so stupid as to march

122
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,340
down the same path as the Nazis and burn books they didn't like.

123
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,320
But ever since 2017, well, the opposite has been happening.

124
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,080
JK Rowling, I just burned all my Harry Potter books after being a fan for 17 years.

125
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,280
The Philosopher's Stone was one of the first books I ever read.

126
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,060
I'm upset it has to be this way.

127
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,200
You embarrassed me, disgusted me, and I will never read your work again.

128
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,760
This is from a leftist.

129
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,120
The political winds have changed.

130
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,160
JK Rowling, back in 2001, was considered a radical feminist, certainly somebody on the

131
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
left.

132
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,400
And let's be honest here, she still is.

133
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,840
Leftists might not like TERFs, but TERFs are still a product of the left.

134
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,120
The right wing does not have any kind of philosophical basis from which feminism can

135
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
spring out of.

136
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,360
But as the left goes further and further left, and old leftist ideas get cast out, the same

137
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,160
progressives that loved Harry Potter 20 years ago and made it a cultural phenomenon, they're

138
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,480
now burning their books, with in fact one of the most famous TikToks of it happening

139
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,380
saying you have to stop using the death of the author as an excuse to have your cake

140
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,640
and eat it too.

141
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,680
This generally reflects the broader leftist trend in the past 20-30 years of becoming

142
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,920
more authoritarian.

143
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,040
The death of the author is a leftist idea.

144
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,620
It's basically the practice of divorcing the author from their work, so that you may be

145
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,000
able to analyze it without the specter of the author hanging over your head, so that

146
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
their intentions and their experiences and their politics don't influence your interpretation

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
of the work.

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,360
For a long time in the literary space, it was basically a way for people on the left

149
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,760
to say, this piece of literature lines up with what we're saying, so we should adopt

150
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,120
it, even if the author didn't actually go that way.

151
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,820
But the death of the author is also a great way to avoid this kind of censorship.

152
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,500
And so now that the left is on the cultural upswing again, they are abandoning the idea

153
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,160
because abandoning it allows them to burn books and censor people.

154
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,280
In 2019, feminists burned books about changing sexual orientation.

155
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,820
This is a classic now.

156
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,680
Back in 2014, feminists were burning the war against boys.

157
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,120
Chinese library officials are burning books that diverge from Communist Party ideology,

158
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,280
following in the footsteps of previous socialist regimes.

159
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,020
In Raskolnikov's letter to Stalin, he describes the widespread Soviet practice of burning

160
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,100
decadent Western books.

161
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,980
And the most famous book burners of them all, the Nazis, had a long list of books that needed

162
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,980
to be burned.

163
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,100
Works of traitors, immigrants, and authors from foreign countries who believe they can

164
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,720
attack and denigrate the new Germany.

165
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,400
The literature of Marxism, communism, and Bolshevism.

166
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,680
Pacifist literature.

167
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,760
Literature with liberal, democratic tendencies and attitudes.

168
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,280
All historic writings whose purpose it is to denigrate the origin, the spirit, and the

169
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,940
culture of the German Volk.

170
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,520
Books that advocate art which is decadent, bloodless, or purely constructivist.

171
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,960
Writings on sexuality and sexual education which serve the egocentric pleasure of the

172
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,180
individual.

173
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,840
Literature by Jewish authors, regardless of the field.

174
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,680
Popular entertainment literature that depicts life and life's goals in a superficial, unrealistic,

175
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,080
and sickly sweet manner, based on a bourgeois or upper class view of life.

176
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,160
Pornography and explicit literature.

177
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,400
All books degrading German purity.

178
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:27,320
By the way, those of you who still don't believe that Nazism is an anti-Marxist or post-Marxist

179
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,320
socialism, notice that not all socialist writers were banned, just the Marxists, the Communists,

180
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,700
and the Bolsheviks.

181
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,980
Notice that all the liberal writers were banned.

182
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:42,100
Notice that rather than appealing to tradition, writers that denigrated the new Germany were

183
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,100
banned.

184
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,220
And that writing based on a bourgeois view was banned.

185
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,800
It is a different socialism, but it is still socialism in the end.

186
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,020
And the books that the Soviets burned, and that the Chinese are burning today, are burned

187
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,820
for a very similar list of reasons.

188
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,060
All these guys, the religious people in America burning Harry Potter, the feminists burning

189
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,100
literature that goes against their ideas.

190
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,000
This is not necessarily a left or right thing, although there do seem to be more examples

191
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,660
in the left that doesn't discount the right.

192
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,240
The Taliban can be described certainly as a right-wing institution.

193
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,000
It's very religious and traditional, and they've also burned books.

194
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,200
The common thread here is authoritarianism.

195
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,740
It's the rejection of democracy, of the open society.

196
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,780
What binds all these groups together is their anti-liberalism.

197
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:30,120
There is not a single example here of a liberal burning books.

198
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,200
Cats do it.

199
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Kings do it.

200
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Emperors do it.

201
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Fuhrers do it.

202
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
And Marshals do it.

203
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,640
Even trad-caths do it.

204
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,620
It's funny to see that video from Academic Agents' recent event where they go on about

205
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,620
burning books.

206
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,960
Oh wait, I can't even show you, they fucking took it down.

207
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,820
Oh, it's down to fix the face blurring.

208
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:54,460
The point is, there is no oppressive, totalitarian, and morally reprehensible movement that has

209
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:00,100
not at one point or another directed its hatred and barbarism against books.

210
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,460
And despite the wide array of differences of all of these groups, their justification

211
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,900
is always the same.

212
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,200
The books they're burning are incorrect.

213
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,300
And there's something about the burning of books specifically.

214
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,060
Shredding them or soaking them or smashing them or any other method of destroying them

215
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,460
just doesn't compare.

216
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,500
Neither does just banning or censoring them, like not being able to sell them or having

217
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,580
them confiscated when they're caught on you.

218
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,980
Shredding is a different level.

219
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,340
A book is like a little encapsulation of human wisdom.

220
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,420
It's a window into a certain part of history.

221
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,540
So to burn any kind of book, especially one that represents culture or belief or history

222
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,900
or politics, it feels like a direct attack on man's faculty of reason.

223
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:48,220
I think Heinrich Hein said it best when he, oh, this is Kraut, this is where Kraut got

224
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,300
his avatar from, alright.

225
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,740
Heinrich Hein said it best when he said, wherever they burn books, in the end, they will also

226
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,540
burn human beings.

227
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,220
And every single group that I have talked about today has either already done that or

228
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,160
is certainly capable of doing it if they ever gain power.

229
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:11,020
The book burning in Canada is just another data point in a very long tradition of people

230
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,620
finally going mask off, finally showing themselves to be the authoritarians they are.

231
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:21,420
It would seem to me that any single person that burns a book on some level must be anti-human

232
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,420
flourishing.

233
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,220
And if that's a bit too heavy for you, I'm going to direct you over to V's channel, where

234
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,940
he talked about the same story, but with a lot more humor.

235
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,940
I'll see you next time, guys.

236
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,940
I love you.

237
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:48,260
The Blame of Purification Ceremony, as reported by the Gospel of Radio-Canada, let us pray.

238
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:54,040
In the year of the Lord 2019, by the councils called the Erie-Kathulaki province, which

239
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:01,320
oversees elementary and secondary schools in southwestern Ontario.
