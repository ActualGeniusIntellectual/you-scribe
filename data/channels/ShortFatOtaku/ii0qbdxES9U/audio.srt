1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
Canada is well known as an exceptionally polite country.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,280
So much so that we had to pass a law stating that just because we say sorry after an accident,

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,720
it can't be taken as an admission of guilt in court.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,860
Yes, that urban legend is real, it's called the Apology Act of 2009, enshrining that casually

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,120
saying sorry is an expression of empathy and nothing more.

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,200
However, the polite Canadian image is alive and well among Canadians, specifically because

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,280
we like to contrast ourselves with Americans.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,320
There's a lot of deep rooted anxiety among Canadians about being too American and trying

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,940
to carve out a uniquely Canadian identity, presumably because Canada is actually pretty

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,800
backwater all things considered, and Canadians like to pretend that we're a lot more important

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,540
on the world stage than we actually are.

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,060
This has led Canadians to adopt a thing simply because it's the opposite of Americana, including

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,640
the image of being overtly polite and humble versus the boisterous individuality of your

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,880
stereotypical American.

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,840
This has also led to a strange phenomenon where the most nationalist Canadians are left

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,520
wing, as Canada exemplifies to them the antithesis of the scary right wing American nationalism,

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,240
a topic that conservative Vancouverite JJ McCullough covered a few years ago.

18
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,800
However, not all Canadian leftists are Canadian nationalists.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,320
Some are your bog standard internationalist progressive cosmopolitan socialist type and

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,800
others are indigenous nationalists who frankly resemble other racial nationalists in their

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,000
rhetoric, but they're fully accepted on the left as revolutionary allies because they're

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,320
part of a historically oppressed racial group.

23
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,720
That's why in the past few years, the polite Canadian myth has received some pushback from

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,600
within, that the whole polite thing is just a successful spin campaign to whitewash Canada's

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,680
colonial legacy in regards to the indigenous tribes that existed here before white people

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,680
showed up.

27
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,240
And to give the devil his due, Canada's relationship with her colonial period is roughly analogous

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,280
to America's.

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,800
The initial extermination happened not due to overt warfare, but exposure to European

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,880
diseases that the natives had no immunity to, leading to a period of rapid depopulation.

31
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,960
It's not to say that the Canadians or the Americans were completely blameless.

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,320
There was also bloodshed and conflict and broken treaties and a reservation system set

33
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,640
up specifically to disenfranchise indigenous people.

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,980
With their community lacking in both technology and manpower, there was no real hope in mounting

35
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,920
any sort of resistance against colonial expansion.

36
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,920
And then, after the frontiers settle and the nation is formed, these events are forgotten

37
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
about.

38
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,760
Both America and Canada, in common history, is remembered as being simultaneously empty,

39
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,280
devoid of people, and at the same time full of friendly faces who were happily welcoming

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,940
their new white overlords.

41
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,520
Every nation has a piece of their history that they're not proud of, and this is Canada's.

42
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,240
Thankfully, we live in an era where it's no longer considered morally acceptable to conquer

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,920
other people and take their land.

44
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,080
But this is the stuff that I remember learning about in Canadian history class in school.

45
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,800
And from what I remember, it was taught pretty neutrally.

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,080
In terms of what was in the textbook, there was no the natives never existed or the natives

47
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,440
were happy to invite Europeans in, but there was also no we're all white oppressors who

48
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,780
need to atone for the sins of our ancestors either.

49
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,780
History is history.

50
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,080
We neither need to atone for it or to live by its standards.

51
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,840
In that polite Canadian article, an event is referenced from 2020 where NDP leader Jagmeet

52
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,040
Singh called a fellow member of the House of Commons a racist and was removed from the

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,640
House after refusing to apologize.

54
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,560
It should be obvious to anybody how progressives reacted to that.

55
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,840
He was considered a hero for speaking truth to power.

56
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,880
But here is the actual timeline of events.

57
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,160
The RCMP, Canada's federal level police force, was under scrutiny for accusations of systemic

58
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,160
racism.

59
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,960
The House of Commons was moving to set up a committee to investigate those claims.

60
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,440
During the session where the details of such a committee were being ironed out, Singh used

61
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,020
his time to ask the House of Commons to recognize that there is indeed systemic racism within

62
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,920
the RCMP and therefore review their budget, implement additional oversight and boost funding

63
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,600
to mental health and addiction support.

64
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
Do you see the problem here?

65
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,640
Realize how you feel about those proposals, I mean.

66
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,280
The House of Commons was discussing the formation of a committee to investigate the claim of

67
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,400
systemic racism within the RCMP and Singh's demand assumed that the systemic racism already

68
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
existed.

69
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,640
The Quebec separatist faction of the House declined to support Singh's motion because

70
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,360
they believed that it would render the committee unable to impartially investigate the possibility

71
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,840
of systemic racism within the RCMP as the motion assumed that it existed before the

72
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,040
committee even began its work.

73
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,120
In response, Singh called the currently speaking MP opposing him a racist, and he refused to

74
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
apologize later.

75
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,200
His opponents simply wanted a real, impartial investigation.

76
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,780
But if you don't automatically assume racism, you're a racist.

77
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:25,300
And of this event, that polite Canadian article says, quoting professor Julie Rak at the University

78
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:31,040
of Alberta's English and Film Studies departments, who focuses on life writing, book history,

79
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,000
online identity construction, gender and sexual theory, cultural materialist theory, Inuit

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,600
writing, mountaineering writing, and autobiographical comics, it gets to the heart of what niceness

81
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,720
or politeness actually represents.

82
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,280
Canadian niceness, you can really equate with Canadian whiteness, and you can really equate

83
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,240
that with Canadian Britishness.

84
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,720
Far from being just an innate virtue, politeness has a history.

85
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,680
Being polite is about power.

86
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,180
It's a response to something that may not address the problem.

87
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,000
It's not that we need to be rude, but politeness papers over or ignores the real situation.

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,920
There's just too much here to go into for this video.

89
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,840
I'll save for the future when I inevitably do the civility politics video.

90
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,240
What I'm getting at is there's a view among some Canadian progressives that Canadian politeness

91
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,920
is simply being mask on and that Canada is founded on the same settler colonialism that

92
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
America is.

93
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,180
All right, considering our history, I can see that point of view.

94
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,580
But in Canada, they're taking it a step further right now.

95
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:29,120
There is a prevailing view here that right now, there's an ongoing genocide of indigenous

96
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,860
people because Canada has a definition of genocide that nobody else uses, which basically

97
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,300
amounts to if there is any systemic racism or oppression, it's a genocide.

98
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,260
I hope I don't have to say this, but this is a ridiculous view.

99
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,140
Even if there is systemic racism, that doesn't mean there's genocide.

100
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,140
Things can be bad.

101
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,980
They can even be really bad without being the worst thing ever at all times.

102
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,500
By the way, this is also why there isn't a trans genocide right now either.

103
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,340
So that's the progressive who thinks that Canadian politeness is a mask hiding our evil

104
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,380
racist ways.

105
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,700
However, there is a separate group of progressives who think that Canadian politeness is not

106
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,700
a mask.

107
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,700
It's real.

108
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,580
At the same time, we are also evil and racist anyway.

109
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,500
This group believes in the whole indigenous genocide thing too, but channels that Canadian

110
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,740
politeness into a form of public self-flagellation over the guilt of it all.

111
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,440
That yes, we are all guilty of not only the past, but the totally real genocide happening

112
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,960
right now, simply by virtue of being white settler Canadians.

113
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,500
If you want to see this point of view in action, watch any sort of Canadian official press

114
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,520
conference or political debate or speech at a university.

115
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,660
It's become trendy to apologize to the native tribe the land that the venue is on was stolen

116
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,660
from.

117
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,380
Hello everyone, bienvenue.

118
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,340
I would like to begin today by acknowledging that we are in the unceded and unsurrendered

119
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,940
territory of the Algonquin Anishinabek nation.

120
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,020
I am honored to be here and would like to remind those of us who are settlers of our

121
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:57,500
great responsibility towards justice and especially in a country that is still perpetuating ongoing

122
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
genocide.

123
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:05,460
Today, I am here for the occasion of the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Intersexism

124
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,680
and Transphobia.

125
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,520
This week is very special to me.

126
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,100
I am celebrating my one year on hormone replacement therapy and 13 months after I had my chest

127
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,100
surgery.

128
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,460
There was a controversy back in 2019 where the CBC, Canada's state-funded news outlet,

129
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,540
posted an article titled, Dear White People, where the indigenous author was a raging racist.

130
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,420
An investigation into the article led to this justification.

131
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,540
It is important to note that the complainant and Ms. Inutik have very different interpretations

132
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,600
of the word racist.

133
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,780
The complainant appears to see it through the lens of individuals beliefs or actions

134
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,300
in which racism is doing something which might signify prejudice, hatred or intolerance.

135
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,580
Ms. Inutik sees racism as a system of oppression in which one culture has been dominant while

136
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,060
another is disadvantaged.

137
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,420
It is historic and seeps into almost every aspect of life.

138
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,300
Through that lens, it is understandable that she would write that racism against white

139
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,980
people does not exist or all white people are racist to some degree because they are

140
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,060
born and raised in a system made by white people for white people.

141
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,700
It also offers some insight into why her column might be acceptable when a column titled Dear

142
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,700
Black People would almost certainly not be.

143
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,460
I will not even try to bridge the divide between these two ways of defining racism.

144
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,900
However, I must say that in Canadian society, it is unreasonable to equate the impact of

145
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,340
a column criticizing white people versus a column criticizing indigenous people or any

146
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,540
other group which has historically been marginalized.

147
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,180
In other words, the CBC is not going to try to make anybody understand, they're just

148
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,940
going to accept the view that all racism is systemic and therefore all white people

149
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,260
are oppressors because debating it is problematic.

150
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,580
And in 2020, people shrieked their head off after a native woman answered the door while

151
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,020
stoned off her ass.

152
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,660
Notice that the cops were on her porch, attacked the cops and was shot dead in self-defense

153
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,660
by them.

154
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,940
The cops were accused of racism and the entire police force was systematically racist and

155
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,900
Canada was a settler colonial system designed to destroy non-white people and does any of

156
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,220
this sound kind of familiar to you, Americans?

157
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,540
Meanwhile, that very same settler colonial system set up to only benefit white people

158
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,340
has these incredible educational slides meant for government employees to view.

159
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:08,820
White supremacy culture is such negative qualities as a sense of urgency, defensiveness, worship

160
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,020
of the written word, fear of open conflict, individualism, objectivity.

161
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,360
At the same time, there's socially acceptable covert white supremacy like not challenging

162
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,180
a racist joke or claiming reverse racism or bootstrap theory or belief in a post-racial

163
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,780
society or colorblindness or wait, wait, wait, that word colorblindness, that's spelled

164
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,780
the American way.

165
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,740
They didn't even get a Canadian to make this fucking thing.

166
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,780
They just took whatever was floating around on Tumblr, didn't they?

167
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,340
This story here was a big deal too.

168
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,000
The police were refusing to remove indigenous lobster traps.

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,180
So non-indigenous sailors were doing it themselves because they were operating out of season

170
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,180
without a license.

171
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,220
And it turns out once the authorities finally investigated, they discovered that these operations

172
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,180
were actually harming the local ecosystem by overwhelmingly targeting undersized lobsters

173
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,200
before they had a chance to grow and reproduce.

174
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,420
The first nation doing this sort of thing claims to have a treaty with the feds to be

175
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,460
able to fish as much as they want at any time.

176
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,700
The jury is still out in that claim.

177
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,820
But even if true, how much do you expect them to rely on worship of the written word now

178
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,700
that it would be in their favor despite the damage that it's causing?

179
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,580
But by far the most publicized event of this type, at least domestically here in Canada,

180
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,580
are the oil pipeline disputes where companies want to build pipelines from the Pacific Coast

181
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,900
and BC across the Rocky Mountains to the oil fields in Alberta.

182
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,160
It cuts through the traditional lands of several indigenous peoples and they're all up and

183
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,140
arms about it.

184
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,160
The government has included them on the project, hearing their concerns about environmental

185
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,880
impacts and they've taken extra safety precautions to try to meet the demands.

186
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,080
Some of the concerns are not environmental in nature, but they're economic.

187
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,420
Some groups simply wanted a piece of pie in exchange and hey, fair enough.

188
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,760
If there's one surefire way to raise a community out of poverty, it's access to jobs and development.

189
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,300
But for some groups, it wasn't economic concerns or environmental ones, but rather sovereignty.

190
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,720
In Canada, we've got the ban system set up by the awkwardly named Indian Act.

191
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,120
The TLDR is that each First Nation is democratically represented by a banned council which is headed

192
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,820
up by an elected chief.

193
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,320
Sometimes the ban represents a reservation and its people, sometimes several reservations,

194
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,380
and sometimes just a group of people who don't live on an official reserve.

195
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,080
But there are some indigenous groups who wholly reject the ban and reserve system, instead

196
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,040
opting to follow hereditary chiefs descended from historic leaders pre-European contact.

197
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,560
To them, the ban system, despite being rooted in democracy, is just a tool of white colonialism.

198
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,200
And their semi-tribal, semi-feudal hereditary system of government is the one with real legitimacy.

199
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,700
This is where we get to the Shuswap people, one of the groups who claim land right in

200
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,240
the way of pipeline construction.

201
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,040
A splinter group of theirs, calling themselves land defenders and later more formally, the

202
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,600
tiny house warriors, claim to get their legitimacy from the Okanagan-Shuswap confederacy, that

203
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,800
the elected ban representatives only have jurisdiction because Canada says they do,

204
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,440
and that their traditional matriarchal hereditary leadership still claims all of Shuswap territory,

205
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,240
standing far beyond the reserve system.

206
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,360
Oh, and for all of the broader left's claim to really hate blood and soil rhetoric, and

207
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,040
to love democracy so much that it must be forced into the workplace, in the end they're

208
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,840
100% okay with siding with a racial monarchy that claims a spiritual connection to the

209
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,560
land based on their ethnicity, as long as there's feathers in the crown.

210
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,200
And at the exact same time as protesters were getting arrested in the way of pipeline construction,

211
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,840
truckers are getting arrested in Ottawa, yes that video is still coming.

212
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,560
You don't even need me to say it, you already know that the progressives were talking out

213
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,320
of both sides of their mouth when it came to how good or evil the cops are.

214
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,000
All of this culminated in the historic cancelling of Canada Day in 2021, where instead of celebrating

215
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,760
our country, we were told to be solemn and reflect on atrocities and understand our white

216
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,720
privilege, and that if we were good people, we would wear orange in solidarity with indigenous

217
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,240
survivors of the residential school system.

218
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,720
Wait a minute, that's not a historic cancelling, they've been calling for that every Canada

219
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,760
Day since Canada's 150th birthday back in 2017, that's an event I also did a video

220
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,280
on way back when.

221
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,880
Orange has since become an activist colour here in Canada for anything First Nations

222
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,440
related, from the aforementioned residential school system, to missing indigenous prostitutes,

223
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,960
to the pipeline stuff, to the land treaties and the hunting and fishing rights, to anything

224
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,120
else that could be considered racist or colonial.

225
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,100
The residential school system, by the way, was a series of Catholic run government funded

226
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,020
schools specifically designed for indigenous children.

227
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:05,200
Early in their history, they were noteworthy for being a component of the actual genocide

228
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,840
that took place, where the RCMP stole children from their parents to be culturally re-educated

229
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
to be Western.

230
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,080
A lot of real physical and sexual abuse happened at these schools, and they are considered

231
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,040
one of those legitimately dark spots in Canadian history, causing a lot of intergenerational

232
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,840
physical abuse, PTSD, substance abuse, and suicide among Canada's indigenous population.

233
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,060
The final school closed in 1997, and the remaining survivors of the system received both an official

234
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,860
apology from the government as well as financial compensation.

235
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,960
That being said, the residential school system first kicked into gear in 1894, and the vast

236
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,920
majority of the abuse happened earlier in the system's life rather than later.

237
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,320
A number of reforms, most notably in 1969, changed how the residential schools operated,

238
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,760
and by the time the final ones were closing their doors, the schools had reformed to the

239
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,800
point they were actually decent institutions, and there was even some resistance by the

240
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,440
indigenous students served by them.

241
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,960
But in the end, the historical stain was too great.

242
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,480
Mention the phrase at residential school to a Canadian, and you'll hear more sorrys than

243
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,620
you ever thought possible, even from us.

244
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:08,540
Something came to a head when, last year, there was a widely publicized mass grave site

245
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,060
found at one of these residential schools.

246
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,620
I even did a video on it myself, reporting on the information available at the time,

247
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,260
and there's a lot more information available now, one year on.

248
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,740
The newly publicized existence of this mass grave site brought that Canadian shame and

249
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,420
self-flagellation back to the forefront once again.

250
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,660
Everybody was wearing orange and talking about how awful Canada is and how white settlers

251
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,380
should be ashamed and need to gracefully bow and step back and castrate themselves in the

252
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,380
name of diversity.

253
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,820
Everyone was tripping all over themselves as to how badly they felt about it.

254
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,700
The only problem is, it's not true.

255
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,540
It's been a year now, and not a single body has been found.

256
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,100
A professor of history at the University of Montreal, with a French name that I can't

257
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,620
pronounce, published this article.

258
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,440
In Kamloops, not one body has been found.

259
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,740
He examined all of the data publicly available from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,

260
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,740
the body meant to investigate the truth of the residential schools, where it compiled

261
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,860
all government records, all school records, all band records, and all church records,

262
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,860
and made them public.

263
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,140
And he found it was all just a bunch of bullshit.

264
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:06,460
Last year's news story broke because an anthropologist, Sarah Bouillot, used a new ground-penetrating

265
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,220
radar technology on a location suspected to be a mass gravesite.

266
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,860
And her preliminary report did identify abnormalities in the soil that could be bodies, but also

267
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,260
could be tree roots in the soil of an apple orchard on the old school grounds.

268
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,500
There has, as of yet, been no exhumation of any potential bodies at the site.

269
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,020
And Bouillot said specifically the only way to know is to exhume them because this technology

270
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,940
is not enough to determine what's actually down there.

271
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,380
But despite this, and despite the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's conclusion that

272
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,040
there was cultural genocide only and not physical genocide at these schools, the media reported

273
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,560
on the ground-penetrating radar as if it were the smoking gun necessary to condemn all white

274
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,860
Canadians for a crime that happened 100 years ago.

275
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,100
Meanwhile, official records show that 49 students at the Kamloops Residential School died from

276
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,780
1915 to 1964.

277
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,420
Seventeen of them died in a hospital, eight of them on their own reservations as a result

278
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,420
of illness or accidents, four had autopsies, seven had coroner inquests, 24 were buried

279
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,700
at their home reserves cemetery, and only four were buried at the school.

280
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,180
This doesn't sound like a genocidal regime covering up the deaths of children and hiding

281
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,940
them from their parents and dumping the bodies into a big hole in the ground.

282
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,060
A big hole, keep in mind, that would have been dug on the Kamloops reservation as that's

283
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,500
where the school was, right beside the school's actual cemetery.

284
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,140
The chief of the Kamloops reservation stated publicly that the children's remains were

285
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:26,360
known about in the community to reside in the school's cemetery this whole time.

286
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,400
In my opinion, the reason the band hasn't moved forward with further investigations

287
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,140
is because there's probably no mass grave and now that the spotlight has moved away

288
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,400
from them, they're hoping to just let the topic die.

289
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,880
Other mass grave claims are turning out to be something similar.

290
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,600
On the Cowessess reservation, the claim was made of a mass grave site of 750 people, but

291
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,960
it turned out it was just a derelict cemetery where the crosses marking the graves were

292
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,480
made out of wood and the community had failed to maintain it.

293
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,140
The same thing happened to the residential school near Mission, British Columbia.

294
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,400
The cemetery was left unattended after the school closed in 1914 and was subsequently

295
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,000
overrun with stray cattle.

296
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,180
The Cooper Island school was claimed to have 160 undocumented and unmarked graves by the

297
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,740
Penelakut First Nation.

298
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,740
And um, that's it.

299
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,380
They didn't reveal how they knew about it, they didn't provide any details or records

300
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,420
or stories or evidence, and they stopped talking to all media after making the claim.

301
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,780
182 bodies were found at the Kootenai residential school, but it too was a derelict cemetery,

302
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,340
with a former chief saying, there's no discovery, we knew it was there, it's a graveyard.

303
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,140
The fact there are graves inside a graveyard shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.

304
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,460
It's almost like there's this expectation that indigenous people would have been immortal

305
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,920
had the white man not come along and killed them or something.

306
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,780
A grave with a POC in it isn't automatically a white person's fault.

307
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,260
Now if you want to know the true origins of this mass graves hoax, that is too deep of

308
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,100
a rabbit hole for me to go down, you can go join Lauren Southern as she digs deep into

309
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,220
the psychosis of a white guilt ridden native activist over on her channel.

310
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,100
The TLDR is that this guy is crazy and made it all up, and it went viral hard enough and

311
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,540
was repeated through enough credible outlets that people just now take it as fact, even

312
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,780
though there's no evidence.

313
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,660
That's not my primary purpose in talking about this stuff.

314
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,340
I like Canada, it's an alright place.

315
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,100
Yeah, there's some dark spots in our history, but that's how it is for everybody, that's

316
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,200
not unique to us.

317
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,700
I don't want to take responsibility for something that I didn't do, or at least something that

318
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,940
the white part of me didn't do, and if that's individualistic and therefore white supremacy,

319
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,940
I don't care anymore.

320
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,060
You'd have to be exceptionally stupid to consider individual responsibility a white only trait.

321
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,600
I don't infantilize all non-white people like that.

322
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,480
But I think, most importantly of all, I'm just done with the imposed guilt of it.

323
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,880
I'm not guilty of anything just because I'm white, or to some people, I'm white passing,

324
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,560
and I'm tired of pretending like I am.

325
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,960
I'm tired of the social expectation that I apologize because of the actions of people

326
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,220
who look like me, who did what they did before I was even born.

327
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,560
I'm tired of the quasi-neo-fascist, land-back bullshit, while at the same time they call

328
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,400
all white people Nazis.

329
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,160
I'm tired of people screaming settler colonialism, like the quality of life here isn't actually

330
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,320
pretty fucking good.

331
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,840
Despite the myriad of problems that Canada faces, don't worry, I know all about them,

332
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,760
this is still a great place, all things considered, we're still a liberal democracy despite the

333
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
threats that we face.

334
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,440
In other words, Canada good, simple as.

335
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,160
And I'm not going to boycott Canada Day, or wear orange, or feel bad about thinking well

336
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
of my home anymore.
