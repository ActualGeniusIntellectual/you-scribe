00:00.000 --> 00:08.720
Canada is well known as an exceptionally polite country.

00:08.720 --> 00:13.280
So much so that we had to pass a law stating that just because we say sorry after an accident,

00:13.280 --> 00:15.720
it can't be taken as an admission of guilt in court.

00:15.720 --> 00:20.860
Yes, that urban legend is real, it's called the Apology Act of 2009, enshrining that casually

00:20.860 --> 00:24.120
saying sorry is an expression of empathy and nothing more.

00:24.120 --> 00:28.200
However, the polite Canadian image is alive and well among Canadians, specifically because

00:28.200 --> 00:30.280
we like to contrast ourselves with Americans.

00:30.280 --> 00:34.320
There's a lot of deep rooted anxiety among Canadians about being too American and trying

00:34.320 --> 00:37.940
to carve out a uniquely Canadian identity, presumably because Canada is actually pretty

00:37.940 --> 00:41.800
backwater all things considered, and Canadians like to pretend that we're a lot more important

00:41.800 --> 00:43.540
on the world stage than we actually are.

00:43.540 --> 00:48.060
This has led Canadians to adopt a thing simply because it's the opposite of Americana, including

00:48.060 --> 00:52.640
the image of being overtly polite and humble versus the boisterous individuality of your

00:52.640 --> 00:53.880
stereotypical American.

00:53.880 --> 00:57.840
This has also led to a strange phenomenon where the most nationalist Canadians are left

00:57.840 --> 01:03.520
wing, as Canada exemplifies to them the antithesis of the scary right wing American nationalism,

01:03.520 --> 01:07.240
a topic that conservative Vancouverite JJ McCullough covered a few years ago.

01:07.240 --> 01:10.800
However, not all Canadian leftists are Canadian nationalists.

01:10.800 --> 01:15.320
Some are your bog standard internationalist progressive cosmopolitan socialist type and

01:15.320 --> 01:20.800
others are indigenous nationalists who frankly resemble other racial nationalists in their

01:20.800 --> 01:25.000
rhetoric, but they're fully accepted on the left as revolutionary allies because they're

01:25.000 --> 01:27.320
part of a historically oppressed racial group.

01:27.320 --> 01:31.720
That's why in the past few years, the polite Canadian myth has received some pushback from

01:31.720 --> 01:36.600
within, that the whole polite thing is just a successful spin campaign to whitewash Canada's

01:36.600 --> 01:40.680
colonial legacy in regards to the indigenous tribes that existed here before white people

01:40.680 --> 01:41.680
showed up.

01:41.680 --> 01:46.240
And to give the devil his due, Canada's relationship with her colonial period is roughly analogous

01:46.240 --> 01:47.280
to America's.

01:47.280 --> 01:51.800
The initial extermination happened not due to overt warfare, but exposure to European

01:51.800 --> 01:55.880
diseases that the natives had no immunity to, leading to a period of rapid depopulation.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.960
It's not to say that the Canadians or the Americans were completely blameless.

01:58.960 --> 02:03.320
There was also bloodshed and conflict and broken treaties and a reservation system set

02:03.320 --> 02:05.640
up specifically to disenfranchise indigenous people.

02:05.640 --> 02:09.980
With their community lacking in both technology and manpower, there was no real hope in mounting

02:09.980 --> 02:12.920
any sort of resistance against colonial expansion.

02:12.920 --> 02:16.920
And then, after the frontiers settle and the nation is formed, these events are forgotten

02:16.920 --> 02:17.920
about.

02:17.920 --> 02:22.760
Both America and Canada, in common history, is remembered as being simultaneously empty,

02:22.760 --> 02:27.280
devoid of people, and at the same time full of friendly faces who were happily welcoming

02:27.280 --> 02:28.940
their new white overlords.

02:28.940 --> 02:32.520
Every nation has a piece of their history that they're not proud of, and this is Canada's.

02:32.520 --> 02:36.240
Thankfully, we live in an era where it's no longer considered morally acceptable to conquer

02:36.240 --> 02:37.920
other people and take their land.

02:37.920 --> 02:41.080
But this is the stuff that I remember learning about in Canadian history class in school.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.800
And from what I remember, it was taught pretty neutrally.

02:42.800 --> 02:47.080
In terms of what was in the textbook, there was no the natives never existed or the natives

02:47.080 --> 02:51.440
were happy to invite Europeans in, but there was also no we're all white oppressors who

02:51.440 --> 02:53.780
need to atone for the sins of our ancestors either.

02:53.780 --> 02:54.780
History is history.

02:54.780 --> 02:58.080
We neither need to atone for it or to live by its standards.

02:58.080 --> 03:02.840
In that polite Canadian article, an event is referenced from 2020 where NDP leader Jagmeet

03:02.840 --> 03:07.040
Singh called a fellow member of the House of Commons a racist and was removed from the

03:07.040 --> 03:08.640
House after refusing to apologize.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.560
It should be obvious to anybody how progressives reacted to that.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.840
He was considered a hero for speaking truth to power.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.880
But here is the actual timeline of events.

03:15.880 --> 03:21.160
The RCMP, Canada's federal level police force, was under scrutiny for accusations of systemic

03:21.160 --> 03:22.160
racism.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.960
The House of Commons was moving to set up a committee to investigate those claims.

03:25.960 --> 03:29.440
During the session where the details of such a committee were being ironed out, Singh used

03:29.440 --> 03:34.020
his time to ask the House of Commons to recognize that there is indeed systemic racism within

03:34.020 --> 03:38.920
the RCMP and therefore review their budget, implement additional oversight and boost funding

03:38.920 --> 03:40.600
to mental health and addiction support.

03:40.640 --> 03:41.640
Do you see the problem here?

03:41.640 --> 03:43.640
Realize how you feel about those proposals, I mean.

03:43.640 --> 03:47.280
The House of Commons was discussing the formation of a committee to investigate the claim of

03:47.280 --> 03:52.400
systemic racism within the RCMP and Singh's demand assumed that the systemic racism already

03:52.400 --> 03:53.400
existed.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.640
The Quebec separatist faction of the House declined to support Singh's motion because

03:56.640 --> 04:01.360
they believed that it would render the committee unable to impartially investigate the possibility

04:01.360 --> 04:05.840
of systemic racism within the RCMP as the motion assumed that it existed before the

04:05.840 --> 04:07.040
committee even began its work.

04:07.480 --> 04:12.120
In response, Singh called the currently speaking MP opposing him a racist, and he refused to

04:12.120 --> 04:13.120
apologize later.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.200
His opponents simply wanted a real, impartial investigation.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.780
But if you don't automatically assume racism, you're a racist.

04:19.780 --> 04:25.300
And of this event, that polite Canadian article says, quoting professor Julie Rak at the University

04:25.300 --> 04:31.040
of Alberta's English and Film Studies departments, who focuses on life writing, book history,

04:31.040 --> 04:36.000
online identity construction, gender and sexual theory, cultural materialist theory, Inuit

04:36.000 --> 04:41.600
writing, mountaineering writing, and autobiographical comics, it gets to the heart of what niceness

04:41.600 --> 04:43.720
or politeness actually represents.

04:43.720 --> 04:48.280
Canadian niceness, you can really equate with Canadian whiteness, and you can really equate

04:48.280 --> 04:50.240
that with Canadian Britishness.

04:50.240 --> 04:53.720
Far from being just an innate virtue, politeness has a history.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.680
Being polite is about power.

04:55.680 --> 04:58.180
It's a response to something that may not address the problem.

04:58.180 --> 05:03.000
It's not that we need to be rude, but politeness papers over or ignores the real situation.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.920
There's just too much here to go into for this video.

05:04.920 --> 05:07.840
I'll save for the future when I inevitably do the civility politics video.

05:07.840 --> 05:12.240
What I'm getting at is there's a view among some Canadian progressives that Canadian politeness

05:12.240 --> 05:16.920
is simply being mask on and that Canada is founded on the same settler colonialism that

05:16.920 --> 05:17.920
America is.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.180
All right, considering our history, I can see that point of view.

05:21.180 --> 05:23.580
But in Canada, they're taking it a step further right now.

05:23.580 --> 05:29.120
There is a prevailing view here that right now, there's an ongoing genocide of indigenous

05:29.120 --> 05:33.860
people because Canada has a definition of genocide that nobody else uses, which basically

05:33.860 --> 05:38.300
amounts to if there is any systemic racism or oppression, it's a genocide.

05:38.300 --> 05:42.260
I hope I don't have to say this, but this is a ridiculous view.

05:42.260 --> 05:45.140
Even if there is systemic racism, that doesn't mean there's genocide.

05:45.140 --> 05:46.140
Things can be bad.

05:46.140 --> 05:49.980
They can even be really bad without being the worst thing ever at all times.

05:49.980 --> 05:53.500
By the way, this is also why there isn't a trans genocide right now either.

05:53.500 --> 05:57.340
So that's the progressive who thinks that Canadian politeness is a mask hiding our evil

05:57.340 --> 05:58.380
racist ways.

05:58.380 --> 06:01.700
However, there is a separate group of progressives who think that Canadian politeness is not

06:01.700 --> 06:02.700
a mask.

06:02.700 --> 06:03.700
It's real.

06:03.700 --> 06:06.580
At the same time, we are also evil and racist anyway.

06:06.580 --> 06:10.500
This group believes in the whole indigenous genocide thing too, but channels that Canadian

06:10.500 --> 06:14.740
politeness into a form of public self-flagellation over the guilt of it all.

06:14.740 --> 06:18.440
That yes, we are all guilty of not only the past, but the totally real genocide happening

06:18.440 --> 06:21.960
right now, simply by virtue of being white settler Canadians.

06:21.960 --> 06:25.500
If you want to see this point of view in action, watch any sort of Canadian official press

06:25.500 --> 06:28.520
conference or political debate or speech at a university.

06:28.520 --> 06:32.660
It's become trendy to apologize to the native tribe the land that the venue is on was stolen

06:32.660 --> 06:33.660
from.

06:33.660 --> 06:37.380
Hello everyone, bienvenue.

06:37.380 --> 06:41.340
I would like to begin today by acknowledging that we are in the unceded and unsurrendered

06:41.340 --> 06:44.940
territory of the Algonquin Anishinabek nation.

06:44.940 --> 06:50.020
I am honored to be here and would like to remind those of us who are settlers of our

06:50.020 --> 06:57.500
great responsibility towards justice and especially in a country that is still perpetuating ongoing

06:57.500 --> 06:58.500
genocide.

06:58.500 --> 07:05.460
Today, I am here for the occasion of the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Intersexism

07:05.460 --> 07:07.680
and Transphobia.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.520
This week is very special to me.

07:09.520 --> 07:15.100
I am celebrating my one year on hormone replacement therapy and 13 months after I had my chest

07:15.100 --> 07:16.100
surgery.

07:16.100 --> 07:20.460
There was a controversy back in 2019 where the CBC, Canada's state-funded news outlet,

07:20.460 --> 07:25.540
posted an article titled, Dear White People, where the indigenous author was a raging racist.

07:25.540 --> 07:28.420
An investigation into the article led to this justification.

07:28.420 --> 07:32.540
It is important to note that the complainant and Ms. Inutik have very different interpretations

07:32.540 --> 07:33.600
of the word racist.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.780
The complainant appears to see it through the lens of individuals beliefs or actions

07:36.780 --> 07:41.300
in which racism is doing something which might signify prejudice, hatred or intolerance.

07:41.300 --> 07:45.580
Ms. Inutik sees racism as a system of oppression in which one culture has been dominant while

07:45.580 --> 07:47.060
another is disadvantaged.

07:47.060 --> 07:50.420
It is historic and seeps into almost every aspect of life.

07:50.420 --> 07:54.300
Through that lens, it is understandable that she would write that racism against white

07:54.300 --> 07:57.980
people does not exist or all white people are racist to some degree because they are

07:57.980 --> 08:01.060
born and raised in a system made by white people for white people.

08:01.060 --> 08:05.700
It also offers some insight into why her column might be acceptable when a column titled Dear

08:05.700 --> 08:07.700
Black People would almost certainly not be.

08:07.700 --> 08:11.460
I will not even try to bridge the divide between these two ways of defining racism.

08:11.460 --> 08:15.900
However, I must say that in Canadian society, it is unreasonable to equate the impact of

08:15.900 --> 08:20.340
a column criticizing white people versus a column criticizing indigenous people or any

08:20.340 --> 08:22.540
other group which has historically been marginalized.

08:22.540 --> 08:26.180
In other words, the CBC is not going to try to make anybody understand, they're just

08:26.180 --> 08:29.940
going to accept the view that all racism is systemic and therefore all white people

08:29.940 --> 08:32.260
are oppressors because debating it is problematic.

08:32.260 --> 08:36.580
And in 2020, people shrieked their head off after a native woman answered the door while

08:36.580 --> 08:38.020
stoned off her ass.

08:38.020 --> 08:42.660
Notice that the cops were on her porch, attacked the cops and was shot dead in self-defense

08:42.660 --> 08:43.660
by them.

08:43.660 --> 08:47.940
The cops were accused of racism and the entire police force was systematically racist and

08:47.940 --> 08:51.900
Canada was a settler colonial system designed to destroy non-white people and does any of

08:51.900 --> 08:54.220
this sound kind of familiar to you, Americans?

08:54.260 --> 08:58.540
Meanwhile, that very same settler colonial system set up to only benefit white people

08:58.540 --> 09:03.340
has these incredible educational slides meant for government employees to view.

09:03.340 --> 09:08.820
White supremacy culture is such negative qualities as a sense of urgency, defensiveness, worship

09:08.820 --> 09:13.020
of the written word, fear of open conflict, individualism, objectivity.

09:13.020 --> 09:17.360
At the same time, there's socially acceptable covert white supremacy like not challenging

09:17.360 --> 09:22.180
a racist joke or claiming reverse racism or bootstrap theory or belief in a post-racial

09:22.180 --> 09:26.780
society or colorblindness or wait, wait, wait, that word colorblindness, that's spelled

09:26.780 --> 09:27.780
the American way.

09:27.780 --> 09:30.740
They didn't even get a Canadian to make this fucking thing.

09:30.740 --> 09:32.780
They just took whatever was floating around on Tumblr, didn't they?

09:32.780 --> 09:34.340
This story here was a big deal too.

09:34.340 --> 09:37.000
The police were refusing to remove indigenous lobster traps.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.180
So non-indigenous sailors were doing it themselves because they were operating out of season

09:41.180 --> 09:42.180
without a license.

09:42.180 --> 09:46.220
And it turns out once the authorities finally investigated, they discovered that these operations

09:46.220 --> 09:51.180
were actually harming the local ecosystem by overwhelmingly targeting undersized lobsters

09:51.180 --> 09:53.200
before they had a chance to grow and reproduce.

09:53.200 --> 09:56.420
The first nation doing this sort of thing claims to have a treaty with the feds to be

09:56.420 --> 09:58.460
able to fish as much as they want at any time.

09:58.460 --> 09:59.700
The jury is still out in that claim.

09:59.700 --> 10:03.820
But even if true, how much do you expect them to rely on worship of the written word now

10:03.820 --> 10:06.700
that it would be in their favor despite the damage that it's causing?

10:06.700 --> 10:10.580
But by far the most publicized event of this type, at least domestically here in Canada,

10:10.580 --> 10:14.580
are the oil pipeline disputes where companies want to build pipelines from the Pacific Coast

10:14.580 --> 10:17.900
and BC across the Rocky Mountains to the oil fields in Alberta.

10:17.900 --> 10:21.160
It cuts through the traditional lands of several indigenous peoples and they're all up and

10:21.160 --> 10:22.140
arms about it.

10:22.140 --> 10:25.160
The government has included them on the project, hearing their concerns about environmental

10:25.160 --> 10:28.880
impacts and they've taken extra safety precautions to try to meet the demands.

10:28.880 --> 10:32.080
Some of the concerns are not environmental in nature, but they're economic.

10:32.080 --> 10:35.420
Some groups simply wanted a piece of pie in exchange and hey, fair enough.

10:35.420 --> 10:39.760
If there's one surefire way to raise a community out of poverty, it's access to jobs and development.

10:39.760 --> 10:44.300
But for some groups, it wasn't economic concerns or environmental ones, but rather sovereignty.

10:44.300 --> 10:48.720
In Canada, we've got the ban system set up by the awkwardly named Indian Act.

10:48.720 --> 10:53.120
The TLDR is that each First Nation is democratically represented by a banned council which is headed

10:53.120 --> 10:54.820
up by an elected chief.

10:54.820 --> 10:58.320
Sometimes the ban represents a reservation and its people, sometimes several reservations,

10:58.320 --> 11:01.380
and sometimes just a group of people who don't live on an official reserve.

11:01.380 --> 11:06.080
But there are some indigenous groups who wholly reject the ban and reserve system, instead

11:06.080 --> 11:11.040
opting to follow hereditary chiefs descended from historic leaders pre-European contact.

11:11.040 --> 11:16.560
To them, the ban system, despite being rooted in democracy, is just a tool of white colonialism.

11:16.560 --> 11:21.200
And their semi-tribal, semi-feudal hereditary system of government is the one with real legitimacy.

11:21.200 --> 11:24.700
This is where we get to the Shuswap people, one of the groups who claim land right in

11:24.700 --> 11:26.240
the way of pipeline construction.

11:26.240 --> 11:30.040
A splinter group of theirs, calling themselves land defenders and later more formally, the

11:30.040 --> 11:35.600
tiny house warriors, claim to get their legitimacy from the Okanagan-Shuswap confederacy, that

11:35.600 --> 11:39.800
the elected ban representatives only have jurisdiction because Canada says they do,

11:39.800 --> 11:45.440
and that their traditional matriarchal hereditary leadership still claims all of Shuswap territory,

11:45.440 --> 11:47.240
standing far beyond the reserve system.

11:47.240 --> 11:51.360
Oh, and for all of the broader left's claim to really hate blood and soil rhetoric, and

11:51.360 --> 11:56.040
to love democracy so much that it must be forced into the workplace, in the end they're

11:56.040 --> 12:00.840
100% okay with siding with a racial monarchy that claims a spiritual connection to the

12:00.840 --> 12:04.560
land based on their ethnicity, as long as there's feathers in the crown.

12:04.560 --> 12:08.200
And at the exact same time as protesters were getting arrested in the way of pipeline construction,

12:08.200 --> 12:10.840
truckers are getting arrested in Ottawa, yes that video is still coming.

12:10.840 --> 12:14.560
You don't even need me to say it, you already know that the progressives were talking out

12:14.560 --> 12:18.320
of both sides of their mouth when it came to how good or evil the cops are.

12:18.320 --> 12:23.000
All of this culminated in the historic cancelling of Canada Day in 2021, where instead of celebrating

12:23.000 --> 12:26.760
our country, we were told to be solemn and reflect on atrocities and understand our white

12:26.760 --> 12:30.720
privilege, and that if we were good people, we would wear orange in solidarity with indigenous

12:30.720 --> 12:32.240
survivors of the residential school system.

12:32.240 --> 12:35.720
Wait a minute, that's not a historic cancelling, they've been calling for that every Canada

12:35.720 --> 12:39.760
Day since Canada's 150th birthday back in 2017, that's an event I also did a video

12:39.760 --> 12:41.280
on way back when.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.880
Orange has since become an activist colour here in Canada for anything First Nations

12:44.880 --> 12:48.440
related, from the aforementioned residential school system, to missing indigenous prostitutes,

12:48.440 --> 12:51.960
to the pipeline stuff, to the land treaties and the hunting and fishing rights, to anything

12:51.960 --> 12:54.120
else that could be considered racist or colonial.

12:54.120 --> 12:58.100
The residential school system, by the way, was a series of Catholic run government funded

12:58.100 --> 13:01.020
schools specifically designed for indigenous children.

13:01.020 --> 13:05.200
Early in their history, they were noteworthy for being a component of the actual genocide

13:05.200 --> 13:09.840
that took place, where the RCMP stole children from their parents to be culturally re-educated

13:09.840 --> 13:10.840
to be Western.

13:10.840 --> 13:15.080
A lot of real physical and sexual abuse happened at these schools, and they are considered

13:15.080 --> 13:19.040
one of those legitimately dark spots in Canadian history, causing a lot of intergenerational

13:19.040 --> 13:23.840
physical abuse, PTSD, substance abuse, and suicide among Canada's indigenous population.

13:23.840 --> 13:29.060
The final school closed in 1997, and the remaining survivors of the system received both an official

13:29.060 --> 13:31.860
apology from the government as well as financial compensation.

13:31.860 --> 13:36.960
That being said, the residential school system first kicked into gear in 1894, and the vast

13:36.960 --> 13:40.920
majority of the abuse happened earlier in the system's life rather than later.

13:40.920 --> 13:46.320
A number of reforms, most notably in 1969, changed how the residential schools operated,

13:46.320 --> 13:49.760
and by the time the final ones were closing their doors, the schools had reformed to the

13:49.760 --> 13:53.800
point they were actually decent institutions, and there was even some resistance by the

13:53.800 --> 13:55.440
indigenous students served by them.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.960
But in the end, the historical stain was too great.

13:57.960 --> 14:01.480
Mention the phrase at residential school to a Canadian, and you'll hear more sorrys than

14:01.480 --> 14:03.620
you ever thought possible, even from us.

14:03.620 --> 14:08.540
Something came to a head when, last year, there was a widely publicized mass grave site

14:08.540 --> 14:10.060
found at one of these residential schools.

14:10.060 --> 14:13.620
I even did a video on it myself, reporting on the information available at the time,

14:13.620 --> 14:16.260
and there's a lot more information available now, one year on.

14:16.260 --> 14:19.740
The newly publicized existence of this mass grave site brought that Canadian shame and

14:19.740 --> 14:22.420
self-flagellation back to the forefront once again.

14:22.420 --> 14:25.660
Everybody was wearing orange and talking about how awful Canada is and how white settlers

14:25.660 --> 14:29.380
should be ashamed and need to gracefully bow and step back and castrate themselves in the

14:29.380 --> 14:30.380
name of diversity.

14:30.380 --> 14:32.820
Everyone was tripping all over themselves as to how badly they felt about it.

14:32.820 --> 14:34.700
The only problem is, it's not true.

14:34.700 --> 14:37.540
It's been a year now, and not a single body has been found.

14:37.540 --> 14:41.100
A professor of history at the University of Montreal, with a French name that I can't

14:41.100 --> 14:42.620
pronounce, published this article.

14:42.620 --> 14:45.440
In Kamloops, not one body has been found.

14:45.440 --> 14:49.740
He examined all of the data publicly available from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,

14:49.740 --> 14:53.740
the body meant to investigate the truth of the residential schools, where it compiled

14:53.740 --> 14:57.860
all government records, all school records, all band records, and all church records,

14:57.860 --> 14:58.860
and made them public.

14:58.860 --> 15:01.140
And he found it was all just a bunch of bullshit.

15:01.140 --> 15:06.460
Last year's news story broke because an anthropologist, Sarah Bouillot, used a new ground-penetrating

15:06.460 --> 15:10.220
radar technology on a location suspected to be a mass gravesite.

15:10.220 --> 15:14.860
And her preliminary report did identify abnormalities in the soil that could be bodies, but also

15:14.860 --> 15:19.260
could be tree roots in the soil of an apple orchard on the old school grounds.

15:19.260 --> 15:23.500
There has, as of yet, been no exhumation of any potential bodies at the site.

15:23.500 --> 15:27.020
And Bouillot said specifically the only way to know is to exhume them because this technology

15:27.020 --> 15:29.940
is not enough to determine what's actually down there.

15:29.940 --> 15:33.380
But despite this, and despite the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's conclusion that

15:33.380 --> 15:38.040
there was cultural genocide only and not physical genocide at these schools, the media reported

15:38.040 --> 15:42.560
on the ground-penetrating radar as if it were the smoking gun necessary to condemn all white

15:42.560 --> 15:44.860
Canadians for a crime that happened 100 years ago.

15:44.860 --> 15:49.100
Meanwhile, official records show that 49 students at the Kamloops Residential School died from

15:49.100 --> 15:50.780
1915 to 1964.

15:50.780 --> 15:54.420
Seventeen of them died in a hospital, eight of them on their own reservations as a result

15:54.420 --> 15:59.420
of illness or accidents, four had autopsies, seven had coroner inquests, 24 were buried

15:59.420 --> 16:03.700
at their home reserves cemetery, and only four were buried at the school.

16:03.700 --> 16:08.180
This doesn't sound like a genocidal regime covering up the deaths of children and hiding

16:08.180 --> 16:10.940
them from their parents and dumping the bodies into a big hole in the ground.

16:10.940 --> 16:15.060
A big hole, keep in mind, that would have been dug on the Kamloops reservation as that's

16:15.060 --> 16:18.500
where the school was, right beside the school's actual cemetery.

16:18.500 --> 16:22.140
The chief of the Kamloops reservation stated publicly that the children's remains were

16:22.140 --> 16:26.360
known about in the community to reside in the school's cemetery this whole time.

16:26.360 --> 16:30.400
In my opinion, the reason the band hasn't moved forward with further investigations

16:30.400 --> 16:34.140
is because there's probably no mass grave and now that the spotlight has moved away

16:34.140 --> 16:37.400
from them, they're hoping to just let the topic die.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.880
Other mass grave claims are turning out to be something similar.

16:39.880 --> 16:44.600
On the Cowessess reservation, the claim was made of a mass grave site of 750 people, but

16:44.600 --> 16:47.960
it turned out it was just a derelict cemetery where the crosses marking the graves were

16:47.960 --> 16:50.480
made out of wood and the community had failed to maintain it.

16:50.480 --> 16:53.140
The same thing happened to the residential school near Mission, British Columbia.

16:53.140 --> 16:57.400
The cemetery was left unattended after the school closed in 1914 and was subsequently

16:57.400 --> 16:59.000
overrun with stray cattle.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.180
The Cooper Island school was claimed to have 160 undocumented and unmarked graves by the

17:03.180 --> 17:04.740
Penelakut First Nation.

17:04.740 --> 17:05.740
And um, that's it.

17:05.740 --> 17:09.380
They didn't reveal how they knew about it, they didn't provide any details or records

17:09.380 --> 17:13.420
or stories or evidence, and they stopped talking to all media after making the claim.

17:13.420 --> 17:17.780
182 bodies were found at the Kootenai residential school, but it too was a derelict cemetery,

17:17.780 --> 17:22.340
with a former chief saying, there's no discovery, we knew it was there, it's a graveyard.

17:22.340 --> 17:26.140
The fact there are graves inside a graveyard shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.

17:26.140 --> 17:29.460
It's almost like there's this expectation that indigenous people would have been immortal

17:29.460 --> 17:31.920
had the white man not come along and killed them or something.

17:31.920 --> 17:35.780
A grave with a POC in it isn't automatically a white person's fault.

17:35.780 --> 17:39.260
Now if you want to know the true origins of this mass graves hoax, that is too deep of

17:39.260 --> 17:43.100
a rabbit hole for me to go down, you can go join Lauren Southern as she digs deep into

17:43.100 --> 17:47.220
the psychosis of a white guilt ridden native activist over on her channel.

17:47.220 --> 17:51.100
The TLDR is that this guy is crazy and made it all up, and it went viral hard enough and

17:51.100 --> 17:55.540
was repeated through enough credible outlets that people just now take it as fact, even

17:55.540 --> 17:56.780
though there's no evidence.

17:56.780 --> 17:58.660
That's not my primary purpose in talking about this stuff.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.340
I like Canada, it's an alright place.

18:00.340 --> 18:03.100
Yeah, there's some dark spots in our history, but that's how it is for everybody, that's

18:03.100 --> 18:04.200
not unique to us.

18:04.200 --> 18:07.700
I don't want to take responsibility for something that I didn't do, or at least something that

18:07.700 --> 18:11.940
the white part of me didn't do, and if that's individualistic and therefore white supremacy,

18:11.940 --> 18:12.940
I don't care anymore.

18:12.940 --> 18:17.060
You'd have to be exceptionally stupid to consider individual responsibility a white only trait.

18:17.060 --> 18:19.600
I don't infantilize all non-white people like that.

18:19.600 --> 18:23.480
But I think, most importantly of all, I'm just done with the imposed guilt of it.

18:23.480 --> 18:26.880
I'm not guilty of anything just because I'm white, or to some people, I'm white passing,

18:26.880 --> 18:28.560
and I'm tired of pretending like I am.

18:28.560 --> 18:31.960
I'm tired of the social expectation that I apologize because of the actions of people

18:31.960 --> 18:34.220
who look like me, who did what they did before I was even born.

18:34.220 --> 18:39.560
I'm tired of the quasi-neo-fascist, land-back bullshit, while at the same time they call

18:39.560 --> 18:41.400
all white people Nazis.

18:41.400 --> 18:46.160
I'm tired of people screaming settler colonialism, like the quality of life here isn't actually

18:46.160 --> 18:47.320
pretty fucking good.

18:47.320 --> 18:50.840
Despite the myriad of problems that Canada faces, don't worry, I know all about them,

18:50.840 --> 18:54.760
this is still a great place, all things considered, we're still a liberal democracy despite the

18:54.760 --> 18:55.760
threats that we face.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.440
In other words, Canada good, simple as.

18:58.440 --> 19:03.160
And I'm not going to boycott Canada Day, or wear orange, or feel bad about thinking well

19:03.160 --> 19:04.160
of my home anymore.
