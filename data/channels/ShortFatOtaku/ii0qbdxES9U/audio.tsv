0	8720	Canada is well known as an exceptionally polite country.
8720	13280	So much so that we had to pass a law stating that just because we say sorry after an accident,
13280	15720	it can't be taken as an admission of guilt in court.
15720	20860	Yes, that urban legend is real, it's called the Apology Act of 2009, enshrining that casually
20860	24120	saying sorry is an expression of empathy and nothing more.
24120	28200	However, the polite Canadian image is alive and well among Canadians, specifically because
28200	30280	we like to contrast ourselves with Americans.
30280	34320	There's a lot of deep rooted anxiety among Canadians about being too American and trying
34320	37940	to carve out a uniquely Canadian identity, presumably because Canada is actually pretty
37940	41800	backwater all things considered, and Canadians like to pretend that we're a lot more important
41800	43540	on the world stage than we actually are.
43540	48060	This has led Canadians to adopt a thing simply because it's the opposite of Americana, including
48060	52640	the image of being overtly polite and humble versus the boisterous individuality of your
52640	53880	stereotypical American.
53880	57840	This has also led to a strange phenomenon where the most nationalist Canadians are left
57840	63520	wing, as Canada exemplifies to them the antithesis of the scary right wing American nationalism,
63520	67240	a topic that conservative Vancouverite JJ McCullough covered a few years ago.
67240	70800	However, not all Canadian leftists are Canadian nationalists.
70800	75320	Some are your bog standard internationalist progressive cosmopolitan socialist type and
75320	80800	others are indigenous nationalists who frankly resemble other racial nationalists in their
80800	85000	rhetoric, but they're fully accepted on the left as revolutionary allies because they're
85000	87320	part of a historically oppressed racial group.
87320	91720	That's why in the past few years, the polite Canadian myth has received some pushback from
91720	96600	within, that the whole polite thing is just a successful spin campaign to whitewash Canada's
96600	100680	colonial legacy in regards to the indigenous tribes that existed here before white people
100680	101680	showed up.
101680	106240	And to give the devil his due, Canada's relationship with her colonial period is roughly analogous
106240	107280	to America's.
107280	111800	The initial extermination happened not due to overt warfare, but exposure to European
111800	115880	diseases that the natives had no immunity to, leading to a period of rapid depopulation.
115880	118960	It's not to say that the Canadians or the Americans were completely blameless.
118960	123320	There was also bloodshed and conflict and broken treaties and a reservation system set
123320	125640	up specifically to disenfranchise indigenous people.
125640	129980	With their community lacking in both technology and manpower, there was no real hope in mounting
129980	132920	any sort of resistance against colonial expansion.
132920	136920	And then, after the frontiers settle and the nation is formed, these events are forgotten
136920	137920	about.
137920	142760	Both America and Canada, in common history, is remembered as being simultaneously empty,
142760	147280	devoid of people, and at the same time full of friendly faces who were happily welcoming
147280	148940	their new white overlords.
148940	152520	Every nation has a piece of their history that they're not proud of, and this is Canada's.
152520	156240	Thankfully, we live in an era where it's no longer considered morally acceptable to conquer
156240	157920	other people and take their land.
157920	161080	But this is the stuff that I remember learning about in Canadian history class in school.
161080	162800	And from what I remember, it was taught pretty neutrally.
162800	167080	In terms of what was in the textbook, there was no the natives never existed or the natives
167080	171440	were happy to invite Europeans in, but there was also no we're all white oppressors who
171440	173780	need to atone for the sins of our ancestors either.
173780	174780	History is history.
174780	178080	We neither need to atone for it or to live by its standards.
178080	182840	In that polite Canadian article, an event is referenced from 2020 where NDP leader Jagmeet
182840	187040	Singh called a fellow member of the House of Commons a racist and was removed from the
187040	188640	House after refusing to apologize.
188640	191560	It should be obvious to anybody how progressives reacted to that.
191560	193840	He was considered a hero for speaking truth to power.
193840	195880	But here is the actual timeline of events.
195880	201160	The RCMP, Canada's federal level police force, was under scrutiny for accusations of systemic
201160	202160	racism.
202160	205960	The House of Commons was moving to set up a committee to investigate those claims.
205960	209440	During the session where the details of such a committee were being ironed out, Singh used
209440	214020	his time to ask the House of Commons to recognize that there is indeed systemic racism within
214020	218920	the RCMP and therefore review their budget, implement additional oversight and boost funding
218920	220600	to mental health and addiction support.
220640	221640	Do you see the problem here?
221640	223640	Realize how you feel about those proposals, I mean.
223640	227280	The House of Commons was discussing the formation of a committee to investigate the claim of
227280	232400	systemic racism within the RCMP and Singh's demand assumed that the systemic racism already
232400	233400	existed.
233400	236640	The Quebec separatist faction of the House declined to support Singh's motion because
236640	241360	they believed that it would render the committee unable to impartially investigate the possibility
241360	245840	of systemic racism within the RCMP as the motion assumed that it existed before the
245840	247040	committee even began its work.
247480	252120	In response, Singh called the currently speaking MP opposing him a racist, and he refused to
252120	253120	apologize later.
253120	256200	His opponents simply wanted a real, impartial investigation.
256200	259780	But if you don't automatically assume racism, you're a racist.
259780	265300	And of this event, that polite Canadian article says, quoting professor Julie Rak at the University
265300	271040	of Alberta's English and Film Studies departments, who focuses on life writing, book history,
271040	276000	online identity construction, gender and sexual theory, cultural materialist theory, Inuit
276000	281600	writing, mountaineering writing, and autobiographical comics, it gets to the heart of what niceness
281600	283720	or politeness actually represents.
283720	288280	Canadian niceness, you can really equate with Canadian whiteness, and you can really equate
288280	290240	that with Canadian Britishness.
290240	293720	Far from being just an innate virtue, politeness has a history.
293720	295680	Being polite is about power.
295680	298180	It's a response to something that may not address the problem.
298180	303000	It's not that we need to be rude, but politeness papers over or ignores the real situation.
303000	304920	There's just too much here to go into for this video.
304920	307840	I'll save for the future when I inevitably do the civility politics video.
307840	312240	What I'm getting at is there's a view among some Canadian progressives that Canadian politeness
312240	316920	is simply being mask on and that Canada is founded on the same settler colonialism that
316920	317920	America is.
317920	321180	All right, considering our history, I can see that point of view.
321180	323580	But in Canada, they're taking it a step further right now.
323580	329120	There is a prevailing view here that right now, there's an ongoing genocide of indigenous
329120	333860	people because Canada has a definition of genocide that nobody else uses, which basically
333860	338300	amounts to if there is any systemic racism or oppression, it's a genocide.
338300	342260	I hope I don't have to say this, but this is a ridiculous view.
342260	345140	Even if there is systemic racism, that doesn't mean there's genocide.
345140	346140	Things can be bad.
346140	349980	They can even be really bad without being the worst thing ever at all times.
349980	353500	By the way, this is also why there isn't a trans genocide right now either.
353500	357340	So that's the progressive who thinks that Canadian politeness is a mask hiding our evil
357340	358380	racist ways.
358380	361700	However, there is a separate group of progressives who think that Canadian politeness is not
361700	362700	a mask.
362700	363700	It's real.
363700	366580	At the same time, we are also evil and racist anyway.
366580	370500	This group believes in the whole indigenous genocide thing too, but channels that Canadian
370500	374740	politeness into a form of public self-flagellation over the guilt of it all.
374740	378440	That yes, we are all guilty of not only the past, but the totally real genocide happening
378440	381960	right now, simply by virtue of being white settler Canadians.
381960	385500	If you want to see this point of view in action, watch any sort of Canadian official press
385500	388520	conference or political debate or speech at a university.
388520	392660	It's become trendy to apologize to the native tribe the land that the venue is on was stolen
392660	393660	from.
393660	397380	Hello everyone, bienvenue.
397380	401340	I would like to begin today by acknowledging that we are in the unceded and unsurrendered
401340	404940	territory of the Algonquin Anishinabek nation.
404940	410020	I am honored to be here and would like to remind those of us who are settlers of our
410020	417500	great responsibility towards justice and especially in a country that is still perpetuating ongoing
417500	418500	genocide.
418500	425460	Today, I am here for the occasion of the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Intersexism
425460	427680	and Transphobia.
427680	429520	This week is very special to me.
429520	435100	I am celebrating my one year on hormone replacement therapy and 13 months after I had my chest
435100	436100	surgery.
436100	440460	There was a controversy back in 2019 where the CBC, Canada's state-funded news outlet,
440460	445540	posted an article titled, Dear White People, where the indigenous author was a raging racist.
445540	448420	An investigation into the article led to this justification.
448420	452540	It is important to note that the complainant and Ms. Inutik have very different interpretations
452540	453600	of the word racist.
453600	456780	The complainant appears to see it through the lens of individuals beliefs or actions
456780	461300	in which racism is doing something which might signify prejudice, hatred or intolerance.
461300	465580	Ms. Inutik sees racism as a system of oppression in which one culture has been dominant while
465580	467060	another is disadvantaged.
467060	470420	It is historic and seeps into almost every aspect of life.
470420	474300	Through that lens, it is understandable that she would write that racism against white
474300	477980	people does not exist or all white people are racist to some degree because they are
477980	481060	born and raised in a system made by white people for white people.
481060	485700	It also offers some insight into why her column might be acceptable when a column titled Dear
485700	487700	Black People would almost certainly not be.
487700	491460	I will not even try to bridge the divide between these two ways of defining racism.
491460	495900	However, I must say that in Canadian society, it is unreasonable to equate the impact of
495900	500340	a column criticizing white people versus a column criticizing indigenous people or any
500340	502540	other group which has historically been marginalized.
502540	506180	In other words, the CBC is not going to try to make anybody understand, they're just
506180	509940	going to accept the view that all racism is systemic and therefore all white people
509940	512260	are oppressors because debating it is problematic.
512260	516580	And in 2020, people shrieked their head off after a native woman answered the door while
516580	518020	stoned off her ass.
518020	522660	Notice that the cops were on her porch, attacked the cops and was shot dead in self-defense
522660	523660	by them.
523660	527940	The cops were accused of racism and the entire police force was systematically racist and
527940	531900	Canada was a settler colonial system designed to destroy non-white people and does any of
531900	534220	this sound kind of familiar to you, Americans?
534260	538540	Meanwhile, that very same settler colonial system set up to only benefit white people
538540	543340	has these incredible educational slides meant for government employees to view.
543340	548820	White supremacy culture is such negative qualities as a sense of urgency, defensiveness, worship
548820	553020	of the written word, fear of open conflict, individualism, objectivity.
553020	557360	At the same time, there's socially acceptable covert white supremacy like not challenging
557360	562180	a racist joke or claiming reverse racism or bootstrap theory or belief in a post-racial
562180	566780	society or colorblindness or wait, wait, wait, that word colorblindness, that's spelled
566780	567780	the American way.
567780	570740	They didn't even get a Canadian to make this fucking thing.
570740	572780	They just took whatever was floating around on Tumblr, didn't they?
572780	574340	This story here was a big deal too.
574340	577000	The police were refusing to remove indigenous lobster traps.
577000	581180	So non-indigenous sailors were doing it themselves because they were operating out of season
581180	582180	without a license.
582180	586220	And it turns out once the authorities finally investigated, they discovered that these operations
586220	591180	were actually harming the local ecosystem by overwhelmingly targeting undersized lobsters
591180	593200	before they had a chance to grow and reproduce.
593200	596420	The first nation doing this sort of thing claims to have a treaty with the feds to be
596420	598460	able to fish as much as they want at any time.
598460	599700	The jury is still out in that claim.
599700	603820	But even if true, how much do you expect them to rely on worship of the written word now
603820	606700	that it would be in their favor despite the damage that it's causing?
606700	610580	But by far the most publicized event of this type, at least domestically here in Canada,
610580	614580	are the oil pipeline disputes where companies want to build pipelines from the Pacific Coast
614580	617900	and BC across the Rocky Mountains to the oil fields in Alberta.
617900	621160	It cuts through the traditional lands of several indigenous peoples and they're all up and
621160	622140	arms about it.
622140	625160	The government has included them on the project, hearing their concerns about environmental
625160	628880	impacts and they've taken extra safety precautions to try to meet the demands.
628880	632080	Some of the concerns are not environmental in nature, but they're economic.
632080	635420	Some groups simply wanted a piece of pie in exchange and hey, fair enough.
635420	639760	If there's one surefire way to raise a community out of poverty, it's access to jobs and development.
639760	644300	But for some groups, it wasn't economic concerns or environmental ones, but rather sovereignty.
644300	648720	In Canada, we've got the ban system set up by the awkwardly named Indian Act.
648720	653120	The TLDR is that each First Nation is democratically represented by a banned council which is headed
653120	654820	up by an elected chief.
654820	658320	Sometimes the ban represents a reservation and its people, sometimes several reservations,
658320	661380	and sometimes just a group of people who don't live on an official reserve.
661380	666080	But there are some indigenous groups who wholly reject the ban and reserve system, instead
666080	671040	opting to follow hereditary chiefs descended from historic leaders pre-European contact.
671040	676560	To them, the ban system, despite being rooted in democracy, is just a tool of white colonialism.
676560	681200	And their semi-tribal, semi-feudal hereditary system of government is the one with real legitimacy.
681200	684700	This is where we get to the Shuswap people, one of the groups who claim land right in
684700	686240	the way of pipeline construction.
686240	690040	A splinter group of theirs, calling themselves land defenders and later more formally, the
690040	695600	tiny house warriors, claim to get their legitimacy from the Okanagan-Shuswap confederacy, that
695600	699800	the elected ban representatives only have jurisdiction because Canada says they do,
699800	705440	and that their traditional matriarchal hereditary leadership still claims all of Shuswap territory,
705440	707240	standing far beyond the reserve system.
707240	711360	Oh, and for all of the broader left's claim to really hate blood and soil rhetoric, and
711360	716040	to love democracy so much that it must be forced into the workplace, in the end they're
716040	720840	100% okay with siding with a racial monarchy that claims a spiritual connection to the
720840	724560	land based on their ethnicity, as long as there's feathers in the crown.
724560	728200	And at the exact same time as protesters were getting arrested in the way of pipeline construction,
728200	730840	truckers are getting arrested in Ottawa, yes that video is still coming.
730840	734560	You don't even need me to say it, you already know that the progressives were talking out
734560	738320	of both sides of their mouth when it came to how good or evil the cops are.
738320	743000	All of this culminated in the historic cancelling of Canada Day in 2021, where instead of celebrating
743000	746760	our country, we were told to be solemn and reflect on atrocities and understand our white
746760	750720	privilege, and that if we were good people, we would wear orange in solidarity with indigenous
750720	752240	survivors of the residential school system.
752240	755720	Wait a minute, that's not a historic cancelling, they've been calling for that every Canada
755720	759760	Day since Canada's 150th birthday back in 2017, that's an event I also did a video
759760	761280	on way back when.
761280	764880	Orange has since become an activist colour here in Canada for anything First Nations
764880	768440	related, from the aforementioned residential school system, to missing indigenous prostitutes,
768440	771960	to the pipeline stuff, to the land treaties and the hunting and fishing rights, to anything
771960	774120	else that could be considered racist or colonial.
774120	778100	The residential school system, by the way, was a series of Catholic run government funded
778100	781020	schools specifically designed for indigenous children.
781020	785200	Early in their history, they were noteworthy for being a component of the actual genocide
785200	789840	that took place, where the RCMP stole children from their parents to be culturally re-educated
789840	790840	to be Western.
790840	795080	A lot of real physical and sexual abuse happened at these schools, and they are considered
795080	799040	one of those legitimately dark spots in Canadian history, causing a lot of intergenerational
799040	803840	physical abuse, PTSD, substance abuse, and suicide among Canada's indigenous population.
803840	809060	The final school closed in 1997, and the remaining survivors of the system received both an official
809060	811860	apology from the government as well as financial compensation.
811860	816960	That being said, the residential school system first kicked into gear in 1894, and the vast
816960	820920	majority of the abuse happened earlier in the system's life rather than later.
820920	826320	A number of reforms, most notably in 1969, changed how the residential schools operated,
826320	829760	and by the time the final ones were closing their doors, the schools had reformed to the
829760	833800	point they were actually decent institutions, and there was even some resistance by the
833800	835440	indigenous students served by them.
835440	837960	But in the end, the historical stain was too great.
837960	841480	Mention the phrase at residential school to a Canadian, and you'll hear more sorrys than
841480	843620	you ever thought possible, even from us.
843620	848540	Something came to a head when, last year, there was a widely publicized mass grave site
848540	850060	found at one of these residential schools.
850060	853620	I even did a video on it myself, reporting on the information available at the time,
853620	856260	and there's a lot more information available now, one year on.
856260	859740	The newly publicized existence of this mass grave site brought that Canadian shame and
859740	862420	self-flagellation back to the forefront once again.
862420	865660	Everybody was wearing orange and talking about how awful Canada is and how white settlers
865660	869380	should be ashamed and need to gracefully bow and step back and castrate themselves in the
869380	870380	name of diversity.
870380	872820	Everyone was tripping all over themselves as to how badly they felt about it.
872820	874700	The only problem is, it's not true.
874700	877540	It's been a year now, and not a single body has been found.
877540	881100	A professor of history at the University of Montreal, with a French name that I can't
881100	882620	pronounce, published this article.
882620	885440	In Kamloops, not one body has been found.
885440	889740	He examined all of the data publicly available from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,
889740	893740	the body meant to investigate the truth of the residential schools, where it compiled
893740	897860	all government records, all school records, all band records, and all church records,
897860	898860	and made them public.
898860	901140	And he found it was all just a bunch of bullshit.
901140	906460	Last year's news story broke because an anthropologist, Sarah Bouillot, used a new ground-penetrating
906460	910220	radar technology on a location suspected to be a mass gravesite.
910220	914860	And her preliminary report did identify abnormalities in the soil that could be bodies, but also
914860	919260	could be tree roots in the soil of an apple orchard on the old school grounds.
919260	923500	There has, as of yet, been no exhumation of any potential bodies at the site.
923500	927020	And Bouillot said specifically the only way to know is to exhume them because this technology
927020	929940	is not enough to determine what's actually down there.
929940	933380	But despite this, and despite the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's conclusion that
933380	938040	there was cultural genocide only and not physical genocide at these schools, the media reported
938040	942560	on the ground-penetrating radar as if it were the smoking gun necessary to condemn all white
942560	944860	Canadians for a crime that happened 100 years ago.
944860	949100	Meanwhile, official records show that 49 students at the Kamloops Residential School died from
949100	950780	1915 to 1964.
950780	954420	Seventeen of them died in a hospital, eight of them on their own reservations as a result
954420	959420	of illness or accidents, four had autopsies, seven had coroner inquests, 24 were buried
959420	963700	at their home reserves cemetery, and only four were buried at the school.
963700	968180	This doesn't sound like a genocidal regime covering up the deaths of children and hiding
968180	970940	them from their parents and dumping the bodies into a big hole in the ground.
970940	975060	A big hole, keep in mind, that would have been dug on the Kamloops reservation as that's
975060	978500	where the school was, right beside the school's actual cemetery.
978500	982140	The chief of the Kamloops reservation stated publicly that the children's remains were
982140	986360	known about in the community to reside in the school's cemetery this whole time.
986360	990400	In my opinion, the reason the band hasn't moved forward with further investigations
990400	994140	is because there's probably no mass grave and now that the spotlight has moved away
994140	997400	from them, they're hoping to just let the topic die.
997400	999880	Other mass grave claims are turning out to be something similar.
999880	1004600	On the Cowessess reservation, the claim was made of a mass grave site of 750 people, but
1004600	1007960	it turned out it was just a derelict cemetery where the crosses marking the graves were
1007960	1010480	made out of wood and the community had failed to maintain it.
1010480	1013140	The same thing happened to the residential school near Mission, British Columbia.
1013140	1017400	The cemetery was left unattended after the school closed in 1914 and was subsequently
1017400	1019000	overrun with stray cattle.
1019000	1023180	The Cooper Island school was claimed to have 160 undocumented and unmarked graves by the
1023180	1024740	Penelakut First Nation.
1024740	1025740	And um, that's it.
1025740	1029380	They didn't reveal how they knew about it, they didn't provide any details or records
1029380	1033420	or stories or evidence, and they stopped talking to all media after making the claim.
1033420	1037780	182 bodies were found at the Kootenai residential school, but it too was a derelict cemetery,
1037780	1042340	with a former chief saying, there's no discovery, we knew it was there, it's a graveyard.
1042340	1046140	The fact there are graves inside a graveyard shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.
1046140	1049460	It's almost like there's this expectation that indigenous people would have been immortal
1049460	1051920	had the white man not come along and killed them or something.
1051920	1055780	A grave with a POC in it isn't automatically a white person's fault.
1055780	1059260	Now if you want to know the true origins of this mass graves hoax, that is too deep of
1059260	1063100	a rabbit hole for me to go down, you can go join Lauren Southern as she digs deep into
1063100	1067220	the psychosis of a white guilt ridden native activist over on her channel.
1067220	1071100	The TLDR is that this guy is crazy and made it all up, and it went viral hard enough and
1071100	1075540	was repeated through enough credible outlets that people just now take it as fact, even
1075540	1076780	though there's no evidence.
1076780	1078660	That's not my primary purpose in talking about this stuff.
1078660	1080340	I like Canada, it's an alright place.
1080340	1083100	Yeah, there's some dark spots in our history, but that's how it is for everybody, that's
1083100	1084200	not unique to us.
1084200	1087700	I don't want to take responsibility for something that I didn't do, or at least something that
1087700	1091940	the white part of me didn't do, and if that's individualistic and therefore white supremacy,
1091940	1092940	I don't care anymore.
1092940	1097060	You'd have to be exceptionally stupid to consider individual responsibility a white only trait.
1097060	1099600	I don't infantilize all non-white people like that.
1099600	1103480	But I think, most importantly of all, I'm just done with the imposed guilt of it.
1103480	1106880	I'm not guilty of anything just because I'm white, or to some people, I'm white passing,
1106880	1108560	and I'm tired of pretending like I am.
1108560	1111960	I'm tired of the social expectation that I apologize because of the actions of people
1111960	1114220	who look like me, who did what they did before I was even born.
1114220	1119560	I'm tired of the quasi-neo-fascist, land-back bullshit, while at the same time they call
1119560	1121400	all white people Nazis.
1121400	1126160	I'm tired of people screaming settler colonialism, like the quality of life here isn't actually
1126160	1127320	pretty fucking good.
1127320	1130840	Despite the myriad of problems that Canada faces, don't worry, I know all about them,
1130840	1134760	this is still a great place, all things considered, we're still a liberal democracy despite the
1134760	1135760	threats that we face.
1135760	1138440	In other words, Canada good, simple as.
1138440	1143160	And I'm not going to boycott Canada Day, or wear orange, or feel bad about thinking well
1143160	1144160	of my home anymore.
