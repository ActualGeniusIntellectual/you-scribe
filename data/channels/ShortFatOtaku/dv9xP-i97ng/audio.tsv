0	21440	Borderlands 3 came out about a week ago, and it appears to be a rip-roaring success.
21440	26360	Borderlands 3 has twice as many players as its predecessor, despite some performance
26360	28080	issues and epic exclusivity.
28240	32320	Yeah, just a few bugs, a launcher nobody likes, but no big deal, right?
32320	38160	I mean, according to Randy Pitchford, Gearbox's CEO, the launch day peak concurrent players
38160	43560	of Borderlands 3 is about twice as high as the all-time peak concurrent players of Borderlands
43560	44560	2.
44560	45640	That is quite impressive.
45640	49160	So what's with my doom and gloom title, the collapse of Gearbox?
49160	52520	Well first I would like to talk about the other part of the title, the indefensible
52520	53520	bit.
53520	57600	Indefensible began as a series on indie game devs and their corruption, back during Gamergate's
57600	58600	relevance period.
58600	62320	At this point though, I'm just going to use this series as a way to discuss corruption,
62320	66640	cultural Marxism, and general cultural war BS in all of gaming, because Gamergate just
66640	70960	isn't relevant anymore, and SFO's not primarily a gaming news channel, so I figured
70960	73640	I'd just put all the gaming stuff under one tag, okay?
73640	79440	Let's begin with what is unfortunately probably not true, although I wish it were, and I think
79440	81840	there are some portions that might be.
81840	86280	This post started floating around shortly after the Epic Games Store exclusivity deal
86280	88080	for Borderlands 3 went public.
88080	91480	I've messaged what I'm about to say to several YouTubers as protests for the Epic
91480	95440	Games exclusive deal, so now I'm telling you all here in case they twist what I said.
95440	99020	Randy Pitchford is on Twitter right now taking the high ground as if he had nothing to do
99020	100020	with it.
100020	104300	Our publisher had no interest in Epic exclusive until Randy pushed it and convinced them to
104300	107180	do it all because he wants a bigger bonus that he didn't earn.
107180	109800	He screams and yells at us over the smallest thing.
109800	113280	He's a big bully almost, and you can see that if you watch the press conference with
113280	115320	how nervous the others look next to him.
115360	119600	Well, here's that press conference, and Randy does look all sunshine and rainbows,
119600	123120	but oh boy, that is a crowd of unhappy people behind him.
123120	129080	They look like they know if they say one wrong thing, make one wrong move, their ass is grass.
129080	133160	Borderlands 3, by Randy's choice, is pushing online multiplayer hardcore over the story.
133160	137440	We legitimately have our 15 hour campaign done and ready to go, but are forced to make
137440	140580	at least 50 hours of online stuff for launch.
140580	144100	Everything you love about Borderlands 1 and 2 is non-existent in 3.
144100	148240	As a side note, people are generally saying that the writing has gone downhill tremendously
148240	152320	between Borderlands 2 and 3, especially with the characterization of the game's main villains
152320	157100	as religious cult leaders and the heroes playing some kind of edgy atheist pluses.
157100	161220	I guess Randy played Far Cry 5 or Iconoclasts and thought that's what Borderlands 3 should
161220	162220	be.
162220	165460	At the same time, those villainous twins are also live streamers, and their broadcasts
165460	168580	throughout the game are half Twitch stream, half sermon.
168580	170740	And I'm not an idiot, the commentary is clear.
170740	174820	Old media has always hated new media, and as a sub-feud of that, game developers have
174820	179740	always hated YouTubers and streamers, because generally, unlike games journalists, we're
179740	180740	not as corrupt.
180740	184060	You'd be hard-pressed to find a YouTuber willing to be bought to make a fake review
184060	188860	for a game, and when those few YouTubers have done it, it almost always comes out and their
188860	191280	audience almost always drags them for it.
191280	195580	If you've got pent-up disdain for somebody for being both more popular than you, as well
195580	199820	as not answering to your power structure, Borderlands 3 is generally the story you'd
199900	203380	Also, it's quite the feat that the writing's worse than Borderlands 2, considering that
203380	206700	Borderlands 2's writing was absolutely abominable.
206700	208380	Don't tell Angry Joe that, though.
208380	211940	Yes, this is a real screencap from his Borderlands 2 video.
211940	213380	Let's get back to it, though.
213380	217240	After the Epic exclusive was confirmed inside the studio, we were told we were not allowed
217240	220780	to talk about the issues of the platform on our personal Twitters or anything.
220780	223220	I decided to try and confirm this.
223220	226820	Here is a list of the Twitter accounts of Gearbox employees.
226820	231460	This list obviously isn't exhaustive, as Gearbox has hundreds of employees working
231460	235580	for them, but these are the people who listed their position at Gearbox in their bio, all
235580	239180	of whom can be confirmed by both LinkedIn accounts as well as their names appearing
239180	241780	in the credits of various Gearbox games.
241780	245740	Almost none of them have mentioned Epic Games on Twitter, and the few that have do so in
245740	248100	a universally positive light.
248100	251200	Of course, this doesn't necessarily prove that they're banned from talking negatively
251200	253980	about Epic, only that they haven't done so.
254180	257340	It's entirely possible that they all actually like Epic on their own.
257340	261700	It's also entirely possible that Gearbox company policy is that you're just not allowed
261700	264340	to talk about anything controversial at all.
264340	266540	Unless it's Donald Trump, anyway.
266540	271220	A good chunk of the accounts I looked at had their share of Orange Man bad tweets, so maybe
271220	273380	the rule only swings one way.
273380	277680	But here's why I think this is probably a fake, at least somewhat.
277680	281220	As Rebellion, we've stolen a build of the game and will upload to the Pirate Bay if
281220	284220	our demands are not met in 4 weeks.
284220	289900	We want no Epic exclusive, we want better working conditions, we want 40 hour work weeks,
289900	294060	we want Randy Pitchford to take anger management classes, and we want to beat Gearbox 2009
294060	295060	again.
295060	298400	As far as I can tell, the game never did get uploaded to the Pirate Bay, at least not within
298400	301340	this time frame, and I'm pretty sure none of the demands ever got met.
301340	305800	However, it is possible that this post was written by a disgruntled Gearbox employee,
305800	308380	because a lot of other things about it do line up.
308380	311780	For example, Randy Pitchford did indeed take to Twitter to give the Epic Games Store a
311780	313500	very public blowjob.
313500	317820	My expectation is that Epic's investment in technology will outpace Valve substantially.
317820	322380	When we look back at Steam in 5 or 10 years, it may look like a dying store and other,
322380	324700	more competitive stores will be the place to be.
324700	329100	The competitive store that happens to be the leader in 10 years may not be Epic's store,
329100	333220	but it probably won't be Valve's, and Epic's moves right now are opening the door and paving
333220	335860	the way for a vibrant, competitive economy.
335860	339260	Epic is the forcing function that is going to make all this happen.
339260	343180	It's really incredible, but they are the only guys who can really come along to disrupt Steam's
343180	345680	monopoly and help all this get fixed.
345680	347500	They will bring balance to the force.
347500	351880	There has been an intense hatred of Valve and Steam on the social justice side of game
351880	353180	development for a while now.
353180	357180	As soon as Steam allowed anyone to publish their game, regardless of content, as long
357180	361880	as it wasn't a virus or something, game journalists lost their mind at the idea that a major tech
361880	366280	company was not going to censor its users or products on their behalf.
366280	371240	Valve, the owner of Steam, is also not publicly traded, so Chinese state corporations like
371240	375760	Tencent can't buy their way into Steam's pockets the way they did with the Epic game
375760	376760	store.
376760	380720	Steam also refuses to implement service-wide algorithms to make curated content bubble
380720	385280	to the surface of everyone's feeds, another quality that SJWs find objectionable because
385280	390320	they're so used to the false inflation that services like YouTube and Facebook give them.
390320	394440	Instead, Steam displays items that are on sale prominently, and gives you a generated
394440	399080	list of games it thinks you may like based on the games you've recently played, which
399080	402920	unlike YouTube or Facebook's algorithms can actually be disabled.
402920	407760	That's the extent that Steam pushes content onto its users, and today's techy authoritarians
407760	409480	find this unacceptable.
409480	412880	So unacceptable that they'd rather jump into bed with the Epic game store and all
412880	414160	of its huge flaws.
414160	419440	In this larger game, Randy Pitchford is the fall man, the sap who has to explain his company's
419440	420800	selling out to his own install base.
420800	424240	I think I have a slightly different view on monopolies than most people.
424240	428920	Yes, competition can be good for a marketplace, but is competition making the streaming service
428920	433480	industry any better, or is Netflix in the shitter and people are just pirating everything?
433480	438040	The one market state better for the consumer than rigorous competition is a monopoly where
438040	442400	the monopolizer still respects its audience and still manages to innovate.
442400	446760	This almost never happens, because human beings are pretty shitty, but it did happen with
446760	447760	Steam.
447760	452760	Some of the kingly god-like Gabe Newell is, in part, a recognition that the stars actually
452760	457240	did align with Valve, and the Epic store is hated because their disruption means ruining
457240	458240	a good thing.
458240	460920	But our boy Randy doesn't really understand this.
460920	463880	He thinks it's all just gamers being crybabies or something.
463880	467680	Bitch and moan all you want, digital stores and PC are being unmonopolized.
467680	469960	What a galaxy brain to take.
469960	474400	Unmonopolize digital stores and PC by giving one digital store on PC a monopoly on your
474400	476200	game, in exchange for a fat check.
476200	480280	Couldn't unmonopolization mean putting it everywhere all at once, Randy?
480280	483000	Naturally, gamers weren't happy about this turn of events.
483000	487760	And naturally, the powers that be determined that the problem was the gamers and not Gearbox.
487760	491800	When average people have no way to protest, they turn to things like review bombing.
491800	494960	The recent escapades of sites like Rotten Tomatoes have shown us that the powers that
494960	498360	be don't like it when we object to their behavior in this manner.
498360	501540	So now negative reviews have simply become illegitimate.
501540	505960	You automatically lose all credibility for your argument when you stoop to this level.
505960	509680	Purposely trying to tank reviews of previous installments just because you don't like
509680	512160	the decision made for the new release is absurd.
512160	514080	This is mob mentality, not feedback.
514080	517920	I don't know, fuck epic seems to be pretty straightforward feedback to me.
517920	519600	But here's our guy Randy again.
519600	524000	Ironically that this misuse is possible and that Steam has no interest in correcting the
524000	528640	issue makes me kind of happy about 2K's decision and makes me want to reconsider Gearbox
528640	531020	Publishing's current posture on the platform.
531020	533660	Unfortunately for you, this isn't misuse.
533660	534700	This is protest.
534700	538340	You find it to be misuse because you are the target of the protest, Randy.
538340	542100	The privileged always feel like they're being oppressed whenever other people tell them
542100	543280	that they're wrong.
543280	547700	And of course, game journalists moved in lockstep with the rest of the establishment against
547700	553860	gamers and with the bizarrely pro-social justice, pro-socialism large corporations.
553860	556740	As I'm sure we've all expected them to do since 2014.
556740	561620	Confused Borderlands 3 players complain about game in wrong forum.
561620	564060	That's quite the headline about this situation.
564060	567460	LOL aren't gamers idiots, they can't get the forum right.
567460	569340	Oh, oh no.
569340	571800	Everyone knew exactly where it was they were posting.
571800	574660	The point is that they had nowhere else to post their criticism.
574660	577500	But admitting that would mean that you have to accept that Gearbox and Epic are in the
577500	578500	wrong.
578500	580300	And you're not about to do that, are you?
580300	585620	Uh oh, an 85 meta score on Metacritic with only a 3.8 user score.
585620	587820	Is Metacritic the problem too, Randy?
587820	589300	Let's read these reviews.
589300	590300	What a disaster.
590300	591300	Rushed.
591300	592780	Runs poor on a 2080 Ti.
592780	594340	Humor is the worst.
594340	595340	Epic store.
595340	596340	Microtransactions.
596340	597580	Social justice warriors.
597580	599140	It pronouns not they.
599140	601180	Looks like shit for a 2019 game.
601180	602180	Denuvo.
602180	603180	SJWs.
603180	605220	Hello to the banned people because of they.
605220	606220	Epic exclusive.
606220	609620	Okay, okay, what is this they stuff people are on about?
609620	614220	Intentionally misgendering a character could get you banned from Borderlands 3.
614220	617620	The character Flak uses they them pronouns.
617620	619060	Oh fuck.
619060	620900	Respect the pronouns, you bigot.
620900	625940	A moderator of the Borderlands 3 forum wrote in a post on August 12th that the character
625940	631860	Flak was written by a non-binary person and the company is asking forum posters to respect
631860	636620	the creator's wish that Flak be referred to with they slash them pronouns.
636620	641240	Honest mistakes will not result in a ban, the moderator said, but intentional misgendering
641240	643660	of the character will have consequences.
643660	647020	Here's the take of a voice actor from Borderlands 3.
647020	648780	Flak uses they them pronouns.
648780	650300	Flak uses they them pronouns.
650300	652460	Flak uses they them pronouns.
652460	654340	Flak uses they them pronouns.
654340	659060	Stop pushing your own ignorance and anxiety on LGBTQ game devs and gamers.
659060	660060	Smooch.
660060	661060	Ah.
661060	665420	I imagine it's legit difficult for playing what could be your first game without two
665420	668200	plus options for strictly male characters.
668200	670340	That can be legit scary.
670340	672180	But you aren't being erased, I swear.
672180	674260	Everyone has a place in this world.
674260	677380	We just want to give options to those who've never had them.
677380	683140	And if, after that, you still find yourself spitting mad, fuck you, it's 100% canon.
683140	686140	This really is how this type of thing goes every time, isn't it?
686140	690100	It's heaps of condescension with a thin layer of, we just want to give people options on
690100	691100	top.
691100	693100	It's like they know they're taking a shit all over everything.
693100	696280	They're like that bratty kid who cried to the teacher all the time, but when you're
696280	699880	getting the old talking to, they've stopped the fake tears and they're laughing silently
699880	700880	behind their back.
700880	705100	So let me get this straight, Flak is a robotic character who doesn't have a gender but
705100	708020	people have been using it to refer to them.
708020	713140	And well, the character's creator, who is a non-binary person, is just not very happy
713140	714140	about that.
714140	720360	Yep, this obviously non-binary individual, Benjamin Jettleman, who was Flak and Moses
720360	725860	Design Daddy, there's just, there's nothing gendered about this person at all, is there?
725860	728060	Hello, this is fucking epic.
728060	731540	You miss gender, you get sniped, as it fucking should be.
731540	734460	Respect trans NB people or perish.
734460	735740	It's simple.
735740	740940	It's simple guys, except Benjamin is the proud NB he was always meant to be, or a Gearbox
740940	743420	hit squad will straight up fucking murder you.
743420	747380	Oh, did you think I was joking about the whole Gearbox hit squad thing?
747380	749220	No, they exist.
749220	750220	Really.
750220	755580	A YouTuber by the name of Supmato, whose channel revolved around Borderlands content for years,
755580	760020	who was a massive Borderlands superfan, who was one of those guys that would rewatch trailers
760020	764600	of Borderlands 3 like 50 times to find little tidbits of info in the background, or hidden
764600	769060	codes that might mean something since that's how Gearbox loves to run its marketing campaigns.
769060	773340	This dude found a Twitch channel hidden in Borderlands 3 promotional material used by
773340	777260	the Gearbox developers to test out parts of Borderlands 3's integrations.
777260	781380	Supmato used the content on this Twitch channel to make Borderlands 3 videos.
781380	782700	And guess what happened to him?
782700	788340	On April 29th, the official Borderlands YouTube channel posted the reveal of the Twitch extension
788340	792700	leading into the gameplay reveal, which we were all stoked about.
792700	797980	And the name of the testing accounts were exposed in that video, as we've now learned.
797980	802120	This wasn't found by me, it was also posted on various platforms like Reddit and other
802120	803460	social medias.
803460	805880	That's how it was brought to my attention.
805880	811020	So quite a few of us decided to follow these accounts because, well, simply put, we could.
811020	816720	Again, this was all very public, and it was shown to about 185,000 viewers at this point.
816720	823480	And the channel name appears at 052 on the video, when they demonstrated the super cool
823480	828600	integrations that they've been working on, where we can basically become bosses or do
828600	835380	the Moxie Mixer stuff, or in this case, actually win gear watching our favorite streamers.
835380	840940	So this actual Twitch account was linked to all of the other Twitch accounts.
840940	846040	They all just had names where it looked like somebody ran their hand across the keyboard.
846040	850720	We didn't know if it was coded messages like previous stuff, or if it was random.
850720	856720	I again had it brought to my attention elsewhere, and it was exciting.
856720	860120	It was absolutely exciting, and that's why we decided to check it out.
860120	864560	I'll say straight up that it was something we forgot about, but notifications on the
864560	867740	Twitch platform tipped us off on it.
867740	872700	On Thursday, July 25th, private investigators showed up to my home, trespassed on my private
872700	874800	property, and questioned me.
874800	878040	I was very tense, as many of you could imagine.
878040	881480	Having two people in suits you don't know show up to your home.
881480	886280	As lawyers, law enforcement, and family have said, I probably shouldn't have spoke to them,
886280	889760	but I did, because I don't feel I have anything to hide.
889760	894400	They questioned me about various things relating to my channel, the livestream that was discussed
894400	900080	on my channel, which we will get to later, and they told me they were from Take Two Interactive.
900080	905120	I later, after researching on LinkedIn, discovered that they were contracted by Take Two, and
905120	909760	that they have a private firm, where they do various things that private investigators
909760	910760	would do.
910760	915720	We discussed SteamDB, the Rainbow Rarity, which was found in the code by Kobe, and more.
915720	921040	I don't remember it all, because as I said it was tense, and I was definitely uneasy,
921040	924500	but I think we spoke for maybe 30 or 40 minutes.
924500	930640	After the PIs left within maybe 20 minutes, the Discord server was gone, it was terminated,
930640	936580	my account was terminated, and that account and server were terminated for, and I quote,
936580	941980	being involved in selling, promoting, or distributing cheats, hacked, or cracked accounts.
941980	946900	It says nothing about who claimed that this was going on, whether it was Discord or elsewhere.
946900	949420	Again, I won't assume who did it.
949420	953940	I will say that, of course, I haven't done those things, but I will say that the email
953940	958500	also appears to be very automated, so it's probably just a catch-all.
958500	963900	The 26th, I received seven copyright strikes, and one of them still stands.
963900	969540	I don't know how the others were revoked, I wondered if YouTube helped me out, or maybe
969540	971660	they were retracted, I don't know.
971660	974940	I don't have an answer for you, I'm not going to assume.
974940	979120	Now according to the YouTube rules, if you receive four strikes in three months, that's
979120	985640	it, and the channel is terminated, which I fully expected to happen, and it didn't.
985640	989920	As I said, some of the strikes vanished, so the channel stays for now.
989920	996560	These strikes were manually placed by 2K CMS, and the only one that remains is set to expire
996560	998040	at the end of October.
998040	1003560	Yeah, Gearbox and 2K Games have absolutely no problem abusing YouTube's copyright system
1003560	1008080	to nuke somebody's account, but even worse than that, they have no problem sending hired
1008080	1010800	thugs to the guy's house to try and intimidate him.
1010800	1012880	Yeah, they actually did this.
1012880	1015880	Seriously, they admitted it publicly on the verge.
1015880	1022160	2K Games defends necessary actions against YouTuber who shared Borderlands 3 leaks.
1022160	1023680	Necessary actions?
1023680	1027400	Because you were stupid enough to reveal the name of a Twitch account you used to publicly
1027400	1031200	stream Borderlands 3 development, and your most die-hard fans were savvy enough to put
1031200	1032240	two and two together?
1032240	1036720	The action we've taken is the result of a 10 month investigation, and a history of this
1036720	1041120	creator profiting from breaking our policies, leaking confidential information about our
1041120	1044360	product, and infringing on our copyrights.
1044360	1046320	How about you go fuck yourself, 2K?
1046320	1050640	Nothing there had the assumption of confidentiality, not after you publicly released the Twitch
1050640	1051680	URL.
1051680	1054480	Everything used there was fair use, and you know it.
1054480	1058600	And most importantly of all, if you've done this whole 10 month investigation and found
1058600	1063200	that something was actually infringing, why didn't you file charges and take him to court?
1063200	1066000	Is it because you knew that none of your bullshit would actually stick?
1066000	1070280	So the only thing you could actually do was abuse YouTube DMCA takedowns and send some
1070280	1072920	hired goons over to his place to intimidate him?
1072920	1076880	You have the unmitigated gall to behave this poorly, and you expect people to consider
1076880	1079840	your massive overreach as necessary actions?
1079840	1080840	Fuck you.
1080840	1085920	Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of 2K, has a history of pulling this kind of
1085920	1086920	stunt.
1086920	1091520	For example, when Grand Theft Auto V's modding scene was in full swing, Take-Two sent two
1091520	1094600	PIs to one modder's house in an effort to get him to stop.
1094600	1098680	So I just got a pair of PIs at my door claiming to be sent by Take-Two, handing me a phone
1098680	1103120	with a person somewhere in the UK or US or whatever to discuss how to cease my activities
1103120	1106460	with regard to Grand Theft Auto, that they know what happened before with Activision
1106460	1109880	and want not to get the lawyers involved at this time, however they have tested their
1109880	1113680	legal standing already and are quite certain of their point, and aren't willing to accept
1113680	1116340	any solution other than ceasing my activities.
1116340	1120720	In my opinion this is how this shitty sleazy company operates in general, and everyone
1120720	1125480	the chain, from Take-Two down to 2K all the way down to Gearbox, is some level of responsible
1125480	1127160	for this massive overreach.
1127160	1129680	Well at this point, Supmato's channel is gone.
1129680	1133840	He got hit with seven copyright strikes, as far as I can tell, and although he won a lot
1133840	1136400	of the appeals, he simply decided to leave YouTube.
1136400	1139400	I understand man, if you're watching this I hope you come back someday.
1139400	1143400	But even if this event were the only thing I had to talk about in this video, it would
1143400	1147380	be enough for me to never buy Borderlands 3, pirate it if I really wanted to play it,
1147380	1150200	until everybody involved in its creation to fuck right off.
1150200	1152720	And no offense to the guy, but I'm not Supmato.
1152720	1154360	This video won't be going anywhere.
1154360	1155920	If it goes down it'll be on my bit shoot.
1155920	1160560	No matter how many muscle-bound Eskimos Randy hires to march up to my snow-covered igloo
1160560	1161920	to give me the business.
1161920	1163280	Get fucked 2K.
1163280	1168080	But despite the relative success of the Boycott Borderlands 3 hashtag in support of Supmato,
1168080	1170560	Borderlands 3's launch has been going well.
1170560	1172120	Well kinda.
1172120	1176080	In terms of sales, sure, but there's a few strange issues cropping up around the game
1176080	1177080	itself.
1177080	1179040	Where are the cloud saves?
1180040	1181040	Oh.
1181040	1183720	It's just a switch in the Epic launcher, eh?
1183720	1184920	No problem, eh?
1184920	1187400	Stop wanting to turn on the cloud saves, eh?
1187400	1190880	Borderlands 3 PC players report losing their save data.
1190880	1193800	Many users seem to believe the issue lies in the cloud.
1193800	1197240	Multiple players on Twitter have reported problems after activating cloud saves that
1197240	1201560	then either wiped progress completely or reset to an earlier save point.
1201560	1204080	One fan tweeted Gearbox and Epic Games asking,
1210040	1213240	Is there a way to revert it back so I don't lose all the time and all the gear I've got?
1213240	1215000	Yeah, Borderlands 3 deleted my save.
1215000	1216480	Looks like I'll be starting over.
1216480	1218640	I'm guessing this is cloud save related.
1218640	1219640	PSA.
1219640	1221200	Do not turn on cloud saves.
1221200	1225280	Maybe that initial question of where are the cloud saves wasn't so much about, hey, does
1225280	1229600	this game have cloud saves, and more like, where the hell did my save file go?
1229600	1231720	And here's another question that's probably worth asking.
1231720	1233480	Where the hell did my bandwidth go?
1233480	1236480	Flare 2V, a professional streamer, said,
1239480	1245640	My internet can't stream and also handle whatever of my personal data Borderlands 3 is uploading
1245640	1246640	in the background.
1246640	1248960	And take a look at his usage stats.
1248960	1253240	Holy shit, that has a lot of data being sent out by Borderlands 3.exe.
1253240	1256600	I mean, maybe it's all netplay stuff, right?
1256600	1261000	Well, let's talk to the people that cracked a Nuvo about what this could possibly be.
1261000	1264940	This guy understandably didn't want to have his name put out there, since he helped bypass
1264940	1268080	one of the most commonly used anti-piracy services.
1268120	1270200	But he has a lot to say about Borderlands 3.
1270200	1274180	The current Nuvo has been recoded from the ground up, and our leaked source code that
1274180	1276600	was used to circumvent Nuvo no longer works.
1276600	1280860	This latest version with Borderlands 3 is basically a virtual machine, but each time
1280860	1285440	you compile the game, it creates a new assembly language for the game, and a new JIT for it
1285440	1286440	too.
1286440	1287600	Makes it hard to crack.
1287600	1290560	People have to spend a bunch of time trying to map out what Nuvo instruction is, which
1290560	1292000	x86 instruction.
1292000	1295960	Couple that with the fact that the Borderlands 3 game binaries are usually encrypted, and
1295960	1301280	Nuvo itself unencrypts them on the fly, and now forcing a 10 second 2 mbit limit, where
1301280	1305600	any variation in this shuts off your game as tampering, it's hard.
1305600	1307660	It's VM protect, but good.
1307660	1311320	By the way, VM protect is basically a program that will run other programs on an emulated
1311320	1314040	computer with non-standard architecture.
1314040	1317200	Basically meaning that when you run a program, you don't actually run the program.
1317200	1321920	Your computer generates another computer inside of it, which the user, you, have limited access
1321920	1324960	to, and then runs the program on that faked computer.
1324960	1329800	This shit is so intrusive that it would lock up the mouse at random intervals outside of
1329800	1333260	the game due to it checking for unauthorized inputs when I tried injecting.
1333260	1336880	It has to be some kind of keylogging spyware in order to do this.
1336880	1340600	That will be super juicy if we can prove that kind of illegal content on keeping pirates
1340600	1344020	out at the expense of possible user data being mined.
1344020	1347680	Our current study of Borderlands 3 shows the only binary that is encrypted is the main
1347680	1348680	EXE.
1348680	1352200	This new version is indeed a stupidly bloated virtual machine.
1352200	1357040	The main EXE is estimated to be ten times larger than the DRM-free version.
1357040	1359920	The new challenge is how it phones home and gets its encryption keys.
1359920	1363160	It purely depends on your CPU, some sort of hash based off of it.
1363160	1366720	That's why earlier cracks had Intel and AMD specific versions.
1366720	1370640	This one seems to sign a unique key based on your hardware, possibly requiring a different
1370640	1372120	crack for each PC.
1372120	1375120	Shit's fucked until we bypass this and somehow make it universal.
1375120	1376120	Unlikely.
1376120	1377480	Here's the TLDR.
1377480	1381280	Borderlands 3 executable file is ten times larger than it needs to be, and all of that
1381280	1385500	extra stuff isn't the game, it's an application that emulates a virtual computer which then
1385500	1386500	runs the game.
1386500	1389240	This allows the game to strictly control what your PC does.
1389240	1394200	It records all of your PC's actions and inputs, and then sends that data back to Gearbox,
1394200	1397340	requiring 2MB per second of your internet bandwidth to do so.
1397340	1401200	And by the way, this is actually illegal, because secretly installing keyloggers onto
1401200	1403080	a PC is a criminal offence.
1403080	1407080	All of this is done to prevent piracy and send all of your computer's behaviors, actions
1407080	1410560	and data back to Gearbox, 2K or Epic.
1410560	1412720	This all sounds awful.
1412720	1416500	If there were only some kind of workaround, yeah I know you can pirate it, but what if
1416500	1418960	there were something completely legal that we could do?
1418960	1422860	I refunded Borderlands 3 and uninstalled it from the Epic Games Store, but found its install
1422860	1427320	directory and its executable is still there, and I can unfortunately continue to play Borderlands
1427320	1428920	3 even though it's gone.
1428920	1430480	Talk about sick DRM.
1430480	1438280	Okay, so the solution is, legally buy it, legally refund it, then keep playing it.
1438280	1442080	I mean, it's no different from the tired customer service clerk at Walmart taking a
1442080	1445840	refund but not actually checking to see that you didn't give the product back, because
1445840	1447440	they just don't give a shit anymore.
1447440	1449560	The problem is Walmarts, not yours.
1449560	1453480	If the Epic Games Store wants to behave like a sad minimum wage worker in their 60s who
1453480	1456160	has lost all hope for their life, I'm okay with that.
1456160	1460520	But you know, there has to be some benefit to playing Borderlands 3 legit, like having
1460520	1461520	access to all those microtransactions.
1461520	1465720	Wait a minute, I thought Randy Pitchford said there was no microtransactions in Borderlands
1465720	1466720	3.
1466720	1470760	We're working on the big campaign DLC and will probably also offer additional cosmetics,
1470760	1472600	just as we did with Borderlands 2.
1472600	1475720	What we will not do is free-to-play style microtransactions.
1475720	1477960	No premium currency, no loot boxes, etc.
1477960	1479920	Okay, okay, I get it Randy.
1479920	1482600	We'll have DLC campaigns for sale, but no microtransactions.
1482600	1486280	2K Games has sent a statement confirming that cosmetic items will be for sale in Borderlands
1486280	1488640	3.
1488640	1492640	Players will have the option to purchase certain cosmetic items like character, vehicle, and
1492640	1493840	weapon skins.
1493840	1497400	But none of these purchases will be considered pay-to-win or impacting the gameplay, like
1497400	1499000	weapons or actual gear.
1499000	1503800	Okay, so it's Randy's understanding of what a microtransaction is, not what all of our
1503800	1505800	understanding of what a microtransaction is.
1505800	1508980	I mean, Randy even says this in a twitter reply to the article.
1508980	1511720	Come on guys, shitty clickbait headline.
1511720	1514280	Literally seconds before I said that, I made it very clear we're going to be doing more
1514280	1516880	cosmetic stuff like we did in Borderlands 2.
1516880	1520400	You know I was talking about premium currency and loot boxes kind of stuff not being in
1520400	1521400	the game.
1521400	1523200	You know, there's a fair argument to be made here.
1523560	1524560	Loot boxes are pretty shitty.
1524560	1528000	I don't care if they contain only cosmetic stuff like in Overwatch, but if rolling the
1528000	1532040	dice is the only way to progress in the game, like with the whole Battlefront 2 controversy,
1532040	1533600	it makes the game unplayable.
1533600	1537680	At the same time, microtransactions don't just refer to loot boxes or other free-to-play
1537680	1538680	models, Randy.
1538680	1542560	A microtransaction is a tiny purchase within a game to get some in-game item.
1542560	1547680	Cosmetic or impactful, direct purchase or loot box, they're all microtransactions.
1547680	1552320	Buying skins or outfits or decals for vehicles, they're all microtransactions too.
1552440	1556240	And people are angry, Randy, because we yearn for a return to where cosmetics were earned
1556240	1558720	by completing side quests or achievements.
1558720	1562880	You know, like in Borderlands 2, where almost all the cosmetics dropped off bosses or were
1562880	1563880	the product of quests?
1563880	1567340	That's what people want games to be again, Randy, and you're part of the problem.
1567340	1570800	So Borderlands 3's launch is a dumpster fire, but the games media hasn't been talking
1570800	1571800	about it too much.
1571800	1574760	Instead, they've been publishing helpful guides on how to write comedy while still
1574760	1576260	being a proper male feminist.
1576260	1580120	Like PC Game N's Borderlands 3's sense of humor.
1580120	1581120	Be edgy.
1581120	1582120	Be funny.
1582120	1583120	Don't be cruel.
1583120	1584120	Don't be insensitive.
1584120	1586120	Maybe I sound like an old codger who just doesn't get it, but I don't think you
1586120	1588800	can be edgy without being cruel at least a little bit.
1588800	1592200	Every joke has to have a subject, and being the butt of the joke will always be at least
1592200	1593520	a little uncomfortable.
1593520	1597040	Part of being an adult is learning to laugh at yourself rather than lash out in a screeching
1597040	1598720	fit whenever you're made fun of.
1598720	1603720	If your comedy is any good, you will be at least slightly cruel to somebody.
1603720	1605960	A joke about somebody will be cruel to that somebody.
1605960	1608320	A rape joke will be cruel to the person telling the joke.
1608320	1610380	A pun will be cruel to the audience.
1610380	1614680	Comedy requires that somebody, somewhere and sometime end up with egg on their face.
1614680	1618940	If SJWs refuse to do this, then it's no wonder that almost all social justice comedy
1618940	1620560	is completely unwatchable.
1620560	1622800	But there's more to Gearbox than Borderlands 3.
1622800	1624680	Like, hey, Battleborn.
1624680	1628040	Battleborn was a game that basically went head to head with Overwatch and got absolutely
1628040	1629960	fucking annihilated.
1629960	1631440	Nobody played Battleborn.
1631440	1633880	Overwatch had millions of players at its height.
1633880	1638440	According to Steamcharts, Battleborn's all-time peak was 12,000 players.
1638440	1643080	It never broke that 1000 a month average again after its initial launch month, and never
1643080	1646440	made it above 100 again after August of 2017.
1646440	1650220	Gearbox is still paying to keep Battleborn servers running, but the average number of
1650220	1655040	players online at any one time in August of 2019 was just 13.2.
1655040	1660080	The game was meant to support a healthy update cycle like Overwatch, but 14 months after
1660080	1662480	launch, all updates stopped.
1662480	1689880	It was a critical and financial failure for Gearbox.
1689880	1692080	Talk about fucking desperate, dude.
1692080	1695440	Also gamers filled that subreddit up with Overwatch porn just to spite Randy.
1695440	1698840	And I do mean spite him, because at the time of Randy's tweet, the subreddit was pretty
1698840	1702320	new and the vast majority of content on it was from one user.
1702320	1706960	Did Randy Pitchford create his own Battleborn porn in a desperate attempt to save his game?
1706960	1709840	I mean, there's no proof of it, but I like to think so.
1709840	1712600	Randy became particularly salty about this once it was discovered.
1712600	1715960	I was about to block you, but then I read your Twitter bio and realized you probably
1715960	1717400	need more love in your life.
1717400	1718400	Thanks.
1718400	1720200	Wow, what the fuck, attacking somebody personally?
1720200	1721200	That's low, man.
1721200	1722920	You should embrace your failures and laugh at them.
1722920	1723920	You made a crappy game.
1723920	1724920	That's okay.
1724920	1725920	I was being sincere.
1725920	1728320	Also, fuck you for calling our game crappy.
1728320	1729320	We love our game.
1729320	1730320	We love our fans.
1730320	1731320	Randy.
1731320	1732320	What fans?
1732320	1736000	But okay, this is all just fun drama so far.
1736000	1738200	Let's get into the Gearbox fraud.
1738200	1739200	Want to do that?
1739200	1742720	Want to talk about the fraud, the millions of dollars stolen, the extreme incompetence?
1742720	1745560	Sega approached Gearbox to make Aliens Colonial Marines.
1745560	1748600	If you haven't played Aliens, it's a steaming pile of shit.
1748600	1751840	It looks like it was barely worked on, and that's because it was.
1751840	1753920	Aliens Colonial Marines.
1753920	1759480	Gearbox stole funds from Sega to make Borderlands 2 and Duke Nukem Forever.
1759480	1764480	An unnamed Sega staffer has revealed that Gearbox Software stole funds from Sega to
1764480	1767420	make Borderlands 2 and Duke Nukem Forever.
1767420	1771980	These funds were actually for Aliens Colonial Marines, but Gearbox betrayed Sega according
1771980	1773240	to the source.
1773240	1777440	Pitchford and Gearbox wanted to focus heavily on Duke Nukem Forever, but how would they
1777440	1781040	get the money to hire some of the 3D Realms team and even buy the intellectual property?
1781040	1784960	Sure, they made a lot from Borderlands, but guess where they got the money to fund Borderlands
1784960	1786200	in the first place?
1786200	1787200	Yep.
1787200	1788200	Sega.
1788200	1792800	So Gearbox essentially lied to Sega, mishandled funds, broke agreements and contractual obligations
1792800	1796920	to work on other projects, didn't want to work on a game they were contractually obligated
1796920	1798920	to work on, and gave it to another team.
1798920	1802180	Poor organization and direction on Aliens Colonial Marines.
1802180	1805720	Took on too many projects from different companies at once, and other things we may not even
1805720	1806720	know about.
1806720	1810480	Hell, part of me believes that Gearbox wanted this thing delayed as much as possible so
1810480	1812680	they could get more funding to embezzle from Sega.
1812680	1816640	Sega was looking to sue Gearbox, but since Gearbox shipped the product, they couldn't.
1816640	1819000	So what kind of game did we finally get?
1819000	1820000	Oh.
1820000	1821000	Oh no.
1821000	1825600	He's just a cute little alien guy, isn't he?
1825600	1830200	Aliens Colonial Marines was outsourced by Gearbox to another company, Timegate, and
1830200	1834420	some former Timegate employees decided to come forward as well and describe the situation
1834420	1835420	to Eurogamer.
1835420	1839460	Aliens Colonial Marines is heavily regarded as one of the biggest trainwrecks in gaming
1839460	1840460	history.
1840460	1843780	Criticisms have run rampant from its shoddy critical reception to gamers crying afoul
1843780	1847620	of its pre-release demo not being at all representative of the final product.
1847620	1851740	It became apparent that Gearbox had ignored the game for years.
1851740	1856300	According to three staffers, Gearbox had focused the vast majority of its efforts on Duke Nukem
1856300	1858640	Forever, Borderlands, and Borderlands 2.
1858640	1863120	There was obviously not four years of work done on the game, said one source.
1863120	1866640	Apparently what Gearbox gave Timegate was merely a collection of assets with little
1866640	1869600	rhyme or reason as to how it was all planned to come together.
1869600	1873000	A lot of assets just didn't seem like they fit there, the source noted.
1873000	1876320	Perhaps the biggest thing Timegate didn't have when it began developing the game was
1876320	1877500	a script.
1877500	1881720	According to three sources, narrative designers at Gearbox and Timegate were constantly writing
1881720	1885800	and rewriting the game, causing the designers to discard entire levels.
1885800	1888920	For a couple months, we were just kind of guessing, said one source.
1888920	1891780	It's really weird to work on a game when you don't have a basic idea of how things will
1891780	1892780	work.
1892780	1896620	They said many times through demo production, don't worry about performance, just make
1896620	1898900	it awesome, said one source.
1898900	1901420	There's a reason those demos were never really playable.
1901420	1905700	The game feels like it was made in nine months, said a source that worked on the project.
1905700	1906980	That's because it was.
1906980	1911460	And if you needed any more proof that Aliens Colonial Marines was a rushed backburner mess
1911460	1917500	of a project despite it being Gearbox's only financial lifeline from 2008 to 2013, a simple
1917500	1921680	typo in the code is responsible for the goofy behaviors of the aliens in the game.
1921680	1928120	As a user of moddb.com discovered, the biggest bug in the game is just one letter long.
1928120	1932040	Inside your game's configuration file is the following line of code.
1932040	1939160	Class remapping equals pkengame.pkensequenceact underscore attach xeno to tether, points at
1939160	1943720	pkengame.pkensequenceact underscore attach pawn to tether, except it doesn't actually
1943720	1945120	say attach pawn to tether.
1945120	1947560	It says attach pawn to T-ether.
1947560	1951280	The attach pawn to tether function controls the behavior of the enemies in the game, and
1951280	1956400	you fix this one typo, the game's enemies actually act like enemies and not puppets.
1956400	1960240	They had coded behavior for the aliens to stalk around the player, coordinate in groups,
1960240	1963880	patrol areas, attack from a flank, all kinds of cool stuff.
1963880	1966760	And none of it worked because they released the game without giving the code a second
1966760	1967760	pass.
1967760	1971440	As for Duke Nukem Forever, nobody expected that game to actually be good.
1971440	1975720	It was in development hell since 1999, and Gearbox picked up the project just to get
1975720	1977040	something out the door.
1977040	1981880	Yeah, yeah, they siphoned money meant to be used for Alien from Sega, but fine, whatever.
1981880	1984440	Duke Nukem Forever really wasn't Gearbox's fault.
1984440	1987360	They did the best they could with what they were given, and now they own the Duke Nukem
1987360	1988360	IP.
1988360	1990440	It seems like they don't really plan to use it, though.
1990440	1994000	New Duke Nukem game is highly unlikely, says Gearbox.
1994000	1998600	Like a washed up actor, Duke Nukem's future only has cameo appearances instead of starring
1998600	1999600	roles.
1999600	2002720	If you ever wanted to pick a character that modern day Verifieds on Twitter would call
2002720	2006640	the most toxic of them all, Duke Nukem would be that guy.
2006640	2010120	He is the epitome of toxic masculinity, and that's the point.
2010120	2014080	He's an over-the-top caricature, and I've always been fun with laughing at the absurdity
2014080	2015560	of the Duke Nukem games.
2015560	2018940	And despite the previous article, Randy himself said on Twitter,
2018940	2023080	I owe a good part of my early career to the franchise and I love it.
2023080	2027400	But Duke needs a future, we'll take care of the past, but we need to do so in a way
2027400	2029480	that does not ruin the future.
2029480	2031120	What is that future?
2031120	2035680	I mean, there was a shitty cameo of a neutered Duke in Bulletstorm, but that's about it.
2035720	2038640	I could have sworn there was an interview with Randy Pitchford recently where he said
2038640	2043920	that he was glad that he owned the Duke Nukem franchise, because it's pure toxic masculinity,
2043920	2047800	it's harmful to gaming, and as long as he has his way, Duke will never come back.
2047800	2050720	But maybe I just imagined it, because I can't find it anymore.
2050720	2053100	Vice published something similar anyway.
2053100	2056980	How Duke Nukem can be saved for the 21st century, let's see.
2056980	2060040	But there's something different about this invasion, and it's nothing to do with the
2060040	2061800	aliens themselves.
2061800	2065660	This time, the women that Duke used to objectify are fighting back to, and this is where he
2065660	2068500	road to salvation begins.
2068500	2072380	Duke's still a condescending piece of shit, content to fight beside women in a purely
2072380	2075660	isn't-this-cute kind of way, but his allies are shown as equals.
2075660	2078420	When he tries it on, he gets shot down.
2078420	2082140	This is an essay on how a future Duke Nukem game should be all about how Duke realizes
2082140	2083140	that he's problematic.
2083140	2087360	Honestly, the worst part is, if Gearbox ever does make a new Duke game, it'll probably
2087360	2088360	be this.
2088360	2090980	So far, the picture painted is pretty clear.
2090980	2095380	Randy Pitchford has his pet project, Borderlands, and he's taken on other side projects in
2095380	2098380	order to fund his company while he works on the main thing.
2098380	2100120	That's fair, a lot of people do that.
2100120	2104020	But generally, it's expected that you actually produce your side projects and then use the
2104020	2108820	profit to create your main one, not just take the funding and run, leaving wreckage in your
2108820	2109820	wake.
2109820	2115460	Which makes it all the more surprising that, I think, the initial concept for Borderlands
2115460	2117640	was actually plagiarized.
2117640	2123280	The original version of Borderlands 1 looked a lot like a knockoff of Rage, which itself
2123280	2127400	was an extremely mediocre Playstation 3 shooter.
2127400	2132800	This video looks nothing like the Borderlands that eventually came out, but it is, in fact,
2132800	2135200	how the game originally looked.
2135200	2137240	And boy, does it look generic.
2137240	2141880	Gearbox knew their game was in trouble, and needed something to make itself stick out.
2141880	2147880	Here's some clips from a short film titled Code Hunters, made by Ben Hibben for MTV back
2147880	2148880	in 2006.
2148880	2151120	Does it remind you of anything?
2151120	2152580	Anything at all?
2152580	2158100	Is it somewhat similar to the opening sequence to the original Borderlands, perhaps?
2158100	2162220	Maybe some scenes in Borderlands were directly ripped off from Code Hunters, I don't know?
2162220	2167620	In an interview from 2012, Ben Hibben stated that he was contacted by Gearbox prior to
2167620	2170780	the redesign of the game back in 2008.
2170780	2175500	They asked me if I would be interested to direct or design some cutscenes for them.
2175500	2178900	We exchanged a few emails, but the project didn't materialize in the end.
2178900	2183260	I didn't think much of it at the time, until I saw the final game in 2009.
2183260	2187660	I have never created or designed anything for Gearbox or Borderlands.
2187660	2192580	Gearbox saw my work and decided to reproduce it, make it their own, without my help or
2192580	2193580	my consent.
2193580	2197260	The hardest part for me when this happened, was understanding why they wouldn't ask
2197260	2198260	me directly.
2198260	2201520	We were already talking about doing some work together, it made no sense.
2201520	2203740	I understand being inspired.
2203740	2205260	I understand giving homage.
2205260	2209940	But when that's the case, you're not generally calling up the guy to offer him a job, cutting
2209940	2215540	him off without warning, and then forging on ahead with your, for the time, unique style,
2215540	2219100	while remaining publicly silent and ignoring all questions about it.
2219100	2222600	In my opinion, if you're acting this way, you're probably not inspired.
2222600	2226060	You're probably embarrassed that you blatantly ripped somebody off who's more talented
2226060	2227060	than you are.
2227060	2228880	Okay, uh, is this everything?
2228880	2231100	Is that all you've got up that magician's sleeve of yours, Randy?
2231100	2235780	We've got the plagiarism, the misuse of funds, the incompetence, the illegal data-harvesting,
2235780	2239220	the brow-beating of your critics, the constant scum-bucket moves.
2239220	2241140	I think that's all the sins of Gearbox, right?
2241140	2243540	I mean, there couldn't be anything else, could there?
2243540	2245340	How much worse could it get?
2245340	2251980	Plaintiff Wade Callender, in his individual capacity and on behalf of The Hatch LLC, files
2251980	2257340	this original petition against Randell Pitchford II and Gearbox Software.
2257340	2262020	Randy Pitchford is a manipulative and morally bankrupt CEO who shamefully exploited his
2262020	2265960	oldest friend, a Texas attorney and military veteran named Wade Callender.
2265960	2271300	It was Randy himself who breached his duties by exploiting Gearbox employees and property
2271300	2273600	to fund Pitchford's private cravings.
2273600	2278700	For example, while Randy was denying employee raises predicated on low-cash reserves, Randy
2278700	2284260	secretly saddled Gearbox employees with the burden of repaying a private, personal $12
2284260	2289660	million dollar bonus that Randy Pitchford re-routed from Gearbox's publisher directly
2289660	2293820	to Randy's side entity, Pitchford Entertainment Media & Magic.
2293820	2298660	Gearbox was contacted in 2014 by someone who discovered a USB drive at a medieval times
2298660	2301140	restaurant in Dallas County, Texas.
2301140	2305320	Because the USB drive contained sensitive Gearbox corporate material, the Good Samaritan
2305320	2309800	rightly suspected that the USB drive belonged to a high-level Gearbox employee.
2309800	2314200	Upon hearing of the discovery of this drive, Pitchford declared the drive was his and requested
2314200	2315560	a prompt return.
2315560	2320260	While the drive was being recovered in Texas, Pitchford and Callender were in San Francisco
2320260	2325160	mediating yet another case in which Pitchford's conduct was front and center, the alien Colonial
2325160	2326680	Marines case.
2326680	2331440	Pending his return to Texas, Callender instructed Gearbox personnel in Texas to make a copy
2331440	2336240	of the USB drive to ensure that its contents could be verified and, if necessary, acted
2336240	2337240	upon.
2337240	2341620	Before Callender could review the USB drive's contents, Pitchford intervened by retrieving
2341620	2346940	the lost USB drive himself and ordering Gearbox personnel to destroy the copy that Callender
2346940	2347940	requested.
2347940	2352300	On information and belief, Randy Pitchford's USB drive contained much more than the sensitive
2352300	2358220	documents of Gearbox and its business partners like Take-Two Interactive, 2K Games, Sega,
2358220	2360540	Microsoft, Sony, and etc.
2360540	2365100	Upon information and belief, Randy Pitchford's USB drive also contained Randy Pitchford's
2365100	2368040	personal collection of underage pornography.
2368040	2372840	Upon information and belief, Pitchford's USB drive experience wasn't enough to deter
2372840	2378440	Randy Pitchford's mischief, as Pitchford subsequently siphoned Gearbox profits to fund
2378440	2383800	parties thrown by Pitchford and his wife at their home for their own personal benefit.
2383800	2389440	At these events, which Pitchford and his wife affectionately term peacock parties, adult
2389440	2395360	men have reportedly exposed themselves to minors to the amusement of Randy Pitchford.
2395360	2401660	In November of 2016, Pitchford informed Callender that he had reached a side deal with Take-Two
2401660	2403200	and 2K Games.
2403200	2408880	The deal, which Pitchford insisted upon concealing, afforded Randy Pitchford a personal, secretive
2408880	2412200	executive bonus of $12 million.
2412200	2416620	Because Pitchford agreed to have his private bonuses counted as advances upon the royalties
2416620	2421320	owed to Gearbox employees, those employees and their families won't receive any of
2421320	2426760	their profit shares until their work repays Randy's bonus to Take-Two.
2426760	2428640	Holy shit.
2428640	2433480	And here's a cryptic tweet from a former Gearbox vice president and voice of the Borderlands
2433480	2439400	character Claptrap, no longer under Randy's thumb, posted shortly after the lawsuit was
2439400	2440400	filed.
2440400	2442580	Yes, it's true.
2442580	2447820	On the December 22nd episode of the podcast The Piff Pod, Randy Pitchford appears to partially
2447820	2450580	validate Wade Callender's story.
2450580	2454240	He spends a good chunk of the time talking about how he likes to watch pornography labeled
2454240	2459040	barely legal, and how he was particularly mesmerized by a cam girl who once squirted
2459040	2462580	live for him, stating that she's a fucking magician.
2462580	2466300	Apparently Pitchford's interest in her was because, I guess, getting a woman off is a
2466300	2468460	magic trick in his eyes?
2468460	2469460	Yeesh.
2469460	2472220	I know Randy's a magician, but apparently not so much in bed.
2472220	2477220	The podcast's description states, be warned, this podcast is not for the faint-hearted,
2477220	2480940	as Randy gushes about his love of magic, or something like that.
2480940	2482500	Yeah, they knew what was up.
2482500	2485060	So some people are saying child porn.
2485060	2489700	Randy's saying barely legal porn, but no one's talking about those peacock parties.
2489700	2492980	Claptrap's voice actor said it was true, but he's also got some other things to say.
2492980	2497700	I was fine with moving on after Gearbox, but when my former boss starts mouthing off about
2497700	2502820	various aspects of my employment, including how highly compensated I was and how generous
2502820	2506180	he is, I feel obligated to correct the record.
2506180	2510540	I had a lot of mixed feelings when asked to reprise the role of Claptrap, but I put
2510540	2514060	our differences aside and did something cool for Borderlands fans.
2514060	2519500	I offered to do it for free, in exchange for past royalties owed, plus an apology for something
2519500	2521900	I've never spoken about before.
2521900	2527100	Randy physically assaulted me in the lobby of the Marriott Marquis at GDC 2017.
2527100	2530780	I think Randy's been on tilt for the last few years.
2530780	2533140	He's not the victim he portrays himself to be.
2533140	2535460	I blocked him a couple years ago for stalking.
2535460	2540340	As an aside, it seems a bit conspicuous that he chimed in on my salary, but didn't mention
2540340	2544060	anything about the $12 million he siphoned from the employee royalty pool.
2544060	2546340	Eddings later elaborated on the event.
2546340	2549980	He shoved the fuck out of me while I'm on the balls of my feet trying to whisper.
2549980	2551900	He knocked me back four steps.
2551900	2553980	I believe I caught him in a deception.
2553980	2558700	What's more is that Eddings says his claim can be backed up by one of two cooperative
2558700	2561900	witnesses, Gearbox co-founder Landon Montgomery.
2561900	2564300	Montgomery corroborates the assault allegations, saying,
2564300	2569260	David leaned up to whisper something to Randy and out of the blue Randy shoves him, hard.
2569260	2573820	Eddings also offered screenshots from a tirade of Snapchat messages he received from Pitchford
2573820	2578700	after the incident, with the CEO having demanded, who the fuck are you loyal to?
2578700	2581500	And jeering that Eddings' priorities are completely fucked.
2581500	2587740	Yeah, you know that bit in the final Borderlands 2 DLC where Claptrap, with a new voice actor,
2587740	2609620	begs Lilith for his job back?
2609620	2611620	Puts that in a whole new light, doesn't it?
2611620	2614620	But hey, you know what, it's all just okay.
2614620	2615900	It's all fine.
2615900	2620700	After all, Randy Pitchford's a little autistic, he's a little on the spectrum, so we have
2620700	2623700	to forgive him or that's ableist, right?
2623700	2624700	Right guys?
2624700	2629140	You can do whatever you want nowadays, peacock parties, physical assaults, potentially child
2629140	2634020	porn, losing private documents at a restaurant, embezzling funds, stealing money from your
2634020	2638780	employees, stealing money from your partners, intentionally delaying and tanking a game
2638780	2642700	in order to make way for your pet project, ripping off the only unique thing your pet
2642700	2647740	project has from somebody vastly more talented than you, loading up paying customers computers
2647740	2652720	with malware designed to monitor your usage and keylog everything you do and sell it all
2652720	2656740	off to the Epic Store to their Chinese state corporate overlords and physically intimidate
2656740	2659420	anyone who finds out about any of your rotten little schemes.
2659420	2662060	It's all fine if you're a little autistic.
2662060	2664940	Randy just doesn't know any better, you bigot.
2664940	2667540	Let's go all the way back to that initial post.
2667540	2671780	The one that was probably fake because the promised leak of Borderlands 3 never actually
2671780	2672780	came out.
2672780	2676300	Despite that, a lot of the stuff in it ultimately lined up, didn't it?
2676300	2680500	Randy Pitchford is confirmed by multiple people to be a control freak and a bully.
2680500	2684540	Multiple sources and stories show him to be exploiting his employees and shuffling money
2684540	2686500	around in an attempt to line his own pockets.
2686500	2689460	There's a chance he might even be a sexual abuser, too.
2689460	2694660	And Borderlands 3, now that it's out, pales in comparison to Borderlands 2 in nearly every
2694660	2695660	way.
2695660	2698740	I will never buy a game from these people again.
2698740	2702660	I will never recommend that people buy a game from these people again.
2702660	2707900	If I ever want to play Borderlands 3, or any other game made by this company, I will pirate
2707900	2709020	it.
2709020	2711940	If I ever want to stream it, I'll still pirate it.
2711940	2716340	I am done with just putting up with all of these shitty people ruining the great passion,
2716340	2720180	the one hobby, the community we've all shared for most of our lives now.
2720180	2721180	Fuck em.
2721180	2723500	I've got more videos kind of like this one in the works.
2723500	2724500	EA, maybe?
2724500	2725500	Blizzard?
2725500	2726500	Bethesda?
2726500	2727500	I don't know.
2727500	2728500	We'll see.
2728500	2733060	For the premiere of this video, I'll be over on my Twitch channel right now playing
2733060	2737400	a game made by a company that I think is probably one of the last ones out there that doesn't
2737400	2739800	shit the bed this badly.
2739800	2742700	It's the Link's Awakening remake on the Nintendo Switch.
2742700	2747980	Naomi and I are having a great time with it, so drop by twitch.tv slash Game Boomers and
2747980	2748980	say hi.
2748980	2752180	And if you're not watching this video on release day, that's okay.
2752180	2755780	Because I stream most nights on that Twitch anyway, so come give it a look.
2755780	2756780	I'll see you there.
2756780	2757380	I love you.
