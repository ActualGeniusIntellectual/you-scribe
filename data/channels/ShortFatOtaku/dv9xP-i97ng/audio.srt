00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,440
Borderlands 3 came out about a week ago, and it appears to be a rip-roaring success.

2
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,360
Borderlands 3 has twice as many players as its predecessor, despite some performance

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,080
issues and epic exclusivity.

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,320
Yeah, just a few bugs, a launcher nobody likes, but no big deal, right?

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,160
I mean, according to Randy Pitchford, Gearbox's CEO, the launch day peak concurrent players

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,560
of Borderlands 3 is about twice as high as the all-time peak concurrent players of Borderlands

7
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,560
2.

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,640
That is quite impressive.

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,160
So what's with my doom and gloom title, the collapse of Gearbox?

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,520
Well first I would like to talk about the other part of the title, the indefensible

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,520
bit.

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,600
Indefensible began as a series on indie game devs and their corruption, back during Gamergate's

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,600
relevance period.

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,320
At this point though, I'm just going to use this series as a way to discuss corruption,

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,640
cultural Marxism, and general cultural war BS in all of gaming, because Gamergate just

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,960
isn't relevant anymore, and SFO's not primarily a gaming news channel, so I figured

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,640
I'd just put all the gaming stuff under one tag, okay?

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,440
Let's begin with what is unfortunately probably not true, although I wish it were, and I think

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,840
there are some portions that might be.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,280
This post started floating around shortly after the Epic Games Store exclusivity deal

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,080
for Borderlands 3 went public.

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,480
I've messaged what I'm about to say to several YouTubers as protests for the Epic

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,440
Games exclusive deal, so now I'm telling you all here in case they twist what I said.

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,020
Randy Pitchford is on Twitter right now taking the high ground as if he had nothing to do

25
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,020
with it.

26
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,300
Our publisher had no interest in Epic exclusive until Randy pushed it and convinced them to

27
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,180
do it all because he wants a bigger bonus that he didn't earn.

28
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,800
He screams and yells at us over the smallest thing.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,280
He's a big bully almost, and you can see that if you watch the press conference with

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,320
how nervous the others look next to him.

31
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,600
Well, here's that press conference, and Randy does look all sunshine and rainbows,

32
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,120
but oh boy, that is a crowd of unhappy people behind him.

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,080
They look like they know if they say one wrong thing, make one wrong move, their ass is grass.

34
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,160
Borderlands 3, by Randy's choice, is pushing online multiplayer hardcore over the story.

35
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,440
We legitimately have our 15 hour campaign done and ready to go, but are forced to make

36
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,580
at least 50 hours of online stuff for launch.

37
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,100
Everything you love about Borderlands 1 and 2 is non-existent in 3.

38
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,240
As a side note, people are generally saying that the writing has gone downhill tremendously

39
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,320
between Borderlands 2 and 3, especially with the characterization of the game's main villains

40
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,100
as religious cult leaders and the heroes playing some kind of edgy atheist pluses.

41
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,220
I guess Randy played Far Cry 5 or Iconoclasts and thought that's what Borderlands 3 should

42
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,220
be.

43
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,460
At the same time, those villainous twins are also live streamers, and their broadcasts

44
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,580
throughout the game are half Twitch stream, half sermon.

45
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,740
And I'm not an idiot, the commentary is clear.

46
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,820
Old media has always hated new media, and as a sub-feud of that, game developers have

47
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,740
always hated YouTubers and streamers, because generally, unlike games journalists, we're

48
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,740
not as corrupt.

49
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,060
You'd be hard-pressed to find a YouTuber willing to be bought to make a fake review

50
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,860
for a game, and when those few YouTubers have done it, it almost always comes out and their

51
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,280
audience almost always drags them for it.

52
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,580
If you've got pent-up disdain for somebody for being both more popular than you, as well

53
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,820
as not answering to your power structure, Borderlands 3 is generally the story you'd

54
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,380
Also, it's quite the feat that the writing's worse than Borderlands 2, considering that

55
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,700
Borderlands 2's writing was absolutely abominable.

56
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,380
Don't tell Angry Joe that, though.

57
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,940
Yes, this is a real screencap from his Borderlands 2 video.

58
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,380
Let's get back to it, though.

59
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,240
After the Epic exclusive was confirmed inside the studio, we were told we were not allowed

60
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,780
to talk about the issues of the platform on our personal Twitters or anything.

61
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,220
I decided to try and confirm this.

62
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,820
Here is a list of the Twitter accounts of Gearbox employees.

63
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,460
This list obviously isn't exhaustive, as Gearbox has hundreds of employees working

64
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,580
for them, but these are the people who listed their position at Gearbox in their bio, all

65
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,180
of whom can be confirmed by both LinkedIn accounts as well as their names appearing

66
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,780
in the credits of various Gearbox games.

67
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,740
Almost none of them have mentioned Epic Games on Twitter, and the few that have do so in

68
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,100
a universally positive light.

69
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,200
Of course, this doesn't necessarily prove that they're banned from talking negatively

70
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,980
about Epic, only that they haven't done so.

71
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,340
It's entirely possible that they all actually like Epic on their own.

72
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,700
It's also entirely possible that Gearbox company policy is that you're just not allowed

73
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,340
to talk about anything controversial at all.

74
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,540
Unless it's Donald Trump, anyway.

75
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,220
A good chunk of the accounts I looked at had their share of Orange Man bad tweets, so maybe

76
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,380
the rule only swings one way.

77
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,680
But here's why I think this is probably a fake, at least somewhat.

78
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,220
As Rebellion, we've stolen a build of the game and will upload to the Pirate Bay if

79
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,220
our demands are not met in 4 weeks.

80
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,900
We want no Epic exclusive, we want better working conditions, we want 40 hour work weeks,

81
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,060
we want Randy Pitchford to take anger management classes, and we want to beat Gearbox 2009

82
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,060
again.

83
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,400
As far as I can tell, the game never did get uploaded to the Pirate Bay, at least not within

84
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,340
this time frame, and I'm pretty sure none of the demands ever got met.

85
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,800
However, it is possible that this post was written by a disgruntled Gearbox employee,

86
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,380
because a lot of other things about it do line up.

87
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,780
For example, Randy Pitchford did indeed take to Twitter to give the Epic Games Store a

88
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,500
very public blowjob.

89
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,820
My expectation is that Epic's investment in technology will outpace Valve substantially.

90
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,380
When we look back at Steam in 5 or 10 years, it may look like a dying store and other,

91
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,700
more competitive stores will be the place to be.

92
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,100
The competitive store that happens to be the leader in 10 years may not be Epic's store,

93
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,220
but it probably won't be Valve's, and Epic's moves right now are opening the door and paving

94
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,860
the way for a vibrant, competitive economy.

95
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,260
Epic is the forcing function that is going to make all this happen.

96
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,180
It's really incredible, but they are the only guys who can really come along to disrupt Steam's

97
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,680
monopoly and help all this get fixed.

98
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,500
They will bring balance to the force.

99
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,880
There has been an intense hatred of Valve and Steam on the social justice side of game

100
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,180
development for a while now.

101
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,180
As soon as Steam allowed anyone to publish their game, regardless of content, as long

102
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,880
as it wasn't a virus or something, game journalists lost their mind at the idea that a major tech

103
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,280
company was not going to censor its users or products on their behalf.

104
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,240
Valve, the owner of Steam, is also not publicly traded, so Chinese state corporations like

105
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,760
Tencent can't buy their way into Steam's pockets the way they did with the Epic game

106
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
store.

107
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,720
Steam also refuses to implement service-wide algorithms to make curated content bubble

108
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,280
to the surface of everyone's feeds, another quality that SJWs find objectionable because

109
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,320
they're so used to the false inflation that services like YouTube and Facebook give them.

110
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,440
Instead, Steam displays items that are on sale prominently, and gives you a generated

111
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,080
list of games it thinks you may like based on the games you've recently played, which

112
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,920
unlike YouTube or Facebook's algorithms can actually be disabled.

113
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,760
That's the extent that Steam pushes content onto its users, and today's techy authoritarians

114
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,480
find this unacceptable.

115
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,880
So unacceptable that they'd rather jump into bed with the Epic game store and all

116
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,160
of its huge flaws.

117
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,440
In this larger game, Randy Pitchford is the fall man, the sap who has to explain his company's

118
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,800
selling out to his own install base.

119
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,240
I think I have a slightly different view on monopolies than most people.

120
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,920
Yes, competition can be good for a marketplace, but is competition making the streaming service

121
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,480
industry any better, or is Netflix in the shitter and people are just pirating everything?

122
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,040
The one market state better for the consumer than rigorous competition is a monopoly where

123
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,400
the monopolizer still respects its audience and still manages to innovate.

124
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,760
This almost never happens, because human beings are pretty shitty, but it did happen with

125
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
Steam.

126
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Some of the kingly god-like Gabe Newell is, in part, a recognition that the stars actually

127
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,240
did align with Valve, and the Epic store is hated because their disruption means ruining

128
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
a good thing.

129
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,920
But our boy Randy doesn't really understand this.

130
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,880
He thinks it's all just gamers being crybabies or something.

131
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,680
Bitch and moan all you want, digital stores and PC are being unmonopolized.

132
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,960
What a galaxy brain to take.

133
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,400
Unmonopolize digital stores and PC by giving one digital store on PC a monopoly on your

134
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,200
game, in exchange for a fat check.

135
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,280
Couldn't unmonopolization mean putting it everywhere all at once, Randy?

136
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,000
Naturally, gamers weren't happy about this turn of events.

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,760
And naturally, the powers that be determined that the problem was the gamers and not Gearbox.

138
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,800
When average people have no way to protest, they turn to things like review bombing.

139
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,960
The recent escapades of sites like Rotten Tomatoes have shown us that the powers that

140
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,360
be don't like it when we object to their behavior in this manner.

141
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,540
So now negative reviews have simply become illegitimate.

142
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,960
You automatically lose all credibility for your argument when you stoop to this level.

143
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,680
Purposely trying to tank reviews of previous installments just because you don't like

144
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,160
the decision made for the new release is absurd.

145
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,080
This is mob mentality, not feedback.

146
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,920
I don't know, fuck epic seems to be pretty straightforward feedback to me.

147
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,600
But here's our guy Randy again.

148
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,000
Ironically that this misuse is possible and that Steam has no interest in correcting the

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,640
issue makes me kind of happy about 2K's decision and makes me want to reconsider Gearbox

150
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,020
Publishing's current posture on the platform.

151
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,660
Unfortunately for you, this isn't misuse.

152
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,700
This is protest.

153
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,340
You find it to be misuse because you are the target of the protest, Randy.

154
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,100
The privileged always feel like they're being oppressed whenever other people tell them

155
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,280
that they're wrong.

156
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,700
And of course, game journalists moved in lockstep with the rest of the establishment against

157
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:13,860
gamers and with the bizarrely pro-social justice, pro-socialism large corporations.

158
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,740
As I'm sure we've all expected them to do since 2014.

159
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,620
Confused Borderlands 3 players complain about game in wrong forum.

160
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,060
That's quite the headline about this situation.

161
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,460
LOL aren't gamers idiots, they can't get the forum right.

162
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,340
Oh, oh no.

163
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,800
Everyone knew exactly where it was they were posting.

164
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,660
The point is that they had nowhere else to post their criticism.

165
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,500
But admitting that would mean that you have to accept that Gearbox and Epic are in the

166
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
wrong.

167
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,300
And you're not about to do that, are you?

168
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,620
Uh oh, an 85 meta score on Metacritic with only a 3.8 user score.

169
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,820
Is Metacritic the problem too, Randy?

170
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,300
Let's read these reviews.

171
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,300
What a disaster.

172
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,300
Rushed.

173
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,780
Runs poor on a 2080 Ti.

174
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,340
Humor is the worst.

175
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,340
Epic store.

176
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,340
Microtransactions.

177
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,580
Social justice warriors.

178
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,140
It pronouns not they.

179
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,180
Looks like shit for a 2019 game.

180
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,180
Denuvo.

181
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,180
SJWs.

182
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,220
Hello to the banned people because of they.

183
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,220
Epic exclusive.

184
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,620
Okay, okay, what is this they stuff people are on about?

185
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,220
Intentionally misgendering a character could get you banned from Borderlands 3.

186
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,620
The character Flak uses they them pronouns.

187
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,060
Oh fuck.

188
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,900
Respect the pronouns, you bigot.

189
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,940
A moderator of the Borderlands 3 forum wrote in a post on August 12th that the character

190
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:31,860
Flak was written by a non-binary person and the company is asking forum posters to respect

191
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,620
the creator's wish that Flak be referred to with they slash them pronouns.

192
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:41,240
Honest mistakes will not result in a ban, the moderator said, but intentional misgendering

193
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,660
of the character will have consequences.

194
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,020
Here's the take of a voice actor from Borderlands 3.

195
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,780
Flak uses they them pronouns.

196
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,300
Flak uses they them pronouns.

197
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,460
Flak uses they them pronouns.

198
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,340
Flak uses they them pronouns.

199
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:59,060
Stop pushing your own ignorance and anxiety on LGBTQ game devs and gamers.

200
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,060
Smooch.

201
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,060
Ah.

202
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,420
I imagine it's legit difficult for playing what could be your first game without two

203
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,200
plus options for strictly male characters.

204
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,340
That can be legit scary.

205
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,180
But you aren't being erased, I swear.

206
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,260
Everyone has a place in this world.

207
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,380
We just want to give options to those who've never had them.

208
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:23,140
And if, after that, you still find yourself spitting mad, fuck you, it's 100% canon.

209
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,140
This really is how this type of thing goes every time, isn't it?

210
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,100
It's heaps of condescension with a thin layer of, we just want to give people options on

211
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
top.

212
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,100
It's like they know they're taking a shit all over everything.

213
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,280
They're like that bratty kid who cried to the teacher all the time, but when you're

214
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,880
getting the old talking to, they've stopped the fake tears and they're laughing silently

215
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,880
behind their back.

216
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,100
So let me get this straight, Flak is a robotic character who doesn't have a gender but

217
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,020
people have been using it to refer to them.

218
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:53,140
And well, the character's creator, who is a non-binary person, is just not very happy

219
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,140
about that.

220
00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:00,360
Yep, this obviously non-binary individual, Benjamin Jettleman, who was Flak and Moses

221
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,860
Design Daddy, there's just, there's nothing gendered about this person at all, is there?

222
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,060
Hello, this is fucking epic.

223
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,540
You miss gender, you get sniped, as it fucking should be.

224
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,460
Respect trans NB people or perish.

225
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,740
It's simple.

226
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,940
It's simple guys, except Benjamin is the proud NB he was always meant to be, or a Gearbox

227
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,420
hit squad will straight up fucking murder you.

228
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,380
Oh, did you think I was joking about the whole Gearbox hit squad thing?

229
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,220
No, they exist.

230
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,220
Really.

231
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,580
A YouTuber by the name of Supmato, whose channel revolved around Borderlands content for years,

232
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:40,020
who was a massive Borderlands superfan, who was one of those guys that would rewatch trailers

233
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,600
of Borderlands 3 like 50 times to find little tidbits of info in the background, or hidden

234
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,060
codes that might mean something since that's how Gearbox loves to run its marketing campaigns.

235
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,340
This dude found a Twitch channel hidden in Borderlands 3 promotional material used by

236
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:57,260
the Gearbox developers to test out parts of Borderlands 3's integrations.

237
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,380
Supmato used the content on this Twitch channel to make Borderlands 3 videos.

238
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,700
And guess what happened to him?

239
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:08,340
On April 29th, the official Borderlands YouTube channel posted the reveal of the Twitch extension

240
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,700
leading into the gameplay reveal, which we were all stoked about.

241
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,980
And the name of the testing accounts were exposed in that video, as we've now learned.

242
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,120
This wasn't found by me, it was also posted on various platforms like Reddit and other

243
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,460
social medias.

244
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,880
That's how it was brought to my attention.

245
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,020
So quite a few of us decided to follow these accounts because, well, simply put, we could.

246
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:36,720
Again, this was all very public, and it was shown to about 185,000 viewers at this point.

247
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,480
And the channel name appears at 052 on the video, when they demonstrated the super cool

248
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,600
integrations that they've been working on, where we can basically become bosses or do

249
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:55,380
the Moxie Mixer stuff, or in this case, actually win gear watching our favorite streamers.

250
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:00,940
So this actual Twitch account was linked to all of the other Twitch accounts.

251
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:06,040
They all just had names where it looked like somebody ran their hand across the keyboard.

252
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,720
We didn't know if it was coded messages like previous stuff, or if it was random.

253
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,720
I again had it brought to my attention elsewhere, and it was exciting.

254
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,120
It was absolutely exciting, and that's why we decided to check it out.

255
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,560
I'll say straight up that it was something we forgot about, but notifications on the

256
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,740
Twitch platform tipped us off on it.

257
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,700
On Thursday, July 25th, private investigators showed up to my home, trespassed on my private

258
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,800
property, and questioned me.

259
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,040
I was very tense, as many of you could imagine.

260
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,480
Having two people in suits you don't know show up to your home.

261
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,280
As lawyers, law enforcement, and family have said, I probably shouldn't have spoke to them,

262
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,760
but I did, because I don't feel I have anything to hide.

263
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,400
They questioned me about various things relating to my channel, the livestream that was discussed

264
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:00,080
on my channel, which we will get to later, and they told me they were from Take Two Interactive.

265
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,120
I later, after researching on LinkedIn, discovered that they were contracted by Take Two, and

266
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,760
that they have a private firm, where they do various things that private investigators

267
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
would do.

268
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,720
We discussed SteamDB, the Rainbow Rarity, which was found in the code by Kobe, and more.

269
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,040
I don't remember it all, because as I said it was tense, and I was definitely uneasy,

270
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,500
but I think we spoke for maybe 30 or 40 minutes.

271
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:30,640
After the PIs left within maybe 20 minutes, the Discord server was gone, it was terminated,

272
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,580
my account was terminated, and that account and server were terminated for, and I quote,

273
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,980
being involved in selling, promoting, or distributing cheats, hacked, or cracked accounts.

274
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,900
It says nothing about who claimed that this was going on, whether it was Discord or elsewhere.

275
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,420
Again, I won't assume who did it.

276
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,940
I will say that, of course, I haven't done those things, but I will say that the email

277
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,500
also appears to be very automated, so it's probably just a catch-all.

278
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,900
The 26th, I received seven copyright strikes, and one of them still stands.

279
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:09,540
I don't know how the others were revoked, I wondered if YouTube helped me out, or maybe

280
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,660
they were retracted, I don't know.

281
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,940
I don't have an answer for you, I'm not going to assume.

282
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,120
Now according to the YouTube rules, if you receive four strikes in three months, that's

283
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,640
it, and the channel is terminated, which I fully expected to happen, and it didn't.

284
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,920
As I said, some of the strikes vanished, so the channel stays for now.

285
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:36,560
These strikes were manually placed by 2K CMS, and the only one that remains is set to expire

286
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,040
at the end of October.

287
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,560
Yeah, Gearbox and 2K Games have absolutely no problem abusing YouTube's copyright system

288
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,080
to nuke somebody's account, but even worse than that, they have no problem sending hired

289
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,800
thugs to the guy's house to try and intimidate him.

290
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,880
Yeah, they actually did this.

291
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,880
Seriously, they admitted it publicly on the verge.

292
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:02,160
2K Games defends necessary actions against YouTuber who shared Borderlands 3 leaks.

293
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,680
Necessary actions?

294
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,400
Because you were stupid enough to reveal the name of a Twitch account you used to publicly

295
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,200
stream Borderlands 3 development, and your most die-hard fans were savvy enough to put

296
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,240
two and two together?

297
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,720
The action we've taken is the result of a 10 month investigation, and a history of this

298
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,120
creator profiting from breaking our policies, leaking confidential information about our

299
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,360
product, and infringing on our copyrights.

300
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,320
How about you go fuck yourself, 2K?

301
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,640
Nothing there had the assumption of confidentiality, not after you publicly released the Twitch

302
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,680
URL.

303
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,480
Everything used there was fair use, and you know it.

304
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,600
And most importantly of all, if you've done this whole 10 month investigation and found

305
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,200
that something was actually infringing, why didn't you file charges and take him to court?

306
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,000
Is it because you knew that none of your bullshit would actually stick?

307
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,280
So the only thing you could actually do was abuse YouTube DMCA takedowns and send some

308
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,920
hired goons over to his place to intimidate him?

309
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,880
You have the unmitigated gall to behave this poorly, and you expect people to consider

310
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,840
your massive overreach as necessary actions?

311
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Fuck you.

312
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,920
Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of 2K, has a history of pulling this kind of

313
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
stunt.

314
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,520
For example, when Grand Theft Auto V's modding scene was in full swing, Take-Two sent two

315
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,600
PIs to one modder's house in an effort to get him to stop.

316
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,680
So I just got a pair of PIs at my door claiming to be sent by Take-Two, handing me a phone

317
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,120
with a person somewhere in the UK or US or whatever to discuss how to cease my activities

318
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,460
with regard to Grand Theft Auto, that they know what happened before with Activision

319
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,880
and want not to get the lawyers involved at this time, however they have tested their

320
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,680
legal standing already and are quite certain of their point, and aren't willing to accept

321
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,340
any solution other than ceasing my activities.

322
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,720
In my opinion this is how this shitty sleazy company operates in general, and everyone

323
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,480
the chain, from Take-Two down to 2K all the way down to Gearbox, is some level of responsible

324
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,160
for this massive overreach.

325
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,680
Well at this point, Supmato's channel is gone.

326
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,840
He got hit with seven copyright strikes, as far as I can tell, and although he won a lot

327
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,400
of the appeals, he simply decided to leave YouTube.

328
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,400
I understand man, if you're watching this I hope you come back someday.

329
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,400
But even if this event were the only thing I had to talk about in this video, it would

330
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,380
be enough for me to never buy Borderlands 3, pirate it if I really wanted to play it,

331
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,200
until everybody involved in its creation to fuck right off.

332
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,720
And no offense to the guy, but I'm not Supmato.

333
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,360
This video won't be going anywhere.

334
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,920
If it goes down it'll be on my bit shoot.

335
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,560
No matter how many muscle-bound Eskimos Randy hires to march up to my snow-covered igloo

336
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,920
to give me the business.

337
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,280
Get fucked 2K.

338
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,080
But despite the relative success of the Boycott Borderlands 3 hashtag in support of Supmato,

339
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,560
Borderlands 3's launch has been going well.

340
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,120
Well kinda.

341
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,080
In terms of sales, sure, but there's a few strange issues cropping up around the game

342
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,080
itself.

343
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,040
Where are the cloud saves?

344
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,040
Oh.

345
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,720
It's just a switch in the Epic launcher, eh?

346
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,920
No problem, eh?

347
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,400
Stop wanting to turn on the cloud saves, eh?

348
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,880
Borderlands 3 PC players report losing their save data.

349
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,800
Many users seem to believe the issue lies in the cloud.

350
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,240
Multiple players on Twitter have reported problems after activating cloud saves that

351
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,560
then either wiped progress completely or reset to an earlier save point.

352
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,080
One fan tweeted Gearbox and Epic Games asking,

353
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,240
Is there a way to revert it back so I don't lose all the time and all the gear I've got?

354
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah, Borderlands 3 deleted my save.

355
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,480
Looks like I'll be starting over.

356
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,640
I'm guessing this is cloud save related.

357
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,640
PSA.

358
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,200
Do not turn on cloud saves.

359
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,280
Maybe that initial question of where are the cloud saves wasn't so much about, hey, does

360
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,600
this game have cloud saves, and more like, where the hell did my save file go?

361
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,720
And here's another question that's probably worth asking.

362
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,480
Where the hell did my bandwidth go?

363
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Flare 2V, a professional streamer, said,

364
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,640
My internet can't stream and also handle whatever of my personal data Borderlands 3 is uploading

365
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,640
in the background.

366
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,960
And take a look at his usage stats.

367
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,240
Holy shit, that has a lot of data being sent out by Borderlands 3.exe.

368
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,600
I mean, maybe it's all netplay stuff, right?

369
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,000
Well, let's talk to the people that cracked a Nuvo about what this could possibly be.

370
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,940
This guy understandably didn't want to have his name put out there, since he helped bypass

371
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,080
one of the most commonly used anti-piracy services.

372
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,200
But he has a lot to say about Borderlands 3.

373
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,180
The current Nuvo has been recoded from the ground up, and our leaked source code that

374
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,600
was used to circumvent Nuvo no longer works.

375
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,860
This latest version with Borderlands 3 is basically a virtual machine, but each time

376
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:25,440
you compile the game, it creates a new assembly language for the game, and a new JIT for it

377
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,440
too.

378
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,600
Makes it hard to crack.

379
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,560
People have to spend a bunch of time trying to map out what Nuvo instruction is, which

380
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,000
x86 instruction.

381
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,960
Couple that with the fact that the Borderlands 3 game binaries are usually encrypted, and

382
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,280
Nuvo itself unencrypts them on the fly, and now forcing a 10 second 2 mbit limit, where

383
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,600
any variation in this shuts off your game as tampering, it's hard.

384
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,660
It's VM protect, but good.

385
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,320
By the way, VM protect is basically a program that will run other programs on an emulated

386
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,040
computer with non-standard architecture.

387
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,200
Basically meaning that when you run a program, you don't actually run the program.

388
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,920
Your computer generates another computer inside of it, which the user, you, have limited access

389
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,960
to, and then runs the program on that faked computer.

390
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,800
This shit is so intrusive that it would lock up the mouse at random intervals outside of

391
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,260
the game due to it checking for unauthorized inputs when I tried injecting.

392
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,880
It has to be some kind of keylogging spyware in order to do this.

393
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,600
That will be super juicy if we can prove that kind of illegal content on keeping pirates

394
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,020
out at the expense of possible user data being mined.

395
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,680
Our current study of Borderlands 3 shows the only binary that is encrypted is the main

396
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
EXE.

397
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,200
This new version is indeed a stupidly bloated virtual machine.

398
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,040
The main EXE is estimated to be ten times larger than the DRM-free version.

399
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,920
The new challenge is how it phones home and gets its encryption keys.

400
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,160
It purely depends on your CPU, some sort of hash based off of it.

401
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,720
That's why earlier cracks had Intel and AMD specific versions.

402
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,640
This one seems to sign a unique key based on your hardware, possibly requiring a different

403
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,120
crack for each PC.

404
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,120
Shit's fucked until we bypass this and somehow make it universal.

405
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,120
Unlikely.

406
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,480
Here's the TLDR.

407
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,280
Borderlands 3 executable file is ten times larger than it needs to be, and all of that

408
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,500
extra stuff isn't the game, it's an application that emulates a virtual computer which then

409
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,500
runs the game.

410
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,240
This allows the game to strictly control what your PC does.

411
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,200
It records all of your PC's actions and inputs, and then sends that data back to Gearbox,

412
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,340
requiring 2MB per second of your internet bandwidth to do so.

413
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,200
And by the way, this is actually illegal, because secretly installing keyloggers onto

414
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,080
a PC is a criminal offence.

415
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,080
All of this is done to prevent piracy and send all of your computer's behaviors, actions

416
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,560
and data back to Gearbox, 2K or Epic.

417
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,720
This all sounds awful.

418
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,500
If there were only some kind of workaround, yeah I know you can pirate it, but what if

419
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,960
there were something completely legal that we could do?

420
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,860
I refunded Borderlands 3 and uninstalled it from the Epic Games Store, but found its install

421
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:47,320
directory and its executable is still there, and I can unfortunately continue to play Borderlands

422
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,920
3 even though it's gone.

423
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,480
Talk about sick DRM.

424
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:58,280
Okay, so the solution is, legally buy it, legally refund it, then keep playing it.

425
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,080
I mean, it's no different from the tired customer service clerk at Walmart taking a

426
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,840
refund but not actually checking to see that you didn't give the product back, because

427
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,440
they just don't give a shit anymore.

428
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,560
The problem is Walmarts, not yours.

429
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,480
If the Epic Games Store wants to behave like a sad minimum wage worker in their 60s who

430
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,160
has lost all hope for their life, I'm okay with that.

431
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,520
But you know, there has to be some benefit to playing Borderlands 3 legit, like having

432
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,520
access to all those microtransactions.

433
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,720
Wait a minute, I thought Randy Pitchford said there was no microtransactions in Borderlands

434
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,720
3.

435
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,760
We're working on the big campaign DLC and will probably also offer additional cosmetics,

436
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,600
just as we did with Borderlands 2.

437
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,720
What we will not do is free-to-play style microtransactions.

438
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,960
No premium currency, no loot boxes, etc.

439
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,920
Okay, okay, I get it Randy.

440
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,600
We'll have DLC campaigns for sale, but no microtransactions.

441
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,280
2K Games has sent a statement confirming that cosmetic items will be for sale in Borderlands

442
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,640
3.

443
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,640
Players will have the option to purchase certain cosmetic items like character, vehicle, and

444
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,840
weapon skins.

445
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,400
But none of these purchases will be considered pay-to-win or impacting the gameplay, like

446
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,000
weapons or actual gear.

447
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,800
Okay, so it's Randy's understanding of what a microtransaction is, not what all of our

448
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
understanding of what a microtransaction is.

449
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,980
I mean, Randy even says this in a twitter reply to the article.

450
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,720
Come on guys, shitty clickbait headline.

451
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,280
Literally seconds before I said that, I made it very clear we're going to be doing more

452
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,880
cosmetic stuff like we did in Borderlands 2.

453
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,400
You know I was talking about premium currency and loot boxes kind of stuff not being in

454
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
the game.

455
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,200
You know, there's a fair argument to be made here.

456
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,560
Loot boxes are pretty shitty.

457
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,000
I don't care if they contain only cosmetic stuff like in Overwatch, but if rolling the

458
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,040
dice is the only way to progress in the game, like with the whole Battlefront 2 controversy,

459
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,600
it makes the game unplayable.

460
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,680
At the same time, microtransactions don't just refer to loot boxes or other free-to-play

461
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
models, Randy.

462
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,560
A microtransaction is a tiny purchase within a game to get some in-game item.

463
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:47,680
Cosmetic or impactful, direct purchase or loot box, they're all microtransactions.

464
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,320
Buying skins or outfits or decals for vehicles, they're all microtransactions too.

465
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,240
And people are angry, Randy, because we yearn for a return to where cosmetics were earned

466
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,720
by completing side quests or achievements.

467
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,880
You know, like in Borderlands 2, where almost all the cosmetics dropped off bosses or were

468
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,880
the product of quests?

469
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,340
That's what people want games to be again, Randy, and you're part of the problem.

470
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,800
So Borderlands 3's launch is a dumpster fire, but the games media hasn't been talking

471
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
about it too much.

472
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,760
Instead, they've been publishing helpful guides on how to write comedy while still

473
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,260
being a proper male feminist.

474
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,120
Like PC Game N's Borderlands 3's sense of humor.

475
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
Be edgy.

476
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
Be funny.

477
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,120
Don't be cruel.

478
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,120
Don't be insensitive.

479
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,120
Maybe I sound like an old codger who just doesn't get it, but I don't think you

480
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,800
can be edgy without being cruel at least a little bit.

481
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,200
Every joke has to have a subject, and being the butt of the joke will always be at least

482
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,520
a little uncomfortable.

483
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,040
Part of being an adult is learning to laugh at yourself rather than lash out in a screeching

484
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,720
fit whenever you're made fun of.

485
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,720
If your comedy is any good, you will be at least slightly cruel to somebody.

486
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,960
A joke about somebody will be cruel to that somebody.

487
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,320
A rape joke will be cruel to the person telling the joke.

488
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,380
A pun will be cruel to the audience.

489
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:54,680
Comedy requires that somebody, somewhere and sometime end up with egg on their face.

490
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,940
If SJWs refuse to do this, then it's no wonder that almost all social justice comedy

491
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,560
is completely unwatchable.

492
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,800
But there's more to Gearbox than Borderlands 3.

493
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,680
Like, hey, Battleborn.

494
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,040
Battleborn was a game that basically went head to head with Overwatch and got absolutely

495
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,960
fucking annihilated.

496
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,440
Nobody played Battleborn.

497
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,880
Overwatch had millions of players at its height.

498
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,440
According to Steamcharts, Battleborn's all-time peak was 12,000 players.

499
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,080
It never broke that 1000 a month average again after its initial launch month, and never

500
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,440
made it above 100 again after August of 2017.

501
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,220
Gearbox is still paying to keep Battleborn servers running, but the average number of

502
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,040
players online at any one time in August of 2019 was just 13.2.

503
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,080
The game was meant to support a healthy update cycle like Overwatch, but 14 months after

504
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,480
launch, all updates stopped.

505
00:27:42,480 --> 00:28:09,880
It was a critical and financial failure for Gearbox.

506
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,080
Talk about fucking desperate, dude.

507
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,440
Also gamers filled that subreddit up with Overwatch porn just to spite Randy.

508
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,840
And I do mean spite him, because at the time of Randy's tweet, the subreddit was pretty

509
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,320
new and the vast majority of content on it was from one user.

510
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,960
Did Randy Pitchford create his own Battleborn porn in a desperate attempt to save his game?

511
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,840
I mean, there's no proof of it, but I like to think so.

512
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,600
Randy became particularly salty about this once it was discovered.

513
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,960
I was about to block you, but then I read your Twitter bio and realized you probably

514
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,400
need more love in your life.

515
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Thanks.

516
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,200
Wow, what the fuck, attacking somebody personally?

517
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,200
That's low, man.

518
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,920
You should embrace your failures and laugh at them.

519
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,920
You made a crappy game.

520
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
That's okay.

521
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,920
I was being sincere.

522
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,320
Also, fuck you for calling our game crappy.

523
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,320
We love our game.

524
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,320
We love our fans.

525
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,320
Randy.

526
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,320
What fans?

527
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,000
But okay, this is all just fun drama so far.

528
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,200
Let's get into the Gearbox fraud.

529
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
Want to do that?

530
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,720
Want to talk about the fraud, the millions of dollars stolen, the extreme incompetence?

531
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,560
Sega approached Gearbox to make Aliens Colonial Marines.

532
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,600
If you haven't played Aliens, it's a steaming pile of shit.

533
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,840
It looks like it was barely worked on, and that's because it was.

534
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,920
Aliens Colonial Marines.

535
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:19,480
Gearbox stole funds from Sega to make Borderlands 2 and Duke Nukem Forever.

536
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,480
An unnamed Sega staffer has revealed that Gearbox Software stole funds from Sega to

537
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,420
make Borderlands 2 and Duke Nukem Forever.

538
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:31,980
These funds were actually for Aliens Colonial Marines, but Gearbox betrayed Sega according

539
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,240
to the source.

540
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,440
Pitchford and Gearbox wanted to focus heavily on Duke Nukem Forever, but how would they

541
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,040
get the money to hire some of the 3D Realms team and even buy the intellectual property?

542
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,960
Sure, they made a lot from Borderlands, but guess where they got the money to fund Borderlands

543
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,200
in the first place?

544
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Yep.

545
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Sega.

546
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,800
So Gearbox essentially lied to Sega, mishandled funds, broke agreements and contractual obligations

547
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,920
to work on other projects, didn't want to work on a game they were contractually obligated

548
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,920
to work on, and gave it to another team.

549
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,180
Poor organization and direction on Aliens Colonial Marines.

550
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,720
Took on too many projects from different companies at once, and other things we may not even

551
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
know about.

552
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,480
Hell, part of me believes that Gearbox wanted this thing delayed as much as possible so

553
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,680
they could get more funding to embezzle from Sega.

554
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,640
Sega was looking to sue Gearbox, but since Gearbox shipped the product, they couldn't.

555
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,000
So what kind of game did we finally get?

556
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Oh.

557
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Oh no.

558
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,600
He's just a cute little alien guy, isn't he?

559
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,200
Aliens Colonial Marines was outsourced by Gearbox to another company, Timegate, and

560
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,420
some former Timegate employees decided to come forward as well and describe the situation

561
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,420
to Eurogamer.

562
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,460
Aliens Colonial Marines is heavily regarded as one of the biggest trainwrecks in gaming

563
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,460
history.

564
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,780
Criticisms have run rampant from its shoddy critical reception to gamers crying afoul

565
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,620
of its pre-release demo not being at all representative of the final product.

566
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,740
It became apparent that Gearbox had ignored the game for years.

567
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,300
According to three staffers, Gearbox had focused the vast majority of its efforts on Duke Nukem

568
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,640
Forever, Borderlands, and Borderlands 2.

569
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,120
There was obviously not four years of work done on the game, said one source.

570
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,640
Apparently what Gearbox gave Timegate was merely a collection of assets with little

571
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,600
rhyme or reason as to how it was all planned to come together.

572
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,000
A lot of assets just didn't seem like they fit there, the source noted.

573
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,320
Perhaps the biggest thing Timegate didn't have when it began developing the game was

574
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,500
a script.

575
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,720
According to three sources, narrative designers at Gearbox and Timegate were constantly writing

576
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,800
and rewriting the game, causing the designers to discard entire levels.

577
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,920
For a couple months, we were just kind of guessing, said one source.

578
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,780
It's really weird to work on a game when you don't have a basic idea of how things will

579
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,780
work.

580
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:36,620
They said many times through demo production, don't worry about performance, just make

581
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,900
it awesome, said one source.

582
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,420
There's a reason those demos were never really playable.

583
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:45,700
The game feels like it was made in nine months, said a source that worked on the project.

584
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,980
That's because it was.

585
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,460
And if you needed any more proof that Aliens Colonial Marines was a rushed backburner mess

586
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:57,500
of a project despite it being Gearbox's only financial lifeline from 2008 to 2013, a simple

587
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,680
typo in the code is responsible for the goofy behaviors of the aliens in the game.

588
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:08,120
As a user of moddb.com discovered, the biggest bug in the game is just one letter long.

589
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,040
Inside your game's configuration file is the following line of code.

590
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:19,160
Class remapping equals pkengame.pkensequenceact underscore attach xeno to tether, points at

591
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:23,720
pkengame.pkensequenceact underscore attach pawn to tether, except it doesn't actually

592
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,120
say attach pawn to tether.

593
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,560
It says attach pawn to T-ether.

594
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,280
The attach pawn to tether function controls the behavior of the enemies in the game, and

595
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:36,400
you fix this one typo, the game's enemies actually act like enemies and not puppets.

596
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,240
They had coded behavior for the aliens to stalk around the player, coordinate in groups,

597
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,880
patrol areas, attack from a flank, all kinds of cool stuff.

598
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,760
And none of it worked because they released the game without giving the code a second

599
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,760
pass.

600
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,440
As for Duke Nukem Forever, nobody expected that game to actually be good.

601
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,720
It was in development hell since 1999, and Gearbox picked up the project just to get

602
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,040
something out the door.

603
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,880
Yeah, yeah, they siphoned money meant to be used for Alien from Sega, but fine, whatever.

604
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,440
Duke Nukem Forever really wasn't Gearbox's fault.

605
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,360
They did the best they could with what they were given, and now they own the Duke Nukem

606
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,360
IP.

607
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,440
It seems like they don't really plan to use it, though.

608
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,000
New Duke Nukem game is highly unlikely, says Gearbox.

609
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,600
Like a washed up actor, Duke Nukem's future only has cameo appearances instead of starring

610
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600
roles.

611
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,720
If you ever wanted to pick a character that modern day Verifieds on Twitter would call

612
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,640
the most toxic of them all, Duke Nukem would be that guy.

613
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,120
He is the epitome of toxic masculinity, and that's the point.

614
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,080
He's an over-the-top caricature, and I've always been fun with laughing at the absurdity

615
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,560
of the Duke Nukem games.

616
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,940
And despite the previous article, Randy himself said on Twitter,

617
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:43,080
I owe a good part of my early career to the franchise and I love it.

618
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,400
But Duke needs a future, we'll take care of the past, but we need to do so in a way

619
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,480
that does not ruin the future.

620
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,120
What is that future?

621
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,680
I mean, there was a shitty cameo of a neutered Duke in Bulletstorm, but that's about it.

622
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,640
I could have sworn there was an interview with Randy Pitchford recently where he said

623
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,920
that he was glad that he owned the Duke Nukem franchise, because it's pure toxic masculinity,

624
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,800
it's harmful to gaming, and as long as he has his way, Duke will never come back.

625
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,720
But maybe I just imagined it, because I can't find it anymore.

626
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,100
Vice published something similar anyway.

627
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,980
How Duke Nukem can be saved for the 21st century, let's see.

628
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:20,040
But there's something different about this invasion, and it's nothing to do with the

629
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,800
aliens themselves.

630
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,660
This time, the women that Duke used to objectify are fighting back to, and this is where he

631
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,500
road to salvation begins.

632
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,380
Duke's still a condescending piece of shit, content to fight beside women in a purely

633
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,660
isn't-this-cute kind of way, but his allies are shown as equals.

634
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,420
When he tries it on, he gets shot down.

635
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:42,140
This is an essay on how a future Duke Nukem game should be all about how Duke realizes

636
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,140
that he's problematic.

637
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:47,360
Honestly, the worst part is, if Gearbox ever does make a new Duke game, it'll probably

638
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,360
be this.

639
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,980
So far, the picture painted is pretty clear.

640
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:55,380
Randy Pitchford has his pet project, Borderlands, and he's taken on other side projects in

641
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:58,380
order to fund his company while he works on the main thing.

642
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,120
That's fair, a lot of people do that.

643
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,020
But generally, it's expected that you actually produce your side projects and then use the

644
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:08,820
profit to create your main one, not just take the funding and run, leaving wreckage in your

645
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,820
wake.

646
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:15,460
Which makes it all the more surprising that, I think, the initial concept for Borderlands

647
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,640
was actually plagiarized.

648
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:23,280
The original version of Borderlands 1 looked a lot like a knockoff of Rage, which itself

649
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,400
was an extremely mediocre Playstation 3 shooter.

650
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,800
This video looks nothing like the Borderlands that eventually came out, but it is, in fact,

651
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,200
how the game originally looked.

652
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,240
And boy, does it look generic.

653
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,880
Gearbox knew their game was in trouble, and needed something to make itself stick out.

654
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,880
Here's some clips from a short film titled Code Hunters, made by Ben Hibben for MTV back

655
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,880
in 2006.

656
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,120
Does it remind you of anything?

657
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,580
Anything at all?

658
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:58,100
Is it somewhat similar to the opening sequence to the original Borderlands, perhaps?

659
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,220
Maybe some scenes in Borderlands were directly ripped off from Code Hunters, I don't know?

660
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:07,620
In an interview from 2012, Ben Hibben stated that he was contacted by Gearbox prior to

661
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,780
the redesign of the game back in 2008.

662
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,500
They asked me if I would be interested to direct or design some cutscenes for them.

663
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,900
We exchanged a few emails, but the project didn't materialize in the end.

664
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,260
I didn't think much of it at the time, until I saw the final game in 2009.

665
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:27,660
I have never created or designed anything for Gearbox or Borderlands.

666
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:32,580
Gearbox saw my work and decided to reproduce it, make it their own, without my help or

667
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,580
my consent.

668
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:37,260
The hardest part for me when this happened, was understanding why they wouldn't ask

669
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,260
me directly.

670
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,520
We were already talking about doing some work together, it made no sense.

671
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,740
I understand being inspired.

672
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,260
I understand giving homage.

673
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:49,940
But when that's the case, you're not generally calling up the guy to offer him a job, cutting

674
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:55,540
him off without warning, and then forging on ahead with your, for the time, unique style,

675
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:59,100
while remaining publicly silent and ignoring all questions about it.

676
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,600
In my opinion, if you're acting this way, you're probably not inspired.

677
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,060
You're probably embarrassed that you blatantly ripped somebody off who's more talented

678
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,060
than you are.

679
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,880
Okay, uh, is this everything?

680
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,100
Is that all you've got up that magician's sleeve of yours, Randy?

681
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:15,780
We've got the plagiarism, the misuse of funds, the incompetence, the illegal data-harvesting,

682
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,220
the brow-beating of your critics, the constant scum-bucket moves.

683
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,140
I think that's all the sins of Gearbox, right?

684
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,540
I mean, there couldn't be anything else, could there?

685
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,340
How much worse could it get?

686
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:31,980
Plaintiff Wade Callender, in his individual capacity and on behalf of The Hatch LLC, files

687
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:37,340
this original petition against Randell Pitchford II and Gearbox Software.

688
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:42,020
Randy Pitchford is a manipulative and morally bankrupt CEO who shamefully exploited his

689
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,960
oldest friend, a Texas attorney and military veteran named Wade Callender.

690
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:51,300
It was Randy himself who breached his duties by exploiting Gearbox employees and property

691
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,600
to fund Pitchford's private cravings.

692
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,700
For example, while Randy was denying employee raises predicated on low-cash reserves, Randy

693
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:04,260
secretly saddled Gearbox employees with the burden of repaying a private, personal $12

694
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:09,660
million dollar bonus that Randy Pitchford re-routed from Gearbox's publisher directly

695
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,820
to Randy's side entity, Pitchford Entertainment Media & Magic.

696
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:18,660
Gearbox was contacted in 2014 by someone who discovered a USB drive at a medieval times

697
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,140
restaurant in Dallas County, Texas.

698
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,320
Because the USB drive contained sensitive Gearbox corporate material, the Good Samaritan

699
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,800
rightly suspected that the USB drive belonged to a high-level Gearbox employee.

700
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,200
Upon hearing of the discovery of this drive, Pitchford declared the drive was his and requested

701
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,560
a prompt return.

702
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,260
While the drive was being recovered in Texas, Pitchford and Callender were in San Francisco

703
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,160
mediating yet another case in which Pitchford's conduct was front and center, the alien Colonial

704
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,680
Marines case.

705
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:51,440
Pending his return to Texas, Callender instructed Gearbox personnel in Texas to make a copy

706
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,240
of the USB drive to ensure that its contents could be verified and, if necessary, acted

707
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,240
upon.

708
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,620
Before Callender could review the USB drive's contents, Pitchford intervened by retrieving

709
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:06,940
the lost USB drive himself and ordering Gearbox personnel to destroy the copy that Callender

710
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,940
requested.

711
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:12,300
On information and belief, Randy Pitchford's USB drive contained much more than the sensitive

712
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:18,220
documents of Gearbox and its business partners like Take-Two Interactive, 2K Games, Sega,

713
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,540
Microsoft, Sony, and etc.

714
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:25,100
Upon information and belief, Randy Pitchford's USB drive also contained Randy Pitchford's

715
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,040
personal collection of underage pornography.

716
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,840
Upon information and belief, Pitchford's USB drive experience wasn't enough to deter

717
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:38,440
Randy Pitchford's mischief, as Pitchford subsequently siphoned Gearbox profits to fund

718
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,800
parties thrown by Pitchford and his wife at their home for their own personal benefit.

719
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,440
At these events, which Pitchford and his wife affectionately term peacock parties, adult

720
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,360
men have reportedly exposed themselves to minors to the amusement of Randy Pitchford.

721
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:01,660
In November of 2016, Pitchford informed Callender that he had reached a side deal with Take-Two

722
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,200
and 2K Games.

723
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,880
The deal, which Pitchford insisted upon concealing, afforded Randy Pitchford a personal, secretive

724
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,200
executive bonus of $12 million.

725
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,620
Because Pitchford agreed to have his private bonuses counted as advances upon the royalties

726
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:21,320
owed to Gearbox employees, those employees and their families won't receive any of

727
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:26,760
their profit shares until their work repays Randy's bonus to Take-Two.

728
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,640
Holy shit.

729
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,480
And here's a cryptic tweet from a former Gearbox vice president and voice of the Borderlands

730
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:39,400
character Claptrap, no longer under Randy's thumb, posted shortly after the lawsuit was

731
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
filed.

732
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,580
Yes, it's true.

733
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:47,820
On the December 22nd episode of the podcast The Piff Pod, Randy Pitchford appears to partially

734
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,580
validate Wade Callender's story.

735
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,240
He spends a good chunk of the time talking about how he likes to watch pornography labeled

736
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,040
barely legal, and how he was particularly mesmerized by a cam girl who once squirted

737
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,580
live for him, stating that she's a fucking magician.

738
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:06,300
Apparently Pitchford's interest in her was because, I guess, getting a woman off is a

739
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,460
magic trick in his eyes?

740
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,460
Yeesh.

741
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,220
I know Randy's a magician, but apparently not so much in bed.

742
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:17,220
The podcast's description states, be warned, this podcast is not for the faint-hearted,

743
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,940
as Randy gushes about his love of magic, or something like that.

744
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,500
Yeah, they knew what was up.

745
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,060
So some people are saying child porn.

746
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,700
Randy's saying barely legal porn, but no one's talking about those peacock parties.

747
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,980
Claptrap's voice actor said it was true, but he's also got some other things to say.

748
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:37,700
I was fine with moving on after Gearbox, but when my former boss starts mouthing off about

749
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:42,820
various aspects of my employment, including how highly compensated I was and how generous

750
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:46,180
he is, I feel obligated to correct the record.

751
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:50,540
I had a lot of mixed feelings when asked to reprise the role of Claptrap, but I put

752
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,060
our differences aside and did something cool for Borderlands fans.

753
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:59,500
I offered to do it for free, in exchange for past royalties owed, plus an apology for something

754
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,900
I've never spoken about before.

755
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:07,100
Randy physically assaulted me in the lobby of the Marriott Marquis at GDC 2017.

756
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,780
I think Randy's been on tilt for the last few years.

757
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,140
He's not the victim he portrays himself to be.

758
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,460
I blocked him a couple years ago for stalking.

759
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:20,340
As an aside, it seems a bit conspicuous that he chimed in on my salary, but didn't mention

760
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:24,060
anything about the $12 million he siphoned from the employee royalty pool.

761
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,340
Eddings later elaborated on the event.

762
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,980
He shoved the fuck out of me while I'm on the balls of my feet trying to whisper.

763
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,900
He knocked me back four steps.

764
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,980
I believe I caught him in a deception.

765
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:38,700
What's more is that Eddings says his claim can be backed up by one of two cooperative

766
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,900
witnesses, Gearbox co-founder Landon Montgomery.

767
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,300
Montgomery corroborates the assault allegations, saying,

768
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:49,260
David leaned up to whisper something to Randy and out of the blue Randy shoves him, hard.

769
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:53,820
Eddings also offered screenshots from a tirade of Snapchat messages he received from Pitchford

770
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:58,700
after the incident, with the CEO having demanded, who the fuck are you loyal to?

771
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,500
And jeering that Eddings' priorities are completely fucked.

772
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:07,740
Yeah, you know that bit in the final Borderlands 2 DLC where Claptrap, with a new voice actor,

773
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:29,620
begs Lilith for his job back?

774
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,620
Puts that in a whole new light, doesn't it?

775
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:34,620
But hey, you know what, it's all just okay.

776
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,900
It's all fine.

777
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,700
After all, Randy Pitchford's a little autistic, he's a little on the spectrum, so we have

778
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,700
to forgive him or that's ableist, right?

779
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,700
Right guys?

780
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:49,140
You can do whatever you want nowadays, peacock parties, physical assaults, potentially child

781
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:54,020
porn, losing private documents at a restaurant, embezzling funds, stealing money from your

782
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:58,780
employees, stealing money from your partners, intentionally delaying and tanking a game

783
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:02,700
in order to make way for your pet project, ripping off the only unique thing your pet

784
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:07,740
project has from somebody vastly more talented than you, loading up paying customers computers

785
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:12,720
with malware designed to monitor your usage and keylog everything you do and sell it all

786
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,740
off to the Epic Store to their Chinese state corporate overlords and physically intimidate

787
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,420
anyone who finds out about any of your rotten little schemes.

788
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,060
It's all fine if you're a little autistic.

789
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,940
Randy just doesn't know any better, you bigot.

790
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,540
Let's go all the way back to that initial post.

791
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,780
The one that was probably fake because the promised leak of Borderlands 3 never actually

792
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,780
came out.

793
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:36,300
Despite that, a lot of the stuff in it ultimately lined up, didn't it?

794
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,500
Randy Pitchford is confirmed by multiple people to be a control freak and a bully.

795
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,540
Multiple sources and stories show him to be exploiting his employees and shuffling money

796
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,500
around in an attempt to line his own pockets.

797
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,460
There's a chance he might even be a sexual abuser, too.

798
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:54,660
And Borderlands 3, now that it's out, pales in comparison to Borderlands 2 in nearly every

799
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,660
way.

800
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,740
I will never buy a game from these people again.

801
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:02,660
I will never recommend that people buy a game from these people again.

802
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:07,900
If I ever want to play Borderlands 3, or any other game made by this company, I will pirate

803
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,020
it.

804
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,940
If I ever want to stream it, I'll still pirate it.

805
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:16,340
I am done with just putting up with all of these shitty people ruining the great passion,

806
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,180
the one hobby, the community we've all shared for most of our lives now.

807
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,180
Fuck em.

808
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,500
I've got more videos kind of like this one in the works.

809
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,500
EA, maybe?

810
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,500
Blizzard?

811
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,500
Bethesda?

812
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,500
I don't know.

813
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,500
We'll see.

814
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,060
For the premiere of this video, I'll be over on my Twitch channel right now playing

815
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:37,400
a game made by a company that I think is probably one of the last ones out there that doesn't

816
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,800
shit the bed this badly.

817
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,700
It's the Link's Awakening remake on the Nintendo Switch.

818
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:47,980
Naomi and I are having a great time with it, so drop by twitch.tv slash Game Boomers and

819
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,980
say hi.

820
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:52,180
And if you're not watching this video on release day, that's okay.

821
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:55,780
Because I stream most nights on that Twitch anyway, so come give it a look.

822
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:56,780
I'll see you there.

823
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,380
I love you.
