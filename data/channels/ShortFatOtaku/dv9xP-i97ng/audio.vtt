00:00.000 --> 00:21.440
Borderlands 3 came out about a week ago, and it appears to be a rip-roaring success.

00:21.440 --> 00:26.360
Borderlands 3 has twice as many players as its predecessor, despite some performance

00:26.360 --> 00:28.080
issues and epic exclusivity.

00:28.240 --> 00:32.320
Yeah, just a few bugs, a launcher nobody likes, but no big deal, right?

00:32.320 --> 00:38.160
I mean, according to Randy Pitchford, Gearbox's CEO, the launch day peak concurrent players

00:38.160 --> 00:43.560
of Borderlands 3 is about twice as high as the all-time peak concurrent players of Borderlands

00:43.560 --> 00:44.560
2.

00:44.560 --> 00:45.640
That is quite impressive.

00:45.640 --> 00:49.160
So what's with my doom and gloom title, the collapse of Gearbox?

00:49.160 --> 00:52.520
Well first I would like to talk about the other part of the title, the indefensible

00:52.520 --> 00:53.520
bit.

00:53.520 --> 00:57.600
Indefensible began as a series on indie game devs and their corruption, back during Gamergate's

00:57.600 --> 00:58.600
relevance period.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.320
At this point though, I'm just going to use this series as a way to discuss corruption,

01:02.320 --> 01:06.640
cultural Marxism, and general cultural war BS in all of gaming, because Gamergate just

01:06.640 --> 01:10.960
isn't relevant anymore, and SFO's not primarily a gaming news channel, so I figured

01:10.960 --> 01:13.640
I'd just put all the gaming stuff under one tag, okay?

01:13.640 --> 01:19.440
Let's begin with what is unfortunately probably not true, although I wish it were, and I think

01:19.440 --> 01:21.840
there are some portions that might be.

01:21.840 --> 01:26.280
This post started floating around shortly after the Epic Games Store exclusivity deal

01:26.280 --> 01:28.080
for Borderlands 3 went public.

01:28.080 --> 01:31.480
I've messaged what I'm about to say to several YouTubers as protests for the Epic

01:31.480 --> 01:35.440
Games exclusive deal, so now I'm telling you all here in case they twist what I said.

01:35.440 --> 01:39.020
Randy Pitchford is on Twitter right now taking the high ground as if he had nothing to do

01:39.020 --> 01:40.020
with it.

01:40.020 --> 01:44.300
Our publisher had no interest in Epic exclusive until Randy pushed it and convinced them to

01:44.300 --> 01:47.180
do it all because he wants a bigger bonus that he didn't earn.

01:47.180 --> 01:49.800
He screams and yells at us over the smallest thing.

01:49.800 --> 01:53.280
He's a big bully almost, and you can see that if you watch the press conference with

01:53.280 --> 01:55.320
how nervous the others look next to him.

01:55.360 --> 01:59.600
Well, here's that press conference, and Randy does look all sunshine and rainbows,

01:59.600 --> 02:03.120
but oh boy, that is a crowd of unhappy people behind him.

02:03.120 --> 02:09.080
They look like they know if they say one wrong thing, make one wrong move, their ass is grass.

02:09.080 --> 02:13.160
Borderlands 3, by Randy's choice, is pushing online multiplayer hardcore over the story.

02:13.160 --> 02:17.440
We legitimately have our 15 hour campaign done and ready to go, but are forced to make

02:17.440 --> 02:20.580
at least 50 hours of online stuff for launch.

02:20.580 --> 02:24.100
Everything you love about Borderlands 1 and 2 is non-existent in 3.

02:24.100 --> 02:28.240
As a side note, people are generally saying that the writing has gone downhill tremendously

02:28.240 --> 02:32.320
between Borderlands 2 and 3, especially with the characterization of the game's main villains

02:32.320 --> 02:37.100
as religious cult leaders and the heroes playing some kind of edgy atheist pluses.

02:37.100 --> 02:41.220
I guess Randy played Far Cry 5 or Iconoclasts and thought that's what Borderlands 3 should

02:41.220 --> 02:42.220
be.

02:42.220 --> 02:45.460
At the same time, those villainous twins are also live streamers, and their broadcasts

02:45.460 --> 02:48.580
throughout the game are half Twitch stream, half sermon.

02:48.580 --> 02:50.740
And I'm not an idiot, the commentary is clear.

02:50.740 --> 02:54.820
Old media has always hated new media, and as a sub-feud of that, game developers have

02:54.820 --> 02:59.740
always hated YouTubers and streamers, because generally, unlike games journalists, we're

02:59.740 --> 03:00.740
not as corrupt.

03:00.740 --> 03:04.060
You'd be hard-pressed to find a YouTuber willing to be bought to make a fake review

03:04.060 --> 03:08.860
for a game, and when those few YouTubers have done it, it almost always comes out and their

03:08.860 --> 03:11.280
audience almost always drags them for it.

03:11.280 --> 03:15.580
If you've got pent-up disdain for somebody for being both more popular than you, as well

03:15.580 --> 03:19.820
as not answering to your power structure, Borderlands 3 is generally the story you'd

03:19.900 --> 03:23.380
Also, it's quite the feat that the writing's worse than Borderlands 2, considering that

03:23.380 --> 03:26.700
Borderlands 2's writing was absolutely abominable.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.380
Don't tell Angry Joe that, though.

03:28.380 --> 03:31.940
Yes, this is a real screencap from his Borderlands 2 video.

03:31.940 --> 03:33.380
Let's get back to it, though.

03:33.380 --> 03:37.240
After the Epic exclusive was confirmed inside the studio, we were told we were not allowed

03:37.240 --> 03:40.780
to talk about the issues of the platform on our personal Twitters or anything.

03:40.780 --> 03:43.220
I decided to try and confirm this.

03:43.220 --> 03:46.820
Here is a list of the Twitter accounts of Gearbox employees.

03:46.820 --> 03:51.460
This list obviously isn't exhaustive, as Gearbox has hundreds of employees working

03:51.460 --> 03:55.580
for them, but these are the people who listed their position at Gearbox in their bio, all

03:55.580 --> 03:59.180
of whom can be confirmed by both LinkedIn accounts as well as their names appearing

03:59.180 --> 04:01.780
in the credits of various Gearbox games.

04:01.780 --> 04:05.740
Almost none of them have mentioned Epic Games on Twitter, and the few that have do so in

04:05.740 --> 04:08.100
a universally positive light.

04:08.100 --> 04:11.200
Of course, this doesn't necessarily prove that they're banned from talking negatively

04:11.200 --> 04:13.980
about Epic, only that they haven't done so.

04:14.180 --> 04:17.340
It's entirely possible that they all actually like Epic on their own.

04:17.340 --> 04:21.700
It's also entirely possible that Gearbox company policy is that you're just not allowed

04:21.700 --> 04:24.340
to talk about anything controversial at all.

04:24.340 --> 04:26.540
Unless it's Donald Trump, anyway.

04:26.540 --> 04:31.220
A good chunk of the accounts I looked at had their share of Orange Man bad tweets, so maybe

04:31.220 --> 04:33.380
the rule only swings one way.

04:33.380 --> 04:37.680
But here's why I think this is probably a fake, at least somewhat.

04:37.680 --> 04:41.220
As Rebellion, we've stolen a build of the game and will upload to the Pirate Bay if

04:41.220 --> 04:44.220
our demands are not met in 4 weeks.

04:44.220 --> 04:49.900
We want no Epic exclusive, we want better working conditions, we want 40 hour work weeks,

04:49.900 --> 04:54.060
we want Randy Pitchford to take anger management classes, and we want to beat Gearbox 2009

04:54.060 --> 04:55.060
again.

04:55.060 --> 04:58.400
As far as I can tell, the game never did get uploaded to the Pirate Bay, at least not within

04:58.400 --> 05:01.340
this time frame, and I'm pretty sure none of the demands ever got met.

05:01.340 --> 05:05.800
However, it is possible that this post was written by a disgruntled Gearbox employee,

05:05.800 --> 05:08.380
because a lot of other things about it do line up.

05:08.380 --> 05:11.780
For example, Randy Pitchford did indeed take to Twitter to give the Epic Games Store a

05:11.780 --> 05:13.500
very public blowjob.

05:13.500 --> 05:17.820
My expectation is that Epic's investment in technology will outpace Valve substantially.

05:17.820 --> 05:22.380
When we look back at Steam in 5 or 10 years, it may look like a dying store and other,

05:22.380 --> 05:24.700
more competitive stores will be the place to be.

05:24.700 --> 05:29.100
The competitive store that happens to be the leader in 10 years may not be Epic's store,

05:29.100 --> 05:33.220
but it probably won't be Valve's, and Epic's moves right now are opening the door and paving

05:33.220 --> 05:35.860
the way for a vibrant, competitive economy.

05:35.860 --> 05:39.260
Epic is the forcing function that is going to make all this happen.

05:39.260 --> 05:43.180
It's really incredible, but they are the only guys who can really come along to disrupt Steam's

05:43.180 --> 05:45.680
monopoly and help all this get fixed.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.500
They will bring balance to the force.

05:47.500 --> 05:51.880
There has been an intense hatred of Valve and Steam on the social justice side of game

05:51.880 --> 05:53.180
development for a while now.

05:53.180 --> 05:57.180
As soon as Steam allowed anyone to publish their game, regardless of content, as long

05:57.180 --> 06:01.880
as it wasn't a virus or something, game journalists lost their mind at the idea that a major tech

06:01.880 --> 06:06.280
company was not going to censor its users or products on their behalf.

06:06.280 --> 06:11.240
Valve, the owner of Steam, is also not publicly traded, so Chinese state corporations like

06:11.240 --> 06:15.760
Tencent can't buy their way into Steam's pockets the way they did with the Epic game

06:15.760 --> 06:16.760
store.

06:16.760 --> 06:20.720
Steam also refuses to implement service-wide algorithms to make curated content bubble

06:20.720 --> 06:25.280
to the surface of everyone's feeds, another quality that SJWs find objectionable because

06:25.280 --> 06:30.320
they're so used to the false inflation that services like YouTube and Facebook give them.

06:30.320 --> 06:34.440
Instead, Steam displays items that are on sale prominently, and gives you a generated

06:34.440 --> 06:39.080
list of games it thinks you may like based on the games you've recently played, which

06:39.080 --> 06:42.920
unlike YouTube or Facebook's algorithms can actually be disabled.

06:42.920 --> 06:47.760
That's the extent that Steam pushes content onto its users, and today's techy authoritarians

06:47.760 --> 06:49.480
find this unacceptable.

06:49.480 --> 06:52.880
So unacceptable that they'd rather jump into bed with the Epic game store and all

06:52.880 --> 06:54.160
of its huge flaws.

06:54.160 --> 06:59.440
In this larger game, Randy Pitchford is the fall man, the sap who has to explain his company's

06:59.440 --> 07:00.800
selling out to his own install base.

07:00.800 --> 07:04.240
I think I have a slightly different view on monopolies than most people.

07:04.240 --> 07:08.920
Yes, competition can be good for a marketplace, but is competition making the streaming service

07:08.920 --> 07:13.480
industry any better, or is Netflix in the shitter and people are just pirating everything?

07:13.480 --> 07:18.040
The one market state better for the consumer than rigorous competition is a monopoly where

07:18.040 --> 07:22.400
the monopolizer still respects its audience and still manages to innovate.

07:22.400 --> 07:26.760
This almost never happens, because human beings are pretty shitty, but it did happen with

07:26.760 --> 07:27.760
Steam.

07:27.760 --> 07:32.760
Some of the kingly god-like Gabe Newell is, in part, a recognition that the stars actually

07:32.760 --> 07:37.240
did align with Valve, and the Epic store is hated because their disruption means ruining

07:37.240 --> 07:38.240
a good thing.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.920
But our boy Randy doesn't really understand this.

07:40.920 --> 07:43.880
He thinks it's all just gamers being crybabies or something.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.680
Bitch and moan all you want, digital stores and PC are being unmonopolized.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.960
What a galaxy brain to take.

07:49.960 --> 07:54.400
Unmonopolize digital stores and PC by giving one digital store on PC a monopoly on your

07:54.400 --> 07:56.200
game, in exchange for a fat check.

07:56.200 --> 08:00.280
Couldn't unmonopolization mean putting it everywhere all at once, Randy?

08:00.280 --> 08:03.000
Naturally, gamers weren't happy about this turn of events.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.760
And naturally, the powers that be determined that the problem was the gamers and not Gearbox.

08:07.760 --> 08:11.800
When average people have no way to protest, they turn to things like review bombing.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.960
The recent escapades of sites like Rotten Tomatoes have shown us that the powers that

08:14.960 --> 08:18.360
be don't like it when we object to their behavior in this manner.

08:18.360 --> 08:21.540
So now negative reviews have simply become illegitimate.

08:21.540 --> 08:25.960
You automatically lose all credibility for your argument when you stoop to this level.

08:25.960 --> 08:29.680
Purposely trying to tank reviews of previous installments just because you don't like

08:29.680 --> 08:32.160
the decision made for the new release is absurd.

08:32.160 --> 08:34.080
This is mob mentality, not feedback.

08:34.080 --> 08:37.920
I don't know, fuck epic seems to be pretty straightforward feedback to me.

08:37.920 --> 08:39.600
But here's our guy Randy again.

08:39.600 --> 08:44.000
Ironically that this misuse is possible and that Steam has no interest in correcting the

08:44.000 --> 08:48.640
issue makes me kind of happy about 2K's decision and makes me want to reconsider Gearbox

08:48.640 --> 08:51.020
Publishing's current posture on the platform.

08:51.020 --> 08:53.660
Unfortunately for you, this isn't misuse.

08:53.660 --> 08:54.700
This is protest.

08:54.700 --> 08:58.340
You find it to be misuse because you are the target of the protest, Randy.

08:58.340 --> 09:02.100
The privileged always feel like they're being oppressed whenever other people tell them

09:02.100 --> 09:03.280
that they're wrong.

09:03.280 --> 09:07.700
And of course, game journalists moved in lockstep with the rest of the establishment against

09:07.700 --> 09:13.860
gamers and with the bizarrely pro-social justice, pro-socialism large corporations.

09:13.860 --> 09:16.740
As I'm sure we've all expected them to do since 2014.

09:16.740 --> 09:21.620
Confused Borderlands 3 players complain about game in wrong forum.

09:21.620 --> 09:24.060
That's quite the headline about this situation.

09:24.060 --> 09:27.460
LOL aren't gamers idiots, they can't get the forum right.

09:27.460 --> 09:29.340
Oh, oh no.

09:29.340 --> 09:31.800
Everyone knew exactly where it was they were posting.

09:31.800 --> 09:34.660
The point is that they had nowhere else to post their criticism.

09:34.660 --> 09:37.500
But admitting that would mean that you have to accept that Gearbox and Epic are in the

09:37.500 --> 09:38.500
wrong.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.300
And you're not about to do that, are you?

09:40.300 --> 09:45.620
Uh oh, an 85 meta score on Metacritic with only a 3.8 user score.

09:45.620 --> 09:47.820
Is Metacritic the problem too, Randy?

09:47.820 --> 09:49.300
Let's read these reviews.

09:49.300 --> 09:50.300
What a disaster.

09:50.300 --> 09:51.300
Rushed.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.780
Runs poor on a 2080 Ti.

09:52.780 --> 09:54.340
Humor is the worst.

09:54.340 --> 09:55.340
Epic store.

09:55.340 --> 09:56.340
Microtransactions.

09:56.340 --> 09:57.580
Social justice warriors.

09:57.580 --> 09:59.140
It pronouns not they.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.180
Looks like shit for a 2019 game.

10:01.180 --> 10:02.180
Denuvo.

10:02.180 --> 10:03.180
SJWs.

10:03.180 --> 10:05.220
Hello to the banned people because of they.

10:05.220 --> 10:06.220
Epic exclusive.

10:06.220 --> 10:09.620
Okay, okay, what is this they stuff people are on about?

10:09.620 --> 10:14.220
Intentionally misgendering a character could get you banned from Borderlands 3.

10:14.220 --> 10:17.620
The character Flak uses they them pronouns.

10:17.620 --> 10:19.060
Oh fuck.

10:19.060 --> 10:20.900
Respect the pronouns, you bigot.

10:20.900 --> 10:25.940
A moderator of the Borderlands 3 forum wrote in a post on August 12th that the character

10:25.940 --> 10:31.860
Flak was written by a non-binary person and the company is asking forum posters to respect

10:31.860 --> 10:36.620
the creator's wish that Flak be referred to with they slash them pronouns.

10:36.620 --> 10:41.240
Honest mistakes will not result in a ban, the moderator said, but intentional misgendering

10:41.240 --> 10:43.660
of the character will have consequences.

10:43.660 --> 10:47.020
Here's the take of a voice actor from Borderlands 3.

10:47.020 --> 10:48.780
Flak uses they them pronouns.

10:48.780 --> 10:50.300
Flak uses they them pronouns.

10:50.300 --> 10:52.460
Flak uses they them pronouns.

10:52.460 --> 10:54.340
Flak uses they them pronouns.

10:54.340 --> 10:59.060
Stop pushing your own ignorance and anxiety on LGBTQ game devs and gamers.

10:59.060 --> 11:00.060
Smooch.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.060
Ah.

11:01.060 --> 11:05.420
I imagine it's legit difficult for playing what could be your first game without two

11:05.420 --> 11:08.200
plus options for strictly male characters.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.340
That can be legit scary.

11:10.340 --> 11:12.180
But you aren't being erased, I swear.

11:12.180 --> 11:14.260
Everyone has a place in this world.

11:14.260 --> 11:17.380
We just want to give options to those who've never had them.

11:17.380 --> 11:23.140
And if, after that, you still find yourself spitting mad, fuck you, it's 100% canon.

11:23.140 --> 11:26.140
This really is how this type of thing goes every time, isn't it?

11:26.140 --> 11:30.100
It's heaps of condescension with a thin layer of, we just want to give people options on

11:30.100 --> 11:31.100
top.

11:31.100 --> 11:33.100
It's like they know they're taking a shit all over everything.

11:33.100 --> 11:36.280
They're like that bratty kid who cried to the teacher all the time, but when you're

11:36.280 --> 11:39.880
getting the old talking to, they've stopped the fake tears and they're laughing silently

11:39.880 --> 11:40.880
behind their back.

11:40.880 --> 11:45.100
So let me get this straight, Flak is a robotic character who doesn't have a gender but

11:45.100 --> 11:48.020
people have been using it to refer to them.

11:48.020 --> 11:53.140
And well, the character's creator, who is a non-binary person, is just not very happy

11:53.140 --> 11:54.140
about that.

11:54.140 --> 12:00.360
Yep, this obviously non-binary individual, Benjamin Jettleman, who was Flak and Moses

12:00.360 --> 12:05.860
Design Daddy, there's just, there's nothing gendered about this person at all, is there?

12:05.860 --> 12:08.060
Hello, this is fucking epic.

12:08.060 --> 12:11.540
You miss gender, you get sniped, as it fucking should be.

12:11.540 --> 12:14.460
Respect trans NB people or perish.

12:14.460 --> 12:15.740
It's simple.

12:15.740 --> 12:20.940
It's simple guys, except Benjamin is the proud NB he was always meant to be, or a Gearbox

12:20.940 --> 12:23.420
hit squad will straight up fucking murder you.

12:23.420 --> 12:27.380
Oh, did you think I was joking about the whole Gearbox hit squad thing?

12:27.380 --> 12:29.220
No, they exist.

12:29.220 --> 12:30.220
Really.

12:30.220 --> 12:35.580
A YouTuber by the name of Supmato, whose channel revolved around Borderlands content for years,

12:35.580 --> 12:40.020
who was a massive Borderlands superfan, who was one of those guys that would rewatch trailers

12:40.020 --> 12:44.600
of Borderlands 3 like 50 times to find little tidbits of info in the background, or hidden

12:44.600 --> 12:49.060
codes that might mean something since that's how Gearbox loves to run its marketing campaigns.

12:49.060 --> 12:53.340
This dude found a Twitch channel hidden in Borderlands 3 promotional material used by

12:53.340 --> 12:57.260
the Gearbox developers to test out parts of Borderlands 3's integrations.

12:57.260 --> 13:01.380
Supmato used the content on this Twitch channel to make Borderlands 3 videos.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.700
And guess what happened to him?

13:02.700 --> 13:08.340
On April 29th, the official Borderlands YouTube channel posted the reveal of the Twitch extension

13:08.340 --> 13:12.700
leading into the gameplay reveal, which we were all stoked about.

13:12.700 --> 13:17.980
And the name of the testing accounts were exposed in that video, as we've now learned.

13:17.980 --> 13:22.120
This wasn't found by me, it was also posted on various platforms like Reddit and other

13:22.120 --> 13:23.460
social medias.

13:23.460 --> 13:25.880
That's how it was brought to my attention.

13:25.880 --> 13:31.020
So quite a few of us decided to follow these accounts because, well, simply put, we could.

13:31.020 --> 13:36.720
Again, this was all very public, and it was shown to about 185,000 viewers at this point.

13:36.720 --> 13:43.480
And the channel name appears at 052 on the video, when they demonstrated the super cool

13:43.480 --> 13:48.600
integrations that they've been working on, where we can basically become bosses or do

13:48.600 --> 13:55.380
the Moxie Mixer stuff, or in this case, actually win gear watching our favorite streamers.

13:55.380 --> 14:00.940
So this actual Twitch account was linked to all of the other Twitch accounts.

14:00.940 --> 14:06.040
They all just had names where it looked like somebody ran their hand across the keyboard.

14:06.040 --> 14:10.720
We didn't know if it was coded messages like previous stuff, or if it was random.

14:10.720 --> 14:16.720
I again had it brought to my attention elsewhere, and it was exciting.

14:16.720 --> 14:20.120
It was absolutely exciting, and that's why we decided to check it out.

14:20.120 --> 14:24.560
I'll say straight up that it was something we forgot about, but notifications on the

14:24.560 --> 14:27.740
Twitch platform tipped us off on it.

14:27.740 --> 14:32.700
On Thursday, July 25th, private investigators showed up to my home, trespassed on my private

14:32.700 --> 14:34.800
property, and questioned me.

14:34.800 --> 14:38.040
I was very tense, as many of you could imagine.

14:38.040 --> 14:41.480
Having two people in suits you don't know show up to your home.

14:41.480 --> 14:46.280
As lawyers, law enforcement, and family have said, I probably shouldn't have spoke to them,

14:46.280 --> 14:49.760
but I did, because I don't feel I have anything to hide.

14:49.760 --> 14:54.400
They questioned me about various things relating to my channel, the livestream that was discussed

14:54.400 --> 15:00.080
on my channel, which we will get to later, and they told me they were from Take Two Interactive.

15:00.080 --> 15:05.120
I later, after researching on LinkedIn, discovered that they were contracted by Take Two, and

15:05.120 --> 15:09.760
that they have a private firm, where they do various things that private investigators

15:09.760 --> 15:10.760
would do.

15:10.760 --> 15:15.720
We discussed SteamDB, the Rainbow Rarity, which was found in the code by Kobe, and more.

15:15.720 --> 15:21.040
I don't remember it all, because as I said it was tense, and I was definitely uneasy,

15:21.040 --> 15:24.500
but I think we spoke for maybe 30 or 40 minutes.

15:24.500 --> 15:30.640
After the PIs left within maybe 20 minutes, the Discord server was gone, it was terminated,

15:30.640 --> 15:36.580
my account was terminated, and that account and server were terminated for, and I quote,

15:36.580 --> 15:41.980
being involved in selling, promoting, or distributing cheats, hacked, or cracked accounts.

15:41.980 --> 15:46.900
It says nothing about who claimed that this was going on, whether it was Discord or elsewhere.

15:46.900 --> 15:49.420
Again, I won't assume who did it.

15:49.420 --> 15:53.940
I will say that, of course, I haven't done those things, but I will say that the email

15:53.940 --> 15:58.500
also appears to be very automated, so it's probably just a catch-all.

15:58.500 --> 16:03.900
The 26th, I received seven copyright strikes, and one of them still stands.

16:03.900 --> 16:09.540
I don't know how the others were revoked, I wondered if YouTube helped me out, or maybe

16:09.540 --> 16:11.660
they were retracted, I don't know.

16:11.660 --> 16:14.940
I don't have an answer for you, I'm not going to assume.

16:14.940 --> 16:19.120
Now according to the YouTube rules, if you receive four strikes in three months, that's

16:19.120 --> 16:25.640
it, and the channel is terminated, which I fully expected to happen, and it didn't.

16:25.640 --> 16:29.920
As I said, some of the strikes vanished, so the channel stays for now.

16:29.920 --> 16:36.560
These strikes were manually placed by 2K CMS, and the only one that remains is set to expire

16:36.560 --> 16:38.040
at the end of October.

16:38.040 --> 16:43.560
Yeah, Gearbox and 2K Games have absolutely no problem abusing YouTube's copyright system

16:43.560 --> 16:48.080
to nuke somebody's account, but even worse than that, they have no problem sending hired

16:48.080 --> 16:50.800
thugs to the guy's house to try and intimidate him.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.880
Yeah, they actually did this.

16:52.880 --> 16:55.880
Seriously, they admitted it publicly on the verge.

16:55.880 --> 17:02.160
2K Games defends necessary actions against YouTuber who shared Borderlands 3 leaks.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.680
Necessary actions?

17:03.680 --> 17:07.400
Because you were stupid enough to reveal the name of a Twitch account you used to publicly

17:07.400 --> 17:11.200
stream Borderlands 3 development, and your most die-hard fans were savvy enough to put

17:11.200 --> 17:12.240
two and two together?

17:12.240 --> 17:16.720
The action we've taken is the result of a 10 month investigation, and a history of this

17:16.720 --> 17:21.120
creator profiting from breaking our policies, leaking confidential information about our

17:21.120 --> 17:24.360
product, and infringing on our copyrights.

17:24.360 --> 17:26.320
How about you go fuck yourself, 2K?

17:26.320 --> 17:30.640
Nothing there had the assumption of confidentiality, not after you publicly released the Twitch

17:30.640 --> 17:31.680
URL.

17:31.680 --> 17:34.480
Everything used there was fair use, and you know it.

17:34.480 --> 17:38.600
And most importantly of all, if you've done this whole 10 month investigation and found

17:38.600 --> 17:43.200
that something was actually infringing, why didn't you file charges and take him to court?

17:43.200 --> 17:46.000
Is it because you knew that none of your bullshit would actually stick?

17:46.000 --> 17:50.280
So the only thing you could actually do was abuse YouTube DMCA takedowns and send some

17:50.280 --> 17:52.920
hired goons over to his place to intimidate him?

17:52.920 --> 17:56.880
You have the unmitigated gall to behave this poorly, and you expect people to consider

17:56.880 --> 17:59.840
your massive overreach as necessary actions?

17:59.840 --> 18:00.840
Fuck you.

18:00.840 --> 18:05.920
Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of 2K, has a history of pulling this kind of

18:05.920 --> 18:06.920
stunt.

18:06.920 --> 18:11.520
For example, when Grand Theft Auto V's modding scene was in full swing, Take-Two sent two

18:11.520 --> 18:14.600
PIs to one modder's house in an effort to get him to stop.

18:14.600 --> 18:18.680
So I just got a pair of PIs at my door claiming to be sent by Take-Two, handing me a phone

18:18.680 --> 18:23.120
with a person somewhere in the UK or US or whatever to discuss how to cease my activities

18:23.120 --> 18:26.460
with regard to Grand Theft Auto, that they know what happened before with Activision

18:26.460 --> 18:29.880
and want not to get the lawyers involved at this time, however they have tested their

18:29.880 --> 18:33.680
legal standing already and are quite certain of their point, and aren't willing to accept

18:33.680 --> 18:36.340
any solution other than ceasing my activities.

18:36.340 --> 18:40.720
In my opinion this is how this shitty sleazy company operates in general, and everyone

18:40.720 --> 18:45.480
the chain, from Take-Two down to 2K all the way down to Gearbox, is some level of responsible

18:45.480 --> 18:47.160
for this massive overreach.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.680
Well at this point, Supmato's channel is gone.

18:49.680 --> 18:53.840
He got hit with seven copyright strikes, as far as I can tell, and although he won a lot

18:53.840 --> 18:56.400
of the appeals, he simply decided to leave YouTube.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.400
I understand man, if you're watching this I hope you come back someday.

18:59.400 --> 19:03.400
But even if this event were the only thing I had to talk about in this video, it would

19:03.400 --> 19:07.380
be enough for me to never buy Borderlands 3, pirate it if I really wanted to play it,

19:07.380 --> 19:10.200
until everybody involved in its creation to fuck right off.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.720
And no offense to the guy, but I'm not Supmato.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.360
This video won't be going anywhere.

19:14.360 --> 19:15.920
If it goes down it'll be on my bit shoot.

19:15.920 --> 19:20.560
No matter how many muscle-bound Eskimos Randy hires to march up to my snow-covered igloo

19:20.560 --> 19:21.920
to give me the business.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.280
Get fucked 2K.

19:23.280 --> 19:28.080
But despite the relative success of the Boycott Borderlands 3 hashtag in support of Supmato,

19:28.080 --> 19:30.560
Borderlands 3's launch has been going well.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.120
Well kinda.

19:32.120 --> 19:36.080
In terms of sales, sure, but there's a few strange issues cropping up around the game

19:36.080 --> 19:37.080
itself.

19:37.080 --> 19:39.040
Where are the cloud saves?

19:40.040 --> 19:41.040
Oh.

19:41.040 --> 19:43.720
It's just a switch in the Epic launcher, eh?

19:43.720 --> 19:44.920
No problem, eh?

19:44.920 --> 19:47.400
Stop wanting to turn on the cloud saves, eh?

19:47.400 --> 19:50.880
Borderlands 3 PC players report losing their save data.

19:50.880 --> 19:53.800
Many users seem to believe the issue lies in the cloud.

19:53.800 --> 19:57.240
Multiple players on Twitter have reported problems after activating cloud saves that

19:57.240 --> 20:01.560
then either wiped progress completely or reset to an earlier save point.

20:01.560 --> 20:04.080
One fan tweeted Gearbox and Epic Games asking,

20:10.040 --> 20:13.240
Is there a way to revert it back so I don't lose all the time and all the gear I've got?

20:13.240 --> 20:15.000
Yeah, Borderlands 3 deleted my save.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.480
Looks like I'll be starting over.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.640
I'm guessing this is cloud save related.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.640
PSA.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.200
Do not turn on cloud saves.

20:21.200 --> 20:25.280
Maybe that initial question of where are the cloud saves wasn't so much about, hey, does

20:25.280 --> 20:29.600
this game have cloud saves, and more like, where the hell did my save file go?

20:29.600 --> 20:31.720
And here's another question that's probably worth asking.

20:31.720 --> 20:33.480
Where the hell did my bandwidth go?

20:33.480 --> 20:36.480
Flare 2V, a professional streamer, said,

20:39.480 --> 20:45.640
My internet can't stream and also handle whatever of my personal data Borderlands 3 is uploading

20:45.640 --> 20:46.640
in the background.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.960
And take a look at his usage stats.

20:48.960 --> 20:53.240
Holy shit, that has a lot of data being sent out by Borderlands 3.exe.

20:53.240 --> 20:56.600
I mean, maybe it's all netplay stuff, right?

20:56.600 --> 21:01.000
Well, let's talk to the people that cracked a Nuvo about what this could possibly be.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.940
This guy understandably didn't want to have his name put out there, since he helped bypass

21:04.940 --> 21:08.080
one of the most commonly used anti-piracy services.

21:08.120 --> 21:10.200
But he has a lot to say about Borderlands 3.

21:10.200 --> 21:14.180
The current Nuvo has been recoded from the ground up, and our leaked source code that

21:14.180 --> 21:16.600
was used to circumvent Nuvo no longer works.

21:16.600 --> 21:20.860
This latest version with Borderlands 3 is basically a virtual machine, but each time

21:20.860 --> 21:25.440
you compile the game, it creates a new assembly language for the game, and a new JIT for it

21:25.440 --> 21:26.440
too.

21:26.440 --> 21:27.600
Makes it hard to crack.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.560
People have to spend a bunch of time trying to map out what Nuvo instruction is, which

21:30.560 --> 21:32.000
x86 instruction.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.960
Couple that with the fact that the Borderlands 3 game binaries are usually encrypted, and

21:35.960 --> 21:41.280
Nuvo itself unencrypts them on the fly, and now forcing a 10 second 2 mbit limit, where

21:41.280 --> 21:45.600
any variation in this shuts off your game as tampering, it's hard.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.660
It's VM protect, but good.

21:47.660 --> 21:51.320
By the way, VM protect is basically a program that will run other programs on an emulated

21:51.320 --> 21:54.040
computer with non-standard architecture.

21:54.040 --> 21:57.200
Basically meaning that when you run a program, you don't actually run the program.

21:57.200 --> 22:01.920
Your computer generates another computer inside of it, which the user, you, have limited access

22:01.920 --> 22:04.960
to, and then runs the program on that faked computer.

22:04.960 --> 22:09.800
This shit is so intrusive that it would lock up the mouse at random intervals outside of

22:09.800 --> 22:13.260
the game due to it checking for unauthorized inputs when I tried injecting.

22:13.260 --> 22:16.880
It has to be some kind of keylogging spyware in order to do this.

22:16.880 --> 22:20.600
That will be super juicy if we can prove that kind of illegal content on keeping pirates

22:20.600 --> 22:24.020
out at the expense of possible user data being mined.

22:24.020 --> 22:27.680
Our current study of Borderlands 3 shows the only binary that is encrypted is the main

22:27.680 --> 22:28.680
EXE.

22:28.680 --> 22:32.200
This new version is indeed a stupidly bloated virtual machine.

22:32.200 --> 22:37.040
The main EXE is estimated to be ten times larger than the DRM-free version.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.920
The new challenge is how it phones home and gets its encryption keys.

22:39.920 --> 22:43.160
It purely depends on your CPU, some sort of hash based off of it.

22:43.160 --> 22:46.720
That's why earlier cracks had Intel and AMD specific versions.

22:46.720 --> 22:50.640
This one seems to sign a unique key based on your hardware, possibly requiring a different

22:50.640 --> 22:52.120
crack for each PC.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.120
Shit's fucked until we bypass this and somehow make it universal.

22:55.120 --> 22:56.120
Unlikely.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.480
Here's the TLDR.

22:57.480 --> 23:01.280
Borderlands 3 executable file is ten times larger than it needs to be, and all of that

23:01.280 --> 23:05.500
extra stuff isn't the game, it's an application that emulates a virtual computer which then

23:05.500 --> 23:06.500
runs the game.

23:06.500 --> 23:09.240
This allows the game to strictly control what your PC does.

23:09.240 --> 23:14.200
It records all of your PC's actions and inputs, and then sends that data back to Gearbox,

23:14.200 --> 23:17.340
requiring 2MB per second of your internet bandwidth to do so.

23:17.340 --> 23:21.200
And by the way, this is actually illegal, because secretly installing keyloggers onto

23:21.200 --> 23:23.080
a PC is a criminal offence.

23:23.080 --> 23:27.080
All of this is done to prevent piracy and send all of your computer's behaviors, actions

23:27.080 --> 23:30.560
and data back to Gearbox, 2K or Epic.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.720
This all sounds awful.

23:32.720 --> 23:36.500
If there were only some kind of workaround, yeah I know you can pirate it, but what if

23:36.500 --> 23:38.960
there were something completely legal that we could do?

23:38.960 --> 23:42.860
I refunded Borderlands 3 and uninstalled it from the Epic Games Store, but found its install

23:42.860 --> 23:47.320
directory and its executable is still there, and I can unfortunately continue to play Borderlands

23:47.320 --> 23:48.920
3 even though it's gone.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.480
Talk about sick DRM.

23:50.480 --> 23:58.280
Okay, so the solution is, legally buy it, legally refund it, then keep playing it.

23:58.280 --> 24:02.080
I mean, it's no different from the tired customer service clerk at Walmart taking a

24:02.080 --> 24:05.840
refund but not actually checking to see that you didn't give the product back, because

24:05.840 --> 24:07.440
they just don't give a shit anymore.

24:07.440 --> 24:09.560
The problem is Walmarts, not yours.

24:09.560 --> 24:13.480
If the Epic Games Store wants to behave like a sad minimum wage worker in their 60s who

24:13.480 --> 24:16.160
has lost all hope for their life, I'm okay with that.

24:16.160 --> 24:20.520
But you know, there has to be some benefit to playing Borderlands 3 legit, like having

24:20.520 --> 24:21.520
access to all those microtransactions.

24:21.520 --> 24:25.720
Wait a minute, I thought Randy Pitchford said there was no microtransactions in Borderlands

24:25.720 --> 24:26.720
3.

24:26.720 --> 24:30.760
We're working on the big campaign DLC and will probably also offer additional cosmetics,

24:30.760 --> 24:32.600
just as we did with Borderlands 2.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.720
What we will not do is free-to-play style microtransactions.

24:35.720 --> 24:37.960
No premium currency, no loot boxes, etc.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.920
Okay, okay, I get it Randy.

24:39.920 --> 24:42.600
We'll have DLC campaigns for sale, but no microtransactions.

24:42.600 --> 24:46.280
2K Games has sent a statement confirming that cosmetic items will be for sale in Borderlands

24:46.280 --> 24:48.640
3.

24:48.640 --> 24:52.640
Players will have the option to purchase certain cosmetic items like character, vehicle, and

24:52.640 --> 24:53.840
weapon skins.

24:53.840 --> 24:57.400
But none of these purchases will be considered pay-to-win or impacting the gameplay, like

24:57.400 --> 24:59.000
weapons or actual gear.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.800
Okay, so it's Randy's understanding of what a microtransaction is, not what all of our

25:03.800 --> 25:05.800
understanding of what a microtransaction is.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.980
I mean, Randy even says this in a twitter reply to the article.

25:08.980 --> 25:11.720
Come on guys, shitty clickbait headline.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.280
Literally seconds before I said that, I made it very clear we're going to be doing more

25:14.280 --> 25:16.880
cosmetic stuff like we did in Borderlands 2.

25:16.880 --> 25:20.400
You know I was talking about premium currency and loot boxes kind of stuff not being in

25:20.400 --> 25:21.400
the game.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.200
You know, there's a fair argument to be made here.

25:23.560 --> 25:24.560
Loot boxes are pretty shitty.

25:24.560 --> 25:28.000
I don't care if they contain only cosmetic stuff like in Overwatch, but if rolling the

25:28.000 --> 25:32.040
dice is the only way to progress in the game, like with the whole Battlefront 2 controversy,

25:32.040 --> 25:33.600
it makes the game unplayable.

25:33.600 --> 25:37.680
At the same time, microtransactions don't just refer to loot boxes or other free-to-play

25:37.680 --> 25:38.680
models, Randy.

25:38.680 --> 25:42.560
A microtransaction is a tiny purchase within a game to get some in-game item.

25:42.560 --> 25:47.680
Cosmetic or impactful, direct purchase or loot box, they're all microtransactions.

25:47.680 --> 25:52.320
Buying skins or outfits or decals for vehicles, they're all microtransactions too.

25:52.440 --> 25:56.240
And people are angry, Randy, because we yearn for a return to where cosmetics were earned

25:56.240 --> 25:58.720
by completing side quests or achievements.

25:58.720 --> 26:02.880
You know, like in Borderlands 2, where almost all the cosmetics dropped off bosses or were

26:02.880 --> 26:03.880
the product of quests?

26:03.880 --> 26:07.340
That's what people want games to be again, Randy, and you're part of the problem.

26:07.340 --> 26:10.800
So Borderlands 3's launch is a dumpster fire, but the games media hasn't been talking

26:10.800 --> 26:11.800
about it too much.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.760
Instead, they've been publishing helpful guides on how to write comedy while still

26:14.760 --> 26:16.260
being a proper male feminist.

26:16.260 --> 26:20.120
Like PC Game N's Borderlands 3's sense of humor.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.120
Be edgy.

26:21.120 --> 26:22.120
Be funny.

26:22.120 --> 26:23.120
Don't be cruel.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.120
Don't be insensitive.

26:24.120 --> 26:26.120
Maybe I sound like an old codger who just doesn't get it, but I don't think you

26:26.120 --> 26:28.800
can be edgy without being cruel at least a little bit.

26:28.800 --> 26:32.200
Every joke has to have a subject, and being the butt of the joke will always be at least

26:32.200 --> 26:33.520
a little uncomfortable.

26:33.520 --> 26:37.040
Part of being an adult is learning to laugh at yourself rather than lash out in a screeching

26:37.040 --> 26:38.720
fit whenever you're made fun of.

26:38.720 --> 26:43.720
If your comedy is any good, you will be at least slightly cruel to somebody.

26:43.720 --> 26:45.960
A joke about somebody will be cruel to that somebody.

26:45.960 --> 26:48.320
A rape joke will be cruel to the person telling the joke.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.380
A pun will be cruel to the audience.

26:50.380 --> 26:54.680
Comedy requires that somebody, somewhere and sometime end up with egg on their face.

26:54.680 --> 26:58.940
If SJWs refuse to do this, then it's no wonder that almost all social justice comedy

26:58.940 --> 27:00.560
is completely unwatchable.

27:00.560 --> 27:02.800
But there's more to Gearbox than Borderlands 3.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.680
Like, hey, Battleborn.

27:04.680 --> 27:08.040
Battleborn was a game that basically went head to head with Overwatch and got absolutely

27:08.040 --> 27:09.960
fucking annihilated.

27:09.960 --> 27:11.440
Nobody played Battleborn.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.880
Overwatch had millions of players at its height.

27:13.880 --> 27:18.440
According to Steamcharts, Battleborn's all-time peak was 12,000 players.

27:18.440 --> 27:23.080
It never broke that 1000 a month average again after its initial launch month, and never

27:23.080 --> 27:26.440
made it above 100 again after August of 2017.

27:26.440 --> 27:30.220
Gearbox is still paying to keep Battleborn servers running, but the average number of

27:30.220 --> 27:35.040
players online at any one time in August of 2019 was just 13.2.

27:35.040 --> 27:40.080
The game was meant to support a healthy update cycle like Overwatch, but 14 months after

27:40.080 --> 27:42.480
launch, all updates stopped.

27:42.480 --> 28:09.880
It was a critical and financial failure for Gearbox.

28:09.880 --> 28:12.080
Talk about fucking desperate, dude.

28:12.080 --> 28:15.440
Also gamers filled that subreddit up with Overwatch porn just to spite Randy.

28:15.440 --> 28:18.840
And I do mean spite him, because at the time of Randy's tweet, the subreddit was pretty

28:18.840 --> 28:22.320
new and the vast majority of content on it was from one user.

28:22.320 --> 28:26.960
Did Randy Pitchford create his own Battleborn porn in a desperate attempt to save his game?

28:26.960 --> 28:29.840
I mean, there's no proof of it, but I like to think so.

28:29.840 --> 28:32.600
Randy became particularly salty about this once it was discovered.

28:32.600 --> 28:35.960
I was about to block you, but then I read your Twitter bio and realized you probably

28:35.960 --> 28:37.400
need more love in your life.

28:37.400 --> 28:38.400
Thanks.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.200
Wow, what the fuck, attacking somebody personally?

28:40.200 --> 28:41.200
That's low, man.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.920
You should embrace your failures and laugh at them.

28:42.920 --> 28:43.920
You made a crappy game.

28:43.920 --> 28:44.920
That's okay.

28:44.920 --> 28:45.920
I was being sincere.

28:45.920 --> 28:48.320
Also, fuck you for calling our game crappy.

28:48.320 --> 28:49.320
We love our game.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.320
We love our fans.

28:50.320 --> 28:51.320
Randy.

28:51.320 --> 28:52.320
What fans?

28:52.320 --> 28:56.000
But okay, this is all just fun drama so far.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.200
Let's get into the Gearbox fraud.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.200
Want to do that?

28:59.200 --> 29:02.720
Want to talk about the fraud, the millions of dollars stolen, the extreme incompetence?

29:02.720 --> 29:05.560
Sega approached Gearbox to make Aliens Colonial Marines.

29:05.560 --> 29:08.600
If you haven't played Aliens, it's a steaming pile of shit.

29:08.600 --> 29:11.840
It looks like it was barely worked on, and that's because it was.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.920
Aliens Colonial Marines.

29:13.920 --> 29:19.480
Gearbox stole funds from Sega to make Borderlands 2 and Duke Nukem Forever.

29:19.480 --> 29:24.480
An unnamed Sega staffer has revealed that Gearbox Software stole funds from Sega to

29:24.480 --> 29:27.420
make Borderlands 2 and Duke Nukem Forever.

29:27.420 --> 29:31.980
These funds were actually for Aliens Colonial Marines, but Gearbox betrayed Sega according

29:31.980 --> 29:33.240
to the source.

29:33.240 --> 29:37.440
Pitchford and Gearbox wanted to focus heavily on Duke Nukem Forever, but how would they

29:37.440 --> 29:41.040
get the money to hire some of the 3D Realms team and even buy the intellectual property?

29:41.040 --> 29:44.960
Sure, they made a lot from Borderlands, but guess where they got the money to fund Borderlands

29:44.960 --> 29:46.200
in the first place?

29:46.200 --> 29:47.200
Yep.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.200
Sega.

29:48.200 --> 29:52.800
So Gearbox essentially lied to Sega, mishandled funds, broke agreements and contractual obligations

29:52.800 --> 29:56.920
to work on other projects, didn't want to work on a game they were contractually obligated

29:56.920 --> 29:58.920
to work on, and gave it to another team.

29:58.920 --> 30:02.180
Poor organization and direction on Aliens Colonial Marines.

30:02.180 --> 30:05.720
Took on too many projects from different companies at once, and other things we may not even

30:05.720 --> 30:06.720
know about.

30:06.720 --> 30:10.480
Hell, part of me believes that Gearbox wanted this thing delayed as much as possible so

30:10.480 --> 30:12.680
they could get more funding to embezzle from Sega.

30:12.680 --> 30:16.640
Sega was looking to sue Gearbox, but since Gearbox shipped the product, they couldn't.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.000
So what kind of game did we finally get?

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Oh.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Oh no.

30:21.000 --> 30:25.600
He's just a cute little alien guy, isn't he?

30:25.600 --> 30:30.200
Aliens Colonial Marines was outsourced by Gearbox to another company, Timegate, and

30:30.200 --> 30:34.420
some former Timegate employees decided to come forward as well and describe the situation

30:34.420 --> 30:35.420
to Eurogamer.

30:35.420 --> 30:39.460
Aliens Colonial Marines is heavily regarded as one of the biggest trainwrecks in gaming

30:39.460 --> 30:40.460
history.

30:40.460 --> 30:43.780
Criticisms have run rampant from its shoddy critical reception to gamers crying afoul

30:43.780 --> 30:47.620
of its pre-release demo not being at all representative of the final product.

30:47.620 --> 30:51.740
It became apparent that Gearbox had ignored the game for years.

30:51.740 --> 30:56.300
According to three staffers, Gearbox had focused the vast majority of its efforts on Duke Nukem

30:56.300 --> 30:58.640
Forever, Borderlands, and Borderlands 2.

30:58.640 --> 31:03.120
There was obviously not four years of work done on the game, said one source.

31:03.120 --> 31:06.640
Apparently what Gearbox gave Timegate was merely a collection of assets with little

31:06.640 --> 31:09.600
rhyme or reason as to how it was all planned to come together.

31:09.600 --> 31:13.000
A lot of assets just didn't seem like they fit there, the source noted.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.320
Perhaps the biggest thing Timegate didn't have when it began developing the game was

31:16.320 --> 31:17.500
a script.

31:17.500 --> 31:21.720
According to three sources, narrative designers at Gearbox and Timegate were constantly writing

31:21.720 --> 31:25.800
and rewriting the game, causing the designers to discard entire levels.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.920
For a couple months, we were just kind of guessing, said one source.

31:28.920 --> 31:31.780
It's really weird to work on a game when you don't have a basic idea of how things will

31:31.780 --> 31:32.780
work.

31:32.780 --> 31:36.620
They said many times through demo production, don't worry about performance, just make

31:36.620 --> 31:38.900
it awesome, said one source.

31:38.900 --> 31:41.420
There's a reason those demos were never really playable.

31:41.420 --> 31:45.700
The game feels like it was made in nine months, said a source that worked on the project.

31:45.700 --> 31:46.980
That's because it was.

31:46.980 --> 31:51.460
And if you needed any more proof that Aliens Colonial Marines was a rushed backburner mess

31:51.460 --> 31:57.500
of a project despite it being Gearbox's only financial lifeline from 2008 to 2013, a simple

31:57.500 --> 32:01.680
typo in the code is responsible for the goofy behaviors of the aliens in the game.

32:01.680 --> 32:08.120
As a user of moddb.com discovered, the biggest bug in the game is just one letter long.

32:08.120 --> 32:12.040
Inside your game's configuration file is the following line of code.

32:12.040 --> 32:19.160
Class remapping equals pkengame.pkensequenceact underscore attach xeno to tether, points at

32:19.160 --> 32:23.720
pkengame.pkensequenceact underscore attach pawn to tether, except it doesn't actually

32:23.720 --> 32:25.120
say attach pawn to tether.

32:25.120 --> 32:27.560
It says attach pawn to T-ether.

32:27.560 --> 32:31.280
The attach pawn to tether function controls the behavior of the enemies in the game, and

32:31.280 --> 32:36.400
you fix this one typo, the game's enemies actually act like enemies and not puppets.

32:36.400 --> 32:40.240
They had coded behavior for the aliens to stalk around the player, coordinate in groups,

32:40.240 --> 32:43.880
patrol areas, attack from a flank, all kinds of cool stuff.

32:43.880 --> 32:46.760
And none of it worked because they released the game without giving the code a second

32:46.760 --> 32:47.760
pass.

32:47.760 --> 32:51.440
As for Duke Nukem Forever, nobody expected that game to actually be good.

32:51.440 --> 32:55.720
It was in development hell since 1999, and Gearbox picked up the project just to get

32:55.720 --> 32:57.040
something out the door.

32:57.040 --> 33:01.880
Yeah, yeah, they siphoned money meant to be used for Alien from Sega, but fine, whatever.

33:01.880 --> 33:04.440
Duke Nukem Forever really wasn't Gearbox's fault.

33:04.440 --> 33:07.360
They did the best they could with what they were given, and now they own the Duke Nukem

33:07.360 --> 33:08.360
IP.

33:08.360 --> 33:10.440
It seems like they don't really plan to use it, though.

33:10.440 --> 33:14.000
New Duke Nukem game is highly unlikely, says Gearbox.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.600
Like a washed up actor, Duke Nukem's future only has cameo appearances instead of starring

33:18.600 --> 33:19.600
roles.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.720
If you ever wanted to pick a character that modern day Verifieds on Twitter would call

33:22.720 --> 33:26.640
the most toxic of them all, Duke Nukem would be that guy.

33:26.640 --> 33:30.120
He is the epitome of toxic masculinity, and that's the point.

33:30.120 --> 33:34.080
He's an over-the-top caricature, and I've always been fun with laughing at the absurdity

33:34.080 --> 33:35.560
of the Duke Nukem games.

33:35.560 --> 33:38.940
And despite the previous article, Randy himself said on Twitter,

33:38.940 --> 33:43.080
I owe a good part of my early career to the franchise and I love it.

33:43.080 --> 33:47.400
But Duke needs a future, we'll take care of the past, but we need to do so in a way

33:47.400 --> 33:49.480
that does not ruin the future.

33:49.480 --> 33:51.120
What is that future?

33:51.120 --> 33:55.680
I mean, there was a shitty cameo of a neutered Duke in Bulletstorm, but that's about it.

33:55.720 --> 33:58.640
I could have sworn there was an interview with Randy Pitchford recently where he said

33:58.640 --> 34:03.920
that he was glad that he owned the Duke Nukem franchise, because it's pure toxic masculinity,

34:03.920 --> 34:07.800
it's harmful to gaming, and as long as he has his way, Duke will never come back.

34:07.800 --> 34:10.720
But maybe I just imagined it, because I can't find it anymore.

34:10.720 --> 34:13.100
Vice published something similar anyway.

34:13.100 --> 34:16.980
How Duke Nukem can be saved for the 21st century, let's see.

34:16.980 --> 34:20.040
But there's something different about this invasion, and it's nothing to do with the

34:20.040 --> 34:21.800
aliens themselves.

34:21.800 --> 34:25.660
This time, the women that Duke used to objectify are fighting back to, and this is where he

34:25.660 --> 34:28.500
road to salvation begins.

34:28.500 --> 34:32.380
Duke's still a condescending piece of shit, content to fight beside women in a purely

34:32.380 --> 34:35.660
isn't-this-cute kind of way, but his allies are shown as equals.

34:35.660 --> 34:38.420
When he tries it on, he gets shot down.

34:38.420 --> 34:42.140
This is an essay on how a future Duke Nukem game should be all about how Duke realizes

34:42.140 --> 34:43.140
that he's problematic.

34:43.140 --> 34:47.360
Honestly, the worst part is, if Gearbox ever does make a new Duke game, it'll probably

34:47.360 --> 34:48.360
be this.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.980
So far, the picture painted is pretty clear.

34:50.980 --> 34:55.380
Randy Pitchford has his pet project, Borderlands, and he's taken on other side projects in

34:55.380 --> 34:58.380
order to fund his company while he works on the main thing.

34:58.380 --> 35:00.120
That's fair, a lot of people do that.

35:00.120 --> 35:04.020
But generally, it's expected that you actually produce your side projects and then use the

35:04.020 --> 35:08.820
profit to create your main one, not just take the funding and run, leaving wreckage in your

35:08.820 --> 35:09.820
wake.

35:09.820 --> 35:15.460
Which makes it all the more surprising that, I think, the initial concept for Borderlands

35:15.460 --> 35:17.640
was actually plagiarized.

35:17.640 --> 35:23.280
The original version of Borderlands 1 looked a lot like a knockoff of Rage, which itself

35:23.280 --> 35:27.400
was an extremely mediocre Playstation 3 shooter.

35:27.400 --> 35:32.800
This video looks nothing like the Borderlands that eventually came out, but it is, in fact,

35:32.800 --> 35:35.200
how the game originally looked.

35:35.200 --> 35:37.240
And boy, does it look generic.

35:37.240 --> 35:41.880
Gearbox knew their game was in trouble, and needed something to make itself stick out.

35:41.880 --> 35:47.880
Here's some clips from a short film titled Code Hunters, made by Ben Hibben for MTV back

35:47.880 --> 35:48.880
in 2006.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.120
Does it remind you of anything?

35:51.120 --> 35:52.580
Anything at all?

35:52.580 --> 35:58.100
Is it somewhat similar to the opening sequence to the original Borderlands, perhaps?

35:58.100 --> 36:02.220
Maybe some scenes in Borderlands were directly ripped off from Code Hunters, I don't know?

36:02.220 --> 36:07.620
In an interview from 2012, Ben Hibben stated that he was contacted by Gearbox prior to

36:07.620 --> 36:10.780
the redesign of the game back in 2008.

36:10.780 --> 36:15.500
They asked me if I would be interested to direct or design some cutscenes for them.

36:15.500 --> 36:18.900
We exchanged a few emails, but the project didn't materialize in the end.

36:18.900 --> 36:23.260
I didn't think much of it at the time, until I saw the final game in 2009.

36:23.260 --> 36:27.660
I have never created or designed anything for Gearbox or Borderlands.

36:27.660 --> 36:32.580
Gearbox saw my work and decided to reproduce it, make it their own, without my help or

36:32.580 --> 36:33.580
my consent.

36:33.580 --> 36:37.260
The hardest part for me when this happened, was understanding why they wouldn't ask

36:37.260 --> 36:38.260
me directly.

36:38.260 --> 36:41.520
We were already talking about doing some work together, it made no sense.

36:41.520 --> 36:43.740
I understand being inspired.

36:43.740 --> 36:45.260
I understand giving homage.

36:45.260 --> 36:49.940
But when that's the case, you're not generally calling up the guy to offer him a job, cutting

36:49.940 --> 36:55.540
him off without warning, and then forging on ahead with your, for the time, unique style,

36:55.540 --> 36:59.100
while remaining publicly silent and ignoring all questions about it.

36:59.100 --> 37:02.600
In my opinion, if you're acting this way, you're probably not inspired.

37:02.600 --> 37:06.060
You're probably embarrassed that you blatantly ripped somebody off who's more talented

37:06.060 --> 37:07.060
than you are.

37:07.060 --> 37:08.880
Okay, uh, is this everything?

37:08.880 --> 37:11.100
Is that all you've got up that magician's sleeve of yours, Randy?

37:11.100 --> 37:15.780
We've got the plagiarism, the misuse of funds, the incompetence, the illegal data-harvesting,

37:15.780 --> 37:19.220
the brow-beating of your critics, the constant scum-bucket moves.

37:19.220 --> 37:21.140
I think that's all the sins of Gearbox, right?

37:21.140 --> 37:23.540
I mean, there couldn't be anything else, could there?

37:23.540 --> 37:25.340
How much worse could it get?

37:25.340 --> 37:31.980
Plaintiff Wade Callender, in his individual capacity and on behalf of The Hatch LLC, files

37:31.980 --> 37:37.340
this original petition against Randell Pitchford II and Gearbox Software.

37:37.340 --> 37:42.020
Randy Pitchford is a manipulative and morally bankrupt CEO who shamefully exploited his

37:42.020 --> 37:45.960
oldest friend, a Texas attorney and military veteran named Wade Callender.

37:45.960 --> 37:51.300
It was Randy himself who breached his duties by exploiting Gearbox employees and property

37:51.300 --> 37:53.600
to fund Pitchford's private cravings.

37:53.600 --> 37:58.700
For example, while Randy was denying employee raises predicated on low-cash reserves, Randy

37:58.700 --> 38:04.260
secretly saddled Gearbox employees with the burden of repaying a private, personal $12

38:04.260 --> 38:09.660
million dollar bonus that Randy Pitchford re-routed from Gearbox's publisher directly

38:09.660 --> 38:13.820
to Randy's side entity, Pitchford Entertainment Media & Magic.

38:13.820 --> 38:18.660
Gearbox was contacted in 2014 by someone who discovered a USB drive at a medieval times

38:18.660 --> 38:21.140
restaurant in Dallas County, Texas.

38:21.140 --> 38:25.320
Because the USB drive contained sensitive Gearbox corporate material, the Good Samaritan

38:25.320 --> 38:29.800
rightly suspected that the USB drive belonged to a high-level Gearbox employee.

38:29.800 --> 38:34.200
Upon hearing of the discovery of this drive, Pitchford declared the drive was his and requested

38:34.200 --> 38:35.560
a prompt return.

38:35.560 --> 38:40.260
While the drive was being recovered in Texas, Pitchford and Callender were in San Francisco

38:40.260 --> 38:45.160
mediating yet another case in which Pitchford's conduct was front and center, the alien Colonial

38:45.160 --> 38:46.680
Marines case.

38:46.680 --> 38:51.440
Pending his return to Texas, Callender instructed Gearbox personnel in Texas to make a copy

38:51.440 --> 38:56.240
of the USB drive to ensure that its contents could be verified and, if necessary, acted

38:56.240 --> 38:57.240
upon.

38:57.240 --> 39:01.620
Before Callender could review the USB drive's contents, Pitchford intervened by retrieving

39:01.620 --> 39:06.940
the lost USB drive himself and ordering Gearbox personnel to destroy the copy that Callender

39:06.940 --> 39:07.940
requested.

39:07.940 --> 39:12.300
On information and belief, Randy Pitchford's USB drive contained much more than the sensitive

39:12.300 --> 39:18.220
documents of Gearbox and its business partners like Take-Two Interactive, 2K Games, Sega,

39:18.220 --> 39:20.540
Microsoft, Sony, and etc.

39:20.540 --> 39:25.100
Upon information and belief, Randy Pitchford's USB drive also contained Randy Pitchford's

39:25.100 --> 39:28.040
personal collection of underage pornography.

39:28.040 --> 39:32.840
Upon information and belief, Pitchford's USB drive experience wasn't enough to deter

39:32.840 --> 39:38.440
Randy Pitchford's mischief, as Pitchford subsequently siphoned Gearbox profits to fund

39:38.440 --> 39:43.800
parties thrown by Pitchford and his wife at their home for their own personal benefit.

39:43.800 --> 39:49.440
At these events, which Pitchford and his wife affectionately term peacock parties, adult

39:49.440 --> 39:55.360
men have reportedly exposed themselves to minors to the amusement of Randy Pitchford.

39:55.360 --> 40:01.660
In November of 2016, Pitchford informed Callender that he had reached a side deal with Take-Two

40:01.660 --> 40:03.200
and 2K Games.

40:03.200 --> 40:08.880
The deal, which Pitchford insisted upon concealing, afforded Randy Pitchford a personal, secretive

40:08.880 --> 40:12.200
executive bonus of $12 million.

40:12.200 --> 40:16.620
Because Pitchford agreed to have his private bonuses counted as advances upon the royalties

40:16.620 --> 40:21.320
owed to Gearbox employees, those employees and their families won't receive any of

40:21.320 --> 40:26.760
their profit shares until their work repays Randy's bonus to Take-Two.

40:26.760 --> 40:28.640
Holy shit.

40:28.640 --> 40:33.480
And here's a cryptic tweet from a former Gearbox vice president and voice of the Borderlands

40:33.480 --> 40:39.400
character Claptrap, no longer under Randy's thumb, posted shortly after the lawsuit was

40:39.400 --> 40:40.400
filed.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.580
Yes, it's true.

40:42.580 --> 40:47.820
On the December 22nd episode of the podcast The Piff Pod, Randy Pitchford appears to partially

40:47.820 --> 40:50.580
validate Wade Callender's story.

40:50.580 --> 40:54.240
He spends a good chunk of the time talking about how he likes to watch pornography labeled

40:54.240 --> 40:59.040
barely legal, and how he was particularly mesmerized by a cam girl who once squirted

40:59.040 --> 41:02.580
live for him, stating that she's a fucking magician.

41:02.580 --> 41:06.300
Apparently Pitchford's interest in her was because, I guess, getting a woman off is a

41:06.300 --> 41:08.460
magic trick in his eyes?

41:08.460 --> 41:09.460
Yeesh.

41:09.460 --> 41:12.220
I know Randy's a magician, but apparently not so much in bed.

41:12.220 --> 41:17.220
The podcast's description states, be warned, this podcast is not for the faint-hearted,

41:17.220 --> 41:20.940
as Randy gushes about his love of magic, or something like that.

41:20.940 --> 41:22.500
Yeah, they knew what was up.

41:22.500 --> 41:25.060
So some people are saying child porn.

41:25.060 --> 41:29.700
Randy's saying barely legal porn, but no one's talking about those peacock parties.

41:29.700 --> 41:32.980
Claptrap's voice actor said it was true, but he's also got some other things to say.

41:32.980 --> 41:37.700
I was fine with moving on after Gearbox, but when my former boss starts mouthing off about

41:37.700 --> 41:42.820
various aspects of my employment, including how highly compensated I was and how generous

41:42.820 --> 41:46.180
he is, I feel obligated to correct the record.

41:46.180 --> 41:50.540
I had a lot of mixed feelings when asked to reprise the role of Claptrap, but I put

41:50.540 --> 41:54.060
our differences aside and did something cool for Borderlands fans.

41:54.060 --> 41:59.500
I offered to do it for free, in exchange for past royalties owed, plus an apology for something

41:59.500 --> 42:01.900
I've never spoken about before.

42:01.900 --> 42:07.100
Randy physically assaulted me in the lobby of the Marriott Marquis at GDC 2017.

42:07.100 --> 42:10.780
I think Randy's been on tilt for the last few years.

42:10.780 --> 42:13.140
He's not the victim he portrays himself to be.

42:13.140 --> 42:15.460
I blocked him a couple years ago for stalking.

42:15.460 --> 42:20.340
As an aside, it seems a bit conspicuous that he chimed in on my salary, but didn't mention

42:20.340 --> 42:24.060
anything about the $12 million he siphoned from the employee royalty pool.

42:24.060 --> 42:26.340
Eddings later elaborated on the event.

42:26.340 --> 42:29.980
He shoved the fuck out of me while I'm on the balls of my feet trying to whisper.

42:29.980 --> 42:31.900
He knocked me back four steps.

42:31.900 --> 42:33.980
I believe I caught him in a deception.

42:33.980 --> 42:38.700
What's more is that Eddings says his claim can be backed up by one of two cooperative

42:38.700 --> 42:41.900
witnesses, Gearbox co-founder Landon Montgomery.

42:41.900 --> 42:44.300
Montgomery corroborates the assault allegations, saying,

42:44.300 --> 42:49.260
David leaned up to whisper something to Randy and out of the blue Randy shoves him, hard.

42:49.260 --> 42:53.820
Eddings also offered screenshots from a tirade of Snapchat messages he received from Pitchford

42:53.820 --> 42:58.700
after the incident, with the CEO having demanded, who the fuck are you loyal to?

42:58.700 --> 43:01.500
And jeering that Eddings' priorities are completely fucked.

43:01.500 --> 43:07.740
Yeah, you know that bit in the final Borderlands 2 DLC where Claptrap, with a new voice actor,

43:07.740 --> 43:29.620
begs Lilith for his job back?

43:29.620 --> 43:31.620
Puts that in a whole new light, doesn't it?

43:31.620 --> 43:34.620
But hey, you know what, it's all just okay.

43:34.620 --> 43:35.900
It's all fine.

43:35.900 --> 43:40.700
After all, Randy Pitchford's a little autistic, he's a little on the spectrum, so we have

43:40.700 --> 43:43.700
to forgive him or that's ableist, right?

43:43.700 --> 43:44.700
Right guys?

43:44.700 --> 43:49.140
You can do whatever you want nowadays, peacock parties, physical assaults, potentially child

43:49.140 --> 43:54.020
porn, losing private documents at a restaurant, embezzling funds, stealing money from your

43:54.020 --> 43:58.780
employees, stealing money from your partners, intentionally delaying and tanking a game

43:58.780 --> 44:02.700
in order to make way for your pet project, ripping off the only unique thing your pet

44:02.700 --> 44:07.740
project has from somebody vastly more talented than you, loading up paying customers computers

44:07.740 --> 44:12.720
with malware designed to monitor your usage and keylog everything you do and sell it all

44:12.720 --> 44:16.740
off to the Epic Store to their Chinese state corporate overlords and physically intimidate

44:16.740 --> 44:19.420
anyone who finds out about any of your rotten little schemes.

44:19.420 --> 44:22.060
It's all fine if you're a little autistic.

44:22.060 --> 44:24.940
Randy just doesn't know any better, you bigot.

44:24.940 --> 44:27.540
Let's go all the way back to that initial post.

44:27.540 --> 44:31.780
The one that was probably fake because the promised leak of Borderlands 3 never actually

44:31.780 --> 44:32.780
came out.

44:32.780 --> 44:36.300
Despite that, a lot of the stuff in it ultimately lined up, didn't it?

44:36.300 --> 44:40.500
Randy Pitchford is confirmed by multiple people to be a control freak and a bully.

44:40.500 --> 44:44.540
Multiple sources and stories show him to be exploiting his employees and shuffling money

44:44.540 --> 44:46.500
around in an attempt to line his own pockets.

44:46.500 --> 44:49.460
There's a chance he might even be a sexual abuser, too.

44:49.460 --> 44:54.660
And Borderlands 3, now that it's out, pales in comparison to Borderlands 2 in nearly every

44:54.660 --> 44:55.660
way.

44:55.660 --> 44:58.740
I will never buy a game from these people again.

44:58.740 --> 45:02.660
I will never recommend that people buy a game from these people again.

45:02.660 --> 45:07.900
If I ever want to play Borderlands 3, or any other game made by this company, I will pirate

45:07.900 --> 45:09.020
it.

45:09.020 --> 45:11.940
If I ever want to stream it, I'll still pirate it.

45:11.940 --> 45:16.340
I am done with just putting up with all of these shitty people ruining the great passion,

45:16.340 --> 45:20.180
the one hobby, the community we've all shared for most of our lives now.

45:20.180 --> 45:21.180
Fuck em.

45:21.180 --> 45:23.500
I've got more videos kind of like this one in the works.

45:23.500 --> 45:24.500
EA, maybe?

45:24.500 --> 45:25.500
Blizzard?

45:25.500 --> 45:26.500
Bethesda?

45:26.500 --> 45:27.500
I don't know.

45:27.500 --> 45:28.500
We'll see.

45:28.500 --> 45:33.060
For the premiere of this video, I'll be over on my Twitch channel right now playing

45:33.060 --> 45:37.400
a game made by a company that I think is probably one of the last ones out there that doesn't

45:37.400 --> 45:39.800
shit the bed this badly.

45:39.800 --> 45:42.700
It's the Link's Awakening remake on the Nintendo Switch.

45:42.700 --> 45:47.980
Naomi and I are having a great time with it, so drop by twitch.tv slash Game Boomers and

45:47.980 --> 45:48.980
say hi.

45:48.980 --> 45:52.180
And if you're not watching this video on release day, that's okay.

45:52.180 --> 45:55.780
Because I stream most nights on that Twitch anyway, so come give it a look.

45:55.780 --> 45:56.780
I'll see you there.

45:56.780 --> 45:57.380
I love you.
