00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,840
In yesterday's video I talked about how inclusive language functions as aristocratic language.

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,000
Its deliberate opaqueness serves as a barrier between those with the correct politics and

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,960
the normies who are browbeat with over-educated redefinitions not based in reality any time

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,000
they step out of line.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,160
I mentioned specifically that this mentality trickles down from academia into other institutions,

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,320
often with hilarious or ridiculous results.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's take a look at some examples.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,920
You know, part of me misses the days when all we had to worry about was forced gender

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,960
neutrality upon things that didn't need it, like manhole turning into maintenance hole.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,580
I remember hearing as a kid, fireman and policeman becoming firefighter and police officer, and

11
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,000
thinking, okay that makes sense, if there are women qualified to be in those jobs, why

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
not?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But then it went off the rails.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,800
Sorority and fraternity should be called the collegiate Greek system residents, eh?

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,360
In an effort to be trans-friendly, a hospital is advising nurses to no longer use words

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,760
such as breast feeding and breast milk.

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,120
Human milk and chest milk are the more acceptable terms for midwives to use.

18
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,020
Gosh, starting off strong, eh?

19
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,280
This video's ain't getting monetized, hit up my subscribestar and Patreon, everybody.

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,200
Also, um, human milk has a completely different alternate meaning, one that I would hope doesn't

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,120
involve babies drinking it.

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,460
Do vulva owners like sex?

23
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,600
It's the wrong question.

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,880
Here's what you should ask instead.

25
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,580
Oh, I can think of a few questions already, like, do you mean women?

26
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,940
Or why am I reading this nonsense?

27
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,940
What's the short answer?

28
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,040
It depends on the person.

29
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,720
Some do like sex and some don't.

30
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,220
Just like some penis owners like sex and some don't.

31
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,660
You know, I'm actually like picturing a female esports person with the nickname the penis

32
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,980
owner, because she's got a reputation for smack talking guys during the match and then

33
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,540
winning and bragging about it.

34
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,020
Does that mean that vulva owners and penis owners are truly wired differently?

35
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,940
I think you've got to be wired differently to even write this thing, man.

36
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,560
It's not even inaccurate so far.

37
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,720
It's all biologically on point, but it feels like they ran a word replace script and input

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,700
vulva owner and penis owner.

39
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,840
For centuries, those with vulvas have had their sex and sexuality controlled by those

40
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,040
with penises.

41
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,680
This likely started in the agricultural age when women's bodies were traded for land.

42
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

43
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,020
It didn't start because people traded women's bodies for land.

44
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,680
It started because men's prehistorical burden is to work.

45
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,840
And if men were going to work, they wanted at least some guarantee that the children

46
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,700
they were working for were theirs.

47
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,900
So institutions like marriage and monogamy helped provide this assurance.

48
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,140
Most men were not these giga chads with 50 concubines.

49
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,580
Most men were like most women.

50
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,580
They were married.

51
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,580
And that was that.

52
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:39,100
Hey, fellow ovary owners and PCOS strugglers, ovary owners is degrading and dehumanizing.

53
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,100
Come on now.

54
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:45,520
So as female girls, ladies, sisters, any other transphobic slur that denies one their fundamental

55
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,120
rights to their own gender identity, trans people have the right to not have their gender

56
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
identity erased.

57
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
All right.

58
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,920
We can't call anything anything then.

59
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,400
We can't use a term to identify a thing because that's othering.

60
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,320
We just need to pretend that nothing exists and everything is everything.

61
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,560
Stop calling it female genital mutilation.

62
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,440
Vulvas aren't inherently female.

63
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,400
If you call it FGM, you're a bigot.

64
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Bye, TERFs.

65
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,440
I wonder if this is the person who wrote the vulva owner's article from earlier.

66
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,200
Also, this take doesn't even make sense.

67
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,200
If woman is the gender role and female is the biological sex, how are vulvas not inherently

68
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
female?

69
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,000
I thought the whole trans thing wasn't about saying biological sexes aren't real.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,600
The reason that a phrase like born biologically male is so upsetting to trans people is, number

71
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:35,960
one, biology is a lot more complicated than you were taught in high school.

72
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:44,040
And number two, false concepts of what is biologically true for human beings has been

73
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,120
used as a tool of oppression for our whole history.

74
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,160
Oh, never mind then.

75
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,800
I guess some of the more radical trans activists really are about denying biological sex outright.

76
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,840
Oh wow, a new campaign has been launched in support of genderless menstrual leave.

77
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,840
People who bleed.

78
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,720
I wish I still worked a normie job.

79
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,240
I'd claim one week off every month for menstruation.

80
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Hell yeah.

81
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,520
I mean, literally everybody is a person who bleeds.

82
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
So why not?

83
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,240
Here's probably the craziest example of all this I've come across so far.

84
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Buckle up.

85
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,960
Vagina is when it's surgically constructed out of a penis.

86
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,800
Front hole is when we were born with it.

87
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Holy shit.

88
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
You hear that, cis woman?

89
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,120
You've all got front holes now.

90
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,720
Vagina is a word only for post-op trans women now.

91
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,720
Vagina.

92
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,840
We use this word to talk about the genitals of trans women who have had bottom surgery.

93
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,080
Oh no, we fucking don't, that's not how any of this works.

94
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,440
Like, I remember when this sort of a thing was a fucking joke.

95
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,620
I remember when Borat called his butthole a back pussy.

96
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,880
What the fuck is wrong with you?

97
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,800
Here's the issue with all of this stuff.

98
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,660
Yes, you're making things more inclusive, but you're also stripping the word of meaning

99
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,800
in the process.

100
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,560
For example, the word spouse might be a gender neutral alternative for husband, but spouse

101
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,940
doesn't have the extra emotional attachment that husband has.

102
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,220
Spouse is a legal term.

103
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,560
Husband is a position that a man occupies, with certain duties, expectations, privileges,

104
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
and rewards.

105
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
Same with wife.

106
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,320
Same with partner, replacing boyfriend and girlfriend.

107
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,160
And sibling, replacing brother and sister.

108
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,100
And parent, replacing father and mother.

109
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,080
Because it turns out, women and men aren't exactly the same at all times.

110
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,020
Oh god, check out this list of gender neutral terms.

111
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,400
Ren replaces mom and dad?

112
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,640
I've never heard this before.

113
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,280
I've heard parent, not ren.

114
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,400
ZZ for aunt and uncle?

115
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,560
Nibling for niece and nephew?

116
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
Really nibba?

117
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,440
Prinks for prince and princess?

118
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,780
Latinx strikes again.

119
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,320
It was a trans person who posted this to my timeline, with the caption, please just misgender

120
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
me.

121
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,640
Which is the same energy as Lilith saying, it's less insulting to call me a man than

122
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,800
a womanxin.

123
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,400
Most people, even most trans people, don't want this shit.

124
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,320
For a long time, the actual real measures to force this nonsense was relegated to the

125
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,240
stupid, put your pronouns in your bio or else crowd.

126
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,560
Those people were annoying, but easily ignorable.

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,680
But then it became culturally popular to cancel people who pushed back against this imposition.

128
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,560
And then it became an offence to use normal everyday speech.

129
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,720
And then cringey holidays about these pronouns became the norm.

130
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,300
And then people began to reap social credit for simply adding a they into their bio.

131
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,680
And then the police began promoting it actively.

132
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,960
Being misgendered can have a huge impact on somebody and their personal wellbeing.

133
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,800
It also can be used as a form of abuse for somebody.

134
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,320
And that just isn't right.

135
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,640
Today is about raising awareness, getting people to have conversations and understanding

136
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,800
why it is so important to understand the pronouns that somebody wishes to be used for them.

137
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,240
And then the police began to be called on people who didn't comply with it.

138
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,360
It's not compelled speech, just shut up.

139
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,780
Do you even hear yourself?

140
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,200
It's not violating your free speech rights.

141
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,800
Just don't speak, five head.

142
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,320
And what is all this in service of?

143
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,040
The redefinitions, the new speak, the rigid enforcement of pronouns to the point that

144
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,320
the cops are being called up.

145
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,320
What's it all for?

146
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,200
Well, any progressive can answer that one.

147
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,540
It's to minimize trauma, apparently.

148
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,820
The claim is, if you're not using a trans person's preferred pronouns, regardless of

149
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,520
how obviously outlandish they are, or if you're not using gender neutral terminology, even

150
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,340
if it sounds ridiculous to your ears to say, or if you're making any reference to biology

151
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,280
insofar as sex and gender are concerned, you are inflicting new traumas on marginalized

152
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,600
people, you're triggering their past traumas, and you're hindering their recovery.

153
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,780
Maybe you're listening to all this and thinking, ha, trauma, it's just hurt feelings.

154
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,280
Is being offended a traumatic experience now?

155
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,320
Well, I don't think so, but let's actually consider the possibility.

156
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,600
My video on the pronouns Wiki included a funny throwaway joke that we should actually take

157
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,800
a bit of a closer look at.

158
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,960
At the end of it, I said, shut up and do your dishes while presenting this picture.

159
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,320
When you ask your NB, that means non-binary, roommate with a noun for a name to clean up

160
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,160
after themselves, then they post a GoFundMe to get out of their abusive housing situation.

161
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,960
This reminds me of an old, old viral post, I can't find it now, it's been lost to the

162
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,880
depths of the internet, where a woman was living with an abusive boyfriend.

163
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,720
But what made him abusive was that he asked her to get a job.

164
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,400
She said something like, I'm an abuse survivor, I got out.

165
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Know that you're not alone.

166
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,100
And it's like, dude, are you really just out here weaponizing the language of trauma because

167
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,160
you're too lazy to pick up after yourself or contribute to the household?

168
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,680
Well, that abusive housing situation from last time is actually a viral TikTok.

169
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,820
Of course, how could it not be?

170
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,320
And the replies to it are gold.

171
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,740
A lot of them are people screeching, transphobia, because apparently it's transphobic to not

172
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,520
want to live in a fucking toilet.

173
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,100
Ask yourself why all the replies contain transphobia.

174
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,840
The answer is because where you see trans person, I see overgrown child.

175
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,220
But some replies contain their own stories like this one, got to get out of this they

176
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,220
them household.

177
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,160
One of my roommates gets away with never doing dishes, citing housing trauma that makes them

178
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,320
hypersensitive to people asking them to do dishes, honestly, kind of alpha.

179
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,680
I was mowing it over in my head for a while thinking, do these people actually experience

180
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,760
trauma when being asked to do the dishes?

181
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,720
Or is it just laziness and they know they're being lazy and they're hiding behind the language

182
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
of trauma.

183
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,760
And I've come to the conclusion that it's both.

184
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
They're certainly lazy.

185
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,240
They're your dishes, you do them.

186
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,800
There's no reason anybody else should be obligated to pick up after you, but they're probably

187
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,560
also a little traumatized.

188
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,400
And to be traumatized from such a minute amount of pushback as please do your own dishes means

189
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,320
that they're the most sheltered spoiled middle aged infants that our species has ever produced.

190
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,120
You should be getting over being told to clean up your own messes when you're like 10 years

191
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,040
old unless of course you never got told and constantly had it done for you.

192
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,600
It can be legitimately traumatic to have to learn a child's lessons at 25 or 30 or 35

193
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
years old.

194
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,200
And I do think that a general extended childhood and extended adolescence means that people

195
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,360
get traumatized by things that even if they're not good or positive, they should be used

196
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
to by now.

197
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,520
Let me give you an example of this.

198
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,000
This is a short clip that went viral last year of a nerdy girl getting hit on by a guy.

199
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,640
She includes captions at different parts of the video describing how she feels at certain

200
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,360
moments, which I'll read out for you when they pop up just in case you're doing audio

201
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,600
only on this video.

202
00:09:38,600 --> 00:10:00,000
Here we go.

203
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:25,280
It's a fake name.

204
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:34,160
The no thank you is in reply to a handshake.

205
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:43,480
My heart is beating out of my chest right now.

206
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:52,640
Maybe he'll leave me alone if I say I'm live.

207
00:10:52,640 --> 00:11:08,880
He leans back but then he leaves as he sees I'm uncomfortable.

208
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:27,240
Man, that was cringe.

209
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,360
I cringed watching it.

210
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,360
I cringed writing this part of the script.

211
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,300
I'm cringing while recording it and I bet I'm going to cringe while editing it too.

212
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,080
That was one cringey interaction, but let's think about it for a bit.

213
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,760
The woman who took the video uses the language, the man that saves me is a friend.

214
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,920
He saved you from a cringey interaction, sure, but as far as I can remember, this person

215
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,420
who posted the video later claimed to be traumatized by this event.

216
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,240
Let's lay it out in as much autistic detail as I can.

217
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,280
From the guy's point of view, it should have been very obvious that she was uncomfortable

218
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,880
and he should have picked up that she wasn't interested much sooner than he did.

219
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,520
The encounter lasts maybe a minute and 30 seconds.

220
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,500
He probably should have figured it out at around the 30 second mark, but you know what?

221
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,240
He showed up, he shot his shot, he failed and then he left.

222
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
He didn't cause a scene.

223
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,240
He didn't insult her.

224
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,240
He was polite.

225
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,000
He said, got it, have a nice day and he took off.

226
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,600
I don't think this qualifies as a traumatic experience.

227
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,140
It's cringey and uncomfortable, sure, but not traumatic.

228
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,880
He got the point and left pretty quick.

229
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,000
Maybe not quick enough to avoid being turned into a viral video, but certainly not on the

230
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,920
level of inflicting trauma.

231
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,680
Like if this was some kind of an incredibly challenging event for her, she's got to

232
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,780
either have some past trauma that she hasn't dealt with or she's never ever ever ever

233
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,320
been in an awkward situation in her life and doesn't know how to deal with things.

234
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,640
I feel like in my day, yeah here's your boomer dev story, but in my day, if this shit

235
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,520
happened when I was in high school, the worst of it would be that the girl would laugh with

236
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,480
her friends about this creepy guy who tried to pick her up and didn't get the hint and

237
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,920
it was kind of weird and that would be the end of it.

238
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,480
But nowadays it's more like, I'll get back to you guys, one sec while I schedule an emergency

239
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,900
session with my fucking therapist after I Instagram and tweet out this horrifically

240
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,720
traumatizing encounter which serves as even more proof that women are relegated to second

241
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,020
class citizens in today's white patriarchal capitalist society.

242
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,640
Things that push back on you, even things that make you legitimately uncomfortable,

243
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,480
do not necessarily cause trauma.

244
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,840
But because there is this progressive compulsion to blame systems for every single problem

245
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,560
rather than individuals, systemic change is what's needed and people have no agency themselves

246
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,600
because they're oppressed, we've got an entire group of people who have exactly zero

247
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,920
tools to deal with even the most minimally invasive situations.

248
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,480
This is the case with anything progressive, the feminists who are legally of age but still

249
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,840
act like 12 year old retarded children because they want empowerment and equality when it

250
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,300
suits them but they don't want the responsibility and agency that comes with it.

251
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,800
Black activists who screech and cry about racism but are racist towards white people

252
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,720
and rather than fix their shitty behavior, they redefine the word racist to make them

253
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
blameless.

254
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,200
Trans activists who move beyond the reasonable ask of, let me transition because it alleviates

255
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,240
my dysphoria, off into the craziest self ID shit I've ever heard.

256
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,120
At the end of the day, it's all in the name of trauma, of harm reduction.

257
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,800
For these people, if useful labels or categories have to go, if free speech has to go, then

258
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
so be it.

259
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,000
No, really, they outright say it.

260
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,480
You can apply any label to yourself while ignoring its requirements, then what the fuck

261
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,700
is the point of the label?

262
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,840
Also implicit in this idea is that if you apply a label to yourself, even with zero

263
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,720
justification, I am now required to honor that no matter how ridiculous, all in the

264
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,400
name of preventing trauma.

265
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,960
When most of the time, the trauma is literally just the pain of learning an uncomfortable

266
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,240
life lesson 20 years too late.

267
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,040
But I just don't agree with this.

268
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,160
It would be polite of me to use your pronouns, but you don't get to compel me to do it.

269
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,640
And there's no reason anybody should comply with these obviously politically biased redefinitions

270
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,040
and replacements of perfectly functional words.

271
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,600
Here is what complying gets you.

272
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,340
You become party to a culture of weakness, where for a large swath of young people nowadays,

273
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,880
trauma is no longer considered a horrible thing to overcome, but a permanent part of

274
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,340
their personality, something to show off, something to put in their Twitter bio.

275
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,720
You contribute to the mechanisms that control a traumatized population for another group's

276
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,760
own political and personal gain, like, for example, the BLM organization, which exists

277
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,280
solely to enrich its operators with the donations of self-hating white leftists, using the legitimate

278
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,000
trauma of the black community as an excuse to do so.

279
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,560
And you contribute to the dumbing down of the language of trauma, such that actual victims

280
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,660
of trauma have their legitimately horrific experiences correlated with man-children who

281
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,320
hyperventilate trying to order a pizza over the phone.

282
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,720
All of that is too high a price to pay in exchange for a drop of temporary comfort quickly

283
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,460
consumed and forgotten about by the most coddle generation of human beings to ever

284
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,360
grace this planet.
