00:00.000 --> 00:10.840
In yesterday's video I talked about how inclusive language functions as aristocratic language.

00:10.840 --> 00:15.000
Its deliberate opaqueness serves as a barrier between those with the correct politics and

00:15.000 --> 00:19.960
the normies who are browbeat with over-educated redefinitions not based in reality any time

00:19.960 --> 00:21.000
they step out of line.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.160
I mentioned specifically that this mentality trickles down from academia into other institutions,

00:26.160 --> 00:28.320
often with hilarious or ridiculous results.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.000
Let's take a look at some examples.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.920
You know, part of me misses the days when all we had to worry about was forced gender

00:33.920 --> 00:37.960
neutrality upon things that didn't need it, like manhole turning into maintenance hole.

00:37.960 --> 00:42.580
I remember hearing as a kid, fireman and policeman becoming firefighter and police officer, and

00:42.580 --> 00:46.000
thinking, okay that makes sense, if there are women qualified to be in those jobs, why

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
not?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
But then it went off the rails.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.800
Sorority and fraternity should be called the collegiate Greek system residents, eh?

00:52.800 --> 00:57.360
In an effort to be trans-friendly, a hospital is advising nurses to no longer use words

00:57.360 --> 00:59.760
such as breast feeding and breast milk.

00:59.760 --> 01:04.120
Human milk and chest milk are the more acceptable terms for midwives to use.

01:04.120 --> 01:06.020
Gosh, starting off strong, eh?

01:06.020 --> 01:10.280
This video's ain't getting monetized, hit up my subscribestar and Patreon, everybody.

01:10.280 --> 01:15.200
Also, um, human milk has a completely different alternate meaning, one that I would hope doesn't

01:15.200 --> 01:17.120
involve babies drinking it.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.460
Do vulva owners like sex?

01:19.460 --> 01:20.600
It's the wrong question.

01:20.600 --> 01:21.880
Here's what you should ask instead.

01:21.880 --> 01:25.580
Oh, I can think of a few questions already, like, do you mean women?

01:25.580 --> 01:27.940
Or why am I reading this nonsense?

01:27.940 --> 01:28.940
What's the short answer?

01:28.940 --> 01:30.040
It depends on the person.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.720
Some do like sex and some don't.

01:31.720 --> 01:35.220
Just like some penis owners like sex and some don't.

01:35.220 --> 01:39.660
You know, I'm actually like picturing a female esports person with the nickname the penis

01:39.660 --> 01:43.980
owner, because she's got a reputation for smack talking guys during the match and then

01:43.980 --> 01:45.540
winning and bragging about it.

01:45.540 --> 01:50.020
Does that mean that vulva owners and penis owners are truly wired differently?

01:50.020 --> 01:52.940
I think you've got to be wired differently to even write this thing, man.

01:52.940 --> 01:54.560
It's not even inaccurate so far.

01:54.560 --> 01:59.720
It's all biologically on point, but it feels like they ran a word replace script and input

01:59.720 --> 02:01.700
vulva owner and penis owner.

02:01.700 --> 02:05.840
For centuries, those with vulvas have had their sex and sexuality controlled by those

02:05.840 --> 02:07.040
with penises.

02:07.040 --> 02:10.680
This likely started in the agricultural age when women's bodies were traded for land.

02:10.680 --> 02:11.680
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:11.680 --> 02:14.020
It didn't start because people traded women's bodies for land.

02:14.020 --> 02:17.680
It started because men's prehistorical burden is to work.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.840
And if men were going to work, they wanted at least some guarantee that the children

02:20.840 --> 02:22.700
they were working for were theirs.

02:22.700 --> 02:26.900
So institutions like marriage and monogamy helped provide this assurance.

02:26.900 --> 02:30.140
Most men were not these giga chads with 50 concubines.

02:30.140 --> 02:31.580
Most men were like most women.

02:31.580 --> 02:32.580
They were married.

02:32.580 --> 02:33.580
And that was that.

02:33.580 --> 02:39.100
Hey, fellow ovary owners and PCOS strugglers, ovary owners is degrading and dehumanizing.

02:39.100 --> 02:40.100
Come on now.

02:40.100 --> 02:45.520
So as female girls, ladies, sisters, any other transphobic slur that denies one their fundamental

02:45.520 --> 02:49.120
rights to their own gender identity, trans people have the right to not have their gender

02:49.120 --> 02:50.120
identity erased.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.120
All right.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.920
We can't call anything anything then.

02:52.920 --> 02:55.400
We can't use a term to identify a thing because that's othering.

02:55.400 --> 02:58.320
We just need to pretend that nothing exists and everything is everything.

02:58.320 --> 03:00.560
Stop calling it female genital mutilation.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.440
Vulvas aren't inherently female.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.400
If you call it FGM, you're a bigot.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.400
Bye, TERFs.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.440
I wonder if this is the person who wrote the vulva owner's article from earlier.

03:08.440 --> 03:10.200
Also, this take doesn't even make sense.

03:10.200 --> 03:15.200
If woman is the gender role and female is the biological sex, how are vulvas not inherently

03:15.200 --> 03:16.200
female?

03:16.200 --> 03:20.000
I thought the whole trans thing wasn't about saying biological sexes aren't real.

03:20.000 --> 03:28.600
The reason that a phrase like born biologically male is so upsetting to trans people is, number

03:28.600 --> 03:35.960
one, biology is a lot more complicated than you were taught in high school.

03:35.960 --> 03:44.040
And number two, false concepts of what is biologically true for human beings has been

03:44.040 --> 03:49.120
used as a tool of oppression for our whole history.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.160
Oh, never mind then.

03:50.160 --> 03:54.800
I guess some of the more radical trans activists really are about denying biological sex outright.

03:54.800 --> 03:59.840
Oh wow, a new campaign has been launched in support of genderless menstrual leave.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.840
People who bleed.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.720
I wish I still worked a normie job.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.240
I'd claim one week off every month for menstruation.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.240
Hell yeah.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.520
I mean, literally everybody is a person who bleeds.

04:08.520 --> 04:09.520
So why not?

04:09.520 --> 04:12.240
Here's probably the craziest example of all this I've come across so far.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.240
Buckle up.

04:13.240 --> 04:15.960
Vagina is when it's surgically constructed out of a penis.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.800
Front hole is when we were born with it.

04:17.800 --> 04:18.800
Holy shit.

04:19.480 --> 04:20.480
You hear that, cis woman?

04:20.480 --> 04:22.120
You've all got front holes now.

04:22.120 --> 04:25.720
Vagina is a word only for post-op trans women now.

04:25.720 --> 04:26.720
Vagina.

04:26.720 --> 04:29.840
We use this word to talk about the genitals of trans women who have had bottom surgery.

04:29.840 --> 04:33.080
Oh no, we fucking don't, that's not how any of this works.

04:33.080 --> 04:36.440
Like, I remember when this sort of a thing was a fucking joke.

04:36.440 --> 04:39.620
I remember when Borat called his butthole a back pussy.

04:39.620 --> 04:40.880
What the fuck is wrong with you?

04:40.880 --> 04:42.800
Here's the issue with all of this stuff.

04:42.800 --> 04:46.660
Yes, you're making things more inclusive, but you're also stripping the word of meaning

04:46.660 --> 04:47.800
in the process.

04:47.800 --> 04:52.560
For example, the word spouse might be a gender neutral alternative for husband, but spouse

04:52.560 --> 04:55.940
doesn't have the extra emotional attachment that husband has.

04:55.940 --> 04:57.220
Spouse is a legal term.

04:57.220 --> 05:01.560
Husband is a position that a man occupies, with certain duties, expectations, privileges,

05:01.560 --> 05:02.560
and rewards.

05:02.560 --> 05:03.560
Same with wife.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.320
Same with partner, replacing boyfriend and girlfriend.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.160
And sibling, replacing brother and sister.

05:07.160 --> 05:09.100
And parent, replacing father and mother.

05:09.100 --> 05:13.080
Because it turns out, women and men aren't exactly the same at all times.

05:13.080 --> 05:16.020
Oh god, check out this list of gender neutral terms.

05:16.020 --> 05:17.400
Ren replaces mom and dad?

05:17.400 --> 05:18.640
I've never heard this before.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.280
I've heard parent, not ren.

05:20.280 --> 05:22.400
ZZ for aunt and uncle?

05:22.400 --> 05:24.560
Nibling for niece and nephew?

05:24.560 --> 05:25.560
Really nibba?

05:25.560 --> 05:27.440
Prinks for prince and princess?

05:27.440 --> 05:28.780
Latinx strikes again.

05:28.780 --> 05:33.320
It was a trans person who posted this to my timeline, with the caption, please just misgender

05:33.320 --> 05:34.320
me.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.640
Which is the same energy as Lilith saying, it's less insulting to call me a man than

05:37.640 --> 05:38.800
a womanxin.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.400
Most people, even most trans people, don't want this shit.

05:42.400 --> 05:47.320
For a long time, the actual real measures to force this nonsense was relegated to the

05:47.320 --> 05:50.240
stupid, put your pronouns in your bio or else crowd.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.560
Those people were annoying, but easily ignorable.

05:52.560 --> 05:57.680
But then it became culturally popular to cancel people who pushed back against this imposition.

05:57.680 --> 06:00.560
And then it became an offence to use normal everyday speech.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.720
And then cringey holidays about these pronouns became the norm.

06:03.720 --> 06:08.300
And then people began to reap social credit for simply adding a they into their bio.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.680
And then the police began promoting it actively.

06:10.680 --> 06:14.960
Being misgendered can have a huge impact on somebody and their personal wellbeing.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.800
It also can be used as a form of abuse for somebody.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.320
And that just isn't right.

06:19.320 --> 06:23.640
Today is about raising awareness, getting people to have conversations and understanding

06:23.640 --> 06:28.800
why it is so important to understand the pronouns that somebody wishes to be used for them.

06:28.800 --> 06:32.240
And then the police began to be called on people who didn't comply with it.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.360
It's not compelled speech, just shut up.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.780
Do you even hear yourself?

06:35.780 --> 06:38.200
It's not violating your free speech rights.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.800
Just don't speak, five head.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.320
And what is all this in service of?

06:41.320 --> 06:45.040
The redefinitions, the new speak, the rigid enforcement of pronouns to the point that

06:45.040 --> 06:46.320
the cops are being called up.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.320
What's it all for?

06:47.320 --> 06:49.200
Well, any progressive can answer that one.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.540
It's to minimize trauma, apparently.

06:51.540 --> 06:54.820
The claim is, if you're not using a trans person's preferred pronouns, regardless of

06:54.820 --> 06:59.520
how obviously outlandish they are, or if you're not using gender neutral terminology, even

06:59.520 --> 07:03.340
if it sounds ridiculous to your ears to say, or if you're making any reference to biology

07:03.340 --> 07:08.280
insofar as sex and gender are concerned, you are inflicting new traumas on marginalized

07:08.280 --> 07:11.600
people, you're triggering their past traumas, and you're hindering their recovery.

07:11.600 --> 07:15.780
Maybe you're listening to all this and thinking, ha, trauma, it's just hurt feelings.

07:15.780 --> 07:18.280
Is being offended a traumatic experience now?

07:18.280 --> 07:22.320
Well, I don't think so, but let's actually consider the possibility.

07:22.320 --> 07:26.600
My video on the pronouns Wiki included a funny throwaway joke that we should actually take

07:26.600 --> 07:27.800
a bit of a closer look at.

07:27.800 --> 07:31.960
At the end of it, I said, shut up and do your dishes while presenting this picture.

07:31.960 --> 07:36.320
When you ask your NB, that means non-binary, roommate with a noun for a name to clean up

07:36.320 --> 07:41.160
after themselves, then they post a GoFundMe to get out of their abusive housing situation.

07:41.160 --> 07:44.960
This reminds me of an old, old viral post, I can't find it now, it's been lost to the

07:44.960 --> 07:47.880
depths of the internet, where a woman was living with an abusive boyfriend.

07:47.880 --> 07:50.720
But what made him abusive was that he asked her to get a job.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.400
She said something like, I'm an abuse survivor, I got out.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.400
Know that you're not alone.

07:54.400 --> 07:58.100
And it's like, dude, are you really just out here weaponizing the language of trauma because

07:58.100 --> 08:01.160
you're too lazy to pick up after yourself or contribute to the household?

08:01.160 --> 08:05.680
Well, that abusive housing situation from last time is actually a viral TikTok.

08:05.680 --> 08:06.820
Of course, how could it not be?

08:06.820 --> 08:08.320
And the replies to it are gold.

08:08.320 --> 08:12.740
A lot of them are people screeching, transphobia, because apparently it's transphobic to not

08:12.740 --> 08:14.520
want to live in a fucking toilet.

08:14.520 --> 08:17.100
Ask yourself why all the replies contain transphobia.

08:17.100 --> 08:20.840
The answer is because where you see trans person, I see overgrown child.

08:20.840 --> 08:24.220
But some replies contain their own stories like this one, got to get out of this they

08:24.220 --> 08:25.220
them household.

08:25.220 --> 08:29.160
One of my roommates gets away with never doing dishes, citing housing trauma that makes them

08:29.160 --> 08:32.320
hypersensitive to people asking them to do dishes, honestly, kind of alpha.

08:32.320 --> 08:36.680
I was mowing it over in my head for a while thinking, do these people actually experience

08:36.680 --> 08:38.760
trauma when being asked to do the dishes?

08:38.760 --> 08:42.720
Or is it just laziness and they know they're being lazy and they're hiding behind the language

08:42.720 --> 08:43.720
of trauma.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.760
And I've come to the conclusion that it's both.

08:45.760 --> 08:46.760
They're certainly lazy.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.240
They're your dishes, you do them.

08:48.240 --> 08:51.800
There's no reason anybody else should be obligated to pick up after you, but they're probably

08:51.800 --> 08:53.560
also a little traumatized.

08:53.560 --> 08:58.400
And to be traumatized from such a minute amount of pushback as please do your own dishes means

08:58.400 --> 09:03.320
that they're the most sheltered spoiled middle aged infants that our species has ever produced.

09:03.320 --> 09:07.120
You should be getting over being told to clean up your own messes when you're like 10 years

09:07.120 --> 09:11.040
old unless of course you never got told and constantly had it done for you.

09:11.040 --> 09:15.600
It can be legitimately traumatic to have to learn a child's lessons at 25 or 30 or 35

09:15.600 --> 09:16.600
years old.

09:16.600 --> 09:20.200
And I do think that a general extended childhood and extended adolescence means that people

09:20.200 --> 09:24.360
get traumatized by things that even if they're not good or positive, they should be used

09:24.360 --> 09:25.360
to by now.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.520
Let me give you an example of this.

09:26.520 --> 09:31.000
This is a short clip that went viral last year of a nerdy girl getting hit on by a guy.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.640
She includes captions at different parts of the video describing how she feels at certain

09:34.640 --> 09:37.360
moments, which I'll read out for you when they pop up just in case you're doing audio

09:37.360 --> 09:38.600
only on this video.

09:38.600 --> 10:00.000
Here we go.

10:00.000 --> 10:25.280
It's a fake name.

10:25.280 --> 10:34.160
The no thank you is in reply to a handshake.

10:34.160 --> 10:43.480
My heart is beating out of my chest right now.

10:43.480 --> 10:52.640
Maybe he'll leave me alone if I say I'm live.

10:52.640 --> 11:08.880
He leans back but then he leaves as he sees I'm uncomfortable.

11:08.880 --> 11:27.240
Man, that was cringe.

11:27.240 --> 11:28.360
I cringed watching it.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.360
I cringed writing this part of the script.

11:30.360 --> 11:34.300
I'm cringing while recording it and I bet I'm going to cringe while editing it too.

11:34.300 --> 11:37.080
That was one cringey interaction, but let's think about it for a bit.

11:37.080 --> 11:40.760
The woman who took the video uses the language, the man that saves me is a friend.

11:40.760 --> 11:43.920
He saved you from a cringey interaction, sure, but as far as I can remember, this person

11:43.920 --> 11:47.420
who posted the video later claimed to be traumatized by this event.

11:47.420 --> 11:50.240
Let's lay it out in as much autistic detail as I can.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.280
From the guy's point of view, it should have been very obvious that she was uncomfortable

11:53.280 --> 11:56.880
and he should have picked up that she wasn't interested much sooner than he did.

11:56.880 --> 11:59.520
The encounter lasts maybe a minute and 30 seconds.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.500
He probably should have figured it out at around the 30 second mark, but you know what?

12:02.500 --> 12:05.240
He showed up, he shot his shot, he failed and then he left.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.240
He didn't cause a scene.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.240
He didn't insult her.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.240
He was polite.

12:08.240 --> 12:10.000
He said, got it, have a nice day and he took off.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.600
I don't think this qualifies as a traumatic experience.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.140
It's cringey and uncomfortable, sure, but not traumatic.

12:15.140 --> 12:16.880
He got the point and left pretty quick.

12:16.880 --> 12:20.000
Maybe not quick enough to avoid being turned into a viral video, but certainly not on the

12:20.000 --> 12:21.920
level of inflicting trauma.

12:21.920 --> 12:25.680
Like if this was some kind of an incredibly challenging event for her, she's got to

12:25.680 --> 12:29.780
either have some past trauma that she hasn't dealt with or she's never ever ever ever

12:29.780 --> 12:33.320
been in an awkward situation in her life and doesn't know how to deal with things.

12:33.320 --> 12:37.640
I feel like in my day, yeah here's your boomer dev story, but in my day, if this shit

12:37.640 --> 12:40.520
happened when I was in high school, the worst of it would be that the girl would laugh with

12:40.520 --> 12:43.480
her friends about this creepy guy who tried to pick her up and didn't get the hint and

12:43.480 --> 12:44.920
it was kind of weird and that would be the end of it.

12:44.920 --> 12:48.480
But nowadays it's more like, I'll get back to you guys, one sec while I schedule an emergency

12:48.480 --> 12:51.900
session with my fucking therapist after I Instagram and tweet out this horrifically

12:51.900 --> 12:55.720
traumatizing encounter which serves as even more proof that women are relegated to second

12:55.720 --> 12:59.020
class citizens in today's white patriarchal capitalist society.

12:59.020 --> 13:02.640
Things that push back on you, even things that make you legitimately uncomfortable,

13:02.640 --> 13:04.480
do not necessarily cause trauma.

13:04.480 --> 13:08.840
But because there is this progressive compulsion to blame systems for every single problem

13:08.840 --> 13:12.560
rather than individuals, systemic change is what's needed and people have no agency themselves

13:12.560 --> 13:16.600
because they're oppressed, we've got an entire group of people who have exactly zero

13:16.600 --> 13:20.920
tools to deal with even the most minimally invasive situations.

13:20.920 --> 13:25.480
This is the case with anything progressive, the feminists who are legally of age but still

13:25.480 --> 13:29.840
act like 12 year old retarded children because they want empowerment and equality when it

13:29.840 --> 13:33.300
suits them but they don't want the responsibility and agency that comes with it.

13:33.300 --> 13:36.800
Black activists who screech and cry about racism but are racist towards white people

13:36.800 --> 13:40.720
and rather than fix their shitty behavior, they redefine the word racist to make them

13:40.720 --> 13:41.720
blameless.

13:41.720 --> 13:46.200
Trans activists who move beyond the reasonable ask of, let me transition because it alleviates

13:46.200 --> 13:50.240
my dysphoria, off into the craziest self ID shit I've ever heard.

13:50.240 --> 13:54.120
At the end of the day, it's all in the name of trauma, of harm reduction.

13:54.120 --> 13:58.800
For these people, if useful labels or categories have to go, if free speech has to go, then

13:58.800 --> 13:59.800
so be it.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.000
No, really, they outright say it.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.480
You can apply any label to yourself while ignoring its requirements, then what the fuck

14:04.480 --> 14:05.700
is the point of the label?

14:05.700 --> 14:09.840
Also implicit in this idea is that if you apply a label to yourself, even with zero

14:09.840 --> 14:13.720
justification, I am now required to honor that no matter how ridiculous, all in the

14:13.720 --> 14:15.400
name of preventing trauma.

14:15.400 --> 14:18.960
When most of the time, the trauma is literally just the pain of learning an uncomfortable

14:18.960 --> 14:21.240
life lesson 20 years too late.

14:21.240 --> 14:23.040
But I just don't agree with this.

14:23.040 --> 14:27.160
It would be polite of me to use your pronouns, but you don't get to compel me to do it.

14:27.160 --> 14:31.640
And there's no reason anybody should comply with these obviously politically biased redefinitions

14:31.640 --> 14:34.040
and replacements of perfectly functional words.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.600
Here is what complying gets you.

14:35.600 --> 14:40.340
You become party to a culture of weakness, where for a large swath of young people nowadays,

14:40.340 --> 14:43.880
trauma is no longer considered a horrible thing to overcome, but a permanent part of

14:43.880 --> 14:47.340
their personality, something to show off, something to put in their Twitter bio.

14:47.340 --> 14:51.720
You contribute to the mechanisms that control a traumatized population for another group's

14:51.720 --> 14:56.760
own political and personal gain, like, for example, the BLM organization, which exists

14:56.760 --> 15:01.280
solely to enrich its operators with the donations of self-hating white leftists, using the legitimate

15:01.280 --> 15:04.000
trauma of the black community as an excuse to do so.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.560
And you contribute to the dumbing down of the language of trauma, such that actual victims

15:07.560 --> 15:11.660
of trauma have their legitimately horrific experiences correlated with man-children who

15:11.660 --> 15:14.320
hyperventilate trying to order a pizza over the phone.

15:14.320 --> 15:18.720
All of that is too high a price to pay in exchange for a drop of temporary comfort quickly

15:18.720 --> 15:22.460
consumed and forgotten about by the most coddle generation of human beings to ever

15:22.460 --> 15:23.360
grace this planet.
