0	10840	In yesterday's video I talked about how inclusive language functions as aristocratic language.
10840	15000	Its deliberate opaqueness serves as a barrier between those with the correct politics and
15000	19960	the normies who are browbeat with over-educated redefinitions not based in reality any time
19960	21000	they step out of line.
21000	26160	I mentioned specifically that this mentality trickles down from academia into other institutions,
26160	28320	often with hilarious or ridiculous results.
28320	30000	Let's take a look at some examples.
30000	33920	You know, part of me misses the days when all we had to worry about was forced gender
33920	37960	neutrality upon things that didn't need it, like manhole turning into maintenance hole.
37960	42580	I remember hearing as a kid, fireman and policeman becoming firefighter and police officer, and
42580	46000	thinking, okay that makes sense, if there are women qualified to be in those jobs, why
46000	47000	not?
47000	48000	But then it went off the rails.
48000	52800	Sorority and fraternity should be called the collegiate Greek system residents, eh?
52800	57360	In an effort to be trans-friendly, a hospital is advising nurses to no longer use words
57360	59760	such as breast feeding and breast milk.
59760	64120	Human milk and chest milk are the more acceptable terms for midwives to use.
64120	66020	Gosh, starting off strong, eh?
66020	70280	This video's ain't getting monetized, hit up my subscribestar and Patreon, everybody.
70280	75200	Also, um, human milk has a completely different alternate meaning, one that I would hope doesn't
75200	77120	involve babies drinking it.
77120	79460	Do vulva owners like sex?
79460	80600	It's the wrong question.
80600	81880	Here's what you should ask instead.
81880	85580	Oh, I can think of a few questions already, like, do you mean women?
85580	87940	Or why am I reading this nonsense?
87940	88940	What's the short answer?
88940	90040	It depends on the person.
90040	91720	Some do like sex and some don't.
91720	95220	Just like some penis owners like sex and some don't.
95220	99660	You know, I'm actually like picturing a female esports person with the nickname the penis
99660	103980	owner, because she's got a reputation for smack talking guys during the match and then
103980	105540	winning and bragging about it.
105540	110020	Does that mean that vulva owners and penis owners are truly wired differently?
110020	112940	I think you've got to be wired differently to even write this thing, man.
112940	114560	It's not even inaccurate so far.
114560	119720	It's all biologically on point, but it feels like they ran a word replace script and input
119720	121700	vulva owner and penis owner.
121700	125840	For centuries, those with vulvas have had their sex and sexuality controlled by those
125840	127040	with penises.
127040	130680	This likely started in the agricultural age when women's bodies were traded for land.
130680	131680	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
131680	134020	It didn't start because people traded women's bodies for land.
134020	137680	It started because men's prehistorical burden is to work.
137680	140840	And if men were going to work, they wanted at least some guarantee that the children
140840	142700	they were working for were theirs.
142700	146900	So institutions like marriage and monogamy helped provide this assurance.
146900	150140	Most men were not these giga chads with 50 concubines.
150140	151580	Most men were like most women.
151580	152580	They were married.
152580	153580	And that was that.
153580	159100	Hey, fellow ovary owners and PCOS strugglers, ovary owners is degrading and dehumanizing.
159100	160100	Come on now.
160100	165520	So as female girls, ladies, sisters, any other transphobic slur that denies one their fundamental
165520	169120	rights to their own gender identity, trans people have the right to not have their gender
169120	170120	identity erased.
170120	171120	All right.
171120	172920	We can't call anything anything then.
172920	175400	We can't use a term to identify a thing because that's othering.
175400	178320	We just need to pretend that nothing exists and everything is everything.
178320	180560	Stop calling it female genital mutilation.
180560	182440	Vulvas aren't inherently female.
182440	184400	If you call it FGM, you're a bigot.
184400	185400	Bye, TERFs.
185400	188440	I wonder if this is the person who wrote the vulva owner's article from earlier.
188440	190200	Also, this take doesn't even make sense.
190200	195200	If woman is the gender role and female is the biological sex, how are vulvas not inherently
195200	196200	female?
196200	200000	I thought the whole trans thing wasn't about saying biological sexes aren't real.
200000	208600	The reason that a phrase like born biologically male is so upsetting to trans people is, number
208600	215960	one, biology is a lot more complicated than you were taught in high school.
215960	224040	And number two, false concepts of what is biologically true for human beings has been
224040	229120	used as a tool of oppression for our whole history.
229120	230160	Oh, never mind then.
230160	234800	I guess some of the more radical trans activists really are about denying biological sex outright.
234800	239840	Oh wow, a new campaign has been launched in support of genderless menstrual leave.
239840	240840	People who bleed.
240840	242720	I wish I still worked a normie job.
242720	245240	I'd claim one week off every month for menstruation.
245240	246240	Hell yeah.
246240	248520	I mean, literally everybody is a person who bleeds.
248520	249520	So why not?
249520	252240	Here's probably the craziest example of all this I've come across so far.
252240	253240	Buckle up.
253240	255960	Vagina is when it's surgically constructed out of a penis.
255960	257800	Front hole is when we were born with it.
257800	258800	Holy shit.
259480	260480	You hear that, cis woman?
260480	262120	You've all got front holes now.
262120	265720	Vagina is a word only for post-op trans women now.
265720	266720	Vagina.
266720	269840	We use this word to talk about the genitals of trans women who have had bottom surgery.
269840	273080	Oh no, we fucking don't, that's not how any of this works.
273080	276440	Like, I remember when this sort of a thing was a fucking joke.
276440	279620	I remember when Borat called his butthole a back pussy.
279620	280880	What the fuck is wrong with you?
280880	282800	Here's the issue with all of this stuff.
282800	286660	Yes, you're making things more inclusive, but you're also stripping the word of meaning
286660	287800	in the process.
287800	292560	For example, the word spouse might be a gender neutral alternative for husband, but spouse
292560	295940	doesn't have the extra emotional attachment that husband has.
295940	297220	Spouse is a legal term.
297220	301560	Husband is a position that a man occupies, with certain duties, expectations, privileges,
301560	302560	and rewards.
302560	303560	Same with wife.
303560	305320	Same with partner, replacing boyfriend and girlfriend.
305320	307160	And sibling, replacing brother and sister.
307160	309100	And parent, replacing father and mother.
309100	313080	Because it turns out, women and men aren't exactly the same at all times.
313080	316020	Oh god, check out this list of gender neutral terms.
316020	317400	Ren replaces mom and dad?
317400	318640	I've never heard this before.
318640	320280	I've heard parent, not ren.
320280	322400	ZZ for aunt and uncle?
322400	324560	Nibling for niece and nephew?
324560	325560	Really nibba?
325560	327440	Prinks for prince and princess?
327440	328780	Latinx strikes again.
328780	333320	It was a trans person who posted this to my timeline, with the caption, please just misgender
333320	334320	me.
334320	337640	Which is the same energy as Lilith saying, it's less insulting to call me a man than
337640	338800	a womanxin.
338800	342400	Most people, even most trans people, don't want this shit.
342400	347320	For a long time, the actual real measures to force this nonsense was relegated to the
347320	350240	stupid, put your pronouns in your bio or else crowd.
350240	352560	Those people were annoying, but easily ignorable.
352560	357680	But then it became culturally popular to cancel people who pushed back against this imposition.
357680	360560	And then it became an offence to use normal everyday speech.
360560	363720	And then cringey holidays about these pronouns became the norm.
363720	368300	And then people began to reap social credit for simply adding a they into their bio.
368300	370680	And then the police began promoting it actively.
370680	374960	Being misgendered can have a huge impact on somebody and their personal wellbeing.
374960	377800	It also can be used as a form of abuse for somebody.
377800	379320	And that just isn't right.
379320	383640	Today is about raising awareness, getting people to have conversations and understanding
383640	388800	why it is so important to understand the pronouns that somebody wishes to be used for them.
388800	392240	And then the police began to be called on people who didn't comply with it.
392240	394360	It's not compelled speech, just shut up.
394360	395780	Do you even hear yourself?
395780	398200	It's not violating your free speech rights.
398200	399800	Just don't speak, five head.
399800	401320	And what is all this in service of?
401320	405040	The redefinitions, the new speak, the rigid enforcement of pronouns to the point that
405040	406320	the cops are being called up.
406320	407320	What's it all for?
407320	409200	Well, any progressive can answer that one.
409200	411540	It's to minimize trauma, apparently.
411540	414820	The claim is, if you're not using a trans person's preferred pronouns, regardless of
414820	419520	how obviously outlandish they are, or if you're not using gender neutral terminology, even
419520	423340	if it sounds ridiculous to your ears to say, or if you're making any reference to biology
423340	428280	insofar as sex and gender are concerned, you are inflicting new traumas on marginalized
428280	431600	people, you're triggering their past traumas, and you're hindering their recovery.
431600	435780	Maybe you're listening to all this and thinking, ha, trauma, it's just hurt feelings.
435780	438280	Is being offended a traumatic experience now?
438280	442320	Well, I don't think so, but let's actually consider the possibility.
442320	446600	My video on the pronouns Wiki included a funny throwaway joke that we should actually take
446600	447800	a bit of a closer look at.
447800	451960	At the end of it, I said, shut up and do your dishes while presenting this picture.
451960	456320	When you ask your NB, that means non-binary, roommate with a noun for a name to clean up
456320	461160	after themselves, then they post a GoFundMe to get out of their abusive housing situation.
461160	464960	This reminds me of an old, old viral post, I can't find it now, it's been lost to the
464960	467880	depths of the internet, where a woman was living with an abusive boyfriend.
467880	470720	But what made him abusive was that he asked her to get a job.
470720	473400	She said something like, I'm an abuse survivor, I got out.
473400	474400	Know that you're not alone.
474400	478100	And it's like, dude, are you really just out here weaponizing the language of trauma because
478100	481160	you're too lazy to pick up after yourself or contribute to the household?
481160	485680	Well, that abusive housing situation from last time is actually a viral TikTok.
485680	486820	Of course, how could it not be?
486820	488320	And the replies to it are gold.
488320	492740	A lot of them are people screeching, transphobia, because apparently it's transphobic to not
492740	494520	want to live in a fucking toilet.
494520	497100	Ask yourself why all the replies contain transphobia.
497100	500840	The answer is because where you see trans person, I see overgrown child.
500840	504220	But some replies contain their own stories like this one, got to get out of this they
504220	505220	them household.
505220	509160	One of my roommates gets away with never doing dishes, citing housing trauma that makes them
509160	512320	hypersensitive to people asking them to do dishes, honestly, kind of alpha.
512320	516680	I was mowing it over in my head for a while thinking, do these people actually experience
516680	518760	trauma when being asked to do the dishes?
518760	522720	Or is it just laziness and they know they're being lazy and they're hiding behind the language
522720	523720	of trauma.
523720	525760	And I've come to the conclusion that it's both.
525760	526760	They're certainly lazy.
526760	528240	They're your dishes, you do them.
528240	531800	There's no reason anybody else should be obligated to pick up after you, but they're probably
531800	533560	also a little traumatized.
533560	538400	And to be traumatized from such a minute amount of pushback as please do your own dishes means
538400	543320	that they're the most sheltered spoiled middle aged infants that our species has ever produced.
543320	547120	You should be getting over being told to clean up your own messes when you're like 10 years
547120	551040	old unless of course you never got told and constantly had it done for you.
551040	555600	It can be legitimately traumatic to have to learn a child's lessons at 25 or 30 or 35
555600	556600	years old.
556600	560200	And I do think that a general extended childhood and extended adolescence means that people
560200	564360	get traumatized by things that even if they're not good or positive, they should be used
564360	565360	to by now.
565360	566520	Let me give you an example of this.
566520	571000	This is a short clip that went viral last year of a nerdy girl getting hit on by a guy.
571000	574640	She includes captions at different parts of the video describing how she feels at certain
574640	577360	moments, which I'll read out for you when they pop up just in case you're doing audio
577360	578600	only on this video.
578600	600000	Here we go.
600000	625280	It's a fake name.
625280	634160	The no thank you is in reply to a handshake.
634160	643480	My heart is beating out of my chest right now.
643480	652640	Maybe he'll leave me alone if I say I'm live.
652640	668880	He leans back but then he leaves as he sees I'm uncomfortable.
668880	687240	Man, that was cringe.
687240	688360	I cringed watching it.
688360	690360	I cringed writing this part of the script.
690360	694300	I'm cringing while recording it and I bet I'm going to cringe while editing it too.
694300	697080	That was one cringey interaction, but let's think about it for a bit.
697080	700760	The woman who took the video uses the language, the man that saves me is a friend.
700760	703920	He saved you from a cringey interaction, sure, but as far as I can remember, this person
703920	707420	who posted the video later claimed to be traumatized by this event.
707420	710240	Let's lay it out in as much autistic detail as I can.
710240	713280	From the guy's point of view, it should have been very obvious that she was uncomfortable
713280	716880	and he should have picked up that she wasn't interested much sooner than he did.
716880	719520	The encounter lasts maybe a minute and 30 seconds.
719520	722500	He probably should have figured it out at around the 30 second mark, but you know what?
722500	725240	He showed up, he shot his shot, he failed and then he left.
725240	726240	He didn't cause a scene.
726240	727240	He didn't insult her.
727240	728240	He was polite.
728240	730000	He said, got it, have a nice day and he took off.
730000	732600	I don't think this qualifies as a traumatic experience.
732600	735140	It's cringey and uncomfortable, sure, but not traumatic.
735140	736880	He got the point and left pretty quick.
736880	740000	Maybe not quick enough to avoid being turned into a viral video, but certainly not on the
740000	741920	level of inflicting trauma.
741920	745680	Like if this was some kind of an incredibly challenging event for her, she's got to
745680	749780	either have some past trauma that she hasn't dealt with or she's never ever ever ever
749780	753320	been in an awkward situation in her life and doesn't know how to deal with things.
753320	757640	I feel like in my day, yeah here's your boomer dev story, but in my day, if this shit
757640	760520	happened when I was in high school, the worst of it would be that the girl would laugh with
760520	763480	her friends about this creepy guy who tried to pick her up and didn't get the hint and
763480	764920	it was kind of weird and that would be the end of it.
764920	768480	But nowadays it's more like, I'll get back to you guys, one sec while I schedule an emergency
768480	771900	session with my fucking therapist after I Instagram and tweet out this horrifically
771900	775720	traumatizing encounter which serves as even more proof that women are relegated to second
775720	779020	class citizens in today's white patriarchal capitalist society.
779020	782640	Things that push back on you, even things that make you legitimately uncomfortable,
782640	784480	do not necessarily cause trauma.
784480	788840	But because there is this progressive compulsion to blame systems for every single problem
788840	792560	rather than individuals, systemic change is what's needed and people have no agency themselves
792560	796600	because they're oppressed, we've got an entire group of people who have exactly zero
796600	800920	tools to deal with even the most minimally invasive situations.
800920	805480	This is the case with anything progressive, the feminists who are legally of age but still
805480	809840	act like 12 year old retarded children because they want empowerment and equality when it
809840	813300	suits them but they don't want the responsibility and agency that comes with it.
813300	816800	Black activists who screech and cry about racism but are racist towards white people
816800	820720	and rather than fix their shitty behavior, they redefine the word racist to make them
820720	821720	blameless.
821720	826200	Trans activists who move beyond the reasonable ask of, let me transition because it alleviates
826200	830240	my dysphoria, off into the craziest self ID shit I've ever heard.
830240	834120	At the end of the day, it's all in the name of trauma, of harm reduction.
834120	838800	For these people, if useful labels or categories have to go, if free speech has to go, then
838800	839800	so be it.
839800	841000	No, really, they outright say it.
841000	844480	You can apply any label to yourself while ignoring its requirements, then what the fuck
844480	845700	is the point of the label?
845700	849840	Also implicit in this idea is that if you apply a label to yourself, even with zero
849840	853720	justification, I am now required to honor that no matter how ridiculous, all in the
853720	855400	name of preventing trauma.
855400	858960	When most of the time, the trauma is literally just the pain of learning an uncomfortable
858960	861240	life lesson 20 years too late.
861240	863040	But I just don't agree with this.
863040	867160	It would be polite of me to use your pronouns, but you don't get to compel me to do it.
867160	871640	And there's no reason anybody should comply with these obviously politically biased redefinitions
871640	874040	and replacements of perfectly functional words.
874040	875600	Here is what complying gets you.
875600	880340	You become party to a culture of weakness, where for a large swath of young people nowadays,
880340	883880	trauma is no longer considered a horrible thing to overcome, but a permanent part of
