00:00.000 --> 00:03.460
I figured I'd give you guys a quick update on what I'm doing today.

00:03.460 --> 00:08.400
In the next one to two weeks you're going to see a lot of my backlogged videos disappear

00:08.400 --> 00:10.320
off of the SFO channel.

00:10.320 --> 00:14.860
I'm doing this based on some advice that I've been given from multiple people who have gone

00:14.860 --> 00:16.860
through this process before.

00:16.860 --> 00:23.860
When YouTube examines your channel for re-monetization, they will often go through your entire backlog.

00:23.860 --> 00:29.980
So I'll be taking down all of the streams that I've done, as well as a few select videos.

00:29.980 --> 00:31.760
That doesn't mean they're going to be gone forever.

00:31.760 --> 00:37.640
The videos are still up on my bitshoot at bitshoot.com slash shortfatotaku.

00:37.640 --> 00:45.000
And if SFO's monetization is restored, those videos will instead be uploaded to the Devonitize

00:45.000 --> 00:47.220
channel I started a couple weeks ago.

00:47.220 --> 00:53.880
That channel will become basically the backlog for videos that are too edgy to get monetized.

00:53.880 --> 00:58.640
And how I plan to handle it is that there will be playlists on SFO for the various types

00:58.640 --> 00:59.660
of video.

00:59.660 --> 01:04.140
And if there's any holes in the backlog, it will simply link to the Devonitized version

01:04.140 --> 01:05.400
of that video.

01:05.400 --> 01:11.360
Also, for that re-monetization to happen, I have to keep my watch hours up.

01:11.360 --> 01:14.660
So if you've ever considered re-watching my old videos or checking out some stuff that

01:14.660 --> 01:19.060
you might have missed, the next week or two is probably a good time to do it.

01:19.060 --> 01:24.120
So the plan will be that the monetization comes back on SFO, the edgier videos will

01:24.120 --> 01:28.960
be on a side channel as well as on my bitshoot, and then will continue as normal.

01:28.960 --> 01:33.140
However, if it turns out that monetization just won't come back, and that's actually

01:33.140 --> 01:38.380
very rare, because one of the people that I talked to, he said that he applied and reapplied

01:38.380 --> 01:41.940
and reapplied over the course of six months, and eventually got his monetization back as

01:41.940 --> 01:46.100
he trimmed out more and more of his backlog, hopefully it won't take me six months.

01:46.100 --> 01:51.960
But if for some reason I find out that monetization just isn't coming back, well then I will have

01:51.960 --> 01:53.420
to start a new channel.

01:53.420 --> 01:58.720
SFO will probably become the backlog, and Devonatized will probably become the main

01:58.720 --> 02:00.640
channel where I'll upload new stuff.

02:00.640 --> 02:03.600
However, from what I've heard, I don't think I'm going to have to do that.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.760
There is at least an okay chance that things will turn out fine.

02:06.760 --> 02:10.120
As always, if you want to support, there is a Patreon and a Subscribestar.

02:10.120 --> 02:14.640
There's my affiliate links and Amazon equipment wishlist in the description of the video if

02:14.640 --> 02:16.080
you want to contribute that way.

02:16.080 --> 02:21.040
I still do the daily streams over on Game Boomers, that's twitch.tv slash Game Boomers.

02:21.040 --> 02:25.020
And since I'm a twitch affiliate, I do have monetization there, so you can also donate

02:25.020 --> 02:27.000
through their platform as well.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.380
And I plan to start those daily SFO streams tomorrow with the watching of the final debate

02:32.380 --> 02:37.300
with Lilith and Scrump, Scrump the guy who caused the problems in the first place.

02:37.300 --> 02:39.260
And we'll see who else we can get in there as well.

02:39.260 --> 02:43.860
So yeah, drop by tonight for the finale of Carrion, and drop by tomorrow night for the

02:43.860 --> 02:44.860
debate stream.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.140
I'll see you then.

02:46.140 --> 02:47.140
I love you.

02:47.140 --> 02:48.980
Oh wait, no, there's actually something else.

02:48.980 --> 02:50.340
Check this out, check this out.

02:50.340 --> 02:53.220
So I was in Lore Reloaded's stream.

02:53.220 --> 02:57.000
He's a Star Trek YouTuber, he's not political, and we're friends and stuff.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.320
But I was in there watching his stream, and he showed me this screenshot.

03:00.320 --> 03:06.360
Apparently all of my chats have to be manually approved now, whenever I'm on the SFO account.

03:06.360 --> 03:11.020
And I tried a few other chats on YouTube, and it's the exact same way everywhere else.

03:11.020 --> 03:15.140
It turns out that that is just how it is as long as I'm demonetized.

03:15.140 --> 03:18.620
Because I was demonetized for hate speech, even though it wasn't me actually doing the

03:18.620 --> 03:20.940
hate speech, Scrump.

03:20.940 --> 03:26.620
Until this is solved, this is what my YouTube chatting experience is going to look like.

03:26.620 --> 03:27.620
Thanks guys.
