0	3460	I figured I'd give you guys a quick update on what I'm doing today.
3460	8400	In the next one to two weeks you're going to see a lot of my backlogged videos disappear
8400	10320	off of the SFO channel.
10320	14860	I'm doing this based on some advice that I've been given from multiple people who have gone
14860	16860	through this process before.
16860	23860	When YouTube examines your channel for re-monetization, they will often go through your entire backlog.
23860	29980	So I'll be taking down all of the streams that I've done, as well as a few select videos.
29980	31760	That doesn't mean they're going to be gone forever.
31760	37640	The videos are still up on my bitshoot at bitshoot.com slash shortfatotaku.
37640	45000	And if SFO's monetization is restored, those videos will instead be uploaded to the Devonitize
45000	47220	channel I started a couple weeks ago.
47220	53880	That channel will become basically the backlog for videos that are too edgy to get monetized.
53880	58640	And how I plan to handle it is that there will be playlists on SFO for the various types
58640	59660	of video.
59660	64140	And if there's any holes in the backlog, it will simply link to the Devonitized version
64140	65400	of that video.
65400	71360	Also, for that re-monetization to happen, I have to keep my watch hours up.
71360	74660	So if you've ever considered re-watching my old videos or checking out some stuff that
74660	79060	you might have missed, the next week or two is probably a good time to do it.
79060	84120	So the plan will be that the monetization comes back on SFO, the edgier videos will
84120	88960	be on a side channel as well as on my bitshoot, and then will continue as normal.
88960	93140	However, if it turns out that monetization just won't come back, and that's actually
93140	98380	very rare, because one of the people that I talked to, he said that he applied and reapplied
98380	101940	and reapplied over the course of six months, and eventually got his monetization back as
101940	106100	he trimmed out more and more of his backlog, hopefully it won't take me six months.
106100	111960	But if for some reason I find out that monetization just isn't coming back, well then I will have
111960	113420	to start a new channel.
113420	118720	SFO will probably become the backlog, and Devonatized will probably become the main
118720	120640	channel where I'll upload new stuff.
120640	123600	However, from what I've heard, I don't think I'm going to have to do that.
123600	126760	There is at least an okay chance that things will turn out fine.
126760	130120	As always, if you want to support, there is a Patreon and a Subscribestar.
130120	134640	There's my affiliate links and Amazon equipment wishlist in the description of the video if
134640	136080	you want to contribute that way.
136080	141040	I still do the daily streams over on Game Boomers, that's twitch.tv slash Game Boomers.
141040	145020	And since I'm a twitch affiliate, I do have monetization there, so you can also donate
145020	147000	through their platform as well.
147000	152380	And I plan to start those daily SFO streams tomorrow with the watching of the final debate
152380	157300	with Lilith and Scrump, Scrump the guy who caused the problems in the first place.
157300	159260	And we'll see who else we can get in there as well.
159260	163860	So yeah, drop by tonight for the finale of Carrion, and drop by tomorrow night for the
163860	164860	debate stream.
164860	166140	I'll see you then.
166140	167140	I love you.
167140	168980	Oh wait, no, there's actually something else.
168980	170340	Check this out, check this out.
170340	173220	So I was in Lore Reloaded's stream.
173220	177000	He's a Star Trek YouTuber, he's not political, and we're friends and stuff.
177000	180320	But I was in there watching his stream, and he showed me this screenshot.
180320	186360	Apparently all of my chats have to be manually approved now, whenever I'm on the SFO account.
186360	191020	And I tried a few other chats on YouTube, and it's the exact same way everywhere else.
191020	195140	It turns out that that is just how it is as long as I'm demonetized.
195140	198620	Because I was demonetized for hate speech, even though it wasn't me actually doing the
198620	200940	hate speech, Scrump.
200940	206620	Until this is solved, this is what my YouTube chatting experience is going to look like.
206620	207620	Thanks guys.
