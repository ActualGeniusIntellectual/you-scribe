00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
I figured I'd give you guys a quick update on what I'm doing today.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:08,400
In the next one to two weeks you're going to see a lot of my backlogged videos disappear

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,320
off of the SFO channel.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,860
I'm doing this based on some advice that I've been given from multiple people who have gone

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,860
through this process before.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:23,860
When YouTube examines your channel for re-monetization, they will often go through your entire backlog.

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:29,980
So I'll be taking down all of the streams that I've done, as well as a few select videos.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,760
That doesn't mean they're going to be gone forever.

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,640
The videos are still up on my bitshoot at bitshoot.com slash shortfatotaku.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:45,000
And if SFO's monetization is restored, those videos will instead be uploaded to the Devonitize

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,220
channel I started a couple weeks ago.

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:53,880
That channel will become basically the backlog for videos that are too edgy to get monetized.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,640
And how I plan to handle it is that there will be playlists on SFO for the various types

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,660
of video.

15
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,140
And if there's any holes in the backlog, it will simply link to the Devonitized version

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,400
of that video.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,360
Also, for that re-monetization to happen, I have to keep my watch hours up.

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,660
So if you've ever considered re-watching my old videos or checking out some stuff that

19
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,060
you might have missed, the next week or two is probably a good time to do it.

20
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,120
So the plan will be that the monetization comes back on SFO, the edgier videos will

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,960
be on a side channel as well as on my bitshoot, and then will continue as normal.

22
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,140
However, if it turns out that monetization just won't come back, and that's actually

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,380
very rare, because one of the people that I talked to, he said that he applied and reapplied

24
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,940
and reapplied over the course of six months, and eventually got his monetization back as

25
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,100
he trimmed out more and more of his backlog, hopefully it won't take me six months.

26
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,960
But if for some reason I find out that monetization just isn't coming back, well then I will have

27
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,420
to start a new channel.

28
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,720
SFO will probably become the backlog, and Devonatized will probably become the main

29
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,640
channel where I'll upload new stuff.

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,600
However, from what I've heard, I don't think I'm going to have to do that.

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,760
There is at least an okay chance that things will turn out fine.

32
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,120
As always, if you want to support, there is a Patreon and a Subscribestar.

33
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,640
There's my affiliate links and Amazon equipment wishlist in the description of the video if

34
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,080
you want to contribute that way.

35
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,040
I still do the daily streams over on Game Boomers, that's twitch.tv slash Game Boomers.

36
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,020
And since I'm a twitch affiliate, I do have monetization there, so you can also donate

37
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,000
through their platform as well.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,380
And I plan to start those daily SFO streams tomorrow with the watching of the final debate

39
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,300
with Lilith and Scrump, Scrump the guy who caused the problems in the first place.

40
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,260
And we'll see who else we can get in there as well.

41
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,860
So yeah, drop by tonight for the finale of Carrion, and drop by tomorrow night for the

42
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,860
debate stream.

43
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,140
I'll see you then.

44
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,140
I love you.

45
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,980
Oh wait, no, there's actually something else.

46
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,340
Check this out, check this out.

47
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,220
So I was in Lore Reloaded's stream.

48
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,000
He's a Star Trek YouTuber, he's not political, and we're friends and stuff.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,320
But I was in there watching his stream, and he showed me this screenshot.

50
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:06,360
Apparently all of my chats have to be manually approved now, whenever I'm on the SFO account.

51
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,020
And I tried a few other chats on YouTube, and it's the exact same way everywhere else.

52
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,140
It turns out that that is just how it is as long as I'm demonetized.

53
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,620
Because I was demonetized for hate speech, even though it wasn't me actually doing the

54
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,940
hate speech, Scrump.

55
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,620
Until this is solved, this is what my YouTube chatting experience is going to look like.

56
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,620
Thanks guys.
