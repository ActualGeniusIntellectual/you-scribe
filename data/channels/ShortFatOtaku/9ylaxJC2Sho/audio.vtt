00:00.000 --> 00:10.300
Have you ever heard of the concept of safe horny? It's a relatively new term, first

00:10.300 --> 00:16.540
used on Twitter on April 3rd, 2023. Overwatch 2's newest support hero at the time, Life

00:16.540 --> 00:20.820
Weaver, was just announced. Polygon wrote this article about the character.

00:20.820 --> 00:25.920
Overwatch 2's next support hero has been revealed and confirmed to be hot. The attached

00:25.920 --> 00:31.920
image shows a brown-skinned man with fabulous hair and an open robe revealing his chiseled

00:31.920 --> 00:38.260
chest. This guy is entirely cut from the cloth of 90s anime bishounen characters.

00:38.260 --> 00:44.420
Joe Longballs on Twitter replied to the article saying, they got a safe horny hero out and

00:44.420 --> 00:48.860
poly to talk about him. They must have ran over an employee in the parking lot this time.

00:48.860 --> 00:53.260
The joke is, every time Blizzard gets into a bit of legal trouble or a new story comes

00:53.260 --> 00:57.480
out of the company about sexual harassment or bullying, they respond by announcing a

00:57.480 --> 01:03.120
new gay or trans or non-binary or whatever the fuck character in Overwatch. Or they announce

01:03.120 --> 01:07.920
that an old character has also been secretly gay or trans or non-binary this whole time.

01:07.920 --> 01:13.180
Of course, Polygon and other games journalist outlets have no shortage of articles condemning

01:13.180 --> 01:19.660
straight men or gamers or really anybody who's not protected by progressivism as being objectifying.

01:19.660 --> 01:23.880
The male gaze is an oppressive force hovering over gaming. And if you like characters with

01:23.880 --> 01:28.420
fat tits or something, you're a misogynist. Which is why it's so strange that they focus

01:28.420 --> 01:34.120
on life weavers attractiveness. Is this also not objectifying? Is this not also the female

01:34.120 --> 01:39.640
gaze or the gay man's gaze or whatever? That's why it's called safe horny. This is a type

01:39.640 --> 01:44.520
of attraction you're allowed to show in public, unashamedly, by progressive standards. Your

01:44.520 --> 01:48.920
sexuality is bad and oppressive. Their sexuality is good and empowering.

01:48.920 --> 01:52.640
The interesting thing about language and human cognition is that as soon as somebody

01:52.640 --> 01:57.700
coins a phrase for a phenomenon that intuitively makes sense, immediately other concepts and

01:57.700 --> 02:02.760
examples start to come into focus. It was always kind of strange that, back when Resident

02:02.760 --> 02:08.380
Evil Village launched in 2021, leftoids were publicly drooling over the eight-foot-tall

02:08.380 --> 02:16.440
dommy mommy that is Lady Demisgryu. Isn't this sexually objectifying a female character?

02:16.440 --> 02:22.080
But now it makes sense. It's safe horny. Same thing with the reaction to Ganondorf's muscle-bound

02:22.080 --> 02:26.960
samurai redesign in The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, or the reaction to Ryu's beard

02:26.960 --> 02:31.640
in Street Fighter 6. Now that we have a term for this behavior, safe horny, it becomes

02:31.640 --> 02:36.940
a lot easier to understand. And seeing how safe horny works with trans characters actually

02:36.940 --> 02:40.800
reveals some additional information. In my previous video, the one about how Link from

02:40.800 --> 02:46.000
Legend of Zelda is often reimagined as gay or trans by progressive fans who demand representation

02:46.000 --> 02:49.440
in a series and from a company that doesn't really care about that concept. I made the

02:49.440 --> 02:55.020
point that a lot of arguments used to declare characters as gay or trans appeals to stereotypes

02:55.020 --> 03:00.120
that if they were invoked by anybody other than progressives would be considered bigoted.

03:00.120 --> 03:04.280
An old stereotype about trans people is that trans women and male crossdressers are the

03:04.280 --> 03:08.160
same thing. They're not because trans women experience gender dysphoria, which is a mental

03:08.160 --> 03:11.760
illness with symptoms and legitimate suffering. The best treatment for which we've discovered

03:11.760 --> 03:16.160
so far is the transition. Meanwhile, crossdressers are people who have a fetish for dressing

03:16.160 --> 03:20.240
up in the other gender's clothing. It gets them off to dress up in clothes that specifically

03:20.240 --> 03:24.880
are not suited for them, that it is taboo for them to wear. An old stereotype about

03:24.880 --> 03:30.420
trans women is that they're both crossdressers and gay men. But not all gay men actually

03:30.420 --> 03:34.680
crossdress. And as far as I know, simply being attracted to the same sex doesn't come with

03:34.680 --> 03:35.680
dysphoria.

03:35.680 --> 03:40.640
So by the progressive standard, conflating crossdressers with trans women is transphobic.

03:40.640 --> 03:45.640
And yet, when Link in Breath of the Wild or Cloud in Final Fantasy VII dress as women

03:45.640 --> 03:50.880
in order to infiltrate female-only spaces, the all-women city of the Gerudo and Don Corneo's

03:50.880 --> 03:55.180
brothel respectively, this is considered evidence by progressive fans that those characters

03:55.180 --> 04:00.140
are actually trans. They're not even crossdressing as a fetish, they're doing it out of necessity.

04:00.140 --> 04:03.720
This essentially shows the nature of these one-sided rules. If a progressive looks at

04:03.720 --> 04:08.660
a crossdressing male and declares them trans, that's empowering and positive representation.

04:08.660 --> 04:11.980
If anybody else looks at a crossdressing male and declares them trans, that's bigoted

04:11.980 --> 04:13.400
and transphobic.

04:13.400 --> 04:18.040
One of the rules of safe horny seems to be that if your politics are correct, then the

04:18.040 --> 04:23.980
use of normally offensive stereotypes in the creation of safe horny is actually okay. According

04:23.980 --> 04:27.740
to the progressive lens, it's not bigoted if the right person with the right beliefs

04:27.740 --> 04:31.260
does the same damn thing that any bigot would do.

04:31.260 --> 04:35.500
Being the old man that I am, I remember the progressive reaction to Dragon's Crown, a

04:35.500 --> 04:40.940
2013 PlayStation 3 game. The sorceress class in that game is a big boobed anime woman,

04:40.940 --> 04:44.900
and game journalists of the time collectively lost their fucking minds over it. The thing

04:44.900 --> 04:48.620
is though, this is actually the art style of Dragon's Crown. The other characters

04:48.620 --> 04:53.900
are also hyper-exaggerated. The elf is a loli with giga-thick thighs, the fighter has about

04:53.900 --> 04:59.020
80% of his body mass in his chest and shoulders, and the dwarf is just a fucking brick. The

04:59.020 --> 05:04.620
only halfway normal-looking character is the wizard, who still has some weirdly long limbs.

05:04.620 --> 05:09.740
In general, the art of Dragon's Crown is specifically meant to be grotesque caricatures,

05:09.740 --> 05:14.220
but 2013's progressives focused mainly on the sorceress because of her tits, and a little

05:14.220 --> 05:18.440
on Amazon because of her ass. Compare that to the progressive response to objectified

05:18.440 --> 05:22.660
or objectifiable female characters today. What changed? Is it that progressives have

05:22.660 --> 05:27.260
themselves become less puritanical? Maybe, but I don't think so. Is it because, now

05:27.260 --> 05:31.180
that there's more progressives in the gaming space, now that the space has the correct

05:31.180 --> 05:36.420
politics, they're free to objectify because their desires are good and yours are bad?

05:36.420 --> 05:40.340
Bingo. Now, some people online believe that the safe horny phenomenon isn't necessarily

05:40.340 --> 05:43.660
related to politics, but more to the idea that characters that are less traditionally

05:43.660 --> 05:47.780
sexualized are actually more sexualizable. Lady Dommy Mommy from before doesn't wear

05:47.780 --> 05:52.180
traditionally sexy clothing, so she can be made more sexual by progressives. But characters

05:52.180 --> 05:56.940
that are more overtly sexual themselves, like sorceress, they're objectifying. This also

05:56.940 --> 06:02.140
explains Link in Cloud's crossdressing reaction too. But I'm not entirely sure this explanation

06:02.140 --> 06:06.220
is accurate. I mean, it's probably partially accurate, but I also think that you cannot

06:06.220 --> 06:11.400
ignore the political variable, where the same sexualization is empowering by progs and objectifying

06:11.400 --> 06:16.180
by non-progs. And there's two reasons why I think you can't ignore the politics. Firstly,

06:16.180 --> 06:19.860
it's very easy to just take a quick look at the types of accounts that do this sort of

06:19.860 --> 06:25.420
canceling. My friend V got in trouble for this tweet recently. I am willing to pay $90

06:25.420 --> 06:29.820
for this. Why won't you take my cash Western Corporation? Sorry, I can't do a Romanian

06:29.820 --> 06:34.500
accent. The left picture is of the ugly fable girl and the right picture is what gamers

06:34.500 --> 06:40.000
apparently actually want. Progressives immediately brigaded V for desiring sexualized attractive

06:40.000 --> 06:44.080
women in video games, saying that gamers are still misogynists or that porn has rotted

06:44.080 --> 06:48.780
their brains or whatever. And yet, checking out the likes tab of all of these accounts

06:48.780 --> 06:53.440
shows that each and every single one of them has no problem with lewd content. Just like

06:53.440 --> 06:58.300
how Republican politicians commonly have secret stashes of gay or trans porn, puritanical

06:58.300 --> 07:02.800
progressives who love to police the male gays have no problem beating the meat to their

07:02.800 --> 07:07.840
selection of safe horny content. Modern progs claim to be the most sexually permissible

07:07.840 --> 07:12.280
group humanity's ever seen, and yet they still demand that anything sexual that they

07:12.280 --> 07:16.660
specifically don't approve of is censored. The second reason has to do with a concept

07:16.660 --> 07:21.520
related to safe horny, called safe edgy. In fact, it seems accurate to consider safe horny

07:21.520 --> 07:25.580
to be a subset of safe edgy. You ever see those jokes about the British or the French,

07:25.580 --> 07:29.740
or more broadly white people in general, that if they were made about some non-European

07:29.740 --> 07:34.920
ethnicity would be considered totally unacceptable? That is safe edgy. It sounds like you're

07:34.920 --> 07:37.960
saying something edgy, like you're really sticking your neck out there with this hot

07:37.960 --> 07:42.360
take, but it's actually the easiest fucking thing you can say and you have no risk of

07:42.360 --> 07:47.200
actually receiving any blowback from it. The safe edgy starter pack went viral in 2022

07:47.200 --> 07:51.480
and it pretty much has the whole thing wrapped up into one neat package. Safe edgy people

07:51.480 --> 07:56.260
are overwhelmingly leftists who still believe that they are the cultural underdog. Despite

07:56.260 --> 08:01.040
the fact that corporations parrot their positions, organizations promote their ideas, major talking

08:01.040 --> 08:05.180
heads show open support for their movements, and disagreeing with their politics in public

08:05.180 --> 08:07.040
is a cancelable offense.

08:07.040 --> 08:13.120
Probably the most telling example of safe edgy is Satanism in 2023. Satanism, the modern

08:13.120 --> 08:18.120
day satanic temple thing, came about primarily as a way for punks to fuck with pearl-clutching

08:18.120 --> 08:22.120
Christians fifty years ago, and that's a job it did pretty well. It was actually edgy

08:22.120 --> 08:28.220
back then. But now? Do people still genuinely believe the satanic temple is edgy in 2023?

08:28.220 --> 08:29.760
Check this cringe shit out.

08:29.760 --> 08:33.900
I had a blast at the satanic temple today. Blessed be, inhale thyself. I did not know

08:33.900 --> 08:37.760
they let you snuggle up to Baphomet for selfies. Yep, when you go up to the front door and

08:37.760 --> 08:41.160
wait for someone to come out to check your vaccination card and give you masks, then

08:41.160 --> 08:45.280
he lets you in and goes over the rules. Sitting on Baphomet is allowed and even encouraged.

08:45.280 --> 08:49.680
Oh wow, you're really pushing the fucking boundaries here. If you wanted to really be

08:49.680 --> 08:54.560
edgy, maybe you should try to actually remove the mask and see what happens. To truly be

08:54.560 --> 09:00.280
edgy, to actually be the underdog, means that society by and large has to reject your ideas

09:00.280 --> 09:05.680
and exclude you from participation in it for holding those ideas. For example, during COVID,

09:05.680 --> 09:09.800
being edgy meant not wearing a mask and not getting vaccinated.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.940
Now I'm not saying whether that's right or wrong. I'm saying that going against the

09:12.940 --> 09:18.640
grain means that you specifically do not do what the majority of people around you do.

09:18.640 --> 09:23.760
You don't listen to the advice of normative institutions demanding that you must do something.

09:23.760 --> 09:29.200
Being edgy doesn't mean being compliant. When there's a pride flag on every street corner,

09:29.200 --> 09:34.660
gay people aren't edgy anymore. They're normal. And that's why you see Gen Z teens sometimes

09:34.660 --> 09:39.200
rebel against pride stuff in schools. Not because they've been groomed to be Nazis,

09:39.200 --> 09:43.000
whatever dumbfuck nonsense the progs say, but because teens are naturally rebellious

09:43.000 --> 09:47.200
against the order that adults have set up, as a part of their exploratory phase of their

09:47.200 --> 09:52.960
development. If the world around them is pro-queer, then they will be anti-queer, at least superficially,

09:52.960 --> 09:57.160
simply to experience what it's like. And, of course, whenever you confront people who

09:57.160 --> 10:03.160
are safe edgy about their larping, they immediately transform into snowflakes. You can find progs

10:03.160 --> 10:08.280
all over the place saying that cis white males, they're so fragile, they're angry about everything,

10:08.280 --> 10:12.680
white male rage, but the minute that you drop an n-bomb, they collapse into a screeching

10:12.680 --> 10:17.760
pile of blubber. They cannot actually tolerate the existence of truly edgy stuff because

10:17.760 --> 10:22.660
it puts on display how safe their positions actually are. They want the clout of being

10:22.660 --> 10:27.520
the counterculture without actually being on the outside because they are the institutions,

10:27.520 --> 10:31.340
they are the source of normative principles now. This is partially what I was getting

10:31.340 --> 10:36.040
at when I made my conservatism is the counterculture video years ago, which funnily enough was

10:36.040 --> 10:40.500
Vosch's first exposure to my content. Like the brainlet he is, he believes that I was

10:40.500 --> 10:45.260
actually saying conservatism is punk rock because that was the gateway metaphor I used.

10:45.260 --> 10:49.440
And I still occasionally hear screams from his fanbase about it. Good times. There's

10:49.440 --> 10:54.040
a lot of different intersecting principles here. The idea of trolls remorse, that a lot

10:54.040 --> 10:58.660
of the people who are now safe edgy or safe horny also used to be actually edgy. And by

10:58.660 --> 11:03.320
actually edgy, I mean they used to watch iDubbbz videos in what they now call their alt-right

11:03.320 --> 11:07.580
pipeline phase, something they feel like they have to be publicly remorseful for. There's

11:07.580 --> 11:11.700
also the nature of power, what is gained by claiming something as the normative position

11:11.700 --> 11:15.860
around which other modes of thought deviate from, while also understanding that the outsider

11:15.860 --> 11:19.900
position from that normative center brings with it its own benefits. There's also the

11:19.900 --> 11:25.160
idea of freedom itself. What does it mean to be free in the face of the concept of safety?

11:25.160 --> 11:28.560
Being safe brings with it a degree of freedom since you don't need to worry about outside

11:28.560 --> 11:33.380
interference as much. But the mechanisms that secure that safety can also stifle freedom.

11:33.380 --> 11:38.600
If you're free from safety, is that liberating or endangering? Is it both? Each of these

11:38.600 --> 11:42.380
ideas are deserving of their own video, so I'll be doing them as follow-ups. But insofar

11:42.380 --> 11:45.780
as this conversation goes, the main reason this video isn't an indefensible, despite

11:45.780 --> 11:49.580
a huge chunk of the safe horny stuff revolving around video games, is because progressives

11:49.580 --> 11:54.220
also do this to real-life people. Here's Elon Musk liking a post by the red-headed

11:54.220 --> 11:58.960
libertarian who is an attractive young woman. The post is a meme about Elliot Page replacing

11:58.960 --> 12:04.960
the Protect Trans Kids shirt with Sterilize Autistic Kids. Hassan replied to this by saying

12:04.960 --> 12:09.880
Elon is autistic and he has a trans kid, but he's such a horny reply guy that he forgot.

12:09.880 --> 12:13.980
Hold on a minute, we're living in the progressive sex-positive empowering future, right? What

12:13.980 --> 12:18.840
is exactly wrong with being a horny reply guy? Every single bread-tuber and progressive

12:18.840 --> 12:23.680
on the fucking platform posts ooh-woo, I am respectfully looking, with sweating emojis

12:23.680 --> 12:28.940
underneath every single 5 out of 10 OnlyFans art hoe, while Hassan himself has flown to

12:28.940 --> 12:34.140
Europe to fuck sex slaves held in a brothel. This is fundamentally why I don't think it's

12:34.140 --> 12:40.300
about the left becoming less puritanical over time, but it is at its core a political conversation.

12:40.300 --> 12:46.060
To the progs, leftist sexuality good, non-leftist sexuality bad, simple as. They make fun of

12:46.060 --> 12:51.120
tradwives and monogamy and people who want that lifestyle or engage with those communities

12:51.120 --> 12:55.700
because it's not a form of sexuality that they politically approve of. This whole discussion

12:55.700 --> 13:00.700
is an outgrowth of the choice feminism stuff from the 2010s. Choice feminism posited that

13:00.700 --> 13:05.300
the feminist project is fulfilled if women have the choice to do what they want. If individual

13:05.300 --> 13:09.620
women choose to be tradwives and homemakers instead of being sexually promiscuous because

13:09.620 --> 13:14.540
they actually want that, then it's still a feminist act because it's the agency of

13:14.540 --> 13:19.920
women that ultimately matters. Radical feminism rejects this idea because, in their view,

13:19.920 --> 13:24.500
it does nothing to actually liberate women as a class, to the point that individual women

13:24.500 --> 13:29.240
who choose more traditional lifestyles are traitors to feminism. This is the everything

13:29.240 --> 13:33.940
is political, even your personal choices view that my Gramsci video went into detail about.

13:33.940 --> 13:38.620
If you're a true revolutionary, then you have an obligation to make revolutionary choices

13:38.620 --> 13:43.220
even if that's not what you personally want. And every time a choice feminist promotes

13:43.220 --> 13:47.700
a more traditional lifestyle, they set the feminist movement back because other women

13:47.700 --> 13:53.160
might be influenced by their happiness and fulfilled life to also abandon being a revolutionary.

13:53.160 --> 13:58.440
Unsurprisingly, by 2023, in the face of the left's ongoing radicalization, choice feminism

13:58.440 --> 14:03.200
is pretty much nonexistent among progressives due to it being too liberal, too individualistic,

14:03.200 --> 14:07.400
and too bourgeois. The radfem critique of it is that because it doesn't institutionally

14:07.400 --> 14:11.600
challenge the status quo, because it carves out a private domain where politics don't

14:11.600 --> 14:15.200
apply, because it gives women the choice to not be a revolutionary if that's in their

14:15.200 --> 14:19.100
heart, it is ultimately reactionary. In any case, it's at the bottom of all of this

14:19.100 --> 14:24.220
is that human sexuality is fun, and being edgy is fun too. Everybody enjoys feeling

14:24.220 --> 14:28.300
like they've left the safe, known bounds of what their culture considers acceptable,

14:28.300 --> 14:31.580
and they're now out in the wilderness, in the uncharted lands. Everybody knows what

14:31.580 --> 14:35.900
it feels like when the call of exploration and adventure beckons, even only if in terms

14:35.900 --> 14:40.460
of thoughts or speech. Everyone knows the thrill of doing or saying or even thinking

14:40.460 --> 14:44.820
something considered taboo, but the moral foundations of the progressive are overwhelmingly

14:44.820 --> 14:49.200
preoccupied with safety, to the point that they seek to kill any sort of true exploratory

14:49.200 --> 14:53.120
impulse, care harm over everything else in heights terms. On the internet, it's pretty

14:53.120 --> 14:56.560
easy to keep up the safety larp, where progressives pretend that they're on the edge when they're

14:56.560 --> 15:00.920
actually not. At least it was for a while. But like with the Hassan example earlier,

15:00.920 --> 15:06.460
it all falls apart once you look at what people actually do in real life. Right now, progressive

15:06.460 --> 15:12.600
logic dictates that sex is simultaneously so safe and so fun and ultimately so inconsequential

15:12.600 --> 15:16.620
that you can have it with anyone you like, any time you like, and any restriction on

15:16.620 --> 15:20.820
any sexuality whatsoever is oppressive, to the point that twerking in front of kids at

15:20.820 --> 15:25.540
pride parades is just harmless fun and hurts no one, while at the exact same time, sex

15:25.540 --> 15:30.860
is so dangerous and so potentially damaging that you need constant reaffirmation of consent

15:30.860 --> 15:35.340
signed across multiple forms and filed away with the campus security office before you

15:35.340 --> 15:40.380
even ask a girl out because the slightest wrong move is so traumatizing to your partner

15:40.380 --> 15:44.520
that you're a rapist and should absolutely be fired and cancelled and drummed out of

15:44.520 --> 15:49.440
polite society. These two ideas just don't fit together. A guy shooting his shot, getting

15:49.440 --> 15:53.960
rejected, and then leaving the girl alone means that that girl was traumatized or microaggressed

15:53.960 --> 15:59.280
or stare raped or whatever the fuck is a sexual moral code that does not allow for free love

15:59.280 --> 16:04.680
and open, consequence-free sexuality. Unless the progressive goal isn't actually sexual

16:04.680 --> 16:09.720
liberation. It is to use sexuality as a method by which they control their political enemies.

16:09.720 --> 16:14.500
Which by the way, is what a lot of ruling classes have done across human history. That

16:14.500 --> 16:19.280
is what safe horny really means. They're allowed to simp and drool under every Only

16:19.280 --> 16:23.860
Fan's Thoughts page because they vote for pro sex work policies. But if you do it, you're

16:23.860 --> 16:28.580
a male gazing misogynist. They can create sexual content for others to enjoy because

16:28.580 --> 16:32.840
the big boobs that they draw are empowering women with that body type. But if you do it,

16:32.840 --> 16:36.960
you're oppressing those women through objectification and playing into stereotypes. They can fuck

16:36.960 --> 16:40.920
prostitutes because they've read theory about the political dynamics of prostitution.

16:40.920 --> 16:45.380
But if you do it, you're an enabler of sex trafficking. Safe horny simply describes the

16:45.380 --> 16:50.300
moral license to be sexual in the midst of progressive puritanism. Safe edgy fundamentally

16:50.300 --> 16:54.280
works the same way. They spend so much time inventing slurs for white people and they're

16:54.280 --> 16:58.980
all like water rolling off a duck's back. But one slur for black people and they instantly

16:58.980 --> 17:03.660
lose their minds. And by the way, that is how you combat all of this. If they complain

17:03.660 --> 17:07.940
that your sexuality is objectifying, just say, yes, it is. Yes, I will objectify. Yes,

17:07.940 --> 17:11.500
I will trigger you with slurs. Fuck them. If they're going to play this one sided

17:11.500 --> 17:15.420
game, I'm more than willing to force it to be equal. Crying to them about how it's

17:15.420 --> 17:19.320
not fair is simply accepting that you're fighting with one hand tied behind your back.

17:19.320 --> 17:23.420
So it's far better to simply say to them, yes, I'm going to do everything you do.

17:23.420 --> 17:27.860
And no, I don't care if you approve of it or not. I don't need to take your moral

17:27.860 --> 17:30.740
judgment into consideration because you are immoral.
