0	10300	Have you ever heard of the concept of safe horny? It's a relatively new term, first
10300	16540	used on Twitter on April 3rd, 2023. Overwatch 2's newest support hero at the time, Life
16540	20820	Weaver, was just announced. Polygon wrote this article about the character.
20820	25920	Overwatch 2's next support hero has been revealed and confirmed to be hot. The attached
25920	31920	image shows a brown-skinned man with fabulous hair and an open robe revealing his chiseled
31920	38260	chest. This guy is entirely cut from the cloth of 90s anime bishounen characters.
38260	44420	Joe Longballs on Twitter replied to the article saying, they got a safe horny hero out and
44420	48860	poly to talk about him. They must have ran over an employee in the parking lot this time.
48860	53260	The joke is, every time Blizzard gets into a bit of legal trouble or a new story comes
53260	57480	out of the company about sexual harassment or bullying, they respond by announcing a
57480	63120	new gay or trans or non-binary or whatever the fuck character in Overwatch. Or they announce
63120	67920	that an old character has also been secretly gay or trans or non-binary this whole time.
67920	73180	Of course, Polygon and other games journalist outlets have no shortage of articles condemning
73180	79660	straight men or gamers or really anybody who's not protected by progressivism as being objectifying.
79660	83880	The male gaze is an oppressive force hovering over gaming. And if you like characters with
83880	88420	fat tits or something, you're a misogynist. Which is why it's so strange that they focus
88420	94120	on life weavers attractiveness. Is this also not objectifying? Is this not also the female
94120	99640	gaze or the gay man's gaze or whatever? That's why it's called safe horny. This is a type
99640	104520	of attraction you're allowed to show in public, unashamedly, by progressive standards. Your
104520	108920	sexuality is bad and oppressive. Their sexuality is good and empowering.
108920	112640	The interesting thing about language and human cognition is that as soon as somebody
112640	117700	coins a phrase for a phenomenon that intuitively makes sense, immediately other concepts and
117700	122760	examples start to come into focus. It was always kind of strange that, back when Resident
122760	128380	Evil Village launched in 2021, leftoids were publicly drooling over the eight-foot-tall
128380	136440	dommy mommy that is Lady Demisgryu. Isn't this sexually objectifying a female character?
136440	142080	But now it makes sense. It's safe horny. Same thing with the reaction to Ganondorf's muscle-bound
142080	146960	samurai redesign in The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, or the reaction to Ryu's beard
146960	151640	in Street Fighter 6. Now that we have a term for this behavior, safe horny, it becomes
151640	156940	a lot easier to understand. And seeing how safe horny works with trans characters actually
156940	160800	reveals some additional information. In my previous video, the one about how Link from
160800	166000	Legend of Zelda is often reimagined as gay or trans by progressive fans who demand representation
166000	169440	in a series and from a company that doesn't really care about that concept. I made the
169440	175020	point that a lot of arguments used to declare characters as gay or trans appeals to stereotypes
175020	180120	that if they were invoked by anybody other than progressives would be considered bigoted.
180120	184280	An old stereotype about trans people is that trans women and male crossdressers are the
184280	188160	same thing. They're not because trans women experience gender dysphoria, which is a mental
188160	191760	illness with symptoms and legitimate suffering. The best treatment for which we've discovered
191760	196160	so far is the transition. Meanwhile, crossdressers are people who have a fetish for dressing
196160	200240	up in the other gender's clothing. It gets them off to dress up in clothes that specifically
200240	204880	are not suited for them, that it is taboo for them to wear. An old stereotype about
204880	210420	trans women is that they're both crossdressers and gay men. But not all gay men actually
210420	214680	crossdress. And as far as I know, simply being attracted to the same sex doesn't come with
214680	215680	dysphoria.
215680	220640	So by the progressive standard, conflating crossdressers with trans women is transphobic.
220640	225640	And yet, when Link in Breath of the Wild or Cloud in Final Fantasy VII dress as women
225640	230880	in order to infiltrate female-only spaces, the all-women city of the Gerudo and Don Corneo's
230880	235180	brothel respectively, this is considered evidence by progressive fans that those characters
235180	240140	are actually trans. They're not even crossdressing as a fetish, they're doing it out of necessity.
240140	243720	This essentially shows the nature of these one-sided rules. If a progressive looks at
243720	248660	a crossdressing male and declares them trans, that's empowering and positive representation.
248660	251980	If anybody else looks at a crossdressing male and declares them trans, that's bigoted
251980	253400	and transphobic.
253400	258040	One of the rules of safe horny seems to be that if your politics are correct, then the
258040	263980	use of normally offensive stereotypes in the creation of safe horny is actually okay. According
263980	267740	to the progressive lens, it's not bigoted if the right person with the right beliefs
267740	271260	does the same damn thing that any bigot would do.
271260	275500	Being the old man that I am, I remember the progressive reaction to Dragon's Crown, a
275500	280940	2013 PlayStation 3 game. The sorceress class in that game is a big boobed anime woman,
280940	284900	and game journalists of the time collectively lost their fucking minds over it. The thing
284900	288620	is though, this is actually the art style of Dragon's Crown. The other characters
288620	293900	are also hyper-exaggerated. The elf is a loli with giga-thick thighs, the fighter has about
293900	299020	80% of his body mass in his chest and shoulders, and the dwarf is just a fucking brick. The
299020	304620	only halfway normal-looking character is the wizard, who still has some weirdly long limbs.
304620	309740	In general, the art of Dragon's Crown is specifically meant to be grotesque caricatures,
309740	314220	but 2013's progressives focused mainly on the sorceress because of her tits, and a little
314220	318440	on Amazon because of her ass. Compare that to the progressive response to objectified
318440	322660	or objectifiable female characters today. What changed? Is it that progressives have
322660	327260	themselves become less puritanical? Maybe, but I don't think so. Is it because, now
327260	331180	that there's more progressives in the gaming space, now that the space has the correct
331180	336420	politics, they're free to objectify because their desires are good and yours are bad?
336420	340340	Bingo. Now, some people online believe that the safe horny phenomenon isn't necessarily
340340	343660	related to politics, but more to the idea that characters that are less traditionally
343660	347780	sexualized are actually more sexualizable. Lady Dommy Mommy from before doesn't wear
347780	352180	traditionally sexy clothing, so she can be made more sexual by progressives. But characters
352180	356940	that are more overtly sexual themselves, like sorceress, they're objectifying. This also
356940	362140	explains Link in Cloud's crossdressing reaction too. But I'm not entirely sure this explanation
362140	366220	is accurate. I mean, it's probably partially accurate, but I also think that you cannot
366220	371400	ignore the political variable, where the same sexualization is empowering by progs and objectifying
371400	376180	by non-progs. And there's two reasons why I think you can't ignore the politics. Firstly,
376180	379860	it's very easy to just take a quick look at the types of accounts that do this sort of
379860	385420	canceling. My friend V got in trouble for this tweet recently. I am willing to pay $90
385420	389820	for this. Why won't you take my cash Western Corporation? Sorry, I can't do a Romanian
389820	394500	accent. The left picture is of the ugly fable girl and the right picture is what gamers
394500	400000	apparently actually want. Progressives immediately brigaded V for desiring sexualized attractive
400000	404080	women in video games, saying that gamers are still misogynists or that porn has rotted
404080	408780	their brains or whatever. And yet, checking out the likes tab of all of these accounts
408780	413440	shows that each and every single one of them has no problem with lewd content. Just like
413440	418300	how Republican politicians commonly have secret stashes of gay or trans porn, puritanical
418300	422800	progressives who love to police the male gays have no problem beating the meat to their
422800	427840	selection of safe horny content. Modern progs claim to be the most sexually permissible
427840	432280	group humanity's ever seen, and yet they still demand that anything sexual that they
432280	436660	specifically don't approve of is censored. The second reason has to do with a concept
436660	441520	related to safe horny, called safe edgy. In fact, it seems accurate to consider safe horny
441520	445580	to be a subset of safe edgy. You ever see those jokes about the British or the French,
445580	449740	or more broadly white people in general, that if they were made about some non-European
449740	454920	ethnicity would be considered totally unacceptable? That is safe edgy. It sounds like you're
454920	457960	saying something edgy, like you're really sticking your neck out there with this hot
457960	462360	take, but it's actually the easiest fucking thing you can say and you have no risk of
462360	467200	actually receiving any blowback from it. The safe edgy starter pack went viral in 2022
467200	471480	and it pretty much has the whole thing wrapped up into one neat package. Safe edgy people
471480	476260	are overwhelmingly leftists who still believe that they are the cultural underdog. Despite
476260	481040	the fact that corporations parrot their positions, organizations promote their ideas, major talking
481040	485180	heads show open support for their movements, and disagreeing with their politics in public
485180	487040	is a cancelable offense.
487040	493120	Probably the most telling example of safe edgy is Satanism in 2023. Satanism, the modern
493120	498120	day satanic temple thing, came about primarily as a way for punks to fuck with pearl-clutching
498120	502120	Christians fifty years ago, and that's a job it did pretty well. It was actually edgy
502120	508220	back then. But now? Do people still genuinely believe the satanic temple is edgy in 2023?
508220	509760	Check this cringe shit out.
509760	513900	I had a blast at the satanic temple today. Blessed be, inhale thyself. I did not know
513900	517760	they let you snuggle up to Baphomet for selfies. Yep, when you go up to the front door and
517760	521160	wait for someone to come out to check your vaccination card and give you masks, then
521160	525280	he lets you in and goes over the rules. Sitting on Baphomet is allowed and even encouraged.
525280	529680	Oh wow, you're really pushing the fucking boundaries here. If you wanted to really be
529680	534560	edgy, maybe you should try to actually remove the mask and see what happens. To truly be
534560	540280	edgy, to actually be the underdog, means that society by and large has to reject your ideas
540280	545680	and exclude you from participation in it for holding those ideas. For example, during COVID,
545680	549800	being edgy meant not wearing a mask and not getting vaccinated.
549800	552940	Now I'm not saying whether that's right or wrong. I'm saying that going against the
552940	558640	grain means that you specifically do not do what the majority of people around you do.
558640	563760	You don't listen to the advice of normative institutions demanding that you must do something.
563760	569200	Being edgy doesn't mean being compliant. When there's a pride flag on every street corner,
569200	574660	gay people aren't edgy anymore. They're normal. And that's why you see Gen Z teens sometimes
574660	579200	rebel against pride stuff in schools. Not because they've been groomed to be Nazis,
579200	583000	whatever dumbfuck nonsense the progs say, but because teens are naturally rebellious
583000	587200	against the order that adults have set up, as a part of their exploratory phase of their
587200	592960	development. If the world around them is pro-queer, then they will be anti-queer, at least superficially,
592960	597160	simply to experience what it's like. And, of course, whenever you confront people who
597160	603160	are safe edgy about their larping, they immediately transform into snowflakes. You can find progs
603160	608280	all over the place saying that cis white males, they're so fragile, they're angry about everything,
608280	612680	white male rage, but the minute that you drop an n-bomb, they collapse into a screeching
612680	617760	pile of blubber. They cannot actually tolerate the existence of truly edgy stuff because
617760	622660	it puts on display how safe their positions actually are. They want the clout of being
622660	627520	the counterculture without actually being on the outside because they are the institutions,
627520	631340	they are the source of normative principles now. This is partially what I was getting
631340	636040	at when I made my conservatism is the counterculture video years ago, which funnily enough was
636040	640500	Vosch's first exposure to my content. Like the brainlet he is, he believes that I was
640500	645260	actually saying conservatism is punk rock because that was the gateway metaphor I used.
645260	649440	And I still occasionally hear screams from his fanbase about it. Good times. There's
649440	654040	a lot of different intersecting principles here. The idea of trolls remorse, that a lot
654040	658660	of the people who are now safe edgy or safe horny also used to be actually edgy. And by
658660	663320	actually edgy, I mean they used to watch iDubbbz videos in what they now call their alt-right
663320	667580	pipeline phase, something they feel like they have to be publicly remorseful for. There's
667580	671700	also the nature of power, what is gained by claiming something as the normative position
671700	675860	around which other modes of thought deviate from, while also understanding that the outsider
675860	679900	position from that normative center brings with it its own benefits. There's also the
679900	685160	idea of freedom itself. What does it mean to be free in the face of the concept of safety?
685160	688560	Being safe brings with it a degree of freedom since you don't need to worry about outside
688560	693380	interference as much. But the mechanisms that secure that safety can also stifle freedom.
693380	698600	If you're free from safety, is that liberating or endangering? Is it both? Each of these
698600	702380	ideas are deserving of their own video, so I'll be doing them as follow-ups. But insofar
702380	705780	as this conversation goes, the main reason this video isn't an indefensible, despite
705780	709580	a huge chunk of the safe horny stuff revolving around video games, is because progressives
709580	714220	also do this to real-life people. Here's Elon Musk liking a post by the red-headed
714220	718960	libertarian who is an attractive young woman. The post is a meme about Elliot Page replacing
718960	724960	the Protect Trans Kids shirt with Sterilize Autistic Kids. Hassan replied to this by saying
724960	729880	Elon is autistic and he has a trans kid, but he's such a horny reply guy that he forgot.
729880	733980	Hold on a minute, we're living in the progressive sex-positive empowering future, right? What
733980	738840	is exactly wrong with being a horny reply guy? Every single bread-tuber and progressive
738840	743680	on the fucking platform posts ooh-woo, I am respectfully looking, with sweating emojis
743680	748940	underneath every single 5 out of 10 OnlyFans art hoe, while Hassan himself has flown to
748940	754140	Europe to fuck sex slaves held in a brothel. This is fundamentally why I don't think it's
754140	760300	about the left becoming less puritanical over time, but it is at its core a political conversation.
760300	766060	To the progs, leftist sexuality good, non-leftist sexuality bad, simple as. They make fun of
766060	771120	tradwives and monogamy and people who want that lifestyle or engage with those communities
771120	775700	because it's not a form of sexuality that they politically approve of. This whole discussion
775700	780700	is an outgrowth of the choice feminism stuff from the 2010s. Choice feminism posited that
780700	785300	the feminist project is fulfilled if women have the choice to do what they want. If individual
785300	789620	women choose to be tradwives and homemakers instead of being sexually promiscuous because
789620	794540	they actually want that, then it's still a feminist act because it's the agency of
794540	799920	women that ultimately matters. Radical feminism rejects this idea because, in their view,
799920	804500	it does nothing to actually liberate women as a class, to the point that individual women
804500	809240	who choose more traditional lifestyles are traitors to feminism. This is the everything
809240	813940	is political, even your personal choices view that my Gramsci video went into detail about.
813940	818620	If you're a true revolutionary, then you have an obligation to make revolutionary choices
818620	823220	even if that's not what you personally want. And every time a choice feminist promotes
823220	827700	a more traditional lifestyle, they set the feminist movement back because other women
827700	833160	might be influenced by their happiness and fulfilled life to also abandon being a revolutionary.
833160	838440	Unsurprisingly, by 2023, in the face of the left's ongoing radicalization, choice feminism
838440	843200	is pretty much nonexistent among progressives due to it being too liberal, too individualistic,
843200	847400	and too bourgeois. The radfem critique of it is that because it doesn't institutionally
847400	851600	challenge the status quo, because it carves out a private domain where politics don't
851600	855200	apply, because it gives women the choice to not be a revolutionary if that's in their
855200	859100	heart, it is ultimately reactionary. In any case, it's at the bottom of all of this
859100	864220	is that human sexuality is fun, and being edgy is fun too. Everybody enjoys feeling
864220	868300	like they've left the safe, known bounds of what their culture considers acceptable,
868300	871580	and they're now out in the wilderness, in the uncharted lands. Everybody knows what
871580	875900	it feels like when the call of exploration and adventure beckons, even only if in terms
875900	880460	of thoughts or speech. Everyone knows the thrill of doing or saying or even thinking
880460	884820	something considered taboo, but the moral foundations of the progressive are overwhelmingly
884820	889200	preoccupied with safety, to the point that they seek to kill any sort of true exploratory
889200	893120	impulse, care harm over everything else in heights terms. On the internet, it's pretty
893120	896560	easy to keep up the safety larp, where progressives pretend that they're on the edge when they're
896560	900920	actually not. At least it was for a while. But like with the Hassan example earlier,
900920	906460	it all falls apart once you look at what people actually do in real life. Right now, progressive
906460	912600	logic dictates that sex is simultaneously so safe and so fun and ultimately so inconsequential
912600	916620	that you can have it with anyone you like, any time you like, and any restriction on
916620	920820	any sexuality whatsoever is oppressive, to the point that twerking in front of kids at
920820	925540	pride parades is just harmless fun and hurts no one, while at the exact same time, sex
925540	930860	is so dangerous and so potentially damaging that you need constant reaffirmation of consent
930860	935340	signed across multiple forms and filed away with the campus security office before you
935340	940380	even ask a girl out because the slightest wrong move is so traumatizing to your partner
940380	944520	that you're a rapist and should absolutely be fired and cancelled and drummed out of
944520	949440	polite society. These two ideas just don't fit together. A guy shooting his shot, getting
949440	953960	rejected, and then leaving the girl alone means that that girl was traumatized or microaggressed
953960	959280	or stare raped or whatever the fuck is a sexual moral code that does not allow for free love
959280	964680	and open, consequence-free sexuality. Unless the progressive goal isn't actually sexual
964680	969720	liberation. It is to use sexuality as a method by which they control their political enemies.
969720	974500	Which by the way, is what a lot of ruling classes have done across human history. That
974500	979280	is what safe horny really means. They're allowed to simp and drool under every Only
979280	983860	Fan's Thoughts page because they vote for pro sex work policies. But if you do it, you're
983860	988580	a male gazing misogynist. They can create sexual content for others to enjoy because
988580	992840	the big boobs that they draw are empowering women with that body type. But if you do it,
992840	996960	you're oppressing those women through objectification and playing into stereotypes. They can fuck
996960	1000920	prostitutes because they've read theory about the political dynamics of prostitution.
1000920	1005380	But if you do it, you're an enabler of sex trafficking. Safe horny simply describes the
1005380	1010300	moral license to be sexual in the midst of progressive puritanism. Safe edgy fundamentally
1010300	1014280	works the same way. They spend so much time inventing slurs for white people and they're
1014280	1018980	all like water rolling off a duck's back. But one slur for black people and they instantly
1018980	1023660	lose their minds. And by the way, that is how you combat all of this. If they complain
1023660	1027940	that your sexuality is objectifying, just say, yes, it is. Yes, I will objectify. Yes,
1027940	1031500	I will trigger you with slurs. Fuck them. If they're going to play this one sided
1031500	1035420	game, I'm more than willing to force it to be equal. Crying to them about how it's
1035420	1039320	not fair is simply accepting that you're fighting with one hand tied behind your back.
1039320	1043420	So it's far better to simply say to them, yes, I'm going to do everything you do.
1043420	1047860	And no, I don't care if you approve of it or not. I don't need to take your moral
1047860	1050740	judgment into consideration because you are immoral.
