1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,300
Have you ever heard of the concept of safe horny? It's a relatively new term, first

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:16,540
used on Twitter on April 3rd, 2023. Overwatch 2's newest support hero at the time, Life

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,820
Weaver, was just announced. Polygon wrote this article about the character.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,920
Overwatch 2's next support hero has been revealed and confirmed to be hot. The attached

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,920
image shows a brown-skinned man with fabulous hair and an open robe revealing his chiseled

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,260
chest. This guy is entirely cut from the cloth of 90s anime bishounen characters.

7
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:44,420
Joe Longballs on Twitter replied to the article saying, they got a safe horny hero out and

8
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,860
poly to talk about him. They must have ran over an employee in the parking lot this time.

9
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,260
The joke is, every time Blizzard gets into a bit of legal trouble or a new story comes

10
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,480
out of the company about sexual harassment or bullying, they respond by announcing a

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,120
new gay or trans or non-binary or whatever the fuck character in Overwatch. Or they announce

12
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,920
that an old character has also been secretly gay or trans or non-binary this whole time.

13
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,180
Of course, Polygon and other games journalist outlets have no shortage of articles condemning

14
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:19,660
straight men or gamers or really anybody who's not protected by progressivism as being objectifying.

15
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,880
The male gaze is an oppressive force hovering over gaming. And if you like characters with

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,420
fat tits or something, you're a misogynist. Which is why it's so strange that they focus

17
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:34,120
on life weavers attractiveness. Is this also not objectifying? Is this not also the female

18
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,640
gaze or the gay man's gaze or whatever? That's why it's called safe horny. This is a type

19
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,520
of attraction you're allowed to show in public, unashamedly, by progressive standards. Your

20
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,920
sexuality is bad and oppressive. Their sexuality is good and empowering.

21
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,640
The interesting thing about language and human cognition is that as soon as somebody

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,700
coins a phrase for a phenomenon that intuitively makes sense, immediately other concepts and

23
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,760
examples start to come into focus. It was always kind of strange that, back when Resident

24
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,380
Evil Village launched in 2021, leftoids were publicly drooling over the eight-foot-tall

25
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:16,440
dommy mommy that is Lady Demisgryu. Isn't this sexually objectifying a female character?

26
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,080
But now it makes sense. It's safe horny. Same thing with the reaction to Ganondorf's muscle-bound

27
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,960
samurai redesign in The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, or the reaction to Ryu's beard

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,640
in Street Fighter 6. Now that we have a term for this behavior, safe horny, it becomes

29
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,940
a lot easier to understand. And seeing how safe horny works with trans characters actually

30
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,800
reveals some additional information. In my previous video, the one about how Link from

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,000
Legend of Zelda is often reimagined as gay or trans by progressive fans who demand representation

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,440
in a series and from a company that doesn't really care about that concept. I made the

33
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,020
point that a lot of arguments used to declare characters as gay or trans appeals to stereotypes

34
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,120
that if they were invoked by anybody other than progressives would be considered bigoted.

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,280
An old stereotype about trans people is that trans women and male crossdressers are the

36
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,160
same thing. They're not because trans women experience gender dysphoria, which is a mental

37
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,760
illness with symptoms and legitimate suffering. The best treatment for which we've discovered

38
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,160
so far is the transition. Meanwhile, crossdressers are people who have a fetish for dressing

39
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,240
up in the other gender's clothing. It gets them off to dress up in clothes that specifically

40
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,880
are not suited for them, that it is taboo for them to wear. An old stereotype about

41
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,420
trans women is that they're both crossdressers and gay men. But not all gay men actually

42
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,680
crossdress. And as far as I know, simply being attracted to the same sex doesn't come with

43
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,680
dysphoria.

44
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,640
So by the progressive standard, conflating crossdressers with trans women is transphobic.

45
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,640
And yet, when Link in Breath of the Wild or Cloud in Final Fantasy VII dress as women

46
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,880
in order to infiltrate female-only spaces, the all-women city of the Gerudo and Don Corneo's

47
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,180
brothel respectively, this is considered evidence by progressive fans that those characters

48
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,140
are actually trans. They're not even crossdressing as a fetish, they're doing it out of necessity.

49
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,720
This essentially shows the nature of these one-sided rules. If a progressive looks at

50
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,660
a crossdressing male and declares them trans, that's empowering and positive representation.

51
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,980
If anybody else looks at a crossdressing male and declares them trans, that's bigoted

52
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,400
and transphobic.

53
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,040
One of the rules of safe horny seems to be that if your politics are correct, then the

54
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,980
use of normally offensive stereotypes in the creation of safe horny is actually okay. According

55
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,740
to the progressive lens, it's not bigoted if the right person with the right beliefs

56
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,260
does the same damn thing that any bigot would do.

57
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,500
Being the old man that I am, I remember the progressive reaction to Dragon's Crown, a

58
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,940
2013 PlayStation 3 game. The sorceress class in that game is a big boobed anime woman,

59
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,900
and game journalists of the time collectively lost their fucking minds over it. The thing

60
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,620
is though, this is actually the art style of Dragon's Crown. The other characters

61
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,900
are also hyper-exaggerated. The elf is a loli with giga-thick thighs, the fighter has about

62
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,020
80% of his body mass in his chest and shoulders, and the dwarf is just a fucking brick. The

63
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,620
only halfway normal-looking character is the wizard, who still has some weirdly long limbs.

64
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,740
In general, the art of Dragon's Crown is specifically meant to be grotesque caricatures,

65
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,220
but 2013's progressives focused mainly on the sorceress because of her tits, and a little

66
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,440
on Amazon because of her ass. Compare that to the progressive response to objectified

67
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,660
or objectifiable female characters today. What changed? Is it that progressives have

68
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,260
themselves become less puritanical? Maybe, but I don't think so. Is it because, now

69
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,180
that there's more progressives in the gaming space, now that the space has the correct

70
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,420
politics, they're free to objectify because their desires are good and yours are bad?

71
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,340
Bingo. Now, some people online believe that the safe horny phenomenon isn't necessarily

72
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,660
related to politics, but more to the idea that characters that are less traditionally

73
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,780
sexualized are actually more sexualizable. Lady Dommy Mommy from before doesn't wear

74
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,180
traditionally sexy clothing, so she can be made more sexual by progressives. But characters

75
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,940
that are more overtly sexual themselves, like sorceress, they're objectifying. This also

76
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,140
explains Link in Cloud's crossdressing reaction too. But I'm not entirely sure this explanation

77
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,220
is accurate. I mean, it's probably partially accurate, but I also think that you cannot

78
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,400
ignore the political variable, where the same sexualization is empowering by progs and objectifying

79
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,180
by non-progs. And there's two reasons why I think you can't ignore the politics. Firstly,

80
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,860
it's very easy to just take a quick look at the types of accounts that do this sort of

81
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,420
canceling. My friend V got in trouble for this tweet recently. I am willing to pay $90

82
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,820
for this. Why won't you take my cash Western Corporation? Sorry, I can't do a Romanian

83
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,500
accent. The left picture is of the ugly fable girl and the right picture is what gamers

84
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,000
apparently actually want. Progressives immediately brigaded V for desiring sexualized attractive

85
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,080
women in video games, saying that gamers are still misogynists or that porn has rotted

86
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,780
their brains or whatever. And yet, checking out the likes tab of all of these accounts

87
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,440
shows that each and every single one of them has no problem with lewd content. Just like

88
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,300
how Republican politicians commonly have secret stashes of gay or trans porn, puritanical

89
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,800
progressives who love to police the male gays have no problem beating the meat to their

90
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,840
selection of safe horny content. Modern progs claim to be the most sexually permissible

91
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,280
group humanity's ever seen, and yet they still demand that anything sexual that they

92
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,660
specifically don't approve of is censored. The second reason has to do with a concept

93
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,520
related to safe horny, called safe edgy. In fact, it seems accurate to consider safe horny

94
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,580
to be a subset of safe edgy. You ever see those jokes about the British or the French,

95
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,740
or more broadly white people in general, that if they were made about some non-European

96
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,920
ethnicity would be considered totally unacceptable? That is safe edgy. It sounds like you're

97
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,960
saying something edgy, like you're really sticking your neck out there with this hot

98
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,360
take, but it's actually the easiest fucking thing you can say and you have no risk of

99
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,200
actually receiving any blowback from it. The safe edgy starter pack went viral in 2022

100
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,480
and it pretty much has the whole thing wrapped up into one neat package. Safe edgy people

101
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:56,260
are overwhelmingly leftists who still believe that they are the cultural underdog. Despite

102
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:01,040
the fact that corporations parrot their positions, organizations promote their ideas, major talking

103
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,180
heads show open support for their movements, and disagreeing with their politics in public

104
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,040
is a cancelable offense.

105
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:13,120
Probably the most telling example of safe edgy is Satanism in 2023. Satanism, the modern

106
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,120
day satanic temple thing, came about primarily as a way for punks to fuck with pearl-clutching

107
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,120
Christians fifty years ago, and that's a job it did pretty well. It was actually edgy

108
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,220
back then. But now? Do people still genuinely believe the satanic temple is edgy in 2023?

109
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,760
Check this cringe shit out.

110
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,900
I had a blast at the satanic temple today. Blessed be, inhale thyself. I did not know

111
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,760
they let you snuggle up to Baphomet for selfies. Yep, when you go up to the front door and

112
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,160
wait for someone to come out to check your vaccination card and give you masks, then

113
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,280
he lets you in and goes over the rules. Sitting on Baphomet is allowed and even encouraged.

114
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,680
Oh wow, you're really pushing the fucking boundaries here. If you wanted to really be

115
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,560
edgy, maybe you should try to actually remove the mask and see what happens. To truly be

116
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,280
edgy, to actually be the underdog, means that society by and large has to reject your ideas

117
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,680
and exclude you from participation in it for holding those ideas. For example, during COVID,

118
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,800
being edgy meant not wearing a mask and not getting vaccinated.

119
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,940
Now I'm not saying whether that's right or wrong. I'm saying that going against the

120
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:18,640
grain means that you specifically do not do what the majority of people around you do.

121
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,760
You don't listen to the advice of normative institutions demanding that you must do something.

122
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,200
Being edgy doesn't mean being compliant. When there's a pride flag on every street corner,

123
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,660
gay people aren't edgy anymore. They're normal. And that's why you see Gen Z teens sometimes

124
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,200
rebel against pride stuff in schools. Not because they've been groomed to be Nazis,

125
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,000
whatever dumbfuck nonsense the progs say, but because teens are naturally rebellious

126
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,200
against the order that adults have set up, as a part of their exploratory phase of their

127
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,960
development. If the world around them is pro-queer, then they will be anti-queer, at least superficially,

128
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,160
simply to experience what it's like. And, of course, whenever you confront people who

129
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:03,160
are safe edgy about their larping, they immediately transform into snowflakes. You can find progs

130
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,280
all over the place saying that cis white males, they're so fragile, they're angry about everything,

131
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,680
white male rage, but the minute that you drop an n-bomb, they collapse into a screeching

132
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,760
pile of blubber. They cannot actually tolerate the existence of truly edgy stuff because

133
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,660
it puts on display how safe their positions actually are. They want the clout of being

134
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,520
the counterculture without actually being on the outside because they are the institutions,

135
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,340
they are the source of normative principles now. This is partially what I was getting

136
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:36,040
at when I made my conservatism is the counterculture video years ago, which funnily enough was

137
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,500
Vosch's first exposure to my content. Like the brainlet he is, he believes that I was

138
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,260
actually saying conservatism is punk rock because that was the gateway metaphor I used.

139
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,440
And I still occasionally hear screams from his fanbase about it. Good times. There's

140
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,040
a lot of different intersecting principles here. The idea of trolls remorse, that a lot

141
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,660
of the people who are now safe edgy or safe horny also used to be actually edgy. And by

142
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,320
actually edgy, I mean they used to watch iDubbbz videos in what they now call their alt-right

143
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,580
pipeline phase, something they feel like they have to be publicly remorseful for. There's

144
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,700
also the nature of power, what is gained by claiming something as the normative position

145
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,860
around which other modes of thought deviate from, while also understanding that the outsider

146
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,900
position from that normative center brings with it its own benefits. There's also the

147
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:25,160
idea of freedom itself. What does it mean to be free in the face of the concept of safety?

148
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,560
Being safe brings with it a degree of freedom since you don't need to worry about outside

149
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,380
interference as much. But the mechanisms that secure that safety can also stifle freedom.

150
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:38,600
If you're free from safety, is that liberating or endangering? Is it both? Each of these

151
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,380
ideas are deserving of their own video, so I'll be doing them as follow-ups. But insofar

152
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,780
as this conversation goes, the main reason this video isn't an indefensible, despite

153
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,580
a huge chunk of the safe horny stuff revolving around video games, is because progressives

154
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,220
also do this to real-life people. Here's Elon Musk liking a post by the red-headed

155
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,960
libertarian who is an attractive young woman. The post is a meme about Elliot Page replacing

156
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,960
the Protect Trans Kids shirt with Sterilize Autistic Kids. Hassan replied to this by saying

157
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,880
Elon is autistic and he has a trans kid, but he's such a horny reply guy that he forgot.

158
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,980
Hold on a minute, we're living in the progressive sex-positive empowering future, right? What

159
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,840
is exactly wrong with being a horny reply guy? Every single bread-tuber and progressive

160
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,680
on the fucking platform posts ooh-woo, I am respectfully looking, with sweating emojis

161
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,940
underneath every single 5 out of 10 OnlyFans art hoe, while Hassan himself has flown to

162
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:34,140
Europe to fuck sex slaves held in a brothel. This is fundamentally why I don't think it's

163
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:40,300
about the left becoming less puritanical over time, but it is at its core a political conversation.

164
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:46,060
To the progs, leftist sexuality good, non-leftist sexuality bad, simple as. They make fun of

165
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:51,120
tradwives and monogamy and people who want that lifestyle or engage with those communities

166
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,700
because it's not a form of sexuality that they politically approve of. This whole discussion

167
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,700
is an outgrowth of the choice feminism stuff from the 2010s. Choice feminism posited that

168
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,300
the feminist project is fulfilled if women have the choice to do what they want. If individual

169
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,620
women choose to be tradwives and homemakers instead of being sexually promiscuous because

170
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:14,540
they actually want that, then it's still a feminist act because it's the agency of

171
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,920
women that ultimately matters. Radical feminism rejects this idea because, in their view,

172
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,500
it does nothing to actually liberate women as a class, to the point that individual women

173
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,240
who choose more traditional lifestyles are traitors to feminism. This is the everything

174
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,940
is political, even your personal choices view that my Gramsci video went into detail about.

175
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:38,620
If you're a true revolutionary, then you have an obligation to make revolutionary choices

176
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,220
even if that's not what you personally want. And every time a choice feminist promotes

177
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,700
a more traditional lifestyle, they set the feminist movement back because other women

178
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:53,160
might be influenced by their happiness and fulfilled life to also abandon being a revolutionary.

179
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:58,440
Unsurprisingly, by 2023, in the face of the left's ongoing radicalization, choice feminism

180
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,200
is pretty much nonexistent among progressives due to it being too liberal, too individualistic,

181
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,400
and too bourgeois. The radfem critique of it is that because it doesn't institutionally

182
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,600
challenge the status quo, because it carves out a private domain where politics don't

183
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,200
apply, because it gives women the choice to not be a revolutionary if that's in their

184
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,100
heart, it is ultimately reactionary. In any case, it's at the bottom of all of this

185
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,220
is that human sexuality is fun, and being edgy is fun too. Everybody enjoys feeling

186
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:28,300
like they've left the safe, known bounds of what their culture considers acceptable,

187
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,580
and they're now out in the wilderness, in the uncharted lands. Everybody knows what

188
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,900
it feels like when the call of exploration and adventure beckons, even only if in terms

189
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,460
of thoughts or speech. Everyone knows the thrill of doing or saying or even thinking

190
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,820
something considered taboo, but the moral foundations of the progressive are overwhelmingly

191
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,200
preoccupied with safety, to the point that they seek to kill any sort of true exploratory

192
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,120
impulse, care harm over everything else in heights terms. On the internet, it's pretty

193
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,560
easy to keep up the safety larp, where progressives pretend that they're on the edge when they're

194
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,920
actually not. At least it was for a while. But like with the Hassan example earlier,

195
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:06,460
it all falls apart once you look at what people actually do in real life. Right now, progressive

196
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:12,600
logic dictates that sex is simultaneously so safe and so fun and ultimately so inconsequential

197
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,620
that you can have it with anyone you like, any time you like, and any restriction on

198
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,820
any sexuality whatsoever is oppressive, to the point that twerking in front of kids at

199
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,540
pride parades is just harmless fun and hurts no one, while at the exact same time, sex

200
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:30,860
is so dangerous and so potentially damaging that you need constant reaffirmation of consent

201
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,340
signed across multiple forms and filed away with the campus security office before you

202
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:40,380
even ask a girl out because the slightest wrong move is so traumatizing to your partner

203
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,520
that you're a rapist and should absolutely be fired and cancelled and drummed out of

204
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,440
polite society. These two ideas just don't fit together. A guy shooting his shot, getting

205
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,960
rejected, and then leaving the girl alone means that that girl was traumatized or microaggressed

206
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:59,280
or stare raped or whatever the fuck is a sexual moral code that does not allow for free love

207
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,680
and open, consequence-free sexuality. Unless the progressive goal isn't actually sexual

208
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,720
liberation. It is to use sexuality as a method by which they control their political enemies.

209
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,500
Which by the way, is what a lot of ruling classes have done across human history. That

210
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,280
is what safe horny really means. They're allowed to simp and drool under every Only

211
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,860
Fan's Thoughts page because they vote for pro sex work policies. But if you do it, you're

212
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,580
a male gazing misogynist. They can create sexual content for others to enjoy because

213
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,840
the big boobs that they draw are empowering women with that body type. But if you do it,

214
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,960
you're oppressing those women through objectification and playing into stereotypes. They can fuck

215
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,920
prostitutes because they've read theory about the political dynamics of prostitution.

216
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,380
But if you do it, you're an enabler of sex trafficking. Safe horny simply describes the

217
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,300
moral license to be sexual in the midst of progressive puritanism. Safe edgy fundamentally

218
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,280
works the same way. They spend so much time inventing slurs for white people and they're

219
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,980
all like water rolling off a duck's back. But one slur for black people and they instantly

220
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,660
lose their minds. And by the way, that is how you combat all of this. If they complain

221
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,940
that your sexuality is objectifying, just say, yes, it is. Yes, I will objectify. Yes,

222
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,500
I will trigger you with slurs. Fuck them. If they're going to play this one sided

223
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,420
game, I'm more than willing to force it to be equal. Crying to them about how it's

224
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,320
not fair is simply accepting that you're fighting with one hand tied behind your back.

225
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,420
So it's far better to simply say to them, yes, I'm going to do everything you do.

226
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,860
And no, I don't care if you approve of it or not. I don't need to take your moral

227
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,740
judgment into consideration because you are immoral.
