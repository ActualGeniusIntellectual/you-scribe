0	10080	Hey, y'all heard of the website Nexus Mods? I'm an old man, so I remember hanging out
10080	15720	on it as the Elder Scrolls source, or TES source, which is what it went by until 2007.
15720	20120	It began as a fan site for the Elder Scrolls III Morrowind, hosting music and artwork,
20120	24680	and most importantly, mods for the game. As the lifecycle of Morrowind ran its course,
24680	29980	and Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion took its place, the site became TES Nexus and began to host
29980	34780	mods for all of the Elder Scrolls games. As the site grew, they dropped the TES moniker,
34780	39280	probably both for copyright reasons and wanting to expand, and became a general site for hosting
39280	43180	mods of any game. And nowadays, it's the biggest mod site on the internet. I think it even gives
43180	46960	Steam's mod servers a run for its money. Being a site that has existed on the internet for this
46960	51660	long, Nexus Mods has naturally had its share of kerfuffles. Like, for example, the rather humorous
51660	55540	situation regarding the Miranda buttshots from Mass Effect. In the Mass Effect games,
55540	60940	the camera gratuitously fixates on Miranda's ass, and there's a mod on Nexus Mods to remove
60940	64820	those camera angles from the cutscenes. Some people like this idea. Others said that this
64820	70180	was Puritan SJW censorship. You know how this goes. But when EA released Mass Effect Legendary
70180	73900	Edition, a remaster of the original trilogy, the butt angles were taken out right at the source.
73900	78500	And also on Nexus Mods, you can find a mod to put them right back in. In fact,
78500	83660	both mods were made by the same guy. The duality of man. Another notable example is
83660	87820	Fallout the Frontier, which was a highly anticipated Fallout New Vegas mod worked on for
87820	92340	years. When it finally dropped on Nexus Mods in 2021, it actually crashed the site due to its
92340	96780	popularity. But after release, people began to realize there was some weird stuff in it. Most
96780	102780	notably, you have the option to have sex with deathclaws and enslave a young girl named America,
102780	108060	where she talks about how bad her feet smell. Yeesh. Fans began to dig into the people who
108060	111620	made the mod and discovered that one of them has an alt account where they posted some rather
111660	116140	extreme loli shit. I don't mean borderline stuff, where you're watching a hentai and there's like
116140	120060	a petite girl and it takes place in a high school, but everybody probably just hit the age of consent
120060	124180	or something. This stuff was legitimately quite hard to stomach. As all this shit was going down,
124180	127860	the contents of the modders discord leaked, where the creators of the mod said that nothing was
127860	132140	actually wrong with any of this. And it was all those pesky gamers fault for everything collapsing
132140	136620	in around them. But these are controversies by the creators of mods who use the Nexus Mods website,
136620	141380	nothing to do with the website itself. Well, while I was taking my post Kenobi break from SFO,
141620	147380	this bit of drama happened on Nexus Mods. The game Spider-Man Remastered hit PC and it's got pride
147380	153620	flags in it. A troll account on Nexus Mods with the name Mike Hawk uploaded a mod called Non-Newtonian
153620	158180	New York. The background of the mod features Newton using a prism to split light rays into
158180	163220	a rainbow and another guy saying dude stop. The mods description says replaces Newton's prism
163220	166900	artifacts with the stars and stripes. In case you don't get it, it takes pride flags and turns them
166900	171860	into American flags. Of course, this went viral on Twitter because Twitter is humanity's toilet.
171860	177180	Somebody made a mod for Spider-Man PC to turn the game homophobic. What the fuck? What the actual
177180	181020	fuck? This dude ended up locking his account over this. Lots of people here are trolling though.
181020	185060	Christina Tasty says I don't get how this is homophobic. This just changes the date the game
185060	189420	is set in from June 30th to July 1st, which is actually a pretty great response. However,
189420	194540	I shit you not. What actually seems to be going on here is that the mod set the region of the game
194540	199100	to the Middle East, where the pride flags aren't present. Hey, just like during the real life pride
199100	204220	month. Anyway, for some reason, this was enough for Nexus Mods to ban the Mike Hawk account,
204220	209180	ban the person's real account, and all other other mods, ban all re-uploads of the mod, and make this
209180	214140	blog post on the topic. In regards to the replacement of pride flags in this game, or any
214140	219660	game, our policy is thus. We are for inclusivity. We are for diversity. If we think someone is
219660	223900	uploading a mod on our site with the intention to deliberately be against inclusivity or diversity,
223980	228060	we will take action against it. The same goes for people attempting to troll other users with mods
228060	231900	deliberately to cause their eyes. For our part, we will endeavor to do a better job of moderating
231900	236540	our website. We aren't the authority on what users can and cannot mod. Us removing a mod only means
236540	240620	it can't be found at Nexus Mods. Nothing more, nothing less. We also know that we are not the
240620	244460	only site that has removed this mod from their platform. As a private business, we have a right
244460	248780	to choose what content we do and do not want to host on our platform. Respect this right the same
248780	253020	way you want respect for your rights. It's always great when progressives become the most ardent,
253020	256380	rightist, libertarian capitalists as soon as they benefit from it, right?
256380	261260	So, let's actually consider the ethic that Nexus Mods has decided to stand by. We are for
261260	265340	inclusivity. We are for diversity. If we think someone is uploading a mod on our site with the
265340	269340	intent to be deliberately against inclusivity or diversity, then we will take action against it.
269340	273740	Okay, that's probably why mods for the same game that turn pride flags into progress pride flags,
273740	278780	or American flags into pride flags are accepted. This idea only goes one way in the name of
278780	283740	diversity, inclusion, and equity. The owner of Nexus Mods, Robin Scott, started TES Source when
283740	288220	he was just 15 years old. He basically stumbled into the job because he just so happened to make
288220	292060	a fan site that took off when he was in high school. And for a long time, he had that old
292060	295980	internet ethic that a lot of us here presumably share. Live and let live. Don't get in my face,
295980	299900	I won't get in yours. You know, respecting people's privacy. For example, Scott hosts an
299900	304300	infrequent podcast where he talks about site updates and other site business. And during a
304300	309500	2012 episode, he had this to say about Puritans complaining about boob armor mods in the site.
309500	314300	You might not be the type of person who likes the skimpy armor clothes, so like your chainmail
314300	322620	bikinis and things like that. And it's quite hard when there's 2000 mods in the armor category to
322620	330700	find the armor that you care about, and not and remove or segment away all the chainmail bikinis
330700	334540	and the skimpy clothes and things like that, because all in the same category. And I'm aware
334540	341260	that that's a big issue. So focus our focus really is going to be on trying to allow you to customize
341260	345660	your view of the site to only see the content that you actually care about.
346220	352620	So we have a lot less people whining like little bitches about the chainmail bikini stuff and all
352620	356140	the stuff in between because you won't see it. And if you do see it, it's because you've chosen to
356140	359900	see and you've got no reason to complain then. And then I can just be like, well, I don't give
359900	363420	a crap. You can shut up. That's a pretty reasonable take, isn't it? Scott understands
363420	366380	that boob armor mods are popular. He also understands that there's so many of them,
366380	370220	it's blocking people's ability to get other types of armor mods. He calls people complaining about
370220	374540	seeing boobs at whiners while also understanding the need for a way to filter out those types of
374540	379100	mods on request. This isn't a progressive stance. This isn't pushing a specific type of politics.
379100	383660	It's saying fine, both pro boob and anti boob are welcome here. We'll just make it so that you
383660	387820	only get the content that you want. In 2015, Scott gave an interview to Rock Paper Shotgun,
387820	391900	where he describes his operating ethics. The context of this conversation is regarding the
391900	397340	possibility of paid mods, something that Bethesda themselves was exploring at the time. Scott says,
397340	401580	one of the main values of the Nexus sites has been respecting and supporting a mod's author right to
401580	406780	choose if, how and where they will distribute their mods, so long as it's legal. And I'm happy
406780	410540	for you that you now have the option to earn some money for your hard work, but you still can't do
410540	414780	that on the Nexus. If you upload your files to Nexus mods, you do it on the understanding that
414780	419260	Nexus mods is a completely free site for everyone. We can see a change in how Scott
419260	424780	views things. In 2012 and 2015, his ethic is basically openness. Everyone can participate.
424780	428060	If you don't like a type of content, don't engage with it. This is ironically enough,
428060	433100	actually diverse and inclusive. In 2022, he might talk about diversity and inclusivity,
433100	437740	but he's actively making the choice to disallow one specific type of mod. What changed?
437740	441660	During the 2020 election, Nexus mods actually went through a bit of trouble with its users.
441660	445820	A bunch of low-effort political mods were being uploaded to the site as the election approached,
445820	450220	and it was causing a bunch of flame wars in the comments. Scott's response was to ban all
450220	453900	political mods until after the election was over, because he didn't have the time or the energy to
453900	458540	deal with the escalating shitshow. And to his credit, this ban seems to have gone both ways.
458540	461740	There were mods for Fallout 4 that turned the Raiders into Antifa that were banned,
461740	465820	just as there were mods for Skyrim that allowed you to arrest Donald Trump that were also banned.
465820	470140	I mean, it still isn't great, at least not for me. No censorship is still better than censorship,
470140	474060	but at least Scott banned all of it. At least everyone played by the same rules.
474060	477660	But this is still part of a slow decay in his ethics.
477660	482700	In 2012, the Nexus mod attitude was, everyone is welcome, just chill out. In 2020, it was
482700	487660	everyone's welcome unless you don't chill out. And now, in 2022, it's only the views I support
487660	491820	are welcome. There has been a steady progression in how restrictive Scott's become over the years.
491820	496780	And I have a hunch as to why. In 2021, the Nexus Collections controversy happened.
496780	500780	This is a huge fucking deep lore hole that I don't think is really worth diving into.
500780	504780	So let me give you the short version of the story. In 2019, Scott and his team began working on a
504780	509100	project called Nexus Collections. The idea was, they wanted to make it easier for people to set
509100	513420	up an extensively modded game and also share that specific mod setup around. So on the site,
513420	517500	you could make what's called a collection. It's exactly as it sounds. You can put under one page
517500	521660	a bunch of different mods so that every time you reinstall, or if anybody else wanted to run what
521660	524940	you were running, rather than having to remember what each mod is and hunting down all the versions,
524940	528540	it would all be saved as one collection. You could just go and grab it. Pretty convenient,
528540	532620	right? However, the Nexus team realized that if modders ever deleted their mods for some reason,
532620	536940	it would break all the collections their mod was featured in. So their solution was to make it so
536940	541020	that nobody could ever delete mods off the site ever again. If you decided to nuke your account
541020	544540	and remove all your mods, they wouldn't actually be deleted. The original page of the mods might
544540	548700	say deleted, but any collection pages still referencing those mods would allow users to
548700	552940	download them. This decision prompted a gigantic backlash from the community. So much so that the
552940	557420	Nexus team actually ended up giving the modders a one month grace period to delete their mods from
557420	561660	the site. Originally, there was no grace period at all, but ultimately the change still went forward.
561660	564940	Today, nobody can delete their mods from the site. And if you miss the news and still want to,
564940	569020	you should have luck. While Nexus mods is still the site for modding your games,
569020	573020	their collections functionality is still kind of lackluster. It isn't really used too often.
573020	577180	For example, when people want a collection of mods for Skyrim, they don't use Nexus collections.
577180	581500	They use Wabbajack, named after the staff of the same name from the same game. Wabbajack is an
581500	585420	automated mod installer. It automatically searches Nexus mods as well as other online
585420	589500	mod locations and allows you to build a mod pack just like Nexus collections. But unlike
589500	593900	Nexus collections, Wabbajack actually checks over the files of the mods and uses its knowledge of
593900	597660	Skyrim's own files to determine whether or not the mods are actually compatible with each other.
597660	601420	Anybody can slap random shit into a Nexus collections list, but Wabbajack actually tries
601420	605100	to ensure that everything will work together. It's a neat little application. This is just my
605100	608140	own intuition, but I've been around the block enough that I think I know what happened. It
608140	611980	happened to Jack Conte over at Patreon. Happened to TotalBiscuit too, and my video about it back
611980	616140	in the day went viral. Everybody who has a cool new idea starts out like these guys. They're just
616140	619900	a part of the community like any other user. They build a website or a YouTube show or a business,
619900	624380	not necessarily hoping to become the king of the castle, but because as one of the many users on
624380	628780	the ground, they see a niche and they want to fill it for the sake of everyone. And as they grow more
628780	633100	successful and more of their fellow users start using their new innovation, they gradually stop
633100	637500	being a fellow user. Do you think YouTubers become more or less in touch with their viewers the
637500	641740	larger their channels grow? Jack Conte started Patreon with an idea and a passion, but do you
641740	645740	think that's still really there considering his behaviors in the past few years? Robin Scott
645740	649980	started TES Source as a teenage fan of Elder Scrolls. Is he the same person? Obviously not.
649980	653900	And some of that will be the natural process of maturity, but not all of it. People who start as
653900	657260	fans and then suddenly have fans of their own. People who spend most of their formative years
657260	661180	as consumers and then buy a roll of the dice find themselves creators or curators instead.
661180	664700	The attitude they take towards their growth often determines what they grow into down the line.
664700	669020	And there's so many examples. TotalBiscuit and Jack Conte are just a few of people who started
669020	673260	a big project, received significant pushback from their fans and ended up lashing out or even
673260	676940	hating them as a result. And while I haven't seen any definitive proof of this happening to Robin
676940	681740	Scott based on how he used to talk versus how he talks now, I have a feeling that it did. He
681740	686060	and his team got royally shit on by the community for the Nexus Collection shit show. They only
686060	690540	begrudgingly offered the one month grace period to allow people to take their mods off the site
690540	695100	and only after a ridiculous amount of backlash. And compared to his 2012 position from that
695100	700300	podcast we listened to or his 2015 position on the openness of the site, his current position
700300	704540	for the past few years has been entirely fuck you if you don't like it, leave. And hey, I can
704540	709500	respect that too. There are actually times where you are correct and your community is incorrect
709500	712940	and you need to stand your ground because you think it's the right thing to do. Popularity or
712940	716620	democracy is not what determines the truth. But all of these people I've been talking about,
716620	719980	they think that this position means you have to go to war with your own audience.
719980	723980	But that's just the ego talking. I know some of you have been listening to the past few minutes
723980	728220	of this video and wondering if and when the side effect of my growth will happen to old Devo. Some
728220	731740	of you act like it already has, simply because I don't acquiesce to your demands all the time. But
731740	737100	the golden mean between just say and do whatever your audience says and burn everything down and
737100	741980	make your audience hate you is stand by what you think is right but don't hate your audience for
741980	746540	disagreeing. It's humility. For example, I know how much at least some of you don't like Lilith
746540	750140	or the tubcast. Maybe you don't like some of her takes. And that's okay because I don't agree with
750140	754220	her all the time either. Maybe you just want to be rude because she's trans and I'll never support
754220	758700	that but you do you. Even if I think you're absolutely retarded or you're specifically here
758700	764060	just to be a hateful dick, I generally don't ban anybody from my chat unless they're being extremely
764060	768140	disruptive to the show or chasing other chatters or something. If you are one of my viewers who
768140	772620	specifically hates the tubcast or hates Lilith, I can disagree with you without going to war with
772620	777580	you. I won't stop doing what I want to do simply based on your say-so but I also won't think that
777580	782140	you're a villain or or not a real fan or something if you disagree with me. I think that's the
782140	785900	difference between me and the examples that I've talked about today. And I think that's where
785900	790700	Robin Scott is now. Again no real proof just a hunch and some of his circumstantial comments.
790700	795340	It's not just his my way or the highway point of view. It's that if you choose highway he thinks
795340	799420	you're a bigot. Not wanting pride flags in Spider-Man is as stupid as wanting them. Ain't it
799420	803740	just a flag? Who cares? Wanting them removed is kind of petty but so is flying them in the first
803740	808860	place. A modder taking pride flags down is no more or less homophobic than what a corporation
808860	812540	does at the end of June. In fact I know you expected this video to be about the flag itself
812540	816940	instead of nexus mods as a site but I'm actually saving that pride flag topic for another time.
816940	820060	In fact maybe we'll even do it tomorrow so uh I'll see you then.
