00:00.000 --> 00:10.080
Hey, y'all heard of the website Nexus Mods? I'm an old man, so I remember hanging out

00:10.080 --> 00:15.720
on it as the Elder Scrolls source, or TES source, which is what it went by until 2007.

00:15.720 --> 00:20.120
It began as a fan site for the Elder Scrolls III Morrowind, hosting music and artwork,

00:20.120 --> 00:24.680
and most importantly, mods for the game. As the lifecycle of Morrowind ran its course,

00:24.680 --> 00:29.980
and Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion took its place, the site became TES Nexus and began to host

00:29.980 --> 00:34.780
mods for all of the Elder Scrolls games. As the site grew, they dropped the TES moniker,

00:34.780 --> 00:39.280
probably both for copyright reasons and wanting to expand, and became a general site for hosting

00:39.280 --> 00:43.180
mods of any game. And nowadays, it's the biggest mod site on the internet. I think it even gives

00:43.180 --> 00:46.960
Steam's mod servers a run for its money. Being a site that has existed on the internet for this

00:46.960 --> 00:51.660
long, Nexus Mods has naturally had its share of kerfuffles. Like, for example, the rather humorous

00:51.660 --> 00:55.540
situation regarding the Miranda buttshots from Mass Effect. In the Mass Effect games,

00:55.540 --> 01:00.940
the camera gratuitously fixates on Miranda's ass, and there's a mod on Nexus Mods to remove

01:00.940 --> 01:04.820
those camera angles from the cutscenes. Some people like this idea. Others said that this

01:04.820 --> 01:10.180
was Puritan SJW censorship. You know how this goes. But when EA released Mass Effect Legendary

01:10.180 --> 01:13.900
Edition, a remaster of the original trilogy, the butt angles were taken out right at the source.

01:13.900 --> 01:18.500
And also on Nexus Mods, you can find a mod to put them right back in. In fact,

01:18.500 --> 01:23.660
both mods were made by the same guy. The duality of man. Another notable example is

01:23.660 --> 01:27.820
Fallout the Frontier, which was a highly anticipated Fallout New Vegas mod worked on for

01:27.820 --> 01:32.340
years. When it finally dropped on Nexus Mods in 2021, it actually crashed the site due to its

01:32.340 --> 01:36.780
popularity. But after release, people began to realize there was some weird stuff in it. Most

01:36.780 --> 01:42.780
notably, you have the option to have sex with deathclaws and enslave a young girl named America,

01:42.780 --> 01:48.060
where she talks about how bad her feet smell. Yeesh. Fans began to dig into the people who

01:48.060 --> 01:51.620
made the mod and discovered that one of them has an alt account where they posted some rather

01:51.660 --> 01:56.140
extreme loli shit. I don't mean borderline stuff, where you're watching a hentai and there's like

01:56.140 --> 02:00.060
a petite girl and it takes place in a high school, but everybody probably just hit the age of consent

02:00.060 --> 02:04.180
or something. This stuff was legitimately quite hard to stomach. As all this shit was going down,

02:04.180 --> 02:07.860
the contents of the modders discord leaked, where the creators of the mod said that nothing was

02:07.860 --> 02:12.140
actually wrong with any of this. And it was all those pesky gamers fault for everything collapsing

02:12.140 --> 02:16.620
in around them. But these are controversies by the creators of mods who use the Nexus Mods website,

02:16.620 --> 02:21.380
nothing to do with the website itself. Well, while I was taking my post Kenobi break from SFO,

02:21.620 --> 02:27.380
this bit of drama happened on Nexus Mods. The game Spider-Man Remastered hit PC and it's got pride

02:27.380 --> 02:33.620
flags in it. A troll account on Nexus Mods with the name Mike Hawk uploaded a mod called Non-Newtonian

02:33.620 --> 02:38.180
New York. The background of the mod features Newton using a prism to split light rays into

02:38.180 --> 02:43.220
a rainbow and another guy saying dude stop. The mods description says replaces Newton's prism

02:43.220 --> 02:46.900
artifacts with the stars and stripes. In case you don't get it, it takes pride flags and turns them

02:46.900 --> 02:51.860
into American flags. Of course, this went viral on Twitter because Twitter is humanity's toilet.

02:51.860 --> 02:57.180
Somebody made a mod for Spider-Man PC to turn the game homophobic. What the fuck? What the actual

02:57.180 --> 03:01.020
fuck? This dude ended up locking his account over this. Lots of people here are trolling though.

03:01.020 --> 03:05.060
Christina Tasty says I don't get how this is homophobic. This just changes the date the game

03:05.060 --> 03:09.420
is set in from June 30th to July 1st, which is actually a pretty great response. However,

03:09.420 --> 03:14.540
I shit you not. What actually seems to be going on here is that the mod set the region of the game

03:14.540 --> 03:19.100
to the Middle East, where the pride flags aren't present. Hey, just like during the real life pride

03:19.100 --> 03:24.220
month. Anyway, for some reason, this was enough for Nexus Mods to ban the Mike Hawk account,

03:24.220 --> 03:29.180
ban the person's real account, and all other other mods, ban all re-uploads of the mod, and make this

03:29.180 --> 03:34.140
blog post on the topic. In regards to the replacement of pride flags in this game, or any

03:34.140 --> 03:39.660
game, our policy is thus. We are for inclusivity. We are for diversity. If we think someone is

03:39.660 --> 03:43.900
uploading a mod on our site with the intention to deliberately be against inclusivity or diversity,

03:43.980 --> 03:48.060
we will take action against it. The same goes for people attempting to troll other users with mods

03:48.060 --> 03:51.900
deliberately to cause their eyes. For our part, we will endeavor to do a better job of moderating

03:51.900 --> 03:56.540
our website. We aren't the authority on what users can and cannot mod. Us removing a mod only means

03:56.540 --> 04:00.620
it can't be found at Nexus Mods. Nothing more, nothing less. We also know that we are not the

04:00.620 --> 04:04.460
only site that has removed this mod from their platform. As a private business, we have a right

04:04.460 --> 04:08.780
to choose what content we do and do not want to host on our platform. Respect this right the same

04:08.780 --> 04:13.020
way you want respect for your rights. It's always great when progressives become the most ardent,

04:13.020 --> 04:16.380
rightist, libertarian capitalists as soon as they benefit from it, right?

04:16.380 --> 04:21.260
So, let's actually consider the ethic that Nexus Mods has decided to stand by. We are for

04:21.260 --> 04:25.340
inclusivity. We are for diversity. If we think someone is uploading a mod on our site with the

04:25.340 --> 04:29.340
intent to be deliberately against inclusivity or diversity, then we will take action against it.

04:29.340 --> 04:33.740
Okay, that's probably why mods for the same game that turn pride flags into progress pride flags,

04:33.740 --> 04:38.780
or American flags into pride flags are accepted. This idea only goes one way in the name of

04:38.780 --> 04:43.740
diversity, inclusion, and equity. The owner of Nexus Mods, Robin Scott, started TES Source when

04:43.740 --> 04:48.220
he was just 15 years old. He basically stumbled into the job because he just so happened to make

04:48.220 --> 04:52.060
a fan site that took off when he was in high school. And for a long time, he had that old

04:52.060 --> 04:55.980
internet ethic that a lot of us here presumably share. Live and let live. Don't get in my face,

04:55.980 --> 04:59.900
I won't get in yours. You know, respecting people's privacy. For example, Scott hosts an

04:59.900 --> 05:04.300
infrequent podcast where he talks about site updates and other site business. And during a

05:04.300 --> 05:09.500
2012 episode, he had this to say about Puritans complaining about boob armor mods in the site.

05:09.500 --> 05:14.300
You might not be the type of person who likes the skimpy armor clothes, so like your chainmail

05:14.300 --> 05:22.620
bikinis and things like that. And it's quite hard when there's 2000 mods in the armor category to

05:22.620 --> 05:30.700
find the armor that you care about, and not and remove or segment away all the chainmail bikinis

05:30.700 --> 05:34.540
and the skimpy clothes and things like that, because all in the same category. And I'm aware

05:34.540 --> 05:41.260
that that's a big issue. So focus our focus really is going to be on trying to allow you to customize

05:41.260 --> 05:45.660
your view of the site to only see the content that you actually care about.

05:46.220 --> 05:52.620
So we have a lot less people whining like little bitches about the chainmail bikini stuff and all

05:52.620 --> 05:56.140
the stuff in between because you won't see it. And if you do see it, it's because you've chosen to

05:56.140 --> 05:59.900
see and you've got no reason to complain then. And then I can just be like, well, I don't give

05:59.900 --> 06:03.420
a crap. You can shut up. That's a pretty reasonable take, isn't it? Scott understands

06:03.420 --> 06:06.380
that boob armor mods are popular. He also understands that there's so many of them,

06:06.380 --> 06:10.220
it's blocking people's ability to get other types of armor mods. He calls people complaining about

06:10.220 --> 06:14.540
seeing boobs at whiners while also understanding the need for a way to filter out those types of

06:14.540 --> 06:19.100
mods on request. This isn't a progressive stance. This isn't pushing a specific type of politics.

06:19.100 --> 06:23.660
It's saying fine, both pro boob and anti boob are welcome here. We'll just make it so that you

06:23.660 --> 06:27.820
only get the content that you want. In 2015, Scott gave an interview to Rock Paper Shotgun,

06:27.820 --> 06:31.900
where he describes his operating ethics. The context of this conversation is regarding the

06:31.900 --> 06:37.340
possibility of paid mods, something that Bethesda themselves was exploring at the time. Scott says,

06:37.340 --> 06:41.580
one of the main values of the Nexus sites has been respecting and supporting a mod's author right to

06:41.580 --> 06:46.780
choose if, how and where they will distribute their mods, so long as it's legal. And I'm happy

06:46.780 --> 06:50.540
for you that you now have the option to earn some money for your hard work, but you still can't do

06:50.540 --> 06:54.780
that on the Nexus. If you upload your files to Nexus mods, you do it on the understanding that

06:54.780 --> 06:59.260
Nexus mods is a completely free site for everyone. We can see a change in how Scott

06:59.260 --> 07:04.780
views things. In 2012 and 2015, his ethic is basically openness. Everyone can participate.

07:04.780 --> 07:08.060
If you don't like a type of content, don't engage with it. This is ironically enough,

07:08.060 --> 07:13.100
actually diverse and inclusive. In 2022, he might talk about diversity and inclusivity,

07:13.100 --> 07:17.740
but he's actively making the choice to disallow one specific type of mod. What changed?

07:17.740 --> 07:21.660
During the 2020 election, Nexus mods actually went through a bit of trouble with its users.

07:21.660 --> 07:25.820
A bunch of low-effort political mods were being uploaded to the site as the election approached,

07:25.820 --> 07:30.220
and it was causing a bunch of flame wars in the comments. Scott's response was to ban all

07:30.220 --> 07:33.900
political mods until after the election was over, because he didn't have the time or the energy to

07:33.900 --> 07:38.540
deal with the escalating shitshow. And to his credit, this ban seems to have gone both ways.

07:38.540 --> 07:41.740
There were mods for Fallout 4 that turned the Raiders into Antifa that were banned,

07:41.740 --> 07:45.820
just as there were mods for Skyrim that allowed you to arrest Donald Trump that were also banned.

07:45.820 --> 07:50.140
I mean, it still isn't great, at least not for me. No censorship is still better than censorship,

07:50.140 --> 07:54.060
but at least Scott banned all of it. At least everyone played by the same rules.

07:54.060 --> 07:57.660
But this is still part of a slow decay in his ethics.

07:57.660 --> 08:02.700
In 2012, the Nexus mod attitude was, everyone is welcome, just chill out. In 2020, it was

08:02.700 --> 08:07.660
everyone's welcome unless you don't chill out. And now, in 2022, it's only the views I support

08:07.660 --> 08:11.820
are welcome. There has been a steady progression in how restrictive Scott's become over the years.

08:11.820 --> 08:16.780
And I have a hunch as to why. In 2021, the Nexus Collections controversy happened.

08:16.780 --> 08:20.780
This is a huge fucking deep lore hole that I don't think is really worth diving into.

08:20.780 --> 08:24.780
So let me give you the short version of the story. In 2019, Scott and his team began working on a

08:24.780 --> 08:29.100
project called Nexus Collections. The idea was, they wanted to make it easier for people to set

08:29.100 --> 08:33.420
up an extensively modded game and also share that specific mod setup around. So on the site,

08:33.420 --> 08:37.500
you could make what's called a collection. It's exactly as it sounds. You can put under one page

08:37.500 --> 08:41.660
a bunch of different mods so that every time you reinstall, or if anybody else wanted to run what

08:41.660 --> 08:44.940
you were running, rather than having to remember what each mod is and hunting down all the versions,

08:44.940 --> 08:48.540
it would all be saved as one collection. You could just go and grab it. Pretty convenient,

08:48.540 --> 08:52.620
right? However, the Nexus team realized that if modders ever deleted their mods for some reason,

08:52.620 --> 08:56.940
it would break all the collections their mod was featured in. So their solution was to make it so

08:56.940 --> 09:01.020
that nobody could ever delete mods off the site ever again. If you decided to nuke your account

09:01.020 --> 09:04.540
and remove all your mods, they wouldn't actually be deleted. The original page of the mods might

09:04.540 --> 09:08.700
say deleted, but any collection pages still referencing those mods would allow users to

09:08.700 --> 09:12.940
download them. This decision prompted a gigantic backlash from the community. So much so that the

09:12.940 --> 09:17.420
Nexus team actually ended up giving the modders a one month grace period to delete their mods from

09:17.420 --> 09:21.660
the site. Originally, there was no grace period at all, but ultimately the change still went forward.

09:21.660 --> 09:24.940
Today, nobody can delete their mods from the site. And if you miss the news and still want to,

09:24.940 --> 09:29.020
you should have luck. While Nexus mods is still the site for modding your games,

09:29.020 --> 09:33.020
their collections functionality is still kind of lackluster. It isn't really used too often.

09:33.020 --> 09:37.180
For example, when people want a collection of mods for Skyrim, they don't use Nexus collections.

09:37.180 --> 09:41.500
They use Wabbajack, named after the staff of the same name from the same game. Wabbajack is an

09:41.500 --> 09:45.420
automated mod installer. It automatically searches Nexus mods as well as other online

09:45.420 --> 09:49.500
mod locations and allows you to build a mod pack just like Nexus collections. But unlike

09:49.500 --> 09:53.900
Nexus collections, Wabbajack actually checks over the files of the mods and uses its knowledge of

09:53.900 --> 09:57.660
Skyrim's own files to determine whether or not the mods are actually compatible with each other.

09:57.660 --> 10:01.420
Anybody can slap random shit into a Nexus collections list, but Wabbajack actually tries

10:01.420 --> 10:05.100
to ensure that everything will work together. It's a neat little application. This is just my

10:05.100 --> 10:08.140
own intuition, but I've been around the block enough that I think I know what happened. It

10:08.140 --> 10:11.980
happened to Jack Conte over at Patreon. Happened to TotalBiscuit too, and my video about it back

10:11.980 --> 10:16.140
in the day went viral. Everybody who has a cool new idea starts out like these guys. They're just

10:16.140 --> 10:19.900
a part of the community like any other user. They build a website or a YouTube show or a business,

10:19.900 --> 10:24.380
not necessarily hoping to become the king of the castle, but because as one of the many users on

10:24.380 --> 10:28.780
the ground, they see a niche and they want to fill it for the sake of everyone. And as they grow more

10:28.780 --> 10:33.100
successful and more of their fellow users start using their new innovation, they gradually stop

10:33.100 --> 10:37.500
being a fellow user. Do you think YouTubers become more or less in touch with their viewers the

10:37.500 --> 10:41.740
larger their channels grow? Jack Conte started Patreon with an idea and a passion, but do you

10:41.740 --> 10:45.740
think that's still really there considering his behaviors in the past few years? Robin Scott

10:45.740 --> 10:49.980
started TES Source as a teenage fan of Elder Scrolls. Is he the same person? Obviously not.

10:49.980 --> 10:53.900
And some of that will be the natural process of maturity, but not all of it. People who start as

10:53.900 --> 10:57.260
fans and then suddenly have fans of their own. People who spend most of their formative years

10:57.260 --> 11:01.180
as consumers and then buy a roll of the dice find themselves creators or curators instead.

11:01.180 --> 11:04.700
The attitude they take towards their growth often determines what they grow into down the line.

11:04.700 --> 11:09.020
And there's so many examples. TotalBiscuit and Jack Conte are just a few of people who started

11:09.020 --> 11:13.260
a big project, received significant pushback from their fans and ended up lashing out or even

11:13.260 --> 11:16.940
hating them as a result. And while I haven't seen any definitive proof of this happening to Robin

11:16.940 --> 11:21.740
Scott based on how he used to talk versus how he talks now, I have a feeling that it did. He

11:21.740 --> 11:26.060
and his team got royally shit on by the community for the Nexus Collection shit show. They only

11:26.060 --> 11:30.540
begrudgingly offered the one month grace period to allow people to take their mods off the site

11:30.540 --> 11:35.100
and only after a ridiculous amount of backlash. And compared to his 2012 position from that

11:35.100 --> 11:40.300
podcast we listened to or his 2015 position on the openness of the site, his current position

11:40.300 --> 11:44.540
for the past few years has been entirely fuck you if you don't like it, leave. And hey, I can

11:44.540 --> 11:49.500
respect that too. There are actually times where you are correct and your community is incorrect

11:49.500 --> 11:52.940
and you need to stand your ground because you think it's the right thing to do. Popularity or

11:52.940 --> 11:56.620
democracy is not what determines the truth. But all of these people I've been talking about,

11:56.620 --> 11:59.980
they think that this position means you have to go to war with your own audience.

11:59.980 --> 12:03.980
But that's just the ego talking. I know some of you have been listening to the past few minutes

12:03.980 --> 12:08.220
of this video and wondering if and when the side effect of my growth will happen to old Devo. Some

12:08.220 --> 12:11.740
of you act like it already has, simply because I don't acquiesce to your demands all the time. But

12:11.740 --> 12:17.100
the golden mean between just say and do whatever your audience says and burn everything down and

12:17.100 --> 12:21.980
make your audience hate you is stand by what you think is right but don't hate your audience for

12:21.980 --> 12:26.540
disagreeing. It's humility. For example, I know how much at least some of you don't like Lilith

12:26.540 --> 12:30.140
or the tubcast. Maybe you don't like some of her takes. And that's okay because I don't agree with

12:30.140 --> 12:34.220
her all the time either. Maybe you just want to be rude because she's trans and I'll never support

12:34.220 --> 12:38.700
that but you do you. Even if I think you're absolutely retarded or you're specifically here

12:38.700 --> 12:44.060
just to be a hateful dick, I generally don't ban anybody from my chat unless they're being extremely

12:44.060 --> 12:48.140
disruptive to the show or chasing other chatters or something. If you are one of my viewers who

12:48.140 --> 12:52.620
specifically hates the tubcast or hates Lilith, I can disagree with you without going to war with

12:52.620 --> 12:57.580
you. I won't stop doing what I want to do simply based on your say-so but I also won't think that

12:57.580 --> 13:02.140
you're a villain or or not a real fan or something if you disagree with me. I think that's the

13:02.140 --> 13:05.900
difference between me and the examples that I've talked about today. And I think that's where

13:05.900 --> 13:10.700
Robin Scott is now. Again no real proof just a hunch and some of his circumstantial comments.

13:10.700 --> 13:15.340
It's not just his my way or the highway point of view. It's that if you choose highway he thinks

13:15.340 --> 13:19.420
you're a bigot. Not wanting pride flags in Spider-Man is as stupid as wanting them. Ain't it

13:19.420 --> 13:23.740
just a flag? Who cares? Wanting them removed is kind of petty but so is flying them in the first

13:23.740 --> 13:28.860
place. A modder taking pride flags down is no more or less homophobic than what a corporation

13:28.860 --> 13:32.540
does at the end of June. In fact I know you expected this video to be about the flag itself

13:32.540 --> 13:36.940
instead of nexus mods as a site but I'm actually saving that pride flag topic for another time.

13:36.940 --> 13:40.060
In fact maybe we'll even do it tomorrow so uh I'll see you then.
