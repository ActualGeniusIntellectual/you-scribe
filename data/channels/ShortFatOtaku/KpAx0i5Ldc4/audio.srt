00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,080
Hey, y'all heard of the website Nexus Mods? I'm an old man, so I remember hanging out

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,720
on it as the Elder Scrolls source, or TES source, which is what it went by until 2007.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,120
It began as a fan site for the Elder Scrolls III Morrowind, hosting music and artwork,

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,680
and most importantly, mods for the game. As the lifecycle of Morrowind ran its course,

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,980
and Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion took its place, the site became TES Nexus and began to host

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,780
mods for all of the Elder Scrolls games. As the site grew, they dropped the TES moniker,

7
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,280
probably both for copyright reasons and wanting to expand, and became a general site for hosting

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,180
mods of any game. And nowadays, it's the biggest mod site on the internet. I think it even gives

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,960
Steam's mod servers a run for its money. Being a site that has existed on the internet for this

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,660
long, Nexus Mods has naturally had its share of kerfuffles. Like, for example, the rather humorous

11
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,540
situation regarding the Miranda buttshots from Mass Effect. In the Mass Effect games,

12
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,940
the camera gratuitously fixates on Miranda's ass, and there's a mod on Nexus Mods to remove

13
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,820
those camera angles from the cutscenes. Some people like this idea. Others said that this

14
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:10,180
was Puritan SJW censorship. You know how this goes. But when EA released Mass Effect Legendary

15
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,900
Edition, a remaster of the original trilogy, the butt angles were taken out right at the source.

16
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,500
And also on Nexus Mods, you can find a mod to put them right back in. In fact,

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,660
both mods were made by the same guy. The duality of man. Another notable example is

18
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,820
Fallout the Frontier, which was a highly anticipated Fallout New Vegas mod worked on for

19
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,340
years. When it finally dropped on Nexus Mods in 2021, it actually crashed the site due to its

20
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,780
popularity. But after release, people began to realize there was some weird stuff in it. Most

21
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,780
notably, you have the option to have sex with deathclaws and enslave a young girl named America,

22
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,060
where she talks about how bad her feet smell. Yeesh. Fans began to dig into the people who

23
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,620
made the mod and discovered that one of them has an alt account where they posted some rather

24
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,140
extreme loli shit. I don't mean borderline stuff, where you're watching a hentai and there's like

25
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,060
a petite girl and it takes place in a high school, but everybody probably just hit the age of consent

26
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,180
or something. This stuff was legitimately quite hard to stomach. As all this shit was going down,

27
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,860
the contents of the modders discord leaked, where the creators of the mod said that nothing was

28
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,140
actually wrong with any of this. And it was all those pesky gamers fault for everything collapsing

29
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,620
in around them. But these are controversies by the creators of mods who use the Nexus Mods website,

30
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,380
nothing to do with the website itself. Well, while I was taking my post Kenobi break from SFO,

31
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:27,380
this bit of drama happened on Nexus Mods. The game Spider-Man Remastered hit PC and it's got pride

32
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:33,620
flags in it. A troll account on Nexus Mods with the name Mike Hawk uploaded a mod called Non-Newtonian

33
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,180
New York. The background of the mod features Newton using a prism to split light rays into

34
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:43,220
a rainbow and another guy saying dude stop. The mods description says replaces Newton's prism

35
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,900
artifacts with the stars and stripes. In case you don't get it, it takes pride flags and turns them

36
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,860
into American flags. Of course, this went viral on Twitter because Twitter is humanity's toilet.

37
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,180
Somebody made a mod for Spider-Man PC to turn the game homophobic. What the fuck? What the actual

38
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,020
fuck? This dude ended up locking his account over this. Lots of people here are trolling though.

39
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,060
Christina Tasty says I don't get how this is homophobic. This just changes the date the game

40
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,420
is set in from June 30th to July 1st, which is actually a pretty great response. However,

41
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,540
I shit you not. What actually seems to be going on here is that the mod set the region of the game

42
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,100
to the Middle East, where the pride flags aren't present. Hey, just like during the real life pride

43
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,220
month. Anyway, for some reason, this was enough for Nexus Mods to ban the Mike Hawk account,

44
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,180
ban the person's real account, and all other other mods, ban all re-uploads of the mod, and make this

45
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,140
blog post on the topic. In regards to the replacement of pride flags in this game, or any

46
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:39,660
game, our policy is thus. We are for inclusivity. We are for diversity. If we think someone is

47
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,900
uploading a mod on our site with the intention to deliberately be against inclusivity or diversity,

48
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,060
we will take action against it. The same goes for people attempting to troll other users with mods

49
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,900
deliberately to cause their eyes. For our part, we will endeavor to do a better job of moderating

50
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,540
our website. We aren't the authority on what users can and cannot mod. Us removing a mod only means

51
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,620
it can't be found at Nexus Mods. Nothing more, nothing less. We also know that we are not the

52
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,460
only site that has removed this mod from their platform. As a private business, we have a right

53
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,780
to choose what content we do and do not want to host on our platform. Respect this right the same

54
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,020
way you want respect for your rights. It's always great when progressives become the most ardent,

55
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,380
rightist, libertarian capitalists as soon as they benefit from it, right?

56
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,260
So, let's actually consider the ethic that Nexus Mods has decided to stand by. We are for

57
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,340
inclusivity. We are for diversity. If we think someone is uploading a mod on our site with the

58
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,340
intent to be deliberately against inclusivity or diversity, then we will take action against it.

59
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,740
Okay, that's probably why mods for the same game that turn pride flags into progress pride flags,

60
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,780
or American flags into pride flags are accepted. This idea only goes one way in the name of

61
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,740
diversity, inclusion, and equity. The owner of Nexus Mods, Robin Scott, started TES Source when

62
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,220
he was just 15 years old. He basically stumbled into the job because he just so happened to make

63
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,060
a fan site that took off when he was in high school. And for a long time, he had that old

64
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,980
internet ethic that a lot of us here presumably share. Live and let live. Don't get in my face,

65
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,900
I won't get in yours. You know, respecting people's privacy. For example, Scott hosts an

66
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,300
infrequent podcast where he talks about site updates and other site business. And during a

67
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,500
2012 episode, he had this to say about Puritans complaining about boob armor mods in the site.

68
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,300
You might not be the type of person who likes the skimpy armor clothes, so like your chainmail

69
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:22,620
bikinis and things like that. And it's quite hard when there's 2000 mods in the armor category to

70
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:30,700
find the armor that you care about, and not and remove or segment away all the chainmail bikinis

71
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,540
and the skimpy clothes and things like that, because all in the same category. And I'm aware

72
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:41,260
that that's a big issue. So focus our focus really is going to be on trying to allow you to customize

73
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,660
your view of the site to only see the content that you actually care about.

74
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:52,620
So we have a lot less people whining like little bitches about the chainmail bikini stuff and all

75
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,140
the stuff in between because you won't see it. And if you do see it, it's because you've chosen to

76
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,900
see and you've got no reason to complain then. And then I can just be like, well, I don't give

77
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,420
a crap. You can shut up. That's a pretty reasonable take, isn't it? Scott understands

78
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,380
that boob armor mods are popular. He also understands that there's so many of them,

79
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,220
it's blocking people's ability to get other types of armor mods. He calls people complaining about

80
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,540
seeing boobs at whiners while also understanding the need for a way to filter out those types of

81
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,100
mods on request. This isn't a progressive stance. This isn't pushing a specific type of politics.

82
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,660
It's saying fine, both pro boob and anti boob are welcome here. We'll just make it so that you

83
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,820
only get the content that you want. In 2015, Scott gave an interview to Rock Paper Shotgun,

84
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,900
where he describes his operating ethics. The context of this conversation is regarding the

85
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,340
possibility of paid mods, something that Bethesda themselves was exploring at the time. Scott says,

86
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,580
one of the main values of the Nexus sites has been respecting and supporting a mod's author right to

87
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,780
choose if, how and where they will distribute their mods, so long as it's legal. And I'm happy

88
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,540
for you that you now have the option to earn some money for your hard work, but you still can't do

89
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,780
that on the Nexus. If you upload your files to Nexus mods, you do it on the understanding that

90
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,260
Nexus mods is a completely free site for everyone. We can see a change in how Scott

91
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:04,780
views things. In 2012 and 2015, his ethic is basically openness. Everyone can participate.

92
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,060
If you don't like a type of content, don't engage with it. This is ironically enough,

93
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,100
actually diverse and inclusive. In 2022, he might talk about diversity and inclusivity,

94
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,740
but he's actively making the choice to disallow one specific type of mod. What changed?

95
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,660
During the 2020 election, Nexus mods actually went through a bit of trouble with its users.

96
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,820
A bunch of low-effort political mods were being uploaded to the site as the election approached,

97
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,220
and it was causing a bunch of flame wars in the comments. Scott's response was to ban all

98
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,900
political mods until after the election was over, because he didn't have the time or the energy to

99
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,540
deal with the escalating shitshow. And to his credit, this ban seems to have gone both ways.

100
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,740
There were mods for Fallout 4 that turned the Raiders into Antifa that were banned,

101
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,820
just as there were mods for Skyrim that allowed you to arrest Donald Trump that were also banned.

102
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,140
I mean, it still isn't great, at least not for me. No censorship is still better than censorship,

103
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,060
but at least Scott banned all of it. At least everyone played by the same rules.

104
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,660
But this is still part of a slow decay in his ethics.

105
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,700
In 2012, the Nexus mod attitude was, everyone is welcome, just chill out. In 2020, it was

106
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,660
everyone's welcome unless you don't chill out. And now, in 2022, it's only the views I support

107
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,820
are welcome. There has been a steady progression in how restrictive Scott's become over the years.

108
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,780
And I have a hunch as to why. In 2021, the Nexus Collections controversy happened.

109
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,780
This is a huge fucking deep lore hole that I don't think is really worth diving into.

110
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,780
So let me give you the short version of the story. In 2019, Scott and his team began working on a

111
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,100
project called Nexus Collections. The idea was, they wanted to make it easier for people to set

112
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,420
up an extensively modded game and also share that specific mod setup around. So on the site,

113
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,500
you could make what's called a collection. It's exactly as it sounds. You can put under one page

114
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,660
a bunch of different mods so that every time you reinstall, or if anybody else wanted to run what

115
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,940
you were running, rather than having to remember what each mod is and hunting down all the versions,

116
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,540
it would all be saved as one collection. You could just go and grab it. Pretty convenient,

117
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,620
right? However, the Nexus team realized that if modders ever deleted their mods for some reason,

118
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,940
it would break all the collections their mod was featured in. So their solution was to make it so

119
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,020
that nobody could ever delete mods off the site ever again. If you decided to nuke your account

120
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,540
and remove all your mods, they wouldn't actually be deleted. The original page of the mods might

121
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,700
say deleted, but any collection pages still referencing those mods would allow users to

122
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,940
download them. This decision prompted a gigantic backlash from the community. So much so that the

123
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,420
Nexus team actually ended up giving the modders a one month grace period to delete their mods from

124
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,660
the site. Originally, there was no grace period at all, but ultimately the change still went forward.

125
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,940
Today, nobody can delete their mods from the site. And if you miss the news and still want to,

126
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,020
you should have luck. While Nexus mods is still the site for modding your games,

127
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,020
their collections functionality is still kind of lackluster. It isn't really used too often.

128
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,180
For example, when people want a collection of mods for Skyrim, they don't use Nexus collections.

129
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,500
They use Wabbajack, named after the staff of the same name from the same game. Wabbajack is an

130
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,420
automated mod installer. It automatically searches Nexus mods as well as other online

131
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,500
mod locations and allows you to build a mod pack just like Nexus collections. But unlike

132
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,900
Nexus collections, Wabbajack actually checks over the files of the mods and uses its knowledge of

133
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,660
Skyrim's own files to determine whether or not the mods are actually compatible with each other.

134
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,420
Anybody can slap random shit into a Nexus collections list, but Wabbajack actually tries

135
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,100
to ensure that everything will work together. It's a neat little application. This is just my

136
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,140
own intuition, but I've been around the block enough that I think I know what happened. It

137
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,980
happened to Jack Conte over at Patreon. Happened to TotalBiscuit too, and my video about it back

138
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,140
in the day went viral. Everybody who has a cool new idea starts out like these guys. They're just

139
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,900
a part of the community like any other user. They build a website or a YouTube show or a business,

140
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,380
not necessarily hoping to become the king of the castle, but because as one of the many users on

141
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,780
the ground, they see a niche and they want to fill it for the sake of everyone. And as they grow more

142
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:33,100
successful and more of their fellow users start using their new innovation, they gradually stop

143
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,500
being a fellow user. Do you think YouTubers become more or less in touch with their viewers the

144
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,740
larger their channels grow? Jack Conte started Patreon with an idea and a passion, but do you

145
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,740
think that's still really there considering his behaviors in the past few years? Robin Scott

146
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,980
started TES Source as a teenage fan of Elder Scrolls. Is he the same person? Obviously not.

147
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,900
And some of that will be the natural process of maturity, but not all of it. People who start as

148
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,260
fans and then suddenly have fans of their own. People who spend most of their formative years

149
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,180
as consumers and then buy a roll of the dice find themselves creators or curators instead.

150
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,700
The attitude they take towards their growth often determines what they grow into down the line.

151
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,020
And there's so many examples. TotalBiscuit and Jack Conte are just a few of people who started

152
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:13,260
a big project, received significant pushback from their fans and ended up lashing out or even

153
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,940
hating them as a result. And while I haven't seen any definitive proof of this happening to Robin

154
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,740
Scott based on how he used to talk versus how he talks now, I have a feeling that it did. He

155
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,060
and his team got royally shit on by the community for the Nexus Collection shit show. They only

156
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,540
begrudgingly offered the one month grace period to allow people to take their mods off the site

157
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,100
and only after a ridiculous amount of backlash. And compared to his 2012 position from that

158
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,300
podcast we listened to or his 2015 position on the openness of the site, his current position

159
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,540
for the past few years has been entirely fuck you if you don't like it, leave. And hey, I can

160
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,500
respect that too. There are actually times where you are correct and your community is incorrect

161
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,940
and you need to stand your ground because you think it's the right thing to do. Popularity or

162
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,620
democracy is not what determines the truth. But all of these people I've been talking about,

163
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,980
they think that this position means you have to go to war with your own audience.

164
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,980
But that's just the ego talking. I know some of you have been listening to the past few minutes

165
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,220
of this video and wondering if and when the side effect of my growth will happen to old Devo. Some

166
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,740
of you act like it already has, simply because I don't acquiesce to your demands all the time. But

167
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:17,100
the golden mean between just say and do whatever your audience says and burn everything down and

168
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,980
make your audience hate you is stand by what you think is right but don't hate your audience for

169
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,540
disagreeing. It's humility. For example, I know how much at least some of you don't like Lilith

170
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,140
or the tubcast. Maybe you don't like some of her takes. And that's okay because I don't agree with

171
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,220
her all the time either. Maybe you just want to be rude because she's trans and I'll never support

172
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,700
that but you do you. Even if I think you're absolutely retarded or you're specifically here

173
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:44,060
just to be a hateful dick, I generally don't ban anybody from my chat unless they're being extremely

174
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,140
disruptive to the show or chasing other chatters or something. If you are one of my viewers who

175
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,620
specifically hates the tubcast or hates Lilith, I can disagree with you without going to war with

176
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,580
you. I won't stop doing what I want to do simply based on your say-so but I also won't think that

177
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:02,140
you're a villain or or not a real fan or something if you disagree with me. I think that's the

178
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,900
difference between me and the examples that I've talked about today. And I think that's where

179
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,700
Robin Scott is now. Again no real proof just a hunch and some of his circumstantial comments.

180
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,340
It's not just his my way or the highway point of view. It's that if you choose highway he thinks

181
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,420
you're a bigot. Not wanting pride flags in Spider-Man is as stupid as wanting them. Ain't it

182
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,740
just a flag? Who cares? Wanting them removed is kind of petty but so is flying them in the first

183
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,860
place. A modder taking pride flags down is no more or less homophobic than what a corporation

184
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,540
does at the end of June. In fact I know you expected this video to be about the flag itself

185
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,940
instead of nexus mods as a site but I'm actually saving that pride flag topic for another time.

186
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,060
In fact maybe we'll even do it tomorrow so uh I'll see you then.
