1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
So there's one thing that the intersectionalists generally have right. There is usually no

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,120
functional difference between an individual who is a member of a traditionally oppressed group

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,160
and an individual who is a member of a traditionally dominant group.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,520
Here's what I mean. The simplified intersectionalist view on race

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,720
has white people as the oppressor class and people of color as the oppressed class. The term

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,280
people of color is itself rather nebulous, considering that Jewish self-identification

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,320
seems to flip-flop between them being whites or POCs depending on what is useful at the moment,

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,960
almost like Jews are a type of Schrodinger's minority. Meanwhile, Asians and Indians often

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,120
outperform whites on several metrics, meaning that it's quite strange for whites to somehow

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,280
be oppressing them. But okay, regardless of the obvious problems with this point of view,

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,880
let's just accept it at face value for the purposes of this conversation.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,640
While there may be biological differences between the races when it comes to, say,

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,320
the prevalence of certain diseases or whatever in terms of human rights,

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,640
of equality of opportunity, of justice and fairness, we can all agree that race should

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,360
play no part. Black people can and should have the same set of rights as white people,

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,760
that's why they're universal human rights. The justice system should be blind to race.

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,960
People should be given the opportunity to get ahead in life on their own merits,

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,720
regardless of their race. It's the same with gender, although that one's a bit shakier because

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,560
the biological differences between men and women are a lot huger than the biological differences

20
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,280
between various racial groups. But nonetheless, the intersectionalists view men as a dominating

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,160
class and women as an oppressed class. Their objection to the state of affairs is rooted in

22
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,960
that same appeal to individualism. In terms of human rights, of equality of opportunity,

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,040
of justice and fairness, gender should play no factor. Women should have the same set of rights

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,640
as men. The justice system should be blind to gender, and individuals should be given

25
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,560
the opportunity to get ahead in life on their own merits. Ultimately, the intersectionalists

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,240
don't want to apply their own standards to every possible fractionated identity,

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,040
either out of laziness or for ideological reasons. Here's why. Say you've got women,

28
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,360
then black women, then black lesbian women, then black trans lesbian women,

29
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,720
then black trans lesbian Muslim women, then black trans lesbian Muslim immigrant women,

30
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,200
and so on and so on. The various identities intersect to create an ever smaller, ever more

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,000
oppressed minority, and each combination of intersections is itself its own minute category.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
However, they don't want every possible identity to be included in this calculation.

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,680
Let's consider an obvious meme, the whole gamers are an oppressed minority thing. Yeah,

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,200
it was purposely created to make fun of intersectionalists, but let's take it

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,280
seriously for a bit. Why can't gamers be considered oppressed? If you're around my age,

36
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,120
that means you were in school when gamers were routinely bullied simply for playing games.

37
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,920
Gamer as an identity is maligned in popular culture and the media as being comprised of

38
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,640
either violent, dangerous, incel terrorists or loser nerd man babies who never left their

39
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,720
parents' basement. I know this is a dumb argument, but it's also the natural end result

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,520
of intersectionalism. Every iota of your personality becomes its own identity, a rallying

41
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,240
point around which your lived experiences may classify you as oppressor or oppressed due to

42
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,160
how it interacts with the larger culture. But this would mean that a whole bunch of identities that

43
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,280
social justice warriors like to vilify, including, but not limited to, gamers and incels, are

44
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,960
actually oppressed according to intersectional theory, so some identities have to be explained

45
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,440
away as simply not counting. But more importantly, when some identities are disqualified from

46
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,840
intersectionality for political reasons, you also avoid addressing the fundamental flaw of

47
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,160
intersectionality. When you fractionate every single tiniest data point of your life as its

48
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,720
own unique identity, everybody ends up as a minority of one. Because nobody's life is exactly

49
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,520
the same. Just because you've got two black disabled trans lesbian Muslim immigrant women

50
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,920
who are victims of abusive alcoholic husbands and have a child with down syndrome, eventually

51
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,600
you're going to come across a point where their lives differ. That difference will create another

52
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,520
identity point around which oppressions and privileges flow, and you ultimately end up with

53
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,760
each human being having their own personal fractionated spot within the intersectional

54
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,280
framework. In other words, the tiniest, most vulnerable, most maligned and oppressed minority

55
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,600
in all of human history is the individual. And individualism gets you to that end point a lot

56
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,920
quicker and a lot less tyrannically than intersectionalism. But because intersectionality

57
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,080
is the natural end point is the individual. Intersectionalists basically refuse to do the

58
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,160
math on their own ideology, and simply check off the most popular minority statuses. It's

59
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,760
why you keep seeing quote unquote badass girls in movies and games nowadays who have the same ugly

60
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,320
face and shaved side head and boring personality. Because if checking a box is all that's required

61
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,960
to write a character nowadays, that's all they're going to do. However, ableism is routinely included

62
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,280
on that list of boxes to tick off. And it's a bit different than all the rest because unlike race or

63
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,400
gender or whatever, disability is, practically speaking, a uniquely negative thing. The innate

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,640
differences between white and black people don't include any difference to their total potential.

65
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,080
The innate differences between men and women also don't include any differences to their

66
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,400
total potential, at least outside of the realm of athletics. If any barriers still existed along

67
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,520
those lines, there's actually an okay chance they might be structural, as the SJWs say.

68
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,040
But a disabled person is a whole different ballgame. The problem isn't structural,

69
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,320
it's in the fact that the innate ability of the person is reduced along some lines.

70
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,160
I mean, yeah, a blind person or a paraplegic might learn to live with their issues,

71
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,840
but if a wizard appeared and offered to restore their bodies to their full functionality,

72
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,560
you don't think they'd take it? Hell, even just to see what it's like?

73
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,520
Disability is routinely shuffled into the intersectional soup,

74
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,880
like it's somehow not radically different. And that's why you see constant memes or

75
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,080
comics or jokes now of trans LGBT wheelchair bound superheroes or soldiers or whatever,

76
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,760
because we all know that mainstream media is happy to tick boxes regardless of how little sense it

77
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,920
makes. And for the most part, the rank and file progressives on the ground eat that shit up in

78
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,400
the name of representation and diversity and inclusion. Except there's one subset of disability

79
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,800
that even the progressives refuse to adopt in their grand crusade for social equalization,

80
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
and their rejection of it throws a much bigger wrench into the problem of intersectionality

81
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,040
than anything I've described so far. And no, it's not being a gamer, though it's pretty close.

82
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,960
It's autism. Here's my theory. The stability of social justice is directly related to the refusal

83
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,120
to shoulder your burdens. The moment when you decide to start personally taking responsibility

84
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,360
is when a lot of progressives will begin to call you problematic or oppressive. This applies to

85
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,920
everybody, not just the autistic, but their uniquely despicable treatment of the autistic

86
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,800
is our window into this discussion. The hashtag you might be ableist if seems to trend locally

87
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,560
for me on twitter like once a month. A lot of the tweets talk about physical disabilities,

88
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,560
a lot of them talk about anxiety, depression, or other disabilities that explicitly affect

89
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,640
your ability to be productive. They're all written from the point of view of somebody who's being

90
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,480
pushed beyond the limits of their disability and how that's oppressive to them specifically

91
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,680
because of that disability. And rarely is autism ever brought up. And if it is, it's generally from

92
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,680
some lonely person getting no traction on the platform on how autism isn't something to be

93
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,840
cured and how they wish people would stop trying because autism is simply a different way of viewing

94
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,240
the world. With the exception of the extreme low functioning cases, that's actually correct.

95
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,640
High functioning autism is certainly less of a disability and more of a radical difference in

96
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,680
personality, and it's this difference that causes social justice types to explicitly leave autism

97
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,440
out of the intersectional equation. When it comes to disabilities that change people's ability to

98
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,000
work, whether they're physical or mental, the intersectionalists are just fine with advocating

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,600
for their liberation from the ableists of the world. But when it's a disability that changes

100
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,920
their behavior, especially if it changes their behavior in such a way that the individuals

101
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,920
afflicted will never be acceptable to social justice standards, suddenly those same disabled

102
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,640
people are thrown under the short bus. Take sweet Anita for example. I know she's not autistic, but

103
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,600
the same mechanism that determines the negative SJW reaction to autism is also at play here.

104
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,080
Sweet Anita has Tourette's syndrome, and a clip of her went viral a few months ago where her Tourette's

105
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,960
forced her to say, kill the Jews live on Twitch. Any reasonable person knew this wasn't her fault,

106
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,240
but believe it or not, the progressive intersectional types on social media were

107
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,680
divided on the topic. Some of them believed that it was ableist for people to want to see

108
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,600
Sweet Anita cancelled. Others believed her disability was no excuse because the things she

109
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,160
said were considered by social justice theory to be objectively evil, even if she doesn't actually

110
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,000
hold those opinions herself. Despite the fact that she's disabled, because it's a disability

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,080
that affects her behavior, there's a strong social justice argument against her, because

112
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,040
social justice ideology is largely interpersonal and performative in nature, and if a person's

113
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,280
disability prevents them from playing along, they're more oppressive than they are oppressed.

114
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,760
It's the same with autism, essentially. Again, because social justice ideology is interpersonal

115
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,000
and performative, it's a game that autistic people can't really play. Let's stake encountering a

116
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,240
trans person as an example. Assume that you're a polite individual who will use a trans person's

117
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,600
preferred pronouns and treat them like the gender of their choice when interacting with them. When

118
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,560
you see a man, a woman, or a trans person that passes well, your social sense kicks in, and you

119
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,000
have a general idea of how to treat the person you're dealing with insofar as their gender is

120
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,920
concerned. But what if you bump into a trans woman who doesn't really pass? Like, it's not that

121
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,440
they're not putting in effort, but just due to their body type or whatever, it's not working,

122
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,760
and you can clearly tell. The polite person would likely treat them as a woman, even if they look

123
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,360
more masculine, because they recognize that at least they're putting the effort in. But the

124
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,080
autistic person doesn't have a social sense that kicks in. They're genuinely perceiving the person

125
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,480
in front of them as a man dressing up as a woman, not out of any kind of bigotry, but because their

126
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,720
autism prevents them from having any of those internal smoothing over processes that would

127
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,560
occur in the polite person's brain. Here's another example of disability running counter to

128
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,800
intersectionality. Why do you think the Joker movie was so widely maligned? It wasn't because

129
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,440
of gamers or incels or impotent male violence or whatever else they wanted to tar and feather it

130
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,160
with. It's because the existence of people like Joaquin Phoenix's Joker character destroy any

131
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,880
high ground the intersectionalists claim they hold, simply by existing. In the movie, the Joker

132
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,280
is an oppressed member of the working class who is assaulted by capitalist fat cats, has his

133
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,240
medication denied due to social program cuts, is abused by his mother, hallucinates repeatedly

134
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,120
throughout the movie, and eventually descends into murderous madness due to factors entirely outside

135
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,920
of his control. He is an intersectionalist poster boy, if not a Marxist one, for the systemic damage

136
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,960
that the white heterosexist capitalist patriarchy inflicts. And yet the movie, the character, and

137
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,080
even the actor himself in real life, was vilified. He was considered the patron saint of incels,

138
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,240
and his movie was going to further radicalize young men. None of these scathing far-left

139
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,720
criticisms of the film ever mentioned the Joker's disability in detail, because if they did,

140
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,200
they'd have to confront the specter of ableism excusing all of his actions as simply punching

141
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,520
up within the intersectionalist framework. In a more general sense, if your disability prevents

142
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,080
you from taking your proper place as a social justice drone within the intersectional framework,

143
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,200
then you're no longer allowed to cry ableism because of it.

144
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Autistic people don't have the ability to pick up on the social cues necessary to make social

145
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,960
justice function. People with Tourette's can't stop themselves from performing in a way that

146
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,840
progressivism finds uniquely and objectively immoral. Abuse victims, depressed people,

147
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,640
people with anxiety, psychopathic or sociopathic people, and many other types of mental disorders,

148
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,880
all include the possibility that somebody might behave in a way that the radical left sees as

149
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,040
oppressive. So the get-out-of-jail-free card that is calling your detractors bigots

150
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,880
has to be revoked from all of them. I'm not saying that the negative behaviors of these

151
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,800
people should be blanket ignored because of their mental health. Far from it. In the end,

152
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,240
what they do is still their responsibility. But the general, apolitical, unideological public

153
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,880
tends to view those people who suffer while still not relinquishing that responsibility as heroes.

154
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,200
The Joker is a tragic villain, but he's still the villain, not because of his condition,

155
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,400
but because of the violence he chooses to cause at the end of the movie. Meanwhile,

156
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,200
when sweet Anita says terrible things on stream, she routinely apologizes or makes jokes out of it

157
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,280
rather than cursing fate. She doesn't start blaming Twitch or her audience or her condition

158
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,160
or her parents or whatever. She lifts her burdens properly. And maybe that's the key to all this.

159
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,840
We already know that the natural conclusion to intersectionality is people playing Oppression

160
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,000
Olympics, pulling the victim card, getting offended at everything, and doing whatever it is

161
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,240
they can to avoid lifting their burdens properly. But that specific subset of disabilities that the

162
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,120
SJWs reject are disabilities where living with them properly can only be done by lifting their

163
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,600
burdens properly. Maybe it is that seeing sweet Anita be humble rather than triggered,

164
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,920
seeing an incel self-improve rather than descend into hatred, seeing an autistic person speak

165
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,400
freely rather than self-censor are all revolutionary acts against intersectionality itself.

166
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,920
It would seem to be the case. Intersectionalists react very similarly when Blair White says tranny

167
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,480
or when Kanye West says he wants a white guy to play him in a biopic. If social justice is a

168
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,480
performative act, then the radical leftists will always attack those people who refuse to play

169
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,880
their roles. However, when it's a disability that prevents people from playing their roles,

170
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,200
the mask slips. They show that they don't actually care about ableism. It's just a tool for them to

171
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,360
gain power. And they end up acting like the biggest ableists out there in their attempts

172
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,440
to force their ideology. It seems to be the same way for racism and sexism too. You know,

173
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,200
nobody thinks that a person is racist for telling a racist joke, but the progressive who gets

174
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,360
offended is a racist because they actually think the contents of the joke are true rather than

175
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,600
simply said for shock value. And they've got a guilty conscience about their own feelings on it.

176
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,600
It would seem to me that intersectionality is a structure set up by bigots of the highest order,

177
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,360
solely because they feel guilty about their own bigotry, and they have this overwhelming need

178
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,440
to restructure the entirety of society in order to repent. It doesn't matter to them how much more

179
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,600
bigoted they have to act to reach the end goal, because once they reach it, it is written that

180
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,280
bigotry will disappear from the collective human conscience. It's kind of like how communists will

181
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,880
kill millions of people to reach the ideal communist paradise where suffering disappears.

182
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,080
It's the same damn thing. So regardless of who you are, regardless of your race, or your sex,

183
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,200
or your gender, or your trans status, or your disability, or anything else, do you want to

184
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:09,680
destroy intersectionality? It's easy. Be a responsible person. Be humble. Lift your burdens.

185
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,680
And the thing will die on its own.
