00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
So there's one thing that the intersectionalists generally have right. There is usually no

00:05.200 --> 00:09.120
functional difference between an individual who is a member of a traditionally oppressed group

00:09.120 --> 00:12.160
and an individual who is a member of a traditionally dominant group.

00:12.160 --> 00:15.520
Here's what I mean. The simplified intersectionalist view on race

00:15.520 --> 00:20.720
has white people as the oppressor class and people of color as the oppressed class. The term

00:20.720 --> 00:25.280
people of color is itself rather nebulous, considering that Jewish self-identification

00:25.280 --> 00:30.320
seems to flip-flop between them being whites or POCs depending on what is useful at the moment,

00:30.320 --> 00:34.960
almost like Jews are a type of Schrodinger's minority. Meanwhile, Asians and Indians often

00:34.960 --> 00:39.120
outperform whites on several metrics, meaning that it's quite strange for whites to somehow

00:39.120 --> 00:43.280
be oppressing them. But okay, regardless of the obvious problems with this point of view,

00:43.280 --> 00:46.880
let's just accept it at face value for the purposes of this conversation.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.640
While there may be biological differences between the races when it comes to, say,

00:50.640 --> 00:54.320
the prevalence of certain diseases or whatever in terms of human rights,

00:54.320 --> 00:58.640
of equality of opportunity, of justice and fairness, we can all agree that race should

00:58.640 --> 01:03.360
play no part. Black people can and should have the same set of rights as white people,

01:03.360 --> 01:07.760
that's why they're universal human rights. The justice system should be blind to race.

01:07.760 --> 01:10.960
People should be given the opportunity to get ahead in life on their own merits,

01:10.960 --> 01:14.720
regardless of their race. It's the same with gender, although that one's a bit shakier because

01:14.720 --> 01:18.560
the biological differences between men and women are a lot huger than the biological differences

01:18.560 --> 01:23.280
between various racial groups. But nonetheless, the intersectionalists view men as a dominating

01:23.280 --> 01:28.160
class and women as an oppressed class. Their objection to the state of affairs is rooted in

01:28.160 --> 01:32.960
that same appeal to individualism. In terms of human rights, of equality of opportunity,

01:32.960 --> 01:37.040
of justice and fairness, gender should play no factor. Women should have the same set of rights

01:37.040 --> 01:40.640
as men. The justice system should be blind to gender, and individuals should be given

01:40.640 --> 01:44.560
the opportunity to get ahead in life on their own merits. Ultimately, the intersectionalists

01:44.560 --> 01:48.240
don't want to apply their own standards to every possible fractionated identity,

01:48.240 --> 01:53.040
either out of laziness or for ideological reasons. Here's why. Say you've got women,

01:53.040 --> 01:57.360
then black women, then black lesbian women, then black trans lesbian women,

01:57.360 --> 02:02.720
then black trans lesbian Muslim women, then black trans lesbian Muslim immigrant women,

02:02.720 --> 02:07.200
and so on and so on. The various identities intersect to create an ever smaller, ever more

02:07.200 --> 02:12.000
oppressed minority, and each combination of intersections is itself its own minute category.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.360
However, they don't want every possible identity to be included in this calculation.

02:15.360 --> 02:19.680
Let's consider an obvious meme, the whole gamers are an oppressed minority thing. Yeah,

02:19.680 --> 02:23.200
it was purposely created to make fun of intersectionalists, but let's take it

02:23.200 --> 02:27.280
seriously for a bit. Why can't gamers be considered oppressed? If you're around my age,

02:27.280 --> 02:31.120
that means you were in school when gamers were routinely bullied simply for playing games.

02:31.120 --> 02:35.920
Gamer as an identity is maligned in popular culture and the media as being comprised of

02:35.920 --> 02:40.640
either violent, dangerous, incel terrorists or loser nerd man babies who never left their

02:40.640 --> 02:44.720
parents' basement. I know this is a dumb argument, but it's also the natural end result

02:44.720 --> 02:49.520
of intersectionalism. Every iota of your personality becomes its own identity, a rallying

02:49.520 --> 02:54.240
point around which your lived experiences may classify you as oppressor or oppressed due to

02:54.240 --> 02:58.160
how it interacts with the larger culture. But this would mean that a whole bunch of identities that

02:58.160 --> 03:03.280
social justice warriors like to vilify, including, but not limited to, gamers and incels, are

03:03.280 --> 03:06.960
actually oppressed according to intersectional theory, so some identities have to be explained

03:06.960 --> 03:11.440
away as simply not counting. But more importantly, when some identities are disqualified from

03:11.440 --> 03:15.840
intersectionality for political reasons, you also avoid addressing the fundamental flaw of

03:15.840 --> 03:20.160
intersectionality. When you fractionate every single tiniest data point of your life as its

03:20.160 --> 03:24.720
own unique identity, everybody ends up as a minority of one. Because nobody's life is exactly

03:24.720 --> 03:29.520
the same. Just because you've got two black disabled trans lesbian Muslim immigrant women

03:29.520 --> 03:33.920
who are victims of abusive alcoholic husbands and have a child with down syndrome, eventually

03:33.920 --> 03:37.600
you're going to come across a point where their lives differ. That difference will create another

03:37.600 --> 03:41.520
identity point around which oppressions and privileges flow, and you ultimately end up with

03:41.520 --> 03:45.760
each human being having their own personal fractionated spot within the intersectional

03:45.760 --> 03:51.280
framework. In other words, the tiniest, most vulnerable, most maligned and oppressed minority

03:51.280 --> 03:55.600
in all of human history is the individual. And individualism gets you to that end point a lot

03:55.600 --> 03:59.920
quicker and a lot less tyrannically than intersectionalism. But because intersectionality

03:59.920 --> 04:04.080
is the natural end point is the individual. Intersectionalists basically refuse to do the

04:04.080 --> 04:08.160
math on their own ideology, and simply check off the most popular minority statuses. It's

04:08.160 --> 04:13.760
why you keep seeing quote unquote badass girls in movies and games nowadays who have the same ugly

04:13.760 --> 04:18.320
face and shaved side head and boring personality. Because if checking a box is all that's required

04:18.320 --> 04:22.960
to write a character nowadays, that's all they're going to do. However, ableism is routinely included

04:22.960 --> 04:27.280
on that list of boxes to tick off. And it's a bit different than all the rest because unlike race or

04:27.280 --> 04:32.400
gender or whatever, disability is, practically speaking, a uniquely negative thing. The innate

04:32.400 --> 04:36.640
differences between white and black people don't include any difference to their total potential.

04:36.640 --> 04:40.080
The innate differences between men and women also don't include any differences to their

04:40.080 --> 04:44.400
total potential, at least outside of the realm of athletics. If any barriers still existed along

04:44.400 --> 04:49.520
those lines, there's actually an okay chance they might be structural, as the SJWs say.

04:49.520 --> 04:53.040
But a disabled person is a whole different ballgame. The problem isn't structural,

04:53.040 --> 04:56.320
it's in the fact that the innate ability of the person is reduced along some lines.

04:56.320 --> 05:00.160
I mean, yeah, a blind person or a paraplegic might learn to live with their issues,

05:00.160 --> 05:03.840
but if a wizard appeared and offered to restore their bodies to their full functionality,

05:03.840 --> 05:06.560
you don't think they'd take it? Hell, even just to see what it's like?

05:06.560 --> 05:09.520
Disability is routinely shuffled into the intersectional soup,

05:09.520 --> 05:12.880
like it's somehow not radically different. And that's why you see constant memes or

05:12.880 --> 05:18.080
comics or jokes now of trans LGBT wheelchair bound superheroes or soldiers or whatever,

05:18.080 --> 05:21.760
because we all know that mainstream media is happy to tick boxes regardless of how little sense it

05:21.760 --> 05:25.920
makes. And for the most part, the rank and file progressives on the ground eat that shit up in

05:25.920 --> 05:30.400
the name of representation and diversity and inclusion. Except there's one subset of disability

05:30.400 --> 05:34.800
that even the progressives refuse to adopt in their grand crusade for social equalization,

05:34.800 --> 05:38.800
and their rejection of it throws a much bigger wrench into the problem of intersectionality

05:38.800 --> 05:43.040
than anything I've described so far. And no, it's not being a gamer, though it's pretty close.

05:43.760 --> 05:48.960
It's autism. Here's my theory. The stability of social justice is directly related to the refusal

05:48.960 --> 05:53.120
to shoulder your burdens. The moment when you decide to start personally taking responsibility

05:53.120 --> 05:57.360
is when a lot of progressives will begin to call you problematic or oppressive. This applies to

05:57.360 --> 06:01.920
everybody, not just the autistic, but their uniquely despicable treatment of the autistic

06:01.920 --> 06:06.800
is our window into this discussion. The hashtag you might be ableist if seems to trend locally

06:06.800 --> 06:10.560
for me on twitter like once a month. A lot of the tweets talk about physical disabilities,

06:10.560 --> 06:14.560
a lot of them talk about anxiety, depression, or other disabilities that explicitly affect

06:14.560 --> 06:18.640
your ability to be productive. They're all written from the point of view of somebody who's being

06:18.640 --> 06:22.480
pushed beyond the limits of their disability and how that's oppressive to them specifically

06:22.480 --> 06:27.680
because of that disability. And rarely is autism ever brought up. And if it is, it's generally from

06:27.680 --> 06:31.680
some lonely person getting no traction on the platform on how autism isn't something to be

06:31.680 --> 06:35.840
cured and how they wish people would stop trying because autism is simply a different way of viewing

06:35.840 --> 06:40.240
the world. With the exception of the extreme low functioning cases, that's actually correct.

06:40.240 --> 06:44.640
High functioning autism is certainly less of a disability and more of a radical difference in

06:44.640 --> 06:49.680
personality, and it's this difference that causes social justice types to explicitly leave autism

06:49.680 --> 06:53.440
out of the intersectional equation. When it comes to disabilities that change people's ability to

06:53.440 --> 06:58.000
work, whether they're physical or mental, the intersectionalists are just fine with advocating

06:58.000 --> 07:01.600
for their liberation from the ableists of the world. But when it's a disability that changes

07:01.600 --> 07:05.920
their behavior, especially if it changes their behavior in such a way that the individuals

07:05.920 --> 07:09.920
afflicted will never be acceptable to social justice standards, suddenly those same disabled

07:09.920 --> 07:14.640
people are thrown under the short bus. Take sweet Anita for example. I know she's not autistic, but

07:14.640 --> 07:19.600
the same mechanism that determines the negative SJW reaction to autism is also at play here.

07:19.600 --> 07:24.080
Sweet Anita has Tourette's syndrome, and a clip of her went viral a few months ago where her Tourette's

07:24.080 --> 07:28.960
forced her to say, kill the Jews live on Twitch. Any reasonable person knew this wasn't her fault,

07:28.960 --> 07:32.240
but believe it or not, the progressive intersectional types on social media were

07:32.240 --> 07:35.680
divided on the topic. Some of them believed that it was ableist for people to want to see

07:35.680 --> 07:39.600
Sweet Anita cancelled. Others believed her disability was no excuse because the things she

07:39.600 --> 07:44.160
said were considered by social justice theory to be objectively evil, even if she doesn't actually

07:44.160 --> 07:48.000
hold those opinions herself. Despite the fact that she's disabled, because it's a disability

07:48.000 --> 07:52.080
that affects her behavior, there's a strong social justice argument against her, because

07:52.080 --> 07:57.040
social justice ideology is largely interpersonal and performative in nature, and if a person's

07:57.040 --> 08:01.280
disability prevents them from playing along, they're more oppressive than they are oppressed.

08:01.280 --> 08:05.760
It's the same with autism, essentially. Again, because social justice ideology is interpersonal

08:05.760 --> 08:10.000
and performative, it's a game that autistic people can't really play. Let's stake encountering a

08:10.000 --> 08:14.240
trans person as an example. Assume that you're a polite individual who will use a trans person's

08:14.240 --> 08:17.600
preferred pronouns and treat them like the gender of their choice when interacting with them. When

08:17.600 --> 08:22.560
you see a man, a woman, or a trans person that passes well, your social sense kicks in, and you

08:22.560 --> 08:26.000
have a general idea of how to treat the person you're dealing with insofar as their gender is

08:26.000 --> 08:29.920
concerned. But what if you bump into a trans woman who doesn't really pass? Like, it's not that

08:29.920 --> 08:33.440
they're not putting in effort, but just due to their body type or whatever, it's not working,

08:33.440 --> 08:37.760
and you can clearly tell. The polite person would likely treat them as a woman, even if they look

08:37.760 --> 08:41.360
more masculine, because they recognize that at least they're putting the effort in. But the

08:41.360 --> 08:46.080
autistic person doesn't have a social sense that kicks in. They're genuinely perceiving the person

08:46.080 --> 08:50.480
in front of them as a man dressing up as a woman, not out of any kind of bigotry, but because their

08:50.480 --> 08:54.720
autism prevents them from having any of those internal smoothing over processes that would

08:54.720 --> 08:58.560
occur in the polite person's brain. Here's another example of disability running counter to

08:58.560 --> 09:02.800
intersectionality. Why do you think the Joker movie was so widely maligned? It wasn't because

09:02.800 --> 09:07.440
of gamers or incels or impotent male violence or whatever else they wanted to tar and feather it

09:07.440 --> 09:12.160
with. It's because the existence of people like Joaquin Phoenix's Joker character destroy any

09:12.160 --> 09:16.880
high ground the intersectionalists claim they hold, simply by existing. In the movie, the Joker

09:16.880 --> 09:21.280
is an oppressed member of the working class who is assaulted by capitalist fat cats, has his

09:21.280 --> 09:26.240
medication denied due to social program cuts, is abused by his mother, hallucinates repeatedly

09:26.240 --> 09:31.120
throughout the movie, and eventually descends into murderous madness due to factors entirely outside

09:31.120 --> 09:35.920
of his control. He is an intersectionalist poster boy, if not a Marxist one, for the systemic damage

09:35.920 --> 09:40.960
that the white heterosexist capitalist patriarchy inflicts. And yet the movie, the character, and

09:40.960 --> 09:46.080
even the actor himself in real life, was vilified. He was considered the patron saint of incels,

09:46.080 --> 09:50.240
and his movie was going to further radicalize young men. None of these scathing far-left

09:50.240 --> 09:54.720
criticisms of the film ever mentioned the Joker's disability in detail, because if they did,

09:54.720 --> 09:59.200
they'd have to confront the specter of ableism excusing all of his actions as simply punching

09:59.200 --> 10:03.520
up within the intersectionalist framework. In a more general sense, if your disability prevents

10:03.520 --> 10:08.080
you from taking your proper place as a social justice drone within the intersectional framework,

10:08.080 --> 10:11.200
then you're no longer allowed to cry ableism because of it.

10:11.200 --> 10:15.200
Autistic people don't have the ability to pick up on the social cues necessary to make social

10:15.200 --> 10:18.960
justice function. People with Tourette's can't stop themselves from performing in a way that

10:18.960 --> 10:23.840
progressivism finds uniquely and objectively immoral. Abuse victims, depressed people,

10:23.840 --> 10:28.640
people with anxiety, psychopathic or sociopathic people, and many other types of mental disorders,

10:28.640 --> 10:32.880
all include the possibility that somebody might behave in a way that the radical left sees as

10:32.880 --> 10:37.040
oppressive. So the get-out-of-jail-free card that is calling your detractors bigots

10:37.040 --> 10:40.880
has to be revoked from all of them. I'm not saying that the negative behaviors of these

10:40.880 --> 10:44.800
people should be blanket ignored because of their mental health. Far from it. In the end,

10:44.800 --> 10:50.240
what they do is still their responsibility. But the general, apolitical, unideological public

10:50.240 --> 10:54.880
tends to view those people who suffer while still not relinquishing that responsibility as heroes.

10:54.880 --> 10:59.200
The Joker is a tragic villain, but he's still the villain, not because of his condition,

10:59.200 --> 11:02.400
but because of the violence he chooses to cause at the end of the movie. Meanwhile,

11:02.400 --> 11:07.200
when sweet Anita says terrible things on stream, she routinely apologizes or makes jokes out of it

11:07.200 --> 11:11.280
rather than cursing fate. She doesn't start blaming Twitch or her audience or her condition

11:11.280 --> 11:16.160
or her parents or whatever. She lifts her burdens properly. And maybe that's the key to all this.

11:16.160 --> 11:19.840
We already know that the natural conclusion to intersectionality is people playing Oppression

11:19.840 --> 11:24.000
Olympics, pulling the victim card, getting offended at everything, and doing whatever it is

11:24.000 --> 11:28.240
they can to avoid lifting their burdens properly. But that specific subset of disabilities that the

11:28.240 --> 11:33.120
SJWs reject are disabilities where living with them properly can only be done by lifting their

11:33.120 --> 11:37.600
burdens properly. Maybe it is that seeing sweet Anita be humble rather than triggered,

11:37.600 --> 11:41.920
seeing an incel self-improve rather than descend into hatred, seeing an autistic person speak

11:41.920 --> 11:46.400
freely rather than self-censor are all revolutionary acts against intersectionality itself.

11:46.400 --> 11:51.920
It would seem to be the case. Intersectionalists react very similarly when Blair White says tranny

11:51.920 --> 11:56.480
or when Kanye West says he wants a white guy to play him in a biopic. If social justice is a

11:56.480 --> 12:00.480
performative act, then the radical leftists will always attack those people who refuse to play

12:00.480 --> 12:04.880
their roles. However, when it's a disability that prevents people from playing their roles,

12:04.880 --> 12:09.200
the mask slips. They show that they don't actually care about ableism. It's just a tool for them to

12:09.200 --> 12:13.360
gain power. And they end up acting like the biggest ableists out there in their attempts

12:13.360 --> 12:17.440
to force their ideology. It seems to be the same way for racism and sexism too. You know,

12:17.440 --> 12:21.200
nobody thinks that a person is racist for telling a racist joke, but the progressive who gets

12:21.200 --> 12:25.360
offended is a racist because they actually think the contents of the joke are true rather than

12:25.360 --> 12:29.600
simply said for shock value. And they've got a guilty conscience about their own feelings on it.

12:29.600 --> 12:33.600
It would seem to me that intersectionality is a structure set up by bigots of the highest order,

12:33.600 --> 12:37.360
solely because they feel guilty about their own bigotry, and they have this overwhelming need

12:37.360 --> 12:41.440
to restructure the entirety of society in order to repent. It doesn't matter to them how much more

12:41.440 --> 12:45.600
bigoted they have to act to reach the end goal, because once they reach it, it is written that

12:45.600 --> 12:49.280
bigotry will disappear from the collective human conscience. It's kind of like how communists will

12:49.280 --> 12:52.880
kill millions of people to reach the ideal communist paradise where suffering disappears.

12:52.880 --> 12:58.080
It's the same damn thing. So regardless of who you are, regardless of your race, or your sex,

12:58.080 --> 13:03.200
or your gender, or your trans status, or your disability, or anything else, do you want to

13:03.200 --> 13:09.680
destroy intersectionality? It's easy. Be a responsible person. Be humble. Lift your burdens.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.680
And the thing will die on its own.
