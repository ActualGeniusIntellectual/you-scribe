0	5200	So there's one thing that the intersectionalists generally have right. There is usually no
5200	9120	functional difference between an individual who is a member of a traditionally oppressed group
9120	12160	and an individual who is a member of a traditionally dominant group.
12160	15520	Here's what I mean. The simplified intersectionalist view on race
15520	20720	has white people as the oppressor class and people of color as the oppressed class. The term
20720	25280	people of color is itself rather nebulous, considering that Jewish self-identification
25280	30320	seems to flip-flop between them being whites or POCs depending on what is useful at the moment,
30320	34960	almost like Jews are a type of Schrodinger's minority. Meanwhile, Asians and Indians often
34960	39120	outperform whites on several metrics, meaning that it's quite strange for whites to somehow
39120	43280	be oppressing them. But okay, regardless of the obvious problems with this point of view,
43280	46880	let's just accept it at face value for the purposes of this conversation.
46880	50640	While there may be biological differences between the races when it comes to, say,
50640	54320	the prevalence of certain diseases or whatever in terms of human rights,
54320	58640	of equality of opportunity, of justice and fairness, we can all agree that race should
58640	63360	play no part. Black people can and should have the same set of rights as white people,
63360	67760	that's why they're universal human rights. The justice system should be blind to race.
67760	70960	People should be given the opportunity to get ahead in life on their own merits,
70960	74720	regardless of their race. It's the same with gender, although that one's a bit shakier because
74720	78560	the biological differences between men and women are a lot huger than the biological differences
78560	83280	between various racial groups. But nonetheless, the intersectionalists view men as a dominating
83280	88160	class and women as an oppressed class. Their objection to the state of affairs is rooted in
88160	92960	that same appeal to individualism. In terms of human rights, of equality of opportunity,
92960	97040	of justice and fairness, gender should play no factor. Women should have the same set of rights
97040	100640	as men. The justice system should be blind to gender, and individuals should be given
100640	104560	the opportunity to get ahead in life on their own merits. Ultimately, the intersectionalists
104560	108240	don't want to apply their own standards to every possible fractionated identity,
108240	113040	either out of laziness or for ideological reasons. Here's why. Say you've got women,
113040	117360	then black women, then black lesbian women, then black trans lesbian women,
117360	122720	then black trans lesbian Muslim women, then black trans lesbian Muslim immigrant women,
122720	127200	and so on and so on. The various identities intersect to create an ever smaller, ever more
127200	132000	oppressed minority, and each combination of intersections is itself its own minute category.
132000	135360	However, they don't want every possible identity to be included in this calculation.
135360	139680	Let's consider an obvious meme, the whole gamers are an oppressed minority thing. Yeah,
139680	143200	it was purposely created to make fun of intersectionalists, but let's take it
143200	147280	seriously for a bit. Why can't gamers be considered oppressed? If you're around my age,
147280	151120	that means you were in school when gamers were routinely bullied simply for playing games.
151120	155920	Gamer as an identity is maligned in popular culture and the media as being comprised of
155920	160640	either violent, dangerous, incel terrorists or loser nerd man babies who never left their
160640	164720	parents' basement. I know this is a dumb argument, but it's also the natural end result
164720	169520	of intersectionalism. Every iota of your personality becomes its own identity, a rallying
169520	174240	point around which your lived experiences may classify you as oppressor or oppressed due to
174240	178160	how it interacts with the larger culture. But this would mean that a whole bunch of identities that
178160	183280	social justice warriors like to vilify, including, but not limited to, gamers and incels, are
183280	186960	actually oppressed according to intersectional theory, so some identities have to be explained
186960	191440	away as simply not counting. But more importantly, when some identities are disqualified from
191440	195840	intersectionality for political reasons, you also avoid addressing the fundamental flaw of
195840	200160	intersectionality. When you fractionate every single tiniest data point of your life as its
200160	204720	own unique identity, everybody ends up as a minority of one. Because nobody's life is exactly
204720	209520	the same. Just because you've got two black disabled trans lesbian Muslim immigrant women
209520	213920	who are victims of abusive alcoholic husbands and have a child with down syndrome, eventually
213920	217600	you're going to come across a point where their lives differ. That difference will create another
217600	221520	identity point around which oppressions and privileges flow, and you ultimately end up with
221520	225760	each human being having their own personal fractionated spot within the intersectional
225760	231280	framework. In other words, the tiniest, most vulnerable, most maligned and oppressed minority
231280	235600	in all of human history is the individual. And individualism gets you to that end point a lot
235600	239920	quicker and a lot less tyrannically than intersectionalism. But because intersectionality
239920	244080	is the natural end point is the individual. Intersectionalists basically refuse to do the
244080	248160	math on their own ideology, and simply check off the most popular minority statuses. It's
248160	253760	why you keep seeing quote unquote badass girls in movies and games nowadays who have the same ugly
253760	258320	face and shaved side head and boring personality. Because if checking a box is all that's required
258320	262960	to write a character nowadays, that's all they're going to do. However, ableism is routinely included
262960	267280	on that list of boxes to tick off. And it's a bit different than all the rest because unlike race or
267280	272400	gender or whatever, disability is, practically speaking, a uniquely negative thing. The innate
272400	276640	differences between white and black people don't include any difference to their total potential.
276640	280080	The innate differences between men and women also don't include any differences to their
280080	284400	total potential, at least outside of the realm of athletics. If any barriers still existed along
284400	289520	those lines, there's actually an okay chance they might be structural, as the SJWs say.
289520	293040	But a disabled person is a whole different ballgame. The problem isn't structural,
293040	296320	it's in the fact that the innate ability of the person is reduced along some lines.
296320	300160	I mean, yeah, a blind person or a paraplegic might learn to live with their issues,
300160	303840	but if a wizard appeared and offered to restore their bodies to their full functionality,
303840	306560	you don't think they'd take it? Hell, even just to see what it's like?
306560	309520	Disability is routinely shuffled into the intersectional soup,
309520	312880	like it's somehow not radically different. And that's why you see constant memes or
312880	318080	comics or jokes now of trans LGBT wheelchair bound superheroes or soldiers or whatever,
318080	321760	because we all know that mainstream media is happy to tick boxes regardless of how little sense it
321760	325920	makes. And for the most part, the rank and file progressives on the ground eat that shit up in
325920	330400	the name of representation and diversity and inclusion. Except there's one subset of disability
330400	334800	that even the progressives refuse to adopt in their grand crusade for social equalization,
334800	338800	and their rejection of it throws a much bigger wrench into the problem of intersectionality
338800	343040	than anything I've described so far. And no, it's not being a gamer, though it's pretty close.
343760	348960	It's autism. Here's my theory. The stability of social justice is directly related to the refusal
348960	353120	to shoulder your burdens. The moment when you decide to start personally taking responsibility
353120	357360	is when a lot of progressives will begin to call you problematic or oppressive. This applies to
357360	361920	everybody, not just the autistic, but their uniquely despicable treatment of the autistic
361920	366800	is our window into this discussion. The hashtag you might be ableist if seems to trend locally
366800	370560	for me on twitter like once a month. A lot of the tweets talk about physical disabilities,
370560	374560	a lot of them talk about anxiety, depression, or other disabilities that explicitly affect
374560	378640	your ability to be productive. They're all written from the point of view of somebody who's being
378640	382480	pushed beyond the limits of their disability and how that's oppressive to them specifically
382480	387680	because of that disability. And rarely is autism ever brought up. And if it is, it's generally from
387680	391680	some lonely person getting no traction on the platform on how autism isn't something to be
391680	395840	cured and how they wish people would stop trying because autism is simply a different way of viewing
395840	400240	the world. With the exception of the extreme low functioning cases, that's actually correct.
400240	404640	High functioning autism is certainly less of a disability and more of a radical difference in
404640	409680	personality, and it's this difference that causes social justice types to explicitly leave autism
409680	413440	out of the intersectional equation. When it comes to disabilities that change people's ability to
413440	418000	work, whether they're physical or mental, the intersectionalists are just fine with advocating
418000	421600	for their liberation from the ableists of the world. But when it's a disability that changes
421600	425920	their behavior, especially if it changes their behavior in such a way that the individuals
425920	429920	afflicted will never be acceptable to social justice standards, suddenly those same disabled
429920	434640	people are thrown under the short bus. Take sweet Anita for example. I know she's not autistic, but
434640	439600	the same mechanism that determines the negative SJW reaction to autism is also at play here.
439600	444080	Sweet Anita has Tourette's syndrome, and a clip of her went viral a few months ago where her Tourette's
444080	448960	forced her to say, kill the Jews live on Twitch. Any reasonable person knew this wasn't her fault,
448960	452240	but believe it or not, the progressive intersectional types on social media were
452240	455680	divided on the topic. Some of them believed that it was ableist for people to want to see
455680	459600	Sweet Anita cancelled. Others believed her disability was no excuse because the things she
459600	464160	said were considered by social justice theory to be objectively evil, even if she doesn't actually
464160	468000	hold those opinions herself. Despite the fact that she's disabled, because it's a disability
468000	472080	that affects her behavior, there's a strong social justice argument against her, because
472080	477040	social justice ideology is largely interpersonal and performative in nature, and if a person's
477040	481280	disability prevents them from playing along, they're more oppressive than they are oppressed.
481280	485760	It's the same with autism, essentially. Again, because social justice ideology is interpersonal
485760	490000	and performative, it's a game that autistic people can't really play. Let's stake encountering a
490000	494240	trans person as an example. Assume that you're a polite individual who will use a trans person's
494240	497600	preferred pronouns and treat them like the gender of their choice when interacting with them. When
497600	502560	you see a man, a woman, or a trans person that passes well, your social sense kicks in, and you
502560	506000	have a general idea of how to treat the person you're dealing with insofar as their gender is
506000	509920	concerned. But what if you bump into a trans woman who doesn't really pass? Like, it's not that
509920	513440	they're not putting in effort, but just due to their body type or whatever, it's not working,
513440	517760	and you can clearly tell. The polite person would likely treat them as a woman, even if they look
517760	521360	more masculine, because they recognize that at least they're putting the effort in. But the
521360	526080	autistic person doesn't have a social sense that kicks in. They're genuinely perceiving the person
526080	530480	in front of them as a man dressing up as a woman, not out of any kind of bigotry, but because their
530480	534720	autism prevents them from having any of those internal smoothing over processes that would
534720	538560	occur in the polite person's brain. Here's another example of disability running counter to
538560	542800	intersectionality. Why do you think the Joker movie was so widely maligned? It wasn't because
542800	547440	of gamers or incels or impotent male violence or whatever else they wanted to tar and feather it
547440	552160	with. It's because the existence of people like Joaquin Phoenix's Joker character destroy any
552160	556880	high ground the intersectionalists claim they hold, simply by existing. In the movie, the Joker
556880	561280	is an oppressed member of the working class who is assaulted by capitalist fat cats, has his
561280	566240	medication denied due to social program cuts, is abused by his mother, hallucinates repeatedly
566240	571120	throughout the movie, and eventually descends into murderous madness due to factors entirely outside
571120	575920	of his control. He is an intersectionalist poster boy, if not a Marxist one, for the systemic damage
575920	580960	that the white heterosexist capitalist patriarchy inflicts. And yet the movie, the character, and
580960	586080	even the actor himself in real life, was vilified. He was considered the patron saint of incels,
586080	590240	and his movie was going to further radicalize young men. None of these scathing far-left
590240	594720	criticisms of the film ever mentioned the Joker's disability in detail, because if they did,
594720	599200	they'd have to confront the specter of ableism excusing all of his actions as simply punching
599200	603520	up within the intersectionalist framework. In a more general sense, if your disability prevents
603520	608080	you from taking your proper place as a social justice drone within the intersectional framework,
608080	611200	then you're no longer allowed to cry ableism because of it.
611200	615200	Autistic people don't have the ability to pick up on the social cues necessary to make social
615200	618960	justice function. People with Tourette's can't stop themselves from performing in a way that
618960	623840	progressivism finds uniquely and objectively immoral. Abuse victims, depressed people,
623840	628640	people with anxiety, psychopathic or sociopathic people, and many other types of mental disorders,
628640	632880	all include the possibility that somebody might behave in a way that the radical left sees as
632880	637040	oppressive. So the get-out-of-jail-free card that is calling your detractors bigots
637040	640880	has to be revoked from all of them. I'm not saying that the negative behaviors of these
640880	644800	people should be blanket ignored because of their mental health. Far from it. In the end,
644800	650240	what they do is still their responsibility. But the general, apolitical, unideological public
650240	654880	tends to view those people who suffer while still not relinquishing that responsibility as heroes.
654880	659200	The Joker is a tragic villain, but he's still the villain, not because of his condition,
659200	662400	but because of the violence he chooses to cause at the end of the movie. Meanwhile,
662400	667200	when sweet Anita says terrible things on stream, she routinely apologizes or makes jokes out of it
667200	671280	rather than cursing fate. She doesn't start blaming Twitch or her audience or her condition
671280	676160	or her parents or whatever. She lifts her burdens properly. And maybe that's the key to all this.
676160	679840	We already know that the natural conclusion to intersectionality is people playing Oppression
679840	684000	Olympics, pulling the victim card, getting offended at everything, and doing whatever it is
684000	688240	they can to avoid lifting their burdens properly. But that specific subset of disabilities that the
688240	693120	SJWs reject are disabilities where living with them properly can only be done by lifting their
693120	697600	burdens properly. Maybe it is that seeing sweet Anita be humble rather than triggered,
697600	701920	seeing an incel self-improve rather than descend into hatred, seeing an autistic person speak
701920	706400	freely rather than self-censor are all revolutionary acts against intersectionality itself.
706400	711920	It would seem to be the case. Intersectionalists react very similarly when Blair White says tranny
711920	716480	or when Kanye West says he wants a white guy to play him in a biopic. If social justice is a
716480	720480	performative act, then the radical leftists will always attack those people who refuse to play
720480	724880	their roles. However, when it's a disability that prevents people from playing their roles,
724880	729200	the mask slips. They show that they don't actually care about ableism. It's just a tool for them to
729200	733360	gain power. And they end up acting like the biggest ableists out there in their attempts
733360	737440	to force their ideology. It seems to be the same way for racism and sexism too. You know,
737440	741200	nobody thinks that a person is racist for telling a racist joke, but the progressive who gets
741200	745360	offended is a racist because they actually think the contents of the joke are true rather than
745360	749600	simply said for shock value. And they've got a guilty conscience about their own feelings on it.
749600	753600	It would seem to me that intersectionality is a structure set up by bigots of the highest order,
753600	757360	solely because they feel guilty about their own bigotry, and they have this overwhelming need
757360	761440	to restructure the entirety of society in order to repent. It doesn't matter to them how much more
761440	765600	bigoted they have to act to reach the end goal, because once they reach it, it is written that
765600	769280	bigotry will disappear from the collective human conscience. It's kind of like how communists will
769280	772880	kill millions of people to reach the ideal communist paradise where suffering disappears.
772880	778080	It's the same damn thing. So regardless of who you are, regardless of your race, or your sex,
778080	783200	or your gender, or your trans status, or your disability, or anything else, do you want to
783200	789680	destroy intersectionality? It's easy. Be a responsible person. Be humble. Lift your burdens.
789680	791680	And the thing will die on its own.
