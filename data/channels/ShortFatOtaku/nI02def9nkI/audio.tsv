0	7100	So it's I mean, I understand all ratings right? Oh, it's a business. It's a business. People are like the media has like an ethical
8700	10700	But
11040	17080	All the nice cutesy little epics that used to get talked about in journalism school you're just like that's adorable
18520	20520	That's adorable
30120	33620	On July 17th the video game retail site good old games
33880	36680	Otherwise known as gog.com made a tweet
36880	42980	advertising the game postal to the tweet reads as follows a game that wears its heart on its sleeve a
43200	45200	Sleeve that is rarely safe for work
45660	48440	Postal to paradise lost no filter
48440	55840	No DRM the tweet included a screenshot from the game showing the player pissing on a grave with the name of games journalism
55920	62920	This was taken from postal twos gamer gate DLC a tongue-in-cheek mode that included multiple gamer gate references
63340	66140	Including allowing players to kill my Leonopoulos
66840	73160	unsurprisingly social justice warriors started up the outrage machine games journalists crowed in their columns and
73280	78460	Terrorized on Twitter gog was pressured into removing the offending tweet and issuing a public apology
78460	81960	But this article from a relatively unknown progressive gaming site
82200	84360	VG 24-7 caught my eye
84840	89480	VG 24-7 is pulling its support of a gogs a storefront for the foreseeable future
89480	94240	The problem is that the gift can be interpreted as a dog whistle that patterns to hate group gamer gate
94240	100640	Which itself has been proven to lead to radicalism and even murder the murder they're referring to via that link is Ralph
100640	105140	Ritter writer Seattle for truths murder of his father when he was thrown out of his parents house
105140	109800	But here's the strange part of the article gamer gate has destroyed lives and we're very disappointed
110000	115640	That gog has furthered the divide between those who cover games and a vocal minority that hate games
115860	121680	Journalists women and minorities we hear this type of thing a lot SJWs have recognized that simply saying
122040	125740	Minorities is not enough because women aren't a minority so often
125740	133260	You'll see them list off a laundry basket full of social classes that they feel need special protection from the patriarchy women people of color
134180	140840	LGBTQIA plus folk as they like to say queer people disabled people immigrants
141460	144940	undocumented people etc etc and VG 24-7
145380	151620	Lumped games journalists into their own specific usage of this phenomenon as if the profession of journalism
151620	158300	Was itself a protected class of its own although this VG 24-7 article is about gaming journalism
158300	162160	It made me realize that most journalists in general the progressive leaning ones
162160	168940	Anyway believe that their choice of profession should afford them some type of social privilege and protection within the social justice
168940	174840	Hierarchy in much the same way that being gay or black or a woman offers benefits to these oppressed classes
175460	182200	Furthermore it's the expectation of this protection and the political rights refusal to acknowledge it that finally offers a clear explanation
182600	188160	For the media's erratic self-absorbed and downright immoral behavior since the 2016 election
188400	195000	US President Donald Trump has made the claim that the mainstream media is fake news more times than I can count going all the way back
195000	197000	to 2015
201800	206240	Don't we love that term fake what we've learned about fake over the last little while
207040	213920	Fake news, and I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It's fake phony fake
213920	242800	Of the media he's said among other things that they are the true enemy of the people and that they should stop the endless
242840	250480	hostility against him and any look at the unending unrelenting media coverage of Trump over the past few years will certainly prove him correct attack after
250480	255520	attack hit piece after hit piece insults and glib remarks and all accusations of anti-semitism
256520	258320	nazism fascism
258320	264560	Racism sexism and as many other isms as you'd like it's almost all unfounded and when Trump decides to hit back
264560	270720	He's attacking the media. He's undermining the freedom of the press. He's tearing the people against the vaunted institution of journalism
271720	278760	Trump refuses to grant journalists the protected minority status that they view themselves as having he's punching down while they're punching up
278760	282200	This is why all of Trump's misdeeds make him literally Hitler
282360	286800	Literally while the misdeeds of the media can be ignored or hand-waved away for example
287080	295200	Project Veritas a group that goes undercover to record instances of political back-channeling and corruption in both the news media and political campaigns
295280	300160	Released a video from behind the scenes at Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill's re-election campaign
300720	315760	I can tell them because she does support a semi-automatic firearm
318040	325520	Because I won't say something I shouldn't say I think semi-automatic like in a semi-automatic rifle band, okay more so what she would support
325520	327520	So here's their real question
329360	333040	Claire holds off on impeachment to get the moderates
334560	337920	What do we tell the moderates after we drop the impeachment hammer afterwards?
340200	345240	Claire distant distancing herself from the party is gonna help her win more votes than it will
345960	351640	Saying like oh, here's Obama the former president of the United States to not speak on my behalf
352440	355760	Which is unfortunate cuz I love Obama to pieces
355760	362120	I'd love to see him come here, and they essentially have the same views on everything
365640	367840	What were you telling me last night about Planned Parenthood
368720	372240	How they never they don't donate to Claire because they want to ostracize
373080	375480	pro pro-life Democrats in Missouri
377840	379320	So
379320	381560	But they still somehow give get us money
382480	389320	They put it through like different like organizations. Yeah, I think it's like a tactic that's like not make them too far
390040	392100	Left to try to get the moderate voters
392960	395760	But we're still gonna support abortion, right? Yes
400480	405200	They go through other means to support and give them money they just don't directly give the money from there like packs
405200	406680	Oh
406680	409840	It's like we have to we have to lie to get elected
411120	417040	In response to this leak McCaskill's campaign declared that project Veritas had not only done something unethical
417160	422680	But illegal and demanded that the state's Attorney General appoint a special prosecutor to investigate these alleged crimes
422880	424880	Project Veritas is another subject entirely
424880	430080	but anyone with a brain can agree that it is journalism unless of course you're a person who believes that
430320	434840	Journalists are protected class and for some reason you happen to want the perks of that class
434880	439800	Stripped away from your political opponents like Brian Tao does he's a journalist for the Wall Street Journal
440240	446280	Specializing in law and regarding this project Veritas leak he had this to say project Veritas is not journalism
446680	451280	Journalists do not misrepresent themselves by setting up stings with some very rare exceptions
451280	455840	This article would be on better grounds defending them as engaged in protected First Amendment advocacy
455840	461720	Let's put aside the sheer audacity of the claim that journalists do not set up stings for a minute project Veritas is
462280	469920	Journalism hell even most YouTube talking heads can be classified as journalists though most would reject the label because unlike a lot of actual
470200	476460	Journalists it seems youtubers recognize that the social rank of journalist not only comes with some legitimate protections
476460	482200	But a lot of responsibility as well Tao's claim that certain groups of reporters and analysts are not true
482320	488360	Journalists is a self-destructive claim to make if you can de journalist project Veritas then certainly others can
488680	494200	Dejournalist the Wall Street Journal and that's exactly what's been happening to the Wall Street Journal for years now back in early
494480	499200	2017 the Wall Street Journal went toe-to-toe with PewDiePie taking jokes and clips out of
499400	503080	Context to make him sound like a racist a Nazi an anti-semite
503160	507880	You know all of the usual overused angles of attack that we've become so entirely
508400	513820	Desensitized to at this point that they've lost all meaning and the rest of the mainstream media along with gaming and tech
514080	519960	Journalists jumped on the bandwagon pewds ended up losing a lucrative business deal with Disney over the invented controversy
519960	525600	But it didn't kill his YouTube channel or slow down his growth as the world's biggest youtuber and in retrospect
525880	532800	This seemed like the death rattle of old media lashing out against youtubers and social media for usurping their role in the cultural consciousness
533480	539080	Journalists were starting to figure out that they no longer had the social privilege as a protected class that they once held
539080	544840	But they failed to recognize that a combination of not keeping up with modern technology and trends as well as their own behavior
545080	550200	Had cost them the trust of the public and this blatantly false attack on PewDiePie wasn't the beginning
550200	555000	But just another step down a long path of eroded trust in the institution of journalism
555040	561380	The Wall Street Journal hasn't learned from its misdeeds either a recent trending hashtag trending until Twitter suppressed
561380	563380	It anyway was hashtag
563940	571180	wsj kills kids this stems from an event from several weeks ago where a YouTube livestream show called the kill stream ran an event titled
571180	574980	The heel stream where all super chat money raised would be donated to st
574980	576580	Jude's Children's Research Hospital
576580	583300	Just like the PewDiePie event the Wall Street Journal saw an opportunity to stick it to both their main competitors and their political opponents
583420	585420	Yuri Co from the Wall Street Journal
585780	589700	Emailed the owner of the kill stream Ethan Ralph in regards to an upcoming story
589700	594740	I am working on a story about how alt-right personalities have utilized YouTube super chat function
594740	601020	We're mentioning some of your live streams in the story including one that was aired and deleted in which you spoke about the Pittsburgh shooting
601020	603020	It appears that the live stream generated over
603420	608380	$500 via super chat some of the comments both paid and unpaid were problematic
608540	613660	For instance one super chat comment said if you want to know if the synagogue shooting was a false flag
613660	617300	Then check out the lucky Larry life insurance policy on those dead juice
618180	622380	Jesus regarding that live stream. Did you delete it or was that YouTube?
622540	627500	Why we're also mentioning the Ralph retorts live stream from September 29th that raised
628700	632820	$26,000 for st. Jude's I wanted to reach out in case you'd like to comment on any of this
632820	639740	I also wanted to confirm that you share the revenue from your super chats with YouTube though Ralph would ultimately refuse Co's request
639740	644940	Here's the article that would come from her efforts hate speech on live super chats tests YouTube
644940	648540	Feature that gives paid comment special treatment generates revenue
648540	655320	But can include racist comments and here's a few quotes from this article during the live stream, which YouTube said mr
655320	659340	Ralph has since deleted one user paid two British pounds to write
659340	666100	How do you get a Jewish girl's number roll up her sleeve you want to know how despite the media's kicking and screaming they still?
666340	672100	Unduly exercise their privileges as a protected class my quoting that joke will likely get this video
672260	677260	Demonetized while Yuri Co will still be paid by the Wall Street Journal for the exact same content
677460	680860	YouTube said late on Friday that it had permanently removed. Mr
680860	687100	Ralph's channel the Ralph retort from its platform for policy violations and for going against its terms of service. Mr
687100	689100	Ralph whose channel had
689140	695700	22,500 subscribers is one of several far-right YouTube celebrities who have used the super chat function to make money Ralph would
695900	701980	Independently confirm this himself on Twitter stating that his super chat button would be disabled for his upcoming live streams on his next
702100	705400	He began to criticize the Wall Street Journal on air and in
705660	711300	retaliation YouTube turned off the stream on their end and suspended all of his channels from the platform a
711420	713780	Spokeswoman for YouTube owned by alphabet inks
713780	719580	Google said the company donates to charity the proceeds from any super chats that violate its hate speech policy
719820	721820	Except they don't because all
722420	728380	$26,000 raised by Ralph's stream for st. Jude's is confirmed to have been refunded by YouTube and st
728420	733940	Jude's has also confirmed that they never had any intention of accepting the money both of these revelations came to light
733940	740200	Of course after the Wall Street Journal had a private chat with both YouTube and st. Jude's. This is why the hashtag was
741020	744620	Wsj kills kids the Wall Street Journal is willing to deny st
744620	751460	Jude's charity funds is willing to twist YouTube into breaking its own rules in order to spite somebody they view as a political opponent in
751500	756860	their eyes money for charity takes a backseat to potentially offensive speech and despite any
756940	763780	Personal differences between Ralph and myself on principle. I cannot support his removal from YouTube free speech rights are paramount
763780	767220	Even if the speech in question is hateful or stupid, of course
767220	772100	It's not just the Wall Street Journal committing morally reprehensible acts under the guise of journalism
772100	779300	I'm sure we've all heard about blatant racists like Francesca Ramsey and Sarah John moving up the media ranks based on skin color alone
779300	786020	And then there's also lesser-known stories like the tale of crosswalk Kathy various progressive leading outlets began to write hit pieces on a private citizen
786060	789580	For calling the cops on a black man for parking improperly with some
789860	793420	SJW is going so far as to doxer and smear her as a racist
793420	797280	But eventually the truth of the matter came out the woman called the parking authority
797460	803580	Not the police on a vehicle because it was parked in the middle of a crosswalk and she didn't know the race of the vehicles
803580	804300	owner at all
804300	809540	But since we're on the topic of journalists using their position to attack random citizens guilty of wrongthink
809660	815980	There was also that time that CNN blackmailed a random reddit user for making this gif. No, I'm not joking
816180	818020	I did a podcast about it back in the day
818020	822500	But the long and short of it is the moral paragons over at CNN tracked the poster down
822740	830180	Accused him of the usual basket of SJW slurs and threatened to reveal his identity if he didn't leave the internet in their self-damning
830380	836380	Article titled how CNN found the reddit user behind the Trump wrestling gif CNN is not publishing
836380	841580	Han asshole solos name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology
841900	847700	Showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all of his offending posts and because he said he is not going to repeat
847700	850460	This ugly behavior on social media again in addition
850460	854140	He said his statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same
854420	858340	CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change
858540	865300	This is why the protected status of journalists is no longer respected by Donald Trump by the conservative wing of politics
865400	870580	By most average people journalists no longer wield that privilege with restraint and wisdom
871020	873620	Instead they use it as a bludgeon against their opponents
873620	880340	I could keep going with examples of the media acting ridiculous and irresponsible at best and immoral and corrupt at worst like CNN's
880340	887100	Jim Acosta virtue signaling in public over Kanye West saying the word motherfucker in the Oval Office while in private
887460	889680	DMing fuck you to one of his critics on Twitter
889680	894800	But because I am a gamer let me indulge a bit with one final example from the gaming industry
895120	898640	Blizzcon 2018 happened recently and at the event
898960	906840	Blizzard took the opportunity to show off their new Diablo game Diablo immortal Diablo is a long-running much beloved PC RPG series
906960	910960	But this latest entry is a phone game on the gaming side of the story
910960	915700	There was a lot of funny stuff going down like the crowd heckling the developers and the developers
915980	923260	Exceptionally poor response in return. We want to use mobile devices as the platform for a new
924140	925860	Diablo game
925860	930020	Because nothing brings a family together like slaying demons
930140	935160	Hey, just was wondering is this an out-of-season April Fool's joke
939380	942240	No, it's it's a it's a fully
943180	948980	Fully fledged Diablo experience on on mobile which everybody will get to play
953980	961380	Is there any plans to make this playable on PC or is this a strictly mobile forever
961980	967500	Are there any yeah this the current plan is to be on mobile both?
967940	969940	Android and iOS
970340	974520	We don't have any plans at the moment to do PC
974520	976520	Do
979400	981400	You guys want have phone yeah you guys
982560	988840	If you want to know more we'll be back here on the mythic stage in just a few minutes
992740	994740	We are gonna have
995280	996720	Sorry
996720	1004280	Or the company tasking YouTube to delete hundreds of thousands of downvotes and negative comments on the official Diablo immortal reveal trailers
1004360	1010120	a fact that can be verified by comparing the live numbers to the numbers tracked on social blade or that the response was so
1010320	1018360	overwhelmingly negative to Diablo immortal that all the Diablo social media accounts switched their icons and official branding from the new Diablo immortal stuff
1018360	1023000	Back to Diablo 3 or that it was discovered by the Internet's greatest autistic minds
1023000	1030960	The Diablo immortal was outsourced to a Chinese company known for making Diablo mobile ripoffs and that Chinese company simply took one of their
1031320	1032840	Pre-existing games and
1032840	1041160	Reskinned it with the Diablo brand or Blizzard's main competitors directly making fun of the massive Diablo immortal fumble on social media or that Blizzard
1041360	1048300	Themselves as an April Fool's joke in 2014 announced a Diablo mobile game specifically making fun of how diluted
1048480	1050400	dumbed down and
1050400	1057060	Disrespectful to existing IPs that phone games can be or that the red shirted bald hero that was willing to stick it to the developers
1057060	1063980	Live not only posted on 4chan asking what he should say before it was his turn but also that his reddit history showed that he
1063980	1066940	Routinely fucks other women with his wife and threesomes
1067300	1074060	Forget about EA's constant fuck-ups with Star Wars or Microsoft's self-destruction of the Xbox one by claiming that consumers who don't like it can
1074060	1075620	Just play the Xbox 360
1075620	1078980	I think blizzards taken the crown on the best way to shotgun yourself in the face
1078980	1080580	But while that's all good fun
1080580	1083700	The relevant part is the journalist response to the outrage
1083900	1090900	Diablo immortal is actually fun you entitled babies the people that bash on mobile gaming are an offshoot of toxic masculinity
1090900	1097180	They get off on hating something that they've traditionally associated with a heavily female audience don't like playing a specific kind of game on mobile
1097180	1104020	That's cool. Reject mobile platforms whatsoever and pretend they are inferior. Yeah, that's pretty toxic. This wasn't savagery
1104020	1107940	It was fucking obnoxious embarrassing behavior. I get why people are mad
1107940	1113260	I really do but you can be critical without being an asshole to people who spend their lives trying to entertain you
1113340	1118540	Of course the first thing I see when I wake up is Diablo immortal haters now saying that Blizzcon was a slap in the face
1118540	1122260	I roll gif if you can't see the potential of a Diablo game on mobile
1122260	1127460	You know shit all about video games the reaction to Diablo eternal. You got that wrong there champ
1127460	1132460	Don't expect any Blizzard shill shekels the reaction to Diablo eternal from so many
1132540	1138540	Gamers makes me want to not play video games or have anything to do with gaming anymore fans react to Diablo immortal like
1138740	1144140	Disrespectful edgelords hot take after hot take shill after shill virtue signal after virtue signal
1144660	1150060	Assertions that gamers are man-babies demands that consumers blindly purchase whatever companies give them
1150380	1157920	Accusations that complainers are ungrateful because they dislike a product not having learned a single goddamn thing from gamergate lefty games journalists
1157940	1165660	Demonize their own audience ignore the legitimate arguments against Diablo immortal inside with the 83 billion dollar company over the concerns of an average
1165780	1172100	Person and should you one of those average people decide to call them out on this you'll be contributing to Trump's demonization of the media
1172100	1174100	You'll be vilifying journalism
1174100	1179300	You'll be disrespecting the journalists rightful place as a protected class alongside women and minorities
1179300	1182020	But the journalist is not a protected class
1182220	1187100	Maybe in an ideal world due to the nature of the job that a good journalist should perform
1187100	1192460	Maybe they should be somewhat protected exposing corrupt governments or corporations speaking truth to power
1192900	1194900	Uncovering scandals and holding people accountable
1194940	1199020	These are the jobs of the journalist and these are the jobs that we need to see done
1199340	1203060	Society is better as a whole when a good journalist is successful
1203060	1208220	But none of the journalists anymore seem to be good from something as benign as video games all the way up to the White House
1208740	1212020	Journalists have decided that their job is no longer to report on events
1212020	1218060	But to create the context of those events that people they look down upon must be obligated to consume. Why is this happened?
1218060	1224580	I don't know. Maybe it's because social justice controls both academia and entertainment right now and the long-term results of that
1224580	1229340	Is that SJW kids from 10 or 15 years ago are now SJW journalists today?
1229460	1231780	Maybe it's because as multiple articles in
1232020	1239260	2017 pointed out with glee new studies have shown that journalists brains function at lower levels in the average persons due to an excess
1239300	1243220	consumption of alcohol caffeine and sugar rendering them unable to think objectively
