WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.100
So it's I mean, I understand all ratings right? Oh, it's a business. It's a business. People are like the media has like an ethical

00:08.700 --> 00:10.700
But

00:11.040 --> 00:17.080
All the nice cutesy little epics that used to get talked about in journalism school you're just like that's adorable

00:18.520 --> 00:20.520
That's adorable

00:30.120 --> 00:33.620
On July 17th the video game retail site good old games

00:33.880 --> 00:36.680
Otherwise known as gog.com made a tweet

00:36.880 --> 00:42.980
advertising the game postal to the tweet reads as follows a game that wears its heart on its sleeve a

00:43.200 --> 00:45.200
Sleeve that is rarely safe for work

00:45.660 --> 00:48.440
Postal to paradise lost no filter

00:48.440 --> 00:55.840
No DRM the tweet included a screenshot from the game showing the player pissing on a grave with the name of games journalism

00:55.920 --> 01:02.920
This was taken from postal twos gamer gate DLC a tongue-in-cheek mode that included multiple gamer gate references

01:03.340 --> 01:06.140
Including allowing players to kill my Leonopoulos

01:06.840 --> 01:13.160
unsurprisingly social justice warriors started up the outrage machine games journalists crowed in their columns and

01:13.280 --> 01:18.460
Terrorized on Twitter gog was pressured into removing the offending tweet and issuing a public apology

01:18.460 --> 01:21.960
But this article from a relatively unknown progressive gaming site

01:22.200 --> 01:24.360
VG 24-7 caught my eye

01:24.840 --> 01:29.480
VG 24-7 is pulling its support of a gogs a storefront for the foreseeable future

01:29.480 --> 01:34.240
The problem is that the gift can be interpreted as a dog whistle that patterns to hate group gamer gate

01:34.240 --> 01:40.640
Which itself has been proven to lead to radicalism and even murder the murder they're referring to via that link is Ralph

01:40.640 --> 01:45.140
Ritter writer Seattle for truths murder of his father when he was thrown out of his parents house

01:45.140 --> 01:49.800
But here's the strange part of the article gamer gate has destroyed lives and we're very disappointed

01:50.000 --> 01:55.640
That gog has furthered the divide between those who cover games and a vocal minority that hate games

01:55.860 --> 02:01.680
Journalists women and minorities we hear this type of thing a lot SJWs have recognized that simply saying

02:02.040 --> 02:05.740
Minorities is not enough because women aren't a minority so often

02:05.740 --> 02:13.260
You'll see them list off a laundry basket full of social classes that they feel need special protection from the patriarchy women people of color

02:14.180 --> 02:20.840
LGBTQIA plus folk as they like to say queer people disabled people immigrants

02:21.460 --> 02:24.940
undocumented people etc etc and VG 24-7

02:25.380 --> 02:31.620
Lumped games journalists into their own specific usage of this phenomenon as if the profession of journalism

02:31.620 --> 02:38.300
Was itself a protected class of its own although this VG 24-7 article is about gaming journalism

02:38.300 --> 02:42.160
It made me realize that most journalists in general the progressive leaning ones

02:42.160 --> 02:48.940
Anyway believe that their choice of profession should afford them some type of social privilege and protection within the social justice

02:48.940 --> 02:54.840
Hierarchy in much the same way that being gay or black or a woman offers benefits to these oppressed classes

02:55.460 --> 03:02.200
Furthermore it's the expectation of this protection and the political rights refusal to acknowledge it that finally offers a clear explanation

03:02.600 --> 03:08.160
For the media's erratic self-absorbed and downright immoral behavior since the 2016 election

03:08.400 --> 03:15.000
US President Donald Trump has made the claim that the mainstream media is fake news more times than I can count going all the way back

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
to 2015

03:21.800 --> 03:26.240
Don't we love that term fake what we've learned about fake over the last little while

03:27.040 --> 03:33.920
Fake news, and I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It's fake phony fake

03:33.920 --> 04:02.800
Of the media he's said among other things that they are the true enemy of the people and that they should stop the endless

04:02.840 --> 04:10.480
hostility against him and any look at the unending unrelenting media coverage of Trump over the past few years will certainly prove him correct attack after

04:10.480 --> 04:15.520
attack hit piece after hit piece insults and glib remarks and all accusations of anti-semitism

04:16.520 --> 04:18.320
nazism fascism

04:18.320 --> 04:24.560
Racism sexism and as many other isms as you'd like it's almost all unfounded and when Trump decides to hit back

04:24.560 --> 04:30.720
He's attacking the media. He's undermining the freedom of the press. He's tearing the people against the vaunted institution of journalism

04:31.720 --> 04:38.760
Trump refuses to grant journalists the protected minority status that they view themselves as having he's punching down while they're punching up

04:38.760 --> 04:42.200
This is why all of Trump's misdeeds make him literally Hitler

04:42.360 --> 04:46.800
Literally while the misdeeds of the media can be ignored or hand-waved away for example

04:47.080 --> 04:55.200
Project Veritas a group that goes undercover to record instances of political back-channeling and corruption in both the news media and political campaigns

04:55.280 --> 05:00.160
Released a video from behind the scenes at Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill's re-election campaign

05:00.720 --> 05:15.760
I can tell them because she does support a semi-automatic firearm

05:18.040 --> 05:25.520
Because I won't say something I shouldn't say I think semi-automatic like in a semi-automatic rifle band, okay more so what she would support

05:25.520 --> 05:27.520
So here's their real question

05:29.360 --> 05:33.040
Claire holds off on impeachment to get the moderates

05:34.560 --> 05:37.920
What do we tell the moderates after we drop the impeachment hammer afterwards?

05:40.200 --> 05:45.240
Claire distant distancing herself from the party is gonna help her win more votes than it will

05:45.960 --> 05:51.640
Saying like oh, here's Obama the former president of the United States to not speak on my behalf

05:52.440 --> 05:55.760
Which is unfortunate cuz I love Obama to pieces

05:55.760 --> 06:02.120
I'd love to see him come here, and they essentially have the same views on everything

06:05.640 --> 06:07.840
What were you telling me last night about Planned Parenthood

06:08.720 --> 06:12.240
How they never they don't donate to Claire because they want to ostracize

06:13.080 --> 06:15.480
pro pro-life Democrats in Missouri

06:17.840 --> 06:19.320
So

06:19.320 --> 06:21.560
But they still somehow give get us money

06:22.480 --> 06:29.320
They put it through like different like organizations. Yeah, I think it's like a tactic that's like not make them too far

06:30.040 --> 06:32.100
Left to try to get the moderate voters

06:32.960 --> 06:35.760
But we're still gonna support abortion, right? Yes

06:40.480 --> 06:45.200
They go through other means to support and give them money they just don't directly give the money from there like packs

06:45.200 --> 06:46.680
Oh

06:46.680 --> 06:49.840
It's like we have to we have to lie to get elected

06:51.120 --> 06:57.040
In response to this leak McCaskill's campaign declared that project Veritas had not only done something unethical

06:57.160 --> 07:02.680
But illegal and demanded that the state's Attorney General appoint a special prosecutor to investigate these alleged crimes

07:02.880 --> 07:04.880
Project Veritas is another subject entirely

07:04.880 --> 07:10.080
but anyone with a brain can agree that it is journalism unless of course you're a person who believes that

07:10.320 --> 07:14.840
Journalists are protected class and for some reason you happen to want the perks of that class

07:14.880 --> 07:19.800
Stripped away from your political opponents like Brian Tao does he's a journalist for the Wall Street Journal

07:20.240 --> 07:26.280
Specializing in law and regarding this project Veritas leak he had this to say project Veritas is not journalism

07:26.680 --> 07:31.280
Journalists do not misrepresent themselves by setting up stings with some very rare exceptions

07:31.280 --> 07:35.840
This article would be on better grounds defending them as engaged in protected First Amendment advocacy

07:35.840 --> 07:41.720
Let's put aside the sheer audacity of the claim that journalists do not set up stings for a minute project Veritas is

07:42.280 --> 07:49.920
Journalism hell even most YouTube talking heads can be classified as journalists though most would reject the label because unlike a lot of actual

07:50.200 --> 07:56.460
Journalists it seems youtubers recognize that the social rank of journalist not only comes with some legitimate protections

07:56.460 --> 08:02.200
But a lot of responsibility as well Tao's claim that certain groups of reporters and analysts are not true

08:02.320 --> 08:08.360
Journalists is a self-destructive claim to make if you can de journalist project Veritas then certainly others can

08:08.680 --> 08:14.200
Dejournalist the Wall Street Journal and that's exactly what's been happening to the Wall Street Journal for years now back in early

08:14.480 --> 08:19.200
2017 the Wall Street Journal went toe-to-toe with PewDiePie taking jokes and clips out of

08:19.400 --> 08:23.080
Context to make him sound like a racist a Nazi an anti-semite

08:23.160 --> 08:27.880
You know all of the usual overused angles of attack that we've become so entirely

08:28.400 --> 08:33.820
Desensitized to at this point that they've lost all meaning and the rest of the mainstream media along with gaming and tech

08:34.080 --> 08:39.960
Journalists jumped on the bandwagon pewds ended up losing a lucrative business deal with Disney over the invented controversy

08:39.960 --> 08:45.600
But it didn't kill his YouTube channel or slow down his growth as the world's biggest youtuber and in retrospect

08:45.880 --> 08:52.800
This seemed like the death rattle of old media lashing out against youtubers and social media for usurping their role in the cultural consciousness

08:53.480 --> 08:59.080
Journalists were starting to figure out that they no longer had the social privilege as a protected class that they once held

08:59.080 --> 09:04.840
But they failed to recognize that a combination of not keeping up with modern technology and trends as well as their own behavior

09:05.080 --> 09:10.200
Had cost them the trust of the public and this blatantly false attack on PewDiePie wasn't the beginning

09:10.200 --> 09:15.000
But just another step down a long path of eroded trust in the institution of journalism

09:15.040 --> 09:21.380
The Wall Street Journal hasn't learned from its misdeeds either a recent trending hashtag trending until Twitter suppressed

09:21.380 --> 09:23.380
It anyway was hashtag

09:23.940 --> 09:31.180
wsj kills kids this stems from an event from several weeks ago where a YouTube livestream show called the kill stream ran an event titled

09:31.180 --> 09:34.980
The heel stream where all super chat money raised would be donated to st

09:34.980 --> 09:36.580
Jude's Children's Research Hospital

09:36.580 --> 09:43.300
Just like the PewDiePie event the Wall Street Journal saw an opportunity to stick it to both their main competitors and their political opponents

09:43.420 --> 09:45.420
Yuri Co from the Wall Street Journal

09:45.780 --> 09:49.700
Emailed the owner of the kill stream Ethan Ralph in regards to an upcoming story

09:49.700 --> 09:54.740
I am working on a story about how alt-right personalities have utilized YouTube super chat function

09:54.740 --> 10:01.020
We're mentioning some of your live streams in the story including one that was aired and deleted in which you spoke about the Pittsburgh shooting

10:01.020 --> 10:03.020
It appears that the live stream generated over

10:03.420 --> 10:08.380
$500 via super chat some of the comments both paid and unpaid were problematic

10:08.540 --> 10:13.660
For instance one super chat comment said if you want to know if the synagogue shooting was a false flag

10:13.660 --> 10:17.300
Then check out the lucky Larry life insurance policy on those dead juice

10:18.180 --> 10:22.380
Jesus regarding that live stream. Did you delete it or was that YouTube?

10:22.540 --> 10:27.500
Why we're also mentioning the Ralph retorts live stream from September 29th that raised

10:28.700 --> 10:32.820
$26,000 for st. Jude's I wanted to reach out in case you'd like to comment on any of this

10:32.820 --> 10:39.740
I also wanted to confirm that you share the revenue from your super chats with YouTube though Ralph would ultimately refuse Co's request

10:39.740 --> 10:44.940
Here's the article that would come from her efforts hate speech on live super chats tests YouTube

10:44.940 --> 10:48.540
Feature that gives paid comment special treatment generates revenue

10:48.540 --> 10:55.320
But can include racist comments and here's a few quotes from this article during the live stream, which YouTube said mr

10:55.320 --> 10:59.340
Ralph has since deleted one user paid two British pounds to write

10:59.340 --> 11:06.100
How do you get a Jewish girl's number roll up her sleeve you want to know how despite the media's kicking and screaming they still?

11:06.340 --> 11:12.100
Unduly exercise their privileges as a protected class my quoting that joke will likely get this video

11:12.260 --> 11:17.260
Demonetized while Yuri Co will still be paid by the Wall Street Journal for the exact same content

11:17.460 --> 11:20.860
YouTube said late on Friday that it had permanently removed. Mr

11:20.860 --> 11:27.100
Ralph's channel the Ralph retort from its platform for policy violations and for going against its terms of service. Mr

11:27.100 --> 11:29.100
Ralph whose channel had

11:29.140 --> 11:35.700
22,500 subscribers is one of several far-right YouTube celebrities who have used the super chat function to make money Ralph would

11:35.900 --> 11:41.980
Independently confirm this himself on Twitter stating that his super chat button would be disabled for his upcoming live streams on his next

11:42.100 --> 11:45.400
He began to criticize the Wall Street Journal on air and in

11:45.660 --> 11:51.300
retaliation YouTube turned off the stream on their end and suspended all of his channels from the platform a

11:51.420 --> 11:53.780
Spokeswoman for YouTube owned by alphabet inks

11:53.780 --> 11:59.580
Google said the company donates to charity the proceeds from any super chats that violate its hate speech policy

11:59.820 --> 12:01.820
Except they don't because all

12:02.420 --> 12:08.380
$26,000 raised by Ralph's stream for st. Jude's is confirmed to have been refunded by YouTube and st

12:08.420 --> 12:13.940
Jude's has also confirmed that they never had any intention of accepting the money both of these revelations came to light

12:13.940 --> 12:20.200
Of course after the Wall Street Journal had a private chat with both YouTube and st. Jude's. This is why the hashtag was

12:21.020 --> 12:24.620
Wsj kills kids the Wall Street Journal is willing to deny st

12:24.620 --> 12:31.460
Jude's charity funds is willing to twist YouTube into breaking its own rules in order to spite somebody they view as a political opponent in

12:31.500 --> 12:36.860
their eyes money for charity takes a backseat to potentially offensive speech and despite any

12:36.940 --> 12:43.780
Personal differences between Ralph and myself on principle. I cannot support his removal from YouTube free speech rights are paramount

12:43.780 --> 12:47.220
Even if the speech in question is hateful or stupid, of course

12:47.220 --> 12:52.100
It's not just the Wall Street Journal committing morally reprehensible acts under the guise of journalism

12:52.100 --> 12:59.300
I'm sure we've all heard about blatant racists like Francesca Ramsey and Sarah John moving up the media ranks based on skin color alone

12:59.300 --> 13:06.020
And then there's also lesser-known stories like the tale of crosswalk Kathy various progressive leading outlets began to write hit pieces on a private citizen

13:06.060 --> 13:09.580
For calling the cops on a black man for parking improperly with some

13:09.860 --> 13:13.420
SJW is going so far as to doxer and smear her as a racist

13:13.420 --> 13:17.280
But eventually the truth of the matter came out the woman called the parking authority

13:17.460 --> 13:23.580
Not the police on a vehicle because it was parked in the middle of a crosswalk and she didn't know the race of the vehicles

13:23.580 --> 13:24.300
owner at all

13:24.300 --> 13:29.540
But since we're on the topic of journalists using their position to attack random citizens guilty of wrongthink

13:29.660 --> 13:35.980
There was also that time that CNN blackmailed a random reddit user for making this gif. No, I'm not joking

13:36.180 --> 13:38.020
I did a podcast about it back in the day

13:38.020 --> 13:42.500
But the long and short of it is the moral paragons over at CNN tracked the poster down

13:42.740 --> 13:50.180
Accused him of the usual basket of SJW slurs and threatened to reveal his identity if he didn't leave the internet in their self-damning

13:50.380 --> 13:56.380
Article titled how CNN found the reddit user behind the Trump wrestling gif CNN is not publishing

13:56.380 --> 14:01.580
Han asshole solos name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology

14:01.900 --> 14:07.700
Showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all of his offending posts and because he said he is not going to repeat

14:07.700 --> 14:10.460
This ugly behavior on social media again in addition

14:10.460 --> 14:14.140
He said his statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same

14:14.420 --> 14:18.340
CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change

14:18.540 --> 14:25.300
This is why the protected status of journalists is no longer respected by Donald Trump by the conservative wing of politics

14:25.400 --> 14:30.580
By most average people journalists no longer wield that privilege with restraint and wisdom

14:31.020 --> 14:33.620
Instead they use it as a bludgeon against their opponents

14:33.620 --> 14:40.340
I could keep going with examples of the media acting ridiculous and irresponsible at best and immoral and corrupt at worst like CNN's

14:40.340 --> 14:47.100
Jim Acosta virtue signaling in public over Kanye West saying the word motherfucker in the Oval Office while in private

14:47.460 --> 14:49.680
DMing fuck you to one of his critics on Twitter

14:49.680 --> 14:54.800
But because I am a gamer let me indulge a bit with one final example from the gaming industry

14:55.120 --> 14:58.640
Blizzcon 2018 happened recently and at the event

14:58.960 --> 15:06.840
Blizzard took the opportunity to show off their new Diablo game Diablo immortal Diablo is a long-running much beloved PC RPG series

15:06.960 --> 15:10.960
But this latest entry is a phone game on the gaming side of the story

15:10.960 --> 15:15.700
There was a lot of funny stuff going down like the crowd heckling the developers and the developers

15:15.980 --> 15:23.260
Exceptionally poor response in return. We want to use mobile devices as the platform for a new

15:24.140 --> 15:25.860
Diablo game

15:25.860 --> 15:30.020
Because nothing brings a family together like slaying demons

15:30.140 --> 15:35.160
Hey, just was wondering is this an out-of-season April Fool's joke

15:39.380 --> 15:42.240
No, it's it's a it's a fully

15:43.180 --> 15:48.980
Fully fledged Diablo experience on on mobile which everybody will get to play

15:53.980 --> 16:01.380
Is there any plans to make this playable on PC or is this a strictly mobile forever

16:01.980 --> 16:07.500
Are there any yeah this the current plan is to be on mobile both?

16:07.940 --> 16:09.940
Android and iOS

16:10.340 --> 16:14.520
We don't have any plans at the moment to do PC

16:14.520 --> 16:16.520
Do

16:19.400 --> 16:21.400
You guys want have phone yeah you guys

16:22.560 --> 16:28.840
If you want to know more we'll be back here on the mythic stage in just a few minutes

16:32.740 --> 16:34.740
We are gonna have

16:35.280 --> 16:36.720
Sorry

16:36.720 --> 16:44.280
Or the company tasking YouTube to delete hundreds of thousands of downvotes and negative comments on the official Diablo immortal reveal trailers

16:44.360 --> 16:50.120
a fact that can be verified by comparing the live numbers to the numbers tracked on social blade or that the response was so

16:50.320 --> 16:58.360
overwhelmingly negative to Diablo immortal that all the Diablo social media accounts switched their icons and official branding from the new Diablo immortal stuff

16:58.360 --> 17:03.000
Back to Diablo 3 or that it was discovered by the Internet's greatest autistic minds

17:03.000 --> 17:10.960
The Diablo immortal was outsourced to a Chinese company known for making Diablo mobile ripoffs and that Chinese company simply took one of their

17:11.320 --> 17:12.840
Pre-existing games and

17:12.840 --> 17:21.160
Reskinned it with the Diablo brand or Blizzard's main competitors directly making fun of the massive Diablo immortal fumble on social media or that Blizzard

17:21.360 --> 17:28.300
Themselves as an April Fool's joke in 2014 announced a Diablo mobile game specifically making fun of how diluted

17:28.480 --> 17:30.400
dumbed down and

17:30.400 --> 17:37.060
Disrespectful to existing IPs that phone games can be or that the red shirted bald hero that was willing to stick it to the developers

17:37.060 --> 17:43.980
Live not only posted on 4chan asking what he should say before it was his turn but also that his reddit history showed that he

17:43.980 --> 17:46.940
Routinely fucks other women with his wife and threesomes

17:47.300 --> 17:54.060
Forget about EA's constant fuck-ups with Star Wars or Microsoft's self-destruction of the Xbox one by claiming that consumers who don't like it can

17:54.060 --> 17:55.620
Just play the Xbox 360

17:55.620 --> 17:58.980
I think blizzards taken the crown on the best way to shotgun yourself in the face

17:58.980 --> 18:00.580
But while that's all good fun

18:00.580 --> 18:03.700
The relevant part is the journalist response to the outrage

18:03.900 --> 18:10.900
Diablo immortal is actually fun you entitled babies the people that bash on mobile gaming are an offshoot of toxic masculinity

18:10.900 --> 18:17.180
They get off on hating something that they've traditionally associated with a heavily female audience don't like playing a specific kind of game on mobile

18:17.180 --> 18:24.020
That's cool. Reject mobile platforms whatsoever and pretend they are inferior. Yeah, that's pretty toxic. This wasn't savagery

18:24.020 --> 18:27.940
It was fucking obnoxious embarrassing behavior. I get why people are mad

18:27.940 --> 18:33.260
I really do but you can be critical without being an asshole to people who spend their lives trying to entertain you

18:33.340 --> 18:38.540
Of course the first thing I see when I wake up is Diablo immortal haters now saying that Blizzcon was a slap in the face

18:38.540 --> 18:42.260
I roll gif if you can't see the potential of a Diablo game on mobile

18:42.260 --> 18:47.460
You know shit all about video games the reaction to Diablo eternal. You got that wrong there champ

18:47.460 --> 18:52.460
Don't expect any Blizzard shill shekels the reaction to Diablo eternal from so many

18:52.540 --> 18:58.540
Gamers makes me want to not play video games or have anything to do with gaming anymore fans react to Diablo immortal like

18:58.740 --> 19:04.140
Disrespectful edgelords hot take after hot take shill after shill virtue signal after virtue signal

19:04.660 --> 19:10.060
Assertions that gamers are man-babies demands that consumers blindly purchase whatever companies give them

19:10.380 --> 19:17.920
Accusations that complainers are ungrateful because they dislike a product not having learned a single goddamn thing from gamergate lefty games journalists

19:17.940 --> 19:25.660
Demonize their own audience ignore the legitimate arguments against Diablo immortal inside with the 83 billion dollar company over the concerns of an average

19:25.780 --> 19:32.100
Person and should you one of those average people decide to call them out on this you'll be contributing to Trump's demonization of the media

19:32.100 --> 19:34.100
You'll be vilifying journalism

19:34.100 --> 19:39.300
You'll be disrespecting the journalists rightful place as a protected class alongside women and minorities

19:39.300 --> 19:42.020
But the journalist is not a protected class

19:42.220 --> 19:47.100
Maybe in an ideal world due to the nature of the job that a good journalist should perform

19:47.100 --> 19:52.460
Maybe they should be somewhat protected exposing corrupt governments or corporations speaking truth to power

19:52.900 --> 19:54.900
Uncovering scandals and holding people accountable

19:54.940 --> 19:59.020
These are the jobs of the journalist and these are the jobs that we need to see done

19:59.340 --> 20:03.060
Society is better as a whole when a good journalist is successful

20:03.060 --> 20:08.220
But none of the journalists anymore seem to be good from something as benign as video games all the way up to the White House

20:08.740 --> 20:12.020
Journalists have decided that their job is no longer to report on events

20:12.020 --> 20:18.060
But to create the context of those events that people they look down upon must be obligated to consume. Why is this happened?

20:18.060 --> 20:24.580
I don't know. Maybe it's because social justice controls both academia and entertainment right now and the long-term results of that

20:24.580 --> 20:29.340
Is that SJW kids from 10 or 15 years ago are now SJW journalists today?

20:29.460 --> 20:31.780
Maybe it's because as multiple articles in

20:32.020 --> 20:39.260
2017 pointed out with glee new studies have shown that journalists brains function at lower levels in the average persons due to an excess

20:39.300 --> 20:43.220
consumption of alcohol caffeine and sugar rendering them unable to think objectively

20:43.980 --> 20:47.060
multitask problem-solve or be creative in any case

20:47.540 --> 20:50.500
Journalists are not a protected class as long as they behave

20:50.500 --> 20:56.380
So grotesquely we can never accept them as one if they want the privilege of social protection in order to do their dangerous work

20:56.380 --> 21:01.420
They need to actually start doing that work again until then. They're simply fake news

21:17.060 --> 21:19.060
You
