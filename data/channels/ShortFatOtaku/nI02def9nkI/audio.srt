1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,100
So it's I mean, I understand all ratings right? Oh, it's a business. It's a business. People are like the media has like an ethical

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,700
But

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,080
All the nice cutesy little epics that used to get talked about in journalism school you're just like that's adorable

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,520
That's adorable

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,620
On July 17th the video game retail site good old games

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,680
Otherwise known as gog.com made a tweet

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,980
advertising the game postal to the tweet reads as follows a game that wears its heart on its sleeve a

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Sleeve that is rarely safe for work

9
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,440
Postal to paradise lost no filter

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:55,840
No DRM the tweet included a screenshot from the game showing the player pissing on a grave with the name of games journalism

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,920
This was taken from postal twos gamer gate DLC a tongue-in-cheek mode that included multiple gamer gate references

12
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,140
Including allowing players to kill my Leonopoulos

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,160
unsurprisingly social justice warriors started up the outrage machine games journalists crowed in their columns and

14
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,460
Terrorized on Twitter gog was pressured into removing the offending tweet and issuing a public apology

15
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,960
But this article from a relatively unknown progressive gaming site

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,360
VG 24-7 caught my eye

17
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,480
VG 24-7 is pulling its support of a gogs a storefront for the foreseeable future

18
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,240
The problem is that the gift can be interpreted as a dog whistle that patterns to hate group gamer gate

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,640
Which itself has been proven to lead to radicalism and even murder the murder they're referring to via that link is Ralph

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,140
Ritter writer Seattle for truths murder of his father when he was thrown out of his parents house

21
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,800
But here's the strange part of the article gamer gate has destroyed lives and we're very disappointed

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,640
That gog has furthered the divide between those who cover games and a vocal minority that hate games

23
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,680
Journalists women and minorities we hear this type of thing a lot SJWs have recognized that simply saying

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,740
Minorities is not enough because women aren't a minority so often

25
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:13,260
You'll see them list off a laundry basket full of social classes that they feel need special protection from the patriarchy women people of color

26
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:20,840
LGBTQIA plus folk as they like to say queer people disabled people immigrants

27
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,940
undocumented people etc etc and VG 24-7

28
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:31,620
Lumped games journalists into their own specific usage of this phenomenon as if the profession of journalism

29
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:38,300
Was itself a protected class of its own although this VG 24-7 article is about gaming journalism

30
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,160
It made me realize that most journalists in general the progressive leaning ones

31
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,940
Anyway believe that their choice of profession should afford them some type of social privilege and protection within the social justice

32
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:54,840
Hierarchy in much the same way that being gay or black or a woman offers benefits to these oppressed classes

33
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:02,200
Furthermore it's the expectation of this protection and the political rights refusal to acknowledge it that finally offers a clear explanation

34
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,160
For the media's erratic self-absorbed and downright immoral behavior since the 2016 election

35
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,000
US President Donald Trump has made the claim that the mainstream media is fake news more times than I can count going all the way back

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
to 2015

37
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,240
Don't we love that term fake what we've learned about fake over the last little while

38
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,920
Fake news, and I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It's fake phony fake

39
00:03:33,920 --> 00:04:02,800
Of the media he's said among other things that they are the true enemy of the people and that they should stop the endless

40
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:10,480
hostility against him and any look at the unending unrelenting media coverage of Trump over the past few years will certainly prove him correct attack after

41
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,520
attack hit piece after hit piece insults and glib remarks and all accusations of anti-semitism

42
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,320
nazism fascism

43
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,560
Racism sexism and as many other isms as you'd like it's almost all unfounded and when Trump decides to hit back

44
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,720
He's attacking the media. He's undermining the freedom of the press. He's tearing the people against the vaunted institution of journalism

45
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,760
Trump refuses to grant journalists the protected minority status that they view themselves as having he's punching down while they're punching up

46
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,200
This is why all of Trump's misdeeds make him literally Hitler

47
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,800
Literally while the misdeeds of the media can be ignored or hand-waved away for example

48
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:55,200
Project Veritas a group that goes undercover to record instances of political back-channeling and corruption in both the news media and political campaigns

49
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,160
Released a video from behind the scenes at Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill's re-election campaign

50
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:15,760
I can tell them because she does support a semi-automatic firearm

51
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:25,520
Because I won't say something I shouldn't say I think semi-automatic like in a semi-automatic rifle band, okay more so what she would support

52
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
So here's their real question

53
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,040
Claire holds off on impeachment to get the moderates

54
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,920
What do we tell the moderates after we drop the impeachment hammer afterwards?

55
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,240
Claire distant distancing herself from the party is gonna help her win more votes than it will

56
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,640
Saying like oh, here's Obama the former president of the United States to not speak on my behalf

57
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,760
Which is unfortunate cuz I love Obama to pieces

58
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:02,120
I'd love to see him come here, and they essentially have the same views on everything

59
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,840
What were you telling me last night about Planned Parenthood

60
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,240
How they never they don't donate to Claire because they want to ostracize

61
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,480
pro pro-life Democrats in Missouri

62
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,320
So

63
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,560
But they still somehow give get us money

64
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:29,320
They put it through like different like organizations. Yeah, I think it's like a tactic that's like not make them too far

65
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,100
Left to try to get the moderate voters

66
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,760
But we're still gonna support abortion, right? Yes

67
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,200
They go through other means to support and give them money they just don't directly give the money from there like packs

68
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,680
Oh

69
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,840
It's like we have to we have to lie to get elected

70
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,040
In response to this leak McCaskill's campaign declared that project Veritas had not only done something unethical

71
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,680
But illegal and demanded that the state's Attorney General appoint a special prosecutor to investigate these alleged crimes

72
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
Project Veritas is another subject entirely

73
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,080
but anyone with a brain can agree that it is journalism unless of course you're a person who believes that

74
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,840
Journalists are protected class and for some reason you happen to want the perks of that class

75
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,800
Stripped away from your political opponents like Brian Tao does he's a journalist for the Wall Street Journal

76
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,280
Specializing in law and regarding this project Veritas leak he had this to say project Veritas is not journalism

77
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,280
Journalists do not misrepresent themselves by setting up stings with some very rare exceptions

78
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,840
This article would be on better grounds defending them as engaged in protected First Amendment advocacy

79
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,720
Let's put aside the sheer audacity of the claim that journalists do not set up stings for a minute project Veritas is

80
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:49,920
Journalism hell even most YouTube talking heads can be classified as journalists though most would reject the label because unlike a lot of actual

81
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:56,460
Journalists it seems youtubers recognize that the social rank of journalist not only comes with some legitimate protections

82
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:02,200
But a lot of responsibility as well Tao's claim that certain groups of reporters and analysts are not true

83
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:08,360
Journalists is a self-destructive claim to make if you can de journalist project Veritas then certainly others can

84
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,200
Dejournalist the Wall Street Journal and that's exactly what's been happening to the Wall Street Journal for years now back in early

85
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,200
2017 the Wall Street Journal went toe-to-toe with PewDiePie taking jokes and clips out of

86
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,080
Context to make him sound like a racist a Nazi an anti-semite

87
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,880
You know all of the usual overused angles of attack that we've become so entirely

88
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,820
Desensitized to at this point that they've lost all meaning and the rest of the mainstream media along with gaming and tech

89
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,960
Journalists jumped on the bandwagon pewds ended up losing a lucrative business deal with Disney over the invented controversy

90
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,600
But it didn't kill his YouTube channel or slow down his growth as the world's biggest youtuber and in retrospect

91
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:52,800
This seemed like the death rattle of old media lashing out against youtubers and social media for usurping their role in the cultural consciousness

92
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,080
Journalists were starting to figure out that they no longer had the social privilege as a protected class that they once held

93
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,840
But they failed to recognize that a combination of not keeping up with modern technology and trends as well as their own behavior

94
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,200
Had cost them the trust of the public and this blatantly false attack on PewDiePie wasn't the beginning

95
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,000
But just another step down a long path of eroded trust in the institution of journalism

96
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,380
The Wall Street Journal hasn't learned from its misdeeds either a recent trending hashtag trending until Twitter suppressed

97
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,380
It anyway was hashtag

98
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:31,180
wsj kills kids this stems from an event from several weeks ago where a YouTube livestream show called the kill stream ran an event titled

99
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,980
The heel stream where all super chat money raised would be donated to st

100
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,580
Jude's Children's Research Hospital

101
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:43,300
Just like the PewDiePie event the Wall Street Journal saw an opportunity to stick it to both their main competitors and their political opponents

102
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,420
Yuri Co from the Wall Street Journal

103
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,700
Emailed the owner of the kill stream Ethan Ralph in regards to an upcoming story

104
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,740
I am working on a story about how alt-right personalities have utilized YouTube super chat function

105
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:01,020
We're mentioning some of your live streams in the story including one that was aired and deleted in which you spoke about the Pittsburgh shooting

106
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,020
It appears that the live stream generated over

107
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:08,380
$500 via super chat some of the comments both paid and unpaid were problematic

108
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,660
For instance one super chat comment said if you want to know if the synagogue shooting was a false flag

109
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,300
Then check out the lucky Larry life insurance policy on those dead juice

110
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,380
Jesus regarding that live stream. Did you delete it or was that YouTube?

111
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,500
Why we're also mentioning the Ralph retorts live stream from September 29th that raised

112
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,820
$26,000 for st. Jude's I wanted to reach out in case you'd like to comment on any of this

113
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:39,740
I also wanted to confirm that you share the revenue from your super chats with YouTube though Ralph would ultimately refuse Co's request

114
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,940
Here's the article that would come from her efforts hate speech on live super chats tests YouTube

115
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,540
Feature that gives paid comment special treatment generates revenue

116
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:55,320
But can include racist comments and here's a few quotes from this article during the live stream, which YouTube said mr

117
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,340
Ralph has since deleted one user paid two British pounds to write

118
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:06,100
How do you get a Jewish girl's number roll up her sleeve you want to know how despite the media's kicking and screaming they still?

119
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:12,100
Unduly exercise their privileges as a protected class my quoting that joke will likely get this video

120
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:17,260
Demonetized while Yuri Co will still be paid by the Wall Street Journal for the exact same content

121
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,860
YouTube said late on Friday that it had permanently removed. Mr

122
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:27,100
Ralph's channel the Ralph retort from its platform for policy violations and for going against its terms of service. Mr

123
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,100
Ralph whose channel had

124
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:35,700
22,500 subscribers is one of several far-right YouTube celebrities who have used the super chat function to make money Ralph would

125
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,980
Independently confirm this himself on Twitter stating that his super chat button would be disabled for his upcoming live streams on his next

126
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,400
He began to criticize the Wall Street Journal on air and in

127
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,300
retaliation YouTube turned off the stream on their end and suspended all of his channels from the platform a

128
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,780
Spokeswoman for YouTube owned by alphabet inks

129
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:59,580
Google said the company donates to charity the proceeds from any super chats that violate its hate speech policy

130
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
Except they don't because all

131
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:08,380
$26,000 raised by Ralph's stream for st. Jude's is confirmed to have been refunded by YouTube and st

132
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,940
Jude's has also confirmed that they never had any intention of accepting the money both of these revelations came to light

133
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:20,200
Of course after the Wall Street Journal had a private chat with both YouTube and st. Jude's. This is why the hashtag was

134
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,620
Wsj kills kids the Wall Street Journal is willing to deny st

135
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:31,460
Jude's charity funds is willing to twist YouTube into breaking its own rules in order to spite somebody they view as a political opponent in

136
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,860
their eyes money for charity takes a backseat to potentially offensive speech and despite any

137
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:43,780
Personal differences between Ralph and myself on principle. I cannot support his removal from YouTube free speech rights are paramount

138
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,220
Even if the speech in question is hateful or stupid, of course

139
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,100
It's not just the Wall Street Journal committing morally reprehensible acts under the guise of journalism

140
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:59,300
I'm sure we've all heard about blatant racists like Francesca Ramsey and Sarah John moving up the media ranks based on skin color alone

141
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:06,020
And then there's also lesser-known stories like the tale of crosswalk Kathy various progressive leading outlets began to write hit pieces on a private citizen

142
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,580
For calling the cops on a black man for parking improperly with some

143
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,420
SJW is going so far as to doxer and smear her as a racist

144
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,280
But eventually the truth of the matter came out the woman called the parking authority

145
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:23,580
Not the police on a vehicle because it was parked in the middle of a crosswalk and she didn't know the race of the vehicles

146
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,300
owner at all

147
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,540
But since we're on the topic of journalists using their position to attack random citizens guilty of wrongthink

148
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:35,980
There was also that time that CNN blackmailed a random reddit user for making this gif. No, I'm not joking

149
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,020
I did a podcast about it back in the day

150
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,500
But the long and short of it is the moral paragons over at CNN tracked the poster down

151
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:50,180
Accused him of the usual basket of SJW slurs and threatened to reveal his identity if he didn't leave the internet in their self-damning

152
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:56,380
Article titled how CNN found the reddit user behind the Trump wrestling gif CNN is not publishing

153
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,580
Han asshole solos name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology

154
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:07,700
Showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all of his offending posts and because he said he is not going to repeat

155
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,460
This ugly behavior on social media again in addition

156
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,140
He said his statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same

157
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,340
CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change

158
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:25,300
This is why the protected status of journalists is no longer respected by Donald Trump by the conservative wing of politics

159
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,580
By most average people journalists no longer wield that privilege with restraint and wisdom

160
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,620
Instead they use it as a bludgeon against their opponents

161
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:40,340
I could keep going with examples of the media acting ridiculous and irresponsible at best and immoral and corrupt at worst like CNN's

162
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:47,100
Jim Acosta virtue signaling in public over Kanye West saying the word motherfucker in the Oval Office while in private

163
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,680
DMing fuck you to one of his critics on Twitter

164
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,800
But because I am a gamer let me indulge a bit with one final example from the gaming industry

165
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,640
Blizzcon 2018 happened recently and at the event

166
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:06,840
Blizzard took the opportunity to show off their new Diablo game Diablo immortal Diablo is a long-running much beloved PC RPG series

167
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,960
But this latest entry is a phone game on the gaming side of the story

168
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,700
There was a lot of funny stuff going down like the crowd heckling the developers and the developers

169
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:23,260
Exceptionally poor response in return. We want to use mobile devices as the platform for a new

170
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,860
Diablo game

171
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,020
Because nothing brings a family together like slaying demons

172
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:35,160
Hey, just was wondering is this an out-of-season April Fool's joke

173
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,240
No, it's it's a it's a fully

174
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:48,980
Fully fledged Diablo experience on on mobile which everybody will get to play

175
00:15:53,980 --> 00:16:01,380
Is there any plans to make this playable on PC or is this a strictly mobile forever

176
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:07,500
Are there any yeah this the current plan is to be on mobile both?

177
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,940
Android and iOS

178
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,520
We don't have any plans at the moment to do PC

179
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,520
Do

180
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
You guys want have phone yeah you guys

181
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,840
If you want to know more we'll be back here on the mythic stage in just a few minutes

182
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,740
We are gonna have

183
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,720
Sorry

184
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:44,280
Or the company tasking YouTube to delete hundreds of thousands of downvotes and negative comments on the official Diablo immortal reveal trailers

185
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,120
a fact that can be verified by comparing the live numbers to the numbers tracked on social blade or that the response was so

186
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:58,360
overwhelmingly negative to Diablo immortal that all the Diablo social media accounts switched their icons and official branding from the new Diablo immortal stuff

187
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,000
Back to Diablo 3 or that it was discovered by the Internet's greatest autistic minds

188
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,960
The Diablo immortal was outsourced to a Chinese company known for making Diablo mobile ripoffs and that Chinese company simply took one of their

189
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,840
Pre-existing games and

190
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:21,160
Reskinned it with the Diablo brand or Blizzard's main competitors directly making fun of the massive Diablo immortal fumble on social media or that Blizzard

191
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:28,300
Themselves as an April Fool's joke in 2014 announced a Diablo mobile game specifically making fun of how diluted

192
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,400
dumbed down and

193
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:37,060
Disrespectful to existing IPs that phone games can be or that the red shirted bald hero that was willing to stick it to the developers

194
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:43,980
Live not only posted on 4chan asking what he should say before it was his turn but also that his reddit history showed that he

195
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,940
Routinely fucks other women with his wife and threesomes

196
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:54,060
Forget about EA's constant fuck-ups with Star Wars or Microsoft's self-destruction of the Xbox one by claiming that consumers who don't like it can

197
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,620
Just play the Xbox 360

198
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,980
I think blizzards taken the crown on the best way to shotgun yourself in the face

199
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,580
But while that's all good fun

200
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,700
The relevant part is the journalist response to the outrage

201
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:10,900
Diablo immortal is actually fun you entitled babies the people that bash on mobile gaming are an offshoot of toxic masculinity

202
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:17,180
They get off on hating something that they've traditionally associated with a heavily female audience don't like playing a specific kind of game on mobile

203
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:24,020
That's cool. Reject mobile platforms whatsoever and pretend they are inferior. Yeah, that's pretty toxic. This wasn't savagery

204
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,940
It was fucking obnoxious embarrassing behavior. I get why people are mad

205
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:33,260
I really do but you can be critical without being an asshole to people who spend their lives trying to entertain you

206
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:38,540
Of course the first thing I see when I wake up is Diablo immortal haters now saying that Blizzcon was a slap in the face

207
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,260
I roll gif if you can't see the potential of a Diablo game on mobile

208
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:47,460
You know shit all about video games the reaction to Diablo eternal. You got that wrong there champ

209
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,460
Don't expect any Blizzard shill shekels the reaction to Diablo eternal from so many

210
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:58,540
Gamers makes me want to not play video games or have anything to do with gaming anymore fans react to Diablo immortal like

211
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:04,140
Disrespectful edgelords hot take after hot take shill after shill virtue signal after virtue signal

212
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:10,060
Assertions that gamers are man-babies demands that consumers blindly purchase whatever companies give them

213
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:17,920
Accusations that complainers are ungrateful because they dislike a product not having learned a single goddamn thing from gamergate lefty games journalists

214
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:25,660
Demonize their own audience ignore the legitimate arguments against Diablo immortal inside with the 83 billion dollar company over the concerns of an average

215
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:32,100
Person and should you one of those average people decide to call them out on this you'll be contributing to Trump's demonization of the media

216
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,100
You'll be vilifying journalism

217
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:39,300
You'll be disrespecting the journalists rightful place as a protected class alongside women and minorities

218
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,020
But the journalist is not a protected class

219
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:47,100
Maybe in an ideal world due to the nature of the job that a good journalist should perform

220
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,460
Maybe they should be somewhat protected exposing corrupt governments or corporations speaking truth to power

221
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,900
Uncovering scandals and holding people accountable

222
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,020
These are the jobs of the journalist and these are the jobs that we need to see done

223
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,060
Society is better as a whole when a good journalist is successful

224
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:08,220
But none of the journalists anymore seem to be good from something as benign as video games all the way up to the White House

225
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,020
Journalists have decided that their job is no longer to report on events

226
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:18,060
But to create the context of those events that people they look down upon must be obligated to consume. Why is this happened?

227
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:24,580
I don't know. Maybe it's because social justice controls both academia and entertainment right now and the long-term results of that

228
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,340
Is that SJW kids from 10 or 15 years ago are now SJW journalists today?

229
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,780
Maybe it's because as multiple articles in

230
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:39,260
2017 pointed out with glee new studies have shown that journalists brains function at lower levels in the average persons due to an excess

231
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,220
consumption of alcohol caffeine and sugar rendering them unable to think objectively

232
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,060
multitask problem-solve or be creative in any case

233
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,500
Journalists are not a protected class as long as they behave

234
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:56,380
So grotesquely we can never accept them as one if they want the privilege of social protection in order to do their dangerous work

235
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:01,420
They need to actually start doing that work again until then. They're simply fake news

236
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,060
You
