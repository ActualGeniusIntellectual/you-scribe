00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
This video is not meant to be a statement of absolute fact, nor does it exist to directly

00:04.640 --> 00:06.120
accuse anybody of anything.

00:06.120 --> 00:09.600
Rather, it's a presentation of the evidence that we've discovered and an open call for

00:09.600 --> 00:13.840
others on both the inside and out to discuss the issues explored therein.

00:13.840 --> 00:18.760
Furthermore, any audio accompanied by the Devon no-talent gaming artwork can be considered

00:18.760 --> 00:21.760
to be entirely our own opinion or conjecture on a topic.

00:21.760 --> 00:22.600
Thank you and enjoy!

00:30.000 --> 00:38.320
Hey guys, Dev here.

00:38.320 --> 00:42.540
I hope you all enjoyed the April Fools video, I'm sorry this one's a bit later than usual,

00:42.540 --> 00:46.280
we actually had it finished by Saturday, but camera lady's computer shit out on her for

00:46.280 --> 00:47.280
a few days.

00:47.280 --> 00:51.680
I hope you've all seen our video on the IGDA, because this serves as an unofficial sequel

00:51.680 --> 00:52.680
to it.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.580
After our video dropped, we received the usual backlash.

00:55.580 --> 00:59.880
People inside who are clearly anti-Gamergate, simply calling us misogynists and whatever

00:59.880 --> 01:02.320
for daring to question the current power structure.

01:02.320 --> 01:06.880
But camera lady got to talking with one notable individual on the inside who wasn't actually

01:06.880 --> 01:10.600
interested in baselessly slinging mud, and his name was Derek Smart.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.720
Now Derek's no stranger to gamergate.

01:12.720 --> 01:17.040
Earlier this month some info surfaced regarding the IGDA's head, Kate Edwards.

01:17.040 --> 01:20.780
She's trans, and was known as Tom Edwards before her transition.

01:20.780 --> 01:25.840
I want to make this absolutely clear, this is not about Kate being trans.

01:25.840 --> 01:30.920
I bring this up solely to show that she performed actions when she was known as Tom, that have

01:30.920 --> 01:33.260
bearings on her current business as Kate.

01:33.260 --> 01:37.660
Any comment or criticism directed towards Kate has nothing to do with her status as

01:37.660 --> 01:38.740
a trans woman.

01:38.740 --> 01:43.740
As Tom Edwards, she founded her own consulting firm, Englobe, which later had its name changed

01:43.740 --> 01:44.860
to Geografie.

01:44.860 --> 01:48.700
As Kate Edwards, she became the executive director of the IGDA.

01:48.700 --> 01:54.580
Geografie, the consulting firm Kate Edwards owns, is contracted to do consulting for the

01:54.580 --> 01:57.980
IGDA, the organization Kate Edwards currently heads up.

01:57.980 --> 02:02.260
This seems like a very obvious conflict of interest, with the well-known gamergate lawyer

02:02.260 --> 02:04.820
Mike Cernovich saying it sounds illegal.

02:04.820 --> 02:05.940
And here's where Derek Smart comes in.

02:05.940 --> 02:10.300
Derek wrote a reply to both our video and this new information regarding Kate Edwards

02:10.300 --> 02:11.300
owning Geografie.

02:11.300 --> 02:13.340
Let me go over a few important bits.

02:13.340 --> 02:17.820
Derek says he listens to both sides of gamergate and tries to have reasonable discourse.

02:17.820 --> 02:20.940
Based on his conversation with Camera Lady, I'd say that's the truth.

02:20.940 --> 02:26.260
He's equally welcoming and critical to both gamergate supporters and anti-GGers and seems

02:26.260 --> 02:28.180
to be willing to talk to just about anybody.

02:28.180 --> 02:33.620
Derek says, in more words, that his experiences with the IGDA have shown him that they're

02:33.620 --> 02:34.620
on the level.

02:34.620 --> 02:39.300
Derek discusses the Geografie claims, stating that given the seriousness and nature of the

02:39.300 --> 02:43.780
allegations and knowing that nobody was going to respond, I took it upon myself to get to

02:43.780 --> 02:44.820
the bottom of it.

02:44.820 --> 02:49.900
If Kate Edwards was one woman holding two positions, who got hired to those two positions

02:49.900 --> 02:54.900
independently of her involvement in the other, and then afterwards suddenly the IGDA is doing

02:54.900 --> 02:58.740
business with Geografie, that would be illegal.

02:58.740 --> 03:04.820
But Derek says that Kate is not actually employed by the IGDA, but rather she is employed by

03:04.820 --> 03:09.260
Geografie and is contracted out to the IGDA as its chairman.

03:09.260 --> 03:13.300
I've personally seen this happen a lot in multiple industries, where a worker will be

03:13.300 --> 03:18.300
employed by a firm that exists specifically to rent workers out to other companies.

03:18.300 --> 03:22.820
A simple way to describe this is like so, Kate doesn't hold positions of power in

03:22.820 --> 03:27.980
both Geografie and the IGDA, and she doesn't use that to funnel money from one to the other.

03:27.980 --> 03:32.920
Kate holds a position of power in Geografie, and the IGDA pays Geografie for Kate to also

03:32.920 --> 03:36.100
hold a position of power and manage the IGDA.

03:36.100 --> 03:40.220
Her management is literally what the IGDA is paying Geografie for.

03:40.380 --> 03:43.740
Now Derek doesn't offer any proof of his claims, but I honestly don't think he's

03:43.740 --> 03:44.740
able to.

03:44.740 --> 03:48.580
He's not going to have access to Kate Edwards contract, and even if he did I doubt he'd

03:48.580 --> 03:49.940
legally be able to publish it.

03:49.940 --> 03:53.620
Is it possible that Derek's lying, or was misinformed by the people he spoke to to get

03:53.620 --> 03:54.620
his information?

03:54.620 --> 03:55.620
Sure.

03:55.620 --> 03:59.100
But the fact that he is one of the only people with any connections that has been consistently

03:59.100 --> 04:03.780
open minded and reasonable makes me want to trust him, and I'm also not willing to completely

04:03.780 --> 04:08.340
backstab and alienate a guy because I have a predetermined outcome regarding the IGDA

04:08.340 --> 04:09.620
and his reply doesn't fit it.

04:09.620 --> 04:13.580
We can't ask for insiders to come forward and then accuse them of lying or covering

04:13.580 --> 04:16.880
things up when they give us answers we don't want to hear.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.060
Not without proof.

04:18.060 --> 04:22.340
If Derek's either lying or misinformed, then Kate Edwards is actually doing some pretty

04:22.340 --> 04:23.340
corrupt shit.

04:23.340 --> 04:27.780
Kate would be in a position to move money from the non-profit IGDA to her own personal

04:27.780 --> 04:28.780
company.

04:28.780 --> 04:32.180
And even if Kate's entirely on the level, the fact that her company was given the contract

04:32.180 --> 04:36.020
over others that may be just as capable is corruption in itself.

04:36.020 --> 04:40.540
However, if Derek's correct, and I think he is, then what he has to say lines up with

04:40.540 --> 04:46.060
the anonymous indie dev from the last video that claimed Kate and the IGDA isn't corrupt,

04:46.060 --> 04:47.060
but just a bit flip-floppy.

04:47.060 --> 04:51.380
However, even with Derek telling the truth, I do think there's a bit of a problem with

04:51.380 --> 04:53.140
Geogrify, even if it's only a minor one.

04:53.140 --> 04:57.700
Geogrify does consulting for not only the IGDA, but also several games studios.

04:57.700 --> 05:01.220
I'm not sure if it's appropriate for the same company to have its hands in the management

05:01.220 --> 05:05.420
of both the studios and the organization that exists to stand up for the rights of those

05:05.420 --> 05:09.560
studios' employees, but this seems to be minor and is nothing like any sort of money

05:09.560 --> 05:11.600
funneling that we all initially thought.

05:11.600 --> 05:16.740
As for the IGDA's connection to UBM's other properties like the IGF and GDC, Derek and

05:16.740 --> 05:20.620
Camera actually agree that the connections looked bad, but having the potential for something

05:20.620 --> 05:24.960
to go wrong is not the same as something actually going wrong, and Derek wants to default to

05:24.960 --> 05:28.260
trust the people running things until they prove they can't be trusted.

05:28.260 --> 05:32.920
At the same time, Derek admitted to knowing nothing about the IGF side of the equation,

05:32.920 --> 05:34.220
as he doesn't deal with them.

05:34.220 --> 05:39.420
Even if the IGDA is completely innocent, IGF has more than enough corrupt bullshit happening

05:39.420 --> 05:42.580
inside to cover the entire UBM family anyway.

05:42.580 --> 05:45.980
A little while back, Alistair Pinsauf gave an interview on TechRaptor regarding what

05:45.980 --> 05:47.560
he knows about the IGF.

05:47.560 --> 05:51.540
He says that a lot of what we had initially dug up was somewhat inaccurate, but there

05:51.540 --> 05:55.500
was enough truth there that he had to take a hard look back at his own experiences and

05:55.500 --> 05:58.540
felt a moral imperative to come forward and share what he had witnessed.

05:58.540 --> 06:01.740
I think his assessment of our video is fair.

06:01.740 --> 06:03.260
We're not industry insiders.

06:03.260 --> 06:07.420
Our lady is just a near-mute autist who is good at digging up info, and I can only read

06:07.420 --> 06:08.420
what she gives me.

06:08.420 --> 06:12.060
We can only go off of what we managed to sleuth up from the underbelly of the internet.

06:12.060 --> 06:14.300
However, the video achieved its goal.

06:14.300 --> 06:18.180
It got the gears turning inside the brains of many people inside the industry.

06:18.180 --> 06:23.660
Indies, journalists, and judges have all come out both publicly and privately to say, something

06:23.660 --> 06:27.300
fucked up happened with me during the IGF and I didn't think much of it until I saw

06:27.300 --> 06:29.580
your video, and that's what we hoped would happen.

06:29.580 --> 06:32.540
The truth of it is, we can't do much.

06:32.540 --> 06:35.780
We can boycott sites and encourage others to do the same.

06:35.780 --> 06:39.980
We can refuse to pay for games or refuse to play them, but reforming the IGF is only going

06:39.980 --> 06:44.160
to happen if the indie devs who enter the IGF come together and demand it.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.820
And we want IGF reform just as much as you do.

06:46.820 --> 06:51.260
Not just so that undeserving games stop getting awards and therefore stop getting press coverage,

06:51.260 --> 06:55.260
but also for every single indie developer who pays to enter the IGF not knowing that

06:55.260 --> 06:58.500
they have no chance at winning regardless of the quality of their game, just because

06:58.500 --> 07:00.180
they're not friends with the right people.

07:00.180 --> 07:05.420
For the indie devs who want to speak out, who have seen injustices but fear retaliation.

07:05.420 --> 07:08.780
For people like the anonymous indie dev we mentioned in the last video that spoke to

07:08.780 --> 07:12.620
Camera Lady, who provided us with a major lead regarding the IGF.

07:12.620 --> 07:17.540
They said to look into winners who were judges before they were winners.

07:17.540 --> 07:20.560
Camera Lady mentioned the only reason that she and her friends had been able to show

07:20.560 --> 07:25.100
judges being connected to winners was due to the Polytron leaked financial documents,

07:25.100 --> 07:27.580
and without that knowledge it would be harder to do.

07:27.580 --> 07:32.300
But the indie devs said not to look at years where a judge won a game in the same year,

07:32.300 --> 07:35.180
but to find winners who were judges in all other years.

07:35.180 --> 07:41.020
In essence, there's a group of indie devs that double as judges in the IGF every single

07:41.020 --> 07:44.260
year except the years in which they enter a game.

07:44.260 --> 07:47.780
And when a member of that group steps out of the judge pool in a given year to enter

07:47.780 --> 07:51.680
a game, the other members of the group push that game through.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.580
And the next year, the judge who received a boost last time around returns to the judge

07:55.580 --> 07:58.340
pool to help push another member through.

07:58.340 --> 08:02.840
Now I'd like to define some terms from the IGF itself using a statement they wrote in

08:02.840 --> 08:04.620
reply to our original video.

08:04.620 --> 08:08.540
In it, the difference between judge and juror is spelled out.

08:08.540 --> 08:13.900
The judges are anonymous, and as of the latest IGF, number at approximately 375.

08:13.900 --> 08:17.580
They're given a random selection of games to judge, but are also able to vote on any

08:17.580 --> 08:19.380
other game in the pool that they'd like.

08:19.380 --> 08:23.940
And although they don't say this in the statement, it's been confirmed by several other sources,

08:23.940 --> 08:28.620
some we even used in the previous video, that it only takes a total of 8 years for

08:28.620 --> 08:30.580
a game to move to the next round.

08:30.580 --> 08:33.020
Meanwhile, the jurors are not anonymous.

08:33.020 --> 08:38.320
Their announcement happens annually with some fanfare, almost as if they're considered celebrities.

08:38.320 --> 08:42.420
And each juror is assigned to a specific award with the task of deciding the finalists and

08:42.420 --> 08:46.340
ultimately the winner of that award from the pool of games that the judges all recommend

08:46.340 --> 08:47.500
from the previous round.

08:47.500 --> 08:51.760
In another statement, this time announcing the resignation of Maddy Brice, the IGF confirms

08:51.760 --> 08:56.360
that a single individual can be both a judge and juror in the same year, by describing

08:56.360 --> 08:59.720
her as performing both of these duties before leaving the IGF.

08:59.720 --> 09:04.200
There's an obvious problem right away, if a game is already well known, it doesn't take

09:04.200 --> 09:08.880
much for 8 judges to peruse the list, find the famous game, and give it an upvote.

09:08.880 --> 09:12.360
Moreover, it's also no problem for 8 judges to come together and push a game through the

09:12.360 --> 09:13.980
system regardless of its quality.

09:13.980 --> 09:17.680
This is one of the reasons why Maddy Brice's infamous tweet describing her personal voting

09:17.680 --> 09:22.840
metric as downvoting all games with men in them was considered to be extremely corrupt.

09:22.840 --> 09:27.960
In any case, this gave us an obvious way forward, find the IGF judge and juror lists, see who

09:27.960 --> 09:32.100
consistently judges every year except the years in which they enter a game, and see

09:32.100 --> 09:35.480
if they consistently win awards every time they step out to enter.

09:35.480 --> 09:38.520
It's not conclusive proof, but it's certainly a start.

09:38.520 --> 09:43.280
Despite the IGF judges being considered anonymous nowadays, it wasn't always so.

09:43.280 --> 09:48.040
The IGF used to publish their judge lists alongside their jury lists, specifically at

09:48.040 --> 09:53.320
the URL www.igf.com slash judges.html.

09:53.320 --> 09:57.340
This is relevant because each year, the judge list for that year would be published at the

09:57.340 --> 10:01.920
exact same HTML file, overwriting the previous year's judge list.

10:01.920 --> 10:05.920
Using the magical powers of the internet wayback machine, it actually becomes relatively easy

10:05.920 --> 10:10.040
to catalog each year's judge list, all right from the same address.

10:10.040 --> 10:18.120
The judge lists archived from www.igf.com slash judges.html are from 2006 to 2009.

10:18.120 --> 10:21.280
But from 2010 onward, there's nothing but dead pages.

10:21.280 --> 10:25.720
Camberlady began cataloging all of the judges into a spreadsheet to see when recurring judges

10:25.720 --> 10:29.480
stepped away for a year, with the intention to cross-reference their stepping back with

10:29.480 --> 10:32.000
the awards winners and finalists for that year.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.280
But those missing judge lists from 2010 onward put a damper on the whole endeavor, don't

10:36.280 --> 10:37.280
they?

10:37.280 --> 10:42.680
Well here's some info at www.igf.com slash 2011juries.html.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.160
But this seems a bit different, doesn't it?

10:44.160 --> 10:46.760
People are grouped by awards and given extensive bios.

10:46.760 --> 10:51.480
Ah, right, that would be because this is the juror list, not the judge list.

10:51.480 --> 10:56.440
Remember, after 2011, the judge list had become private, and the jury list is released every

10:56.440 --> 10:58.000
year with fanfare.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.680
But from the IGF statement on Mati Bryce, we do know that many anonymous judges are

11:01.680 --> 11:03.440
also public jurors.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.320
There's still something odd about this though.

11:05.360 --> 11:08.840
If you go to the public judge list back on the Internet Wayback Machine, you'll see

11:08.840 --> 11:12.200
that they're collectively called the competition jury rather than judges.

11:12.200 --> 11:15.560
Man, it's almost like the IGF just keeps shuffling their terminology around in order

11:15.560 --> 11:16.560
to confuse people.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.080
Well, maybe this'll help.

11:18.080 --> 11:21.320
In depth, demystifying the IGF judging process.

11:21.320 --> 11:27.080
This was posted on IGF.com in January 2010 and was written by Jens Bergensten, otherwise

11:27.080 --> 11:29.240
known as Jeb of Minecraft fam.

11:29.240 --> 11:34.240
Now Jeb talks about being a judge in the current IGF, which was 2010 at the time, as well as

11:34.240 --> 11:38.800
previous years, and that he's never gotten the luxury of a nomination at this point.

11:38.800 --> 11:44.760
Well, the very next year, 2011, Jeb's game, Cobalt, gets nominated for Excellence in Audio

11:44.760 --> 11:45.760
at the IGF.

11:45.760 --> 11:49.880
And in 2012, Jeb tweets that he's been assigned to judge at the IGF again.

11:49.880 --> 11:55.240
And again in 2013, Jeb tweets about his experience judging for the IGF, and how he finds the

11:55.240 --> 11:58.960
good entries, sort by number of judge comments.

11:58.960 --> 12:03.600
This does lend credence to Camera Lady's initial theory that well-known games, or developers,

12:03.600 --> 12:08.760
aka those within the clique, entering the IGF have an inherent advantage over any kind

12:08.760 --> 12:13.280
of new, truly indie dev, and that all it would take to force a game to the top of the pile

12:13.280 --> 12:16.040
is a small number of judges coming together to give it a push.

12:16.040 --> 12:19.460
I didn't even bring up Jeb with the intention of actually looking into him, but he fits

12:19.460 --> 12:23.280
the bill of the rotating cabal of judges theory the anonymous dev put forward.

12:23.280 --> 12:31.240
Jeb is a judge in the IGF in 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013, only skipping out on 2011 because

12:31.240 --> 12:32.800
he had entered Cobalt.

12:32.800 --> 12:37.760
And would you look at that, Cobalt got to advertise that it was an IGF finalist.

12:37.760 --> 12:40.600
Jesus Christ, let me actually get to where I was going.

12:40.600 --> 12:46.620
In Jeb's writing, he describes the differences between IGF 2009 and IGF 2010.

12:46.620 --> 12:51.360
Starting in 2010, there was a nouveau category that judges could nominate games to via a

12:51.360 --> 12:56.380
yes or no, which does potentially contradict what was written in the Maggie Bryce piece

12:56.380 --> 12:59.300
regarding there being no downvoting in the judging process.

12:59.300 --> 13:02.780
There were 150 judges in 2010, and they were anonymous.

13:02.780 --> 13:05.720
You could only see the name of another judge if they commented on a game.

13:05.720 --> 13:10.160
But Jeb says something of note, I was only allowed to score the games in my list, but

13:10.160 --> 13:14.000
I could try the other games if I liked so I could gain perspective on the quality of

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
those titles.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.920
It was also possible for me to write comments on the games.

13:17.920 --> 13:22.260
This goes completely against what multiple sources have said that any judge can vote

13:22.260 --> 13:23.260
on any game.

13:23.260 --> 13:28.220
Jeb also talks about the finalist judging back in 2010, saying, following all of the

13:28.220 --> 13:33.080
first round judging, the IGF judges have about a month to play all the finalists and

13:33.080 --> 13:35.060
simply vote for their winner in each category.

13:35.060 --> 13:39.760
No mention of a public division between anonymous judges and publicized jurors.

13:39.760 --> 13:43.680
These are two interesting inconsistencies, which I want to address a bit later in the

13:43.680 --> 13:44.680
video.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.900
Alex May offers a second opinion in Jeb's piece.

13:46.900 --> 13:51.260
He outright admits to being a judge in 2010 and a finalist in 2009, thanks for saving

13:51.260 --> 13:56.020
camera some time there bro, and just like with Jeb, easily found tweets and articles

13:56.020 --> 14:00.040
confirming he was also a judge and juror in 2011, 2012, and 2013.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.980
Alex May admits to having approximately two days per game assigned to him, but decided

14:03.980 --> 14:07.300
to leave it all until the last minute, and that based on the activity of the private

14:07.300 --> 14:10.440
judging website, most other judges did the same.

14:10.440 --> 14:14.180
This lines up with the Rotten Cartridges blog post, where an entrant describes how most

14:14.180 --> 14:18.020
judges assigned to their game didn't actually play it, and how only one judge played it

14:18.020 --> 14:21.820
for more than five minutes, and how he only received a response from the IGF after he

14:21.820 --> 14:23.760
threatened to go public with the information.

14:23.760 --> 14:27.560
The third opinion is written by Michael Rose, and to give him credit, he seems to do the

14:27.560 --> 14:28.880
right thing.

14:28.880 --> 14:32.680
He decided that the only way he was going to judge this list of games fairly was if

14:32.680 --> 14:36.680
he played them from top to bottom, not picking out the ones I had already come across or

14:36.680 --> 14:38.480
was previously excited to play.

14:38.480 --> 14:42.840
The piece ends off with a word from Simon Carlos, the IGF chairman back in January of

14:42.840 --> 14:44.220
2010.

14:44.220 --> 14:48.720
He says, since the independent games festival is becoming so important to many small game

14:48.720 --> 14:53.560
developers' lives, we're committed to transparency because we know that indie game creators

14:53.560 --> 14:57.640
want to understand what is happening to their game in the process of IGF judging.

14:57.640 --> 15:00.280
Of course, the IGF is no stranger to criticism.

15:00.280 --> 15:04.200
It's not just Cameron Lady's digs, or the Rotten Cartridges blog post, or Team Meat's

15:04.200 --> 15:07.440
podcast where they describe their judging experience being a complete shit show, or

15:07.440 --> 15:11.120
Alistair Pynsoff, or any of the others who were inspired to step forward and talk after

15:11.120 --> 15:12.180
a video is dropped.

15:12.180 --> 15:16.360
The criticism goes back a long way, and used to actually come from the people that now

15:16.360 --> 15:19.280
devoutly describe themselves as Gamergate's opposition.

15:19.280 --> 15:24.760
Rock Paper Shotgun's Brandon Caldwell published The Story Behind the IGF's Critics, and in

15:24.760 --> 15:28.600
it he talks to a developer and vocal IGF critic, Anna Anthropy.

15:28.600 --> 15:34.240
Yes, the same Anna Anthropy whose personal friends, Patricia Hernandez and Lea Alexander,

15:34.240 --> 15:36.600
wrote about without disclosing their friendships.

15:36.600 --> 15:41.760
The same Anna Anthropy who is vehemently anti-Gamergate, and is in fact one of the corrupt individuals

15:41.760 --> 15:45.920
GG investigated, was once vocal in her criticisms of the IGF.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.560
The article talks about a pirate cart.

15:47.560 --> 15:51.240
A large number of indie games all entered into the IGF as one game because they were

15:51.240 --> 15:54.760
all contained within the same larger game, like in Action 52.

15:54.760 --> 15:59.180
The article states that some see this as a protest against the IGF's unfit rules and

15:59.180 --> 16:00.360
high entry fees.

16:00.360 --> 16:04.600
Anna herself says it was definitely a reaction to Fez winning the grand prize at the IGF

16:04.600 --> 16:05.600
two separate years.

16:05.600 --> 16:09.240
It raised a lot of awareness both of these games that would never have been so widely

16:09.240 --> 16:12.920
played if the pirate cart hadn't existed, and also just for the fact that the IGF is

16:12.920 --> 16:13.920
bullshit.

16:13.920 --> 16:19.640
It goes on to say, the fact that Fez can have already won an IGF award and now is nominated

16:19.640 --> 16:23.360
for two other awards, including the grand prize, I think it's a really good reminder

16:23.360 --> 16:27.360
that the IGF is all about cliqueyness, the scene-sters that I yell about, the fact that

16:27.360 --> 16:30.440
it's about the established quote unquote indie scene.

16:30.440 --> 16:34.760
Here is not only what we've been saying, but what many indie devs have been saying since

16:34.760 --> 16:39.520
Gamergate began, straight from the mouth of Gamergate's opposition years ago.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.440
Phil Fish himself even decides to step up to the plate.

16:42.440 --> 16:47.000
He says that, after asking Brandon Boye about it, and being told the game had changed enough

16:47.000 --> 16:48.880
to allow re-entry, he did so.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.000
Fish describes the current IGF thusly.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.520
The IGF wants the biggest, best games to enter.

16:53.520 --> 16:57.440
They don't want the best developers to sit it out and be like, oh, we're too good and

16:57.440 --> 16:58.440
this is the kids' table.

16:58.440 --> 17:01.320
They really hate that kind of conception that the IGF is a scholarship.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.420
It kind of used to be.

17:02.420 --> 17:03.420
It got us started.

17:03.420 --> 17:06.880
It got the attention of publishers and it got us the Microsoft deal, but that's just

17:06.880 --> 17:07.880
a bonus.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.160
So, what can we take away from this?

17:10.160 --> 17:12.240
That the IGF doesn't want to be indie anymore?

17:12.240 --> 17:15.740
I mean, it's certainly not a place for AAA developers, but it's pretty obvious what's

17:15.740 --> 17:16.800
being said here.

17:16.800 --> 17:20.400
There is now a divide between developing a game out of your basement indie and owning

17:20.400 --> 17:24.640
your own game studio indie, and it's very clear which of the two groups make up the

17:24.640 --> 17:31.280
judges, jurors, IGF staff, IGF winners, IGF finalists, and ultimately who the IGF wants

17:31.280 --> 17:32.280
at the top.

17:32.280 --> 17:35.880
We have consistently said that indie is just not indie anymore.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.240
It's become its own institution and bureaucracy.

17:38.240 --> 17:43.980
And Phil Fish, being interviewed by a fucking rock-paper-shotgun of all outlets, is confirming

17:43.980 --> 17:45.560
everything we've been saying.

17:45.560 --> 17:50.280
I honestly recommend you read the entire article, because there's just way too much both Phil

17:50.280 --> 17:52.740
Fish and Anna Anthropy say to cover here.

17:52.740 --> 17:57.000
But they parrot everything we've been saying for the past eight months about the IGF, with

17:57.000 --> 18:02.200
Phil even going so far as to say, yeah, all my coworkers and friends are judges, and Brandon

18:02.200 --> 18:05.160
Boy is my friend too, but it's totally not what it seems.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.160
It's fucking surreal.

18:06.160 --> 18:10.880
And as a cherry on top, check out Ed McMillan from Team Meat, and his wife Danielle chatting

18:10.880 --> 18:38.240
about the whole thing while playing Binding

22:08.240 --> 22:34.720
And then there's David Rosen of Humble Bundle fame, who is very anti-gamergate, sparing

22:34.720 --> 22:39.760
no opportunity to call us all misogynists, dig into Total Biscuit, shill for Arthur Chu,

22:39.760 --> 22:41.420
the whole nine yards.

22:41.420 --> 22:46.360
And here he is in 2009, bringing up many of these issues with the IGF, issues that have

22:46.360 --> 22:47.840
only grown since then.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.000
Let's do a quick recap.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.760
Jeb reveals that, back in 2010, judges vote on games, and those same judges then again

22:53.760 --> 22:55.760
vote on the finalists to decide a winner.

22:55.760 --> 23:00.440
In a post titled, Letter from the Chairman, explaining IGF's changes for 2011, the new

23:00.440 --> 23:04.200
system of anonymous judges and specialist jurors is revealed.

23:04.200 --> 23:08.400
Jeb also notes that he can only vote on the games he was given, when we know for a fact

23:08.400 --> 23:11.080
that judges nowadays can vote on any game they like.

23:11.080 --> 23:16.560
From 2006 to 2009, the internet wayback machine has a record of the IGF posting full public

23:16.560 --> 23:17.560
judge lists.

23:17.560 --> 23:23.560
This stops with IGF 2010, and going forward only public jury lists are posted, with their

23:23.560 --> 23:28.520
reveals being treated almost like reality TV show twists by Gamasutra, the news outlet

23:28.520 --> 23:31.080
owned by the IGF's parent company, UBM.

23:31.080 --> 23:35.320
People who were vehemently anti-gamergate, both developers and journalists, were once

23:35.320 --> 23:39.160
completely willing to criticize and investigate the IGF's conduct.

23:39.160 --> 23:40.160
But now?

23:40.160 --> 23:44.600
Not just radio silence from almost everybody, but directed attacks towards journalists and

23:44.600 --> 23:46.920
developers who speak out against the IGF.

23:46.920 --> 23:51.760
It's like a giant switch was flipped at around mid 2010 inside the IGF.

23:51.760 --> 23:57.000
New judging systems were set in place, oversight was slowly dismantled, lists of contributors

23:57.000 --> 24:00.560
were hidden away, and the people who should have been speaking out louder than ever all

24:00.560 --> 24:02.200
suddenly shut up.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.440
What the fuck happened?

24:03.440 --> 24:06.060
Well, I'll tell you what happened.

24:06.060 --> 24:11.600
One of the last public acts of Simon Carlos, the former chairman of the IGF, was to write

24:11.600 --> 24:17.160
the ending paragraph of Jeb's post talking about how committed the IGF was to transparency,

24:17.160 --> 24:19.000
back in January of 2010.

24:19.000 --> 24:25.880
In May of that same year, our good friend Brandon Boye replaced Carlos as the IGF chairman,

24:25.880 --> 24:28.140
and he has remained in that position to this day.

24:28.140 --> 24:32.820
In Brandon's first, message from the chairman post, he ends it by saying, in the coming

24:32.820 --> 24:37.140
weeks and months, I'll be laying out some of the ways that will be modifying and improving

24:37.140 --> 24:39.020
the way the festival operates.

24:39.020 --> 24:43.780
And the very next post on the site is a description of the new system that allows any judge to

24:43.780 --> 24:47.340
vote for any game, and keeps judge lists private.

24:47.340 --> 24:49.540
What the fuck happened?

24:49.540 --> 24:51.460
Brandon Boye became chair.

24:51.460 --> 24:56.220
Now in Alistair Pynsoff's interview on TechRaptor, he too has a lot to say about Brandon.

24:56.220 --> 25:01.540
Pynsoff says, here's a guy who runs multiple award shows, runs sites that promotes indies,

25:01.540 --> 25:07.140
is friends with devs, PR, all media types, and here he is on the Game Journal Pro's group.

25:07.140 --> 25:12.080
To Brandon's credit, it does make sense that he was there, as he was a journalist before

25:12.080 --> 25:14.020
becoming IGF chair.

25:14.020 --> 25:18.180
But he was chairman after 2010, and leaked emails from the mailing list show that he

25:18.180 --> 25:22.460
didn't leave, nor did he remain silent within the list after becoming chairman.

25:22.460 --> 25:24.660
Pynsoff seems to share our opinion on Brandon.

25:24.660 --> 25:29.500
He says, I think Boye is a good guy at heart, but money and power have a way of changing

25:29.500 --> 25:30.500
things.

25:30.500 --> 25:35.020
I'd like to see him and the IGF investigated and better governed in years to come so people

25:35.020 --> 25:38.600
outside Boye's inner circle of investors are given a fair shake.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.740
I wholeheartedly agree with this.

25:40.740 --> 25:44.300
There's not enough evidence to say that Brandon Boye was the undisputed direct cause of all

25:44.300 --> 25:48.740
the corruption in the IGF, but in my opinion, there is enough evidence to show a pattern

25:48.740 --> 25:53.940
of changing rules and behaviours that seem to benefit Boye and his friends disproportionately.

25:53.980 --> 25:58.620
I don't buy that it's a simple coincidence that after Boye arrives in the scene, rules

25:58.620 --> 26:03.340
are changed that allow his friends' games to win finalist nominations and awards, all

26:03.340 --> 26:08.420
the while the IGF's loudest critics suddenly go silent as one of their own, a fellow journalist,

26:08.420 --> 26:09.620
ascends the throne.

26:09.620 --> 26:13.420
Brandon Boye's ethically shaky actions seem to extend beyond the IGF as well.

26:13.420 --> 26:17.780
In Alistair Pynsoff's interview, he mentions talking to Tiff Chow in 2011, who bragged

26:17.780 --> 26:21.940
that her boyfriend, Steph Therrien, would win Fantastic Arcade's Best Game Award, another

26:21.940 --> 26:26.400
award show that Brandon Boye runs, due to Steph and Brandon's friendship.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.860
And sure enough, Steph's game won.

26:28.860 --> 26:33.980
However, on a follow-up article on Kotaku, Tiff denies ever saying that, and Kotaku considered

26:33.980 --> 26:34.980
the matter closed.

26:34.980 --> 26:37.820
Well, that's some quality reporting work there, Totelo.

26:37.820 --> 26:42.080
When you were earning your masters in journalism, which professor taught you that a he-said-she-said

26:42.080 --> 26:44.460
scenario was proof enough for you to drop a subject?

26:44.460 --> 26:47.700
Well don't worry about it, Steven, camera lady did the work for you.

26:47.700 --> 26:51.080
Around the same time as Brandon was running the Fantastic Arcade's award show that Steph

26:51.080 --> 26:56.000
would later win, he also wrote a number of articles on the website Offworld, promoting

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Steph's games.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.160
Gamergate will know Offworld as the website Lea Alexander relocated her megaphone to after

27:01.160 --> 27:05.080
she gracefully resigned from Gamasutra, of entirely her own accord, I'm sure.

27:05.080 --> 27:09.080
A large number of social media posts show Brandon and Steph are friends as well, the

27:09.080 --> 27:14.760
posts going far beyond normal industry chatter and discussing dinners, concerts, casual hanging

27:14.760 --> 27:18.680
out, collaborating on projects, and explicit declarations of friendship.

27:18.680 --> 27:22.600
And all of this stuff doesn't only apply to Brandon and Steph's friendship, either.

27:22.600 --> 27:26.200
Just looking at Brandon's Offworld articles uncovers a massive amount of conflicts of

27:26.200 --> 27:27.200
interest.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.720
Here's one of his articles, 20 Games You Shouldn't Miss in 2014.

27:30.720 --> 27:35.680
Of those 20, five games were made by individuals that can be proven to be Brandon's personal

27:35.680 --> 27:36.680
friends.

27:36.680 --> 27:40.880
Fjords by Kyle Reimergarten, HoHoCum by Honey Slug, which his friend Ricky Haggit works

27:40.880 --> 27:46.720
for, How Do You Do It? by Nina Freeman, Pale Machine by Ben Esposito, and Sports Friends

27:46.720 --> 27:51.520
by Dai Goot Fabric, which his friend Douglas Wilson works for.

27:51.520 --> 27:54.880
Recommending their games isn't necessarily a conflict of interest, however recommending

27:54.880 --> 27:58.560
their games and not disclosing friendships with the developers is.

27:58.560 --> 28:01.720
And this really is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Brandon Boye.

28:01.720 --> 28:05.960
Camera Lady cut her investigation of Brandon's time at Offworld short, mainly because this

28:05.960 --> 28:09.600
video is already coming out late and she wanted me to record this as soon as possible.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.840
But it seems like everything he sticks his fingers into becomes corrupt.

28:12.840 --> 28:18.520
The IGF, Fantastic Arcade, his lack of disclosure in his writing, hell even in Indiecade Brandon

28:18.520 --> 28:19.520
gives Steph an award.

28:19.520 --> 28:23.520
We already know how much of a shitshow Indiecade is, add Brandon Boye to it and you might as

28:23.520 --> 28:25.760
well burn the whole thing down, it's over.

28:25.760 --> 28:30.000
Before I move on from Brandon I want to point out something that some people have noticed,

28:30.000 --> 28:34.200
namely his funding campaign to fight his cancer, and how many people in the industry donated

28:34.200 --> 28:35.200
to it.

28:35.200 --> 28:39.760
We decided not to investigate this as a potential source of corruption for two reasons.

28:39.760 --> 28:43.960
One, because if it were so, Brandon would have to use the money he received on something

28:43.960 --> 28:48.000
other than cancer, and that is pretty much unprovable without either Brandon or a hospital

28:48.000 --> 28:50.800
staff for leaking confidential records.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.640
And two, because we're not heartless monsters.

28:53.640 --> 28:58.460
Our investigations into Brandon Boye are regarding his professional conduct and seeing how some

28:58.460 --> 29:01.320
personal relationships may negatively influence it.

29:01.320 --> 29:04.560
We have nothing personally against him, and regardless of what he may or may not have

29:04.560 --> 29:06.120
done, we hope he gets well.

29:06.120 --> 29:10.120
Of course, while it seems like Brandon Boye is a massive red flag for the IGF and wider

29:10.120 --> 29:14.200
industry all in his own, the IGF's issues don't stop with him.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.920
Remember IndieFund?

29:15.920 --> 29:19.320
We discussed their involvement in our bigger fish to fry video, but I'll give you a quick

29:19.320 --> 29:20.920
rundown right now.

29:20.920 --> 29:24.800
IndieFund is a group of people who band together to invest in indie game ideas that they think

29:24.800 --> 29:26.120
show merit.

29:26.120 --> 29:30.080
It sounds like a noble goal, until those same investors find themselves in positions of

29:30.080 --> 29:34.560
power at various award shows and are therefore able to ensure a bigger kickback of profits

29:34.560 --> 29:37.440
garnered from the increased sales that an award provides.

29:37.440 --> 29:38.960
But it goes beyond Fez.

29:38.960 --> 29:44.000
IndieFund Games seem to get a disproportionate number of IGF and IndieCade wins and nominations.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.520
I'm sure the program's founders would claim that that's how it should be, that IndieFund

29:47.520 --> 29:51.640
funds the best games, and that the award shows awards the best games.

29:51.640 --> 29:55.600
So at the end of the day, it's simply quality bubbling to the surface.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.400
But I don't think this is how it is.

29:57.400 --> 30:01.180
When you look over the list of IndieFund-backed games, you begin to see some familiar indie

30:01.180 --> 30:02.760
cabal names.

30:02.760 --> 30:05.480
Here's Robin Arnott's game, no surprise he got funded.

30:05.480 --> 30:07.760
Here's Framed, one of Zoe Quinn's games.

30:07.760 --> 30:12.080
Oh, and here's a game by good ol' Steph Therrien, Brandon Boye's pal from earlier.

30:12.080 --> 30:16.160
To an outsider like me, and I must assume to many smaller devs who are trying to get

30:16.160 --> 30:20.120
started in the industry, IndieFund looks like a group of friends funding the games of other

30:20.120 --> 30:24.860
friends while more friends give them awards, while the little people, the people who code

30:24.860 --> 30:29.240
out of their living room, the people outside of the clique, the people who pay for a fair

30:29.240 --> 30:32.360
shake at these contests and never get it, get the shaft.

30:32.360 --> 30:35.840
And speaking of Framed, it won in the IGF twice.

30:35.840 --> 30:37.680
Well holy shit, how'd that go down?

30:37.680 --> 30:43.000
I mean, I thought after the gigantic shitstorm a few years ago, when Fez won in 2008 and

30:43.000 --> 30:47.480
then entered into the IGF again in 2012, the rules were changed to prevent that.

30:47.480 --> 30:51.880
Well no, Brandon Boye decided to make 2012 a transitional year, so the rules would be

30:51.880 --> 30:56.640
fully changed in 2013, and Fez would be allowed to win a second time in 2012, but okay okay,

30:56.640 --> 30:59.040
after that, no games winning twice.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.600
Well shit Zoe, how'd you pull it off?

31:00.600 --> 31:06.560
Oh I see, Framed won in IGF China, and then later in the main IGF.

31:06.560 --> 31:10.760
Well that's a damn fine way to skirt the rules, and amongst IndieFund games, it's not just

31:10.760 --> 31:14.920
Framed and Fez that were nominated as finalists or won in the IGF twice.

31:14.920 --> 31:19.360
There was Antichamber, which was nominated in 2012, which also garnered a nomination

31:19.360 --> 31:21.800
in 2011 under the name Hazard.

31:21.800 --> 31:25.400
Is that all you have to do to get around the rules, just change your game's name?

31:25.400 --> 31:28.920
To shift gears a bit, everyone remember Tim Schafer making an ass of himself at this year's

31:28.920 --> 31:29.960
awards ceremony?

31:29.960 --> 31:34.040
Did you know Tim Schafer, who is the physical spitting image of what all these antis say

31:34.040 --> 31:35.780
the average gamer gator is?

31:35.780 --> 31:39.840
It did feel pretty good that he mentioned us in a roundabout way, with this jab at our

31:39.840 --> 31:41.680
video revealing the IGF's corruption.

31:41.680 --> 31:45.880
He seems to think we're an indie dev in that joke though, but no, we're outsiders to the

31:45.880 --> 31:46.880
industry.

31:46.880 --> 31:51.280
And as outsiders to the industry, it seems to us like IndieFund exists to fund the projects

31:51.280 --> 31:52.480
of Cabal members.

31:52.480 --> 31:55.560
Matthew Wagner's the guy that comes up a few times in this video series.

31:55.560 --> 31:59.740
Recall, he funded Fez, and later became one of the principal people behind IndieFund.

31:59.740 --> 32:02.580
He also heads up his own studio, Flashbang Studios.

32:02.580 --> 32:05.980
He's also a co-chair and regular judge and juror in the IGF.

32:05.980 --> 32:10.040
As far as I know, Wagner doesn't work for Double Fine, Tim Schafer's studio, but for

32:10.040 --> 32:14.660
some reason he does have access to Double Fine's Kickstarter financial data, which he

32:14.660 --> 32:17.380
proudly showed off in February of 2012.

32:17.380 --> 32:22.000
So at the very least, there's some type of undisclosed partnership or financial relationship

32:22.000 --> 32:23.860
between Wagner and Double Fine.

32:23.860 --> 32:28.580
Now, Tim Schafer's white guy accusing black guys of being white guys on the internet sock

32:28.580 --> 32:31.460
puppet routine isn't the only dumb thing he's done.

32:31.460 --> 32:35.360
Everybody and their grandma knows about Schafer taking Kickstarter funds and failing to deliver,

32:35.360 --> 32:39.980
but as it turns out, quite a few Double Fine employees are also judges across multiple

32:39.980 --> 32:40.980
years.

32:40.980 --> 32:44.980
Considering that Matthew Wagner coded the IGF's judging software as an IGF judge and

32:44.980 --> 32:49.460
juror repeatedly over the course of the festival's history, has a financial interest in seeing

32:49.460 --> 32:54.380
all IndieFund games get as many awards and nominations as possible, and has some undisclosed

32:54.380 --> 32:58.820
business and or financial link to Double Fine, is it no surprise to anybody that Double

32:58.820 --> 33:03.120
Fine employees start showing up repeatedly on the juror lists, or that Tim Schafer waddled

33:03.120 --> 33:07.100
on stage at the awards ceremony to make fun of people who dare question the actions of

33:07.100 --> 33:08.340
him and his pals?

33:08.340 --> 33:11.540
Let's keep going, what the fuck, I mean we're already this far in right?

33:11.540 --> 33:15.260
Here's an indie game called Hundreds that proudly displays its three honorable mentions

33:15.260 --> 33:20.640
in 2013's IGF, most notably Excellence in Visual Art, as well as its official selection

33:20.640 --> 33:22.100
in IndieCade 2012.

33:22.100 --> 33:29.060
Two of Hundreds devs are Adam Saltzman, AdamAtomic on Twitter, and Greg Wohlhand, A-E-I-O-W-U

33:29.060 --> 33:30.060
on Twitter.

33:30.060 --> 33:35.780
One of the IGF jurors in 2013, in the Excellence in Visual Art category, is Richard Hogg.

33:35.780 --> 33:40.940
And wouldn't you know it, both Hogg and Wohlhand work for Saltzman's company, Finji, where

33:40.940 --> 33:44.860
Saltzman mentions that one of the projects he's worked on is Fez, as well as Hogg having

33:44.860 --> 33:49.800
worked on HoHoCome, a game that was nominated in the IGF while another of its devs was friends

33:49.800 --> 33:51.040
with Brandon Boye.

33:51.040 --> 33:55.380
And just to round this all into a neat little package, remember Maddy Brice?

33:55.380 --> 33:59.480
Woman who outright said, downvoting all games with men in them as an IGF judge, and then

33:59.480 --> 34:05.020
was shocked, SHOCKED, that she received enough backlash to it that the IGF removed her from

34:05.020 --> 34:06.440
her position as judge?

34:06.440 --> 34:11.540
And I do mean removed, rather than resigned in protest, despite what the IGF's apology

34:11.540 --> 34:15.200
piece said at the end about her being welcome to return if she'd like.

34:15.200 --> 34:20.120
Well, that apology piece was written by a person our anonymous indie dev says is named

34:20.120 --> 34:21.120
Scavio.

34:21.120 --> 34:27.200
Scavio refers to Megan Scavio, the GM of GDC, and our anonymous friend has quite a bit to

34:27.200 --> 34:28.200
say about her.

34:28.200 --> 34:33.360
Scavio did write the apology piece, which twisted around so absurdly that she said the

34:33.360 --> 34:38.320
IGF's actions did nothing for Gamergate, when in reality, the IGF did the only thing

34:38.320 --> 34:41.460
Gamergate wanted, which was to enforce objectivity.

34:41.460 --> 34:46.280
The anonymous dev also says Scavio is a personal friend of Lea Alexander's, and she's been

34:46.280 --> 34:51.600
attempting to exert further reach than the GDC's show manager allows, and that Scavio

34:51.600 --> 34:54.600
was responsible for Tim Schafer's sock puppet joke.

34:54.600 --> 34:59.820
Scavio has been trying to push into the volunteer program, and she's also known to give preference

34:59.820 --> 35:04.880
to her friends for talks including those who are literally rehashing presentations from

35:04.880 --> 35:09.220
other people applying, and that her qualifications are nebulous at best.

35:09.220 --> 35:14.280
When asked to clarify, the anonymous dev said that Scavio would regularly threaten GDC's

35:14.280 --> 35:17.720
conference associates with expulsion if they didn't tow the party line.

35:17.720 --> 35:23.600
They also clarified that despite Scavio browbeating the conference associates, or CAs, the GDC

35:23.600 --> 35:25.800
is run by them behind the scenes.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.800
Well, what are conference associates?

35:27.800 --> 35:29.680
Maybe the GDC's website can help.

35:29.680 --> 35:33.960
So, your crowdfunding missed its target, you're a student with limited funds, your company

35:33.960 --> 35:36.200
can't send you, or you just want to lend a hand.

35:36.200 --> 35:40.480
Whatever the reason, you may still be able to attend this premiere event by becoming

35:40.480 --> 35:41.960
a conference associate.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.760
Are you willing to earn your attendance?

35:43.760 --> 35:47.080
Oh, so that's what conference associates are.

35:47.080 --> 35:49.120
Indie devs who are outside the clique.

35:49.120 --> 35:52.300
This page reads like the propaganda pamphlet to a pyramid scheme.

35:52.300 --> 35:56.800
The GDC relies on the labor of those outside of the indie cabal in order to function, and

35:56.800 --> 36:00.200
hears Scavio coming down hard on them, telling them that they'd better not step out of line

36:00.200 --> 36:02.280
if they want to have a future in game development.

36:02.280 --> 36:03.800
What a surprise.

36:03.800 --> 36:08.640
It sounds to me like Megan Scavio got hired on at the GDC not due to any sort of qualification,

36:08.640 --> 36:09.960
but because of who she knew.

36:09.960 --> 36:13.520
That she's been rejecting potential speakers at GDC only to turn around and give their

36:13.520 --> 36:16.880
work to her friends to make panels out of instead, and that she's been trying to push

36:16.880 --> 36:21.040
herself into managerial areas that her job title doesn't cover, presumably out of some

36:21.040 --> 36:22.820
kind of authoritarian power trip.

36:22.820 --> 36:27.680
I am under no illusion that what I'm about to suggest will solve all the IGF's problems

36:27.680 --> 36:28.680
overnight.

36:28.680 --> 36:34.560
But, before the next IGF opens its doors, Brandon Boye needs to step down from the position

36:34.560 --> 36:35.560
of chairman.

36:35.560 --> 36:39.600
The IGF rules need to be examined and changed appropriately.

36:39.600 --> 36:43.720
The judging software of the IGF needs to be audited by a third party.

36:43.720 --> 36:48.600
And given that the IGF operates out of California, the IGF needs to be compliant with state law

36:48.600 --> 36:53.920
regarding contests and regulations for entrant fairness, which states that, misrepresenting

36:53.920 --> 36:57.720
in any manner the odds of winning any prize is prohibited.

36:57.720 --> 37:01.780
And if after an extensive review of the IGF by an outside party reveals this law to have

37:01.780 --> 37:06.120
been broken, legal action must be taken against the parties involved.

37:06.120 --> 37:09.960
And if you're an indie dev listening to this, yes, I'll repeat my now tired refrain of

37:09.960 --> 37:12.380
please come forward and tell us what you've seen.

37:12.380 --> 37:17.120
But also, if you're an indie dev not in the cool kids club, the indie gaming inner circle,

37:17.120 --> 37:21.600
and you're considering entering your game into the next IGF, don't.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.280
Do you know what your hundred dollar entry fee is doing?

37:24.280 --> 37:25.600
It's keeping the Cabal up and running.

37:25.600 --> 37:28.800
You're paying for their rent, and you're not even getting the one thing you bought

37:28.800 --> 37:29.800
in return.

37:29.800 --> 37:31.360
A fair shake at the prize.

37:31.360 --> 37:34.360
And if you're hoping to get funding from Indie Fund, again, don't.

37:34.360 --> 37:37.080
It seems like they won't take your game no matter how good it is because you're

37:37.080 --> 37:38.240
not in the clique.

37:38.240 --> 37:40.540
I don't know how else to say this, guys.

37:40.540 --> 37:43.720
These people aren't looking out for your interests, they don't give a shit about

37:43.720 --> 37:44.720
your games.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.800
To them, you're nothing but a source of revenue.

37:46.800 --> 37:50.960
Your entry fees keep them going, and they're banking on your hope and optimism pushing

37:50.960 --> 37:53.200
you to come back against your better judgement.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.700
Don't let them do it to you.

37:54.700 --> 37:59.860
To end this off, Robert Yang was a first time IGF judge in 2014, and he wrote a blog post

37:59.860 --> 38:01.200
about his experiences.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.680
He talks about the IGF's strengths and weaknesses.

38:03.680 --> 38:06.920
He encourages people to speak out against the IGF if they think they're doing a bad

38:06.920 --> 38:07.920
job.

38:07.920 --> 38:10.720
But most importantly, he talks about the IGF's alternatives.

38:10.720 --> 38:11.720
He says,

38:11.720 --> 38:15.560
The IGF used to be one of the most important things ever, the Academy Awards or Sundance

38:15.560 --> 38:16.560
of games.

38:16.560 --> 38:20.260
But it was always a strange idea that indie developers would fight to decentralize power

38:20.260 --> 38:22.720
and then put all this prestige into this central institution.

38:22.720 --> 38:24.420
Well, I'm pretty sure I know why.

38:24.420 --> 38:27.920
Phil Fish said so himself back in the Rock Paper Shotgun article on the topic.

38:27.920 --> 38:31.820
Back when the first waves of indies were new, they saw the injustices of the industry,

38:31.820 --> 38:33.400
and they wanted a level playing field.

38:33.400 --> 38:36.280
And once they got their level playing field, they promptly built a new industry right on

38:36.280 --> 38:37.280
top of it.

38:37.280 --> 38:41.060
A new bureaucratic structure to benefit them, while the generation of indies after them

38:41.060 --> 38:44.860
is now stuck with looking at two giant corrupt systems instead of only one.

38:44.860 --> 38:49.120
We saw it happen with Occupy, we saw it happen with Project Chanology, hell, we even saw

38:49.120 --> 38:53.160
it happen with the fucking 18th century French intellectual movement.

38:53.160 --> 38:57.040
Social misfits acting in the name of equality will unite under their shared experience of

38:57.040 --> 39:00.560
misfithood, and then emulate the power structures of those that declared them misfits in the

39:00.560 --> 39:04.400
first place, solely to wield authority over the next generation of misfits that comes

39:04.400 --> 39:05.400
along.

39:05.400 --> 39:09.400
Yang goes on to say that one of the IGF's benefits, a steam deal, is becoming less exclusive

39:09.400 --> 39:13.360
over time, and that the attention the IGF garners is beginning to be usurped by the

39:13.360 --> 39:16.000
sheer audience and reach of the popular YouTubers.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
And I have to agree with him.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.560
If you're a small indie dev, and you're looking over the content of this video, and

39:20.560 --> 39:24.640
you're just completely dismayed at the giant brick wall you see in front of you, don't

39:24.640 --> 39:25.640
lose hope.

39:25.640 --> 39:28.920
Don't pay a hundred bucks to enter your game into a rigged award show you'll never

39:28.920 --> 39:29.920
win.

39:29.920 --> 39:34.160
Send a review copy of your game off to Total Biscuit, or Angry Joe, or whoever else instead.

39:34.160 --> 39:37.880
Don't support the old corrupt structures when your own customers are providing you

39:37.880 --> 39:39.200
with viable alternatives.

39:39.200 --> 39:43.100
Alistair Pintsov even said in his interview that journalists first rejected YouTubers

39:43.100 --> 39:46.680
who reached out to them, then began to attack them as their popularity grew, and now are

39:46.680 --> 39:50.040
desperately trying to emulate them as their old media methods crumble.

39:50.040 --> 39:51.040
You don't need them.

39:51.040 --> 39:56.040
A vocal anti-gamergate individual, Jen Frank of all people, wrote a reply on Unwinnable

39:56.040 --> 40:00.800
to the allegations of IGF corruption, basically saying, I was an awesome IGF judge, and everything

40:00.800 --> 40:04.040
was awesome, and the only reason I didn't play a game was because it was broken and

40:04.040 --> 40:05.040
wouldn't install.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.040
Hello.

40:06.040 --> 40:07.040
Goodbye.

40:07.040 --> 40:10.380
Camera Lady, along with a different anonymous indie dev than the one we've consistently

40:10.380 --> 40:14.680
mentioned in this video, looked into the game Jen Klein was broken, and wouldn't install.

40:14.680 --> 40:18.600
It became clear to both of them that she didn't actually play the game because the game was

40:18.600 --> 40:20.160
on iOS.

40:20.160 --> 40:23.840
A plug and play platform that requires no install process.

40:23.840 --> 40:29.840
Anonymous Dev 2 also says, right after this incident, the IGF dropped TestFlight, an application

40:29.840 --> 40:32.680
that monitored how long the judges actually played the games.

40:32.680 --> 40:36.360
I guess they didn't want to see how little the IGF judges actually gave a shit.

40:36.360 --> 40:39.400
But this wasn't why I brought up Jen Frank or her laughable article.

40:39.400 --> 40:41.240
I bring it up because of what she says here.

40:41.240 --> 40:45.640
If you think IGF judging doesn't work, find me a better system and I will lay off.

40:45.640 --> 40:46.640
I'll just go.

40:46.640 --> 40:49.160
In fact, I'll never write about video games again.

40:49.160 --> 40:53.440
And a bit later, if you honestly feel that your flame is trapped in a vacuum, move on.

40:53.440 --> 40:54.440
Just go.

40:54.440 --> 40:56.080
There are other communities that will accept you.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.360
Create your own system.

40:57.360 --> 40:58.440
Make your own clubhouse.

40:58.440 --> 40:59.520
I dare you.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.840
The absolute arrogance here is astounding.

41:01.840 --> 41:03.480
She sounds like an abusive lover.

41:03.480 --> 41:05.640
Hey indies, I dare you to leave us.

41:05.640 --> 41:06.700
I dare you.

41:06.700 --> 41:07.700
You need us.

41:07.700 --> 41:08.700
You'll never go.

41:08.700 --> 41:11.280
Well, indie devs, it's time for you to call that bluff.

41:11.280 --> 41:12.720
The IGF doesn't care about you.

41:12.720 --> 41:17.240
It cares about Brandon Boyer's friends, and Tim Schafer's friends, and Matthew Wagner's

41:17.240 --> 41:19.280
friends, and Phil Fish's friends.

41:19.280 --> 41:20.800
It doesn't care about indies.

41:20.800 --> 41:24.820
It cares about people who were indies 10 years ago and have now become part of the establishment

41:24.820 --> 41:26.960
while not wanting to take off the indie hat.

41:26.960 --> 41:28.400
You are nothing to them.

41:28.400 --> 41:31.200
They're daring you to leave, thinking they'll never do it.

41:31.200 --> 41:32.480
Those losers need us.

41:32.480 --> 41:33.480
We have the power.

41:33.480 --> 41:35.040
But there is a new clubhouse.

41:35.040 --> 41:37.240
We're offering it to you, right here and now.

41:37.240 --> 41:40.140
Turn away from these sycophants and never look back.

41:40.140 --> 41:45.360
And hey, Jen Frank, when the indie devs get fed up with your inflammatory bullshit and

41:45.360 --> 41:49.140
leave you and your clique of corrupt friends high and dry, I expect you to hold up your

41:49.140 --> 41:51.960
end of the bargain and never write about video games again.

41:51.960 --> 41:57.520
We'll all be better off for it.

41:57.520 --> 41:58.520
That's all for today, guys.

41:58.520 --> 42:01.120
It wasn't just camera lady sleuthing in my reading that brought this video together.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.120
A lot of us worked on it.

42:02.120 --> 42:05.900
Special thanks to Derek Smart for willing to discuss issues rather than simply mudslinging.

42:05.900 --> 42:09.420
As well as to our two anonymous indie devs, who asked to remain anonymous because they

42:09.420 --> 42:13.400
legitimately fear for their jobs and careers by speaking out against the IGF and all these

42:13.400 --> 42:14.400
individuals.

42:14.440 --> 42:18.080
Special thanks to William Usher, who helped providing us with some contacts, and Thryden,

42:18.080 --> 42:23.340
Stealth Suit, Krios, and somebody only by the name of Temporary Account 2 for providing

42:23.340 --> 42:24.880
some of the information and leads.

42:24.880 --> 42:28.120
And a very special thanks to three people who actually gave us money to keep this show

42:28.120 --> 42:29.120
going.

42:29.120 --> 42:32.220
Pasquale Festa, Hente Logic, and the late and great King of Pole.

42:32.220 --> 42:34.920
At this point, I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about something else.

42:34.920 --> 42:38.480
It's only slightly related to Gamergate, so if you want to check out now, that's completely

42:38.480 --> 42:39.480
fine.

42:39.480 --> 42:40.480
Feel free to do so.

42:40.480 --> 42:42.420
There's no hard feelings from myself or camera at all.

42:42.440 --> 42:45.120
I'm sure this video's gone on long enough as it is.

42:45.120 --> 42:48.400
Camera Lady recently had a conversation over on the Let's Play subreddit.

42:48.400 --> 42:52.380
As I'm sure you know, we also post Let's Plays, anime reviews, and other stuff on this channel,

42:52.380 --> 42:54.820
along with these indefensible videos.

42:54.820 --> 42:58.620
Somebody with 20,000 subscribers and 3 million views started a thread about how to grow your

42:58.620 --> 43:02.380
channel, so camera asked some questions about it looking how to grow our short pet otaku

43:02.380 --> 43:07.860
channel here, and was promptly tore into for supporting Gamergate, accusing us of simply

43:07.860 --> 43:12.460
using Gamergate and not contributing to it, shilling on the hashtag, being misogynist,

43:12.460 --> 43:13.460
and so on.

43:13.460 --> 43:17.980
We always wanted to do a video, or at least talk at the end of a Gamergate video, introducing

43:17.980 --> 43:21.260
us and our other content to our new Gamergate subscribers.

43:21.260 --> 43:24.940
But this conversation made us think long and hard about what we should be saying.

43:24.940 --> 43:28.340
We don't want to appear as shills, we don't want to appear like we're just using Gamergate

43:28.340 --> 43:29.780
for attention.

43:29.780 --> 43:33.940
If we were, I don't think we'd be doing this much investigative work in these videos that

43:33.940 --> 43:34.940
we make.

43:34.940 --> 43:39.740
But at the same time, we do want to promote ourselves, to promote our other types of videos,

43:39.740 --> 43:42.140
and generally just to grow as a channel.

43:42.140 --> 43:45.140
It's no secret that we take money and gifts from people willing to give them to us.

43:45.140 --> 43:48.740
I want to take a minute here and outline exactly what we do with what we get, and why it's

43:48.740 --> 43:51.980
relevant to our Gamergate video series, not just our other stuff.

43:51.980 --> 43:54.260
To start off, yes we have a Patreon.

43:54.260 --> 43:57.820
It's at, predictably, patreon.com slash short pet otaku.

43:57.820 --> 44:01.580
For anybody interested in giving not on a monthly basis, but only once, we also have

44:01.580 --> 44:05.540
a paypal account under the email shortpetotaku at hotmail.com.

44:05.540 --> 44:09.380
And we have publicly posted our address for physical gifts, but I don't think I'm going

44:09.380 --> 44:11.180
to provide that in a Gamergate video.

44:11.180 --> 44:14.380
Now in the interest of transparency, I'm going to provide you with a list of rules we've

44:14.380 --> 44:17.740
set for ourselves regarding the money that we get from you, mainly because we're from

44:17.740 --> 44:21.900
the old guard of the internet that always saw money making on the internet as sketchy,

44:21.900 --> 44:24.820
and social media not being anonymous as a massive mistake.

44:24.820 --> 44:29.280
Rule one, we don't want anybody to feel pressured to give us anything, ever.

44:29.280 --> 44:32.080
If you want to give us anything, or can't afford to give us anything, it will never

44:32.080 --> 44:33.880
ever be held against you.

44:33.880 --> 44:36.640
If you want to run ad blockers in our videos, same deal.

44:36.640 --> 44:40.520
I don't ever want anybody to feel excluded from our channel, our content, or any kind

44:40.520 --> 44:44.100
of community going around us because they can't or won't give money.

44:44.100 --> 44:45.100
Everybody is welcome here.

44:45.100 --> 44:49.520
Rule two, we have patreon set to monthly because we're actually a daily upload channel, and

44:49.520 --> 44:51.620
setting it to per video is a bit ridiculous.

44:51.620 --> 44:56.600
This isn't like so many journalists or developers or mid-tier e-celebs out there who simply

44:56.600 --> 44:59.980
set it to monthly, do next to nothing, and rake in the dough.

44:59.980 --> 45:01.800
We are always posting something.

45:01.800 --> 45:08.040
Rule three, 100% of any money you give us, on patreon, or paypal, or through ad revenue,

45:08.040 --> 45:09.520
will be used on our channel.

45:09.520 --> 45:10.520
Period.

45:10.520 --> 45:11.520
No exceptions.

45:11.520 --> 45:12.760
We don't intend to live off of your generosity.

45:12.760 --> 45:17.320
We have a wish list of sound equipment, lighting equipment, camera equipment, and games and

45:17.320 --> 45:18.600
anime we like to do videos on.

45:18.600 --> 45:22.800
You will not see us rake in 13k a month and then brag about getting a new motorcycle on

45:22.800 --> 45:23.800
twitter.

45:23.800 --> 45:24.800
Like some people.

45:24.800 --> 45:29.680
As a sub rule, whenever we're given a physical gift, like a game or anime, we'll guarantee

45:29.680 --> 45:30.680
you'll get videos on it.

45:30.680 --> 45:34.640
The Bible Black DVD set was given to us as a gift from a fan, and we made six riff videos

45:34.640 --> 45:35.680
out of it so far.

45:35.680 --> 45:40.340
If you are generous enough to give to us, we feel it is our responsibility to give back

45:40.340 --> 45:41.820
to you in kind.

45:41.820 --> 45:46.640
Rule four, we will post the receipts of any purchase made with your money on the short

45:46.640 --> 45:47.960
Fedotaku twitter account.

45:47.960 --> 45:53.040
As an example, we spent $90 on an SNES flashcard using YouTube ad revenue, and Dave put up

45:53.040 --> 45:54.880
a picture of the receipt on twitter.

45:54.880 --> 45:59.000
We intend to use the cart to revive a series called Game Roulette, the first two seasons

45:59.000 --> 46:00.660
of which can be found on our channel.

46:00.660 --> 46:05.400
Over the years we have also purchased an AT2020 microphone, an Elgato, a Dazzle, and several

46:05.400 --> 46:08.440
older consoles using BlipTV ad revenue.

46:08.440 --> 46:12.440
You will always know what we're doing with your money and which purchases contribute

46:12.440 --> 46:13.840
to which of our projects.

46:13.840 --> 46:20.400
Rule five, yes, this stuff will also help Indefensible as a series grow, not just our

46:20.400 --> 46:21.840
let's plays and reviews.

46:21.840 --> 46:26.720
Hamerlady estimates $300 to update our audio equipment, which we intend to use to improve

46:26.720 --> 46:30.160
our gamergate video's audio quality as well as our other projects.

46:30.160 --> 46:34.600
The editing PC and potentially even the new camera will also expand what we can do for

46:34.600 --> 46:35.600
Indefensible.

46:35.600 --> 46:39.060
It's true that your money will be going towards our other projects, but it will simultaneously

46:39.060 --> 46:41.440
also be going towards new gamergate videos.

46:41.440 --> 46:45.080
If you're interested in giving, but you're on the fence because you only watch us for

46:45.080 --> 46:49.160
gamergate, don't worry, your money will go towards gamergate.

46:49.160 --> 46:53.280
Rule six, this bears saying a second time, nobody has to give.

46:53.280 --> 46:58.040
The truth of it is, if we got exactly zero dollars from anybody, we would still upload

46:58.040 --> 46:59.040
daily.

46:59.040 --> 47:00.200
The let's plays would still come.

47:00.200 --> 47:01.880
The anime reviews would still be coming.

47:01.880 --> 47:05.520
We'd still try to put out Indefensible once a week, though I don't know how successful

47:05.520 --> 47:06.520
we'd be.

47:06.520 --> 47:09.740
If you're somebody who just does not give a shit about our channel outside of gamergate

47:09.740 --> 47:13.720
and does not care to give us anything to improve our gamergate videos, that's still fine with

47:13.720 --> 47:14.720
us.

47:14.720 --> 47:15.720
You'll always be welcome here.

47:15.720 --> 47:19.200
We never want to become that asshole who shits on his viewerbase for not doing enough

47:19.200 --> 47:20.200
or whatever.

47:20.200 --> 47:23.320
We leave the option to give it to us open to you if you like our content and feel inclined

47:23.320 --> 47:26.440
to do so, and we will never look down on somebody who doesn't.

47:26.440 --> 47:30.120
The way I see it is the internet has a lot of huge gaping money pits.

47:30.120 --> 47:32.180
Some of them are good causes, a lot of them aren't.

47:32.180 --> 47:35.320
If you decide to throw some into ours, I can promise you that we'll be grateful and that

47:35.320 --> 47:38.120
we'll put your money to good use investing in our channel, and if that doesn't appeal

47:38.120 --> 47:39.240
to you, that's okay too.

47:39.240 --> 47:41.280
Please stay and enjoy whatever videos you want.

47:41.280 --> 47:42.280
Well, that's my pitch.

47:42.280 --> 47:44.120
I don't know how strong it is, but there it is.

47:44.120 --> 47:48.040
If you're interested, the paypal email is shortpilotaka.com and the Patreon is under

47:48.040 --> 47:49.040
shortpilotaka.

47:49.040 --> 47:51.320
And if you're not, thanks for listening this far anyway.

47:51.320 --> 47:55.040
We hope to get up another indefensible video in about a week and a half's time, camera

47:55.040 --> 47:58.560
lady sleuthing dug up several more topics of interest that weren't related to the IGF,

47:58.560 --> 48:01.000
so it's going to be a whole lot of fun in the coming weeks.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.920
And if you want to see me and Dave sooner, come check out our other stuff.

48:04.920 --> 48:05.640
We upload daily.
