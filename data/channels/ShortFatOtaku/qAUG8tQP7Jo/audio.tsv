0	4640	This video is not meant to be a statement of absolute fact, nor does it exist to directly
4640	6120	accuse anybody of anything.
6120	9600	Rather, it's a presentation of the evidence that we've discovered and an open call for
9600	13840	others on both the inside and out to discuss the issues explored therein.
13840	18760	Furthermore, any audio accompanied by the Devon no-talent gaming artwork can be considered
18760	21760	to be entirely our own opinion or conjecture on a topic.
21760	22600	Thank you and enjoy!
30000	38320	Hey guys, Dev here.
38320	42540	I hope you all enjoyed the April Fools video, I'm sorry this one's a bit later than usual,
42540	46280	we actually had it finished by Saturday, but camera lady's computer shit out on her for
46280	47280	a few days.
47280	51680	I hope you've all seen our video on the IGDA, because this serves as an unofficial sequel
51680	52680	to it.
52680	55580	After our video dropped, we received the usual backlash.
55580	59880	People inside who are clearly anti-Gamergate, simply calling us misogynists and whatever
59880	62320	for daring to question the current power structure.
62320	66880	But camera lady got to talking with one notable individual on the inside who wasn't actually
66880	70600	interested in baselessly slinging mud, and his name was Derek Smart.
70600	72720	Now Derek's no stranger to gamergate.
72720	77040	Earlier this month some info surfaced regarding the IGDA's head, Kate Edwards.
77040	80780	She's trans, and was known as Tom Edwards before her transition.
80780	85840	I want to make this absolutely clear, this is not about Kate being trans.
85840	90920	I bring this up solely to show that she performed actions when she was known as Tom, that have
90920	93260	bearings on her current business as Kate.
93260	97660	Any comment or criticism directed towards Kate has nothing to do with her status as
97660	98740	a trans woman.
98740	103740	As Tom Edwards, she founded her own consulting firm, Englobe, which later had its name changed
103740	104860	to Geografie.
104860	108700	As Kate Edwards, she became the executive director of the IGDA.
108700	114580	Geografie, the consulting firm Kate Edwards owns, is contracted to do consulting for the
114580	117980	IGDA, the organization Kate Edwards currently heads up.
117980	122260	This seems like a very obvious conflict of interest, with the well-known gamergate lawyer
122260	124820	Mike Cernovich saying it sounds illegal.
124820	125940	And here's where Derek Smart comes in.
125940	130300	Derek wrote a reply to both our video and this new information regarding Kate Edwards
130300	131300	owning Geografie.
131300	133340	Let me go over a few important bits.
133340	137820	Derek says he listens to both sides of gamergate and tries to have reasonable discourse.
137820	140940	Based on his conversation with Camera Lady, I'd say that's the truth.
140940	146260	He's equally welcoming and critical to both gamergate supporters and anti-GGers and seems
146260	148180	to be willing to talk to just about anybody.
148180	153620	Derek says, in more words, that his experiences with the IGDA have shown him that they're
153620	154620	on the level.
154620	159300	Derek discusses the Geografie claims, stating that given the seriousness and nature of the
159300	163780	allegations and knowing that nobody was going to respond, I took it upon myself to get to
163780	164820	the bottom of it.
164820	169900	If Kate Edwards was one woman holding two positions, who got hired to those two positions
169900	174900	independently of her involvement in the other, and then afterwards suddenly the IGDA is doing
174900	178740	business with Geografie, that would be illegal.
178740	184820	But Derek says that Kate is not actually employed by the IGDA, but rather she is employed by
184820	189260	Geografie and is contracted out to the IGDA as its chairman.
189260	193300	I've personally seen this happen a lot in multiple industries, where a worker will be
193300	198300	employed by a firm that exists specifically to rent workers out to other companies.
198300	202820	A simple way to describe this is like so, Kate doesn't hold positions of power in
202820	207980	both Geografie and the IGDA, and she doesn't use that to funnel money from one to the other.
207980	212920	Kate holds a position of power in Geografie, and the IGDA pays Geografie for Kate to also
212920	216100	hold a position of power and manage the IGDA.
216100	220220	Her management is literally what the IGDA is paying Geografie for.
220380	223740	Now Derek doesn't offer any proof of his claims, but I honestly don't think he's
223740	224740	able to.
224740	228580	He's not going to have access to Kate Edwards contract, and even if he did I doubt he'd
228580	229940	legally be able to publish it.
229940	233620	Is it possible that Derek's lying, or was misinformed by the people he spoke to to get
233620	234620	his information?
234620	235620	Sure.
235620	239100	But the fact that he is one of the only people with any connections that has been consistently
239100	243780	open minded and reasonable makes me want to trust him, and I'm also not willing to completely
243780	248340	backstab and alienate a guy because I have a predetermined outcome regarding the IGDA
248340	249620	and his reply doesn't fit it.
249620	253580	We can't ask for insiders to come forward and then accuse them of lying or covering
253580	256880	things up when they give us answers we don't want to hear.
256880	258060	Not without proof.
258060	262340	If Derek's either lying or misinformed, then Kate Edwards is actually doing some pretty
262340	263340	corrupt shit.
263340	267780	Kate would be in a position to move money from the non-profit IGDA to her own personal
267780	268780	company.
268780	272180	And even if Kate's entirely on the level, the fact that her company was given the contract
272180	276020	over others that may be just as capable is corruption in itself.
276020	280540	However, if Derek's correct, and I think he is, then what he has to say lines up with
280540	286060	the anonymous indie dev from the last video that claimed Kate and the IGDA isn't corrupt,
286060	287060	but just a bit flip-floppy.
287060	291380	However, even with Derek telling the truth, I do think there's a bit of a problem with
291380	293140	Geogrify, even if it's only a minor one.
293140	297700	Geogrify does consulting for not only the IGDA, but also several games studios.
297700	301220	I'm not sure if it's appropriate for the same company to have its hands in the management
301220	305420	of both the studios and the organization that exists to stand up for the rights of those
305420	309560	studios' employees, but this seems to be minor and is nothing like any sort of money
309560	311600	funneling that we all initially thought.
311600	316740	As for the IGDA's connection to UBM's other properties like the IGF and GDC, Derek and
316740	320620	Camera actually agree that the connections looked bad, but having the potential for something
320620	324960	to go wrong is not the same as something actually going wrong, and Derek wants to default to
324960	328260	trust the people running things until they prove they can't be trusted.
328260	332920	At the same time, Derek admitted to knowing nothing about the IGF side of the equation,
332920	334220	as he doesn't deal with them.
334220	339420	Even if the IGDA is completely innocent, IGF has more than enough corrupt bullshit happening
339420	342580	inside to cover the entire UBM family anyway.
342580	345980	A little while back, Alistair Pinsauf gave an interview on TechRaptor regarding what
345980	347560	he knows about the IGF.
347560	351540	He says that a lot of what we had initially dug up was somewhat inaccurate, but there
351540	355500	was enough truth there that he had to take a hard look back at his own experiences and
355500	358540	felt a moral imperative to come forward and share what he had witnessed.
358540	361740	I think his assessment of our video is fair.
361740	363260	We're not industry insiders.
363260	367420	Our lady is just a near-mute autist who is good at digging up info, and I can only read
367420	368420	what she gives me.
368420	372060	We can only go off of what we managed to sleuth up from the underbelly of the internet.
372060	374300	However, the video achieved its goal.
374300	378180	It got the gears turning inside the brains of many people inside the industry.
378180	383660	Indies, journalists, and judges have all come out both publicly and privately to say, something
383660	387300	fucked up happened with me during the IGF and I didn't think much of it until I saw
387300	389580	your video, and that's what we hoped would happen.
389580	392540	The truth of it is, we can't do much.
392540	395780	We can boycott sites and encourage others to do the same.
395780	399980	We can refuse to pay for games or refuse to play them, but reforming the IGF is only going
399980	404160	to happen if the indie devs who enter the IGF come together and demand it.
404160	406820	And we want IGF reform just as much as you do.
406820	411260	Not just so that undeserving games stop getting awards and therefore stop getting press coverage,
411260	415260	but also for every single indie developer who pays to enter the IGF not knowing that
415260	418500	they have no chance at winning regardless of the quality of their game, just because
418500	420180	they're not friends with the right people.
420180	425420	For the indie devs who want to speak out, who have seen injustices but fear retaliation.
425420	428780	For people like the anonymous indie dev we mentioned in the last video that spoke to
428780	432620	Camera Lady, who provided us with a major lead regarding the IGF.
432620	437540	They said to look into winners who were judges before they were winners.
437540	440560	Camera Lady mentioned the only reason that she and her friends had been able to show
440560	445100	judges being connected to winners was due to the Polytron leaked financial documents,
445100	447580	and without that knowledge it would be harder to do.
447580	452300	But the indie devs said not to look at years where a judge won a game in the same year,
452300	455180	but to find winners who were judges in all other years.
455180	461020	In essence, there's a group of indie devs that double as judges in the IGF every single
461020	464260	year except the years in which they enter a game.
464260	467780	And when a member of that group steps out of the judge pool in a given year to enter
467780	471680	a game, the other members of the group push that game through.
471680	475580	And the next year, the judge who received a boost last time around returns to the judge
475580	478340	pool to help push another member through.
478340	482840	Now I'd like to define some terms from the IGF itself using a statement they wrote in
482840	484620	reply to our original video.
484620	488540	In it, the difference between judge and juror is spelled out.
488540	493900	The judges are anonymous, and as of the latest IGF, number at approximately 375.
493900	497580	They're given a random selection of games to judge, but are also able to vote on any
497580	499380	other game in the pool that they'd like.
499380	503940	And although they don't say this in the statement, it's been confirmed by several other sources,
503940	508620	some we even used in the previous video, that it only takes a total of 8 years for
508620	510580	a game to move to the next round.
510580	513020	Meanwhile, the jurors are not anonymous.
513020	518320	Their announcement happens annually with some fanfare, almost as if they're considered celebrities.
518320	522420	And each juror is assigned to a specific award with the task of deciding the finalists and
522420	526340	ultimately the winner of that award from the pool of games that the judges all recommend
526340	527500	from the previous round.
527500	531760	In another statement, this time announcing the resignation of Maddy Brice, the IGF confirms
531760	536360	that a single individual can be both a judge and juror in the same year, by describing
536360	539720	her as performing both of these duties before leaving the IGF.
539720	544200	There's an obvious problem right away, if a game is already well known, it doesn't take
544200	548880	much for 8 judges to peruse the list, find the famous game, and give it an upvote.
548880	552360	Moreover, it's also no problem for 8 judges to come together and push a game through the
552360	553980	system regardless of its quality.
553980	557680	This is one of the reasons why Maddy Brice's infamous tweet describing her personal voting
557680	562840	metric as downvoting all games with men in them was considered to be extremely corrupt.
562840	567960	In any case, this gave us an obvious way forward, find the IGF judge and juror lists, see who
567960	572100	consistently judges every year except the years in which they enter a game, and see
572100	575480	if they consistently win awards every time they step out to enter.
575480	578520	It's not conclusive proof, but it's certainly a start.
578520	583280	Despite the IGF judges being considered anonymous nowadays, it wasn't always so.
583280	588040	The IGF used to publish their judge lists alongside their jury lists, specifically at
588040	593320	the URL www.igf.com slash judges.html.
593320	597340	This is relevant because each year, the judge list for that year would be published at the
597340	601920	exact same HTML file, overwriting the previous year's judge list.
601920	605920	Using the magical powers of the internet wayback machine, it actually becomes relatively easy
605920	610040	to catalog each year's judge list, all right from the same address.
610040	618120	The judge lists archived from www.igf.com slash judges.html are from 2006 to 2009.
618120	621280	But from 2010 onward, there's nothing but dead pages.
621280	625720	Camberlady began cataloging all of the judges into a spreadsheet to see when recurring judges
625720	629480	stepped away for a year, with the intention to cross-reference their stepping back with
629480	632000	the awards winners and finalists for that year.
632000	636280	But those missing judge lists from 2010 onward put a damper on the whole endeavor, don't
636280	637280	they?
637280	642680	Well here's some info at www.igf.com slash 2011juries.html.
642680	644160	But this seems a bit different, doesn't it?
644160	646760	People are grouped by awards and given extensive bios.
646760	651480	Ah, right, that would be because this is the juror list, not the judge list.
651480	656440	Remember, after 2011, the judge list had become private, and the jury list is released every
656440	658000	year with fanfare.
658000	661680	But from the IGF statement on Mati Bryce, we do know that many anonymous judges are
661680	663440	also public jurors.
663440	665320	There's still something odd about this though.
665360	668840	If you go to the public judge list back on the Internet Wayback Machine, you'll see
668840	672200	that they're collectively called the competition jury rather than judges.
672200	675560	Man, it's almost like the IGF just keeps shuffling their terminology around in order
675560	676560	to confuse people.
676560	678080	Well, maybe this'll help.
678080	681320	In depth, demystifying the IGF judging process.
681320	687080	This was posted on IGF.com in January 2010 and was written by Jens Bergensten, otherwise
687080	689240	known as Jeb of Minecraft fam.
689240	694240	Now Jeb talks about being a judge in the current IGF, which was 2010 at the time, as well as
694240	698800	previous years, and that he's never gotten the luxury of a nomination at this point.
698800	704760	Well, the very next year, 2011, Jeb's game, Cobalt, gets nominated for Excellence in Audio
704760	705760	at the IGF.
705760	709880	And in 2012, Jeb tweets that he's been assigned to judge at the IGF again.
709880	715240	And again in 2013, Jeb tweets about his experience judging for the IGF, and how he finds the
715240	718960	good entries, sort by number of judge comments.
718960	723600	This does lend credence to Camera Lady's initial theory that well-known games, or developers,
723600	728760	aka those within the clique, entering the IGF have an inherent advantage over any kind
728760	733280	of new, truly indie dev, and that all it would take to force a game to the top of the pile
733280	736040	is a small number of judges coming together to give it a push.
736040	739460	I didn't even bring up Jeb with the intention of actually looking into him, but he fits
739460	743280	the bill of the rotating cabal of judges theory the anonymous dev put forward.
743280	751240	Jeb is a judge in the IGF in 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013, only skipping out on 2011 because
751240	752800	he had entered Cobalt.
752800	757760	And would you look at that, Cobalt got to advertise that it was an IGF finalist.
757760	760600	Jesus Christ, let me actually get to where I was going.
760600	766620	In Jeb's writing, he describes the differences between IGF 2009 and IGF 2010.
766620	771360	Starting in 2010, there was a nouveau category that judges could nominate games to via a
771360	776380	yes or no, which does potentially contradict what was written in the Maggie Bryce piece
776380	779300	regarding there being no downvoting in the judging process.
779300	782780	There were 150 judges in 2010, and they were anonymous.
782780	785720	You could only see the name of another judge if they commented on a game.
785720	790160	But Jeb says something of note, I was only allowed to score the games in my list, but
790160	794000	I could try the other games if I liked so I could gain perspective on the quality of
794000	795000	those titles.
795000	797920	It was also possible for me to write comments on the games.
797920	802260	This goes completely against what multiple sources have said that any judge can vote
802260	803260	on any game.
803260	808220	Jeb also talks about the finalist judging back in 2010, saying, following all of the
808220	813080	first round judging, the IGF judges have about a month to play all the finalists and
813080	815060	simply vote for their winner in each category.
815060	819760	No mention of a public division between anonymous judges and publicized jurors.
819760	823680	These are two interesting inconsistencies, which I want to address a bit later in the
823680	824680	video.
824680	826900	Alex May offers a second opinion in Jeb's piece.
826900	831260	He outright admits to being a judge in 2010 and a finalist in 2009, thanks for saving
831260	836020	camera some time there bro, and just like with Jeb, easily found tweets and articles
836020	840040	confirming he was also a judge and juror in 2011, 2012, and 2013.
840040	843980	Alex May admits to having approximately two days per game assigned to him, but decided
843980	847300	to leave it all until the last minute, and that based on the activity of the private
847300	850440	judging website, most other judges did the same.
850440	854180	This lines up with the Rotten Cartridges blog post, where an entrant describes how most
854180	858020	judges assigned to their game didn't actually play it, and how only one judge played it
858020	861820	for more than five minutes, and how he only received a response from the IGF after he
861820	863760	threatened to go public with the information.
863760	867560	The third opinion is written by Michael Rose, and to give him credit, he seems to do the
867560	868880	right thing.
868880	872680	He decided that the only way he was going to judge this list of games fairly was if
872680	876680	he played them from top to bottom, not picking out the ones I had already come across or
876680	878480	was previously excited to play.
878480	882840	The piece ends off with a word from Simon Carlos, the IGF chairman back in January of
882840	884220	2010.
884220	888720	He says, since the independent games festival is becoming so important to many small game
888720	893560	developers' lives, we're committed to transparency because we know that indie game creators
893560	897640	want to understand what is happening to their game in the process of IGF judging.
897640	900280	Of course, the IGF is no stranger to criticism.
900280	904200	It's not just Cameron Lady's digs, or the Rotten Cartridges blog post, or Team Meat's
904200	907440	podcast where they describe their judging experience being a complete shit show, or
907440	911120	Alistair Pynsoff, or any of the others who were inspired to step forward and talk after
911120	912180	a video is dropped.
912180	916360	The criticism goes back a long way, and used to actually come from the people that now
916360	919280	devoutly describe themselves as Gamergate's opposition.
919280	924760	Rock Paper Shotgun's Brandon Caldwell published The Story Behind the IGF's Critics, and in
924760	928600	it he talks to a developer and vocal IGF critic, Anna Anthropy.
928600	934240	Yes, the same Anna Anthropy whose personal friends, Patricia Hernandez and Lea Alexander,
934240	936600	wrote about without disclosing their friendships.
936600	941760	The same Anna Anthropy who is vehemently anti-Gamergate, and is in fact one of the corrupt individuals
941760	945920	GG investigated, was once vocal in her criticisms of the IGF.
945920	947560	The article talks about a pirate cart.
947560	951240	A large number of indie games all entered into the IGF as one game because they were
951240	954760	all contained within the same larger game, like in Action 52.
954760	959180	The article states that some see this as a protest against the IGF's unfit rules and
959180	960360	high entry fees.
960360	964600	Anna herself says it was definitely a reaction to Fez winning the grand prize at the IGF
964600	965600	two separate years.
965600	969240	It raised a lot of awareness both of these games that would never have been so widely
969240	972920	played if the pirate cart hadn't existed, and also just for the fact that the IGF is
972920	973920	bullshit.
973920	979640	It goes on to say, the fact that Fez can have already won an IGF award and now is nominated
979640	983360	for two other awards, including the grand prize, I think it's a really good reminder
983360	987360	that the IGF is all about cliqueyness, the scene-sters that I yell about, the fact that
987360	990440	it's about the established quote unquote indie scene.
990440	994760	Here is not only what we've been saying, but what many indie devs have been saying since
994760	999520	Gamergate began, straight from the mouth of Gamergate's opposition years ago.
999520	1002440	Phil Fish himself even decides to step up to the plate.
1002440	1007000	He says that, after asking Brandon Boye about it, and being told the game had changed enough
1007000	1008880	to allow re-entry, he did so.
1008880	1011000	Fish describes the current IGF thusly.
1011000	1013520	The IGF wants the biggest, best games to enter.
1013520	1017440	They don't want the best developers to sit it out and be like, oh, we're too good and
1017440	1018440	this is the kids' table.
1018440	1021320	They really hate that kind of conception that the IGF is a scholarship.
1021320	1022420	It kind of used to be.
1022420	1023420	It got us started.
1023420	1026880	It got the attention of publishers and it got us the Microsoft deal, but that's just
1026880	1027880	a bonus.
1027880	1030160	So, what can we take away from this?
1030160	1032240	That the IGF doesn't want to be indie anymore?
1032240	1035740	I mean, it's certainly not a place for AAA developers, but it's pretty obvious what's
1035740	1036800	being said here.
1036800	1040400	There is now a divide between developing a game out of your basement indie and owning
1040400	1044640	your own game studio indie, and it's very clear which of the two groups make up the
1044640	1051280	judges, jurors, IGF staff, IGF winners, IGF finalists, and ultimately who the IGF wants
1051280	1052280	at the top.
1052280	1055880	We have consistently said that indie is just not indie anymore.
1055880	1058240	It's become its own institution and bureaucracy.
1058240	1063980	And Phil Fish, being interviewed by a fucking rock-paper-shotgun of all outlets, is confirming
1063980	1065560	everything we've been saying.
1065560	1070280	I honestly recommend you read the entire article, because there's just way too much both Phil
1070280	1072740	Fish and Anna Anthropy say to cover here.
1072740	1077000	But they parrot everything we've been saying for the past eight months about the IGF, with
1077000	1082200	Phil even going so far as to say, yeah, all my coworkers and friends are judges, and Brandon
1082200	1085160	Boy is my friend too, but it's totally not what it seems.
1085160	1086160	It's fucking surreal.
1086160	1090880	And as a cherry on top, check out Ed McMillan from Team Meat, and his wife Danielle chatting
1090880	1118240	about the whole thing while playing Binding
1328240	1354720	And then there's David Rosen of Humble Bundle fame, who is very anti-gamergate, sparing
1354720	1359760	no opportunity to call us all misogynists, dig into Total Biscuit, shill for Arthur Chu,
1359760	1361420	the whole nine yards.
1361420	1366360	And here he is in 2009, bringing up many of these issues with the IGF, issues that have
1366360	1367840	only grown since then.
1367840	1369000	Let's do a quick recap.
1369000	1373760	Jeb reveals that, back in 2010, judges vote on games, and those same judges then again
1373760	1375760	vote on the finalists to decide a winner.
1375760	1380440	In a post titled, Letter from the Chairman, explaining IGF's changes for 2011, the new
1380440	1384200	system of anonymous judges and specialist jurors is revealed.
1384200	1388400	Jeb also notes that he can only vote on the games he was given, when we know for a fact
1388400	1391080	that judges nowadays can vote on any game they like.
1391080	1396560	From 2006 to 2009, the internet wayback machine has a record of the IGF posting full public
1396560	1397560	judge lists.
1397560	1403560	This stops with IGF 2010, and going forward only public jury lists are posted, with their
1403560	1408520	reveals being treated almost like reality TV show twists by Gamasutra, the news outlet
1408520	1411080	owned by the IGF's parent company, UBM.
1411080	1415320	People who were vehemently anti-gamergate, both developers and journalists, were once
1415320	1419160	completely willing to criticize and investigate the IGF's conduct.
1419160	1420160	But now?
1420160	1424600	Not just radio silence from almost everybody, but directed attacks towards journalists and
1424600	1426920	developers who speak out against the IGF.
1426920	1431760	It's like a giant switch was flipped at around mid 2010 inside the IGF.
1431760	1437000	New judging systems were set in place, oversight was slowly dismantled, lists of contributors
1437000	1440560	were hidden away, and the people who should have been speaking out louder than ever all
1440560	1442200	suddenly shut up.
1442200	1443440	What the fuck happened?
1443440	1446060	Well, I'll tell you what happened.
1446060	1451600	One of the last public acts of Simon Carlos, the former chairman of the IGF, was to write
1451600	1457160	the ending paragraph of Jeb's post talking about how committed the IGF was to transparency,
1457160	1459000	back in January of 2010.
1459000	1465880	In May of that same year, our good friend Brandon Boye replaced Carlos as the IGF chairman,
1465880	1468140	and he has remained in that position to this day.
1468140	1472820	In Brandon's first, message from the chairman post, he ends it by saying, in the coming
1472820	1477140	weeks and months, I'll be laying out some of the ways that will be modifying and improving
1477140	1479020	the way the festival operates.
1479020	1483780	And the very next post on the site is a description of the new system that allows any judge to
1483780	1487340	vote for any game, and keeps judge lists private.
1487340	1489540	What the fuck happened?
1489540	1491460	Brandon Boye became chair.
1491460	1496220	Now in Alistair Pynsoff's interview on TechRaptor, he too has a lot to say about Brandon.
1496220	1501540	Pynsoff says, here's a guy who runs multiple award shows, runs sites that promotes indies,
1501540	1507140	is friends with devs, PR, all media types, and here he is on the Game Journal Pro's group.
1507140	1512080	To Brandon's credit, it does make sense that he was there, as he was a journalist before
1512080	1514020	becoming IGF chair.
1514020	1518180	But he was chairman after 2010, and leaked emails from the mailing list show that he
1518180	1522460	didn't leave, nor did he remain silent within the list after becoming chairman.
1522460	1524660	Pynsoff seems to share our opinion on Brandon.
1524660	1529500	He says, I think Boye is a good guy at heart, but money and power have a way of changing
1529500	1530500	things.
1530500	1535020	I'd like to see him and the IGF investigated and better governed in years to come so people
1535020	1538600	outside Boye's inner circle of investors are given a fair shake.
1538600	1540740	I wholeheartedly agree with this.
1540740	1544300	There's not enough evidence to say that Brandon Boye was the undisputed direct cause of all
1544300	1548740	the corruption in the IGF, but in my opinion, there is enough evidence to show a pattern
1548740	1553940	of changing rules and behaviours that seem to benefit Boye and his friends disproportionately.
1553980	1558620	I don't buy that it's a simple coincidence that after Boye arrives in the scene, rules
1558620	1563340	are changed that allow his friends' games to win finalist nominations and awards, all
1563340	1568420	the while the IGF's loudest critics suddenly go silent as one of their own, a fellow journalist,
1568420	1569620	ascends the throne.
1569620	1573420	Brandon Boye's ethically shaky actions seem to extend beyond the IGF as well.
1573420	1577780	In Alistair Pynsoff's interview, he mentions talking to Tiff Chow in 2011, who bragged
1577780	1581940	that her boyfriend, Steph Therrien, would win Fantastic Arcade's Best Game Award, another
1581940	1586400	award show that Brandon Boye runs, due to Steph and Brandon's friendship.
1586400	1588860	And sure enough, Steph's game won.
1588860	1593980	However, on a follow-up article on Kotaku, Tiff denies ever saying that, and Kotaku considered
1593980	1594980	the matter closed.
1594980	1597820	Well, that's some quality reporting work there, Totelo.
1597820	1602080	When you were earning your masters in journalism, which professor taught you that a he-said-she-said
1602080	1604460	scenario was proof enough for you to drop a subject?
1604460	1607700	Well don't worry about it, Steven, camera lady did the work for you.
1607700	1611080	Around the same time as Brandon was running the Fantastic Arcade's award show that Steph
1611080	1616000	would later win, he also wrote a number of articles on the website Offworld, promoting
1616000	1617000	Steph's games.
1617000	1621160	Gamergate will know Offworld as the website Lea Alexander relocated her megaphone to after
1621160	1625080	she gracefully resigned from Gamasutra, of entirely her own accord, I'm sure.
1625080	1629080	A large number of social media posts show Brandon and Steph are friends as well, the
1629080	1634760	posts going far beyond normal industry chatter and discussing dinners, concerts, casual hanging
1634760	1638680	out, collaborating on projects, and explicit declarations of friendship.
1638680	1642600	And all of this stuff doesn't only apply to Brandon and Steph's friendship, either.
1642600	1646200	Just looking at Brandon's Offworld articles uncovers a massive amount of conflicts of
1646200	1647200	interest.
1647200	1650720	Here's one of his articles, 20 Games You Shouldn't Miss in 2014.
1650720	1655680	Of those 20, five games were made by individuals that can be proven to be Brandon's personal
1655680	1656680	friends.
1656680	1660880	Fjords by Kyle Reimergarten, HoHoCum by Honey Slug, which his friend Ricky Haggit works
1660880	1666720	for, How Do You Do It? by Nina Freeman, Pale Machine by Ben Esposito, and Sports Friends
1666720	1671520	by Dai Goot Fabric, which his friend Douglas Wilson works for.
1671520	1674880	Recommending their games isn't necessarily a conflict of interest, however recommending
1674880	1678560	their games and not disclosing friendships with the developers is.
1678560	1681720	And this really is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Brandon Boye.
1681720	1685960	Camera Lady cut her investigation of Brandon's time at Offworld short, mainly because this
1685960	1689600	video is already coming out late and she wanted me to record this as soon as possible.
1689600	1692840	But it seems like everything he sticks his fingers into becomes corrupt.
1692840	1698520	The IGF, Fantastic Arcade, his lack of disclosure in his writing, hell even in Indiecade Brandon
1698520	1699520	gives Steph an award.
1699520	1703520	We already know how much of a shitshow Indiecade is, add Brandon Boye to it and you might as
1703520	1705760	well burn the whole thing down, it's over.
1705760	1710000	Before I move on from Brandon I want to point out something that some people have noticed,
1710000	1714200	namely his funding campaign to fight his cancer, and how many people in the industry donated
1714200	1715200	to it.
1715200	1719760	We decided not to investigate this as a potential source of corruption for two reasons.
1719760	1723960	One, because if it were so, Brandon would have to use the money he received on something
1723960	1728000	other than cancer, and that is pretty much unprovable without either Brandon or a hospital
1728000	1730800	staff for leaking confidential records.
1730800	1733640	And two, because we're not heartless monsters.
1733640	1738460	Our investigations into Brandon Boye are regarding his professional conduct and seeing how some
1738460	1741320	personal relationships may negatively influence it.
1741320	1744560	We have nothing personally against him, and regardless of what he may or may not have
1744560	1746120	done, we hope he gets well.
1746120	1750120	Of course, while it seems like Brandon Boye is a massive red flag for the IGF and wider
1750120	1754200	industry all in his own, the IGF's issues don't stop with him.
1754200	1755920	Remember IndieFund?
1755920	1759320	We discussed their involvement in our bigger fish to fry video, but I'll give you a quick
1759320	1760920	rundown right now.
1760920	1764800	IndieFund is a group of people who band together to invest in indie game ideas that they think
1764800	1766120	show merit.
1766120	1770080	It sounds like a noble goal, until those same investors find themselves in positions of
1770080	1774560	power at various award shows and are therefore able to ensure a bigger kickback of profits
1774560	1777440	garnered from the increased sales that an award provides.
1777440	1778960	But it goes beyond Fez.
1778960	1784000	IndieFund Games seem to get a disproportionate number of IGF and IndieCade wins and nominations.
1784000	1787520	I'm sure the program's founders would claim that that's how it should be, that IndieFund
1787520	1791640	funds the best games, and that the award shows awards the best games.
1791640	1795600	So at the end of the day, it's simply quality bubbling to the surface.
1795600	1797400	But I don't think this is how it is.
1797400	1801180	When you look over the list of IndieFund-backed games, you begin to see some familiar indie
1801180	1802760	cabal names.
1802760	1805480	Here's Robin Arnott's game, no surprise he got funded.
1805480	1807760	Here's Framed, one of Zoe Quinn's games.
1807760	1812080	Oh, and here's a game by good ol' Steph Therrien, Brandon Boye's pal from earlier.
1812080	1816160	To an outsider like me, and I must assume to many smaller devs who are trying to get
1816160	1820120	started in the industry, IndieFund looks like a group of friends funding the games of other
1820120	1824860	friends while more friends give them awards, while the little people, the people who code
1824860	1829240	out of their living room, the people outside of the clique, the people who pay for a fair
1829240	1832360	shake at these contests and never get it, get the shaft.
1832360	1835840	And speaking of Framed, it won in the IGF twice.
1835840	1837680	Well holy shit, how'd that go down?
1837680	1843000	I mean, I thought after the gigantic shitstorm a few years ago, when Fez won in 2008 and
1843000	1847480	then entered into the IGF again in 2012, the rules were changed to prevent that.
1847480	1851880	Well no, Brandon Boye decided to make 2012 a transitional year, so the rules would be
1851880	1856640	fully changed in 2013, and Fez would be allowed to win a second time in 2012, but okay okay,
1856640	1859040	after that, no games winning twice.
1859040	1860600	Well shit Zoe, how'd you pull it off?
1860600	1866560	Oh I see, Framed won in IGF China, and then later in the main IGF.
1866560	1870760	Well that's a damn fine way to skirt the rules, and amongst IndieFund games, it's not just
1870760	1874920	Framed and Fez that were nominated as finalists or won in the IGF twice.
1874920	1879360	There was Antichamber, which was nominated in 2012, which also garnered a nomination
1879360	1881800	in 2011 under the name Hazard.
1881800	1885400	Is that all you have to do to get around the rules, just change your game's name?
1885400	1888920	To shift gears a bit, everyone remember Tim Schafer making an ass of himself at this year's
1888920	1889960	awards ceremony?
1889960	1894040	Did you know Tim Schafer, who is the physical spitting image of what all these antis say
1894040	1895780	the average gamer gator is?
1895780	1899840	It did feel pretty good that he mentioned us in a roundabout way, with this jab at our
1899840	1901680	video revealing the IGF's corruption.
1901680	1905880	He seems to think we're an indie dev in that joke though, but no, we're outsiders to the
1905880	1906880	industry.
1906880	1911280	And as outsiders to the industry, it seems to us like IndieFund exists to fund the projects
1911280	1912480	of Cabal members.
1912480	1915560	Matthew Wagner's the guy that comes up a few times in this video series.
1915560	1919740	Recall, he funded Fez, and later became one of the principal people behind IndieFund.
1919740	1922580	He also heads up his own studio, Flashbang Studios.
1922580	1925980	He's also a co-chair and regular judge and juror in the IGF.
1925980	1930040	As far as I know, Wagner doesn't work for Double Fine, Tim Schafer's studio, but for
1930040	1934660	some reason he does have access to Double Fine's Kickstarter financial data, which he
1934660	1937380	proudly showed off in February of 2012.
1937380	1942000	So at the very least, there's some type of undisclosed partnership or financial relationship
1942000	1943860	between Wagner and Double Fine.
1943860	1948580	Now, Tim Schafer's white guy accusing black guys of being white guys on the internet sock
1948580	1951460	puppet routine isn't the only dumb thing he's done.
1951460	1955360	Everybody and their grandma knows about Schafer taking Kickstarter funds and failing to deliver,
1955360	1959980	but as it turns out, quite a few Double Fine employees are also judges across multiple
1959980	1960980	years.
1960980	1964980	Considering that Matthew Wagner coded the IGF's judging software as an IGF judge and
1964980	1969460	juror repeatedly over the course of the festival's history, has a financial interest in seeing
1969460	1974380	all IndieFund games get as many awards and nominations as possible, and has some undisclosed
1974380	1978820	business and or financial link to Double Fine, is it no surprise to anybody that Double
1978820	1983120	Fine employees start showing up repeatedly on the juror lists, or that Tim Schafer waddled
1983120	1987100	on stage at the awards ceremony to make fun of people who dare question the actions of
1987100	1988340	him and his pals?
1988340	1991540	Let's keep going, what the fuck, I mean we're already this far in right?
1991540	1995260	Here's an indie game called Hundreds that proudly displays its three honorable mentions
1995260	2000640	in 2013's IGF, most notably Excellence in Visual Art, as well as its official selection
2000640	2002100	in IndieCade 2012.
2002100	2009060	Two of Hundreds devs are Adam Saltzman, AdamAtomic on Twitter, and Greg Wohlhand, A-E-I-O-W-U
2009060	2010060	on Twitter.
2010060	2015780	One of the IGF jurors in 2013, in the Excellence in Visual Art category, is Richard Hogg.
2015780	2020940	And wouldn't you know it, both Hogg and Wohlhand work for Saltzman's company, Finji, where
2020940	2024860	Saltzman mentions that one of the projects he's worked on is Fez, as well as Hogg having
2024860	2029800	worked on HoHoCome, a game that was nominated in the IGF while another of its devs was friends
2029800	2031040	with Brandon Boye.
2031040	2035380	And just to round this all into a neat little package, remember Maddy Brice?
2035380	2039480	Woman who outright said, downvoting all games with men in them as an IGF judge, and then
2039480	2045020	was shocked, SHOCKED, that she received enough backlash to it that the IGF removed her from
2045020	2046440	her position as judge?
2046440	2051540	And I do mean removed, rather than resigned in protest, despite what the IGF's apology
2051540	2055200	piece said at the end about her being welcome to return if she'd like.
2055200	2060120	Well, that apology piece was written by a person our anonymous indie dev says is named
2060120	2061120	Scavio.
2061120	2067200	Scavio refers to Megan Scavio, the GM of GDC, and our anonymous friend has quite a bit to
2067200	2068200	say about her.
2068200	2073360	Scavio did write the apology piece, which twisted around so absurdly that she said the
2073360	2078320	IGF's actions did nothing for Gamergate, when in reality, the IGF did the only thing
2078320	2081460	Gamergate wanted, which was to enforce objectivity.
2081460	2086280	The anonymous dev also says Scavio is a personal friend of Lea Alexander's, and she's been
2086280	2091600	attempting to exert further reach than the GDC's show manager allows, and that Scavio
2091600	2094600	was responsible for Tim Schafer's sock puppet joke.
2094600	2099820	Scavio has been trying to push into the volunteer program, and she's also known to give preference
2099820	2104880	to her friends for talks including those who are literally rehashing presentations from
2104880	2109220	other people applying, and that her qualifications are nebulous at best.
2109220	2114280	When asked to clarify, the anonymous dev said that Scavio would regularly threaten GDC's
2114280	2117720	conference associates with expulsion if they didn't tow the party line.
2117720	2123600	They also clarified that despite Scavio browbeating the conference associates, or CAs, the GDC
2123600	2125800	is run by them behind the scenes.
2125800	2127800	Well, what are conference associates?
2127800	2129680	Maybe the GDC's website can help.
2129680	2133960	So, your crowdfunding missed its target, you're a student with limited funds, your company
2133960	2136200	can't send you, or you just want to lend a hand.
2136200	2140480	Whatever the reason, you may still be able to attend this premiere event by becoming
2140480	2141960	a conference associate.
2141960	2143760	Are you willing to earn your attendance?
2143760	2147080	Oh, so that's what conference associates are.
2147080	2149120	Indie devs who are outside the clique.
2149120	2152300	This page reads like the propaganda pamphlet to a pyramid scheme.
2152300	2156800	The GDC relies on the labor of those outside of the indie cabal in order to function, and
2156800	2160200	hears Scavio coming down hard on them, telling them that they'd better not step out of line
2160200	2162280	if they want to have a future in game development.
2162280	2163800	What a surprise.
2163800	2168640	It sounds to me like Megan Scavio got hired on at the GDC not due to any sort of qualification,
2168640	2169960	but because of who she knew.
2169960	2173520	That she's been rejecting potential speakers at GDC only to turn around and give their
2173520	2176880	work to her friends to make panels out of instead, and that she's been trying to push
2176880	2181040	herself into managerial areas that her job title doesn't cover, presumably out of some
2181040	2182820	kind of authoritarian power trip.
2182820	2187680	I am under no illusion that what I'm about to suggest will solve all the IGF's problems
2187680	2188680	overnight.
2188680	2194560	But, before the next IGF opens its doors, Brandon Boye needs to step down from the position
2194560	2195560	of chairman.
2195560	2199600	The IGF rules need to be examined and changed appropriately.
2199600	2203720	The judging software of the IGF needs to be audited by a third party.
2203720	2208600	And given that the IGF operates out of California, the IGF needs to be compliant with state law
2208600	2213920	regarding contests and regulations for entrant fairness, which states that, misrepresenting
2213920	2217720	in any manner the odds of winning any prize is prohibited.
2217720	2221780	And if after an extensive review of the IGF by an outside party reveals this law to have
2221780	2226120	been broken, legal action must be taken against the parties involved.
2226120	2229960	And if you're an indie dev listening to this, yes, I'll repeat my now tired refrain of
2229960	2232380	please come forward and tell us what you've seen.
2232380	2237120	But also, if you're an indie dev not in the cool kids club, the indie gaming inner circle,
2237120	2241600	and you're considering entering your game into the next IGF, don't.
2241600	2244280	Do you know what your hundred dollar entry fee is doing?
2244280	2245600	It's keeping the Cabal up and running.
2245600	2248800	You're paying for their rent, and you're not even getting the one thing you bought
2248800	2249800	in return.
2249800	2251360	A fair shake at the prize.
2251360	2254360	And if you're hoping to get funding from Indie Fund, again, don't.
2254360	2257080	It seems like they won't take your game no matter how good it is because you're
2257080	2258240	not in the clique.
2258240	2260540	I don't know how else to say this, guys.
2260540	2263720	These people aren't looking out for your interests, they don't give a shit about
2263720	2264720	your games.
2264720	2266800	To them, you're nothing but a source of revenue.
2266800	2270960	Your entry fees keep them going, and they're banking on your hope and optimism pushing
2270960	2273200	you to come back against your better judgement.
2273200	2274700	Don't let them do it to you.
2274700	2279860	To end this off, Robert Yang was a first time IGF judge in 2014, and he wrote a blog post
2279860	2281200	about his experiences.
2281200	2283680	He talks about the IGF's strengths and weaknesses.
2283680	2286920	He encourages people to speak out against the IGF if they think they're doing a bad
2286920	2287920	job.
2287920	2290720	But most importantly, he talks about the IGF's alternatives.
2290720	2291720	He says,
2291720	2295560	The IGF used to be one of the most important things ever, the Academy Awards or Sundance
2295560	2296560	of games.
2296560	2300260	But it was always a strange idea that indie developers would fight to decentralize power
2300260	2302720	and then put all this prestige into this central institution.
2302720	2304420	Well, I'm pretty sure I know why.
2304420	2307920	Phil Fish said so himself back in the Rock Paper Shotgun article on the topic.
2307920	2311820	Back when the first waves of indies were new, they saw the injustices of the industry,
2311820	2313400	and they wanted a level playing field.
2313400	2316280	And once they got their level playing field, they promptly built a new industry right on
2316280	2317280	top of it.
2317280	2321060	A new bureaucratic structure to benefit them, while the generation of indies after them
2321060	2324860	is now stuck with looking at two giant corrupt systems instead of only one.
2324860	2329120	We saw it happen with Occupy, we saw it happen with Project Chanology, hell, we even saw
2329120	2333160	it happen with the fucking 18th century French intellectual movement.
2333160	2337040	Social misfits acting in the name of equality will unite under their shared experience of
2337040	2340560	misfithood, and then emulate the power structures of those that declared them misfits in the
2340560	2344400	first place, solely to wield authority over the next generation of misfits that comes
2344400	2345400	along.
2345400	2349400	Yang goes on to say that one of the IGF's benefits, a steam deal, is becoming less exclusive
2349400	2353360	over time, and that the attention the IGF garners is beginning to be usurped by the
2353360	2356000	sheer audience and reach of the popular YouTubers.
2356000	2357000	And I have to agree with him.
2357000	2360560	If you're a small indie dev, and you're looking over the content of this video, and
2360560	2364640	you're just completely dismayed at the giant brick wall you see in front of you, don't
2364640	2365640	lose hope.
2365640	2368920	Don't pay a hundred bucks to enter your game into a rigged award show you'll never
2368920	2369920	win.
2369920	2374160	Send a review copy of your game off to Total Biscuit, or Angry Joe, or whoever else instead.
2374160	2377880	Don't support the old corrupt structures when your own customers are providing you
2377880	2379200	with viable alternatives.
2379200	2383100	Alistair Pintsov even said in his interview that journalists first rejected YouTubers
2383100	2386680	who reached out to them, then began to attack them as their popularity grew, and now are
2386680	2390040	desperately trying to emulate them as their old media methods crumble.
2390040	2391040	You don't need them.
2391040	2396040	A vocal anti-gamergate individual, Jen Frank of all people, wrote a reply on Unwinnable
2396040	2400800	to the allegations of IGF corruption, basically saying, I was an awesome IGF judge, and everything
2400800	2404040	was awesome, and the only reason I didn't play a game was because it was broken and
2404040	2405040	wouldn't install.
2405040	2406040	Hello.
2406040	2407040	Goodbye.
2407040	2410380	Camera Lady, along with a different anonymous indie dev than the one we've consistently
2410380	2414680	mentioned in this video, looked into the game Jen Klein was broken, and wouldn't install.
2414680	2418600	It became clear to both of them that she didn't actually play the game because the game was
2418600	2420160	on iOS.
2420160	2423840	A plug and play platform that requires no install process.
2423840	2429840	Anonymous Dev 2 also says, right after this incident, the IGF dropped TestFlight, an application
2429840	2432680	that monitored how long the judges actually played the games.
2432680	2436360	I guess they didn't want to see how little the IGF judges actually gave a shit.
2436360	2439400	But this wasn't why I brought up Jen Frank or her laughable article.
2439400	2441240	I bring it up because of what she says here.
2441240	2445640	If you think IGF judging doesn't work, find me a better system and I will lay off.
2445640	2446640	I'll just go.
2446640	2449160	In fact, I'll never write about video games again.
2449160	2453440	And a bit later, if you honestly feel that your flame is trapped in a vacuum, move on.
2453440	2454440	Just go.
2454440	2456080	There are other communities that will accept you.
2456080	2457360	Create your own system.
2457360	2458440	Make your own clubhouse.
2458440	2459520	I dare you.
2459520	2461840	The absolute arrogance here is astounding.
2461840	2463480	She sounds like an abusive lover.
2463480	2465640	Hey indies, I dare you to leave us.
2465640	2466700	I dare you.
2466700	2467700	You need us.
2467700	2468700	You'll never go.
2468700	2471280	Well, indie devs, it's time for you to call that bluff.
2471280	2472720	The IGF doesn't care about you.
2472720	2477240	It cares about Brandon Boyer's friends, and Tim Schafer's friends, and Matthew Wagner's
2477240	2479280	friends, and Phil Fish's friends.
2479280	2480800	It doesn't care about indies.
2480800	2484820	It cares about people who were indies 10 years ago and have now become part of the establishment
2484820	2486960	while not wanting to take off the indie hat.
2486960	2488400	You are nothing to them.
2488400	2491200	They're daring you to leave, thinking they'll never do it.
2491200	2492480	Those losers need us.
2492480	2493480	We have the power.
2493480	2495040	But there is a new clubhouse.
2495040	2497240	We're offering it to you, right here and now.
2497240	2500140	Turn away from these sycophants and never look back.
2500140	2505360	And hey, Jen Frank, when the indie devs get fed up with your inflammatory bullshit and
2505360	2509140	leave you and your clique of corrupt friends high and dry, I expect you to hold up your
2509140	2511960	end of the bargain and never write about video games again.
2511960	2517520	We'll all be better off for it.
2517520	2518520	That's all for today, guys.
2518520	2521120	It wasn't just camera lady sleuthing in my reading that brought this video together.
2521120	2522120	A lot of us worked on it.
2522120	2525900	Special thanks to Derek Smart for willing to discuss issues rather than simply mudslinging.
2525900	2529420	As well as to our two anonymous indie devs, who asked to remain anonymous because they
2529420	2533400	legitimately fear for their jobs and careers by speaking out against the IGF and all these
2533400	2534400	individuals.
2534440	2538080	Special thanks to William Usher, who helped providing us with some contacts, and Thryden,
2538080	2543340	Stealth Suit, Krios, and somebody only by the name of Temporary Account 2 for providing
2543340	2544880	some of the information and leads.
2544880	2548120	And a very special thanks to three people who actually gave us money to keep this show
2548120	2549120	going.
2549120	2552220	Pasquale Festa, Hente Logic, and the late and great King of Pole.
2552220	2554920	At this point, I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about something else.
2554920	2558480	It's only slightly related to Gamergate, so if you want to check out now, that's completely
2558480	2559480	fine.
2559480	2560480	Feel free to do so.
2560480	2562420	There's no hard feelings from myself or camera at all.
2562440	2565120	I'm sure this video's gone on long enough as it is.
2565120	2568400	Camera Lady recently had a conversation over on the Let's Play subreddit.
2568400	2572380	As I'm sure you know, we also post Let's Plays, anime reviews, and other stuff on this channel,
2572380	2574820	along with these indefensible videos.
2574820	2578620	Somebody with 20,000 subscribers and 3 million views started a thread about how to grow your
2578620	2582380	channel, so camera asked some questions about it looking how to grow our short pet otaku
2582380	2587860	channel here, and was promptly tore into for supporting Gamergate, accusing us of simply
2587860	2592460	using Gamergate and not contributing to it, shilling on the hashtag, being misogynist,
2592460	2593460	and so on.
2593460	2597980	We always wanted to do a video, or at least talk at the end of a Gamergate video, introducing
2597980	2601260	us and our other content to our new Gamergate subscribers.
2601260	2604940	But this conversation made us think long and hard about what we should be saying.
2604940	2608340	We don't want to appear as shills, we don't want to appear like we're just using Gamergate
2608340	2609780	for attention.
2609780	2613940	If we were, I don't think we'd be doing this much investigative work in these videos that
2613940	2614940	we make.
2614940	2619740	But at the same time, we do want to promote ourselves, to promote our other types of videos,
2619740	2622140	and generally just to grow as a channel.
2622140	2625140	It's no secret that we take money and gifts from people willing to give them to us.
2625140	2628740	I want to take a minute here and outline exactly what we do with what we get, and why it's
2628740	2631980	relevant to our Gamergate video series, not just our other stuff.
2631980	2634260	To start off, yes we have a Patreon.
2634260	2637820	It's at, predictably, patreon.com slash short pet otaku.
2637820	2641580	For anybody interested in giving not on a monthly basis, but only once, we also have
2641580	2645540	a paypal account under the email shortpetotaku at hotmail.com.
2645540	2649380	And we have publicly posted our address for physical gifts, but I don't think I'm going
2649380	2651180	to provide that in a Gamergate video.
2651180	2654380	Now in the interest of transparency, I'm going to provide you with a list of rules we've
2654380	2657740	set for ourselves regarding the money that we get from you, mainly because we're from
2657740	2661900	the old guard of the internet that always saw money making on the internet as sketchy,
2661900	2664820	and social media not being anonymous as a massive mistake.
2664820	2669280	Rule one, we don't want anybody to feel pressured to give us anything, ever.
2669280	2672080	If you want to give us anything, or can't afford to give us anything, it will never
2672080	2673880	ever be held against you.
2673880	2676640	If you want to run ad blockers in our videos, same deal.
2676640	2680520	I don't ever want anybody to feel excluded from our channel, our content, or any kind
2680520	2684100	of community going around us because they can't or won't give money.
2684100	2685100	Everybody is welcome here.
2685100	2689520	Rule two, we have patreon set to monthly because we're actually a daily upload channel, and
2689520	2691620	setting it to per video is a bit ridiculous.
2691620	2696600	This isn't like so many journalists or developers or mid-tier e-celebs out there who simply
2696600	2699980	set it to monthly, do next to nothing, and rake in the dough.
2699980	2701800	We are always posting something.
2701800	2708040	Rule three, 100% of any money you give us, on patreon, or paypal, or through ad revenue,
2708040	2709520	will be used on our channel.
2709520	2710520	Period.
2710520	2711520	No exceptions.
2711520	2712760	We don't intend to live off of your generosity.
2712760	2717320	We have a wish list of sound equipment, lighting equipment, camera equipment, and games and
2717320	2718600	anime we like to do videos on.
2718600	2722800	You will not see us rake in 13k a month and then brag about getting a new motorcycle on
2722800	2723800	twitter.
2723800	2724800	Like some people.
2724800	2729680	As a sub rule, whenever we're given a physical gift, like a game or anime, we'll guarantee
2729680	2730680	you'll get videos on it.
2730680	2734640	The Bible Black DVD set was given to us as a gift from a fan, and we made six riff videos
2734640	2735680	out of it so far.
2735680	2740340	If you are generous enough to give to us, we feel it is our responsibility to give back
2740340	2741820	to you in kind.
2741820	2746640	Rule four, we will post the receipts of any purchase made with your money on the short
2746640	2747960	Fedotaku twitter account.
2747960	2753040	As an example, we spent $90 on an SNES flashcard using YouTube ad revenue, and Dave put up
2753040	2754880	a picture of the receipt on twitter.
2754880	2759000	We intend to use the cart to revive a series called Game Roulette, the first two seasons
2759000	2760660	of which can be found on our channel.
2760660	2765400	Over the years we have also purchased an AT2020 microphone, an Elgato, a Dazzle, and several
2765400	2768440	older consoles using BlipTV ad revenue.
2768440	2772440	You will always know what we're doing with your money and which purchases contribute
2772440	2773840	to which of our projects.
2773840	2780400	Rule five, yes, this stuff will also help Indefensible as a series grow, not just our
2780400	2781840	let's plays and reviews.
2781840	2786720	Hamerlady estimates $300 to update our audio equipment, which we intend to use to improve
2786720	2790160	our gamergate video's audio quality as well as our other projects.
2790160	2794600	The editing PC and potentially even the new camera will also expand what we can do for
2794600	2795600	Indefensible.
2795600	2799060	It's true that your money will be going towards our other projects, but it will simultaneously
2799060	2801440	also be going towards new gamergate videos.
2801440	2805080	If you're interested in giving, but you're on the fence because you only watch us for
2805080	2809160	gamergate, don't worry, your money will go towards gamergate.
2809160	2813280	Rule six, this bears saying a second time, nobody has to give.
2813280	2818040	The truth of it is, if we got exactly zero dollars from anybody, we would still upload
2818040	2819040	daily.
2819040	2820200	The let's plays would still come.
2820200	2821880	The anime reviews would still be coming.
2821880	2825520	We'd still try to put out Indefensible once a week, though I don't know how successful
2825520	2826520	we'd be.
2826520	2829740	If you're somebody who just does not give a shit about our channel outside of gamergate
2829740	2833720	and does not care to give us anything to improve our gamergate videos, that's still fine with
2833720	2834720	us.
2834720	2835720	You'll always be welcome here.
2835720	2839200	We never want to become that asshole who shits on his viewerbase for not doing enough
2839200	2840200	or whatever.
2840200	2843320	We leave the option to give it to us open to you if you like our content and feel inclined
2843320	2846440	to do so, and we will never look down on somebody who doesn't.
2846440	2850120	The way I see it is the internet has a lot of huge gaping money pits.
2850120	2852180	Some of them are good causes, a lot of them aren't.
2852180	2855320	If you decide to throw some into ours, I can promise you that we'll be grateful and that
2855320	2858120	we'll put your money to good use investing in our channel, and if that doesn't appeal
2858120	2859240	to you, that's okay too.
2859240	2861280	Please stay and enjoy whatever videos you want.
2861280	2862280	Well, that's my pitch.
2862280	2864120	I don't know how strong it is, but there it is.
2864120	2868040	If you're interested, the paypal email is shortpilotaka.com and the Patreon is under
2868040	2869040	shortpilotaka.
2869040	2871320	And if you're not, thanks for listening this far anyway.
2871320	2875040	We hope to get up another indefensible video in about a week and a half's time, camera
2875040	2878560	lady sleuthing dug up several more topics of interest that weren't related to the IGF,
2878560	2881000	so it's going to be a whole lot of fun in the coming weeks.
2881000	2884920	And if you want to see me and Dave sooner, come check out our other stuff.
2884920	2885640	We upload daily.
