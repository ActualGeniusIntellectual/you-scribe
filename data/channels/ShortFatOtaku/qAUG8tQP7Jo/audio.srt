1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
This video is not meant to be a statement of absolute fact, nor does it exist to directly

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,120
accuse anybody of anything.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,600
Rather, it's a presentation of the evidence that we've discovered and an open call for

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,840
others on both the inside and out to discuss the issues explored therein.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,760
Furthermore, any audio accompanied by the Devon no-talent gaming artwork can be considered

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,760
to be entirely our own opinion or conjecture on a topic.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,600
Thank you and enjoy!

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,320
Hey guys, Dev here.

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,540
I hope you all enjoyed the April Fools video, I'm sorry this one's a bit later than usual,

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,280
we actually had it finished by Saturday, but camera lady's computer shit out on her for

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,280
a few days.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,680
I hope you've all seen our video on the IGDA, because this serves as an unofficial sequel

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,680
to it.

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,580
After our video dropped, we received the usual backlash.

15
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,880
People inside who are clearly anti-Gamergate, simply calling us misogynists and whatever

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,320
for daring to question the current power structure.

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,880
But camera lady got to talking with one notable individual on the inside who wasn't actually

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,600
interested in baselessly slinging mud, and his name was Derek Smart.

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,720
Now Derek's no stranger to gamergate.

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,040
Earlier this month some info surfaced regarding the IGDA's head, Kate Edwards.

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,780
She's trans, and was known as Tom Edwards before her transition.

22
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,840
I want to make this absolutely clear, this is not about Kate being trans.

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,920
I bring this up solely to show that she performed actions when she was known as Tom, that have

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,260
bearings on her current business as Kate.

25
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,660
Any comment or criticism directed towards Kate has nothing to do with her status as

26
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,740
a trans woman.

27
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,740
As Tom Edwards, she founded her own consulting firm, Englobe, which later had its name changed

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,860
to Geografie.

29
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,700
As Kate Edwards, she became the executive director of the IGDA.

30
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,580
Geografie, the consulting firm Kate Edwards owns, is contracted to do consulting for the

31
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,980
IGDA, the organization Kate Edwards currently heads up.

32
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,260
This seems like a very obvious conflict of interest, with the well-known gamergate lawyer

33
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,820
Mike Cernovich saying it sounds illegal.

34
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,940
And here's where Derek Smart comes in.

35
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,300
Derek wrote a reply to both our video and this new information regarding Kate Edwards

36
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,300
owning Geografie.

37
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,340
Let me go over a few important bits.

38
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,820
Derek says he listens to both sides of gamergate and tries to have reasonable discourse.

39
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,940
Based on his conversation with Camera Lady, I'd say that's the truth.

40
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,260
He's equally welcoming and critical to both gamergate supporters and anti-GGers and seems

41
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,180
to be willing to talk to just about anybody.

42
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,620
Derek says, in more words, that his experiences with the IGDA have shown him that they're

43
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,620
on the level.

44
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,300
Derek discusses the Geografie claims, stating that given the seriousness and nature of the

45
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,780
allegations and knowing that nobody was going to respond, I took it upon myself to get to

46
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,820
the bottom of it.

47
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,900
If Kate Edwards was one woman holding two positions, who got hired to those two positions

48
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,900
independently of her involvement in the other, and then afterwards suddenly the IGDA is doing

49
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,740
business with Geografie, that would be illegal.

50
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,820
But Derek says that Kate is not actually employed by the IGDA, but rather she is employed by

51
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,260
Geografie and is contracted out to the IGDA as its chairman.

52
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,300
I've personally seen this happen a lot in multiple industries, where a worker will be

53
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,300
employed by a firm that exists specifically to rent workers out to other companies.

54
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,820
A simple way to describe this is like so, Kate doesn't hold positions of power in

55
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:27,980
both Geografie and the IGDA, and she doesn't use that to funnel money from one to the other.

56
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,920
Kate holds a position of power in Geografie, and the IGDA pays Geografie for Kate to also

57
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,100
hold a position of power and manage the IGDA.

58
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,220
Her management is literally what the IGDA is paying Geografie for.

59
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,740
Now Derek doesn't offer any proof of his claims, but I honestly don't think he's

60
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,740
able to.

61
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,580
He's not going to have access to Kate Edwards contract, and even if he did I doubt he'd

62
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,940
legally be able to publish it.

63
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,620
Is it possible that Derek's lying, or was misinformed by the people he spoke to to get

64
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,620
his information?

65
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,620
Sure.

66
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,100
But the fact that he is one of the only people with any connections that has been consistently

67
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,780
open minded and reasonable makes me want to trust him, and I'm also not willing to completely

68
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,340
backstab and alienate a guy because I have a predetermined outcome regarding the IGDA

69
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,620
and his reply doesn't fit it.

70
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,580
We can't ask for insiders to come forward and then accuse them of lying or covering

71
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,880
things up when they give us answers we don't want to hear.

72
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,060
Not without proof.

73
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,340
If Derek's either lying or misinformed, then Kate Edwards is actually doing some pretty

74
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,340
corrupt shit.

75
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,780
Kate would be in a position to move money from the non-profit IGDA to her own personal

76
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,780
company.

77
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,180
And even if Kate's entirely on the level, the fact that her company was given the contract

78
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,020
over others that may be just as capable is corruption in itself.

79
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,540
However, if Derek's correct, and I think he is, then what he has to say lines up with

80
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,060
the anonymous indie dev from the last video that claimed Kate and the IGDA isn't corrupt,

81
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,060
but just a bit flip-floppy.

82
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,380
However, even with Derek telling the truth, I do think there's a bit of a problem with

83
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,140
Geogrify, even if it's only a minor one.

84
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,700
Geogrify does consulting for not only the IGDA, but also several games studios.

85
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,220
I'm not sure if it's appropriate for the same company to have its hands in the management

86
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,420
of both the studios and the organization that exists to stand up for the rights of those

87
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,560
studios' employees, but this seems to be minor and is nothing like any sort of money

88
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,600
funneling that we all initially thought.

89
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,740
As for the IGDA's connection to UBM's other properties like the IGF and GDC, Derek and

90
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,620
Camera actually agree that the connections looked bad, but having the potential for something

91
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,960
to go wrong is not the same as something actually going wrong, and Derek wants to default to

92
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,260
trust the people running things until they prove they can't be trusted.

93
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,920
At the same time, Derek admitted to knowing nothing about the IGF side of the equation,

94
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,220
as he doesn't deal with them.

95
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:39,420
Even if the IGDA is completely innocent, IGF has more than enough corrupt bullshit happening

96
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,580
inside to cover the entire UBM family anyway.

97
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,980
A little while back, Alistair Pinsauf gave an interview on TechRaptor regarding what

98
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,560
he knows about the IGF.

99
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,540
He says that a lot of what we had initially dug up was somewhat inaccurate, but there

100
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,500
was enough truth there that he had to take a hard look back at his own experiences and

101
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,540
felt a moral imperative to come forward and share what he had witnessed.

102
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,740
I think his assessment of our video is fair.

103
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,260
We're not industry insiders.

104
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,420
Our lady is just a near-mute autist who is good at digging up info, and I can only read

105
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,420
what she gives me.

106
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,060
We can only go off of what we managed to sleuth up from the underbelly of the internet.

107
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,300
However, the video achieved its goal.

108
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,180
It got the gears turning inside the brains of many people inside the industry.

109
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,660
Indies, journalists, and judges have all come out both publicly and privately to say, something

110
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,300
fucked up happened with me during the IGF and I didn't think much of it until I saw

111
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,580
your video, and that's what we hoped would happen.

112
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,540
The truth of it is, we can't do much.

113
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,780
We can boycott sites and encourage others to do the same.

114
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,980
We can refuse to pay for games or refuse to play them, but reforming the IGF is only going

115
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,160
to happen if the indie devs who enter the IGF come together and demand it.

116
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,820
And we want IGF reform just as much as you do.

117
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,260
Not just so that undeserving games stop getting awards and therefore stop getting press coverage,

118
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,260
but also for every single indie developer who pays to enter the IGF not knowing that

119
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,500
they have no chance at winning regardless of the quality of their game, just because

120
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,180
they're not friends with the right people.

121
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,420
For the indie devs who want to speak out, who have seen injustices but fear retaliation.

122
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,780
For people like the anonymous indie dev we mentioned in the last video that spoke to

123
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,620
Camera Lady, who provided us with a major lead regarding the IGF.

124
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,540
They said to look into winners who were judges before they were winners.

125
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,560
Camera Lady mentioned the only reason that she and her friends had been able to show

126
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,100
judges being connected to winners was due to the Polytron leaked financial documents,

127
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,580
and without that knowledge it would be harder to do.

128
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,300
But the indie devs said not to look at years where a judge won a game in the same year,

129
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,180
but to find winners who were judges in all other years.

130
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:41,020
In essence, there's a group of indie devs that double as judges in the IGF every single

131
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,260
year except the years in which they enter a game.

132
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,780
And when a member of that group steps out of the judge pool in a given year to enter

133
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,680
a game, the other members of the group push that game through.

134
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,580
And the next year, the judge who received a boost last time around returns to the judge

135
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,340
pool to help push another member through.

136
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,840
Now I'd like to define some terms from the IGF itself using a statement they wrote in

137
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,620
reply to our original video.

138
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,540
In it, the difference between judge and juror is spelled out.

139
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,900
The judges are anonymous, and as of the latest IGF, number at approximately 375.

140
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,580
They're given a random selection of games to judge, but are also able to vote on any

141
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,380
other game in the pool that they'd like.

142
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,940
And although they don't say this in the statement, it's been confirmed by several other sources,

143
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,620
some we even used in the previous video, that it only takes a total of 8 years for

144
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,580
a game to move to the next round.

145
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,020
Meanwhile, the jurors are not anonymous.

146
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,320
Their announcement happens annually with some fanfare, almost as if they're considered celebrities.

147
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,420
And each juror is assigned to a specific award with the task of deciding the finalists and

148
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,340
ultimately the winner of that award from the pool of games that the judges all recommend

149
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,500
from the previous round.

150
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,760
In another statement, this time announcing the resignation of Maddy Brice, the IGF confirms

151
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,360
that a single individual can be both a judge and juror in the same year, by describing

152
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,720
her as performing both of these duties before leaving the IGF.

153
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,200
There's an obvious problem right away, if a game is already well known, it doesn't take

154
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,880
much for 8 judges to peruse the list, find the famous game, and give it an upvote.

155
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,360
Moreover, it's also no problem for 8 judges to come together and push a game through the

156
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,980
system regardless of its quality.

157
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,680
This is one of the reasons why Maddy Brice's infamous tweet describing her personal voting

158
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,840
metric as downvoting all games with men in them was considered to be extremely corrupt.

159
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,960
In any case, this gave us an obvious way forward, find the IGF judge and juror lists, see who

160
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,100
consistently judges every year except the years in which they enter a game, and see

161
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,480
if they consistently win awards every time they step out to enter.

162
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,520
It's not conclusive proof, but it's certainly a start.

163
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,280
Despite the IGF judges being considered anonymous nowadays, it wasn't always so.

164
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:48,040
The IGF used to publish their judge lists alongside their jury lists, specifically at

165
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,320
the URL www.igf.com slash judges.html.

166
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,340
This is relevant because each year, the judge list for that year would be published at the

167
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,920
exact same HTML file, overwriting the previous year's judge list.

168
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,920
Using the magical powers of the internet wayback machine, it actually becomes relatively easy

169
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,040
to catalog each year's judge list, all right from the same address.

170
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:18,120
The judge lists archived from www.igf.com slash judges.html are from 2006 to 2009.

171
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,280
But from 2010 onward, there's nothing but dead pages.

172
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,720
Camberlady began cataloging all of the judges into a spreadsheet to see when recurring judges

173
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,480
stepped away for a year, with the intention to cross-reference their stepping back with

174
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,000
the awards winners and finalists for that year.

175
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,280
But those missing judge lists from 2010 onward put a damper on the whole endeavor, don't

176
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,280
they?

177
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:42,680
Well here's some info at www.igf.com slash 2011juries.html.

178
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,160
But this seems a bit different, doesn't it?

179
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,760
People are grouped by awards and given extensive bios.

180
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,480
Ah, right, that would be because this is the juror list, not the judge list.

181
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,440
Remember, after 2011, the judge list had become private, and the jury list is released every

182
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,000
year with fanfare.

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,680
But from the IGF statement on Mati Bryce, we do know that many anonymous judges are

184
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,440
also public jurors.

185
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,320
There's still something odd about this though.

186
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,840
If you go to the public judge list back on the Internet Wayback Machine, you'll see

187
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,200
that they're collectively called the competition jury rather than judges.

188
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,560
Man, it's almost like the IGF just keeps shuffling their terminology around in order

189
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560
to confuse people.

190
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,080
Well, maybe this'll help.

191
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,320
In depth, demystifying the IGF judging process.

192
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:27,080
This was posted on IGF.com in January 2010 and was written by Jens Bergensten, otherwise

193
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,240
known as Jeb of Minecraft fam.

194
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,240
Now Jeb talks about being a judge in the current IGF, which was 2010 at the time, as well as

195
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,800
previous years, and that he's never gotten the luxury of a nomination at this point.

196
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,760
Well, the very next year, 2011, Jeb's game, Cobalt, gets nominated for Excellence in Audio

197
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
at the IGF.

198
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,880
And in 2012, Jeb tweets that he's been assigned to judge at the IGF again.

199
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,240
And again in 2013, Jeb tweets about his experience judging for the IGF, and how he finds the

200
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,960
good entries, sort by number of judge comments.

201
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,600
This does lend credence to Camera Lady's initial theory that well-known games, or developers,

202
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,760
aka those within the clique, entering the IGF have an inherent advantage over any kind

203
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,280
of new, truly indie dev, and that all it would take to force a game to the top of the pile

204
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,040
is a small number of judges coming together to give it a push.

205
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,460
I didn't even bring up Jeb with the intention of actually looking into him, but he fits

206
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,280
the bill of the rotating cabal of judges theory the anonymous dev put forward.

207
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:31,240
Jeb is a judge in the IGF in 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013, only skipping out on 2011 because

208
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,800
he had entered Cobalt.

209
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,760
And would you look at that, Cobalt got to advertise that it was an IGF finalist.

210
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,600
Jesus Christ, let me actually get to where I was going.

211
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,620
In Jeb's writing, he describes the differences between IGF 2009 and IGF 2010.

212
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,360
Starting in 2010, there was a nouveau category that judges could nominate games to via a

213
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,380
yes or no, which does potentially contradict what was written in the Maggie Bryce piece

214
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,300
regarding there being no downvoting in the judging process.

215
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,780
There were 150 judges in 2010, and they were anonymous.

216
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,720
You could only see the name of another judge if they commented on a game.

217
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,160
But Jeb says something of note, I was only allowed to score the games in my list, but

218
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,000
I could try the other games if I liked so I could gain perspective on the quality of

219
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
those titles.

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,920
It was also possible for me to write comments on the games.

221
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,260
This goes completely against what multiple sources have said that any judge can vote

222
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,260
on any game.

223
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,220
Jeb also talks about the finalist judging back in 2010, saying, following all of the

224
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,080
first round judging, the IGF judges have about a month to play all the finalists and

225
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,060
simply vote for their winner in each category.

226
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,760
No mention of a public division between anonymous judges and publicized jurors.

227
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,680
These are two interesting inconsistencies, which I want to address a bit later in the

228
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
video.

229
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,900
Alex May offers a second opinion in Jeb's piece.

230
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,260
He outright admits to being a judge in 2010 and a finalist in 2009, thanks for saving

231
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,020
camera some time there bro, and just like with Jeb, easily found tweets and articles

232
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,040
confirming he was also a judge and juror in 2011, 2012, and 2013.

233
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,980
Alex May admits to having approximately two days per game assigned to him, but decided

234
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,300
to leave it all until the last minute, and that based on the activity of the private

235
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,440
judging website, most other judges did the same.

236
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,180
This lines up with the Rotten Cartridges blog post, where an entrant describes how most

237
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,020
judges assigned to their game didn't actually play it, and how only one judge played it

238
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,820
for more than five minutes, and how he only received a response from the IGF after he

239
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,760
threatened to go public with the information.

240
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,560
The third opinion is written by Michael Rose, and to give him credit, he seems to do the

241
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,880
right thing.

242
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,680
He decided that the only way he was going to judge this list of games fairly was if

243
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,680
he played them from top to bottom, not picking out the ones I had already come across or

244
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,480
was previously excited to play.

245
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,840
The piece ends off with a word from Simon Carlos, the IGF chairman back in January of

246
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,220
2010.

247
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,720
He says, since the independent games festival is becoming so important to many small game

248
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,560
developers' lives, we're committed to transparency because we know that indie game creators

249
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,640
want to understand what is happening to their game in the process of IGF judging.

250
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,280
Of course, the IGF is no stranger to criticism.

251
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,200
It's not just Cameron Lady's digs, or the Rotten Cartridges blog post, or Team Meat's

252
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,440
podcast where they describe their judging experience being a complete shit show, or

253
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,120
Alistair Pynsoff, or any of the others who were inspired to step forward and talk after

254
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,180
a video is dropped.

255
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,360
The criticism goes back a long way, and used to actually come from the people that now

256
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,280
devoutly describe themselves as Gamergate's opposition.

257
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,760
Rock Paper Shotgun's Brandon Caldwell published The Story Behind the IGF's Critics, and in

258
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,600
it he talks to a developer and vocal IGF critic, Anna Anthropy.

259
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,240
Yes, the same Anna Anthropy whose personal friends, Patricia Hernandez and Lea Alexander,

260
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,600
wrote about without disclosing their friendships.

261
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,760
The same Anna Anthropy who is vehemently anti-Gamergate, and is in fact one of the corrupt individuals

262
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,920
GG investigated, was once vocal in her criticisms of the IGF.

263
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,560
The article talks about a pirate cart.

264
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,240
A large number of indie games all entered into the IGF as one game because they were

265
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,760
all contained within the same larger game, like in Action 52.

266
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,180
The article states that some see this as a protest against the IGF's unfit rules and

267
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,360
high entry fees.

268
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,600
Anna herself says it was definitely a reaction to Fez winning the grand prize at the IGF

269
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
two separate years.

270
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,240
It raised a lot of awareness both of these games that would never have been so widely

271
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,920
played if the pirate cart hadn't existed, and also just for the fact that the IGF is

272
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,920
bullshit.

273
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,640
It goes on to say, the fact that Fez can have already won an IGF award and now is nominated

274
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,360
for two other awards, including the grand prize, I think it's a really good reminder

275
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,360
that the IGF is all about cliqueyness, the scene-sters that I yell about, the fact that

276
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,440
it's about the established quote unquote indie scene.

277
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,760
Here is not only what we've been saying, but what many indie devs have been saying since

278
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,520
Gamergate began, straight from the mouth of Gamergate's opposition years ago.

279
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,440
Phil Fish himself even decides to step up to the plate.

280
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,000
He says that, after asking Brandon Boye about it, and being told the game had changed enough

281
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,880
to allow re-entry, he did so.

282
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,000
Fish describes the current IGF thusly.

283
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,520
The IGF wants the biggest, best games to enter.

284
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,440
They don't want the best developers to sit it out and be like, oh, we're too good and

285
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
this is the kids' table.

286
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,320
They really hate that kind of conception that the IGF is a scholarship.

287
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,420
It kind of used to be.

288
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,420
It got us started.

289
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,880
It got the attention of publishers and it got us the Microsoft deal, but that's just

290
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,880
a bonus.

291
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,160
So, what can we take away from this?

292
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,240
That the IGF doesn't want to be indie anymore?

293
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,740
I mean, it's certainly not a place for AAA developers, but it's pretty obvious what's

294
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,800
being said here.

295
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,400
There is now a divide between developing a game out of your basement indie and owning

296
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,640
your own game studio indie, and it's very clear which of the two groups make up the

297
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,280
judges, jurors, IGF staff, IGF winners, IGF finalists, and ultimately who the IGF wants

298
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
at the top.

299
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,880
We have consistently said that indie is just not indie anymore.

300
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,240
It's become its own institution and bureaucracy.

301
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,980
And Phil Fish, being interviewed by a fucking rock-paper-shotgun of all outlets, is confirming

302
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,560
everything we've been saying.

303
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:50,280
I honestly recommend you read the entire article, because there's just way too much both Phil

304
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,740
Fish and Anna Anthropy say to cover here.

305
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,000
But they parrot everything we've been saying for the past eight months about the IGF, with

306
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,200
Phil even going so far as to say, yeah, all my coworkers and friends are judges, and Brandon

307
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,160
Boy is my friend too, but it's totally not what it seems.

308
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
It's fucking surreal.

309
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,880
And as a cherry on top, check out Ed McMillan from Team Meat, and his wife Danielle chatting

310
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:38,240
about the whole thing while playing Binding

311
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:34,720
And then there's David Rosen of Humble Bundle fame, who is very anti-gamergate, sparing

312
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,760
no opportunity to call us all misogynists, dig into Total Biscuit, shill for Arthur Chu,

313
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,420
the whole nine yards.

314
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:46,360
And here he is in 2009, bringing up many of these issues with the IGF, issues that have

315
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,840
only grown since then.

316
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,000
Let's do a quick recap.

317
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,760
Jeb reveals that, back in 2010, judges vote on games, and those same judges then again

318
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
vote on the finalists to decide a winner.

319
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,440
In a post titled, Letter from the Chairman, explaining IGF's changes for 2011, the new

320
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,200
system of anonymous judges and specialist jurors is revealed.

321
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,400
Jeb also notes that he can only vote on the games he was given, when we know for a fact

322
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,080
that judges nowadays can vote on any game they like.

323
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,560
From 2006 to 2009, the internet wayback machine has a record of the IGF posting full public

324
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,560
judge lists.

325
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:23,560
This stops with IGF 2010, and going forward only public jury lists are posted, with their

326
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,520
reveals being treated almost like reality TV show twists by Gamasutra, the news outlet

327
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,080
owned by the IGF's parent company, UBM.

328
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,320
People who were vehemently anti-gamergate, both developers and journalists, were once

329
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,160
completely willing to criticize and investigate the IGF's conduct.

330
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,160
But now?

331
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,600
Not just radio silence from almost everybody, but directed attacks towards journalists and

332
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,920
developers who speak out against the IGF.

333
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,760
It's like a giant switch was flipped at around mid 2010 inside the IGF.

334
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,000
New judging systems were set in place, oversight was slowly dismantled, lists of contributors

335
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,560
were hidden away, and the people who should have been speaking out louder than ever all

336
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,200
suddenly shut up.

337
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,440
What the fuck happened?

338
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,060
Well, I'll tell you what happened.

339
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:11,600
One of the last public acts of Simon Carlos, the former chairman of the IGF, was to write

340
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,160
the ending paragraph of Jeb's post talking about how committed the IGF was to transparency,

341
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,000
back in January of 2010.

342
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,880
In May of that same year, our good friend Brandon Boye replaced Carlos as the IGF chairman,

343
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,140
and he has remained in that position to this day.

344
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,820
In Brandon's first, message from the chairman post, he ends it by saying, in the coming

345
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,140
weeks and months, I'll be laying out some of the ways that will be modifying and improving

346
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,020
the way the festival operates.

347
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,780
And the very next post on the site is a description of the new system that allows any judge to

348
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,340
vote for any game, and keeps judge lists private.

349
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,540
What the fuck happened?

350
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,460
Brandon Boye became chair.

351
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:56,220
Now in Alistair Pynsoff's interview on TechRaptor, he too has a lot to say about Brandon.

352
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:01,540
Pynsoff says, here's a guy who runs multiple award shows, runs sites that promotes indies,

353
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:07,140
is friends with devs, PR, all media types, and here he is on the Game Journal Pro's group.

354
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:12,080
To Brandon's credit, it does make sense that he was there, as he was a journalist before

355
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,020
becoming IGF chair.

356
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:18,180
But he was chairman after 2010, and leaked emails from the mailing list show that he

357
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:22,460
didn't leave, nor did he remain silent within the list after becoming chairman.

358
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,660
Pynsoff seems to share our opinion on Brandon.

359
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:29,500
He says, I think Boye is a good guy at heart, but money and power have a way of changing

360
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
things.

361
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:35,020
I'd like to see him and the IGF investigated and better governed in years to come so people

362
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:38,600
outside Boye's inner circle of investors are given a fair shake.

363
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,740
I wholeheartedly agree with this.

364
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,300
There's not enough evidence to say that Brandon Boye was the undisputed direct cause of all

365
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,740
the corruption in the IGF, but in my opinion, there is enough evidence to show a pattern

366
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,940
of changing rules and behaviours that seem to benefit Boye and his friends disproportionately.

367
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,620
I don't buy that it's a simple coincidence that after Boye arrives in the scene, rules

368
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:03,340
are changed that allow his friends' games to win finalist nominations and awards, all

369
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:08,420
the while the IGF's loudest critics suddenly go silent as one of their own, a fellow journalist,

370
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,620
ascends the throne.

371
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:13,420
Brandon Boye's ethically shaky actions seem to extend beyond the IGF as well.

372
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:17,780
In Alistair Pynsoff's interview, he mentions talking to Tiff Chow in 2011, who bragged

373
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,940
that her boyfriend, Steph Therrien, would win Fantastic Arcade's Best Game Award, another

374
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:26,400
award show that Brandon Boye runs, due to Steph and Brandon's friendship.

375
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,860
And sure enough, Steph's game won.

376
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:33,980
However, on a follow-up article on Kotaku, Tiff denies ever saying that, and Kotaku considered

377
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,980
the matter closed.

378
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,820
Well, that's some quality reporting work there, Totelo.

379
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:42,080
When you were earning your masters in journalism, which professor taught you that a he-said-she-said

380
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,460
scenario was proof enough for you to drop a subject?

381
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,700
Well don't worry about it, Steven, camera lady did the work for you.

382
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,080
Around the same time as Brandon was running the Fantastic Arcade's award show that Steph

383
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,000
would later win, he also wrote a number of articles on the website Offworld, promoting

384
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Steph's games.

385
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,160
Gamergate will know Offworld as the website Lea Alexander relocated her megaphone to after

386
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,080
she gracefully resigned from Gamasutra, of entirely her own accord, I'm sure.

387
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,080
A large number of social media posts show Brandon and Steph are friends as well, the

388
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:14,760
posts going far beyond normal industry chatter and discussing dinners, concerts, casual hanging

389
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,680
out, collaborating on projects, and explicit declarations of friendship.

390
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,600
And all of this stuff doesn't only apply to Brandon and Steph's friendship, either.

391
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,200
Just looking at Brandon's Offworld articles uncovers a massive amount of conflicts of

392
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,200
interest.

393
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,720
Here's one of his articles, 20 Games You Shouldn't Miss in 2014.

394
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,680
Of those 20, five games were made by individuals that can be proven to be Brandon's personal

395
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,680
friends.

396
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,880
Fjords by Kyle Reimergarten, HoHoCum by Honey Slug, which his friend Ricky Haggit works

397
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,720
for, How Do You Do It? by Nina Freeman, Pale Machine by Ben Esposito, and Sports Friends

398
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,520
by Dai Goot Fabric, which his friend Douglas Wilson works for.

399
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,880
Recommending their games isn't necessarily a conflict of interest, however recommending

400
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,560
their games and not disclosing friendships with the developers is.

401
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,720
And this really is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Brandon Boye.

402
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,960
Camera Lady cut her investigation of Brandon's time at Offworld short, mainly because this

403
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,600
video is already coming out late and she wanted me to record this as soon as possible.

404
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,840
But it seems like everything he sticks his fingers into becomes corrupt.

405
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:18,520
The IGF, Fantastic Arcade, his lack of disclosure in his writing, hell even in Indiecade Brandon

406
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
gives Steph an award.

407
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,520
We already know how much of a shitshow Indiecade is, add Brandon Boye to it and you might as

408
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,760
well burn the whole thing down, it's over.

409
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,000
Before I move on from Brandon I want to point out something that some people have noticed,

410
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,200
namely his funding campaign to fight his cancer, and how many people in the industry donated

411
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,200
to it.

412
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,760
We decided not to investigate this as a potential source of corruption for two reasons.

413
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,960
One, because if it were so, Brandon would have to use the money he received on something

414
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,000
other than cancer, and that is pretty much unprovable without either Brandon or a hospital

415
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,800
staff for leaking confidential records.

416
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,640
And two, because we're not heartless monsters.

417
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,460
Our investigations into Brandon Boye are regarding his professional conduct and seeing how some

418
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,320
personal relationships may negatively influence it.

419
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,560
We have nothing personally against him, and regardless of what he may or may not have

420
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,120
done, we hope he gets well.

421
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,120
Of course, while it seems like Brandon Boye is a massive red flag for the IGF and wider

422
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,200
industry all in his own, the IGF's issues don't stop with him.

423
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,920
Remember IndieFund?

424
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,320
We discussed their involvement in our bigger fish to fry video, but I'll give you a quick

425
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,920
rundown right now.

426
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,800
IndieFund is a group of people who band together to invest in indie game ideas that they think

427
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,120
show merit.

428
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,080
It sounds like a noble goal, until those same investors find themselves in positions of

429
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,560
power at various award shows and are therefore able to ensure a bigger kickback of profits

430
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,440
garnered from the increased sales that an award provides.

431
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,960
But it goes beyond Fez.

432
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,000
IndieFund Games seem to get a disproportionate number of IGF and IndieCade wins and nominations.

433
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,520
I'm sure the program's founders would claim that that's how it should be, that IndieFund

434
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,640
funds the best games, and that the award shows awards the best games.

435
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,600
So at the end of the day, it's simply quality bubbling to the surface.

436
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,400
But I don't think this is how it is.

437
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,180
When you look over the list of IndieFund-backed games, you begin to see some familiar indie

438
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,760
cabal names.

439
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,480
Here's Robin Arnott's game, no surprise he got funded.

440
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,760
Here's Framed, one of Zoe Quinn's games.

441
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,080
Oh, and here's a game by good ol' Steph Therrien, Brandon Boye's pal from earlier.

442
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,160
To an outsider like me, and I must assume to many smaller devs who are trying to get

443
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,120
started in the industry, IndieFund looks like a group of friends funding the games of other

444
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,860
friends while more friends give them awards, while the little people, the people who code

445
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,240
out of their living room, the people outside of the clique, the people who pay for a fair

446
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,360
shake at these contests and never get it, get the shaft.

447
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,840
And speaking of Framed, it won in the IGF twice.

448
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,680
Well holy shit, how'd that go down?

449
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:43,000
I mean, I thought after the gigantic shitstorm a few years ago, when Fez won in 2008 and

450
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,480
then entered into the IGF again in 2012, the rules were changed to prevent that.

451
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,880
Well no, Brandon Boye decided to make 2012 a transitional year, so the rules would be

452
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,640
fully changed in 2013, and Fez would be allowed to win a second time in 2012, but okay okay,

453
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,040
after that, no games winning twice.

454
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,600
Well shit Zoe, how'd you pull it off?

455
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:06,560
Oh I see, Framed won in IGF China, and then later in the main IGF.

456
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,760
Well that's a damn fine way to skirt the rules, and amongst IndieFund games, it's not just

457
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,920
Framed and Fez that were nominated as finalists or won in the IGF twice.

458
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:19,360
There was Antichamber, which was nominated in 2012, which also garnered a nomination

459
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,800
in 2011 under the name Hazard.

460
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,400
Is that all you have to do to get around the rules, just change your game's name?

461
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,920
To shift gears a bit, everyone remember Tim Schafer making an ass of himself at this year's

462
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,960
awards ceremony?

463
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,040
Did you know Tim Schafer, who is the physical spitting image of what all these antis say

464
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,780
the average gamer gator is?

465
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,840
It did feel pretty good that he mentioned us in a roundabout way, with this jab at our

466
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,680
video revealing the IGF's corruption.

467
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,880
He seems to think we're an indie dev in that joke though, but no, we're outsiders to the

468
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,880
industry.

469
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,280
And as outsiders to the industry, it seems to us like IndieFund exists to fund the projects

470
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,480
of Cabal members.

471
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,560
Matthew Wagner's the guy that comes up a few times in this video series.

472
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,740
Recall, he funded Fez, and later became one of the principal people behind IndieFund.

473
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,580
He also heads up his own studio, Flashbang Studios.

474
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,980
He's also a co-chair and regular judge and juror in the IGF.

475
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,040
As far as I know, Wagner doesn't work for Double Fine, Tim Schafer's studio, but for

476
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:14,660
some reason he does have access to Double Fine's Kickstarter financial data, which he

477
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,380
proudly showed off in February of 2012.

478
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,000
So at the very least, there's some type of undisclosed partnership or financial relationship

479
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,860
between Wagner and Double Fine.

480
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,580
Now, Tim Schafer's white guy accusing black guys of being white guys on the internet sock

481
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,460
puppet routine isn't the only dumb thing he's done.

482
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,360
Everybody and their grandma knows about Schafer taking Kickstarter funds and failing to deliver,

483
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,980
but as it turns out, quite a few Double Fine employees are also judges across multiple

484
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,980
years.

485
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,980
Considering that Matthew Wagner coded the IGF's judging software as an IGF judge and

486
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,460
juror repeatedly over the course of the festival's history, has a financial interest in seeing

487
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:54,380
all IndieFund games get as many awards and nominations as possible, and has some undisclosed

488
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,820
business and or financial link to Double Fine, is it no surprise to anybody that Double

489
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:03,120
Fine employees start showing up repeatedly on the juror lists, or that Tim Schafer waddled

490
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,100
on stage at the awards ceremony to make fun of people who dare question the actions of

491
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,340
him and his pals?

492
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,540
Let's keep going, what the fuck, I mean we're already this far in right?

493
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:15,260
Here's an indie game called Hundreds that proudly displays its three honorable mentions

494
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:20,640
in 2013's IGF, most notably Excellence in Visual Art, as well as its official selection

495
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,100
in IndieCade 2012.

496
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:29,060
Two of Hundreds devs are Adam Saltzman, AdamAtomic on Twitter, and Greg Wohlhand, A-E-I-O-W-U

497
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,060
on Twitter.

498
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:35,780
One of the IGF jurors in 2013, in the Excellence in Visual Art category, is Richard Hogg.

499
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,940
And wouldn't you know it, both Hogg and Wohlhand work for Saltzman's company, Finji, where

500
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,860
Saltzman mentions that one of the projects he's worked on is Fez, as well as Hogg having

501
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:49,800
worked on HoHoCome, a game that was nominated in the IGF while another of its devs was friends

502
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,040
with Brandon Boye.

503
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,380
And just to round this all into a neat little package, remember Maddy Brice?

504
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,480
Woman who outright said, downvoting all games with men in them as an IGF judge, and then

505
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:05,020
was shocked, SHOCKED, that she received enough backlash to it that the IGF removed her from

506
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,440
her position as judge?

507
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,540
And I do mean removed, rather than resigned in protest, despite what the IGF's apology

508
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,200
piece said at the end about her being welcome to return if she'd like.

509
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,120
Well, that apology piece was written by a person our anonymous indie dev says is named

510
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
Scavio.

511
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:27,200
Scavio refers to Megan Scavio, the GM of GDC, and our anonymous friend has quite a bit to

512
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
say about her.

513
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,360
Scavio did write the apology piece, which twisted around so absurdly that she said the

514
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,320
IGF's actions did nothing for Gamergate, when in reality, the IGF did the only thing

515
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,460
Gamergate wanted, which was to enforce objectivity.

516
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:46,280
The anonymous dev also says Scavio is a personal friend of Lea Alexander's, and she's been

517
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:51,600
attempting to exert further reach than the GDC's show manager allows, and that Scavio

518
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,600
was responsible for Tim Schafer's sock puppet joke.

519
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:59,820
Scavio has been trying to push into the volunteer program, and she's also known to give preference

520
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:04,880
to her friends for talks including those who are literally rehashing presentations from

521
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,220
other people applying, and that her qualifications are nebulous at best.

522
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:14,280
When asked to clarify, the anonymous dev said that Scavio would regularly threaten GDC's

523
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,720
conference associates with expulsion if they didn't tow the party line.

524
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,600
They also clarified that despite Scavio browbeating the conference associates, or CAs, the GDC

525
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,800
is run by them behind the scenes.

526
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,800
Well, what are conference associates?

527
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,680
Maybe the GDC's website can help.

528
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,960
So, your crowdfunding missed its target, you're a student with limited funds, your company

529
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,200
can't send you, or you just want to lend a hand.

530
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,480
Whatever the reason, you may still be able to attend this premiere event by becoming

531
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,960
a conference associate.

532
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,760
Are you willing to earn your attendance?

533
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,080
Oh, so that's what conference associates are.

534
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,120
Indie devs who are outside the clique.

535
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,300
This page reads like the propaganda pamphlet to a pyramid scheme.

536
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,800
The GDC relies on the labor of those outside of the indie cabal in order to function, and

537
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,200
hears Scavio coming down hard on them, telling them that they'd better not step out of line

538
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,280
if they want to have a future in game development.

539
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,800
What a surprise.

540
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,640
It sounds to me like Megan Scavio got hired on at the GDC not due to any sort of qualification,

541
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,960
but because of who she knew.

542
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,520
That she's been rejecting potential speakers at GDC only to turn around and give their

543
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,880
work to her friends to make panels out of instead, and that she's been trying to push

544
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,040
herself into managerial areas that her job title doesn't cover, presumably out of some

545
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,820
kind of authoritarian power trip.

546
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:27,680
I am under no illusion that what I'm about to suggest will solve all the IGF's problems

547
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,680
overnight.

548
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:34,560
But, before the next IGF opens its doors, Brandon Boye needs to step down from the position

549
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,560
of chairman.

550
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,600
The IGF rules need to be examined and changed appropriately.

551
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,720
The judging software of the IGF needs to be audited by a third party.

552
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,600
And given that the IGF operates out of California, the IGF needs to be compliant with state law

553
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,920
regarding contests and regulations for entrant fairness, which states that, misrepresenting

554
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,720
in any manner the odds of winning any prize is prohibited.

555
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,780
And if after an extensive review of the IGF by an outside party reveals this law to have

556
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:06,120
been broken, legal action must be taken against the parties involved.

557
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,960
And if you're an indie dev listening to this, yes, I'll repeat my now tired refrain of

558
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,380
please come forward and tell us what you've seen.

559
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:17,120
But also, if you're an indie dev not in the cool kids club, the indie gaming inner circle,

560
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,600
and you're considering entering your game into the next IGF, don't.

561
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,280
Do you know what your hundred dollar entry fee is doing?

562
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,600
It's keeping the Cabal up and running.

563
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,800
You're paying for their rent, and you're not even getting the one thing you bought

564
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,800
in return.

565
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,360
A fair shake at the prize.

566
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,360
And if you're hoping to get funding from Indie Fund, again, don't.

567
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,080
It seems like they won't take your game no matter how good it is because you're

568
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,240
not in the clique.

569
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,540
I don't know how else to say this, guys.

570
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,720
These people aren't looking out for your interests, they don't give a shit about

571
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,720
your games.

572
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,800
To them, you're nothing but a source of revenue.

573
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,960
Your entry fees keep them going, and they're banking on your hope and optimism pushing

574
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,200
you to come back against your better judgement.

575
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,700
Don't let them do it to you.

576
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:59,860
To end this off, Robert Yang was a first time IGF judge in 2014, and he wrote a blog post

577
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,200
about his experiences.

578
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,680
He talks about the IGF's strengths and weaknesses.

579
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,920
He encourages people to speak out against the IGF if they think they're doing a bad

580
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,920
job.

581
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,720
But most importantly, he talks about the IGF's alternatives.

582
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,720
He says,

583
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,560
The IGF used to be one of the most important things ever, the Academy Awards or Sundance

584
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,560
of games.

585
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,260
But it was always a strange idea that indie developers would fight to decentralize power

586
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,720
and then put all this prestige into this central institution.

587
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,420
Well, I'm pretty sure I know why.

588
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,920
Phil Fish said so himself back in the Rock Paper Shotgun article on the topic.

589
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,820
Back when the first waves of indies were new, they saw the injustices of the industry,

590
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,400
and they wanted a level playing field.

591
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,280
And once they got their level playing field, they promptly built a new industry right on

592
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,280
top of it.

593
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,060
A new bureaucratic structure to benefit them, while the generation of indies after them

594
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,860
is now stuck with looking at two giant corrupt systems instead of only one.

595
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,120
We saw it happen with Occupy, we saw it happen with Project Chanology, hell, we even saw

596
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,160
it happen with the fucking 18th century French intellectual movement.

597
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,040
Social misfits acting in the name of equality will unite under their shared experience of

598
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,560
misfithood, and then emulate the power structures of those that declared them misfits in the

599
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,400
first place, solely to wield authority over the next generation of misfits that comes

600
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
along.

601
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,400
Yang goes on to say that one of the IGF's benefits, a steam deal, is becoming less exclusive

602
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,360
over time, and that the attention the IGF garners is beginning to be usurped by the

603
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,000
sheer audience and reach of the popular YouTubers.

604
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And I have to agree with him.

605
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,560
If you're a small indie dev, and you're looking over the content of this video, and

606
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,640
you're just completely dismayed at the giant brick wall you see in front of you, don't

607
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,640
lose hope.

608
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,920
Don't pay a hundred bucks to enter your game into a rigged award show you'll never

609
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,920
win.

610
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,160
Send a review copy of your game off to Total Biscuit, or Angry Joe, or whoever else instead.

611
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,880
Don't support the old corrupt structures when your own customers are providing you

612
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,200
with viable alternatives.

613
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,100
Alistair Pintsov even said in his interview that journalists first rejected YouTubers

614
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,680
who reached out to them, then began to attack them as their popularity grew, and now are

615
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,040
desperately trying to emulate them as their old media methods crumble.

616
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,040
You don't need them.

617
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,040
A vocal anti-gamergate individual, Jen Frank of all people, wrote a reply on Unwinnable

618
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,800
to the allegations of IGF corruption, basically saying, I was an awesome IGF judge, and everything

619
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,040
was awesome, and the only reason I didn't play a game was because it was broken and

620
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
wouldn't install.

621
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,040
Hello.

622
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,040
Goodbye.

623
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,380
Camera Lady, along with a different anonymous indie dev than the one we've consistently

624
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:14,680
mentioned in this video, looked into the game Jen Klein was broken, and wouldn't install.

625
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,600
It became clear to both of them that she didn't actually play the game because the game was

626
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,160
on iOS.

627
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,840
A plug and play platform that requires no install process.

628
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:29,840
Anonymous Dev 2 also says, right after this incident, the IGF dropped TestFlight, an application

629
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,680
that monitored how long the judges actually played the games.

630
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,360
I guess they didn't want to see how little the IGF judges actually gave a shit.

631
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,400
But this wasn't why I brought up Jen Frank or her laughable article.

632
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,240
I bring it up because of what she says here.

633
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,640
If you think IGF judging doesn't work, find me a better system and I will lay off.

634
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
I'll just go.

635
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,160
In fact, I'll never write about video games again.

636
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,440
And a bit later, if you honestly feel that your flame is trapped in a vacuum, move on.

637
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,440
Just go.

638
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,080
There are other communities that will accept you.

639
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,360
Create your own system.

640
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,440
Make your own clubhouse.

641
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,520
I dare you.

642
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,840
The absolute arrogance here is astounding.

643
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,480
She sounds like an abusive lover.

644
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,640
Hey indies, I dare you to leave us.

645
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,700
I dare you.

646
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,700
You need us.

647
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,700
You'll never go.

648
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,280
Well, indie devs, it's time for you to call that bluff.

649
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,720
The IGF doesn't care about you.

650
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,240
It cares about Brandon Boyer's friends, and Tim Schafer's friends, and Matthew Wagner's

651
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,280
friends, and Phil Fish's friends.

652
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,800
It doesn't care about indies.

653
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,820
It cares about people who were indies 10 years ago and have now become part of the establishment

654
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,960
while not wanting to take off the indie hat.

655
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,400
You are nothing to them.

656
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,200
They're daring you to leave, thinking they'll never do it.

657
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,480
Those losers need us.

658
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,480
We have the power.

659
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,040
But there is a new clubhouse.

660
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,240
We're offering it to you, right here and now.

661
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,140
Turn away from these sycophants and never look back.

662
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:45,360
And hey, Jen Frank, when the indie devs get fed up with your inflammatory bullshit and

663
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,140
leave you and your clique of corrupt friends high and dry, I expect you to hold up your

664
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,960
end of the bargain and never write about video games again.

665
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:57,520
We'll all be better off for it.

666
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,520
That's all for today, guys.

667
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,120
It wasn't just camera lady sleuthing in my reading that brought this video together.

668
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,120
A lot of us worked on it.

669
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,900
Special thanks to Derek Smart for willing to discuss issues rather than simply mudslinging.

670
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,420
As well as to our two anonymous indie devs, who asked to remain anonymous because they

671
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:13,400
legitimately fear for their jobs and careers by speaking out against the IGF and all these

672
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
individuals.

673
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,080
Special thanks to William Usher, who helped providing us with some contacts, and Thryden,

674
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:23,340
Stealth Suit, Krios, and somebody only by the name of Temporary Account 2 for providing

675
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,880
some of the information and leads.

676
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,120
And a very special thanks to three people who actually gave us money to keep this show

677
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,120
going.

678
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,220
Pasquale Festa, Hente Logic, and the late and great King of Pole.

679
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,920
At this point, I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about something else.

680
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,480
It's only slightly related to Gamergate, so if you want to check out now, that's completely

681
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,480
fine.

682
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,480
Feel free to do so.

683
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,420
There's no hard feelings from myself or camera at all.

684
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,120
I'm sure this video's gone on long enough as it is.

685
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,400
Camera Lady recently had a conversation over on the Let's Play subreddit.

686
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,380
As I'm sure you know, we also post Let's Plays, anime reviews, and other stuff on this channel,

687
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,820
along with these indefensible videos.

688
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,620
Somebody with 20,000 subscribers and 3 million views started a thread about how to grow your

689
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,380
channel, so camera asked some questions about it looking how to grow our short pet otaku

690
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:07,860
channel here, and was promptly tore into for supporting Gamergate, accusing us of simply

691
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:12,460
using Gamergate and not contributing to it, shilling on the hashtag, being misogynist,

692
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,460
and so on.

693
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,980
We always wanted to do a video, or at least talk at the end of a Gamergate video, introducing

694
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:21,260
us and our other content to our new Gamergate subscribers.

695
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,940
But this conversation made us think long and hard about what we should be saying.

696
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:28,340
We don't want to appear as shills, we don't want to appear like we're just using Gamergate

697
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,780
for attention.

698
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,940
If we were, I don't think we'd be doing this much investigative work in these videos that

699
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,940
we make.

700
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:39,740
But at the same time, we do want to promote ourselves, to promote our other types of videos,

701
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,140
and generally just to grow as a channel.

702
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,140
It's no secret that we take money and gifts from people willing to give them to us.

703
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,740
I want to take a minute here and outline exactly what we do with what we get, and why it's

704
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,980
relevant to our Gamergate video series, not just our other stuff.

705
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,260
To start off, yes we have a Patreon.

706
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:57,820
It's at, predictably, patreon.com slash short pet otaku.

707
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:01,580
For anybody interested in giving not on a monthly basis, but only once, we also have

708
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:05,540
a paypal account under the email shortpetotaku at hotmail.com.

709
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:09,380
And we have publicly posted our address for physical gifts, but I don't think I'm going

710
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,180
to provide that in a Gamergate video.

711
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:14,380
Now in the interest of transparency, I'm going to provide you with a list of rules we've

712
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,740
set for ourselves regarding the money that we get from you, mainly because we're from

713
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:21,900
the old guard of the internet that always saw money making on the internet as sketchy,

714
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,820
and social media not being anonymous as a massive mistake.

715
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:29,280
Rule one, we don't want anybody to feel pressured to give us anything, ever.

716
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,080
If you want to give us anything, or can't afford to give us anything, it will never

717
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,880
ever be held against you.

718
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,640
If you want to run ad blockers in our videos, same deal.

719
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,520
I don't ever want anybody to feel excluded from our channel, our content, or any kind

720
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,100
of community going around us because they can't or won't give money.

721
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,100
Everybody is welcome here.

722
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:49,520
Rule two, we have patreon set to monthly because we're actually a daily upload channel, and

723
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,620
setting it to per video is a bit ridiculous.

724
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:56,600
This isn't like so many journalists or developers or mid-tier e-celebs out there who simply

725
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,980
set it to monthly, do next to nothing, and rake in the dough.

726
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,800
We are always posting something.

727
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:08,040
Rule three, 100% of any money you give us, on patreon, or paypal, or through ad revenue,

728
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,520
will be used on our channel.

729
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,520
Period.

730
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,520
No exceptions.

731
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,760
We don't intend to live off of your generosity.

732
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:17,320
We have a wish list of sound equipment, lighting equipment, camera equipment, and games and

733
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,600
anime we like to do videos on.

734
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,800
You will not see us rake in 13k a month and then brag about getting a new motorcycle on

735
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,800
twitter.

736
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,800
Like some people.

737
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,680
As a sub rule, whenever we're given a physical gift, like a game or anime, we'll guarantee

738
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,680
you'll get videos on it.

739
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,640
The Bible Black DVD set was given to us as a gift from a fan, and we made six riff videos

740
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,680
out of it so far.

741
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,340
If you are generous enough to give to us, we feel it is our responsibility to give back

742
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,820
to you in kind.

743
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:46,640
Rule four, we will post the receipts of any purchase made with your money on the short

744
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,960
Fedotaku twitter account.

745
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,040
As an example, we spent $90 on an SNES flashcard using YouTube ad revenue, and Dave put up

746
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,880
a picture of the receipt on twitter.

747
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,000
We intend to use the cart to revive a series called Game Roulette, the first two seasons

748
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,660
of which can be found on our channel.

749
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:05,400
Over the years we have also purchased an AT2020 microphone, an Elgato, a Dazzle, and several

750
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,440
older consoles using BlipTV ad revenue.

751
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,440
You will always know what we're doing with your money and which purchases contribute

752
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,840
to which of our projects.

753
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:20,400
Rule five, yes, this stuff will also help Indefensible as a series grow, not just our

754
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,840
let's plays and reviews.

755
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,720
Hamerlady estimates $300 to update our audio equipment, which we intend to use to improve

756
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,160
our gamergate video's audio quality as well as our other projects.

757
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,600
The editing PC and potentially even the new camera will also expand what we can do for

758
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,600
Indefensible.

759
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,060
It's true that your money will be going towards our other projects, but it will simultaneously

760
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,440
also be going towards new gamergate videos.

761
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,080
If you're interested in giving, but you're on the fence because you only watch us for

762
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:49,160
gamergate, don't worry, your money will go towards gamergate.

763
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:53,280
Rule six, this bears saying a second time, nobody has to give.

764
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,040
The truth of it is, if we got exactly zero dollars from anybody, we would still upload

765
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,040
daily.

766
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,200
The let's plays would still come.

767
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,880
The anime reviews would still be coming.

768
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,520
We'd still try to put out Indefensible once a week, though I don't know how successful

769
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,520
we'd be.

770
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,740
If you're somebody who just does not give a shit about our channel outside of gamergate

771
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:13,720
and does not care to give us anything to improve our gamergate videos, that's still fine with

772
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,720
us.

773
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,720
You'll always be welcome here.

774
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,200
We never want to become that asshole who shits on his viewerbase for not doing enough

775
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,200
or whatever.

776
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,320
We leave the option to give it to us open to you if you like our content and feel inclined

777
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,440
to do so, and we will never look down on somebody who doesn't.

778
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,120
The way I see it is the internet has a lot of huge gaping money pits.

779
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,180
Some of them are good causes, a lot of them aren't.

780
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,320
If you decide to throw some into ours, I can promise you that we'll be grateful and that

781
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,120
we'll put your money to good use investing in our channel, and if that doesn't appeal

782
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,240
to you, that's okay too.

783
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,280
Please stay and enjoy whatever videos you want.

784
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,280
Well, that's my pitch.

785
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,120
I don't know how strong it is, but there it is.

786
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:48,040
If you're interested, the paypal email is shortpilotaka.com and the Patreon is under

787
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,040
shortpilotaka.

788
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,320
And if you're not, thanks for listening this far anyway.

789
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:55,040
We hope to get up another indefensible video in about a week and a half's time, camera

790
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,560
lady sleuthing dug up several more topics of interest that weren't related to the IGF,

791
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,000
so it's going to be a whole lot of fun in the coming weeks.

792
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,920
And if you want to see me and Dave sooner, come check out our other stuff.

793
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:05,640
We upload daily.
