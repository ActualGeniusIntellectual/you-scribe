00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Hey guys, a quick announcement before I begin the video. A lot of people have asked me for

00:04.000 --> 00:08.800
other options to financially support the channel. I guess because they don't want to give YouTube or

00:08.800 --> 00:12.880
Twitch a cut of the Super Chat or of the Twitch sub. So I've gone ahead and set up a few other

00:12.880 --> 00:17.840
options. If you check out the description of videos on my SFO channel or of the Game Boomers

00:17.840 --> 00:21.680
stream VODs over on the Game Boomer channel, you'll see something like this now. I've decided

00:21.680 --> 00:26.000
to update all the links. And yes, you can always still sub at Twitch. You can always give it

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
subscribestar, Patreon, or PayPal. I put a Streamlabs link in there as well because

00:30.560 --> 00:34.800
people really wanted me to get Streamlabs, so there it is. One guy asked for cash app,

00:34.800 --> 00:38.640
and I didn't do that, I guess because I'm too much of a boomer to figure it out. I tried.

00:38.640 --> 00:41.840
There's a few other options down here that I can talk about as well. This is my Amazon affiliate

00:41.840 --> 00:46.720
link. If you click this, anything that you buy after you click that link in that window

00:46.720 --> 00:51.520
should give me, I think, a 5% cut. The price that you pay for goods on Amazon won't go up.

00:51.520 --> 00:54.880
Amazon will just give me a little bit of money. Some people for some reason have also wanted to

00:54.880 --> 01:01.920
outright buy me stuff for the show, so I made a public Amazon Canada and Amazon US wish list.

01:01.920 --> 01:06.080
Now, the items on this list are actually pretty expensive because it's all show equipment,

01:06.080 --> 01:11.200
and I do not expect anyone to buy anything on this list, okay? A few people asked in DMs like,

01:11.200 --> 01:14.880
hey, I want to buy you some equipment. And I'm like, dude, equipment's expensive to run shows

01:14.880 --> 01:20.720
like this. But they insisted, so I made a list of all the things that I don't necessarily need

01:20.720 --> 01:24.080
immediately because if it's an immediate need, I just buy it myself. But stuff that could really

01:24.080 --> 01:27.760
help the show's quality if I were to get it. So everything on these lists, it's either products

01:27.760 --> 01:33.920
that I want to use on Game Boomers or review on the dev kit or sometimes both. It's show equipment,

01:33.920 --> 01:37.680
computer equipment, stuff that I can use to increase the quality of all my shows. So there's

01:37.680 --> 01:41.040
computer equipment on there. There's some specialized equipment on there. I didn't put

01:41.040 --> 01:45.840
games on there, like games that I would like to stream on Game Boomers because that's a bit too

01:45.840 --> 01:51.040
celery, I think, in my opinion. I don't want to just ask people for games. But stuff that I know

01:51.040 --> 01:55.120
that I will use to make the show better, I put on the list. And finally, there's also a Humble

01:55.120 --> 01:59.120
Bundle affiliate link there because I've been a Humble Bundle partner for a while. When you click

01:59.120 --> 02:02.400
on that link, you get something like this. Thank you for supporting Short Fire Otaku. And then

02:02.960 --> 02:08.080
basically anything that you buy on the website in this window, you can choose to give me a cut of

02:08.080 --> 02:11.520
it. So let's say you wanted to buy, actually, there's no really good bundles right now,

02:11.520 --> 02:16.400
is there? Let's say double fine. Why not? You're going to go, you're going to get the bundle. Okay.

02:16.400 --> 02:19.200
What you can do is you can go to here. It says choose where your money goes.

02:20.080 --> 02:24.400
There's publishers, charities, a tip to Humble Bundle, and also me. And you can actually adjust

02:24.400 --> 02:31.360
these sliders to give me as much or as little of the cut or anybody else of the cut as you like.

02:31.360 --> 02:35.680
So if you do buy games through Humble Bundle, that is a great way to also support the channel.

02:35.680 --> 02:38.880
And all those links will be in the description of all the videos going forward. And I also want

02:38.880 --> 02:44.000
to make it absolutely clear that there is no obligation to ever do any of this. No one has

02:44.000 --> 02:49.040
to buy me stuff. No one has to donate money. No one has to do anything. If you just want to

02:49.040 --> 02:53.200
watch the videos and enjoy them, I am very happy and very thankful that you're here.

02:53.200 --> 02:58.400
I put these options up, not because I demand everyone simp for me or something,

02:58.400 --> 03:03.840
but simply because people have been asking for them. And to be honest, I could use the help. So

03:03.840 --> 03:07.600
if you want to financially support the channel, there are many ways to do so now. And if you just

03:07.600 --> 03:10.640
want to hang out, well, then I am happy to have you here. Now that that's out of the way, let's

03:10.640 --> 03:17.920
talk about Kamala Harris guys, because she was the VP pick for Joe Biden. I know everyone wanted

03:17.920 --> 03:21.440
the Bernie Biden ticket because that was kind of unrealistic though. People really thought it was

03:21.440 --> 03:26.400
going to be the Biden Hillary ticket. That would have immediately torpedoed any chances of him

03:26.400 --> 03:31.760
winning. But to be honest, with the way that the radical left is writing about police right now,

03:31.760 --> 03:35.760
choosing Kamala Harris has basically done that as well. Let's quickly go over Kamala Harris's

03:35.760 --> 03:41.360
record. In 2014, the LA Times published the article, federal judges order California to

03:41.360 --> 03:47.120
expand prison releases. Federal judges on Friday ordered California to launch a new parole program

03:47.120 --> 03:52.400
that could free more prisoners early, ruling the state had failed to fully implement an order last

03:52.400 --> 03:57.680
February intended to reduce unconstitutional crowding. The judges for a second time ordered

03:57.680 --> 04:02.880
that all non-violent second strike offenders be eligible for parole after serving half of

04:02.880 --> 04:07.760
their sentence. They told corrections officials to submit new plans for that parole process by

04:07.760 --> 04:13.840
December 1st. Most of those prisoners work as groundskeepers, janitors, and in prison kitchens,

04:13.840 --> 04:20.560
with wages that range from 8 cents to 37 cents per hour. Lawyers for the attorney general Kamala

04:20.560 --> 04:26.400
Harris have argued in court that if forced to release these inmates, prisons would lose an

04:26.400 --> 04:32.480
important labor pool. I guess keeping non-violent criminals in prison even though they're eligible

04:32.480 --> 04:37.840
for parole in order to make them work in the old sweatshops is a priority for Kamala Harris.

04:37.840 --> 04:44.240
In 2010, the Guardian reported that Kamala Harris was behind a major push in San Francisco

04:44.800 --> 04:48.400
to lock up parents if their children skipped school.

04:48.400 --> 04:53.600
So I decided I was going to start prosecuting parents for truancy.

04:53.600 --> 04:58.400
Well, this was a little controversial in San Francisco.

05:01.200 --> 05:05.600
And frankly, my staff went bananas. They were very concerned because we didn't know at the

05:05.600 --> 05:10.240
time whether I was going to have an opponent in my reelection race. But I said, look, I'm done.

05:10.880 --> 05:14.960
This is a serious issue, and I've got a little political capital, and I'm going to spend some

05:14.960 --> 05:24.240
of it. And this is what we did. We recognized that in that initiative, as a prosecutor in law

05:24.240 --> 05:28.560
enforcement, I have a huge stick. The school district has got a carrot.

05:28.560 --> 05:33.040
This article, published in the New York Times, titled Kamala Harris was not a progressive

05:33.040 --> 05:38.160
prosecutor, outlines a number of significant events. Time after time, when progressives

05:38.160 --> 05:43.120
urged her to embrace criminal justice reforms as a district attorney and then the state's

05:43.120 --> 05:48.720
attorney general, Ms. Harris opposed them or stayed silent. Most troubling, Ms. Harris

05:48.720 --> 05:53.200
fought tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through

05:53.200 --> 05:58.480
official misconduct that included evidence tampering, false testimony, and the suppression

05:58.480 --> 06:02.640
of crucial information by prosecutors. Consider her record as San Francisco's

06:02.640 --> 06:08.720
district attorney from 2004 to 2011. Ms. Harris was criticized in 2010 for withholding information

06:08.720 --> 06:13.920
about a police laboratory technician who had been accused of intentionally sabotaging her work

06:13.920 --> 06:18.240
and stealing drugs from the lab. After a memo surfaced that Ms. Harris' deputies knew about

06:18.240 --> 06:23.200
the technician's wrongdoing and recent conviction but failed to alert defense lawyers, a judge

06:23.200 --> 06:28.240
condemned Ms. Harris' indifference to the systemic violation of the defendant's constitutional rights.

06:28.240 --> 06:34.880
Ms. Harris lost that case, and more than 600 cases handled by the corrupt technician were dismissed.

06:34.880 --> 06:39.040
How many of those 600 were actually guilty and are now roaming the streets because of

06:39.040 --> 06:42.720
the corruption of Kamala Harris? She also championed state legislation under

06:42.720 --> 06:45.680
which parents whose children were found to be habitually truant in elementary school

06:45.680 --> 06:49.440
could be prosecuted despite concerns that would disproportionately affect low-income

06:49.440 --> 06:55.920
people of color. In 2014, she declined to take a position on Proposition 47,

06:55.920 --> 07:01.600
a ballot initiative approved by voters that reduced certain low-level felonies to misdemeanors.

07:01.600 --> 07:05.520
She laughed that year when a reporter asked if she would support the legalization of marijuana

07:05.520 --> 07:10.800
for recreational use. In 2015, she opposed a bill requiring her office to investigate shootings

07:10.800 --> 07:16.000
involving officers, and she refused to support statewide standards regulating the use of body-worn

07:16.000 --> 07:20.800
cameras by police officers. Worst of all is her record in wrongful conviction cases,

07:20.800 --> 07:25.440
considered George Gage, an electrician with no criminal record who was charged in 1999

07:25.440 --> 07:29.440
with sexually abusing his stepdaughter, who reported the allegations years later.

07:29.440 --> 07:33.680
Afterward, the judge discovered that the prosecutor had unlawfully held back potentially

07:33.680 --> 07:38.080
exculpatory evidence, including medical reports indicating that the stepdaughter had been

07:38.080 --> 07:42.560
repeatedly untruthful with law enforcement. Her mother even described her as a pathological liar.

07:42.560 --> 07:46.480
In 2015, when the case reached the United States Court of Appeals,

07:46.480 --> 07:51.440
Ms. Harris' prosecutors defended the conviction. They pointed out that Mr. Gage, while forced to

07:51.440 --> 07:56.480
act as his own lawyer, had not properly raised the legal issue in the lower court.

07:56.480 --> 07:59.760
The judges acknowledged this impediment and sent the case to mediation,

07:59.760 --> 08:04.720
a clear signal for Ms. Harris to dismiss the case. When she refused to budge, the court upheld the

08:04.720 --> 08:09.840
conviction on that technicality. Mr. Gage is still in prison serving a 70-year sentence. This case

08:09.840 --> 08:15.920
is not an outlier. Ms. Harris also fought to keep Daniel Larson in prison on a 28-year-to-life

08:15.920 --> 08:20.560
sentence for his possession of a concealed weapon even though his trial lawyer was incompetent

08:20.560 --> 08:24.720
and there was compelling evidence of his innocence. Relying on a technicality again,

08:24.720 --> 08:29.440
Ms. Harris argued that Mr. Larson failed to raise his legal arguments in a timely fashion.

08:29.440 --> 08:33.680
This time, she lost. She defended Johnny Baca's conviction for murder even though

08:33.680 --> 08:38.240
judges found that a prosecutor presented false testimony at the trial. She relented only after

08:38.240 --> 08:42.480
a video of the oral argument received national attention and embarrassed her office. And then

08:42.480 --> 08:47.280
there's Kevin Cooper, the death row inmate whose trial was infected by racism and corruption.

08:47.280 --> 08:51.680
He sought advanced DNA testing to prove his innocence, but Ms. Harris opposed it.

08:51.680 --> 08:55.760
After the New York Times' expose of the case went viral, she reversed her position.

08:55.760 --> 09:01.680
In Kamala Harris' memoir, she writes that America has a deep and dark history of people using the

09:01.680 --> 09:06.240
power of the prosecutor as an instrument of injustice. I know this history well,

09:06.240 --> 09:10.640
of innocent men framed, of charges brought against people without sufficient evidence,

09:10.640 --> 09:13.680
of prosecutors hiding information that would exonerate defendants,

09:13.680 --> 09:19.120
of the disproportionate application of the law. All too often, she was on the wrong side of that

09:19.120 --> 09:24.080
history. And of course, Vice had no problem reporting on this back on October 10th, 2019.

09:49.120 --> 10:07.040
In this article from the Monterey Herald,

10:07.040 --> 10:12.240
an article now only available on the Internet Wayback Machine, Kamala Harris backs asset

10:12.240 --> 10:16.960
seizure before criminal charges. Civil asset forfeiture allows police to seize money and

10:16.960 --> 10:21.920
property under a simple suspicion of that money and property being used for criminal activity,

10:21.920 --> 10:26.720
even if there are no criminal charges. This law has allowed the police to steal from innocent

10:26.720 --> 10:31.440
people, and entire PD budgets have been funded with deceased property. Even though the law is

10:31.440 --> 10:36.880
very unpopular and arguably unconstitutional, Kamala Harris has made a career of publicly

10:36.880 --> 10:41.920
supporting it. She sponsored a bill to allow a seizure of profits without charges, and as this

10:41.920 --> 10:46.560
article states, in 2011 she opposed a bill that would have reformed the procedure. Thankfully,

10:46.560 --> 10:51.760
there was at least one person on one of the Democratic debate stages willing to

10:51.760 --> 10:54.960
stand up to Kamala Harris and tell her exactly what she was to her face.

11:16.560 --> 11:21.920
would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so.

11:21.920 --> 11:26.640
She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of

11:26.640 --> 11:33.280
California. And she fought to keep cash bail system in place that impacts poor people in

11:33.280 --> 11:39.680
the worst kind of way. Oh, Tulsi, you're too good for the DNC. But all this criticism is just racist.

11:39.680 --> 11:44.880
It's just racist. She's female. She's black. She's an Asian American. That's all you need to know,

11:44.880 --> 11:51.040
right? I mean, her dad's Jamaican. Her mom's from India. I always thought, you know,

11:51.040 --> 11:55.440
Indian and Asian as being two separate things, even though they are both technically from the

11:55.440 --> 12:00.480
continent of Asia. But I guess she's Asian American in the same way that someone from

12:00.480 --> 12:04.800
India is Asian American. Okay, fine. Her dad's Jamaican, and there's probably at least a little

12:04.800 --> 12:11.120
bit of black ancestry there because a lot of Jamaicans are a mixture of native Jamaicans and

12:11.200 --> 12:18.160
African slaves brought over. So I guess she's kind of black. I guess being dark skinned is

12:18.160 --> 12:24.000
enough to qualify for dem reparations. Unless, of course, you're family owned slaves, Kamala.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.360
Kamala Harris's father drops another big bombshell about her family history. Forget marijuana. This

12:29.360 --> 12:34.080
is big. My roots go back within my lifetime to my paternal grandmother, Miss Krishi,

12:34.080 --> 12:38.560
a descendant of Hamilton Brown, who was on record as a plantation and slave owner

12:38.560 --> 12:44.240
and the founder of Brownstown. Interestingly enough, Senator Harris favors paying reparation

12:44.240 --> 12:49.200
to American blacks who have been impacted by slavery and discrimination. Well, how much are

12:49.200 --> 12:54.240
you going to have to pay out Kamala? Like, I think that the whole reparation stuff is nonsense. But

12:54.240 --> 12:59.680
if that is the rule book that the left insists on playing by, Kamala's got to pay up. I have the

12:59.680 --> 13:04.480
great honor to announce that I've picked Kamala Harris, a fearless fighter for the little guy,

13:04.480 --> 13:09.040
and one of the country's finest public servants as my running mate. Oh, really,

13:09.040 --> 13:13.520
Joe? Are you sure about that? What about that time when she called you a racist to your face?

13:34.480 --> 14:01.120
What about that time when she said that she believes those people who accused you of sexual

14:01.120 --> 14:06.320
assault? Hell, what about that time when she appeared on TV looking like a space alien?

14:06.320 --> 14:10.720
Holy shit, Kamala, you're supposed to let the Botox settle in a little bit before you start

14:10.720 --> 14:15.680
doing stuff. Damn, maybe there actually are reptilian shapeshifters. But now that Kamala

14:15.680 --> 14:21.040
has been ordained, everyone's being told to get in line. Even Bernie, who immediately did so,

14:21.040 --> 14:25.520
obviously. You know, I was actually a Bernie bro back in 2016. The minute that I saw him

14:25.520 --> 14:29.360
cuck out to Hillary, hell, the minute that I saw him cuck out to those Black Lives Matter

14:29.360 --> 14:33.680
activists who stormed the stage. That was when I basically realized the man doesn't have a spine.

14:33.680 --> 14:39.120
And here he is telling the communist left to shut the fuck up and get in line. The progressives have

14:39.120 --> 14:43.600
always been a useful tool to the Democrats. And of course, we all know that a vote for Joe Biden

14:43.600 --> 14:48.400
is a vote for Kamala Harris. Even Biden knows it. I've decided that Kamala Harris is the best person

14:48.400 --> 14:52.960
to help me take this fight to Donald Trump and Mike Pence, and then to lead this nation starting

14:52.960 --> 14:59.040
in January 2021. Biden, you're supposed to be leading. Biden. It's not supposed to be here.

14:59.040 --> 15:03.280
It's not supposed to be here. It's supposed to be you. Joe Biden made the pick that maximized his

15:03.280 --> 15:08.000
chances of continuing to make the race a straight referendum on Trump while also selecting somebody

15:08.000 --> 15:14.240
whose resume suggests being ready to step in if and when Biden decides to step aside. The media's

15:14.240 --> 15:18.480
role in this is to prepare the people for a Kamala Harris presidency. They're already starting the

15:18.480 --> 15:22.240
preconditioning to get you to accept it when it happens. Listen, I know, I know Trump's not

15:22.240 --> 15:26.720
perfect. I have disagreed with him a fair amount myself, but if I were an American, I'd be voting

15:26.720 --> 15:32.080
Trump. This is an absolute shit show. Kamala Harris is a disgrace. Joe Biden's a disgrace.

15:32.080 --> 15:36.640
They both have long standing tough on crime records. And they're currently trying to court

15:36.640 --> 15:40.880
a crowd of people who think that all cops are bastards and want the complete defunding and

15:40.880 --> 15:45.040
abolition of the police. This is not going to go well for them. And I'm pretty sure that with this

15:45.040 --> 15:47.600
pick, Trump has got 2020 in the bag.
