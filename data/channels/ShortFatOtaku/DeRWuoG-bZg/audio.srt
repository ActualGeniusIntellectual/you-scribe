1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hey guys, a quick announcement before I begin the video. A lot of people have asked me for

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,800
other options to financially support the channel. I guess because they don't want to give YouTube or

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,880
Twitch a cut of the Super Chat or of the Twitch sub. So I've gone ahead and set up a few other

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,840
options. If you check out the description of videos on my SFO channel or of the Game Boomers

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,680
stream VODs over on the Game Boomer channel, you'll see something like this now. I've decided

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,000
to update all the links. And yes, you can always still sub at Twitch. You can always give it

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
subscribestar, Patreon, or PayPal. I put a Streamlabs link in there as well because

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,800
people really wanted me to get Streamlabs, so there it is. One guy asked for cash app,

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,640
and I didn't do that, I guess because I'm too much of a boomer to figure it out. I tried.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,840
There's a few other options down here that I can talk about as well. This is my Amazon affiliate

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,720
link. If you click this, anything that you buy after you click that link in that window

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,520
should give me, I think, a 5% cut. The price that you pay for goods on Amazon won't go up.

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,880
Amazon will just give me a little bit of money. Some people for some reason have also wanted to

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,920
outright buy me stuff for the show, so I made a public Amazon Canada and Amazon US wish list.

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,080
Now, the items on this list are actually pretty expensive because it's all show equipment,

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,200
and I do not expect anyone to buy anything on this list, okay? A few people asked in DMs like,

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,880
hey, I want to buy you some equipment. And I'm like, dude, equipment's expensive to run shows

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,720
like this. But they insisted, so I made a list of all the things that I don't necessarily need

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,080
immediately because if it's an immediate need, I just buy it myself. But stuff that could really

20
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,760
help the show's quality if I were to get it. So everything on these lists, it's either products

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,920
that I want to use on Game Boomers or review on the dev kit or sometimes both. It's show equipment,

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,680
computer equipment, stuff that I can use to increase the quality of all my shows. So there's

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,040
computer equipment on there. There's some specialized equipment on there. I didn't put

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,840
games on there, like games that I would like to stream on Game Boomers because that's a bit too

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,040
celery, I think, in my opinion. I don't want to just ask people for games. But stuff that I know

26
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,120
that I will use to make the show better, I put on the list. And finally, there's also a Humble

27
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,120
Bundle affiliate link there because I've been a Humble Bundle partner for a while. When you click

28
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,400
on that link, you get something like this. Thank you for supporting Short Fire Otaku. And then

29
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,080
basically anything that you buy on the website in this window, you can choose to give me a cut of

30
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,520
it. So let's say you wanted to buy, actually, there's no really good bundles right now,

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,400
is there? Let's say double fine. Why not? You're going to go, you're going to get the bundle. Okay.

32
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,200
What you can do is you can go to here. It says choose where your money goes.

33
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,400
There's publishers, charities, a tip to Humble Bundle, and also me. And you can actually adjust

34
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,360
these sliders to give me as much or as little of the cut or anybody else of the cut as you like.

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,680
So if you do buy games through Humble Bundle, that is a great way to also support the channel.

36
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,880
And all those links will be in the description of all the videos going forward. And I also want

37
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,000
to make it absolutely clear that there is no obligation to ever do any of this. No one has

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,040
to buy me stuff. No one has to donate money. No one has to do anything. If you just want to

39
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,200
watch the videos and enjoy them, I am very happy and very thankful that you're here.

40
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,400
I put these options up, not because I demand everyone simp for me or something,

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,840
but simply because people have been asking for them. And to be honest, I could use the help. So

42
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,600
if you want to financially support the channel, there are many ways to do so now. And if you just

43
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,640
want to hang out, well, then I am happy to have you here. Now that that's out of the way, let's

44
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,920
talk about Kamala Harris guys, because she was the VP pick for Joe Biden. I know everyone wanted

45
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,440
the Bernie Biden ticket because that was kind of unrealistic though. People really thought it was

46
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,400
going to be the Biden Hillary ticket. That would have immediately torpedoed any chances of him

47
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,760
winning. But to be honest, with the way that the radical left is writing about police right now,

48
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,760
choosing Kamala Harris has basically done that as well. Let's quickly go over Kamala Harris's

49
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,360
record. In 2014, the LA Times published the article, federal judges order California to

50
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,120
expand prison releases. Federal judges on Friday ordered California to launch a new parole program

51
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,400
that could free more prisoners early, ruling the state had failed to fully implement an order last

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,680
February intended to reduce unconstitutional crowding. The judges for a second time ordered

53
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,880
that all non-violent second strike offenders be eligible for parole after serving half of

54
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,760
their sentence. They told corrections officials to submit new plans for that parole process by

55
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,840
December 1st. Most of those prisoners work as groundskeepers, janitors, and in prison kitchens,

56
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,560
with wages that range from 8 cents to 37 cents per hour. Lawyers for the attorney general Kamala

57
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,400
Harris have argued in court that if forced to release these inmates, prisons would lose an

58
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,480
important labor pool. I guess keeping non-violent criminals in prison even though they're eligible

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,840
for parole in order to make them work in the old sweatshops is a priority for Kamala Harris.

60
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,240
In 2010, the Guardian reported that Kamala Harris was behind a major push in San Francisco

61
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,400
to lock up parents if their children skipped school.

62
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,600
So I decided I was going to start prosecuting parents for truancy.

63
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,400
Well, this was a little controversial in San Francisco.

64
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,600
And frankly, my staff went bananas. They were very concerned because we didn't know at the

65
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,240
time whether I was going to have an opponent in my reelection race. But I said, look, I'm done.

66
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,960
This is a serious issue, and I've got a little political capital, and I'm going to spend some

67
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:24,240
of it. And this is what we did. We recognized that in that initiative, as a prosecutor in law

68
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,560
enforcement, I have a huge stick. The school district has got a carrot.

69
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,040
This article, published in the New York Times, titled Kamala Harris was not a progressive

70
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,160
prosecutor, outlines a number of significant events. Time after time, when progressives

71
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,120
urged her to embrace criminal justice reforms as a district attorney and then the state's

72
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,720
attorney general, Ms. Harris opposed them or stayed silent. Most troubling, Ms. Harris

73
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,200
fought tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through

74
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,480
official misconduct that included evidence tampering, false testimony, and the suppression

75
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,640
of crucial information by prosecutors. Consider her record as San Francisco's

76
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,720
district attorney from 2004 to 2011. Ms. Harris was criticized in 2010 for withholding information

77
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,920
about a police laboratory technician who had been accused of intentionally sabotaging her work

78
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,240
and stealing drugs from the lab. After a memo surfaced that Ms. Harris' deputies knew about

79
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,200
the technician's wrongdoing and recent conviction but failed to alert defense lawyers, a judge

80
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,240
condemned Ms. Harris' indifference to the systemic violation of the defendant's constitutional rights.

81
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,880
Ms. Harris lost that case, and more than 600 cases handled by the corrupt technician were dismissed.

82
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,040
How many of those 600 were actually guilty and are now roaming the streets because of

83
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,720
the corruption of Kamala Harris? She also championed state legislation under

84
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,680
which parents whose children were found to be habitually truant in elementary school

85
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,440
could be prosecuted despite concerns that would disproportionately affect low-income

86
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,920
people of color. In 2014, she declined to take a position on Proposition 47,

87
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,600
a ballot initiative approved by voters that reduced certain low-level felonies to misdemeanors.

88
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,520
She laughed that year when a reporter asked if she would support the legalization of marijuana

89
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,800
for recreational use. In 2015, she opposed a bill requiring her office to investigate shootings

90
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,000
involving officers, and she refused to support statewide standards regulating the use of body-worn

91
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,800
cameras by police officers. Worst of all is her record in wrongful conviction cases,

92
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,440
considered George Gage, an electrician with no criminal record who was charged in 1999

93
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,440
with sexually abusing his stepdaughter, who reported the allegations years later.

94
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,680
Afterward, the judge discovered that the prosecutor had unlawfully held back potentially

95
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,080
exculpatory evidence, including medical reports indicating that the stepdaughter had been

96
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,560
repeatedly untruthful with law enforcement. Her mother even described her as a pathological liar.

97
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,480
In 2015, when the case reached the United States Court of Appeals,

98
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,440
Ms. Harris' prosecutors defended the conviction. They pointed out that Mr. Gage, while forced to

99
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,480
act as his own lawyer, had not properly raised the legal issue in the lower court.

100
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,760
The judges acknowledged this impediment and sent the case to mediation,

101
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,720
a clear signal for Ms. Harris to dismiss the case. When she refused to budge, the court upheld the

102
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,840
conviction on that technicality. Mr. Gage is still in prison serving a 70-year sentence. This case

103
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,920
is not an outlier. Ms. Harris also fought to keep Daniel Larson in prison on a 28-year-to-life

104
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,560
sentence for his possession of a concealed weapon even though his trial lawyer was incompetent

105
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,720
and there was compelling evidence of his innocence. Relying on a technicality again,

106
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,440
Ms. Harris argued that Mr. Larson failed to raise his legal arguments in a timely fashion.

107
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,680
This time, she lost. She defended Johnny Baca's conviction for murder even though

108
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,240
judges found that a prosecutor presented false testimony at the trial. She relented only after

109
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,480
a video of the oral argument received national attention and embarrassed her office. And then

110
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,280
there's Kevin Cooper, the death row inmate whose trial was infected by racism and corruption.

111
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,680
He sought advanced DNA testing to prove his innocence, but Ms. Harris opposed it.

112
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,760
After the New York Times' expose of the case went viral, she reversed her position.

113
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,680
In Kamala Harris' memoir, she writes that America has a deep and dark history of people using the

114
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,240
power of the prosecutor as an instrument of injustice. I know this history well,

115
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,640
of innocent men framed, of charges brought against people without sufficient evidence,

116
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,680
of prosecutors hiding information that would exonerate defendants,

117
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,120
of the disproportionate application of the law. All too often, she was on the wrong side of that

118
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,080
history. And of course, Vice had no problem reporting on this back on October 10th, 2019.

119
00:09:49,120 --> 00:10:07,040
In this article from the Monterey Herald,

120
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,240
an article now only available on the Internet Wayback Machine, Kamala Harris backs asset

121
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,960
seizure before criminal charges. Civil asset forfeiture allows police to seize money and

122
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,920
property under a simple suspicion of that money and property being used for criminal activity,

123
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,720
even if there are no criminal charges. This law has allowed the police to steal from innocent

124
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,440
people, and entire PD budgets have been funded with deceased property. Even though the law is

125
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,880
very unpopular and arguably unconstitutional, Kamala Harris has made a career of publicly

126
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,920
supporting it. She sponsored a bill to allow a seizure of profits without charges, and as this

127
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,560
article states, in 2011 she opposed a bill that would have reformed the procedure. Thankfully,

128
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,760
there was at least one person on one of the Democratic debate stages willing to

129
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,960
stand up to Kamala Harris and tell her exactly what she was to her face.

130
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,920
would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so.

131
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,640
She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of

132
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,280
California. And she fought to keep cash bail system in place that impacts poor people in

133
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:39,680
the worst kind of way. Oh, Tulsi, you're too good for the DNC. But all this criticism is just racist.

134
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,880
It's just racist. She's female. She's black. She's an Asian American. That's all you need to know,

135
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,040
right? I mean, her dad's Jamaican. Her mom's from India. I always thought, you know,

136
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,440
Indian and Asian as being two separate things, even though they are both technically from the

137
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,480
continent of Asia. But I guess she's Asian American in the same way that someone from

138
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,800
India is Asian American. Okay, fine. Her dad's Jamaican, and there's probably at least a little

139
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,120
bit of black ancestry there because a lot of Jamaicans are a mixture of native Jamaicans and

140
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:18,160
African slaves brought over. So I guess she's kind of black. I guess being dark skinned is

141
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:24,000
enough to qualify for dem reparations. Unless, of course, you're family owned slaves, Kamala.

142
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,360
Kamala Harris's father drops another big bombshell about her family history. Forget marijuana. This

143
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,080
is big. My roots go back within my lifetime to my paternal grandmother, Miss Krishi,

144
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,560
a descendant of Hamilton Brown, who was on record as a plantation and slave owner

145
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,240
and the founder of Brownstown. Interestingly enough, Senator Harris favors paying reparation

146
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,200
to American blacks who have been impacted by slavery and discrimination. Well, how much are

147
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,240
you going to have to pay out Kamala? Like, I think that the whole reparation stuff is nonsense. But

148
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,680
if that is the rule book that the left insists on playing by, Kamala's got to pay up. I have the

149
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,480
great honor to announce that I've picked Kamala Harris, a fearless fighter for the little guy,

150
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,040
and one of the country's finest public servants as my running mate. Oh, really,

151
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,520
Joe? Are you sure about that? What about that time when she called you a racist to your face?

152
00:13:34,480 --> 00:14:01,120
What about that time when she said that she believes those people who accused you of sexual

153
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,320
assault? Hell, what about that time when she appeared on TV looking like a space alien?

154
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,720
Holy shit, Kamala, you're supposed to let the Botox settle in a little bit before you start

155
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,680
doing stuff. Damn, maybe there actually are reptilian shapeshifters. But now that Kamala

156
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,040
has been ordained, everyone's being told to get in line. Even Bernie, who immediately did so,

157
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,520
obviously. You know, I was actually a Bernie bro back in 2016. The minute that I saw him

158
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,360
cuck out to Hillary, hell, the minute that I saw him cuck out to those Black Lives Matter

159
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,680
activists who stormed the stage. That was when I basically realized the man doesn't have a spine.

160
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,120
And here he is telling the communist left to shut the fuck up and get in line. The progressives have

161
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,600
always been a useful tool to the Democrats. And of course, we all know that a vote for Joe Biden

162
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,400
is a vote for Kamala Harris. Even Biden knows it. I've decided that Kamala Harris is the best person

163
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,960
to help me take this fight to Donald Trump and Mike Pence, and then to lead this nation starting

164
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:59,040
in January 2021. Biden, you're supposed to be leading. Biden. It's not supposed to be here.

165
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,280
It's not supposed to be here. It's supposed to be you. Joe Biden made the pick that maximized his

166
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,000
chances of continuing to make the race a straight referendum on Trump while also selecting somebody

167
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,240
whose resume suggests being ready to step in if and when Biden decides to step aside. The media's

168
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,480
role in this is to prepare the people for a Kamala Harris presidency. They're already starting the

169
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,240
preconditioning to get you to accept it when it happens. Listen, I know, I know Trump's not

170
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,720
perfect. I have disagreed with him a fair amount myself, but if I were an American, I'd be voting

171
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,080
Trump. This is an absolute shit show. Kamala Harris is a disgrace. Joe Biden's a disgrace.

172
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,640
They both have long standing tough on crime records. And they're currently trying to court

173
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,880
a crowd of people who think that all cops are bastards and want the complete defunding and

174
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,040
abolition of the police. This is not going to go well for them. And I'm pretty sure that with this

175
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,600
pick, Trump has got 2020 in the bag.
