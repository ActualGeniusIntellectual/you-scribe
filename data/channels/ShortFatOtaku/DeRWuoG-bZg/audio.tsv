0	4000	Hey guys, a quick announcement before I begin the video. A lot of people have asked me for
4000	8800	other options to financially support the channel. I guess because they don't want to give YouTube or
8800	12880	Twitch a cut of the Super Chat or of the Twitch sub. So I've gone ahead and set up a few other
12880	17840	options. If you check out the description of videos on my SFO channel or of the Game Boomers
17840	21680	stream VODs over on the Game Boomer channel, you'll see something like this now. I've decided
21680	26000	to update all the links. And yes, you can always still sub at Twitch. You can always give it
26000	30000	subscribestar, Patreon, or PayPal. I put a Streamlabs link in there as well because
30560	34800	people really wanted me to get Streamlabs, so there it is. One guy asked for cash app,
34800	38640	and I didn't do that, I guess because I'm too much of a boomer to figure it out. I tried.
38640	41840	There's a few other options down here that I can talk about as well. This is my Amazon affiliate
41840	46720	link. If you click this, anything that you buy after you click that link in that window
46720	51520	should give me, I think, a 5% cut. The price that you pay for goods on Amazon won't go up.
51520	54880	Amazon will just give me a little bit of money. Some people for some reason have also wanted to
54880	61920	outright buy me stuff for the show, so I made a public Amazon Canada and Amazon US wish list.
61920	66080	Now, the items on this list are actually pretty expensive because it's all show equipment,
66080	71200	and I do not expect anyone to buy anything on this list, okay? A few people asked in DMs like,
71200	74880	hey, I want to buy you some equipment. And I'm like, dude, equipment's expensive to run shows
74880	80720	like this. But they insisted, so I made a list of all the things that I don't necessarily need
80720	84080	immediately because if it's an immediate need, I just buy it myself. But stuff that could really
84080	87760	help the show's quality if I were to get it. So everything on these lists, it's either products
87760	93920	that I want to use on Game Boomers or review on the dev kit or sometimes both. It's show equipment,
93920	97680	computer equipment, stuff that I can use to increase the quality of all my shows. So there's
97680	101040	computer equipment on there. There's some specialized equipment on there. I didn't put
101040	105840	games on there, like games that I would like to stream on Game Boomers because that's a bit too
105840	111040	celery, I think, in my opinion. I don't want to just ask people for games. But stuff that I know
111040	115120	that I will use to make the show better, I put on the list. And finally, there's also a Humble
115120	119120	Bundle affiliate link there because I've been a Humble Bundle partner for a while. When you click
119120	122400	on that link, you get something like this. Thank you for supporting Short Fire Otaku. And then
122960	128080	basically anything that you buy on the website in this window, you can choose to give me a cut of
128080	131520	it. So let's say you wanted to buy, actually, there's no really good bundles right now,
131520	136400	is there? Let's say double fine. Why not? You're going to go, you're going to get the bundle. Okay.
136400	139200	What you can do is you can go to here. It says choose where your money goes.
140080	144400	There's publishers, charities, a tip to Humble Bundle, and also me. And you can actually adjust
144400	151360	these sliders to give me as much or as little of the cut or anybody else of the cut as you like.
151360	155680	So if you do buy games through Humble Bundle, that is a great way to also support the channel.
155680	158880	And all those links will be in the description of all the videos going forward. And I also want
158880	164000	to make it absolutely clear that there is no obligation to ever do any of this. No one has
164000	169040	to buy me stuff. No one has to donate money. No one has to do anything. If you just want to
169040	173200	watch the videos and enjoy them, I am very happy and very thankful that you're here.
173200	178400	I put these options up, not because I demand everyone simp for me or something,
178400	183840	but simply because people have been asking for them. And to be honest, I could use the help. So
183840	187600	if you want to financially support the channel, there are many ways to do so now. And if you just
187600	190640	want to hang out, well, then I am happy to have you here. Now that that's out of the way, let's
190640	197920	talk about Kamala Harris guys, because she was the VP pick for Joe Biden. I know everyone wanted
197920	201440	the Bernie Biden ticket because that was kind of unrealistic though. People really thought it was
201440	206400	going to be the Biden Hillary ticket. That would have immediately torpedoed any chances of him
206400	211760	winning. But to be honest, with the way that the radical left is writing about police right now,
211760	215760	choosing Kamala Harris has basically done that as well. Let's quickly go over Kamala Harris's
215760	221360	record. In 2014, the LA Times published the article, federal judges order California to
221360	227120	expand prison releases. Federal judges on Friday ordered California to launch a new parole program
227120	232400	that could free more prisoners early, ruling the state had failed to fully implement an order last
232400	237680	February intended to reduce unconstitutional crowding. The judges for a second time ordered
237680	242880	that all non-violent second strike offenders be eligible for parole after serving half of
242880	247760	their sentence. They told corrections officials to submit new plans for that parole process by
247760	253840	December 1st. Most of those prisoners work as groundskeepers, janitors, and in prison kitchens,
253840	260560	with wages that range from 8 cents to 37 cents per hour. Lawyers for the attorney general Kamala
260560	266400	Harris have argued in court that if forced to release these inmates, prisons would lose an
266400	272480	important labor pool. I guess keeping non-violent criminals in prison even though they're eligible
272480	277840	for parole in order to make them work in the old sweatshops is a priority for Kamala Harris.
277840	284240	In 2010, the Guardian reported that Kamala Harris was behind a major push in San Francisco
284800	288400	to lock up parents if their children skipped school.
288400	293600	So I decided I was going to start prosecuting parents for truancy.
293600	298400	Well, this was a little controversial in San Francisco.
301200	305600	And frankly, my staff went bananas. They were very concerned because we didn't know at the
305600	310240	time whether I was going to have an opponent in my reelection race. But I said, look, I'm done.
310880	314960	This is a serious issue, and I've got a little political capital, and I'm going to spend some
314960	324240	of it. And this is what we did. We recognized that in that initiative, as a prosecutor in law
324240	328560	enforcement, I have a huge stick. The school district has got a carrot.
328560	333040	This article, published in the New York Times, titled Kamala Harris was not a progressive
333040	338160	prosecutor, outlines a number of significant events. Time after time, when progressives
338160	343120	urged her to embrace criminal justice reforms as a district attorney and then the state's
343120	348720	attorney general, Ms. Harris opposed them or stayed silent. Most troubling, Ms. Harris
348720	353200	fought tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through
353200	358480	official misconduct that included evidence tampering, false testimony, and the suppression
358480	362640	of crucial information by prosecutors. Consider her record as San Francisco's
362640	368720	district attorney from 2004 to 2011. Ms. Harris was criticized in 2010 for withholding information
368720	373920	about a police laboratory technician who had been accused of intentionally sabotaging her work
373920	378240	and stealing drugs from the lab. After a memo surfaced that Ms. Harris' deputies knew about
378240	383200	the technician's wrongdoing and recent conviction but failed to alert defense lawyers, a judge
383200	388240	condemned Ms. Harris' indifference to the systemic violation of the defendant's constitutional rights.
388240	394880	Ms. Harris lost that case, and more than 600 cases handled by the corrupt technician were dismissed.
394880	399040	How many of those 600 were actually guilty and are now roaming the streets because of
399040	402720	the corruption of Kamala Harris? She also championed state legislation under
402720	405680	which parents whose children were found to be habitually truant in elementary school
405680	409440	could be prosecuted despite concerns that would disproportionately affect low-income
409440	415920	people of color. In 2014, she declined to take a position on Proposition 47,
415920	421600	a ballot initiative approved by voters that reduced certain low-level felonies to misdemeanors.
421600	425520	She laughed that year when a reporter asked if she would support the legalization of marijuana
425520	430800	for recreational use. In 2015, she opposed a bill requiring her office to investigate shootings
430800	436000	involving officers, and she refused to support statewide standards regulating the use of body-worn
436000	440800	cameras by police officers. Worst of all is her record in wrongful conviction cases,
440800	445440	considered George Gage, an electrician with no criminal record who was charged in 1999
445440	449440	with sexually abusing his stepdaughter, who reported the allegations years later.
449440	453680	Afterward, the judge discovered that the prosecutor had unlawfully held back potentially
453680	458080	exculpatory evidence, including medical reports indicating that the stepdaughter had been
458080	462560	repeatedly untruthful with law enforcement. Her mother even described her as a pathological liar.
462560	466480	In 2015, when the case reached the United States Court of Appeals,
466480	471440	Ms. Harris' prosecutors defended the conviction. They pointed out that Mr. Gage, while forced to
471440	476480	act as his own lawyer, had not properly raised the legal issue in the lower court.
476480	479760	The judges acknowledged this impediment and sent the case to mediation,
479760	484720	a clear signal for Ms. Harris to dismiss the case. When she refused to budge, the court upheld the
484720	489840	conviction on that technicality. Mr. Gage is still in prison serving a 70-year sentence. This case
489840	495920	is not an outlier. Ms. Harris also fought to keep Daniel Larson in prison on a 28-year-to-life
495920	500560	sentence for his possession of a concealed weapon even though his trial lawyer was incompetent
500560	504720	and there was compelling evidence of his innocence. Relying on a technicality again,
504720	509440	Ms. Harris argued that Mr. Larson failed to raise his legal arguments in a timely fashion.
509440	513680	This time, she lost. She defended Johnny Baca's conviction for murder even though
513680	518240	judges found that a prosecutor presented false testimony at the trial. She relented only after
518240	522480	a video of the oral argument received national attention and embarrassed her office. And then
522480	527280	there's Kevin Cooper, the death row inmate whose trial was infected by racism and corruption.
527280	531680	He sought advanced DNA testing to prove his innocence, but Ms. Harris opposed it.
531680	535760	After the New York Times' expose of the case went viral, she reversed her position.
535760	541680	In Kamala Harris' memoir, she writes that America has a deep and dark history of people using the
541680	546240	power of the prosecutor as an instrument of injustice. I know this history well,
546240	550640	of innocent men framed, of charges brought against people without sufficient evidence,
550640	553680	of prosecutors hiding information that would exonerate defendants,
553680	559120	of the disproportionate application of the law. All too often, she was on the wrong side of that
559120	564080	history. And of course, Vice had no problem reporting on this back on October 10th, 2019.
589120	607040	In this article from the Monterey Herald,
607040	612240	an article now only available on the Internet Wayback Machine, Kamala Harris backs asset
612240	616960	seizure before criminal charges. Civil asset forfeiture allows police to seize money and
616960	621920	property under a simple suspicion of that money and property being used for criminal activity,
621920	626720	even if there are no criminal charges. This law has allowed the police to steal from innocent
626720	631440	people, and entire PD budgets have been funded with deceased property. Even though the law is
631440	636880	very unpopular and arguably unconstitutional, Kamala Harris has made a career of publicly
636880	641920	supporting it. She sponsored a bill to allow a seizure of profits without charges, and as this
641920	646560	article states, in 2011 she opposed a bill that would have reformed the procedure. Thankfully,
646560	651760	there was at least one person on one of the Democratic debate stages willing to
651760	654960	stand up to Kamala Harris and tell her exactly what she was to her face.
676560	681920	would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so.
681920	686640	She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of
686640	693280	California. And she fought to keep cash bail system in place that impacts poor people in
693280	699680	the worst kind of way. Oh, Tulsi, you're too good for the DNC. But all this criticism is just racist.
699680	704880	It's just racist. She's female. She's black. She's an Asian American. That's all you need to know,
704880	711040	right? I mean, her dad's Jamaican. Her mom's from India. I always thought, you know,
711040	715440	Indian and Asian as being two separate things, even though they are both technically from the
715440	720480	continent of Asia. But I guess she's Asian American in the same way that someone from
720480	724800	India is Asian American. Okay, fine. Her dad's Jamaican, and there's probably at least a little
724800	731120	bit of black ancestry there because a lot of Jamaicans are a mixture of native Jamaicans and
731200	738160	African slaves brought over. So I guess she's kind of black. I guess being dark skinned is
738160	744000	enough to qualify for dem reparations. Unless, of course, you're family owned slaves, Kamala.
744000	749360	Kamala Harris's father drops another big bombshell about her family history. Forget marijuana. This
749360	754080	is big. My roots go back within my lifetime to my paternal grandmother, Miss Krishi,
754080	758560	a descendant of Hamilton Brown, who was on record as a plantation and slave owner
758560	764240	and the founder of Brownstown. Interestingly enough, Senator Harris favors paying reparation
764240	769200	to American blacks who have been impacted by slavery and discrimination. Well, how much are
769200	774240	you going to have to pay out Kamala? Like, I think that the whole reparation stuff is nonsense. But
774240	779680	if that is the rule book that the left insists on playing by, Kamala's got to pay up. I have the
779680	784480	great honor to announce that I've picked Kamala Harris, a fearless fighter for the little guy,
784480	789040	and one of the country's finest public servants as my running mate. Oh, really,
789040	793520	Joe? Are you sure about that? What about that time when she called you a racist to your face?
814480	841120	What about that time when she said that she believes those people who accused you of sexual
841120	846320	assault? Hell, what about that time when she appeared on TV looking like a space alien?
846320	850720	Holy shit, Kamala, you're supposed to let the Botox settle in a little bit before you start
850720	855680	doing stuff. Damn, maybe there actually are reptilian shapeshifters. But now that Kamala
855680	861040	has been ordained, everyone's being told to get in line. Even Bernie, who immediately did so,
861040	865520	obviously. You know, I was actually a Bernie bro back in 2016. The minute that I saw him
865520	869360	cuck out to Hillary, hell, the minute that I saw him cuck out to those Black Lives Matter
869360	873680	activists who stormed the stage. That was when I basically realized the man doesn't have a spine.
873680	879120	And here he is telling the communist left to shut the fuck up and get in line. The progressives have
879120	883600	always been a useful tool to the Democrats. And of course, we all know that a vote for Joe Biden
883600	888400	is a vote for Kamala Harris. Even Biden knows it. I've decided that Kamala Harris is the best person
888400	892960	to help me take this fight to Donald Trump and Mike Pence, and then to lead this nation starting
892960	899040	in January 2021. Biden, you're supposed to be leading. Biden. It's not supposed to be here.
899040	903280	It's not supposed to be here. It's supposed to be you. Joe Biden made the pick that maximized his
903280	908000	chances of continuing to make the race a straight referendum on Trump while also selecting somebody
908000	914240	whose resume suggests being ready to step in if and when Biden decides to step aside. The media's
914240	918480	role in this is to prepare the people for a Kamala Harris presidency. They're already starting the
918480	922240	preconditioning to get you to accept it when it happens. Listen, I know, I know Trump's not
922240	926720	perfect. I have disagreed with him a fair amount myself, but if I were an American, I'd be voting
926720	932080	Trump. This is an absolute shit show. Kamala Harris is a disgrace. Joe Biden's a disgrace.
932080	936640	They both have long standing tough on crime records. And they're currently trying to court
936640	940880	a crowd of people who think that all cops are bastards and want the complete defunding and
940880	945040	abolition of the police. This is not going to go well for them. And I'm pretty sure that with this
945040	947600	pick, Trump has got 2020 in the bag.
