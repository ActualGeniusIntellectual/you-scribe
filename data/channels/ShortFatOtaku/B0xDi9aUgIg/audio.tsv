0	6480	Hey guys, Dev here. Work does in fact continue on those Canadian election videos that I was
6480	12240	talking about. However, I am not able to put one out today just because, frankly, they are quite
12240	18080	large projects and I've been working on them a fair bit. I want them to actually be reasonably
18080	22160	high quality when they come out. I want them to be, you know, kind of, I want them to be larger
22160	27280	video essays rather than short one-offs, so I'm going to keep plugging away. But that also means
27280	31760	I didn't really have anything to put out today. So while I was looking at Twitter for updates on
31760	36880	the whole Blizzard boycott Hong Kong protest thing, I noticed that Twitter was actually
36880	43280	pushing this hashtag. It's called Day of the Girl with its own little icon there. Now, I don't know
43280	48320	what Day of the Girl is. Is it International Women's Day? That's probably a different,
48320	54960	it wasn't that like in the spring. I mean, could it be International Girls Day or is Day of the
54960	60720	Girl just a different intersectional holiday than International Girls Day? Is this the Gender Wage
60720	64640	Gap Day? Because we are getting to the point in the year where people like to talk about the
64640	69600	Gender Wage Gap Day where women stop making money because they make less for the same amount of work
69600	73840	or so they say. But I don't think it's any of those. I think Day of the Girl is just the next
73840	78720	new thing that they're pushing. At the same time, they're also pushing for today Coming Out Day.
78720	85040	So it's both Day of the Girl and Coming Out Day, I guess. It's two intersectional holidays today
85040	89440	for the price of one. The very first thing that I see when I click on that Day of the Girl hashtag
89440	99200	is something from Reese Witherspoon retweeted by Bob Chipman. Movie Bob himself. This Day of the
99200	105520	Girl, I'm joining activists around the world and sharing my favorite fierce fictional female. We
105520	110560	need to see more roles like Shiri from Black Panther so girls can dream big. You know that
111600	116560	there were actually female leads in movies, strong female leads in movies,
116560	124240	before the Marvel Cinematic Universe? It's not like pop culture was a wasteland before 2009.
124240	128240	You know that, right, Reese Witherspoon? You know that, Bob Chipman? I mean, it really seems
128240	133280	like everyone's forgotten about Captain Janeway from Star Trek or Sigourney Weaver playing the
133280	137840	lead in Aliens and things like that. Or quite frankly, and I know this labels me as a weeb,
137840	143280	but all of the amazingly strong anime protagonists that are women. Let's keep scrolling here.
143840	148640	Sesame Street. From doctor to journalist to astronaut, girls can be anything they want to be.
148640	152480	Girls are strong, determined, and capable of accomplishing their dreams.
153040	158560	Happy International Day of the Girl. Okay, so if this is like a youth-focused thing,
158560	163040	you think it would also be very important to have like an international day of the boy.
163040	166800	You know, it does seem like boys are doing worse and worse in school all the time. They're getting
166800	171600	more and more medicated. Maybe some kind of positive encouragement for young boys would
171600	176720	be a good thing as well. This is obviously positive, and in that case, if it is only
176720	181360	what it seems to be on the surface, that's fine. But there really should be a boy's equivalent at
181360	187520	some point as well. I mean, have you ever heard of one or seen one? I haven't. Oh, check this out,
187600	193040	check this out. This is the tweet that really inspired me to do this, to do this video here.
193760	198800	Before you watch it though, check this out. We've got Kamala Harris. Hey, I know that you want to
198800	203440	tweet about Day of the Girl because it's a trending hashtag, but your campaign is failing.
203440	209040	You might as well just give it up. But dude, watch this video from Girls Who Code. Learn to code,
209040	215920	all right? Today is the March for the Sisterhood, the first all-digital march in history created for
215920	220160	girls by Girls Who Code. For the first time ever, you can march from anywhere in the world
220160	224160	to bring awareness to the issues you're passionate about. Join us now. You know,
226320	229200	point of a march is that you actually do it in real life. Like you walk,
230000	237920	you go somewhere. You can't have an all-digital march. That is literally just slacktivism.
237920	243120	It's keyboard activism. That's all it is. It's believing that hashtags and retweets actually
243120	244320	matter.
273360	276320	I march so that women always have the right to choose.
282560	289920	I march for getting up instead of giving up. For a movement that changes lives. I march for me.
289920	300320	For me. I march for her. I march for her. I march for you. I march for you. I march for sisterhood.
303120	310800	I think that might have been the most cancerous thing I've ever seen in my life.
310800	314480	Okay, let's just give us another watch here for a second, all right? Hold on.
319680	325120	First of all, you can't possibly convince me that all these women are coders. There's no fucking
325120	334640	way. I march to take up space. Well, to be fair, I know I'm no one to talk, but this individual
334640	341120	seems to be taking up more than enough space already. At the same time, have you noticed
341120	347680	that does seem to be a talking point of a lot of SJWs, the whole take up space thing? It's like
347680	355040	quite literally just exist and be useless and do nothing, actually taking up space and nothing else.
355680	363040	As if that's a virtue. I march because migration is a human right.
363840	368960	Since fucking when? I know when they're saying this, it shows three women who are all taking
368960	374880	up a lot of space themselves. They're marching and they're migrating from one side of the road
374880	386000	to the other. But migration is a human right? Is it? How much of an upper class bourgeois asshole
386000	391920	do you have to be to think that your ability to go on vacations and migrate around the world and
392560	398480	be a citizen of nowhere, be a true globalist, a true cosmopolitan is a human right? You should
398480	402560	just be able to go wherever you like, stay wherever you like. Screw the laws of countries
402560	405760	that you happen to be going through. Screw the people of those countries. You know what? You
405760	412960	can just migrate wherever you want. No. Jesus. For everyone on a gender journey.
414720	425200	What qualifies as a gender journey? Isn't that every form of life in this? It's like a single
425200	431040	cell organism that has no gender and just splits off and reproduces a sexually. Aren't we all on
431040	439120	a gender journey? What does that mean? What is it? What does any of this mean?
440480	447840	Because equal work means equal pay. You say equal work means equal pay as you show off a woman
447840	454160	who is pregnant and by definition will be doing less than equal work.
455920	460560	I mean, I'm not saying that she shouldn't. I mean, she's pregnant. She has to take time off and
461680	467600	go be a mother and that's fair, but you're still not at your job. Why should you be paid as if you
467600	477920	are? I really got to ask about that African tribal music. I don't know, man. Getting back to Twitter
477920	484960	for a second though, today is day of the girl, which should be every day. Really? Every single
484960	490480	day. I assume you also believe that every single day should be day of the boy then, right?
491280	497520	How come they all say fierce? Fierce. You scroll back up here. There's an anime one up here
497520	505440	and they say the fiercest leading ladies. What is with the word fierce? Oh, yeah. Fruits basket.
505440	510240	Toru Honda from fruits basket. Yeah, I've seen fruits basket. She is the opposite of what I
510240	516960	would call fierce. Girls can do anything they set their mind to. Okay. Inspire, create, lead, resist,
516960	521760	speak, write, discover, descent, soar. I thought this was, first of all,
523600	528240	Justice Ginsburg is looking about 50 years too young for this picture, but in general,
528240	534640	I thought that this was about girls, not women. International Women's Day is a different day, in
534640	542720	fact. Strike. Oh, shit. Is that Greta Thunberg? Is she going on strike again? Hold on, hold on.
542720	548160	Wonder, resist, honor, innovate, love, hope, explore, rebel, imagine, marvel,
548160	557760	believe, learn, work, slay. All right. All right. Sure. It's literally just every single
557760	564000	female protagonist. And at this point they have had to resort to ones that were made up in stories
564000	568480	because I guess there's not enough female historical characters because there's not enough
568720	574000	actual historical people. I don't know. This all girl firefighter team is from a Polish village
574000	578960	where no boys have been born in 10 years. You know, I think that's the plot of a porn. Oh,
578960	583680	the United Nations. Girls are unscripted. Girls are unstoppable. Girls can do anything and
583680	590400	everything. See, as you scroll through here, you notice that a lot of these are obviously quite
590400	596400	positive and I can understand the positive effects that they want to have, but it's good to encourage
596400	602880	and empower everyone, not just one gender of children, especially when one gender of children
602880	608720	and it's not girls are doing worse in school and are in fact becoming more and more withdrawn from
608720	613440	society as they grow into young adults. Overheard my four year old daughter dropping some knowledge
613440	617440	on her two year old baby sister while they were watching last night's town hall. You can be a
617440	622080	congresswoman and a mommy. I'm sure that's what they were saying. I'm sure this wasn't just
622080	626720	opposed picture because you wanted to have a woke child you can put on the internet for points.
626720	630640	In any case, this is all very interesting stuff. You know, girls being empowered,
630640	634160	girls posting on Twitter, girls talking with other girls, girls encouraging each other. You know,
634160	640080	very good. As all of this female centric celebration happens, I guess the men of
640080	645280	society will in fact be not celebrating because they'll be too busy actually keeping things
645280	646480	running.
