00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
Hey guys, Dev here. Work does in fact continue on those Canadian election videos that I was

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,240
talking about. However, I am not able to put one out today just because, frankly, they are quite

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,080
large projects and I've been working on them a fair bit. I want them to actually be reasonably

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,160
high quality when they come out. I want them to be, you know, kind of, I want them to be larger

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,280
video essays rather than short one-offs, so I'm going to keep plugging away. But that also means

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,760
I didn't really have anything to put out today. So while I was looking at Twitter for updates on

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,880
the whole Blizzard boycott Hong Kong protest thing, I noticed that Twitter was actually

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,280
pushing this hashtag. It's called Day of the Girl with its own little icon there. Now, I don't know

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,320
what Day of the Girl is. Is it International Women's Day? That's probably a different,

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,960
it wasn't that like in the spring. I mean, could it be International Girls Day or is Day of the

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,720
Girl just a different intersectional holiday than International Girls Day? Is this the Gender Wage

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,640
Gap Day? Because we are getting to the point in the year where people like to talk about the

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,600
Gender Wage Gap Day where women stop making money because they make less for the same amount of work

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,840
or so they say. But I don't think it's any of those. I think Day of the Girl is just the next

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,720
new thing that they're pushing. At the same time, they're also pushing for today Coming Out Day.

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,040
So it's both Day of the Girl and Coming Out Day, I guess. It's two intersectional holidays today

17
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,440
for the price of one. The very first thing that I see when I click on that Day of the Girl hashtag

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:39,200
is something from Reese Witherspoon retweeted by Bob Chipman. Movie Bob himself. This Day of the

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,520
Girl, I'm joining activists around the world and sharing my favorite fierce fictional female. We

20
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,560
need to see more roles like Shiri from Black Panther so girls can dream big. You know that

21
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,560
there were actually female leads in movies, strong female leads in movies,

22
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:04,240
before the Marvel Cinematic Universe? It's not like pop culture was a wasteland before 2009.

23
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,240
You know that, right, Reese Witherspoon? You know that, Bob Chipman? I mean, it really seems

24
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,280
like everyone's forgotten about Captain Janeway from Star Trek or Sigourney Weaver playing the

25
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,840
lead in Aliens and things like that. Or quite frankly, and I know this labels me as a weeb,

26
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,280
but all of the amazingly strong anime protagonists that are women. Let's keep scrolling here.

27
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,640
Sesame Street. From doctor to journalist to astronaut, girls can be anything they want to be.

28
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,480
Girls are strong, determined, and capable of accomplishing their dreams.

29
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,560
Happy International Day of the Girl. Okay, so if this is like a youth-focused thing,

30
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,040
you think it would also be very important to have like an international day of the boy.

31
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,800
You know, it does seem like boys are doing worse and worse in school all the time. They're getting

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,600
more and more medicated. Maybe some kind of positive encouragement for young boys would

33
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,720
be a good thing as well. This is obviously positive, and in that case, if it is only

34
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,360
what it seems to be on the surface, that's fine. But there really should be a boy's equivalent at

35
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,520
some point as well. I mean, have you ever heard of one or seen one? I haven't. Oh, check this out,

36
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,040
check this out. This is the tweet that really inspired me to do this, to do this video here.

37
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,800
Before you watch it though, check this out. We've got Kamala Harris. Hey, I know that you want to

38
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,440
tweet about Day of the Girl because it's a trending hashtag, but your campaign is failing.

39
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,040
You might as well just give it up. But dude, watch this video from Girls Who Code. Learn to code,

40
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,920
all right? Today is the March for the Sisterhood, the first all-digital march in history created for

41
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,160
girls by Girls Who Code. For the first time ever, you can march from anywhere in the world

42
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,160
to bring awareness to the issues you're passionate about. Join us now. You know,

43
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,200
point of a march is that you actually do it in real life. Like you walk,

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,920
you go somewhere. You can't have an all-digital march. That is literally just slacktivism.

45
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,120
It's keyboard activism. That's all it is. It's believing that hashtags and retweets actually

46
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,320
matter.

47
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,320
I march so that women always have the right to choose.

48
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,920
I march for getting up instead of giving up. For a movement that changes lives. I march for me.

49
00:04:49,920 --> 00:05:00,320
For me. I march for her. I march for her. I march for you. I march for you. I march for sisterhood.

50
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:10,800
I think that might have been the most cancerous thing I've ever seen in my life.

51
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,480
Okay, let's just give us another watch here for a second, all right? Hold on.

52
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,120
First of all, you can't possibly convince me that all these women are coders. There's no fucking

53
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:34,640
way. I march to take up space. Well, to be fair, I know I'm no one to talk, but this individual

54
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,120
seems to be taking up more than enough space already. At the same time, have you noticed

55
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,680
that does seem to be a talking point of a lot of SJWs, the whole take up space thing? It's like

56
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:55,040
quite literally just exist and be useless and do nothing, actually taking up space and nothing else.

57
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:03,040
As if that's a virtue. I march because migration is a human right.

58
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,960
Since fucking when? I know when they're saying this, it shows three women who are all taking

59
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,880
up a lot of space themselves. They're marching and they're migrating from one side of the road

60
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:26,000
to the other. But migration is a human right? Is it? How much of an upper class bourgeois asshole

61
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,920
do you have to be to think that your ability to go on vacations and migrate around the world and

62
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,480
be a citizen of nowhere, be a true globalist, a true cosmopolitan is a human right? You should

63
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,560
just be able to go wherever you like, stay wherever you like. Screw the laws of countries

64
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,760
that you happen to be going through. Screw the people of those countries. You know what? You

65
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:52,960
can just migrate wherever you want. No. Jesus. For everyone on a gender journey.

66
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:05,200
What qualifies as a gender journey? Isn't that every form of life in this? It's like a single

67
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:11,040
cell organism that has no gender and just splits off and reproduces a sexually. Aren't we all on

68
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:19,120
a gender journey? What does that mean? What is it? What does any of this mean?

69
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:27,840
Because equal work means equal pay. You say equal work means equal pay as you show off a woman

70
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,160
who is pregnant and by definition will be doing less than equal work.

71
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,560
I mean, I'm not saying that she shouldn't. I mean, she's pregnant. She has to take time off and

72
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,600
go be a mother and that's fair, but you're still not at your job. Why should you be paid as if you

73
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:57,920
are? I really got to ask about that African tribal music. I don't know, man. Getting back to Twitter

74
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:04,960
for a second though, today is day of the girl, which should be every day. Really? Every single

75
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,480
day. I assume you also believe that every single day should be day of the boy then, right?

76
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,520
How come they all say fierce? Fierce. You scroll back up here. There's an anime one up here

77
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:25,440
and they say the fiercest leading ladies. What is with the word fierce? Oh, yeah. Fruits basket.

78
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,240
Toru Honda from fruits basket. Yeah, I've seen fruits basket. She is the opposite of what I

79
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,960
would call fierce. Girls can do anything they set their mind to. Okay. Inspire, create, lead, resist,

80
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,760
speak, write, discover, descent, soar. I thought this was, first of all,

81
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,240
Justice Ginsburg is looking about 50 years too young for this picture, but in general,

82
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,640
I thought that this was about girls, not women. International Women's Day is a different day, in

83
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:02,720
fact. Strike. Oh, shit. Is that Greta Thunberg? Is she going on strike again? Hold on, hold on.

84
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,160
Wonder, resist, honor, innovate, love, hope, explore, rebel, imagine, marvel,

85
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:17,760
believe, learn, work, slay. All right. All right. Sure. It's literally just every single

86
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,000
female protagonist. And at this point they have had to resort to ones that were made up in stories

87
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,480
because I guess there's not enough female historical characters because there's not enough

88
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,000
actual historical people. I don't know. This all girl firefighter team is from a Polish village

89
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,960
where no boys have been born in 10 years. You know, I think that's the plot of a porn. Oh,

90
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,680
the United Nations. Girls are unscripted. Girls are unstoppable. Girls can do anything and

91
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,400
everything. See, as you scroll through here, you notice that a lot of these are obviously quite

92
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:56,400
positive and I can understand the positive effects that they want to have, but it's good to encourage

93
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:02,880
and empower everyone, not just one gender of children, especially when one gender of children

94
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,720
and it's not girls are doing worse in school and are in fact becoming more and more withdrawn from

95
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,440
society as they grow into young adults. Overheard my four year old daughter dropping some knowledge

96
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,440
on her two year old baby sister while they were watching last night's town hall. You can be a

97
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,080
congresswoman and a mommy. I'm sure that's what they were saying. I'm sure this wasn't just

98
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,720
opposed picture because you wanted to have a woke child you can put on the internet for points.

99
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,640
In any case, this is all very interesting stuff. You know, girls being empowered,

100
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,160
girls posting on Twitter, girls talking with other girls, girls encouraging each other. You know,

101
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,080
very good. As all of this female centric celebration happens, I guess the men of

102
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,280
society will in fact be not celebrating because they'll be too busy actually keeping things

103
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,480
running.
