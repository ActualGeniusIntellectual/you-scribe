Hey guys, Dev here. Work does in fact continue on those Canadian election videos that I was

00:06.480 --> 00:12.240
talking about. However, I am not able to put one out today just because, frankly, they are quite

00:12.240 --> 00:18.080
large projects and I've been working on them a fair bit. I want them to actually be reasonably

00:18.080 --> 00:22.160
high quality when they come out. I want them to be, you know, kind of, I want them to be larger

00:22.160 --> 00:27.280
video essays rather than short one-offs, so I'm going to keep plugging away. But that also means

00:27.280 --> 00:31.760
I didn't really have anything to put out today. So while I was looking at Twitter for updates on

00:31.760 --> 00:36.880
the whole Blizzard boycott Hong Kong protest thing, I noticed that Twitter was actually

00:36.880 --> 00:43.280
pushing this hashtag. It's called Day of the Girl with its own little icon there. Now, I don't know

00:43.280 --> 00:48.320
what Day of the Girl is. Is it International Women's Day? That's probably a different,

00:48.320 --> 00:54.960
it wasn't that like in the spring. I mean, could it be International Girls Day or is Day of the

00:54.960 --> 01:00.720
Girl just a different intersectional holiday than International Girls Day? Is this the Gender Wage

01:00.720 --> 01:04.640
Gap Day? Because we are getting to the point in the year where people like to talk about the

01:04.640 --> 01:09.600
Gender Wage Gap Day where women stop making money because they make less for the same amount of work

01:09.600 --> 01:13.840
or so they say. But I don't think it's any of those. I think Day of the Girl is just the next

01:13.840 --> 01:18.720
new thing that they're pushing. At the same time, they're also pushing for today Coming Out Day.

01:18.720 --> 01:25.040
So it's both Day of the Girl and Coming Out Day, I guess. It's two intersectional holidays today

01:25.040 --> 01:29.440
for the price of one. The very first thing that I see when I click on that Day of the Girl hashtag

01:29.440 --> 01:39.200
is something from Reese Witherspoon retweeted by Bob Chipman. Movie Bob himself. This Day of the

01:39.200 --> 01:45.520
Girl, I'm joining activists around the world and sharing my favorite fierce fictional female. We

01:45.520 --> 01:50.560
need to see more roles like Shiri from Black Panther so girls can dream big. You know that

01:51.600 --> 01:56.560
there were actually female leads in movies, strong female leads in movies,

01:56.560 --> 02:04.240
before the Marvel Cinematic Universe? It's not like pop culture was a wasteland before 2009.

02:04.240 --> 02:08.240
You know that, right, Reese Witherspoon? You know that, Bob Chipman? I mean, it really seems

02:08.240 --> 02:13.280
like everyone's forgotten about Captain Janeway from Star Trek or Sigourney Weaver playing the

02:13.280 --> 02:17.840
lead in Aliens and things like that. Or quite frankly, and I know this labels me as a weeb,

02:17.840 --> 02:23.280
but all of the amazingly strong anime protagonists that are women. Let's keep scrolling here.

02:23.840 --> 02:28.640
Sesame Street. From doctor to journalist to astronaut, girls can be anything they want to be.

02:28.640 --> 02:32.480
Girls are strong, determined, and capable of accomplishing their dreams.

02:33.040 --> 02:38.560
Happy International Day of the Girl. Okay, so if this is like a youth-focused thing,

02:38.560 --> 02:43.040
you think it would also be very important to have like an international day of the boy.

02:43.040 --> 02:46.800
You know, it does seem like boys are doing worse and worse in school all the time. They're getting

02:46.800 --> 02:51.600
more and more medicated. Maybe some kind of positive encouragement for young boys would

02:51.600 --> 02:56.720
be a good thing as well. This is obviously positive, and in that case, if it is only

02:56.720 --> 03:01.360
what it seems to be on the surface, that's fine. But there really should be a boy's equivalent at

03:01.360 --> 03:07.520
some point as well. I mean, have you ever heard of one or seen one? I haven't. Oh, check this out,

03:07.600 --> 03:13.040
check this out. This is the tweet that really inspired me to do this, to do this video here.

03:13.760 --> 03:18.800
Before you watch it though, check this out. We've got Kamala Harris. Hey, I know that you want to

03:18.800 --> 03:23.440
tweet about Day of the Girl because it's a trending hashtag, but your campaign is failing.

03:23.440 --> 03:29.040
You might as well just give it up. But dude, watch this video from Girls Who Code. Learn to code,

03:29.040 --> 03:35.920
all right? Today is the March for the Sisterhood, the first all-digital march in history created for

03:35.920 --> 03:40.160
girls by Girls Who Code. For the first time ever, you can march from anywhere in the world

03:40.160 --> 03:44.160
to bring awareness to the issues you're passionate about. Join us now. You know,

03:46.320 --> 03:49.200
point of a march is that you actually do it in real life. Like you walk,

03:50.000 --> 03:57.920
you go somewhere. You can't have an all-digital march. That is literally just slacktivism.

03:57.920 --> 04:03.120
It's keyboard activism. That's all it is. It's believing that hashtags and retweets actually

04:03.120 --> 04:04.320
matter.

04:33.360 --> 04:36.320
I march so that women always have the right to choose.

04:42.560 --> 04:49.920
I march for getting up instead of giving up. For a movement that changes lives. I march for me.

04:49.920 --> 05:00.320
For me. I march for her. I march for her. I march for you. I march for you. I march for sisterhood.

05:03.120 --> 05:10.800
I think that might have been the most cancerous thing I've ever seen in my life.

05:10.800 --> 05:14.480
Okay, let's just give us another watch here for a second, all right? Hold on.

05:19.680 --> 05:25.120
First of all, you can't possibly convince me that all these women are coders. There's no fucking

05:25.120 --> 05:34.640
way. I march to take up space. Well, to be fair, I know I'm no one to talk, but this individual

05:34.640 --> 05:41.120
seems to be taking up more than enough space already. At the same time, have you noticed

05:41.120 --> 05:47.680
that does seem to be a talking point of a lot of SJWs, the whole take up space thing? It's like

05:47.680 --> 05:55.040
quite literally just exist and be useless and do nothing, actually taking up space and nothing else.

05:55.680 --> 06:03.040
As if that's a virtue. I march because migration is a human right.

06:03.840 --> 06:08.960
Since fucking when? I know when they're saying this, it shows three women who are all taking

06:08.960 --> 06:14.880
up a lot of space themselves. They're marching and they're migrating from one side of the road

06:14.880 --> 06:26.000
to the other. But migration is a human right? Is it? How much of an upper class bourgeois asshole

06:26.000 --> 06:31.920
do you have to be to think that your ability to go on vacations and migrate around the world and

06:32.560 --> 06:38.480
be a citizen of nowhere, be a true globalist, a true cosmopolitan is a human right? You should

06:38.480 --> 06:42.560
just be able to go wherever you like, stay wherever you like. Screw the laws of countries

06:42.560 --> 06:45.760
that you happen to be going through. Screw the people of those countries. You know what? You

06:45.760 --> 06:52.960
can just migrate wherever you want. No. Jesus. For everyone on a gender journey.

06:54.720 --> 07:05.200
What qualifies as a gender journey? Isn't that every form of life in this? It's like a single

07:05.200 --> 07:11.040
cell organism that has no gender and just splits off and reproduces a sexually. Aren't we all on

07:11.040 --> 07:19.120
a gender journey? What does that mean? What is it? What does any of this mean?

07:20.480 --> 07:27.840
Because equal work means equal pay. You say equal work means equal pay as you show off a woman

07:27.840 --> 07:34.160
who is pregnant and by definition will be doing less than equal work.

07:35.920 --> 07:40.560
I mean, I'm not saying that she shouldn't. I mean, she's pregnant. She has to take time off and

07:41.680 --> 07:47.600
go be a mother and that's fair, but you're still not at your job. Why should you be paid as if you

07:47.600 --> 07:57.920
are? I really got to ask about that African tribal music. I don't know, man. Getting back to Twitter

07:57.920 --> 08:04.960
for a second though, today is day of the girl, which should be every day. Really? Every single

08:04.960 --> 08:10.480
day. I assume you also believe that every single day should be day of the boy then, right?

08:11.280 --> 08:17.520
How come they all say fierce? Fierce. You scroll back up here. There's an anime one up here

08:17.520 --> 08:25.440
and they say the fiercest leading ladies. What is with the word fierce? Oh, yeah. Fruits basket.

08:25.440 --> 08:30.240
Toru Honda from fruits basket. Yeah, I've seen fruits basket. She is the opposite of what I

08:30.240 --> 08:36.960
would call fierce. Girls can do anything they set their mind to. Okay. Inspire, create, lead, resist,

08:36.960 --> 08:41.760
speak, write, discover, descent, soar. I thought this was, first of all,

08:43.600 --> 08:48.240
Justice Ginsburg is looking about 50 years too young for this picture, but in general,

08:48.240 --> 08:54.640
I thought that this was about girls, not women. International Women's Day is a different day, in

08:54.640 --> 09:02.720
fact. Strike. Oh, shit. Is that Greta Thunberg? Is she going on strike again? Hold on, hold on.

09:02.720 --> 09:08.160
Wonder, resist, honor, innovate, love, hope, explore, rebel, imagine, marvel,

09:08.160 --> 09:17.760
believe, learn, work, slay. All right. All right. Sure. It's literally just every single

09:17.760 --> 09:24.000
female protagonist. And at this point they have had to resort to ones that were made up in stories

09:24.000 --> 09:28.480
because I guess there's not enough female historical characters because there's not enough

09:28.720 --> 09:34.000
actual historical people. I don't know. This all girl firefighter team is from a Polish village

09:34.000 --> 09:38.960
where no boys have been born in 10 years. You know, I think that's the plot of a porn. Oh,

09:38.960 --> 09:43.680
the United Nations. Girls are unscripted. Girls are unstoppable. Girls can do anything and

09:43.680 --> 09:50.400
everything. See, as you scroll through here, you notice that a lot of these are obviously quite

09:50.400 --> 09:56.400
positive and I can understand the positive effects that they want to have, but it's good to encourage

09:56.400 --> 10:02.880
and empower everyone, not just one gender of children, especially when one gender of children

10:02.880 --> 10:08.720
and it's not girls are doing worse in school and are in fact becoming more and more withdrawn from

10:08.720 --> 10:13.440
society as they grow into young adults. Overheard my four year old daughter dropping some knowledge

10:13.440 --> 10:17.440
on her two year old baby sister while they were watching last night's town hall. You can be a

10:17.440 --> 10:22.080
congresswoman and a mommy. I'm sure that's what they were saying. I'm sure this wasn't just

10:22.080 --> 10:26.720
opposed picture because you wanted to have a woke child you can put on the internet for points.

10:26.720 --> 10:30.640
In any case, this is all very interesting stuff. You know, girls being empowered,

10:30.640 --> 10:34.160
girls posting on Twitter, girls talking with other girls, girls encouraging each other. You know,

10:34.160 --> 10:40.080
very good. As all of this female centric celebration happens, I guess the men of

10:40.080 --> 10:45.280
society will in fact be not celebrating because they'll be too busy actually keeping things

10:45.280 --> 10:46.480
running.
