WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.060
It's finally time I tackled this subject.

00:08.060 --> 00:11.760
I talked about it briefly on the most recent sip, and realized that I should get my thoughts

00:11.760 --> 00:16.220
on this topic down in some sort of thought-out, pre-scripted, organized way, without garbling

00:16.220 --> 00:18.540
it on stream, because that's how I roll.

00:18.540 --> 00:23.420
So let's finally examine the question, are trans women actually women?

00:23.420 --> 00:28.260
Well, let's focus on the specifics, namely what we mean when we ask the question, are

00:28.260 --> 00:33.580
trans women women, and what lens we're using to try and discover an answer to the question.

00:33.580 --> 00:37.500
Conservatives tend to rely on the intuitive answer here, a simple no, often coupled with

00:37.500 --> 00:39.320
the pithier mark, define woman.

00:39.320 --> 00:43.180
The conservative position here is that woman is defined as adult human female, because

00:43.180 --> 00:46.300
trans women are adult human males, they can't be women.

00:46.300 --> 00:49.200
Conservatives generally leave it here because the logic is compact and punchy.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.540
But let's actually analyze what makes this view operate.

00:52.540 --> 00:56.700
This is where we get to the first lens, the taxonomy view of biological sex.

00:56.700 --> 01:00.340
Taxonomy is the science of classification, how we organize a bunch of separate things

01:00.340 --> 01:01.500
into groups of things.

01:01.500 --> 01:04.020
We use it for libraries, for computers, for finance.

01:04.020 --> 01:08.380
But important to us right now is biological taxonomy, specifically sexual taxonomy.

01:08.380 --> 01:09.940
I'll just cut right to the heart of it.

01:09.940 --> 01:14.160
When it comes to biological life on earth, we identify males as members of a species

01:14.160 --> 01:18.140
that produces small gametes, which is almost always some type of sperm, and we identify

01:18.140 --> 01:21.880
females as members of the species that produces large gametes, which is almost always some

01:21.880 --> 01:22.880
type of egg.

01:22.880 --> 01:26.900
There are some single-celled organisms that reproduce either by cell fission or instead

01:26.900 --> 01:30.880
by swapping gametes, but they're so small that the gametes are the same size, meaning

01:30.880 --> 01:32.860
neither is really male or female.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.200
But those are exceptions.

01:34.200 --> 01:38.180
Once we move beyond primitive cellular life, it's all about gamete sizes.

01:38.180 --> 01:39.180
It's not about chromosomes.

01:39.180 --> 01:41.320
A lot of people like to say it's either XX or XY.

01:41.320 --> 01:45.520
But birds, fish, and snakes all have a ZW chrominal system, and yet they still have

01:45.520 --> 01:46.760
males and females.

01:46.760 --> 01:50.120
Some bugs and bats have an XO system, moths have a ZO system.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.700
The point is that chromosomes aren't enough.

01:51.700 --> 01:55.860
Even in humans, somebody can have abnormal chromosomes and still produce large or small

01:55.860 --> 01:56.860
gametes.

01:56.860 --> 02:00.520
It's not about who has what genitals, it's not about hormones, it's not about who does

02:00.520 --> 02:02.900
the penetrating or who carries the child or who raises.

02:02.900 --> 02:04.860
Throw all that out the window, it's irrelevant.

02:04.860 --> 02:08.400
Sexual taxonomy is determined by the size of the gametes you produce.

02:08.400 --> 02:12.740
Almost every species has males and females corresponding to producing small and large

02:12.740 --> 02:14.160
gametes respectively.

02:14.160 --> 02:18.380
Some species, like earthworms and snails, and a lot of plants, are hermaphroditic, meaning

02:18.380 --> 02:21.620
they produce both small and large gametes at the same time.

02:21.620 --> 02:25.660
In humans, there are intersex people, but it still comes down to what gametes, if any,

02:25.660 --> 02:26.660
they produce.

02:26.660 --> 02:32.380
So far, there's been zero documented cases of any human ever producing both sets of gametes.

02:32.380 --> 02:34.220
With that being said, let's move on.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.940
Consider cattle as a species.

02:35.940 --> 02:39.300
Adult males of the species, meaning cattle that can produce small gametes, are called

02:39.300 --> 02:40.340
bulls.

02:40.340 --> 02:43.380
Adult females, cattle that can produce large gametes, are called cows.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.860
Immature cattle are called calves.

02:44.860 --> 02:48.860
An immature male, meaning a cattle that cannot yet produce small gametes but will once he

02:48.860 --> 02:51.980
matures, is a bull calf, while an immature female is a heifer.

02:51.980 --> 02:53.300
But here's where it gets interesting.

02:53.300 --> 02:57.940
A castrated male, meaning a cattle that could produce small gametes but has a sexual organ

02:57.940 --> 02:59.860
surgically removed, is an ox.

02:59.860 --> 03:02.900
Oxen are preferable for labor over bulls, being easier to control.

03:02.900 --> 03:07.020
You'll find a similar naming convention among a lot of animal species, at least in English.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.020
Here's another quick example.

03:08.020 --> 03:10.860
For deer, adult males are bucks or stags, depending on the species.

03:10.860 --> 03:12.500
Adult females are generally does.

03:12.500 --> 03:15.540
Children are generally fawns or kids, depending on species and gender.

03:15.540 --> 03:17.540
A sterilized deer is a Javier.

03:17.540 --> 03:21.800
Natural taxonomy commonly breaks out into these five classifications, all revolving

03:21.800 --> 03:23.160
around gamete production.

03:23.160 --> 03:27.020
Immature male, immature female, mature male, mature female, and neuter.

03:27.020 --> 03:30.460
In a taxonomic sense, there's no reason that humans would be different than any other

03:30.460 --> 03:31.520
animal on Earth.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.940
We have children who cannot yet produce gametes but will, boys and girls.

03:34.940 --> 03:37.300
We have adults who do produce gametes, men and women.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.180
And we have people who can't produce gametes anymore, eunuchs.

03:40.180 --> 03:44.820
This schema also applies to intersex and trans people, based on if they produce large gametes,

03:44.820 --> 03:46.940
small gametes, or no gametes.

03:46.940 --> 03:50.980
So if we're examining the question of, are trans women actually women, through the lens

03:50.980 --> 03:54.020
of human sexual taxonomy, the answer is no.

03:54.020 --> 03:56.420
They might produce small gametes, making them men.

03:56.420 --> 03:59.020
They might produce no gametes, making them eunuchs.

03:59.020 --> 04:02.620
But until we're living in the transhumanist future, where trans women can have a fully

04:02.620 --> 04:07.260
functioning uterus and ovaries transplanted into them, they can never produce large gametes,

04:07.260 --> 04:08.780
meaning they can never be women.

04:08.780 --> 04:10.720
But to some, this is an offensive answer.

04:10.720 --> 04:11.720
Humans aren't like animals.

04:11.720 --> 04:15.180
We can't use biological sexual classification standards on us, the same way that we use

04:15.180 --> 04:16.180
them on every other species.

04:16.180 --> 04:18.420
For people, okay, fair enough.

04:18.420 --> 04:22.140
There are other lenses beyond the taxonomy one that are worth considering.

04:22.140 --> 04:24.660
Another widely held lens is the social role view.

04:24.660 --> 04:28.220
The idea here is that a woman is a person who takes on a socially feminine function,

04:28.220 --> 04:31.900
or behaves and presents in a socially feminine manner, or is treated by others in a feminine

04:31.900 --> 04:32.900
way.

04:32.900 --> 04:36.860
Okay, on this surface, this seems like a fine trans inclusive lens to view the problem with.

04:36.860 --> 04:41.220
And there are at least a few pro-trans feminists over the years who have agreed with this view.

04:41.220 --> 04:43.780
But the more we dig into it, the more problems we begin to unearth.

04:43.780 --> 04:48.340
Firstly, what do we mean by taking on a socially feminine function or behaving and presenting

04:48.340 --> 04:49.860
in a socially feminine manner?

04:49.860 --> 04:53.780
It's very tough to define what this means in any sort of universal way, like the taxonomy

04:53.780 --> 04:57.600
view manages to, especially considering differences in the feminine gender role across culture

04:57.600 --> 04:58.600
and time.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.900
But let's just hand wave that and say, you know, whatever passes for feminine right now

05:01.900 --> 05:03.300
in our culture or something.

05:03.300 --> 05:06.620
Let's say that we've discovered the universal feminine gender role.

05:06.620 --> 05:10.100
There's still a problem here though, and that has to do with the framing of the question.

05:10.100 --> 05:13.500
When a progressive is seeking for the answer to the question, are trans women actually

05:13.500 --> 05:14.500
women?

05:14.500 --> 05:17.460
What they're actually looking for is an answer to the question, are all trans women

05:17.460 --> 05:18.460
women?

05:18.460 --> 05:21.700
Meaning more specifically, they are seeking a definition of woman that includes all cis

05:21.700 --> 05:25.580
women and all trans women, but no cis men or trans men.

05:25.580 --> 05:28.780
That is what they require in their fully inclusive definition.

05:28.780 --> 05:30.940
Not a single trans woman is left behind.

05:30.940 --> 05:34.320
Does the social role view provide the answer the Prague is looking for?

05:34.320 --> 05:36.060
Unfortunately for them, no.

05:36.060 --> 05:40.380
Regardless of what social role we pin down and say, this is the social role you can adopt

05:40.380 --> 05:41.380
to become a woman.

05:41.380 --> 05:44.740
It still doesn't include all trans women and exclude all men.

05:44.740 --> 05:48.500
There are absolutely extremely submissive men who would take on this feminine gender

05:48.500 --> 05:49.500
role.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.500
They might even call themselves girl.

05:50.500 --> 05:54.660
That's a thing in the gay community for sure, but they don't actually consider themselves

05:54.660 --> 05:55.660
women.

05:55.660 --> 05:59.780
In the same vein, there are absolutely trans women who would not adopt this gender role.

05:59.780 --> 06:02.820
Maybe because they're not out of the closet yet, maybe it's because they don't pass

06:02.820 --> 06:04.100
or they never will pass.

06:04.100 --> 06:08.580
Hell, there's both trans women and cis women who are very masculine presenting, the

06:08.580 --> 06:12.420
butch lesbian types, and they might say things like, women don't owe you femininity.

06:12.420 --> 06:14.740
That's a pretty common feminist sentiment, in fact.

06:14.740 --> 06:19.180
The problem with the social role view is that trans women who don't perform the role would

06:19.180 --> 06:24.220
not be considered women, while men who do perform the role would be forced to be women,

06:24.220 --> 06:26.560
and the Progs can't stand for that.

06:26.560 --> 06:31.040
Some of the more radical activists on the left, both trans and not, have adopted the

06:31.040 --> 06:33.500
gender abolitionist lens on the topic.

06:33.500 --> 06:36.540
For these people, they want to abolish the concept of gender itself.

06:36.540 --> 06:39.380
In their ideal world, there is no more man or woman.

06:39.380 --> 06:40.760
Gender is a dead concept.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.100
Nobody knows what it means anymore.

06:42.100 --> 06:45.300
Nobody has the language to describe a difference between a man and a woman.

06:45.300 --> 06:47.220
Nobody can recognize the difference between men and women.

06:47.220 --> 06:51.140
The human race is all just made up of people who look different from each other.

06:51.140 --> 06:55.660
In this view, definitionally, no trans woman can be women, because there are no women anymore.

06:55.660 --> 06:59.940
There are no trans women anymore, too, ignoring the stupidity of this position.

06:59.940 --> 07:04.020
Even if we take it at face value, the progressives' quest to find a definition of woman that includes

07:04.020 --> 07:08.340
all trans women is not fulfilled here, because this framework doesn't have a definition

07:08.340 --> 07:09.420
of woman at all.

07:09.420 --> 07:13.920
It honestly becomes truly incredible to watch a trans woman take this position in real time,

07:13.920 --> 07:17.900
because it's in complete conflict with the view that nobody is ever socially conditioned

07:17.900 --> 07:18.900
into being trans.

07:18.900 --> 07:22.420
That's all just conservatives basically calling people groomers.

07:22.420 --> 07:26.460
Except by the abolitionists' own logic, everybody is socially conditioned into being

07:26.460 --> 07:27.460
trans.

07:27.460 --> 07:28.820
There's also the prescriptive lens.

07:28.820 --> 07:32.360
Within this framework, the question is reframed as an affirmative statement.

07:32.360 --> 07:35.440
Trans women are women isn't a description of reality, but a prescription of what we

07:35.440 --> 07:36.680
want reality to be.

07:36.680 --> 07:39.600
Kinda like people who hold up signs saying healthcare is a human right.

07:39.600 --> 07:43.400
Within a natural rights framework, healthcare is not a right, but even ignoring that, even

07:43.400 --> 07:45.280
taking the view that rights flow from the state.

07:45.280 --> 07:48.540
In a state where healthcare isn't a right, the statement healthcare is a human right

07:48.540 --> 07:49.720
is definitionally false.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.280
But they're using it as a prescription, not a description.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.540
And the same goes for trans women are women here.

07:54.540 --> 07:57.820
In essence, what they're saying is trans women should be women.

07:57.820 --> 08:01.480
The argument for this is ultimately going to be based in utility, in good consequences.

08:01.480 --> 08:05.640
That society is better off if trans women are women than if trans women aren't women.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.080
So trans women should be women.

08:07.080 --> 08:10.920
We're going to have to dive into the postmodernist commie gobbledygook, but let's actually

08:10.920 --> 08:12.140
consider this logic.

08:12.140 --> 08:17.000
The postmodernists are correct when they say that our language is as it is because it serves

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
some function.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.840
I think it was the father of postmodernism, the French philosopher Derrida, who described

08:21.840 --> 08:25.520
language as a series of rafts in the ocean that we never actually leave to get to shore.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.300
I don't know, I haven't read this guy's stuff since university.

08:28.300 --> 08:32.440
The postmodernists are correct when they say that our language is as it is, not because

08:32.440 --> 08:35.880
it's immutable, but because it serves some utility to us.

08:35.880 --> 08:40.600
For example, when I say the word water, there's three separate things wrapped up in there.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.400
There's the word water, which is itself meaningless, it's just a word.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.920
A person who doesn't know my language, who hears me say water, is just going to hear

08:46.920 --> 08:47.920
random sounds.

08:47.920 --> 08:51.260
Then there's the concept of water, which is what I'm thinking of in my head when I

08:51.260 --> 08:52.260
say water.

08:52.260 --> 08:56.040
And when I say to you, this is water, I'm hoping you have the same concept in your head

08:56.040 --> 08:59.740
of water that I do, so that I'm conveying to you not just the sound of the word, but

08:59.740 --> 09:01.300
the meaning that I intend.

09:01.300 --> 09:06.240
And then there's actually the physical substance that is water, the clear, tasteless, odorless

09:06.240 --> 09:09.540
liquid that is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

09:09.540 --> 09:13.560
That substance, the substance of water, I can never truly get to it with language alone.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.900
I just described it to you there, but it's not like water poured over your headphones

09:16.900 --> 09:17.900
or something.

09:17.900 --> 09:22.060
Description of the thing is not the thing itself, and the only way to know water is

09:22.060 --> 09:24.380
to experience water beyond language.

09:24.380 --> 09:28.840
There are even some more hardcore postmodernists called anti-realists who think that it's

09:28.840 --> 09:32.520
impossible to know water even if you touch it or taste it because your senses are still

09:32.520 --> 09:36.320
subjective and a product of your own mind, and that there's no real world beyond human

09:36.320 --> 09:37.320
perception.

09:37.320 --> 09:39.800
But if you're going to go down the ultimate skeptic rabbit hole, all of reality breaks

09:39.800 --> 09:43.200
down and it's honestly pretty retarded because nobody actually lives their life that way.

09:43.200 --> 09:47.640
In my opinion, there does seem to be a world beyond human perception of it, and words can

09:47.640 --> 09:50.040
convey meaning without truly knowing that world.

09:50.040 --> 09:53.680
We called water, water, long before we knew what hydrogen and oxygen was.

09:53.680 --> 09:57.380
And yet, the meaning remained even as we learned more about what it was.

09:57.380 --> 10:00.620
Sometimes meanings change with new knowledge, but nonetheless it does seem to be the case

10:00.620 --> 10:04.900
that a lot of language does at least point to something real even if it's not the thing

10:04.900 --> 10:05.900
itself.

10:05.900 --> 10:10.040
So, the prescriptive view of gender is, if all of language is this postmodernist series

10:10.040 --> 10:14.060
of rafts, and we construct it all to point at real world phenomenon in a way that is

10:14.060 --> 10:18.220
useful to us, then we should construct woman to include transwoman.

10:18.220 --> 10:20.500
The issue is that useful for us part.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.520
The taxonomy view that we discussed back at the start of the video is actually the

10:23.520 --> 10:26.220
natural end result of this prescriptivist view.

10:26.220 --> 10:30.360
We find it useful to classify different types of a species by their reproductive capability,

10:30.360 --> 10:32.940
and man and woman for humans is no different.

10:32.940 --> 10:36.420
Most men, when they say that they are romantically attracted to women, they have packed into

10:36.420 --> 10:41.280
that label, biologically female, capable of having heterosexual sex, capable of carrying

10:41.280 --> 10:43.600
children, and transwomen can't do any of that.

10:43.600 --> 10:47.560
The common Prague reply at this point is, would you say that a woman who can't carry

10:47.560 --> 10:48.800
children isn't a woman?

10:48.800 --> 10:52.640
The truth is, believe it or not, a lot of people, both men and women, do consider that

10:52.640 --> 10:53.640
to be the case.

10:53.640 --> 10:57.120
Like, it sucks, it's a shitty reality, I'm sure it's offensive to many people.

10:57.120 --> 11:02.120
But the human taxonomy view views these people as neuter, and for most of human history we've

11:02.120 --> 11:03.300
had no problem saying it.

11:03.300 --> 11:07.160
And this is where the social engineering part of the conversation comes into play.

11:07.160 --> 11:11.820
If leftoids can push the culture into a position where most people no longer find utility in

11:11.820 --> 11:17.060
using gender in this way, then the prescriptive view of gender would necessarily desync with

11:17.060 --> 11:18.060
the taxonomic view.

11:18.060 --> 11:21.740
That's why it's prescriptive, it's saying we should do this, it's a moral statement,

11:21.740 --> 11:22.860
not a statement of fact.

11:22.860 --> 11:26.500
But that's a problem for the Prague if we're talking about the question, are transwomen

11:26.500 --> 11:27.500
actually women?

11:27.500 --> 11:31.180
The prescriptive answer is, they're not, and they should be, but that's still a no.

11:31.180 --> 11:35.260
And it always will be until we reach a point that the majority culture no longer cares

11:35.260 --> 11:37.540
about biological sex when it comes to finding a partner.

11:37.540 --> 11:39.540
And frankly I wouldn't hold my breath on that one.

11:39.540 --> 11:43.380
So, when the progressive seeks to find a definition of woman that includes all transwomen, while

11:43.380 --> 11:45.940
excluding all men, nothing seems to fit.

11:45.940 --> 11:47.780
The taxonomy view says that none of them are.

11:47.780 --> 11:51.500
The social role view includes some trans women, but not all of them, and it includes some

11:51.500 --> 11:52.500
men too.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.340
The abolitionist view says no because there are no women at all.

11:55.340 --> 11:59.220
The prescriptive view also says no, but it focuses on what should be, rather than what

11:59.220 --> 12:00.460
the truth actually is.

12:00.460 --> 12:04.420
It's at this point the progressive falls into the ultimately arbitrary position that

12:04.420 --> 12:08.820
is necessarily the end result of the social engineering deep within the prescriptive view,

12:08.820 --> 12:10.980
the self-identification lens.

12:10.980 --> 12:15.020
Most people who consider the prescriptive view end up abandoning utility once they recognize

12:15.020 --> 12:19.860
that most people actually find a lot of utility in differentiation based on reproductive ability,

12:19.860 --> 12:22.580
so they abandon utility in favor of harm reduction.

12:22.580 --> 12:26.060
At this point it doesn't matter what the objective truth is, or if it even exists.

12:26.060 --> 12:28.920
It doesn't matter if some people prefer the current definitions.

12:28.920 --> 12:32.760
If we are the ones that can choose what all this shit means, we should just open the doors

12:32.760 --> 12:37.060
and let everybody identify as what they want to minimize the harm that comes with gatekeeping.

12:37.060 --> 12:41.820
Therefore the self-ID lens is one where anybody who self-identifies as a woman is a woman.

12:41.820 --> 12:44.780
There are no qualifiers other than identification.

12:44.780 --> 12:48.580
On the surface, it seems like the question, are trans women actually women, is definitionally

12:48.580 --> 12:49.580
true now.

12:49.580 --> 12:51.900
They are women because we've defined them as women, and if there are any trans women

12:51.900 --> 12:55.340
out there who don't make the cut by some other metric, don't worry about it, because

12:55.340 --> 12:59.380
we've completely unmoored the concept of woman from any measurable metric.

12:59.380 --> 13:03.780
It's simply a class that you can belong to by virtue of identifying as belonging to it.

13:03.780 --> 13:07.140
Now a conservative would immediately say, this is a circular definition.

13:07.140 --> 13:08.140
You see this a lot.

13:08.140 --> 13:09.140
Define woman.

13:09.140 --> 13:10.140
Anyone who identifies as a woman.

13:10.140 --> 13:11.140
You can't use the word in its own definition.

13:11.140 --> 13:12.140
That's circular.

13:12.140 --> 13:13.140
And this is true.

13:14.020 --> 13:21.220
The definition of woman is a person that identifies as such.

13:21.220 --> 13:24.260
What does such refer to here in your sentence, you brainlet?

13:24.260 --> 13:25.820
You haven't actually changed anything.

13:25.820 --> 13:29.140
You've just subbed out woman for a variable that directly means a woman and brings nothing

13:29.140 --> 13:30.140
else to the table.

13:30.140 --> 13:31.140
It's still circular.

13:31.140 --> 13:32.220
You're just too dumb to recognize it.

13:32.220 --> 13:36.060
But often the conservative stops thinking here and says, aha, I'm correct.

13:36.060 --> 13:38.220
It is circular, but let's keep going.

13:38.220 --> 13:40.940
Let's examine exactly what the problem is.

13:40.940 --> 13:44.660
These issues are deliberately ignorant to the point that they're not capable of talking

13:44.660 --> 13:46.400
about any of these issues.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.700
Can you go over circular arguments like real quick?

13:48.700 --> 13:49.700
There's no such thing.

13:49.700 --> 13:53.100
Guys, there is no reason a definition can't be circular.

13:53.100 --> 13:57.340
Not that my definition of woman is, but it doesn't have to be people like people start

13:57.340 --> 14:01.220
pretending there were all these like rules about what a definition can be.

14:01.220 --> 14:04.100
There aren't words can mean literally anything.

14:04.100 --> 14:09.220
The reason we choose definitions and use them is to serve utility, but they never get to

14:09.220 --> 14:10.220
that point.

14:10.380 --> 14:13.020
I wish I could get to that point in an argument with a conservative.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.300
I'm sure Vosch considers me a conservative.

14:15.300 --> 14:18.700
And for your sake, buddy, because I like you a lot, I am happy to directly engage with

14:18.700 --> 14:19.700
your question.

14:19.700 --> 14:20.920
He's partially correct.

14:20.920 --> 14:24.560
This is Derrida's observation of language being a series of raffs again.

14:24.560 --> 14:28.780
But on the other hand, you can de tallo the neutalov until it reached Parkst, then keep

14:28.780 --> 14:31.040
the part that was both Tenir and Hoch.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.820
Is the ton woe Roy or Beccafroy?

14:33.820 --> 14:34.860
What did I just ask you there?

14:34.860 --> 14:37.080
What meaning did I just convey to you?

14:37.080 --> 14:41.620
Language can mean anything, but it does have to mean something that we all agree upon in

14:41.620 --> 14:42.620
order to be useful.

14:42.620 --> 14:46.100
Otherwise, it's just individuals using their own private languages that aren't actually

14:46.100 --> 14:47.840
communicating any meaning.

14:47.840 --> 14:48.840
Here's the thing.

14:48.840 --> 14:52.400
Any highly complicated class that involves multiple traits is actually really hard to

14:52.400 --> 14:53.400
define.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.400
For example, what's a chair?

14:54.400 --> 14:56.600
Four legs with a seat in the back that people sit on?

14:56.600 --> 14:58.400
I mean, yeah, but that's also a horse.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.400
What's a car?

14:59.400 --> 15:00.400
Something with wheels?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.400
Is a truck a car?

15:01.400 --> 15:02.400
Maybe.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.400
Is a motorcycle a car?

15:03.400 --> 15:05.520
Well, if it needs more than two wheels, how about a motorcycle with a sidecar?

15:05.960 --> 15:06.960
How about a car with three wheels?

15:06.960 --> 15:08.880
How about a broken car with no wheels?

15:08.880 --> 15:11.020
If it needs an engine, is a lawnmower a car?

15:11.020 --> 15:13.720
If it needs to run on gas, is an electric car a car?

15:13.720 --> 15:16.600
If an electric car actually is a car, is a golf cart a car?

15:16.600 --> 15:21.480
Every single definition for every classification has fuzzy edges, and frankly, gender, even

15:21.480 --> 15:23.460
sex is no different.

15:23.460 --> 15:26.560
Male and female are still categories that we made up.

15:26.560 --> 15:30.880
It's not like the word male or female is printed on our cells if you zoom in with a microscope.

15:30.880 --> 15:35.380
XX and XY might be there, sure, but again, it's possible for an XX person to produce

15:35.380 --> 15:38.980
small gametes, even though the overwhelming majority of them produce large gametes, and

15:38.980 --> 15:40.460
vice versa for an XY.

15:40.460 --> 15:44.360
We notice that organisms produce small gametes, large gametes, or no gametes, but we still

15:44.360 --> 15:48.660
choose to use that as a basis for our classification of male, female, and neuter.

15:48.660 --> 15:51.880
When we're talking about man and woman, we notice a collection of traits.

15:51.880 --> 15:55.720
We notice that they largely fit into two groups, and we notice that identifying those groups

15:55.720 --> 15:58.660
as two separate things brings us utility.

15:58.660 --> 16:01.440
Consider type 2 diabetes, you know, the type that I probably have.

16:01.440 --> 16:05.020
It's ultimately arbitrary that we choose a certain amount of insulin resistance to

16:05.020 --> 16:08.520
qualify for diabetic, prediabetic, and not diabetic at all.

16:08.520 --> 16:11.680
It could have been a few percentage points different either way, but nonetheless, the

16:11.680 --> 16:16.800
label of diabetic obviously brings us some utility, and it does point at something real,

16:16.800 --> 16:19.400
even if its barriers are constructed by us.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.800
This is the deep problem with Vosch's position.

16:21.800 --> 16:26.120
He says that everything is just a social construct, and that's true, but then he says that because

16:26.120 --> 16:29.440
everything is a social construct, therefore we can just make everything the way we want

16:29.440 --> 16:31.200
it to be, and that is false.

16:31.200 --> 16:36.080
One, it requires broad consensus to truly change the meaning of language, not just bullying

16:36.080 --> 16:39.040
a dictionary into compliance by ratioing them on Twitter.

16:39.040 --> 16:44.080
And two, we have the language that we do because that language points at something in reality.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.380
It is constructed, but it's not really arbitrary.

16:46.380 --> 16:51.120
It's the result of our observations of the world, and even if we do observe edge cases,

16:51.120 --> 16:52.560
exceptions generally prove the rule.

16:52.560 --> 16:56.440
Additionally, when we're talking about gender and sex, the edge cases aren't trans people,

16:56.440 --> 17:00.400
they're intersex people, and it's frankly annoying when trans activists coop intersex

17:00.400 --> 17:02.760
talking points to try and legitimize their views.

17:02.760 --> 17:08.120
So, when Vosch says there's no reason definitions can't be circular, he's referring to Derrida's

17:08.120 --> 17:09.120
rafts.

17:09.120 --> 17:10.120
And fair enough.

17:10.120 --> 17:12.440
If you dig deep enough, all definitions are circular.

17:12.440 --> 17:16.080
Quick example, in the Oxford Dictionary, what is a woman, an adult female human being?

17:16.080 --> 17:17.080
What's a female?

17:17.080 --> 17:20.860
Of or denoting the sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs, distinguished biologically

17:20.860 --> 17:22.880
by the production of large gametes.

17:22.880 --> 17:26.440
What's a gamete, a male or female cell that joins with the cell of the opposite sex to

17:26.440 --> 17:27.440
form a zygote?

17:27.440 --> 17:29.120
Well, we've circled back around a female again.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.120
What's a zygote?

17:30.120 --> 17:33.400
A cell that develops into a person or an animal, formed by the joining together of a male and

17:33.400 --> 17:34.400
female gamete.

17:34.400 --> 17:38.400
It's very common to find definitions that circle back in on themselves in a few steps.

17:38.400 --> 17:43.360
The issue is whether or not the interlocking web of circular references ever actually communicates

17:43.360 --> 17:45.680
any meaning through the act of referencing.

17:45.680 --> 17:46.680
Here's what I mean.

17:46.680 --> 17:50.380
Let's say that you've never felt the softness of a newborn baby's skin.

17:50.380 --> 17:51.380
I haven't.

17:51.380 --> 17:52.380
I've heard it soft.

17:52.380 --> 17:55.240
So, because I've never felt it, when you tell me that it feels soft, that doesn't

17:55.240 --> 17:56.240
really help me too much.

17:56.240 --> 18:00.920
It might help me a bit if I know what soft is, but I have no idea how soft it is.

18:00.920 --> 18:05.440
But if you were to tell me, it's softer than silk, because I know how soft silk feels.

18:05.440 --> 18:08.180
I am now a lot closer at understanding what you're saying.

18:08.180 --> 18:12.520
This idea is probably best described in Frank Jackson's thought experiment, Mary's Room,

18:12.520 --> 18:16.820
where Mary is a scientist who has lived her entire life in a black and white room.

18:16.820 --> 18:20.440
During that time, she studied everything there is to know about the color red, all scientific

18:20.440 --> 18:25.040
data anyone's ever written about, all descriptions in prose, everything humanity's ever documented

18:25.040 --> 18:26.200
about the color red.

18:26.200 --> 18:30.440
She's even seen black and white pictures and video of everything that's ever existed,

18:30.440 --> 18:33.120
but she's never seen the color red herself.

18:33.120 --> 18:37.320
When Mary leaves the black and white room and sees the color red for the first time,

18:37.320 --> 18:42.520
does that experience, experiencing what red actually looks like, constitute new knowledge?

18:42.520 --> 18:44.000
To me, the answer seems to be yes.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.920
The experience of red itself cannot be rationalistically described, but it's still a form of knowledge

18:48.920 --> 18:52.480
missing in the verbal and written descriptions of what red is.

18:52.480 --> 18:56.680
The point of the Mary's Room thought experiment is that experience is a form of knowledge

18:56.680 --> 19:01.020
that you can't directly get at through language, but language combined with experience can

19:01.020 --> 19:04.220
lead to new knowledge on the edges of your understanding.

19:04.220 --> 19:06.480
That's the softer than silk comment from earlier.

19:06.480 --> 19:10.860
Somebody like Mary with all of her rational knowledge, after experiencing the colors red

19:10.860 --> 19:15.580
and blue for herself, might be able to say red is like blue, but it has these differences.

19:15.580 --> 19:19.800
Her ability to describe those differences are fleshed out by her rational knowledge,

19:19.800 --> 19:23.200
but the experience of seeing them forms the foundation.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.920
Putting it simply, although Derrida is correct that we never leave the rafts of language,

19:26.920 --> 19:29.680
that doesn't mean that we're not in sight of the shoreline.

19:29.680 --> 19:34.120
Language is circular, but it's the web of references combined with our own experience

19:34.120 --> 19:36.280
that allows us to express meaning.

19:36.280 --> 19:39.600
So when Vosch says something like, it doesn't matter if it's circular, anything can be

19:39.600 --> 19:44.440
anything, and we're going down the self-ID rabbit hole where the word woman has no qualifiers

19:44.440 --> 19:48.300
attached, no experience in the real world is necessary to provide the foundation for

19:48.300 --> 19:49.560
knowledge to exist.

19:49.560 --> 19:51.120
What does woman mean?

19:51.120 --> 19:52.520
It seems to be an empty word.

19:52.520 --> 19:56.540
Maybe that's why the UN defines woman as limitless and formless, but that also means

19:56.540 --> 19:59.900
that no meaning is communicated when you say the word woman.

19:59.900 --> 20:03.260
If we're going by this standard, the word woman means nothing at all, and if it's

20:03.260 --> 20:08.480
a word without meaning, then everything and anything and nothing can be a woman, or not

20:08.480 --> 20:09.480
be.

20:09.480 --> 20:12.400
The progressive search for a definition of woman that includes all trans women but no

20:12.400 --> 20:17.340
men necessarily falls apart here, because everything, including men, are simultaneously

20:17.340 --> 20:18.800
women and not women.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.560
But let's continue down the rabbit hole anyway, just in case you're not convinced

20:21.560 --> 20:22.560
yet.

20:22.560 --> 20:24.520
Let's say that on my desk I have all sorts of knick-knacks.

20:24.520 --> 20:29.200
My wallet, my phone, my headphones, books, pens, old receipts, Funko Pop statues, you

20:29.200 --> 20:30.700
know, random assorted junk.

20:30.700 --> 20:35.000
And now let's say that I tell you on my desk I have an object known as a blarg.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.200
Blargs are only identified by one feature, that is, the feature of being a blarg.

20:38.200 --> 20:41.840
I can't tell you anything else about what a blarg is, it has no other qualifiers.

20:41.840 --> 20:46.040
With only what I've told you, can you pick out which object on my desk is a blarg?

20:46.040 --> 20:49.600
The answer is no, because the word blarg conveys no meaning.

20:49.600 --> 20:53.800
That is the problem with circular definitions, that are immediately circular, in zero steps.

20:53.800 --> 20:58.380
It's that they relate back to no other experiences through the web of reference, and therefore

20:58.380 --> 20:59.960
they provide no meaning.

20:59.960 --> 21:03.060
So consider the statement, a woman is anybody who identifies as a woman.

21:03.060 --> 21:06.280
If we were to sub out the second instance of woman there, we would get the statement,

21:06.280 --> 21:09.220
a woman is anybody who identifies as identifying as a woman.

21:09.220 --> 21:12.280
And then if we were to do another round of recursion, it would be, a woman is anybody

21:12.280 --> 21:15.040
who identifies as identifying as identifying as a woman.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.780
And this definition recurses infinitely, never getting to a point where it references

21:18.780 --> 21:22.200
an experience, and therefore never actually containing any knowledge.

21:22.200 --> 21:25.140
Moreover, in the real world, people don't actually do this.

21:25.140 --> 21:28.840
A woman might be somebody who identifies as a woman, sure, but does she identify as identifying

21:28.840 --> 21:29.840
as a woman?

21:29.840 --> 21:32.180
Does she identify as identifying as identifying as a woman?

21:32.180 --> 21:33.640
It simply becomes absurd.

21:33.640 --> 21:36.640
Nobody does this, and so nobody is a woman, including trans women.

21:36.640 --> 21:40.920
The common prague objection to this logic, simply falls back on Derrida's rafts of language.

21:40.920 --> 21:44.160
That it's all constructed, and nothing ever gets back to anything other than words, but

21:44.160 --> 21:48.080
that's because these people are so ideologically captured by postmodernism that they reject

21:48.080 --> 21:52.500
the idea that meaning in language comes from the web of references that appeals to experiences

21:52.500 --> 21:56.160
outside of the language itself, because they reject experience itself.

21:56.160 --> 21:58.320
That's a whole can of worms I'm not going to go down right now.

21:58.320 --> 22:03.000
If you want a taste of it though, sit back and notice just how many leftoids reject experience

22:03.000 --> 22:07.820
a priori in favor of rationalistic planning in work, in school, in politics.

22:07.820 --> 22:12.700
The broader left is rife with the view that having a good idea is more important than

22:12.700 --> 22:14.260
executing good action.

22:14.260 --> 22:16.780
But we can go even deeper.

22:16.780 --> 22:20.500
It's not enough that the phrase, a woman is anybody who identifies as a woman, is circular

22:20.500 --> 22:22.220
and therefore conveys no meaning.

22:22.220 --> 22:26.420
It's not enough that attempting to find meaning in that circularity anyway results in an infinite

22:26.420 --> 22:29.700
number of identifications that no candidate for womanhood would ever perform.

22:29.700 --> 22:34.360
It's also that the logic itself, ignoring the circularity, is still wrong.

22:34.360 --> 22:35.820
Consider the blarg on my desk again.

22:35.820 --> 22:40.020
What kind of object could it possibly be, having only one quality, that of being a blarg?

22:40.020 --> 22:42.980
What quality could possibly exist that fulfills that logic?

22:42.980 --> 22:45.040
Put other qualities into the equation and see what I mean.

22:45.040 --> 22:47.340
A tall person is anyone who identifies as being tall.

22:47.340 --> 22:48.640
Well, that's obviously false.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.620
You can be tall without identifying as being tall.

22:50.620 --> 22:52.380
You can identify as being tall without being tall.

22:52.380 --> 22:53.660
What about being a gamer?

22:53.660 --> 22:55.740
You can be a gamer without identifying as being a gamer.

22:55.740 --> 22:58.940
Then there's a person who plays video games but rejects the identity of gamer while frankly

22:58.940 --> 22:59.940
still having it.

22:59.940 --> 23:01.540
You can identify as being a gamer without being one.

23:01.540 --> 23:04.060
This is the fake gamer girl who doesn't actually play games, for example.

23:04.060 --> 23:08.060
I can be somebody who has cancer but not identify as having cancer because it's undiagnosed.

23:08.100 --> 23:12.060
Conversely, I can identify as having cancer but not actually have cancer because I'm

23:12.060 --> 23:13.060
a hypochondriac.

23:13.060 --> 23:19.100
It is universal that being a thing and identifying as being a thing are not linked concepts.

23:19.100 --> 23:23.020
Because being a thing refers back to some sort of experience-based referential knowledge

23:23.020 --> 23:27.740
while identifying as being a thing is a product entirely of your own self-perception.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.380
And that perception can be wrong.

23:29.380 --> 23:32.140
Let's say that your parents told you you were born in Toronto.

23:32.140 --> 23:34.500
As such, you identify as somebody born in Toronto.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.780
But it turns out your parents lied.

23:35.780 --> 23:37.020
You were actually born in Ottawa.

23:37.020 --> 23:41.180
You may self-idea somebody born in Toronto but that self-idea is incorrect.

23:41.180 --> 23:44.820
It doesn't map onto the real-world experience of what your life actually is.

23:44.820 --> 23:49.060
The logic behind a woman is anybody who identifies as a woman is still wrong, independent of

23:49.060 --> 23:51.180
any sort of circular definition problem.

23:51.180 --> 23:55.500
Because what you identify as could be incorrect and it's impossible to have a quality that

23:55.500 --> 23:58.060
exists only if you identify as having it.

23:58.060 --> 24:02.060
Consider any other sort of emotion-based choice instead of identify and you'll see the same

24:02.060 --> 24:03.260
problems pop up.

24:03.260 --> 24:05.100
Like consider desiring instead.

24:05.100 --> 24:06.900
Are you tall if you desire to be tall?

24:06.900 --> 24:07.780
Obviously not.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.020
Are you an athlete if you desire to be an athlete?

24:10.020 --> 24:13.740
Though I will make note here that a lot of motivational inspirational perspectives put

24:13.740 --> 24:16.060
forward the idea that you are the thing you desire.

24:16.060 --> 24:19.980
Not because you actually are but because thinking you are is part of the mind state that helps

24:19.980 --> 24:21.220
you accomplish the goal.

24:21.220 --> 24:23.900
So you're not actually a professional basketball player.

24:23.900 --> 24:27.540
But if you keep the identity of professional basketball player in your mind it may become

24:27.540 --> 24:31.400
easier to do the day-to-day grind of actually becoming a professional basketball player.

24:31.400 --> 24:34.900
Same with telling yourself I'm an artist to motivate yourself to create art.

24:34.900 --> 24:38.980
The language of the fake it until you make it mentality directly mimics the I am what

24:38.980 --> 24:41.100
I identify as attitude in the trans conversation.

24:41.100 --> 24:45.180
But only to streamline the process of performing the real world behaviors that will actually

24:45.180 --> 24:48.180
transform you into the thing that you're claiming to be.

24:48.180 --> 24:50.820
Trans activists don't use the language in this way.

24:50.820 --> 24:55.420
All that being said we're still talking about the progressives question of are all trans

24:55.420 --> 24:56.740
women actually women?

24:56.740 --> 25:00.380
And the self ID view fails that question spectacularly.

25:00.380 --> 25:03.220
At first glance it seems to answer the question the way the progs want.

25:03.220 --> 25:06.780
But as soon as you actually engage your brain and think about it even a little bit the logic

25:06.780 --> 25:07.980
completely falls apart.

25:07.980 --> 25:11.300
Some people will feel the need to hand wave all these objections away saying it doesn't

25:11.300 --> 25:15.060
matter if the logic doesn't work trans women are women and whoever identifies as a woman

25:15.060 --> 25:16.060
is one.

25:16.060 --> 25:17.060
But that's just special pleading.

25:17.060 --> 25:21.780
What they're really saying is I'm a-okay with this one specific domain being a place where

25:21.780 --> 25:25.980
none of the rules of logic or language or meaning actually apply as long as it gets

25:25.980 --> 25:27.960
me my desired political outcome.

25:27.960 --> 25:31.820
Which is an attitude that is frankly directly in opposition to the pursuit of knowledge.

25:31.820 --> 25:36.100
So finally here we are at the end of the progressive analysis on this question with

25:36.100 --> 25:39.220
no answers that will ever actually satisfy the progressive.

25:39.220 --> 25:43.800
In the taxonomic view no trans women are women because they will never produce large gametes.

25:43.800 --> 25:47.940
In the social role view some trans women are women and some aren't while some men are also

25:47.940 --> 25:48.940
women.

25:48.940 --> 25:52.460
In the abolitionist view no trans women are women because women as a category and trans

25:52.460 --> 25:54.120
women as a category don't exist.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.560
In the prescriptive view the statement is trans women should be women but there's no

25:57.560 --> 25:59.960
claim of whether or not trans women are women.

25:59.960 --> 26:04.540
And in the self id view the term woman ends up being an empty word with no meaning making

26:04.540 --> 26:08.800
everything and everyone simultaneously women and not women including a bunch of people

26:08.800 --> 26:12.100
that the progs want explicitly not to be women like cis men.

26:12.100 --> 26:16.160
Each of the five lenses fail to fulfill the progressives agenda when it comes to the question

26:16.160 --> 26:19.080
of are all trans women actually women.

26:19.080 --> 26:20.660
So what do we do now?

26:20.660 --> 26:22.200
Personally I don't care I'm not a progressive.

26:22.200 --> 26:25.120
I'm not chained to this requirement that all trans women be women.

26:25.120 --> 26:29.660
I'm perfectly happy to gatekeep some people who claim to be trans women out of the label

26:29.660 --> 26:33.800
of woman and that attitude frees us to consider two more possible positions.

26:33.800 --> 26:37.240
The first one is that simply trans women aren't women at all.

26:37.240 --> 26:41.660
When I talk to trans women who aren't ideologically captured by the left they generally say they're

26:41.660 --> 26:44.960
okay with not being women they just don't want to be treated as men.

26:44.960 --> 26:48.640
They know that they don't fulfill the taxonomy view of what a woman is but they also don't

26:48.640 --> 26:52.780
fulfill the social role view of what a man is and in terms of that taxonomy view they're

26:52.780 --> 26:56.700
often neuter producing no gametes depending on if they've had certain types of surgery

26:56.700 --> 26:58.460
or how long they've been on hormones.

26:58.460 --> 27:03.800
For them if trans woman is just its own separate thing distinct from both men and women they're

27:03.800 --> 27:05.840
fine with that and I can see the logic here.

27:05.840 --> 27:09.520
For example trans women have medical needs that are different from both men and women.

27:09.520 --> 27:12.960
The attitude of I don't care what you view me as if trans women aren't women but just

27:12.960 --> 27:16.280
its own thing fine just leave me alone so I can have my private life.

27:16.280 --> 27:20.520
That's a pretty common view among trans women who aren't activists and to me that seems

27:20.520 --> 27:21.960
perfectly reasonable.

27:21.960 --> 27:26.960
Ten years ago the left had a winning argument a knockout punch on this topic and it's this

27:26.960 --> 27:31.400
women are adult human females but to be kind and decent we should respect people's identities

27:31.400 --> 27:32.880
in a polite society.

27:32.880 --> 27:36.820
However there are some areas of life where biological sex should win out like for example

27:36.820 --> 27:37.820
in women's sports.

27:37.820 --> 27:41.580
There you go conversation over we respect the biological reality that underpins human

27:41.580 --> 27:45.400
sexual taxonomy while understanding that in a liberal society there should be reasonable

27:45.400 --> 27:50.060
accommodations made for the outliers also while not allowing the outliers to rule over

27:50.060 --> 27:51.980
all of society from the margins.

27:51.980 --> 27:56.020
This is a conception of trans acceptance that doesn't demand other people think that all

27:56.080 --> 27:59.300
trans women are women and there's no difference between them or any other brain dead nonsense

27:59.300 --> 28:00.300
like that.

28:00.300 --> 28:04.340
You don't genuinely need to believe that a trans woman is a woman deep in your heart

28:04.340 --> 28:07.320
of hearts in order for trans women to still have a place at the table.

28:07.320 --> 28:09.240
You simply need to not be an asshole.

28:09.240 --> 28:13.820
This was the winning leftist position 10 years ago and the left abandoned it in order to

28:13.820 --> 28:19.180
directly defy reality and logic with the insistence that everyone else must be true believers.

28:19.180 --> 28:20.700
For them it's not enough that you're polite.

28:20.700 --> 28:25.280
You must view reality the exact way they do through their exact lens with their exact

28:25.280 --> 28:29.360
logic even if it breaks or else you're a transphobe utter nonsense.

28:29.360 --> 28:33.980
The second new position is that trans women are women but that most of the people we see

28:33.980 --> 28:38.600
right now claiming to be trans aren't actually trans and in order to explain that I'm going

28:38.600 --> 28:41.720
to need to explain the concept of gender dysphoria.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.540
Actually we're like half an hour into the video and I can't believe I haven't covered

28:44.540 --> 28:45.540
this yet.

28:45.540 --> 28:49.340
Gender dysphoria is what we call the distress experienced by a person due to the mismatch

28:49.340 --> 28:51.780
between their gender and their biological sex.

28:51.780 --> 28:55.580
In this conversation biological sex is the physical reality of your body, the primary

28:55.580 --> 29:00.400
and secondary sexual characteristics while gender is the internal feeling and experience

29:00.400 --> 29:01.480
of that biology.

29:01.480 --> 29:04.620
If you're a cis man in terms of your body you've got a functioning dick.

29:04.620 --> 29:08.380
In terms of your brain you're expecting a dick to be there and to be able to do dick

29:08.380 --> 29:09.500
things with it.

29:09.500 --> 29:11.340
Those two things line up and you're good to go.

29:11.340 --> 29:15.500
From what we understand so far in a person with gender dysphoria their brain is expecting

29:15.500 --> 29:17.280
a different body to what they're hooked up to.

29:17.280 --> 29:20.580
The common analogy used is like a computer with the wrong drivers installed.

29:20.580 --> 29:24.660
We don't know why people experience dysphoria but there's some evidence for a lot of very

29:24.660 --> 29:25.760
different causes.

29:25.760 --> 29:29.080
It might be an effect of puberty which passes when puberty is complete.

29:29.080 --> 29:31.700
It might be a side effect of depression or abuse.

29:31.700 --> 29:35.500
It might be the result of hormonal changes within the mother that the fetus is exposed

29:35.500 --> 29:36.500
to.

29:36.500 --> 29:37.900
It might be a genetic abnormality.

29:37.900 --> 29:40.680
It might be all of these things we just don't know enough yet.

29:40.680 --> 29:44.200
And before leftoids start coping, yes this is clearly a mental illness, if you're one

29:44.200 --> 29:47.820
of those idiots who says it's not then you have no place in this conversation.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.820
If dysphoria isn't a mental illness that causes distress, why do people transition

29:50.820 --> 29:52.980
to treat it then, you fucking mongoloid?

29:52.980 --> 29:56.860
Here's the thing though, back when we discussed that social role lens, I mentioned the femme

29:56.860 --> 29:57.860
boys.

29:57.860 --> 30:00.080
Gay men who look, speak, and act feminine.

30:00.080 --> 30:03.980
Who adopt a feminine gender role in their relationships and sometimes in society.

30:03.980 --> 30:04.980
But they're not trans.

30:04.980 --> 30:07.460
They don't view themselves as women, they're still men.

30:07.460 --> 30:08.460
They're just feminine men.

30:08.460 --> 30:10.580
They don't fit into this view of gender dysphoria.

30:10.580 --> 30:15.940
And that's probably why so many trans activists out there end up being toxic as fuck egg hatchers

30:15.940 --> 30:18.460
trying to push feminine men into being trans.

30:18.460 --> 30:22.780
Because femme boys are a giant red flag that our current understanding of gender dysphoria

30:22.780 --> 30:24.340
doesn't quite make sense.

30:24.340 --> 30:28.080
This is just my personal theory, I only have my intuition to go on here.

30:28.080 --> 30:31.700
But I've spoken to a bunch of trans women at this point, and I've asked them all.

30:31.700 --> 30:36.340
If they could wake up tomorrow as cis women with a real vagina and uterus and ovaries,

30:36.340 --> 30:39.900
and an annoying monthly cycle, and the chromosomes and all the rest of it, they would.

30:39.900 --> 30:43.440
To me that sounds like what they're experiencing isn't gender dysphoria, it's better described

30:43.440 --> 30:44.440
as sex dysphoria.

30:44.440 --> 30:47.200
It's not that trans women want to be women, that's only a part of it.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.120
They want to be female from birth.

30:49.120 --> 30:51.440
They literally want to be adult human females.

30:51.440 --> 30:55.520
They can't be, obviously, but transitioning and becoming more female-like is how they

30:55.520 --> 30:58.200
alleviate the stress of not being female.

30:58.200 --> 31:01.180
The social role stuff, the passing, the behavior, that's all part of it.

31:01.180 --> 31:04.000
And they take what they can get, but the thing they really want, the thing that is forever

31:04.000 --> 31:05.760
out of reach, is the biology.

31:05.760 --> 31:08.940
This is why the social role view is part of it, but it's not enough.

31:08.940 --> 31:11.000
What does it mean to feel being female?

31:11.000 --> 31:14.680
Is it liking to cook, or liking the color pink, or being attracted to masculine men?

31:14.680 --> 31:17.360
A lot of women are like that, but a lot of gay men are like that too.

31:17.360 --> 31:21.860
There's still that biological component in feeling a deep mismatch between your mind

31:21.860 --> 31:22.860
and your body.

31:22.860 --> 31:27.000
I know it's not exactly the female brain in a male body analogy.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.720
We've got some evidence through brain scans that trans women's brains straddle the space

31:30.720 --> 31:34.000
between cis men and cis women, and the whole topic is way more complicated.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.120
But that view works for this conversation.

31:36.120 --> 31:38.860
Additionally, the taxonomy view isn't enough either.

31:38.860 --> 31:41.740
Let's say that you're somebody who is a strict believer in the woman is an adult

31:41.740 --> 31:42.900
human female thing.

31:42.900 --> 31:46.420
Okay, when you see a person who looks like a woman at the grocery store, what exactly

31:46.420 --> 31:49.640
are you going to do before you decide to call them sir or ma'am?

31:49.640 --> 31:52.060
Are you going to test her gametes where you treat her like a woman?

31:52.060 --> 31:55.020
Most of us don't get to verify that sort of thing in a public setting, unless you're

31:55.020 --> 31:56.020
pretty creepy.

31:56.020 --> 32:00.500
Even for people who claim to follow a strictly biological lens in this conversation, in casual

32:00.500 --> 32:04.740
situations, they will still put on the social role lens, just because it's quicker and

32:04.740 --> 32:05.740
easier.

32:05.740 --> 32:09.140
It's also just so funny to listen to Ben Shapiro on Joe Rogan intuitively call Blair

32:09.140 --> 32:13.220
White she, and then immediately forcing himself to say he in order to try and maintain his

32:13.220 --> 32:14.340
political position.

32:14.340 --> 32:19.040
In normal day to day living, most people forget about biology and default to some version

32:19.040 --> 32:21.760
of the social role view in casual circumstances.

32:21.760 --> 32:24.420
If they look like a woman, then they are one, and if they don't, they don't.

32:24.420 --> 32:27.220
You see a lady in a dress with long hair, looks pretty feminine, you're not going

32:27.220 --> 32:30.260
to ask a question about biology, you're going to assume, oh, that's a woman.

32:30.260 --> 32:34.440
This might suck for people who can't pass, but it is how the majority of people function.

32:34.440 --> 32:39.000
If dysphoria is the issue, and it's not just going away with time or alleviation of

32:39.000 --> 32:42.840
other problems, then we have two choices, make the brain more masculine, or make the

32:42.840 --> 32:45.560
body more feminine, to bring the two in line.

32:45.560 --> 32:50.880
And so far, it seems like making the brain more masculine is way, way tougher than making

32:50.880 --> 32:52.140
the body more feminine.

32:52.140 --> 32:57.080
A lot of people on the right say these people need help, not transitioning, failing to realize

32:57.080 --> 32:59.120
that transitioning is the help.

32:59.120 --> 33:04.160
Success rates for various forms of therapy to masculinize the brain are abysmal.

33:04.160 --> 33:08.760
Way worse than the success rates to feminize the body, which frankly already aren't great.

33:08.760 --> 33:12.680
But all of this is only legitimate if the dysphoria is both present and unchanging.

33:12.680 --> 33:16.280
There's a new wave of trans activism which declares, as a natural end result of that

33:16.280 --> 33:20.560
self-ID view, that you don't even need dysphoria to be trans, you just need to identify as

33:20.560 --> 33:21.560
being trans.

33:21.560 --> 33:25.240
Nowadays, if you believe that dysphoria is required, then you're a transmedicalist,

33:25.240 --> 33:28.440
which is a negative word used to describe people who think that being trans is fundamentally

33:28.440 --> 33:29.440
a medical phenomenon.

33:29.440 --> 33:33.260
But the people who believe that you don't need dysphoria to be trans are probably the

33:33.260 --> 33:37.220
single dumbest group I've spoken about in this video more than any other.

33:37.220 --> 33:39.960
If you can simply identify as another gender, then why transition at all?

33:39.960 --> 33:43.180
Just identify as the gender associated with your birth sex and dysphoria goes away lol,

33:43.180 --> 33:44.780
obviously that's not how it works.

33:44.780 --> 33:49.260
The issue ultimately is, if we take the entire class of people that the progs would call

33:49.260 --> 33:52.860
trans women, we see within it, broadly, two categories.

33:52.860 --> 33:57.300
In the first category we see people who, even though they're biologically male, they have

33:57.300 --> 34:00.420
an affinity for femininity that goes beyond free will.

34:00.420 --> 34:04.260
They've been like this their whole lives, and they can't choose not to be.

34:04.260 --> 34:09.100
For them, nothing works, nothing alleviates their pain, with the exception of transitioning.

34:09.100 --> 34:12.060
They have something more, something deeper than just identification.

34:12.060 --> 34:16.560
They have a female essence in their body language, in their behavior, in the way that they speak,

34:16.560 --> 34:20.320
that is, unfortunately, at war with their own male biology.

34:20.320 --> 34:23.660
In the second category, we see people who have chosen to identify as women, and if you

34:23.660 --> 34:25.360
don't accept their self-ID, you're a bigot.

34:25.360 --> 34:28.920
There's no feminine essence to appeal to here, there's no sense that they can't help but

34:28.920 --> 34:31.740
be in this unfortunate situation, there's only narcissism.

34:31.740 --> 34:36.440
If there is truly a place for trans women to actually be women, it's going to be along

34:36.440 --> 34:37.440
these lines.

34:37.440 --> 34:42.120
The feminine essence that they can't help but embody, that shows itself not as a self-ID,

34:42.120 --> 34:43.920
but as an uncontrollable affinity.

34:43.920 --> 34:48.760
The issue is, ultimately, that the self-ID view of this topic is just the gender abolitionist

34:48.760 --> 34:50.440
view in disguise.

34:50.440 --> 34:54.760
Self-ID advocates know that their politics, if ever widely adopted, destroys gender as

34:54.760 --> 34:55.760
a concept.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.360
Either way, the TERFs are correct when they say that trans activists want to destroy the

34:59.360 --> 35:00.520
concept of women.

35:00.520 --> 35:03.880
The two positions outside of the progressive framework are, ironically enough, the two

35:03.880 --> 35:06.520
most pro-trans coherent positions.

35:06.520 --> 35:09.920
The first, where trans women aren't women, and that's fine because they're also not men.

35:09.920 --> 35:13.720
The second, where people who have an innate and uncontrollable affinity towards female

35:13.720 --> 35:15.080
biology are women.

35:15.080 --> 35:19.080
The second one includes all cis women and all trans women who have gender dysphoria,

35:19.080 --> 35:22.480
but it excludes all of the trans trenders, all the people who say you don't need dysphoria

35:22.480 --> 35:25.300
to be trans, all the people who do it because it's a trendy aesthetic.

35:25.300 --> 35:27.200
All of those people aren't women.

35:27.200 --> 35:32.100
This is the only logically coherent framework by which at least some trans women are women

35:32.100 --> 35:33.740
that also excludes men.

35:33.740 --> 35:39.020
This is the most pro-trans position possible that actually makes sense, and the progs reject

35:39.020 --> 35:40.020
it.

35:40.020 --> 35:43.180
They would rather wreck the concept of woman entirely than compromise and get at least

35:43.180 --> 35:47.500
some of their stated goals, because their actual goal is to wreck the concept of woman.

35:47.500 --> 35:52.540
But to somebody who isn't ideologically captured by leftism, both of these positions are reasonable

35:52.540 --> 35:53.540
compromises.

35:53.540 --> 35:57.900
I find that off Twitter, off campus, and off the left, most trans people just want to chill

35:57.900 --> 35:58.900
and be left alone.

35:58.900 --> 36:01.500
They're not going to demand that you religiously believe that they're women.

36:01.500 --> 36:04.460
They're just going to want you to be polite to them if you have to interact, and not shout

36:04.460 --> 36:08.080
at them in the middle of the store because they can't pass or you clock them or something.

36:08.080 --> 36:09.080
And you know what?

36:09.080 --> 36:10.980
That's a perfectly reasonable thing to want.

36:10.980 --> 36:14.340
So to answer the question once and for all, are trans women actually women?

36:14.340 --> 36:18.100
In almost all views, the answer is necessarily no.

36:18.100 --> 36:21.880
There is a view that allows some people who claim to be trans women to be women, but there

36:21.880 --> 36:24.720
is no view that allows all trans women to be women.

36:24.720 --> 36:28.160
And progressives reject the most coherent trans-positive position, not because they

36:28.160 --> 36:32.520
want to include more trans people in the acceptance, but because trans people are simply their

36:32.520 --> 36:37.040
political pawns, and they are happy to use, abuse, and discard them as such.
