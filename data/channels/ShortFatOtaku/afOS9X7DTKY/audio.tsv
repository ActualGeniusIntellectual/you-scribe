0	8060	It's finally time I tackled this subject.
8060	11760	I talked about it briefly on the most recent sip, and realized that I should get my thoughts
11760	16220	on this topic down in some sort of thought-out, pre-scripted, organized way, without garbling
16220	18540	it on stream, because that's how I roll.
18540	23420	So let's finally examine the question, are trans women actually women?
23420	28260	Well, let's focus on the specifics, namely what we mean when we ask the question, are
28260	33580	trans women women, and what lens we're using to try and discover an answer to the question.
33580	37500	Conservatives tend to rely on the intuitive answer here, a simple no, often coupled with
37500	39320	the pithier mark, define woman.
39320	43180	The conservative position here is that woman is defined as adult human female, because
43180	46300	trans women are adult human males, they can't be women.
46300	49200	Conservatives generally leave it here because the logic is compact and punchy.
49200	52540	But let's actually analyze what makes this view operate.
52540	56700	This is where we get to the first lens, the taxonomy view of biological sex.
56700	60340	Taxonomy is the science of classification, how we organize a bunch of separate things
60340	61500	into groups of things.
61500	64020	We use it for libraries, for computers, for finance.
64020	68380	But important to us right now is biological taxonomy, specifically sexual taxonomy.
68380	69940	I'll just cut right to the heart of it.
69940	74160	When it comes to biological life on earth, we identify males as members of a species
74160	78140	that produces small gametes, which is almost always some type of sperm, and we identify
78140	81880	females as members of the species that produces large gametes, which is almost always some
81880	82880	type of egg.
82880	86900	There are some single-celled organisms that reproduce either by cell fission or instead
86900	90880	by swapping gametes, but they're so small that the gametes are the same size, meaning
90880	92860	neither is really male or female.
92860	94200	But those are exceptions.
94200	98180	Once we move beyond primitive cellular life, it's all about gamete sizes.
98180	99180	It's not about chromosomes.
99180	101320	A lot of people like to say it's either XX or XY.
101320	105520	But birds, fish, and snakes all have a ZW chrominal system, and yet they still have
105520	106760	males and females.
106760	110120	Some bugs and bats have an XO system, moths have a ZO system.
110120	111700	The point is that chromosomes aren't enough.
111700	115860	Even in humans, somebody can have abnormal chromosomes and still produce large or small
115860	116860	gametes.
116860	120520	It's not about who has what genitals, it's not about hormones, it's not about who does
120520	122900	the penetrating or who carries the child or who raises.
122900	124860	Throw all that out the window, it's irrelevant.
124860	128400	Sexual taxonomy is determined by the size of the gametes you produce.
128400	132740	Almost every species has males and females corresponding to producing small and large
132740	134160	gametes respectively.
134160	138380	Some species, like earthworms and snails, and a lot of plants, are hermaphroditic, meaning
138380	141620	they produce both small and large gametes at the same time.
141620	145660	In humans, there are intersex people, but it still comes down to what gametes, if any,
145660	146660	they produce.
146660	152380	So far, there's been zero documented cases of any human ever producing both sets of gametes.
152380	154220	With that being said, let's move on.
154220	155940	Consider cattle as a species.
155940	159300	Adult males of the species, meaning cattle that can produce small gametes, are called
159300	160340	bulls.
160340	163380	Adult females, cattle that can produce large gametes, are called cows.
163380	164860	Immature cattle are called calves.
164860	168860	An immature male, meaning a cattle that cannot yet produce small gametes but will once he
168860	171980	matures, is a bull calf, while an immature female is a heifer.
171980	173300	But here's where it gets interesting.
173300	177940	A castrated male, meaning a cattle that could produce small gametes but has a sexual organ
177940	179860	surgically removed, is an ox.
179860	182900	Oxen are preferable for labor over bulls, being easier to control.
182900	187020	You'll find a similar naming convention among a lot of animal species, at least in English.
187020	188020	Here's another quick example.
188020	190860	For deer, adult males are bucks or stags, depending on the species.
190860	192500	Adult females are generally does.
192500	195540	Children are generally fawns or kids, depending on species and gender.
195540	197540	A sterilized deer is a Javier.
197540	201800	Natural taxonomy commonly breaks out into these five classifications, all revolving
201800	203160	around gamete production.
203160	207020	Immature male, immature female, mature male, mature female, and neuter.
207020	210460	In a taxonomic sense, there's no reason that humans would be different than any other
210460	211520	animal on Earth.
211520	214940	We have children who cannot yet produce gametes but will, boys and girls.
214940	217300	We have adults who do produce gametes, men and women.
217300	220180	And we have people who can't produce gametes anymore, eunuchs.
220180	224820	This schema also applies to intersex and trans people, based on if they produce large gametes,
224820	226940	small gametes, or no gametes.
226940	230980	So if we're examining the question of, are trans women actually women, through the lens
230980	234020	of human sexual taxonomy, the answer is no.
234020	236420	They might produce small gametes, making them men.
236420	239020	They might produce no gametes, making them eunuchs.
239020	242620	But until we're living in the transhumanist future, where trans women can have a fully
242620	247260	functioning uterus and ovaries transplanted into them, they can never produce large gametes,
247260	248780	meaning they can never be women.
248780	250720	But to some, this is an offensive answer.
250720	251720	Humans aren't like animals.
251720	255180	We can't use biological sexual classification standards on us, the same way that we use
255180	256180	them on every other species.
256180	258420	For people, okay, fair enough.
258420	262140	There are other lenses beyond the taxonomy one that are worth considering.
262140	264660	Another widely held lens is the social role view.
264660	268220	The idea here is that a woman is a person who takes on a socially feminine function,
268220	271900	or behaves and presents in a socially feminine manner, or is treated by others in a feminine
271900	272900	way.
272900	276860	Okay, on this surface, this seems like a fine trans inclusive lens to view the problem with.
276860	281220	And there are at least a few pro-trans feminists over the years who have agreed with this view.
281220	283780	But the more we dig into it, the more problems we begin to unearth.
283780	288340	Firstly, what do we mean by taking on a socially feminine function or behaving and presenting
288340	289860	in a socially feminine manner?
289860	293780	It's very tough to define what this means in any sort of universal way, like the taxonomy
293780	297600	view manages to, especially considering differences in the feminine gender role across culture
297600	298600	and time.
298600	301900	But let's just hand wave that and say, you know, whatever passes for feminine right now
301900	303300	in our culture or something.
303300	306620	Let's say that we've discovered the universal feminine gender role.
306620	310100	There's still a problem here though, and that has to do with the framing of the question.
310100	313500	When a progressive is seeking for the answer to the question, are trans women actually
313500	314500	women?
314500	317460	What they're actually looking for is an answer to the question, are all trans women
317460	318460	women?
318460	321700	Meaning more specifically, they are seeking a definition of woman that includes all cis
321700	325580	women and all trans women, but no cis men or trans men.
325580	328780	That is what they require in their fully inclusive definition.
328780	330940	Not a single trans woman is left behind.
330940	334320	Does the social role view provide the answer the Prague is looking for?
334320	336060	Unfortunately for them, no.
336060	340380	Regardless of what social role we pin down and say, this is the social role you can adopt
340380	341380	to become a woman.
341380	344740	It still doesn't include all trans women and exclude all men.
344740	348500	There are absolutely extremely submissive men who would take on this feminine gender
348500	349500	role.
349500	350500	They might even call themselves girl.
350500	354660	That's a thing in the gay community for sure, but they don't actually consider themselves
354660	355660	women.
355660	359780	In the same vein, there are absolutely trans women who would not adopt this gender role.
359780	362820	Maybe because they're not out of the closet yet, maybe it's because they don't pass
362820	364100	or they never will pass.
364100	368580	Hell, there's both trans women and cis women who are very masculine presenting, the
368580	372420	butch lesbian types, and they might say things like, women don't owe you femininity.
372420	374740	That's a pretty common feminist sentiment, in fact.
374740	379180	The problem with the social role view is that trans women who don't perform the role would
379180	384220	not be considered women, while men who do perform the role would be forced to be women,
384220	386560	and the Progs can't stand for that.
386560	391040	Some of the more radical activists on the left, both trans and not, have adopted the
391040	393500	gender abolitionist lens on the topic.
393500	396540	For these people, they want to abolish the concept of gender itself.
396540	399380	In their ideal world, there is no more man or woman.
399380	400760	Gender is a dead concept.
400760	402100	Nobody knows what it means anymore.
402100	405300	Nobody has the language to describe a difference between a man and a woman.
405300	407220	Nobody can recognize the difference between men and women.
407220	411140	The human race is all just made up of people who look different from each other.
411140	415660	In this view, definitionally, no trans woman can be women, because there are no women anymore.
415660	419940	There are no trans women anymore, too, ignoring the stupidity of this position.
419940	424020	Even if we take it at face value, the progressives' quest to find a definition of woman that includes
424020	428340	all trans women is not fulfilled here, because this framework doesn't have a definition
428340	429420	of woman at all.
429420	433920	It honestly becomes truly incredible to watch a trans woman take this position in real time,
433920	437900	because it's in complete conflict with the view that nobody is ever socially conditioned
437900	438900	into being trans.
438900	442420	That's all just conservatives basically calling people groomers.
442420	446460	Except by the abolitionists' own logic, everybody is socially conditioned into being
446460	447460	trans.
447460	448820	There's also the prescriptive lens.
448820	452360	Within this framework, the question is reframed as an affirmative statement.
452360	455440	Trans women are women isn't a description of reality, but a prescription of what we
455440	456680	want reality to be.
456680	459600	Kinda like people who hold up signs saying healthcare is a human right.
459600	463400	Within a natural rights framework, healthcare is not a right, but even ignoring that, even
463400	465280	taking the view that rights flow from the state.
465280	468540	In a state where healthcare isn't a right, the statement healthcare is a human right
468540	469720	is definitionally false.
469720	472280	But they're using it as a prescription, not a description.
472280	474540	And the same goes for trans women are women here.
474540	477820	In essence, what they're saying is trans women should be women.
477820	481480	The argument for this is ultimately going to be based in utility, in good consequences.
481480	485640	That society is better off if trans women are women than if trans women aren't women.
485640	487080	So trans women should be women.
487080	490920	We're going to have to dive into the postmodernist commie gobbledygook, but let's actually
490920	492140	consider this logic.
492140	497000	The postmodernists are correct when they say that our language is as it is because it serves
497000	498000	some function.
498000	501840	I think it was the father of postmodernism, the French philosopher Derrida, who described
501840	505520	language as a series of rafts in the ocean that we never actually leave to get to shore.
505520	508300	I don't know, I haven't read this guy's stuff since university.
508300	512440	The postmodernists are correct when they say that our language is as it is, not because
512440	515880	it's immutable, but because it serves some utility to us.
515880	520600	For example, when I say the word water, there's three separate things wrapped up in there.
520600	523400	There's the word water, which is itself meaningless, it's just a word.
523400	526920	A person who doesn't know my language, who hears me say water, is just going to hear
526920	527920	random sounds.
527920	531260	Then there's the concept of water, which is what I'm thinking of in my head when I
531260	532260	say water.
532260	536040	And when I say to you, this is water, I'm hoping you have the same concept in your head
536040	539740	of water that I do, so that I'm conveying to you not just the sound of the word, but
539740	541300	the meaning that I intend.
541300	546240	And then there's actually the physical substance that is water, the clear, tasteless, odorless
546240	549540	liquid that is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
549540	553560	That substance, the substance of water, I can never truly get to it with language alone.
553560	556900	I just described it to you there, but it's not like water poured over your headphones
556900	557900	or something.
557900	562060	Description of the thing is not the thing itself, and the only way to know water is
562060	564380	to experience water beyond language.
564380	568840	There are even some more hardcore postmodernists called anti-realists who think that it's
568840	572520	impossible to know water even if you touch it or taste it because your senses are still
572520	576320	subjective and a product of your own mind, and that there's no real world beyond human
576320	577320	perception.
577320	579800	But if you're going to go down the ultimate skeptic rabbit hole, all of reality breaks
579800	583200	down and it's honestly pretty retarded because nobody actually lives their life that way.
583200	587640	In my opinion, there does seem to be a world beyond human perception of it, and words can
587640	590040	convey meaning without truly knowing that world.
590040	593680	We called water, water, long before we knew what hydrogen and oxygen was.
593680	597380	And yet, the meaning remained even as we learned more about what it was.
597380	600620	Sometimes meanings change with new knowledge, but nonetheless it does seem to be the case
600620	604900	that a lot of language does at least point to something real even if it's not the thing
604900	605900	itself.
605900	610040	So, the prescriptive view of gender is, if all of language is this postmodernist series
610040	614060	of rafts, and we construct it all to point at real world phenomenon in a way that is
614060	618220	useful to us, then we should construct woman to include transwoman.
618220	620500	The issue is that useful for us part.
620500	623520	The taxonomy view that we discussed back at the start of the video is actually the
623520	626220	natural end result of this prescriptivist view.
626220	630360	We find it useful to classify different types of a species by their reproductive capability,
630360	632940	and man and woman for humans is no different.
632940	636420	Most men, when they say that they are romantically attracted to women, they have packed into
636420	641280	that label, biologically female, capable of having heterosexual sex, capable of carrying
641280	643600	children, and transwomen can't do any of that.
643600	647560	The common Prague reply at this point is, would you say that a woman who can't carry
647560	648800	children isn't a woman?
648800	652640	The truth is, believe it or not, a lot of people, both men and women, do consider that
652640	653640	to be the case.
653640	657120	Like, it sucks, it's a shitty reality, I'm sure it's offensive to many people.
657120	662120	But the human taxonomy view views these people as neuter, and for most of human history we've
662120	663300	had no problem saying it.
663300	667160	And this is where the social engineering part of the conversation comes into play.
667160	671820	If leftoids can push the culture into a position where most people no longer find utility in
671820	677060	using gender in this way, then the prescriptive view of gender would necessarily desync with
677060	678060	the taxonomic view.
678060	681740	That's why it's prescriptive, it's saying we should do this, it's a moral statement,
681740	682860	not a statement of fact.
682860	686500	But that's a problem for the Prague if we're talking about the question, are transwomen
686500	687500	actually women?
687500	691180	The prescriptive answer is, they're not, and they should be, but that's still a no.
691180	695260	And it always will be until we reach a point that the majority culture no longer cares
695260	697540	about biological sex when it comes to finding a partner.
697540	699540	And frankly I wouldn't hold my breath on that one.
699540	703380	So, when the progressive seeks to find a definition of woman that includes all transwomen, while
703380	705940	excluding all men, nothing seems to fit.
705940	707780	The taxonomy view says that none of them are.
707780	711500	The social role view includes some trans women, but not all of them, and it includes some
711500	712500	men too.
712500	715340	The abolitionist view says no because there are no women at all.
715340	719220	The prescriptive view also says no, but it focuses on what should be, rather than what
719220	720460	the truth actually is.
720460	724420	It's at this point the progressive falls into the ultimately arbitrary position that
724420	728820	is necessarily the end result of the social engineering deep within the prescriptive view,
728820	730980	the self-identification lens.
730980	735020	Most people who consider the prescriptive view end up abandoning utility once they recognize
735020	739860	that most people actually find a lot of utility in differentiation based on reproductive ability,
739860	742580	so they abandon utility in favor of harm reduction.
742580	746060	At this point it doesn't matter what the objective truth is, or if it even exists.
746060	748920	It doesn't matter if some people prefer the current definitions.
748920	752760	If we are the ones that can choose what all this shit means, we should just open the doors
752760	757060	and let everybody identify as what they want to minimize the harm that comes with gatekeeping.
757060	761820	Therefore the self-ID lens is one where anybody who self-identifies as a woman is a woman.
761820	764780	There are no qualifiers other than identification.
764780	768580	On the surface, it seems like the question, are trans women actually women, is definitionally
768580	769580	true now.
769580	771900	They are women because we've defined them as women, and if there are any trans women
771900	775340	out there who don't make the cut by some other metric, don't worry about it, because
775340	779380	we've completely unmoored the concept of woman from any measurable metric.
779380	783780	It's simply a class that you can belong to by virtue of identifying as belonging to it.
783780	787140	Now a conservative would immediately say, this is a circular definition.
787140	788140	You see this a lot.
788140	789140	Define woman.
789140	790140	Anyone who identifies as a woman.
790140	791140	You can't use the word in its own definition.
791140	792140	That's circular.
792140	793140	And this is true.
794020	801220	The definition of woman is a person that identifies as such.
801220	804260	What does such refer to here in your sentence, you brainlet?
804260	805820	You haven't actually changed anything.
805820	809140	You've just subbed out woman for a variable that directly means a woman and brings nothing
809140	810140	else to the table.
810140	811140	It's still circular.
811140	812220	You're just too dumb to recognize it.
812220	816060	But often the conservative stops thinking here and says, aha, I'm correct.
816060	818220	It is circular, but let's keep going.
818220	820940	Let's examine exactly what the problem is.
820940	824660	These issues are deliberately ignorant to the point that they're not capable of talking
824660	826400	about any of these issues.
826400	828700	Can you go over circular arguments like real quick?
828700	829700	There's no such thing.
829700	833100	Guys, there is no reason a definition can't be circular.
833100	837340	Not that my definition of woman is, but it doesn't have to be people like people start
837340	841220	pretending there were all these like rules about what a definition can be.
841220	844100	There aren't words can mean literally anything.
844100	849220	The reason we choose definitions and use them is to serve utility, but they never get to
849220	850220	that point.
850380	853020	I wish I could get to that point in an argument with a conservative.
853020	855300	I'm sure Vosch considers me a conservative.
855300	858700	And for your sake, buddy, because I like you a lot, I am happy to directly engage with
858700	859700	your question.
859700	860920	He's partially correct.
860920	864560	This is Derrida's observation of language being a series of raffs again.
864560	868780	But on the other hand, you can de tallo the neutalov until it reached Parkst, then keep
868780	871040	the part that was both Tenir and Hoch.
871040	873820	Is the ton woe Roy or Beccafroy?
873820	874860	What did I just ask you there?
874860	877080	What meaning did I just convey to you?
877080	881620	Language can mean anything, but it does have to mean something that we all agree upon in
881620	882620	order to be useful.
882620	886100	Otherwise, it's just individuals using their own private languages that aren't actually
886100	887840	communicating any meaning.
887840	888840	Here's the thing.
888840	892400	Any highly complicated class that involves multiple traits is actually really hard to
892400	893400	define.
893400	894400	For example, what's a chair?
894400	896600	Four legs with a seat in the back that people sit on?
896600	898400	I mean, yeah, but that's also a horse.
898400	899400	What's a car?
899400	900400	Something with wheels?
900400	901400	Is a truck a car?
901400	902400	Maybe.
902400	903400	Is a motorcycle a car?
903400	905520	Well, if it needs more than two wheels, how about a motorcycle with a sidecar?
905960	906960	How about a car with three wheels?
906960	908880	How about a broken car with no wheels?
908880	911020	If it needs an engine, is a lawnmower a car?
911020	913720	If it needs to run on gas, is an electric car a car?
913720	916600	If an electric car actually is a car, is a golf cart a car?
916600	921480	Every single definition for every classification has fuzzy edges, and frankly, gender, even
921480	923460	sex is no different.
923460	926560	Male and female are still categories that we made up.
926560	930880	It's not like the word male or female is printed on our cells if you zoom in with a microscope.
930880	935380	XX and XY might be there, sure, but again, it's possible for an XX person to produce
935380	938980	small gametes, even though the overwhelming majority of them produce large gametes, and
938980	940460	vice versa for an XY.
940460	944360	We notice that organisms produce small gametes, large gametes, or no gametes, but we still
944360	948660	choose to use that as a basis for our classification of male, female, and neuter.
948660	951880	When we're talking about man and woman, we notice a collection of traits.
951880	955720	We notice that they largely fit into two groups, and we notice that identifying those groups
955720	958660	as two separate things brings us utility.
958660	961440	Consider type 2 diabetes, you know, the type that I probably have.
961440	965020	It's ultimately arbitrary that we choose a certain amount of insulin resistance to
965020	968520	qualify for diabetic, prediabetic, and not diabetic at all.
968520	971680	It could have been a few percentage points different either way, but nonetheless, the
971680	976800	label of diabetic obviously brings us some utility, and it does point at something real,
976800	979400	even if its barriers are constructed by us.
979400	981800	This is the deep problem with Vosch's position.
981800	986120	He says that everything is just a social construct, and that's true, but then he says that because
986120	989440	everything is a social construct, therefore we can just make everything the way we want
989440	991200	it to be, and that is false.
991200	996080	One, it requires broad consensus to truly change the meaning of language, not just bullying
996080	999040	a dictionary into compliance by ratioing them on Twitter.
999040	1004080	And two, we have the language that we do because that language points at something in reality.
1004080	1006380	It is constructed, but it's not really arbitrary.
1006380	1011120	It's the result of our observations of the world, and even if we do observe edge cases,
1011120	1012560	exceptions generally prove the rule.
1012560	1016440	Additionally, when we're talking about gender and sex, the edge cases aren't trans people,
1016440	1020400	they're intersex people, and it's frankly annoying when trans activists coop intersex
1020400	1022760	talking points to try and legitimize their views.
1022760	1028120	So, when Vosch says there's no reason definitions can't be circular, he's referring to Derrida's
1028120	1029120	rafts.
1029120	1030120	And fair enough.
1030120	1032440	If you dig deep enough, all definitions are circular.
1032440	1036080	Quick example, in the Oxford Dictionary, what is a woman, an adult female human being?
1036080	1037080	What's a female?
1037080	1040860	Of or denoting the sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs, distinguished biologically
1040860	1042880	by the production of large gametes.
1042880	1046440	What's a gamete, a male or female cell that joins with the cell of the opposite sex to
1046440	1047440	form a zygote?
1047440	1049120	Well, we've circled back around a female again.
1049120	1050120	What's a zygote?
1050120	1053400	A cell that develops into a person or an animal, formed by the joining together of a male and
1053400	1054400	female gamete.
1054400	1058400	It's very common to find definitions that circle back in on themselves in a few steps.
1058400	1063360	The issue is whether or not the interlocking web of circular references ever actually communicates
1063360	1065680	any meaning through the act of referencing.
1065680	1066680	Here's what I mean.
1066680	1070380	Let's say that you've never felt the softness of a newborn baby's skin.
1070380	1071380	I haven't.
1071380	1072380	I've heard it soft.
1072380	1075240	So, because I've never felt it, when you tell me that it feels soft, that doesn't
1075240	1076240	really help me too much.
1076240	1080920	It might help me a bit if I know what soft is, but I have no idea how soft it is.
1080920	1085440	But if you were to tell me, it's softer than silk, because I know how soft silk feels.
1085440	1088180	I am now a lot closer at understanding what you're saying.
1088180	1092520	This idea is probably best described in Frank Jackson's thought experiment, Mary's Room,
1092520	1096820	where Mary is a scientist who has lived her entire life in a black and white room.
1096820	1100440	During that time, she studied everything there is to know about the color red, all scientific
1100440	1105040	data anyone's ever written about, all descriptions in prose, everything humanity's ever documented
1105040	1106200	about the color red.
1106200	1110440	She's even seen black and white pictures and video of everything that's ever existed,
1110440	1113120	but she's never seen the color red herself.
1113120	1117320	When Mary leaves the black and white room and sees the color red for the first time,
1117320	1122520	does that experience, experiencing what red actually looks like, constitute new knowledge?
1122520	1124000	To me, the answer seems to be yes.
1124000	1128920	The experience of red itself cannot be rationalistically described, but it's still a form of knowledge
1128920	1132480	missing in the verbal and written descriptions of what red is.
1132480	1136680	The point of the Mary's Room thought experiment is that experience is a form of knowledge
1136680	1141020	that you can't directly get at through language, but language combined with experience can
1141020	1144220	lead to new knowledge on the edges of your understanding.
1144220	1146480	That's the softer than silk comment from earlier.
1146480	1150860	Somebody like Mary with all of her rational knowledge, after experiencing the colors red
1150860	1155580	and blue for herself, might be able to say red is like blue, but it has these differences.
1155580	1159800	Her ability to describe those differences are fleshed out by her rational knowledge,
1159800	1163200	but the experience of seeing them forms the foundation.
1163200	1166920	Putting it simply, although Derrida is correct that we never leave the rafts of language,
1166920	1169680	that doesn't mean that we're not in sight of the shoreline.
1169680	1174120	Language is circular, but it's the web of references combined with our own experience
1174120	1176280	that allows us to express meaning.
1176280	1179600	So when Vosch says something like, it doesn't matter if it's circular, anything can be
1179600	1184440	anything, and we're going down the self-ID rabbit hole where the word woman has no qualifiers
1184440	1188300	attached, no experience in the real world is necessary to provide the foundation for
1188300	1189560	knowledge to exist.
1189560	1191120	What does woman mean?
1191120	1192520	It seems to be an empty word.
1192520	1196540	Maybe that's why the UN defines woman as limitless and formless, but that also means
1196540	1199900	that no meaning is communicated when you say the word woman.
1199900	1203260	If we're going by this standard, the word woman means nothing at all, and if it's
1203260	1208480	a word without meaning, then everything and anything and nothing can be a woman, or not
1208480	1209480	be.
1209480	1212400	The progressive search for a definition of woman that includes all trans women but no
1212400	1217340	men necessarily falls apart here, because everything, including men, are simultaneously
1217340	1218800	women and not women.
1218800	1221560	But let's continue down the rabbit hole anyway, just in case you're not convinced
1221560	1222560	yet.
1222560	1224520	Let's say that on my desk I have all sorts of knick-knacks.
1224520	1229200	My wallet, my phone, my headphones, books, pens, old receipts, Funko Pop statues, you
1229200	1230700	know, random assorted junk.
1230700	1235000	And now let's say that I tell you on my desk I have an object known as a blarg.
1235000	1238200	Blargs are only identified by one feature, that is, the feature of being a blarg.
1238200	1241840	I can't tell you anything else about what a blarg is, it has no other qualifiers.
1241840	1246040	With only what I've told you, can you pick out which object on my desk is a blarg?
1246040	1249600	The answer is no, because the word blarg conveys no meaning.
1249600	1253800	That is the problem with circular definitions, that are immediately circular, in zero steps.
1253800	1258380	It's that they relate back to no other experiences through the web of reference, and therefore
1258380	1259960	they provide no meaning.
1259960	1263060	So consider the statement, a woman is anybody who identifies as a woman.
1263060	1266280	If we were to sub out the second instance of woman there, we would get the statement,
1266280	1269220	a woman is anybody who identifies as identifying as a woman.
1269220	1272280	And then if we were to do another round of recursion, it would be, a woman is anybody
1272280	1275040	who identifies as identifying as identifying as a woman.
1275040	1278780	And this definition recurses infinitely, never getting to a point where it references
1278780	1282200	an experience, and therefore never actually containing any knowledge.
1282200	1285140	Moreover, in the real world, people don't actually do this.
1285140	1288840	A woman might be somebody who identifies as a woman, sure, but does she identify as identifying
1288840	1289840	as a woman?
1289840	1292180	Does she identify as identifying as identifying as a woman?
1292180	1293640	It simply becomes absurd.
1293640	1296640	Nobody does this, and so nobody is a woman, including trans women.
1296640	1300920	The common prague objection to this logic, simply falls back on Derrida's rafts of language.
1300920	1304160	That it's all constructed, and nothing ever gets back to anything other than words, but
1304160	1308080	that's because these people are so ideologically captured by postmodernism that they reject
1308080	1312500	the idea that meaning in language comes from the web of references that appeals to experiences
1312500	1316160	outside of the language itself, because they reject experience itself.
1316160	1318320	That's a whole can of worms I'm not going to go down right now.
1318320	1323000	If you want a taste of it though, sit back and notice just how many leftoids reject experience
1323000	1327820	a priori in favor of rationalistic planning in work, in school, in politics.
1327820	1332700	The broader left is rife with the view that having a good idea is more important than
1332700	1334260	executing good action.
1334260	1336780	But we can go even deeper.
1336780	1340500	It's not enough that the phrase, a woman is anybody who identifies as a woman, is circular
1340500	1342220	and therefore conveys no meaning.
1342220	1346420	It's not enough that attempting to find meaning in that circularity anyway results in an infinite
1346420	1349700	number of identifications that no candidate for womanhood would ever perform.
1349700	1354360	It's also that the logic itself, ignoring the circularity, is still wrong.
1354360	1355820	Consider the blarg on my desk again.
1355820	1360020	What kind of object could it possibly be, having only one quality, that of being a blarg?
1360020	1362980	What quality could possibly exist that fulfills that logic?
1362980	1365040	Put other qualities into the equation and see what I mean.
1365040	1367340	A tall person is anyone who identifies as being tall.
1367340	1368640	Well, that's obviously false.
1368640	1370620	You can be tall without identifying as being tall.
1370620	1372380	You can identify as being tall without being tall.
1372380	1373660	What about being a gamer?
1373660	1375740	You can be a gamer without identifying as being a gamer.
1375740	1378940	Then there's a person who plays video games but rejects the identity of gamer while frankly
1378940	1379940	still having it.
1379940	1381540	You can identify as being a gamer without being one.
1381540	1384060	This is the fake gamer girl who doesn't actually play games, for example.
1384060	1388060	I can be somebody who has cancer but not identify as having cancer because it's undiagnosed.
1388100	1392060	Conversely, I can identify as having cancer but not actually have cancer because I'm
1392060	1393060	a hypochondriac.
1393060	1399100	It is universal that being a thing and identifying as being a thing are not linked concepts.
1399100	1403020	Because being a thing refers back to some sort of experience-based referential knowledge
1403020	1407740	while identifying as being a thing is a product entirely of your own self-perception.
1407740	1409380	And that perception can be wrong.
1409380	1412140	Let's say that your parents told you you were born in Toronto.
1412140	1414500	As such, you identify as somebody born in Toronto.
1414500	1415780	But it turns out your parents lied.
1415780	1417020	You were actually born in Ottawa.
1417020	1421180	You may self-idea somebody born in Toronto but that self-idea is incorrect.
1421180	1424820	It doesn't map onto the real-world experience of what your life actually is.
1424820	1429060	The logic behind a woman is anybody who identifies as a woman is still wrong, independent of
1429060	1431180	any sort of circular definition problem.
1431180	1435500	Because what you identify as could be incorrect and it's impossible to have a quality that
1435500	1438060	exists only if you identify as having it.
1438060	1442060	Consider any other sort of emotion-based choice instead of identify and you'll see the same
1442060	1443260	problems pop up.
1443260	1445100	Like consider desiring instead.
1445100	1446900	Are you tall if you desire to be tall?
1446900	1447780	Obviously not.
1447780	1450020	Are you an athlete if you desire to be an athlete?
1450020	1453740	Though I will make note here that a lot of motivational inspirational perspectives put
1453740	1456060	forward the idea that you are the thing you desire.
1456060	1459980	Not because you actually are but because thinking you are is part of the mind state that helps
1459980	1461220	you accomplish the goal.
1461220	1463900	So you're not actually a professional basketball player.
1463900	1467540	But if you keep the identity of professional basketball player in your mind it may become
1467540	1471400	easier to do the day-to-day grind of actually becoming a professional basketball player.
1471400	1474900	Same with telling yourself I'm an artist to motivate yourself to create art.
1474900	1478980	The language of the fake it until you make it mentality directly mimics the I am what
1478980	1481100	I identify as attitude in the trans conversation.
1481100	1485180	But only to streamline the process of performing the real world behaviors that will actually
1485180	1488180	transform you into the thing that you're claiming to be.
1488180	1490820	Trans activists don't use the language in this way.
1490820	1495420	All that being said we're still talking about the progressives question of are all trans
1495420	1496740	women actually women?
1496740	1500380	And the self ID view fails that question spectacularly.
1500380	1503220	At first glance it seems to answer the question the way the progs want.
1503220	1506780	But as soon as you actually engage your brain and think about it even a little bit the logic
1506780	1507980	completely falls apart.
1507980	1511300	Some people will feel the need to hand wave all these objections away saying it doesn't
1511300	1515060	matter if the logic doesn't work trans women are women and whoever identifies as a woman
1515060	1516060	is one.
1516060	1517060	But that's just special pleading.
1517060	1521780	What they're really saying is I'm a-okay with this one specific domain being a place where
1521780	1525980	none of the rules of logic or language or meaning actually apply as long as it gets
1525980	1527960	me my desired political outcome.
1527960	1531820	Which is an attitude that is frankly directly in opposition to the pursuit of knowledge.
1531820	1536100	So finally here we are at the end of the progressive analysis on this question with
1536100	1539220	no answers that will ever actually satisfy the progressive.
1539220	1543800	In the taxonomic view no trans women are women because they will never produce large gametes.
1543800	1547940	In the social role view some trans women are women and some aren't while some men are also
1547940	1548940	women.
1548940	1552460	In the abolitionist view no trans women are women because women as a category and trans
1552460	1554120	women as a category don't exist.
1554120	1557560	In the prescriptive view the statement is trans women should be women but there's no
1557560	1559960	claim of whether or not trans women are women.
1559960	1564540	And in the self id view the term woman ends up being an empty word with no meaning making
1564540	1568800	everything and everyone simultaneously women and not women including a bunch of people
1568800	1572100	that the progs want explicitly not to be women like cis men.
1572100	1576160	Each of the five lenses fail to fulfill the progressives agenda when it comes to the question
1576160	1579080	of are all trans women actually women.
1579080	1580660	So what do we do now?
1580660	1582200	Personally I don't care I'm not a progressive.
1582200	1585120	I'm not chained to this requirement that all trans women be women.
1585120	1589660	I'm perfectly happy to gatekeep some people who claim to be trans women out of the label
1589660	1593800	of woman and that attitude frees us to consider two more possible positions.
1593800	1597240	The first one is that simply trans women aren't women at all.
1597240	1601660	When I talk to trans women who aren't ideologically captured by the left they generally say they're
1601660	1604960	okay with not being women they just don't want to be treated as men.
1604960	1608640	They know that they don't fulfill the taxonomy view of what a woman is but they also don't
1608640	1612780	fulfill the social role view of what a man is and in terms of that taxonomy view they're
1612780	1616700	often neuter producing no gametes depending on if they've had certain types of surgery
1616700	1618460	or how long they've been on hormones.
1618460	1623800	For them if trans woman is just its own separate thing distinct from both men and women they're
1623800	1625840	fine with that and I can see the logic here.
1625840	1629520	For example trans women have medical needs that are different from both men and women.
1629520	1632960	The attitude of I don't care what you view me as if trans women aren't women but just
1632960	1636280	its own thing fine just leave me alone so I can have my private life.
1636280	1640520	That's a pretty common view among trans women who aren't activists and to me that seems
1640520	1641960	perfectly reasonable.
1641960	1646960	Ten years ago the left had a winning argument a knockout punch on this topic and it's this
1646960	1651400	women are adult human females but to be kind and decent we should respect people's identities
1651400	1652880	in a polite society.
1652880	1656820	However there are some areas of life where biological sex should win out like for example
1656820	1657820	in women's sports.
1657820	1661580	There you go conversation over we respect the biological reality that underpins human
1661580	1665400	sexual taxonomy while understanding that in a liberal society there should be reasonable
1665400	1670060	accommodations made for the outliers also while not allowing the outliers to rule over
1670060	1671980	all of society from the margins.
1671980	1676020	This is a conception of trans acceptance that doesn't demand other people think that all
1676080	1679300	trans women are women and there's no difference between them or any other brain dead nonsense
1679300	1680300	like that.
1680300	1684340	You don't genuinely need to believe that a trans woman is a woman deep in your heart
1684340	1687320	of hearts in order for trans women to still have a place at the table.
1687320	1689240	You simply need to not be an asshole.
1689240	1693820	This was the winning leftist position 10 years ago and the left abandoned it in order to
1693820	1699180	directly defy reality and logic with the insistence that everyone else must be true believers.
1699180	1700700	For them it's not enough that you're polite.
1700700	1705280	You must view reality the exact way they do through their exact lens with their exact
1705280	1709360	logic even if it breaks or else you're a transphobe utter nonsense.
1709360	1713980	The second new position is that trans women are women but that most of the people we see
1713980	1718600	right now claiming to be trans aren't actually trans and in order to explain that I'm going
1718600	1721720	to need to explain the concept of gender dysphoria.
1721720	1724540	Actually we're like half an hour into the video and I can't believe I haven't covered
1724540	1725540	this yet.
1725540	1729340	Gender dysphoria is what we call the distress experienced by a person due to the mismatch
1729340	1731780	between their gender and their biological sex.
1731780	1735580	In this conversation biological sex is the physical reality of your body, the primary
1735580	1740400	and secondary sexual characteristics while gender is the internal feeling and experience
1740400	1741480	of that biology.
1741480	1744620	If you're a cis man in terms of your body you've got a functioning dick.
1744620	1748380	In terms of your brain you're expecting a dick to be there and to be able to do dick
1748380	1749500	things with it.
1749500	1751340	Those two things line up and you're good to go.
1751340	1755500	From what we understand so far in a person with gender dysphoria their brain is expecting
1755500	1757280	a different body to what they're hooked up to.
1757280	1760580	The common analogy used is like a computer with the wrong drivers installed.
1760580	1764660	We don't know why people experience dysphoria but there's some evidence for a lot of very
1764660	1765760	different causes.
1765760	1769080	It might be an effect of puberty which passes when puberty is complete.
1769080	1771700	It might be a side effect of depression or abuse.
1771700	1775500	It might be the result of hormonal changes within the mother that the fetus is exposed
1775500	1776500	to.
1776500	1777900	It might be a genetic abnormality.
1777900	1780680	It might be all of these things we just don't know enough yet.
1780680	1784200	And before leftoids start coping, yes this is clearly a mental illness, if you're one
1784200	1787820	of those idiots who says it's not then you have no place in this conversation.
1787820	1790820	If dysphoria isn't a mental illness that causes distress, why do people transition
1790820	1792980	to treat it then, you fucking mongoloid?
1792980	1796860	Here's the thing though, back when we discussed that social role lens, I mentioned the femme
1796860	1797860	boys.
1797860	1800080	Gay men who look, speak, and act feminine.
1800080	1803980	Who adopt a feminine gender role in their relationships and sometimes in society.
1803980	1804980	But they're not trans.
1804980	1807460	They don't view themselves as women, they're still men.
1807460	1808460	They're just feminine men.
1808460	1810580	They don't fit into this view of gender dysphoria.
1810580	1815940	And that's probably why so many trans activists out there end up being toxic as fuck egg hatchers
1815940	1818460	trying to push feminine men into being trans.
1818460	1822780	Because femme boys are a giant red flag that our current understanding of gender dysphoria
1822780	1824340	doesn't quite make sense.
1824340	1828080	This is just my personal theory, I only have my intuition to go on here.
1828080	1831700	But I've spoken to a bunch of trans women at this point, and I've asked them all.
1831700	1836340	If they could wake up tomorrow as cis women with a real vagina and uterus and ovaries,
1836340	1839900	and an annoying monthly cycle, and the chromosomes and all the rest of it, they would.
1839900	1843440	To me that sounds like what they're experiencing isn't gender dysphoria, it's better described
1843440	1844440	as sex dysphoria.
1844440	1847200	It's not that trans women want to be women, that's only a part of it.
1847200	1849120	They want to be female from birth.
1849120	1851440	They literally want to be adult human females.
1851440	1855520	They can't be, obviously, but transitioning and becoming more female-like is how they
1855520	1858200	alleviate the stress of not being female.
1858200	1861180	The social role stuff, the passing, the behavior, that's all part of it.
1861180	1864000	And they take what they can get, but the thing they really want, the thing that is forever
1864000	1865760	out of reach, is the biology.
1865760	1868940	This is why the social role view is part of it, but it's not enough.
1868940	1871000	What does it mean to feel being female?
1871000	1874680	Is it liking to cook, or liking the color pink, or being attracted to masculine men?
1874680	1877360	A lot of women are like that, but a lot of gay men are like that too.
1877360	1881860	There's still that biological component in feeling a deep mismatch between your mind
1881860	1882860	and your body.
1882860	1887000	I know it's not exactly the female brain in a male body analogy.
1887000	1890720	We've got some evidence through brain scans that trans women's brains straddle the space
1890720	1894000	between cis men and cis women, and the whole topic is way more complicated.
1894000	1896120	But that view works for this conversation.
1896120	1898860	Additionally, the taxonomy view isn't enough either.
1898860	1901740	Let's say that you're somebody who is a strict believer in the woman is an adult
1901740	1902900	human female thing.
1902900	1906420	Okay, when you see a person who looks like a woman at the grocery store, what exactly
1906420	1909640	are you going to do before you decide to call them sir or ma'am?
1909640	1912060	Are you going to test her gametes where you treat her like a woman?
1912060	1915020	Most of us don't get to verify that sort of thing in a public setting, unless you're
1915020	1916020	pretty creepy.
1916020	1920500	Even for people who claim to follow a strictly biological lens in this conversation, in casual
1920500	1924740	situations, they will still put on the social role lens, just because it's quicker and
1924740	1925740	easier.
1925740	1929140	It's also just so funny to listen to Ben Shapiro on Joe Rogan intuitively call Blair
1929140	1933220	White she, and then immediately forcing himself to say he in order to try and maintain his
1933220	1934340	political position.
1934340	1939040	In normal day to day living, most people forget about biology and default to some version
1939040	1941760	of the social role view in casual circumstances.
1941760	1944420	If they look like a woman, then they are one, and if they don't, they don't.
1944420	1947220	You see a lady in a dress with long hair, looks pretty feminine, you're not going
1947220	1950260	to ask a question about biology, you're going to assume, oh, that's a woman.
1950260	1954440	This might suck for people who can't pass, but it is how the majority of people function.
1954440	1959000	If dysphoria is the issue, and it's not just going away with time or alleviation of
1959000	1962840	other problems, then we have two choices, make the brain more masculine, or make the
1962840	1965560	body more feminine, to bring the two in line.
1965560	1970880	And so far, it seems like making the brain more masculine is way, way tougher than making
1970880	1972140	the body more feminine.
1972140	1977080	A lot of people on the right say these people need help, not transitioning, failing to realize
1977080	1979120	that transitioning is the help.
1979120	1984160	Success rates for various forms of therapy to masculinize the brain are abysmal.
1984160	1988760	Way worse than the success rates to feminize the body, which frankly already aren't great.
1988760	1992680	But all of this is only legitimate if the dysphoria is both present and unchanging.
1992680	1996280	There's a new wave of trans activism which declares, as a natural end result of that
1996280	2000560	self-ID view, that you don't even need dysphoria to be trans, you just need to identify as
2000560	2001560	being trans.
2001560	2005240	Nowadays, if you believe that dysphoria is required, then you're a transmedicalist,
2005240	2008440	which is a negative word used to describe people who think that being trans is fundamentally
2008440	2009440	a medical phenomenon.
2009440	2013260	But the people who believe that you don't need dysphoria to be trans are probably the
2013260	2017220	single dumbest group I've spoken about in this video more than any other.
2017220	2019960	If you can simply identify as another gender, then why transition at all?
2019960	2023180	Just identify as the gender associated with your birth sex and dysphoria goes away lol,
2023180	2024780	obviously that's not how it works.
2024780	2029260	The issue ultimately is, if we take the entire class of people that the progs would call
2029260	2032860	trans women, we see within it, broadly, two categories.
2032860	2037300	In the first category we see people who, even though they're biologically male, they have
2037300	2040420	an affinity for femininity that goes beyond free will.
2040420	2044260	They've been like this their whole lives, and they can't choose not to be.
2044260	2049100	For them, nothing works, nothing alleviates their pain, with the exception of transitioning.
2049100	2052060	They have something more, something deeper than just identification.
2052060	2056560	They have a female essence in their body language, in their behavior, in the way that they speak,
2056560	2060320	that is, unfortunately, at war with their own male biology.
2060320	2063660	In the second category, we see people who have chosen to identify as women, and if you
2063660	2065360	don't accept their self-ID, you're a bigot.
2065360	2068920	There's no feminine essence to appeal to here, there's no sense that they can't help but
2068920	2071740	be in this unfortunate situation, there's only narcissism.
2071740	2076440	If there is truly a place for trans women to actually be women, it's going to be along
2076440	2077440	these lines.
2077440	2082120	The feminine essence that they can't help but embody, that shows itself not as a self-ID,
2082120	2083920	but as an uncontrollable affinity.
2083920	2088760	The issue is, ultimately, that the self-ID view of this topic is just the gender abolitionist
2088760	2090440	view in disguise.
2090440	2094760	Self-ID advocates know that their politics, if ever widely adopted, destroys gender as
2094760	2095760	a concept.
2095760	2099360	Either way, the TERFs are correct when they say that trans activists want to destroy the
2099360	2100520	concept of women.
2100520	2103880	The two positions outside of the progressive framework are, ironically enough, the two
2103880	2106520	most pro-trans coherent positions.
2106520	2109920	The first, where trans women aren't women, and that's fine because they're also not men.
2109920	2113720	The second, where people who have an innate and uncontrollable affinity towards female
2113720	2115080	biology are women.
2115080	2119080	The second one includes all cis women and all trans women who have gender dysphoria,
2119080	2122480	but it excludes all of the trans trenders, all the people who say you don't need dysphoria
2122480	2125300	to be trans, all the people who do it because it's a trendy aesthetic.
2125300	2127200	All of those people aren't women.
2127200	2132100	This is the only logically coherent framework by which at least some trans women are women
2132100	2133740	that also excludes men.
2133740	2139020	This is the most pro-trans position possible that actually makes sense, and the progs reject
2139020	2140020	it.
2140020	2143180	They would rather wreck the concept of woman entirely than compromise and get at least
2143180	2147500	some of their stated goals, because their actual goal is to wreck the concept of woman.
2147500	2152540	But to somebody who isn't ideologically captured by leftism, both of these positions are reasonable
2152540	2153540	compromises.
2153540	2157900	I find that off Twitter, off campus, and off the left, most trans people just want to chill
2157900	2158900	and be left alone.
2158900	2161500	They're not going to demand that you religiously believe that they're women.
2161500	2164460	They're just going to want you to be polite to them if you have to interact, and not shout
2164460	2168080	at them in the middle of the store because they can't pass or you clock them or something.
2168080	2169080	And you know what?
2169080	2170980	That's a perfectly reasonable thing to want.
2170980	2174340	So to answer the question once and for all, are trans women actually women?
2174340	2178100	In almost all views, the answer is necessarily no.
2178100	2181880	There is a view that allows some people who claim to be trans women to be women, but there
2181880	2184720	is no view that allows all trans women to be women.
2184720	2188160	And progressives reject the most coherent trans-positive position, not because they
2188160	2192520	want to include more trans people in the acceptance, but because trans people are simply their
2192520	2197040	political pawns, and they are happy to use, abuse, and discard them as such.
