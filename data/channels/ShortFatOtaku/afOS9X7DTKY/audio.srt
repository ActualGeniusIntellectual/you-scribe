1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,060
It's finally time I tackled this subject.

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,760
I talked about it briefly on the most recent sip, and realized that I should get my thoughts

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,220
on this topic down in some sort of thought-out, pre-scripted, organized way, without garbling

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,540
it on stream, because that's how I roll.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,420
So let's finally examine the question, are trans women actually women?

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,260
Well, let's focus on the specifics, namely what we mean when we ask the question, are

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,580
trans women women, and what lens we're using to try and discover an answer to the question.

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,500
Conservatives tend to rely on the intuitive answer here, a simple no, often coupled with

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,320
the pithier mark, define woman.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,180
The conservative position here is that woman is defined as adult human female, because

11
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,300
trans women are adult human males, they can't be women.

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,200
Conservatives generally leave it here because the logic is compact and punchy.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,540
But let's actually analyze what makes this view operate.

14
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,700
This is where we get to the first lens, the taxonomy view of biological sex.

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,340
Taxonomy is the science of classification, how we organize a bunch of separate things

16
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,500
into groups of things.

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,020
We use it for libraries, for computers, for finance.

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,380
But important to us right now is biological taxonomy, specifically sexual taxonomy.

19
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,940
I'll just cut right to the heart of it.

20
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,160
When it comes to biological life on earth, we identify males as members of a species

21
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,140
that produces small gametes, which is almost always some type of sperm, and we identify

22
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,880
females as members of the species that produces large gametes, which is almost always some

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,880
type of egg.

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,900
There are some single-celled organisms that reproduce either by cell fission or instead

25
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,880
by swapping gametes, but they're so small that the gametes are the same size, meaning

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,860
neither is really male or female.

27
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,200
But those are exceptions.

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,180
Once we move beyond primitive cellular life, it's all about gamete sizes.

29
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,180
It's not about chromosomes.

30
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,320
A lot of people like to say it's either XX or XY.

31
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,520
But birds, fish, and snakes all have a ZW chrominal system, and yet they still have

32
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,760
males and females.

33
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,120
Some bugs and bats have an XO system, moths have a ZO system.

34
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,700
The point is that chromosomes aren't enough.

35
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,860
Even in humans, somebody can have abnormal chromosomes and still produce large or small

36
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,860
gametes.

37
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,520
It's not about who has what genitals, it's not about hormones, it's not about who does

38
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,900
the penetrating or who carries the child or who raises.

39
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,860
Throw all that out the window, it's irrelevant.

40
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,400
Sexual taxonomy is determined by the size of the gametes you produce.

41
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,740
Almost every species has males and females corresponding to producing small and large

42
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,160
gametes respectively.

43
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,380
Some species, like earthworms and snails, and a lot of plants, are hermaphroditic, meaning

44
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,620
they produce both small and large gametes at the same time.

45
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,660
In humans, there are intersex people, but it still comes down to what gametes, if any,

46
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,660
they produce.

47
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,380
So far, there's been zero documented cases of any human ever producing both sets of gametes.

48
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,220
With that being said, let's move on.

49
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,940
Consider cattle as a species.

50
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,300
Adult males of the species, meaning cattle that can produce small gametes, are called

51
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,340
bulls.

52
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,380
Adult females, cattle that can produce large gametes, are called cows.

53
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,860
Immature cattle are called calves.

54
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,860
An immature male, meaning a cattle that cannot yet produce small gametes but will once he

55
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,980
matures, is a bull calf, while an immature female is a heifer.

56
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,300
But here's where it gets interesting.

57
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,940
A castrated male, meaning a cattle that could produce small gametes but has a sexual organ

58
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,860
surgically removed, is an ox.

59
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,900
Oxen are preferable for labor over bulls, being easier to control.

60
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,020
You'll find a similar naming convention among a lot of animal species, at least in English.

61
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,020
Here's another quick example.

62
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,860
For deer, adult males are bucks or stags, depending on the species.

63
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,500
Adult females are generally does.

64
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,540
Children are generally fawns or kids, depending on species and gender.

65
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,540
A sterilized deer is a Javier.

66
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,800
Natural taxonomy commonly breaks out into these five classifications, all revolving

67
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,160
around gamete production.

68
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,020
Immature male, immature female, mature male, mature female, and neuter.

69
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,460
In a taxonomic sense, there's no reason that humans would be different than any other

70
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,520
animal on Earth.

71
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,940
We have children who cannot yet produce gametes but will, boys and girls.

72
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,300
We have adults who do produce gametes, men and women.

73
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,180
And we have people who can't produce gametes anymore, eunuchs.

74
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,820
This schema also applies to intersex and trans people, based on if they produce large gametes,

75
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,940
small gametes, or no gametes.

76
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,980
So if we're examining the question of, are trans women actually women, through the lens

77
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,020
of human sexual taxonomy, the answer is no.

78
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,420
They might produce small gametes, making them men.

79
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,020
They might produce no gametes, making them eunuchs.

80
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,620
But until we're living in the transhumanist future, where trans women can have a fully

81
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,260
functioning uterus and ovaries transplanted into them, they can never produce large gametes,

82
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,780
meaning they can never be women.

83
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,720
But to some, this is an offensive answer.

84
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
Humans aren't like animals.

85
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,180
We can't use biological sexual classification standards on us, the same way that we use

86
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,180
them on every other species.

87
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,420
For people, okay, fair enough.

88
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:22,140
There are other lenses beyond the taxonomy one that are worth considering.

89
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,660
Another widely held lens is the social role view.

90
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,220
The idea here is that a woman is a person who takes on a socially feminine function,

91
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,900
or behaves and presents in a socially feminine manner, or is treated by others in a feminine

92
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,900
way.

93
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,860
Okay, on this surface, this seems like a fine trans inclusive lens to view the problem with.

94
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,220
And there are at least a few pro-trans feminists over the years who have agreed with this view.

95
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,780
But the more we dig into it, the more problems we begin to unearth.

96
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,340
Firstly, what do we mean by taking on a socially feminine function or behaving and presenting

97
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,860
in a socially feminine manner?

98
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,780
It's very tough to define what this means in any sort of universal way, like the taxonomy

99
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,600
view manages to, especially considering differences in the feminine gender role across culture

100
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
and time.

101
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,900
But let's just hand wave that and say, you know, whatever passes for feminine right now

102
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,300
in our culture or something.

103
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,620
Let's say that we've discovered the universal feminine gender role.

104
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,100
There's still a problem here though, and that has to do with the framing of the question.

105
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,500
When a progressive is seeking for the answer to the question, are trans women actually

106
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
women?

107
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,460
What they're actually looking for is an answer to the question, are all trans women

108
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,460
women?

109
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,700
Meaning more specifically, they are seeking a definition of woman that includes all cis

110
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,580
women and all trans women, but no cis men or trans men.

111
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,780
That is what they require in their fully inclusive definition.

112
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,940
Not a single trans woman is left behind.

113
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,320
Does the social role view provide the answer the Prague is looking for?

114
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,060
Unfortunately for them, no.

115
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,380
Regardless of what social role we pin down and say, this is the social role you can adopt

116
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,380
to become a woman.

117
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,740
It still doesn't include all trans women and exclude all men.

118
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,500
There are absolutely extremely submissive men who would take on this feminine gender

119
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
role.

120
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,500
They might even call themselves girl.

121
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,660
That's a thing in the gay community for sure, but they don't actually consider themselves

122
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,660
women.

123
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,780
In the same vein, there are absolutely trans women who would not adopt this gender role.

124
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,820
Maybe because they're not out of the closet yet, maybe it's because they don't pass

125
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,100
or they never will pass.

126
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,580
Hell, there's both trans women and cis women who are very masculine presenting, the

127
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,420
butch lesbian types, and they might say things like, women don't owe you femininity.

128
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,740
That's a pretty common feminist sentiment, in fact.

129
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,180
The problem with the social role view is that trans women who don't perform the role would

130
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:24,220
not be considered women, while men who do perform the role would be forced to be women,

131
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,560
and the Progs can't stand for that.

132
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,040
Some of the more radical activists on the left, both trans and not, have adopted the

133
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,500
gender abolitionist lens on the topic.

134
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,540
For these people, they want to abolish the concept of gender itself.

135
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,380
In their ideal world, there is no more man or woman.

136
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,760
Gender is a dead concept.

137
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,100
Nobody knows what it means anymore.

138
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,300
Nobody has the language to describe a difference between a man and a woman.

139
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,220
Nobody can recognize the difference between men and women.

140
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,140
The human race is all just made up of people who look different from each other.

141
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,660
In this view, definitionally, no trans woman can be women, because there are no women anymore.

142
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,940
There are no trans women anymore, too, ignoring the stupidity of this position.

143
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,020
Even if we take it at face value, the progressives' quest to find a definition of woman that includes

144
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,340
all trans women is not fulfilled here, because this framework doesn't have a definition

145
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,420
of woman at all.

146
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,920
It honestly becomes truly incredible to watch a trans woman take this position in real time,

147
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,900
because it's in complete conflict with the view that nobody is ever socially conditioned

148
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,900
into being trans.

149
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,420
That's all just conservatives basically calling people groomers.

150
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,460
Except by the abolitionists' own logic, everybody is socially conditioned into being

151
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,460
trans.

152
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,820
There's also the prescriptive lens.

153
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,360
Within this framework, the question is reframed as an affirmative statement.

154
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,440
Trans women are women isn't a description of reality, but a prescription of what we

155
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,680
want reality to be.

156
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,600
Kinda like people who hold up signs saying healthcare is a human right.

157
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,400
Within a natural rights framework, healthcare is not a right, but even ignoring that, even

158
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,280
taking the view that rights flow from the state.

159
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,540
In a state where healthcare isn't a right, the statement healthcare is a human right

160
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,720
is definitionally false.

161
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,280
But they're using it as a prescription, not a description.

162
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,540
And the same goes for trans women are women here.

163
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,820
In essence, what they're saying is trans women should be women.

164
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,480
The argument for this is ultimately going to be based in utility, in good consequences.

165
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,640
That society is better off if trans women are women than if trans women aren't women.

166
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,080
So trans women should be women.

167
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,920
We're going to have to dive into the postmodernist commie gobbledygook, but let's actually

168
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,140
consider this logic.

169
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,000
The postmodernists are correct when they say that our language is as it is because it serves

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
some function.

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,840
I think it was the father of postmodernism, the French philosopher Derrida, who described

172
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,520
language as a series of rafts in the ocean that we never actually leave to get to shore.

173
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,300
I don't know, I haven't read this guy's stuff since university.

174
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,440
The postmodernists are correct when they say that our language is as it is, not because

175
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,880
it's immutable, but because it serves some utility to us.

176
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,600
For example, when I say the word water, there's three separate things wrapped up in there.

177
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,400
There's the word water, which is itself meaningless, it's just a word.

178
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,920
A person who doesn't know my language, who hears me say water, is just going to hear

179
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
random sounds.

180
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,260
Then there's the concept of water, which is what I'm thinking of in my head when I

181
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,260
say water.

182
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,040
And when I say to you, this is water, I'm hoping you have the same concept in your head

183
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,740
of water that I do, so that I'm conveying to you not just the sound of the word, but

184
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,300
the meaning that I intend.

185
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,240
And then there's actually the physical substance that is water, the clear, tasteless, odorless

186
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,540
liquid that is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

187
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,560
That substance, the substance of water, I can never truly get to it with language alone.

188
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,900
I just described it to you there, but it's not like water poured over your headphones

189
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
or something.

190
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,060
Description of the thing is not the thing itself, and the only way to know water is

191
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,380
to experience water beyond language.

192
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,840
There are even some more hardcore postmodernists called anti-realists who think that it's

193
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,520
impossible to know water even if you touch it or taste it because your senses are still

194
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,320
subjective and a product of your own mind, and that there's no real world beyond human

195
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
perception.

196
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,800
But if you're going to go down the ultimate skeptic rabbit hole, all of reality breaks

197
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,200
down and it's honestly pretty retarded because nobody actually lives their life that way.

198
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,640
In my opinion, there does seem to be a world beyond human perception of it, and words can

199
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,040
convey meaning without truly knowing that world.

200
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,680
We called water, water, long before we knew what hydrogen and oxygen was.

201
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,380
And yet, the meaning remained even as we learned more about what it was.

202
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,620
Sometimes meanings change with new knowledge, but nonetheless it does seem to be the case

203
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,900
that a lot of language does at least point to something real even if it's not the thing

204
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,900
itself.

205
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,040
So, the prescriptive view of gender is, if all of language is this postmodernist series

206
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,060
of rafts, and we construct it all to point at real world phenomenon in a way that is

207
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,220
useful to us, then we should construct woman to include transwoman.

208
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,500
The issue is that useful for us part.

209
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,520
The taxonomy view that we discussed back at the start of the video is actually the

210
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,220
natural end result of this prescriptivist view.

211
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,360
We find it useful to classify different types of a species by their reproductive capability,

212
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,940
and man and woman for humans is no different.

213
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,420
Most men, when they say that they are romantically attracted to women, they have packed into

214
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,280
that label, biologically female, capable of having heterosexual sex, capable of carrying

215
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,600
children, and transwomen can't do any of that.

216
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,560
The common Prague reply at this point is, would you say that a woman who can't carry

217
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,800
children isn't a woman?

218
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,640
The truth is, believe it or not, a lot of people, both men and women, do consider that

219
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
to be the case.

220
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,120
Like, it sucks, it's a shitty reality, I'm sure it's offensive to many people.

221
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,120
But the human taxonomy view views these people as neuter, and for most of human history we've

222
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,300
had no problem saying it.

223
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,160
And this is where the social engineering part of the conversation comes into play.

224
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,820
If leftoids can push the culture into a position where most people no longer find utility in

225
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:17,060
using gender in this way, then the prescriptive view of gender would necessarily desync with

226
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,060
the taxonomic view.

227
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,740
That's why it's prescriptive, it's saying we should do this, it's a moral statement,

228
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,860
not a statement of fact.

229
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,500
But that's a problem for the Prague if we're talking about the question, are transwomen

230
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
actually women?

231
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,180
The prescriptive answer is, they're not, and they should be, but that's still a no.

232
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,260
And it always will be until we reach a point that the majority culture no longer cares

233
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,540
about biological sex when it comes to finding a partner.

234
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,540
And frankly I wouldn't hold my breath on that one.

235
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,380
So, when the progressive seeks to find a definition of woman that includes all transwomen, while

236
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,940
excluding all men, nothing seems to fit.

237
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,780
The taxonomy view says that none of them are.

238
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,500
The social role view includes some trans women, but not all of them, and it includes some

239
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
men too.

240
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,340
The abolitionist view says no because there are no women at all.

241
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,220
The prescriptive view also says no, but it focuses on what should be, rather than what

242
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,460
the truth actually is.

243
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,420
It's at this point the progressive falls into the ultimately arbitrary position that

244
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,820
is necessarily the end result of the social engineering deep within the prescriptive view,

245
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,980
the self-identification lens.

246
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,020
Most people who consider the prescriptive view end up abandoning utility once they recognize

247
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:19,860
that most people actually find a lot of utility in differentiation based on reproductive ability,

248
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,580
so they abandon utility in favor of harm reduction.

249
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,060
At this point it doesn't matter what the objective truth is, or if it even exists.

250
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,920
It doesn't matter if some people prefer the current definitions.

251
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,760
If we are the ones that can choose what all this shit means, we should just open the doors

252
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,060
and let everybody identify as what they want to minimize the harm that comes with gatekeeping.

253
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,820
Therefore the self-ID lens is one where anybody who self-identifies as a woman is a woman.

254
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,780
There are no qualifiers other than identification.

255
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,580
On the surface, it seems like the question, are trans women actually women, is definitionally

256
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,580
true now.

257
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,900
They are women because we've defined them as women, and if there are any trans women

258
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,340
out there who don't make the cut by some other metric, don't worry about it, because

259
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,380
we've completely unmoored the concept of woman from any measurable metric.

260
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,780
It's simply a class that you can belong to by virtue of identifying as belonging to it.

261
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,140
Now a conservative would immediately say, this is a circular definition.

262
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,140
You see this a lot.

263
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,140
Define woman.

264
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,140
Anyone who identifies as a woman.

265
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,140
You can't use the word in its own definition.

266
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,140
That's circular.

267
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,140
And this is true.

268
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:21,220
The definition of woman is a person that identifies as such.

269
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,260
What does such refer to here in your sentence, you brainlet?

270
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,820
You haven't actually changed anything.

271
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,140
You've just subbed out woman for a variable that directly means a woman and brings nothing

272
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,140
else to the table.

273
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,140
It's still circular.

274
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,220
You're just too dumb to recognize it.

275
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,060
But often the conservative stops thinking here and says, aha, I'm correct.

276
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,220
It is circular, but let's keep going.

277
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,940
Let's examine exactly what the problem is.

278
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,660
These issues are deliberately ignorant to the point that they're not capable of talking

279
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,400
about any of these issues.

280
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,700
Can you go over circular arguments like real quick?

281
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,700
There's no such thing.

282
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,100
Guys, there is no reason a definition can't be circular.

283
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,340
Not that my definition of woman is, but it doesn't have to be people like people start

284
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,220
pretending there were all these like rules about what a definition can be.

285
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,100
There aren't words can mean literally anything.

286
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,220
The reason we choose definitions and use them is to serve utility, but they never get to

287
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,220
that point.

288
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,020
I wish I could get to that point in an argument with a conservative.

289
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,300
I'm sure Vosch considers me a conservative.

290
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,700
And for your sake, buddy, because I like you a lot, I am happy to directly engage with

291
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,700
your question.

292
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,920
He's partially correct.

293
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,560
This is Derrida's observation of language being a series of raffs again.

294
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,780
But on the other hand, you can de tallo the neutalov until it reached Parkst, then keep

295
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,040
the part that was both Tenir and Hoch.

296
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,820
Is the ton woe Roy or Beccafroy?

297
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,860
What did I just ask you there?

298
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,080
What meaning did I just convey to you?

299
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,620
Language can mean anything, but it does have to mean something that we all agree upon in

300
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,620
order to be useful.

301
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,100
Otherwise, it's just individuals using their own private languages that aren't actually

302
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,840
communicating any meaning.

303
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Here's the thing.

304
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,400
Any highly complicated class that involves multiple traits is actually really hard to

305
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
define.

306
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
For example, what's a chair?

307
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,600
Four legs with a seat in the back that people sit on?

308
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,400
I mean, yeah, but that's also a horse.

309
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
What's a car?

310
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Something with wheels?

311
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
Is a truck a car?

312
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Maybe.

313
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Is a motorcycle a car?

314
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,520
Well, if it needs more than two wheels, how about a motorcycle with a sidecar?

315
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,960
How about a car with three wheels?

316
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,880
How about a broken car with no wheels?

317
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,020
If it needs an engine, is a lawnmower a car?

318
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,720
If it needs to run on gas, is an electric car a car?

319
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,600
If an electric car actually is a car, is a golf cart a car?

320
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,480
Every single definition for every classification has fuzzy edges, and frankly, gender, even

321
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,460
sex is no different.

322
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,560
Male and female are still categories that we made up.

323
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,880
It's not like the word male or female is printed on our cells if you zoom in with a microscope.

324
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,380
XX and XY might be there, sure, but again, it's possible for an XX person to produce

325
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,980
small gametes, even though the overwhelming majority of them produce large gametes, and

326
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,460
vice versa for an XY.

327
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,360
We notice that organisms produce small gametes, large gametes, or no gametes, but we still

328
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,660
choose to use that as a basis for our classification of male, female, and neuter.

329
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,880
When we're talking about man and woman, we notice a collection of traits.

330
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,720
We notice that they largely fit into two groups, and we notice that identifying those groups

331
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,660
as two separate things brings us utility.

332
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,440
Consider type 2 diabetes, you know, the type that I probably have.

333
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,020
It's ultimately arbitrary that we choose a certain amount of insulin resistance to

334
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,520
qualify for diabetic, prediabetic, and not diabetic at all.

335
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,680
It could have been a few percentage points different either way, but nonetheless, the

336
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,800
label of diabetic obviously brings us some utility, and it does point at something real,

337
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,400
even if its barriers are constructed by us.

338
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,800
This is the deep problem with Vosch's position.

339
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,120
He says that everything is just a social construct, and that's true, but then he says that because

340
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,440
everything is a social construct, therefore we can just make everything the way we want

341
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,200
it to be, and that is false.

342
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,080
One, it requires broad consensus to truly change the meaning of language, not just bullying

343
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,040
a dictionary into compliance by ratioing them on Twitter.

344
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,080
And two, we have the language that we do because that language points at something in reality.

345
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,380
It is constructed, but it's not really arbitrary.

346
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:51,120
It's the result of our observations of the world, and even if we do observe edge cases,

347
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,560
exceptions generally prove the rule.

348
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,440
Additionally, when we're talking about gender and sex, the edge cases aren't trans people,

349
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,400
they're intersex people, and it's frankly annoying when trans activists coop intersex

350
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,760
talking points to try and legitimize their views.

351
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:08,120
So, when Vosch says there's no reason definitions can't be circular, he's referring to Derrida's

352
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
rafts.

353
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,120
And fair enough.

354
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,440
If you dig deep enough, all definitions are circular.

355
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,080
Quick example, in the Oxford Dictionary, what is a woman, an adult female human being?

356
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,080
What's a female?

357
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,860
Of or denoting the sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs, distinguished biologically

358
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,880
by the production of large gametes.

359
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,440
What's a gamete, a male or female cell that joins with the cell of the opposite sex to

360
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,440
form a zygote?

361
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,120
Well, we've circled back around a female again.

362
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
What's a zygote?

363
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,400
A cell that develops into a person or an animal, formed by the joining together of a male and

364
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
female gamete.

365
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,400
It's very common to find definitions that circle back in on themselves in a few steps.

366
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,360
The issue is whether or not the interlocking web of circular references ever actually communicates

367
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,680
any meaning through the act of referencing.

368
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
Here's what I mean.

369
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,380
Let's say that you've never felt the softness of a newborn baby's skin.

370
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,380
I haven't.

371
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,380
I've heard it soft.

372
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,240
So, because I've never felt it, when you tell me that it feels soft, that doesn't

373
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
really help me too much.

374
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,920
It might help me a bit if I know what soft is, but I have no idea how soft it is.

375
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,440
But if you were to tell me, it's softer than silk, because I know how soft silk feels.

376
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,180
I am now a lot closer at understanding what you're saying.

377
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,520
This idea is probably best described in Frank Jackson's thought experiment, Mary's Room,

378
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,820
where Mary is a scientist who has lived her entire life in a black and white room.

379
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,440
During that time, she studied everything there is to know about the color red, all scientific

380
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,040
data anyone's ever written about, all descriptions in prose, everything humanity's ever documented

381
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,200
about the color red.

382
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,440
She's even seen black and white pictures and video of everything that's ever existed,

383
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,120
but she's never seen the color red herself.

384
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,320
When Mary leaves the black and white room and sees the color red for the first time,

385
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,520
does that experience, experiencing what red actually looks like, constitute new knowledge?

386
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,000
To me, the answer seems to be yes.

387
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,920
The experience of red itself cannot be rationalistically described, but it's still a form of knowledge

388
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,480
missing in the verbal and written descriptions of what red is.

389
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,680
The point of the Mary's Room thought experiment is that experience is a form of knowledge

390
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,020
that you can't directly get at through language, but language combined with experience can

391
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,220
lead to new knowledge on the edges of your understanding.

392
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,480
That's the softer than silk comment from earlier.

393
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,860
Somebody like Mary with all of her rational knowledge, after experiencing the colors red

394
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,580
and blue for herself, might be able to say red is like blue, but it has these differences.

395
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,800
Her ability to describe those differences are fleshed out by her rational knowledge,

396
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,200
but the experience of seeing them forms the foundation.

397
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,920
Putting it simply, although Derrida is correct that we never leave the rafts of language,

398
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,680
that doesn't mean that we're not in sight of the shoreline.

399
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,120
Language is circular, but it's the web of references combined with our own experience

400
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,280
that allows us to express meaning.

401
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,600
So when Vosch says something like, it doesn't matter if it's circular, anything can be

402
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,440
anything, and we're going down the self-ID rabbit hole where the word woman has no qualifiers

403
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,300
attached, no experience in the real world is necessary to provide the foundation for

404
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,560
knowledge to exist.

405
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,120
What does woman mean?

406
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,520
It seems to be an empty word.

407
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,540
Maybe that's why the UN defines woman as limitless and formless, but that also means

408
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,900
that no meaning is communicated when you say the word woman.

409
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,260
If we're going by this standard, the word woman means nothing at all, and if it's

410
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,480
a word without meaning, then everything and anything and nothing can be a woman, or not

411
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,480
be.

412
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,400
The progressive search for a definition of woman that includes all trans women but no

413
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,340
men necessarily falls apart here, because everything, including men, are simultaneously

414
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,800
women and not women.

415
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,560
But let's continue down the rabbit hole anyway, just in case you're not convinced

416
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,560
yet.

417
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,520
Let's say that on my desk I have all sorts of knick-knacks.

418
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,200
My wallet, my phone, my headphones, books, pens, old receipts, Funko Pop statues, you

419
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,700
know, random assorted junk.

420
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,000
And now let's say that I tell you on my desk I have an object known as a blarg.

421
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,200
Blargs are only identified by one feature, that is, the feature of being a blarg.

422
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,840
I can't tell you anything else about what a blarg is, it has no other qualifiers.

423
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,040
With only what I've told you, can you pick out which object on my desk is a blarg?

424
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,600
The answer is no, because the word blarg conveys no meaning.

425
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,800
That is the problem with circular definitions, that are immediately circular, in zero steps.

426
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,380
It's that they relate back to no other experiences through the web of reference, and therefore

427
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,960
they provide no meaning.

428
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,060
So consider the statement, a woman is anybody who identifies as a woman.

429
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,280
If we were to sub out the second instance of woman there, we would get the statement,

430
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,220
a woman is anybody who identifies as identifying as a woman.

431
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,280
And then if we were to do another round of recursion, it would be, a woman is anybody

432
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,040
who identifies as identifying as identifying as a woman.

433
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,780
And this definition recurses infinitely, never getting to a point where it references

434
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,200
an experience, and therefore never actually containing any knowledge.

435
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,140
Moreover, in the real world, people don't actually do this.

436
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,840
A woman might be somebody who identifies as a woman, sure, but does she identify as identifying

437
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,840
as a woman?

438
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,180
Does she identify as identifying as identifying as a woman?

439
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,640
It simply becomes absurd.

440
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,640
Nobody does this, and so nobody is a woman, including trans women.

441
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,920
The common prague objection to this logic, simply falls back on Derrida's rafts of language.

442
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,160
That it's all constructed, and nothing ever gets back to anything other than words, but

443
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,080
that's because these people are so ideologically captured by postmodernism that they reject

444
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,500
the idea that meaning in language comes from the web of references that appeals to experiences

445
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,160
outside of the language itself, because they reject experience itself.

446
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,320
That's a whole can of worms I'm not going to go down right now.

447
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,000
If you want a taste of it though, sit back and notice just how many leftoids reject experience

448
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,820
a priori in favor of rationalistic planning in work, in school, in politics.

449
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:12,700
The broader left is rife with the view that having a good idea is more important than

450
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,260
executing good action.

451
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,780
But we can go even deeper.

452
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,500
It's not enough that the phrase, a woman is anybody who identifies as a woman, is circular

453
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,220
and therefore conveys no meaning.

454
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,420
It's not enough that attempting to find meaning in that circularity anyway results in an infinite

455
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,700
number of identifications that no candidate for womanhood would ever perform.

456
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,360
It's also that the logic itself, ignoring the circularity, is still wrong.

457
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,820
Consider the blarg on my desk again.

458
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,020
What kind of object could it possibly be, having only one quality, that of being a blarg?

459
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,980
What quality could possibly exist that fulfills that logic?

460
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,040
Put other qualities into the equation and see what I mean.

461
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,340
A tall person is anyone who identifies as being tall.

462
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,640
Well, that's obviously false.

463
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,620
You can be tall without identifying as being tall.

464
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,380
You can identify as being tall without being tall.

465
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,660
What about being a gamer?

466
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,740
You can be a gamer without identifying as being a gamer.

467
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,940
Then there's a person who plays video games but rejects the identity of gamer while frankly

468
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,940
still having it.

469
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,540
You can identify as being a gamer without being one.

470
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,060
This is the fake gamer girl who doesn't actually play games, for example.

471
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:08,060
I can be somebody who has cancer but not identify as having cancer because it's undiagnosed.

472
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,060
Conversely, I can identify as having cancer but not actually have cancer because I'm

473
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,060
a hypochondriac.

474
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:19,100
It is universal that being a thing and identifying as being a thing are not linked concepts.

475
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,020
Because being a thing refers back to some sort of experience-based referential knowledge

476
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,740
while identifying as being a thing is a product entirely of your own self-perception.

477
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,380
And that perception can be wrong.

478
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,140
Let's say that your parents told you you were born in Toronto.

479
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,500
As such, you identify as somebody born in Toronto.

480
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,780
But it turns out your parents lied.

481
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,020
You were actually born in Ottawa.

482
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:41,180
You may self-idea somebody born in Toronto but that self-idea is incorrect.

483
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,820
It doesn't map onto the real-world experience of what your life actually is.

484
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:49,060
The logic behind a woman is anybody who identifies as a woman is still wrong, independent of

485
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,180
any sort of circular definition problem.

486
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,500
Because what you identify as could be incorrect and it's impossible to have a quality that

487
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,060
exists only if you identify as having it.

488
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,060
Consider any other sort of emotion-based choice instead of identify and you'll see the same

489
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,260
problems pop up.

490
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,100
Like consider desiring instead.

491
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,900
Are you tall if you desire to be tall?

492
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,780
Obviously not.

493
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,020
Are you an athlete if you desire to be an athlete?

494
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,740
Though I will make note here that a lot of motivational inspirational perspectives put

495
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,060
forward the idea that you are the thing you desire.

496
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:19,980
Not because you actually are but because thinking you are is part of the mind state that helps

497
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,220
you accomplish the goal.

498
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,900
So you're not actually a professional basketball player.

499
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,540
But if you keep the identity of professional basketball player in your mind it may become

500
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,400
easier to do the day-to-day grind of actually becoming a professional basketball player.

501
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,900
Same with telling yourself I'm an artist to motivate yourself to create art.

502
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,980
The language of the fake it until you make it mentality directly mimics the I am what

503
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,100
I identify as attitude in the trans conversation.

504
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,180
But only to streamline the process of performing the real world behaviors that will actually

505
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,180
transform you into the thing that you're claiming to be.

506
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,820
Trans activists don't use the language in this way.

507
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,420
All that being said we're still talking about the progressives question of are all trans

508
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,740
women actually women?

509
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,380
And the self ID view fails that question spectacularly.

510
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,220
At first glance it seems to answer the question the way the progs want.

511
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,780
But as soon as you actually engage your brain and think about it even a little bit the logic

512
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,980
completely falls apart.

513
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,300
Some people will feel the need to hand wave all these objections away saying it doesn't

514
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,060
matter if the logic doesn't work trans women are women and whoever identifies as a woman

515
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,060
is one.

516
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,060
But that's just special pleading.

517
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:21,780
What they're really saying is I'm a-okay with this one specific domain being a place where

518
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,980
none of the rules of logic or language or meaning actually apply as long as it gets

519
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,960
me my desired political outcome.

520
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,820
Which is an attitude that is frankly directly in opposition to the pursuit of knowledge.

521
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:36,100
So finally here we are at the end of the progressive analysis on this question with

522
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,220
no answers that will ever actually satisfy the progressive.

523
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:43,800
In the taxonomic view no trans women are women because they will never produce large gametes.

524
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,940
In the social role view some trans women are women and some aren't while some men are also

525
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,940
women.

526
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,460
In the abolitionist view no trans women are women because women as a category and trans

527
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,120
women as a category don't exist.

528
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,560
In the prescriptive view the statement is trans women should be women but there's no

529
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,960
claim of whether or not trans women are women.

530
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,540
And in the self id view the term woman ends up being an empty word with no meaning making

531
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,800
everything and everyone simultaneously women and not women including a bunch of people

532
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,100
that the progs want explicitly not to be women like cis men.

533
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,160
Each of the five lenses fail to fulfill the progressives agenda when it comes to the question

534
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,080
of are all trans women actually women.

535
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,660
So what do we do now?

536
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,200
Personally I don't care I'm not a progressive.

537
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,120
I'm not chained to this requirement that all trans women be women.

538
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,660
I'm perfectly happy to gatekeep some people who claim to be trans women out of the label

539
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,800
of woman and that attitude frees us to consider two more possible positions.

540
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,240
The first one is that simply trans women aren't women at all.

541
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,660
When I talk to trans women who aren't ideologically captured by the left they generally say they're

542
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,960
okay with not being women they just don't want to be treated as men.

543
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,640
They know that they don't fulfill the taxonomy view of what a woman is but they also don't

544
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,780
fulfill the social role view of what a man is and in terms of that taxonomy view they're

545
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,700
often neuter producing no gametes depending on if they've had certain types of surgery

546
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,460
or how long they've been on hormones.

547
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:03,800
For them if trans woman is just its own separate thing distinct from both men and women they're

548
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,840
fine with that and I can see the logic here.

549
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,520
For example trans women have medical needs that are different from both men and women.

550
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,960
The attitude of I don't care what you view me as if trans women aren't women but just

551
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,280
its own thing fine just leave me alone so I can have my private life.

552
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,520
That's a pretty common view among trans women who aren't activists and to me that seems

553
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,960
perfectly reasonable.

554
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Ten years ago the left had a winning argument a knockout punch on this topic and it's this

555
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,400
women are adult human females but to be kind and decent we should respect people's identities

556
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,880
in a polite society.

557
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,820
However there are some areas of life where biological sex should win out like for example

558
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,820
in women's sports.

559
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,580
There you go conversation over we respect the biological reality that underpins human

560
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,400
sexual taxonomy while understanding that in a liberal society there should be reasonable

561
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:50,060
accommodations made for the outliers also while not allowing the outliers to rule over

562
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,980
all of society from the margins.

563
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,020
This is a conception of trans acceptance that doesn't demand other people think that all

564
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,300
trans women are women and there's no difference between them or any other brain dead nonsense

565
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,300
like that.

566
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,340
You don't genuinely need to believe that a trans woman is a woman deep in your heart

567
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,320
of hearts in order for trans women to still have a place at the table.

568
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,240
You simply need to not be an asshole.

569
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,820
This was the winning leftist position 10 years ago and the left abandoned it in order to

570
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:19,180
directly defy reality and logic with the insistence that everyone else must be true believers.

571
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,700
For them it's not enough that you're polite.

572
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,280
You must view reality the exact way they do through their exact lens with their exact

573
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,360
logic even if it breaks or else you're a transphobe utter nonsense.

574
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,980
The second new position is that trans women are women but that most of the people we see

575
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,600
right now claiming to be trans aren't actually trans and in order to explain that I'm going

576
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,720
to need to explain the concept of gender dysphoria.

577
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,540
Actually we're like half an hour into the video and I can't believe I haven't covered

578
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,540
this yet.

579
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:49,340
Gender dysphoria is what we call the distress experienced by a person due to the mismatch

580
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,780
between their gender and their biological sex.

581
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,580
In this conversation biological sex is the physical reality of your body, the primary

582
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:00,400
and secondary sexual characteristics while gender is the internal feeling and experience

583
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,480
of that biology.

584
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,620
If you're a cis man in terms of your body you've got a functioning dick.

585
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,380
In terms of your brain you're expecting a dick to be there and to be able to do dick

586
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,500
things with it.

587
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,340
Those two things line up and you're good to go.

588
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,500
From what we understand so far in a person with gender dysphoria their brain is expecting

589
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,280
a different body to what they're hooked up to.

590
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,580
The common analogy used is like a computer with the wrong drivers installed.

591
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,660
We don't know why people experience dysphoria but there's some evidence for a lot of very

592
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,760
different causes.

593
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,080
It might be an effect of puberty which passes when puberty is complete.

594
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,700
It might be a side effect of depression or abuse.

595
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,500
It might be the result of hormonal changes within the mother that the fetus is exposed

596
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,500
to.

597
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,900
It might be a genetic abnormality.

598
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,680
It might be all of these things we just don't know enough yet.

599
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,200
And before leftoids start coping, yes this is clearly a mental illness, if you're one

600
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,820
of those idiots who says it's not then you have no place in this conversation.

601
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,820
If dysphoria isn't a mental illness that causes distress, why do people transition

602
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,980
to treat it then, you fucking mongoloid?

603
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,860
Here's the thing though, back when we discussed that social role lens, I mentioned the femme

604
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,860
boys.

605
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,080
Gay men who look, speak, and act feminine.

606
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,980
Who adopt a feminine gender role in their relationships and sometimes in society.

607
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,980
But they're not trans.

608
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,460
They don't view themselves as women, they're still men.

609
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,460
They're just feminine men.

610
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,580
They don't fit into this view of gender dysphoria.

611
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:15,940
And that's probably why so many trans activists out there end up being toxic as fuck egg hatchers

612
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,460
trying to push feminine men into being trans.

613
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,780
Because femme boys are a giant red flag that our current understanding of gender dysphoria

614
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,340
doesn't quite make sense.

615
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,080
This is just my personal theory, I only have my intuition to go on here.

616
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,700
But I've spoken to a bunch of trans women at this point, and I've asked them all.

617
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:36,340
If they could wake up tomorrow as cis women with a real vagina and uterus and ovaries,

618
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,900
and an annoying monthly cycle, and the chromosomes and all the rest of it, they would.

619
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,440
To me that sounds like what they're experiencing isn't gender dysphoria, it's better described

620
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,440
as sex dysphoria.

621
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,200
It's not that trans women want to be women, that's only a part of it.

622
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,120
They want to be female from birth.

623
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,440
They literally want to be adult human females.

624
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,520
They can't be, obviously, but transitioning and becoming more female-like is how they

625
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,200
alleviate the stress of not being female.

626
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,180
The social role stuff, the passing, the behavior, that's all part of it.

627
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,000
And they take what they can get, but the thing they really want, the thing that is forever

628
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,760
out of reach, is the biology.

629
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,940
This is why the social role view is part of it, but it's not enough.

630
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,000
What does it mean to feel being female?

631
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,680
Is it liking to cook, or liking the color pink, or being attracted to masculine men?

632
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,360
A lot of women are like that, but a lot of gay men are like that too.

633
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,860
There's still that biological component in feeling a deep mismatch between your mind

634
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,860
and your body.

635
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:27,000
I know it's not exactly the female brain in a male body analogy.

636
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,720
We've got some evidence through brain scans that trans women's brains straddle the space

637
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,000
between cis men and cis women, and the whole topic is way more complicated.

638
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,120
But that view works for this conversation.

639
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,860
Additionally, the taxonomy view isn't enough either.

640
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,740
Let's say that you're somebody who is a strict believer in the woman is an adult

641
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,900
human female thing.

642
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,420
Okay, when you see a person who looks like a woman at the grocery store, what exactly

643
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,640
are you going to do before you decide to call them sir or ma'am?

644
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,060
Are you going to test her gametes where you treat her like a woman?

645
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,020
Most of us don't get to verify that sort of thing in a public setting, unless you're

646
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,020
pretty creepy.

647
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:00,500
Even for people who claim to follow a strictly biological lens in this conversation, in casual

648
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,740
situations, they will still put on the social role lens, just because it's quicker and

649
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,740
easier.

650
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,140
It's also just so funny to listen to Ben Shapiro on Joe Rogan intuitively call Blair

651
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:13,220
White she, and then immediately forcing himself to say he in order to try and maintain his

652
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,340
political position.

653
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:19,040
In normal day to day living, most people forget about biology and default to some version

654
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,760
of the social role view in casual circumstances.

655
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,420
If they look like a woman, then they are one, and if they don't, they don't.

656
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,220
You see a lady in a dress with long hair, looks pretty feminine, you're not going

657
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,260
to ask a question about biology, you're going to assume, oh, that's a woman.

658
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:34,440
This might suck for people who can't pass, but it is how the majority of people function.

659
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,000
If dysphoria is the issue, and it's not just going away with time or alleviation of

660
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,840
other problems, then we have two choices, make the brain more masculine, or make the

661
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,560
body more feminine, to bring the two in line.

662
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,880
And so far, it seems like making the brain more masculine is way, way tougher than making

663
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,140
the body more feminine.

664
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:57,080
A lot of people on the right say these people need help, not transitioning, failing to realize

665
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,120
that transitioning is the help.

666
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,160
Success rates for various forms of therapy to masculinize the brain are abysmal.

667
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,760
Way worse than the success rates to feminize the body, which frankly already aren't great.

668
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,680
But all of this is only legitimate if the dysphoria is both present and unchanging.

669
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,280
There's a new wave of trans activism which declares, as a natural end result of that

670
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,560
self-ID view, that you don't even need dysphoria to be trans, you just need to identify as

671
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
being trans.

672
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,240
Nowadays, if you believe that dysphoria is required, then you're a transmedicalist,

673
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,440
which is a negative word used to describe people who think that being trans is fundamentally

674
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,440
a medical phenomenon.

675
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,260
But the people who believe that you don't need dysphoria to be trans are probably the

676
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,220
single dumbest group I've spoken about in this video more than any other.

677
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,960
If you can simply identify as another gender, then why transition at all?

678
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,180
Just identify as the gender associated with your birth sex and dysphoria goes away lol,

679
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,780
obviously that's not how it works.

680
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:49,260
The issue ultimately is, if we take the entire class of people that the progs would call

681
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,860
trans women, we see within it, broadly, two categories.

682
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,300
In the first category we see people who, even though they're biologically male, they have

683
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,420
an affinity for femininity that goes beyond free will.

684
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:04,260
They've been like this their whole lives, and they can't choose not to be.

685
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:09,100
For them, nothing works, nothing alleviates their pain, with the exception of transitioning.

686
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,060
They have something more, something deeper than just identification.

687
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:16,560
They have a female essence in their body language, in their behavior, in the way that they speak,

688
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,320
that is, unfortunately, at war with their own male biology.

689
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,660
In the second category, we see people who have chosen to identify as women, and if you

690
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,360
don't accept their self-ID, you're a bigot.

691
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,920
There's no feminine essence to appeal to here, there's no sense that they can't help but

692
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,740
be in this unfortunate situation, there's only narcissism.

693
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:36,440
If there is truly a place for trans women to actually be women, it's going to be along

694
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,440
these lines.

695
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,120
The feminine essence that they can't help but embody, that shows itself not as a self-ID,

696
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,920
but as an uncontrollable affinity.

697
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,760
The issue is, ultimately, that the self-ID view of this topic is just the gender abolitionist

698
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,440
view in disguise.

699
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,760
Self-ID advocates know that their politics, if ever widely adopted, destroys gender as

700
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
a concept.

701
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,360
Either way, the TERFs are correct when they say that trans activists want to destroy the

702
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,520
concept of women.

703
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,880
The two positions outside of the progressive framework are, ironically enough, the two

704
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,520
most pro-trans coherent positions.

705
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,920
The first, where trans women aren't women, and that's fine because they're also not men.

706
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,720
The second, where people who have an innate and uncontrollable affinity towards female

707
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,080
biology are women.

708
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,080
The second one includes all cis women and all trans women who have gender dysphoria,

709
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,480
but it excludes all of the trans trenders, all the people who say you don't need dysphoria

710
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,300
to be trans, all the people who do it because it's a trendy aesthetic.

711
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,200
All of those people aren't women.

712
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,100
This is the only logically coherent framework by which at least some trans women are women

713
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,740
that also excludes men.

714
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:39,020
This is the most pro-trans position possible that actually makes sense, and the progs reject

715
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,020
it.

716
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,180
They would rather wreck the concept of woman entirely than compromise and get at least

717
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:47,500
some of their stated goals, because their actual goal is to wreck the concept of woman.

718
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:52,540
But to somebody who isn't ideologically captured by leftism, both of these positions are reasonable

719
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,540
compromises.

720
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:57,900
I find that off Twitter, off campus, and off the left, most trans people just want to chill

721
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,900
and be left alone.

722
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,500
They're not going to demand that you religiously believe that they're women.

723
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,460
They're just going to want you to be polite to them if you have to interact, and not shout

724
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,080
at them in the middle of the store because they can't pass or you clock them or something.

725
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,080
And you know what?

726
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,980
That's a perfectly reasonable thing to want.

727
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,340
So to answer the question once and for all, are trans women actually women?

728
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:18,100
In almost all views, the answer is necessarily no.

729
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,880
There is a view that allows some people who claim to be trans women to be women, but there

730
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,720
is no view that allows all trans women to be women.

731
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,160
And progressives reject the most coherent trans-positive position, not because they

732
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,520
want to include more trans people in the acceptance, but because trans people are simply their

733
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:37,040
political pawns, and they are happy to use, abuse, and discard them as such.
