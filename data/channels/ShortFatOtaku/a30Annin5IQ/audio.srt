00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
I figured I'd rattle this video off real quick before putting out the next one.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,080
There was enough comments worthy of serious reply on the capitalism vs socialism video

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,360
that it's worth it to bring them up in a video of their own.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,360
So let's go.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,720
David Razzie writes,

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,480
I loved Wigan Pier.

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,480
Sad and informative.

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,960
Loved the part where he says that if socialists had to spend one week with the working class,

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,600
they know what's best for, they wouldn't be able to stand rubbing elbows with them.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,320
Wigan Pier, by the way, was the George Orwell book where Orwell describes his travels through

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,920
the poor communities of the UK and how those experiences brought him into believing socialism

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,920
was the way forward.

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,260
But as the book goes on, he begins to critique that idea.

14
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,280
The part of Wigan Pier I included in the video was the critique of basically the bourgeois

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,280
socialist.

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,720
The person whose desire to redistribute wealth to the poor is not out of a love of the poor

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,400
but out of a hatred of their own class.

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,920
I brought this up because it really reminds me of a lot of verified Twitter journos.

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,000
Rich kids who have no problem living off dad's money but use socialism as an excuse to hate

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
their dad.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Because they have daddy issues.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,880
That's really all Twitter socialism is.

23
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,520
I mean, people like Jonathan McIntosh and Alex Lifshitz both fit this perfectly.

24
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,480
It also refers to that type of middle class socialism where people are born into the middle

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,640
class and have just enough of a chip on their shoulder to think they deserve to be in the

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,580
upper class but not enough work ethic to actually get there.

27
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,720
So they just want to destroy the upper class out of pettiness.

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,280
These are what we call cunts.

29
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,420
In my opinion, Orwell's analysis is correct.

30
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,340
It's easy to see why socialism appeals to so many people when you witness such terrible

31
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,340
suffering.

32
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,680
But it's ultimately not the way forward.

33
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,840
Torfi Borgramson, or whatever, writes,

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,200
I like to steer the conversation to something tangentially related to this, since we can

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,760
basically agree that capitalism is good along with a few regulations to keep its slightly

36
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,460
more egregious faults at bay.

37
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,760
What happens when all low-level jobs are eliminated by automation?

38
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,600
And then he goes on to offer an explanation of workers being able to compete with automation.

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,640
I have been banging my head against this problem for a while and I have only two solutions.

40
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,560
Only one of which being morally viable.

41
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,380
One, compensate all citizens that cannot work with the funds they need.

42
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,520
Or two, eliminate automation.

43
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,640
Is there something I'm overlooking?

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,920
If not, we have a bleak future ahead of us.

45
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,240
Automotion is probably the biggest wrench in the works when it comes to conventional

46
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,580
capitalism.

47
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,440
Conventional logic about advancing technologies always assumed that new industries to support

48
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,320
new technologies would provide just as many jobs as the old industries did, so that even

49
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,880
though there would be a rough transition period, society would ultimately benefit from the

50
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
new technology.

51
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,680
A great example of this is the swap from horses to automobiles.

52
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,480
When it became clear that automobiles were the way forward for transportation, the industries

53
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,840
surrounding horses basically collapsed.

54
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,040
People working in horse breeding, feeding, shoeing, stabling and so on, pretty rapidly

55
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,540
found themselves out of jobs.

56
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,120
But the new job network that was created to support the automobile created just as many

57
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,400
if not more jobs.

58
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,280
The assembly line, the mechanics, the transportation and distribution of fuel, plus all the industries

59
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,700
that sprung up from faster travel, trucking, shipping, delivery, tourism, modernization

60
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,920
of roads and so on.

61
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,700
The destruction of the industries that relied on horses was ultimately a net good.

62
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,800
And in fact, governments that used protectionist measures to prop up horse-related industries

63
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,080
and ban widespread use of autos, like the UK for a short period of time, found themselves

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,520
significantly further behind in regards to transportation as a result.

65
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,880
What generalized lesson we can take from this is that even though it may be rough on some

66
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,460
people, maybe even a lot of people, stifling technological advancement to protect industries

67
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,040
is a massive setback for society long term.

68
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,120
But also that the jobs created by advancement generally replace over time the jobs lost.

69
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,960
Regarding automation, we can agree that the first part of that rule still applies.

70
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,840
Staling technological advancement to protect industry would be a massive setback for our

71
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
society.

72
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,320
Especially when other nations who have no qualms about impoverishing their populations

73
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,320
with massive unregulated automation finally develop the means to do so.

74
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,640
These nations will completely crush western liberal democracies with their productive

75
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,320
output, as well as crush their own populations, if western liberal democracy does not solve

76
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,600
the automation problem.

77
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,060
But the second part of the rule may not apply.

78
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,140
It's not guaranteed the new generation of industry generated by widespread automation

79
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,460
will create at least an equal number of jobs to the amount lost to automation.

80
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,240
So we're stuck in a bind.

81
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,600
We need automation, but adopting it will destroy our workforce.

82
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,940
I'm not sure if a universal basic income is the right solution, but at the very least it

83
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,940
addresses the right problem, unlike the terrible solution of banning automation entirely.

84
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,220
But I think humanity has confronted something like this before during the massive transition

85
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,920
between hunter-gatherer societies and agricultural societies.

86
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,760
We can describe production as a ratio of time spent with goals achieved.

87
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,840
In the distant past, hunter-gatherer societies basically survived day to day.

88
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,860
They would spend large portions of their day hunting animals or collecting vegetables,

89
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,900
and generally the day afforded them just enough time to collect everything they needed to

90
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,320
survive for that day, or maybe a few days into the future, but nothing beyond that.

91
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,660
When civilizations stopped being nomadic and started building simple villages, the ability

92
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,900
to farm crops and livestock created more food than before.

93
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,420
The same amount of time is spent by both the farmer and the nomad, but the farmer has more

94
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,800
food for his effort.

95
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,000
This excess food is basically what allowed modern civilization to begin, because it allowed

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,680
for two types of people who do not contribute directly to either food production or defense

97
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,900
to serve society and not starve.

98
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,160
People who run simple governments, generally a noble class, and people who study the world,

99
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,640
generally a priestly class.

100
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,440
These people do not generate food with their work, they only consume it, but they do enrich

101
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,800
society in other ways, and the society is better off for it.

102
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,440
Even in modern times, there are so many jobs out there that have nothing to do with the

103
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,600
basic upkeep of society, but if we didn't have those jobs, our lives would be significantly

104
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
lower in quality.

105
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,440
I'm talking musicians, authors, programmers, lawyers, actors, artists, YouTubers.

106
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,920
This is the classic arts versus STEM argument.

107
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,160
STEM runs the world, but arts makes it worth running at all.

108
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,040
Over long periods of time, the percentage of people dedicated to society's basic upkeep

109
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,560
dwindled, and each time this happened quickly, society underwent a shock.

110
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,920
The economy was up-heaved as a new standard settled into place.

111
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,000
People suffered, but not in the long term.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,540
I think this is what will happen regarding automation.

113
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,760
People who own the automated factories cannot simply hoard all money in perpetuity because

114
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,560
then nobody would be able to buy their goods.

115
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,200
At the same time, the government cannot simply just take all the money from the factory owners

116
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,760
and give it to the jobless either, not without using force on them and turning into a totalitarian

117
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,760
state.

118
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,840
I think in the long term, meaning not in our lifetime unfortunately, society will again

119
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,020
readjust to a new economic standard.

120
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,260
There won't be an entire species of poor people for the next few million years due

121
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,260
to automation.

122
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,500
I think that the people who would have worked in manufacturing, who no longer can due to

123
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,380
automation, and yet who still don't join the workforce in the new jobs created by automation,

124
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,700
will still have roles to play in the new economy.

125
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,860
But those roles will involve developing new areas of human interest, and trading that

126
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,620
value with the people who still work in practical jobs.

127
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,280
Just like the priests and the nobles ate the farmer's food, but still contributed to

128
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,500
society in other ways that were far more beneficial than food production.

129
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,940
I'm not saying this process will be easy, I'm not even saying that everybody will

130
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,940
survive it.

131
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,340
I'm saying that it's probably the only way forward if you want western liberal democracy

132
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,340
to remain intact.

133
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,260
Frankly, it's the least amount of long-term suffering available to us, but our generation

134
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,460
is going to have to bear the largest cost.

135

140
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,960
There has never been a capitalist society.

141
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,260
If you consider our modern civilization to be capitalist, you're wrong.

142
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,800
We live in a social democracy, which is a mixture of both capitalism and socialism.

143
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,320
So if you say that capitalism is the most successful structure, you must also agree

144
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,560
that socialism, which is integrated with this capitalism, is also just as successful.

145
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,680
Your definition of socialism is asinine.

146
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,040
There are many different forms of socialism aside from Marxism which don't involve seizing

147
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,720
the means of production and distribution.

148
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,000
Take the government and the entire public sector, for example.

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,160
The police, the army, these are all socialist.

150
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,040
Again, we live in a social democracy, which makes use of both socialism and capitalism.

151
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,400
A capitalist society would be immediately flawed because it would remove morality from

152
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
the government.

153
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,000
It would create a structure divided by money, equivalent to power.

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,240
Those with more money have power over those below them.

155
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,600
They would remove the concept of equal opportunity, they would remove the safety net that provides

156
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,000
a certain quality of life to all of a country's population.

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,880
Soon enough, we would fall into a dystopian oligarch with horrible living and working

158
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,600
conditions for the lower class.

159
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,440
You right-wingers make the claim that the free market results in self-regulation of

160
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,080
morality as well as economy.

161
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,400
This is a completely false claim that no credible economist has ever made.

162
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,160
During the industrial revolution, businesses had no qualms about using child labour.

163
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,960
They still have no issues polluting the environment, the air you breathe and the water you drink.

164
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,240
Without regulation, it would be the businesses that hold power and dictate morality rather

165
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
than the people.

166
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,040
And you would be stupid to rely on businesses in this way, especially considering the rise

167
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,640
of automation, which will continue to rapidly reduce employment.

168
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,960
The fact is that a country has to be regulated by a government, which means social integration.

169
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,160
Our idealism about capitalism is just as flawed as the idealism about Marxism was before

170
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,960
the uprising of the communists.

171
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,360
Now a few other people have posted similar comments, so I'm going to try to address

172
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,680
them all here.

173
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,280
This idea that a capitalist economy with government regulation is the same as socialism, or is

174
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,060
a capitalism and socialism mix, is simply incorrect.

175
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,180
Socialism refers to the social ownership of the means of production.

176
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,600
That is the definition.

177
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,320
And let's be frank, that means government ownership of the means of production because

178
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,480
the government is the representative of the people and you can't have a mob of people

179
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,880
owning shit without appointing some type of leader.

180
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,360
So in practicality, socialism does refer to government ownership of the means of production,

181
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,360
not government regulation or even partial government participation in the economy.

182
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,760
These are different ideas than socialism.

183
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,480
Government regulation is when private business is legally mandated to maintain a minimum

184
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,200
standard for the public good.

185
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,960
So things like health regulation on food is not government ownership of the means of production.

186
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,040
It's government regulation of the privately owned means of production.

187
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,000
This is not socialism.

188
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,080
Government partial participation in the economy is when private businesses exist and remain

189
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,260
private, but the government decides to use its own resources to build its own competitor

190
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,460
in that market.

191
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:46,680
So things like a national post service is not government ownership of the means of production.

192
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,920
The government has built its own means of production to compete alongside the privately

193
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,040
owned means still within the marketplace, but it has not seized those privately owned

194
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,580
means for its own use.

195
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,320
This is still not socialism.

196
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,480
Well, what is socialism then?

197
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,880
When government seizes ownership of the means of production, that means that the government

198
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,500
decides it owns all private business.

199
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,360
It does not build its own alternative to private business.

200
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,520
It does not regulate private business.

201
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,080
It takes over private business, often unjustly and without compensation to the owners of

202
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,140
that business.

203
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,560
This is socialism.

204
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,700
So when people talk about places like Canada or Sweden or the UK being socialist democracies

205
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,580
or combinations of capitalism and socialism, my only reply to that is just no.

206
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,220
Having a healthcare service is not socialism.

207
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,620
Regulation is not socialism.

208
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,060
These things are still within the realm of capitalism.

209
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,420
A total lack of these things refers to laissez-faire capitalism where the government simply does

210
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,020
not give a shit about the economy, but regulated capitalism is still capitalism.

211
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,620
In fact, a serious danger of laissez-faire capitalism and why capitalism needs regulation

212
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,940
is the concept of the monopoly.

213
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,940
A monopoly in a market where one competitor owns the entire market, or alternatively a

214
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,380
small group of competitors decide to stop competing with each other and rig the market

215
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,980
in their collective favour, represents a situation where unregulated capitalism fails to act

216
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,940
in the interest of the public good.

217
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,900
Regulation in this instance is the opposite of socialism.

218
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,980
Rather than the government owning the means of production, the government is forcing the

219
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,260
market to allow competitors to compete in situations where one competitor owns the entire

220
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,200
means of production, and all new competitors to the market can no longer function based

221
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,540
on the validity of their product.

222
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,420
If a society were socialist, it would simply seize the monopoly for itself, but regulated

223
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,540
capitalism intervenes to allow the market to function like a market again.

224
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,980
I'll be talking more about monopolies and regulation in the interest of the public good

225
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,060
in my upcoming video on net neutrality.

226
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,340
Béjourjour1 writes, why is theocracy not included?

227
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,260
I am not surprised somebody named Béjour is asking about a theocracy.

228
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,900
Marcus Rezegh writes, just a thought, similar to how real socialism has not been tried yet,

229
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,320
it feels like many capitalists, who climax at the thought of laissez-faire, argue the

230
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,200
same line when confronted with past and current problems of capitalism.

231
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,080
As if removing all regulations will somehow make all problems go away.

232
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,240
In my opinion, anybody who says real anything has not been tried yet can be safely dismissed.

233
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,200
Can you imagine the reaction if I said, real nazism has never been tried, it's obviously

234
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,640
a good system, let's just try it.

235
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,440
It would be pure fucking insanity, dude.

236
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,240
I don't know why everybody's willing to give the socialist this free pass, I'm certainly

237
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,240
not.

238
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
They're fucking immoral.

239
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,400
Alpha Potent writes, you refuted the anarchists, but what about the anarcho-capitalist perspective?

240
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,760
I mean, if the society agrees enough to vote in an uncapped majority, 50% already agree

241
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,760
with the NAP, so any revolutions are improbable since it's unlikely that in this day and

242
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,080
age a modern country would let its majority be suppressed.

243
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,680
Dude, I don't want to sit in my house and claim it as my property 24-7.

244
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,240
And don't say some shit like private security companies will do it for you, because those

245
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,280
won't exist.

246
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,180
Those people will have their own houses to take care of, they won't want to be there

247
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,400
protecting yours.

248
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,040
Unless of course, you intend to start giving them room and board at your place in compensation

249
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,560
for them defending your land, and oops, it looks like we've got feudalism all over

250
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,560
again.

251
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,080
Brocialist Party of America writes, uh, a lot of stuff.

252
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,160
This guy is quite literally the angry middle-class socialist Orwell described.

253
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,640
He's good for a laugh, but there's honestly not much to reply to here, there's so much

254
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,640
delusion.

255
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,800
Socialism doesn't believe in great works, reality says otherwise, you dumb piece of

256
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
shit.

257
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,020
Remind me again who developed the first satellite, put the first humans and animals in space

258
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,080
and invented cell phones and laser eye surgery?

259
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,720
The Soviet Union.

260
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,600
Remind me who did literally everything else, and on top of that, took all of those socialist

261
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,320
achievements and radically improved upon them.

262
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,280
And on top of that, has still managed to survive and pull more people out of poverty world

263
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,280
wide?

264
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Yeah, that's capitalism.

265
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,960
I know that America, for example, is not happy about jobs going overseas.

266
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,440
But in the long term, for the bigger picture, it's actually a good thing that India and

267
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,520
China, two countries with some of the most grinding poverty on earth, also have some

268
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,800
of the fastest growing middle classes on earth.

269
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,920
It's not a bad thing that Chinese and Indian peasants are no longer starving and capitalism

270
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,920
did that.

271
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,800
The American class is awfully angry that it came off their backs and I don't blame them.

272
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,400
Their problems need solving as well.

273
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,240
But let's not pretend that world wide capitalism isn't helping people.

274
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,360
Well that's that, at least for now.

275
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,920
I'm going to be using some of the ideas and definitions from my capitalist video in the

276
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,020
upcoming net neutrality video, so if you haven't seen it yet you might want to go and brush

277
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,020
up on it.

278
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,840
I'll see you guys in a few days.
