00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
I figured I'd rattle this video off real quick before putting out the next one.

00:03.400 --> 00:07.080
There was enough comments worthy of serious reply on the capitalism vs socialism video

00:07.080 --> 00:09.360
that it's worth it to bring them up in a video of their own.

00:09.360 --> 00:10.360
So let's go.

00:10.360 --> 00:11.720
David Razzie writes,

00:11.720 --> 00:13.480
I loved Wigan Pier.

00:13.480 --> 00:14.480
Sad and informative.

00:14.480 --> 00:17.960
Loved the part where he says that if socialists had to spend one week with the working class,

00:17.960 --> 00:21.600
they know what's best for, they wouldn't be able to stand rubbing elbows with them.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.320
Wigan Pier, by the way, was the George Orwell book where Orwell describes his travels through

00:25.320 --> 00:28.920
the poor communities of the UK and how those experiences brought him into believing socialism

00:28.920 --> 00:29.920
was the way forward.

00:29.920 --> 00:32.260
But as the book goes on, he begins to critique that idea.

00:32.260 --> 00:36.280
The part of Wigan Pier I included in the video was the critique of basically the bourgeois

00:36.280 --> 00:37.280
socialist.

00:37.280 --> 00:40.720
The person whose desire to redistribute wealth to the poor is not out of a love of the poor

00:40.720 --> 00:42.400
but out of a hatred of their own class.

00:42.400 --> 00:45.920
I brought this up because it really reminds me of a lot of verified Twitter journos.

00:45.920 --> 00:50.000
Rich kids who have no problem living off dad's money but use socialism as an excuse to hate

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
their dad.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Because they have daddy issues.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.880
That's really all Twitter socialism is.

00:53.880 --> 00:58.520
I mean, people like Jonathan McIntosh and Alex Lifshitz both fit this perfectly.

00:58.520 --> 01:02.480
It also refers to that type of middle class socialism where people are born into the middle

01:02.480 --> 01:05.640
class and have just enough of a chip on their shoulder to think they deserve to be in the

01:05.640 --> 01:08.580
upper class but not enough work ethic to actually get there.

01:08.580 --> 01:10.720
So they just want to destroy the upper class out of pettiness.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.280
These are what we call cunts.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.420
In my opinion, Orwell's analysis is correct.

01:14.420 --> 01:18.340
It's easy to see why socialism appeals to so many people when you witness such terrible

01:18.340 --> 01:19.340
suffering.

01:19.340 --> 01:20.680
But it's ultimately not the way forward.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.840
Torfi Borgramson, or whatever, writes,

01:23.840 --> 01:27.200
I like to steer the conversation to something tangentially related to this, since we can

01:27.200 --> 01:30.760
basically agree that capitalism is good along with a few regulations to keep its slightly

01:30.760 --> 01:32.460
more egregious faults at bay.

01:32.460 --> 01:35.760
What happens when all low-level jobs are eliminated by automation?

01:35.760 --> 01:39.600
And then he goes on to offer an explanation of workers being able to compete with automation.

01:39.600 --> 01:43.640
I have been banging my head against this problem for a while and I have only two solutions.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.560
Only one of which being morally viable.

01:45.560 --> 01:49.380
One, compensate all citizens that cannot work with the funds they need.

01:49.380 --> 01:51.520
Or two, eliminate automation.

01:51.520 --> 01:52.640
Is there something I'm overlooking?

01:52.640 --> 01:54.920
If not, we have a bleak future ahead of us.

01:54.920 --> 01:58.240
Automotion is probably the biggest wrench in the works when it comes to conventional

01:58.240 --> 01:59.580
capitalism.

01:59.580 --> 02:03.440
Conventional logic about advancing technologies always assumed that new industries to support

02:03.440 --> 02:07.320
new technologies would provide just as many jobs as the old industries did, so that even

02:07.320 --> 02:10.880
though there would be a rough transition period, society would ultimately benefit from the

02:10.880 --> 02:11.880
new technology.

02:11.880 --> 02:14.680
A great example of this is the swap from horses to automobiles.

02:14.680 --> 02:18.480
When it became clear that automobiles were the way forward for transportation, the industries

02:18.480 --> 02:20.840
surrounding horses basically collapsed.

02:20.840 --> 02:25.040
People working in horse breeding, feeding, shoeing, stabling and so on, pretty rapidly

02:25.040 --> 02:26.540
found themselves out of jobs.

02:26.540 --> 02:30.120
But the new job network that was created to support the automobile created just as many

02:30.120 --> 02:31.400
if not more jobs.

02:31.400 --> 02:36.280
The assembly line, the mechanics, the transportation and distribution of fuel, plus all the industries

02:36.280 --> 02:40.700
that sprung up from faster travel, trucking, shipping, delivery, tourism, modernization

02:40.700 --> 02:41.920
of roads and so on.

02:41.920 --> 02:45.700
The destruction of the industries that relied on horses was ultimately a net good.

02:45.700 --> 02:49.800
And in fact, governments that used protectionist measures to prop up horse-related industries

02:49.800 --> 02:55.080
and ban widespread use of autos, like the UK for a short period of time, found themselves

02:55.080 --> 02:58.520
significantly further behind in regards to transportation as a result.

02:58.520 --> 03:02.880
What generalized lesson we can take from this is that even though it may be rough on some

03:02.880 --> 03:07.460
people, maybe even a lot of people, stifling technological advancement to protect industries

03:07.460 --> 03:10.040
is a massive setback for society long term.

03:10.040 --> 03:15.120
But also that the jobs created by advancement generally replace over time the jobs lost.

03:15.120 --> 03:18.960
Regarding automation, we can agree that the first part of that rule still applies.

03:18.960 --> 03:22.840
Staling technological advancement to protect industry would be a massive setback for our

03:22.840 --> 03:23.840
society.

03:23.840 --> 03:27.320
Especially when other nations who have no qualms about impoverishing their populations

03:27.320 --> 03:31.320
with massive unregulated automation finally develop the means to do so.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.640
These nations will completely crush western liberal democracies with their productive

03:34.640 --> 03:39.320
output, as well as crush their own populations, if western liberal democracy does not solve

03:39.320 --> 03:40.600
the automation problem.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.060
But the second part of the rule may not apply.

03:43.060 --> 03:47.140
It's not guaranteed the new generation of industry generated by widespread automation

03:47.140 --> 03:51.460
will create at least an equal number of jobs to the amount lost to automation.

03:51.460 --> 03:53.240
So we're stuck in a bind.

03:53.240 --> 03:56.600
We need automation, but adopting it will destroy our workforce.

03:56.600 --> 04:00.940
I'm not sure if a universal basic income is the right solution, but at the very least it

04:00.940 --> 04:04.940
addresses the right problem, unlike the terrible solution of banning automation entirely.

04:04.940 --> 04:09.220
But I think humanity has confronted something like this before during the massive transition

04:09.220 --> 04:12.920
between hunter-gatherer societies and agricultural societies.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.760
We can describe production as a ratio of time spent with goals achieved.

04:16.760 --> 04:20.840
In the distant past, hunter-gatherer societies basically survived day to day.

04:20.840 --> 04:24.860
They would spend large portions of their day hunting animals or collecting vegetables,

04:24.860 --> 04:27.900
and generally the day afforded them just enough time to collect everything they needed to

04:27.900 --> 04:32.320
survive for that day, or maybe a few days into the future, but nothing beyond that.

04:32.320 --> 04:36.660
When civilizations stopped being nomadic and started building simple villages, the ability

04:36.660 --> 04:39.900
to farm crops and livestock created more food than before.

04:39.900 --> 04:44.420
The same amount of time is spent by both the farmer and the nomad, but the farmer has more

04:44.420 --> 04:45.800
food for his effort.

04:45.840 --> 04:50.000
This excess food is basically what allowed modern civilization to begin, because it allowed

04:50.000 --> 04:53.680
for two types of people who do not contribute directly to either food production or defense

04:53.680 --> 04:55.900
to serve society and not starve.

04:55.900 --> 05:01.160
People who run simple governments, generally a noble class, and people who study the world,

05:01.160 --> 05:02.640
generally a priestly class.

05:02.640 --> 05:06.440
These people do not generate food with their work, they only consume it, but they do enrich

05:06.440 --> 05:09.800
society in other ways, and the society is better off for it.

05:09.800 --> 05:13.440
Even in modern times, there are so many jobs out there that have nothing to do with the

05:13.440 --> 05:17.600
basic upkeep of society, but if we didn't have those jobs, our lives would be significantly

05:17.600 --> 05:18.600
lower in quality.

05:18.600 --> 05:24.440
I'm talking musicians, authors, programmers, lawyers, actors, artists, YouTubers.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.920
This is the classic arts versus STEM argument.

05:26.920 --> 05:30.160
STEM runs the world, but arts makes it worth running at all.

05:30.160 --> 05:34.040
Over long periods of time, the percentage of people dedicated to society's basic upkeep

05:34.040 --> 05:38.560
dwindled, and each time this happened quickly, society underwent a shock.

05:38.560 --> 05:41.920
The economy was up-heaved as a new standard settled into place.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.000
People suffered, but not in the long term.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.540
I think this is what will happen regarding automation.

05:46.540 --> 05:50.760
People who own the automated factories cannot simply hoard all money in perpetuity because

05:50.760 --> 05:52.560
then nobody would be able to buy their goods.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.200
At the same time, the government cannot simply just take all the money from the factory owners

05:56.200 --> 06:00.760
and give it to the jobless either, not without using force on them and turning into a totalitarian

06:00.760 --> 06:01.760
state.

06:01.760 --> 06:06.840
I think in the long term, meaning not in our lifetime unfortunately, society will again

06:06.840 --> 06:09.020
readjust to a new economic standard.

06:09.020 --> 06:12.260
There won't be an entire species of poor people for the next few million years due

06:12.260 --> 06:13.260
to automation.

06:13.260 --> 06:17.500
I think that the people who would have worked in manufacturing, who no longer can due to

06:17.500 --> 06:22.380
automation, and yet who still don't join the workforce in the new jobs created by automation,

06:22.380 --> 06:24.700
will still have roles to play in the new economy.

06:24.700 --> 06:28.860
But those roles will involve developing new areas of human interest, and trading that

06:28.860 --> 06:31.620
value with the people who still work in practical jobs.

06:31.620 --> 06:35.280
Just like the priests and the nobles ate the farmer's food, but still contributed to

06:35.280 --> 06:38.500
society in other ways that were far more beneficial than food production.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.940
I'm not saying this process will be easy, I'm not even saying that everybody will

06:41.940 --> 06:42.940
survive it.

06:42.940 --> 06:46.340
I'm saying that it's probably the only way forward if you want western liberal democracy

06:46.340 --> 06:47.340
to remain intact.

06:47.340 --> 06:52.260
Frankly, it's the least amount of long-term suffering available to us, but our generation

06:52.260 --> 06:54.460
is going to have to bear the largest cost.

06:54.460 --> 06:56.500
Barrow 45 writes,

06:56.500 --> 06:59.960

iSmithy writes,

07:06.340 --> 07:07.960
There has never been a capitalist society.

07:07.960 --> 07:11.260
If you consider our modern civilization to be capitalist, you're wrong.

07:11.260 --> 07:15.800
We live in a social democracy, which is a mixture of both capitalism and socialism.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.320
So if you say that capitalism is the most successful structure, you must also agree

07:19.320 --> 07:23.560
that socialism, which is integrated with this capitalism, is also just as successful.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.680
Your definition of socialism is asinine.

07:25.680 --> 07:29.040
There are many different forms of socialism aside from Marxism which don't involve seizing

07:29.040 --> 07:30.720
the means of production and distribution.

07:30.720 --> 07:33.000
Take the government and the entire public sector, for example.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.160
The police, the army, these are all socialist.

07:35.160 --> 07:40.040
Again, we live in a social democracy, which makes use of both socialism and capitalism.

07:40.040 --> 07:43.400
A capitalist society would be immediately flawed because it would remove morality from

07:43.400 --> 07:44.400
the government.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.000
It would create a structure divided by money, equivalent to power.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.240
Those with more money have power over those below them.

07:49.240 --> 07:52.600
They would remove the concept of equal opportunity, they would remove the safety net that provides

07:52.600 --> 07:55.000
a certain quality of life to all of a country's population.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.880
Soon enough, we would fall into a dystopian oligarch with horrible living and working

07:58.880 --> 08:00.600
conditions for the lower class.

08:00.600 --> 08:04.440
You right-wingers make the claim that the free market results in self-regulation of

08:04.440 --> 08:06.080
morality as well as economy.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.400
This is a completely false claim that no credible economist has ever made.

08:09.400 --> 08:13.160
During the industrial revolution, businesses had no qualms about using child labour.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.960
They still have no issues polluting the environment, the air you breathe and the water you drink.

08:16.960 --> 08:20.240
Without regulation, it would be the businesses that hold power and dictate morality rather

08:20.240 --> 08:21.240
than the people.

08:21.240 --> 08:24.040
And you would be stupid to rely on businesses in this way, especially considering the rise

08:24.040 --> 08:26.640
of automation, which will continue to rapidly reduce employment.

08:26.640 --> 08:30.960
The fact is that a country has to be regulated by a government, which means social integration.

08:30.960 --> 08:35.160
Our idealism about capitalism is just as flawed as the idealism about Marxism was before

08:35.160 --> 08:36.960
the uprising of the communists.

08:36.960 --> 08:40.360
Now a few other people have posted similar comments, so I'm going to try to address

08:40.360 --> 08:41.680
them all here.

08:41.680 --> 08:47.280
This idea that a capitalist economy with government regulation is the same as socialism, or is

08:47.280 --> 08:51.060
a capitalism and socialism mix, is simply incorrect.

08:51.060 --> 08:54.180
Socialism refers to the social ownership of the means of production.

08:54.180 --> 08:55.600
That is the definition.

08:55.600 --> 08:59.320
And let's be frank, that means government ownership of the means of production because

08:59.320 --> 09:02.480
the government is the representative of the people and you can't have a mob of people

09:02.480 --> 09:04.880
owning shit without appointing some type of leader.

09:04.880 --> 09:09.360
So in practicality, socialism does refer to government ownership of the means of production,

09:09.360 --> 09:13.360
not government regulation or even partial government participation in the economy.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.760
These are different ideas than socialism.

09:15.760 --> 09:19.480
Government regulation is when private business is legally mandated to maintain a minimum

09:19.480 --> 09:21.200
standard for the public good.

09:21.200 --> 09:25.960
So things like health regulation on food is not government ownership of the means of production.

09:25.960 --> 09:29.040
It's government regulation of the privately owned means of production.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.000
This is not socialism.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.080
Government partial participation in the economy is when private businesses exist and remain

09:36.080 --> 09:40.260
private, but the government decides to use its own resources to build its own competitor

09:40.260 --> 09:41.460
in that market.

09:41.460 --> 09:46.680
So things like a national post service is not government ownership of the means of production.

09:46.680 --> 09:50.920
The government has built its own means of production to compete alongside the privately

09:50.920 --> 09:55.040
owned means still within the marketplace, but it has not seized those privately owned

09:55.040 --> 09:56.580
means for its own use.

09:56.580 --> 09:58.320
This is still not socialism.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.480
Well, what is socialism then?

10:00.480 --> 10:03.880
When government seizes ownership of the means of production, that means that the government

10:03.880 --> 10:06.500
decides it owns all private business.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.360
It does not build its own alternative to private business.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.520
It does not regulate private business.

10:11.520 --> 10:17.080
It takes over private business, often unjustly and without compensation to the owners of

10:17.080 --> 10:18.140
that business.

10:18.140 --> 10:19.560
This is socialism.

10:19.560 --> 10:24.700
So when people talk about places like Canada or Sweden or the UK being socialist democracies

10:24.700 --> 10:29.580
or combinations of capitalism and socialism, my only reply to that is just no.

10:29.580 --> 10:32.220
Having a healthcare service is not socialism.

10:32.220 --> 10:33.620
Regulation is not socialism.

10:33.620 --> 10:36.060
These things are still within the realm of capitalism.

10:36.060 --> 10:40.420
A total lack of these things refers to laissez-faire capitalism where the government simply does

10:40.420 --> 10:45.020
not give a shit about the economy, but regulated capitalism is still capitalism.

10:45.020 --> 10:49.620
In fact, a serious danger of laissez-faire capitalism and why capitalism needs regulation

10:49.620 --> 10:50.940
is the concept of the monopoly.

10:50.940 --> 10:54.940
A monopoly in a market where one competitor owns the entire market, or alternatively a

10:54.940 --> 10:58.380
small group of competitors decide to stop competing with each other and rig the market

10:58.380 --> 11:02.980
in their collective favour, represents a situation where unregulated capitalism fails to act

11:02.980 --> 11:04.940
in the interest of the public good.

11:04.940 --> 11:07.900
Regulation in this instance is the opposite of socialism.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.980
Rather than the government owning the means of production, the government is forcing the

11:10.980 --> 11:15.260
market to allow competitors to compete in situations where one competitor owns the entire

11:15.260 --> 11:19.200
means of production, and all new competitors to the market can no longer function based

11:19.200 --> 11:20.540
on the validity of their product.

11:20.540 --> 11:25.420
If a society were socialist, it would simply seize the monopoly for itself, but regulated

11:25.420 --> 11:28.540
capitalism intervenes to allow the market to function like a market again.

11:28.540 --> 11:31.980
I'll be talking more about monopolies and regulation in the interest of the public good

11:31.980 --> 11:34.060
in my upcoming video on net neutrality.

11:34.060 --> 11:37.340
Béjourjour1 writes, why is theocracy not included?

11:37.340 --> 11:41.260
I am not surprised somebody named Béjour is asking about a theocracy.

11:41.260 --> 11:45.900
Marcus Rezegh writes, just a thought, similar to how real socialism has not been tried yet,

11:45.900 --> 11:49.320
it feels like many capitalists, who climax at the thought of laissez-faire, argue the

11:49.320 --> 11:52.200
same line when confronted with past and current problems of capitalism.

11:52.200 --> 11:56.080
As if removing all regulations will somehow make all problems go away.

11:56.080 --> 12:01.240
In my opinion, anybody who says real anything has not been tried yet can be safely dismissed.

12:01.240 --> 12:05.200
Can you imagine the reaction if I said, real nazism has never been tried, it's obviously

12:05.200 --> 12:06.640
a good system, let's just try it.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.440
It would be pure fucking insanity, dude.

12:08.440 --> 12:12.240
I don't know why everybody's willing to give the socialist this free pass, I'm certainly

12:12.240 --> 12:13.240
not.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.240
They're fucking immoral.

12:14.240 --> 12:18.400
Alpha Potent writes, you refuted the anarchists, but what about the anarcho-capitalist perspective?

12:18.480 --> 12:22.760
I mean, if the society agrees enough to vote in an uncapped majority, 50% already agree

12:22.760 --> 12:26.760
with the NAP, so any revolutions are improbable since it's unlikely that in this day and

12:26.760 --> 12:29.080
age a modern country would let its majority be suppressed.

12:29.080 --> 12:32.680
Dude, I don't want to sit in my house and claim it as my property 24-7.

12:32.680 --> 12:36.240
And don't say some shit like private security companies will do it for you, because those

12:36.240 --> 12:37.280
won't exist.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.180
Those people will have their own houses to take care of, they won't want to be there

12:40.180 --> 12:41.400
protecting yours.

12:41.400 --> 12:46.040
Unless of course, you intend to start giving them room and board at your place in compensation

12:46.040 --> 12:49.560
for them defending your land, and oops, it looks like we've got feudalism all over

12:49.560 --> 12:50.560
again.

12:50.560 --> 12:54.080
Brocialist Party of America writes, uh, a lot of stuff.

12:54.080 --> 12:58.160
This guy is quite literally the angry middle-class socialist Orwell described.

12:58.160 --> 13:01.640
He's good for a laugh, but there's honestly not much to reply to here, there's so much

13:01.640 --> 13:02.640
delusion.

13:02.640 --> 13:05.800
Socialism doesn't believe in great works, reality says otherwise, you dumb piece of

13:05.800 --> 13:06.800
shit.

13:06.800 --> 13:10.020
Remind me again who developed the first satellite, put the first humans and animals in space

13:10.020 --> 13:12.080
and invented cell phones and laser eye surgery?

13:12.080 --> 13:13.720
The Soviet Union.

13:13.720 --> 13:18.600
Remind me who did literally everything else, and on top of that, took all of those socialist

13:18.600 --> 13:21.320
achievements and radically improved upon them.

13:21.320 --> 13:25.280
And on top of that, has still managed to survive and pull more people out of poverty world

13:25.280 --> 13:26.280
wide?

13:26.280 --> 13:27.280
Yeah, that's capitalism.

13:27.280 --> 13:30.960
I know that America, for example, is not happy about jobs going overseas.

13:30.960 --> 13:34.440
But in the long term, for the bigger picture, it's actually a good thing that India and

13:34.440 --> 13:38.520
China, two countries with some of the most grinding poverty on earth, also have some

13:38.520 --> 13:40.800
of the fastest growing middle classes on earth.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.920
It's not a bad thing that Chinese and Indian peasants are no longer starving and capitalism

13:44.920 --> 13:45.920
did that.

13:45.920 --> 13:49.800
The American class is awfully angry that it came off their backs and I don't blame them.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.400
Their problems need solving as well.

13:51.400 --> 13:54.240
But let's not pretend that world wide capitalism isn't helping people.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.360
Well that's that, at least for now.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.920
I'm going to be using some of the ideas and definitions from my capitalist video in the

13:58.920 --> 14:02.020
upcoming net neutrality video, so if you haven't seen it yet you might want to go and brush

14:02.020 --> 14:03.020
up on it.

14:03.020 --> 14:03.840
I'll see you guys in a few days.
