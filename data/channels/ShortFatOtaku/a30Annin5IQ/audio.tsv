0	3400	I figured I'd rattle this video off real quick before putting out the next one.
3400	7080	There was enough comments worthy of serious reply on the capitalism vs socialism video
7080	9360	that it's worth it to bring them up in a video of their own.
9360	10360	So let's go.
10360	11720	David Razzie writes,
11720	13480	I loved Wigan Pier.
13480	14480	Sad and informative.
14480	17960	Loved the part where he says that if socialists had to spend one week with the working class,
17960	21600	they know what's best for, they wouldn't be able to stand rubbing elbows with them.
21600	25320	Wigan Pier, by the way, was the George Orwell book where Orwell describes his travels through
25320	28920	the poor communities of the UK and how those experiences brought him into believing socialism
28920	29920	was the way forward.
29920	32260	But as the book goes on, he begins to critique that idea.
32260	36280	The part of Wigan Pier I included in the video was the critique of basically the bourgeois
36280	37280	socialist.
37280	40720	The person whose desire to redistribute wealth to the poor is not out of a love of the poor
40720	42400	but out of a hatred of their own class.
42400	45920	I brought this up because it really reminds me of a lot of verified Twitter journos.
45920	50000	Rich kids who have no problem living off dad's money but use socialism as an excuse to hate
50000	51000	their dad.
51000	52000	Because they have daddy issues.
52000	53880	That's really all Twitter socialism is.
53880	58520	I mean, people like Jonathan McIntosh and Alex Lifshitz both fit this perfectly.
58520	62480	It also refers to that type of middle class socialism where people are born into the middle
62480	65640	class and have just enough of a chip on their shoulder to think they deserve to be in the
65640	68580	upper class but not enough work ethic to actually get there.
68580	70720	So they just want to destroy the upper class out of pettiness.
70720	72280	These are what we call cunts.
72280	74420	In my opinion, Orwell's analysis is correct.
74420	78340	It's easy to see why socialism appeals to so many people when you witness such terrible
78340	79340	suffering.
79340	80680	But it's ultimately not the way forward.
80680	83840	Torfi Borgramson, or whatever, writes,
83840	87200	I like to steer the conversation to something tangentially related to this, since we can
87200	90760	basically agree that capitalism is good along with a few regulations to keep its slightly
90760	92460	more egregious faults at bay.
92460	95760	What happens when all low-level jobs are eliminated by automation?
95760	99600	And then he goes on to offer an explanation of workers being able to compete with automation.
99600	103640	I have been banging my head against this problem for a while and I have only two solutions.
103640	105560	Only one of which being morally viable.
105560	109380	One, compensate all citizens that cannot work with the funds they need.
109380	111520	Or two, eliminate automation.
111520	112640	Is there something I'm overlooking?
112640	114920	If not, we have a bleak future ahead of us.
114920	118240	Automotion is probably the biggest wrench in the works when it comes to conventional
118240	119580	capitalism.
119580	123440	Conventional logic about advancing technologies always assumed that new industries to support
123440	127320	new technologies would provide just as many jobs as the old industries did, so that even
127320	130880	though there would be a rough transition period, society would ultimately benefit from the
130880	131880	new technology.
131880	134680	A great example of this is the swap from horses to automobiles.
134680	138480	When it became clear that automobiles were the way forward for transportation, the industries
138480	140840	surrounding horses basically collapsed.
140840	145040	People working in horse breeding, feeding, shoeing, stabling and so on, pretty rapidly
145040	146540	found themselves out of jobs.
146540	150120	But the new job network that was created to support the automobile created just as many
150120	151400	if not more jobs.
151400	156280	The assembly line, the mechanics, the transportation and distribution of fuel, plus all the industries
156280	160700	that sprung up from faster travel, trucking, shipping, delivery, tourism, modernization
160700	161920	of roads and so on.
161920	165700	The destruction of the industries that relied on horses was ultimately a net good.
165700	169800	And in fact, governments that used protectionist measures to prop up horse-related industries
169800	175080	and ban widespread use of autos, like the UK for a short period of time, found themselves
175080	178520	significantly further behind in regards to transportation as a result.
178520	182880	What generalized lesson we can take from this is that even though it may be rough on some
182880	187460	people, maybe even a lot of people, stifling technological advancement to protect industries
187460	190040	is a massive setback for society long term.
190040	195120	But also that the jobs created by advancement generally replace over time the jobs lost.
195120	198960	Regarding automation, we can agree that the first part of that rule still applies.
198960	202840	Staling technological advancement to protect industry would be a massive setback for our
202840	203840	society.
203840	207320	Especially when other nations who have no qualms about impoverishing their populations
207320	211320	with massive unregulated automation finally develop the means to do so.
211320	214640	These nations will completely crush western liberal democracies with their productive
214640	219320	output, as well as crush their own populations, if western liberal democracy does not solve
219320	220600	the automation problem.
220600	223060	But the second part of the rule may not apply.
223060	227140	It's not guaranteed the new generation of industry generated by widespread automation
227140	231460	will create at least an equal number of jobs to the amount lost to automation.
231460	233240	So we're stuck in a bind.
233240	236600	We need automation, but adopting it will destroy our workforce.
236600	240940	I'm not sure if a universal basic income is the right solution, but at the very least it
240940	244940	addresses the right problem, unlike the terrible solution of banning automation entirely.
244940	249220	But I think humanity has confronted something like this before during the massive transition
249220	252920	between hunter-gatherer societies and agricultural societies.
252920	256760	We can describe production as a ratio of time spent with goals achieved.
256760	260840	In the distant past, hunter-gatherer societies basically survived day to day.
260840	264860	They would spend large portions of their day hunting animals or collecting vegetables,
264860	267900	and generally the day afforded them just enough time to collect everything they needed to
267900	272320	survive for that day, or maybe a few days into the future, but nothing beyond that.
272320	276660	When civilizations stopped being nomadic and started building simple villages, the ability
276660	279900	to farm crops and livestock created more food than before.
279900	284420	The same amount of time is spent by both the farmer and the nomad, but the farmer has more
284420	285800	food for his effort.
285840	290000	This excess food is basically what allowed modern civilization to begin, because it allowed
290000	293680	for two types of people who do not contribute directly to either food production or defense
293680	295900	to serve society and not starve.
295900	301160	People who run simple governments, generally a noble class, and people who study the world,
301160	302640	generally a priestly class.
302640	306440	These people do not generate food with their work, they only consume it, but they do enrich
306440	309800	society in other ways, and the society is better off for it.
309800	313440	Even in modern times, there are so many jobs out there that have nothing to do with the
313440	317600	basic upkeep of society, but if we didn't have those jobs, our lives would be significantly
317600	318600	lower in quality.
318600	324440	I'm talking musicians, authors, programmers, lawyers, actors, artists, YouTubers.
324440	326920	This is the classic arts versus STEM argument.
326920	330160	STEM runs the world, but arts makes it worth running at all.
330160	334040	Over long periods of time, the percentage of people dedicated to society's basic upkeep
334040	338560	dwindled, and each time this happened quickly, society underwent a shock.
338560	341920	The economy was up-heaved as a new standard settled into place.
341920	344000	People suffered, but not in the long term.
344000	346540	I think this is what will happen regarding automation.
346540	350760	People who own the automated factories cannot simply hoard all money in perpetuity because
350760	352560	then nobody would be able to buy their goods.
352560	356200	At the same time, the government cannot simply just take all the money from the factory owners
356200	360760	and give it to the jobless either, not without using force on them and turning into a totalitarian
360760	361760	state.
361760	366840	I think in the long term, meaning not in our lifetime unfortunately, society will again
366840	369020	readjust to a new economic standard.
369020	372260	There won't be an entire species of poor people for the next few million years due
372260	373260	to automation.
373260	377500	I think that the people who would have worked in manufacturing, who no longer can due to
377500	382380	automation, and yet who still don't join the workforce in the new jobs created by automation,
382380	384700	will still have roles to play in the new economy.
384700	388860	But those roles will involve developing new areas of human interest, and trading that
388860	391620	value with the people who still work in practical jobs.
391620	395280	Just like the priests and the nobles ate the farmer's food, but still contributed to
395280	398500	society in other ways that were far more beneficial than food production.
398500	401940	I'm not saying this process will be easy, I'm not even saying that everybody will
401940	402940	survive it.
402940	406340	I'm saying that it's probably the only way forward if you want western liberal democracy
406340	407340	to remain intact.
407340	412260	Frankly, it's the least amount of long-term suffering available to us, but our generation
412260	414460	is going to have to bear the largest cost.
414460	416500	Barrow 45 writes,
416500	419960	Democracy is non-negotiable.
419960	421140	And I replied,
421140	424740	Better dead than red.
424740	426340	iSmithy writes,
426340	427960	There has never been a capitalist society.
427960	431260	If you consider our modern civilization to be capitalist, you're wrong.
431260	435800	We live in a social democracy, which is a mixture of both capitalism and socialism.
435800	439320	So if you say that capitalism is the most successful structure, you must also agree
439320	443560	that socialism, which is integrated with this capitalism, is also just as successful.
443560	445680	Your definition of socialism is asinine.
445680	449040	There are many different forms of socialism aside from Marxism which don't involve seizing
449040	450720	the means of production and distribution.
450720	453000	Take the government and the entire public sector, for example.
453000	455160	The police, the army, these are all socialist.
455160	460040	Again, we live in a social democracy, which makes use of both socialism and capitalism.
460040	463400	A capitalist society would be immediately flawed because it would remove morality from
463400	464400	the government.
464400	467000	It would create a structure divided by money, equivalent to power.
467000	469240	Those with more money have power over those below them.
469240	472600	They would remove the concept of equal opportunity, they would remove the safety net that provides
472600	475000	a certain quality of life to all of a country's population.
475000	478880	Soon enough, we would fall into a dystopian oligarch with horrible living and working
478880	480600	conditions for the lower class.
480600	484440	You right-wingers make the claim that the free market results in self-regulation of
484440	486080	morality as well as economy.
486080	489400	This is a completely false claim that no credible economist has ever made.
489400	493160	During the industrial revolution, businesses had no qualms about using child labour.
493160	496960	They still have no issues polluting the environment, the air you breathe and the water you drink.
496960	500240	Without regulation, it would be the businesses that hold power and dictate morality rather
500240	501240	than the people.
501240	504040	And you would be stupid to rely on businesses in this way, especially considering the rise
504040	506640	of automation, which will continue to rapidly reduce employment.
506640	510960	The fact is that a country has to be regulated by a government, which means social integration.
510960	515160	Our idealism about capitalism is just as flawed as the idealism about Marxism was before
515160	516960	the uprising of the communists.
516960	520360	Now a few other people have posted similar comments, so I'm going to try to address
520360	521680	them all here.
521680	527280	This idea that a capitalist economy with government regulation is the same as socialism, or is
527280	531060	a capitalism and socialism mix, is simply incorrect.
531060	534180	Socialism refers to the social ownership of the means of production.
534180	535600	That is the definition.
535600	539320	And let's be frank, that means government ownership of the means of production because
539320	542480	the government is the representative of the people and you can't have a mob of people
542480	544880	owning shit without appointing some type of leader.
544880	549360	So in practicality, socialism does refer to government ownership of the means of production,
549360	553360	not government regulation or even partial government participation in the economy.
553360	555760	These are different ideas than socialism.
555760	559480	Government regulation is when private business is legally mandated to maintain a minimum
559480	561200	standard for the public good.
561200	565960	So things like health regulation on food is not government ownership of the means of production.
565960	569040	It's government regulation of the privately owned means of production.
569040	571000	This is not socialism.
571000	576080	Government partial participation in the economy is when private businesses exist and remain
576080	580260	private, but the government decides to use its own resources to build its own competitor
580260	581460	in that market.
581460	586680	So things like a national post service is not government ownership of the means of production.
586680	590920	The government has built its own means of production to compete alongside the privately
590920	595040	owned means still within the marketplace, but it has not seized those privately owned
595040	596580	means for its own use.
596580	598320	This is still not socialism.
598320	600480	Well, what is socialism then?
600480	603880	When government seizes ownership of the means of production, that means that the government
603880	606500	decides it owns all private business.
606500	609360	It does not build its own alternative to private business.
609360	611520	It does not regulate private business.
611520	617080	It takes over private business, often unjustly and without compensation to the owners of
617080	618140	that business.
618140	619560	This is socialism.
619560	624700	So when people talk about places like Canada or Sweden or the UK being socialist democracies
624700	629580	or combinations of capitalism and socialism, my only reply to that is just no.
629580	632220	Having a healthcare service is not socialism.
632220	633620	Regulation is not socialism.
633620	636060	These things are still within the realm of capitalism.
636060	640420	A total lack of these things refers to laissez-faire capitalism where the government simply does
640420	645020	not give a shit about the economy, but regulated capitalism is still capitalism.
645020	649620	In fact, a serious danger of laissez-faire capitalism and why capitalism needs regulation
649620	650940	is the concept of the monopoly.
650940	654940	A monopoly in a market where one competitor owns the entire market, or alternatively a
654940	658380	small group of competitors decide to stop competing with each other and rig the market
658380	662980	in their collective favour, represents a situation where unregulated capitalism fails to act
662980	664940	in the interest of the public good.
664940	667900	Regulation in this instance is the opposite of socialism.
667900	670980	Rather than the government owning the means of production, the government is forcing the
670980	675260	market to allow competitors to compete in situations where one competitor owns the entire
675260	679200	means of production, and all new competitors to the market can no longer function based
679200	680540	on the validity of their product.
680540	685420	If a society were socialist, it would simply seize the monopoly for itself, but regulated
685420	688540	capitalism intervenes to allow the market to function like a market again.
688540	691980	I'll be talking more about monopolies and regulation in the interest of the public good
691980	694060	in my upcoming video on net neutrality.
694060	697340	Béjourjour1 writes, why is theocracy not included?
697340	701260	I am not surprised somebody named Béjour is asking about a theocracy.
701260	705900	Marcus Rezegh writes, just a thought, similar to how real socialism has not been tried yet,
705900	709320	it feels like many capitalists, who climax at the thought of laissez-faire, argue the
709320	712200	same line when confronted with past and current problems of capitalism.
712200	716080	As if removing all regulations will somehow make all problems go away.
716080	721240	In my opinion, anybody who says real anything has not been tried yet can be safely dismissed.
721240	725200	Can you imagine the reaction if I said, real nazism has never been tried, it's obviously
725200	726640	a good system, let's just try it.
726640	728440	It would be pure fucking insanity, dude.
728440	732240	I don't know why everybody's willing to give the socialist this free pass, I'm certainly
732240	733240	not.
733240	734240	They're fucking immoral.
734240	738400	Alpha Potent writes, you refuted the anarchists, but what about the anarcho-capitalist perspective?
738480	742760	I mean, if the society agrees enough to vote in an uncapped majority, 50% already agree
742760	746760	with the NAP, so any revolutions are improbable since it's unlikely that in this day and
746760	749080	age a modern country would let its majority be suppressed.
749080	752680	Dude, I don't want to sit in my house and claim it as my property 24-7.
752680	756240	And don't say some shit like private security companies will do it for you, because those
756240	757280	won't exist.
757280	760180	Those people will have their own houses to take care of, they won't want to be there
760180	761400	protecting yours.
761400	766040	Unless of course, you intend to start giving them room and board at your place in compensation
766040	769560	for them defending your land, and oops, it looks like we've got feudalism all over
769560	770560	again.
770560	774080	Brocialist Party of America writes, uh, a lot of stuff.
774080	778160	This guy is quite literally the angry middle-class socialist Orwell described.
778160	781640	He's good for a laugh, but there's honestly not much to reply to here, there's so much
781640	782640	delusion.
782640	785800	Socialism doesn't believe in great works, reality says otherwise, you dumb piece of
785800	786800	shit.
786800	790020	Remind me again who developed the first satellite, put the first humans and animals in space
790020	792080	and invented cell phones and laser eye surgery?
792080	793720	The Soviet Union.
793720	798600	Remind me who did literally everything else, and on top of that, took all of those socialist
798600	801320	achievements and radically improved upon them.
801320	805280	And on top of that, has still managed to survive and pull more people out of poverty world
805280	806280	wide?
806280	807280	Yeah, that's capitalism.
807280	810960	I know that America, for example, is not happy about jobs going overseas.
810960	814440	But in the long term, for the bigger picture, it's actually a good thing that India and
814440	818520	China, two countries with some of the most grinding poverty on earth, also have some
818520	820800	of the fastest growing middle classes on earth.
820800	824920	It's not a bad thing that Chinese and Indian peasants are no longer starving and capitalism
824920	825920	did that.
825920	829800	The American class is awfully angry that it came off their backs and I don't blame them.
829800	831400	Their problems need solving as well.
831400	834240	But let's not pretend that world wide capitalism isn't helping people.
834240	835360	Well that's that, at least for now.
835360	838920	I'm going to be using some of the ideas and definitions from my capitalist video in the
838920	842020	upcoming net neutrality video, so if you haven't seen it yet you might want to go and brush
842020	843020	up on it.
843020	843840	I'll see you guys in a few days.
