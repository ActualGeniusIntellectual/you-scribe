0	9680	What does it mean to be indigenous? Well, like with most of these discussions,
9680	13520	let's start with a dictionary definition and then work our way down into the details from there.
13520	15680	Here's Merriam-Webster's first definition,
15680	20720	produced, growing, living, or occurring natively or naturally in a particular region or environment.
20720	26080	A secondary definition related to the first one is of or relating to the earliest known
26160	31360	inhabitants of a place and especially of a place that was colonized by a now dominant group.
31360	35840	In progressive-speak, indigenous seems to exclusively refer to the earliest inhabitants
35840	39840	of a place that has historically been colonized to the point that their civilizations have been
39840	43920	entirely destroyed, like the indigenous peoples of Canada, the United States, and Australia.
43920	47600	For the majority of the progressive movement's history, this did not refer to colonized peoples
47600	52240	whose civilizations didn't actually collapse, like people from India or China. This is why,
52240	57040	until it was recently replaced with the phrase global majority, the acronym BIPOC was commonly
57040	61440	used, standing for Black Indigenous Person of Color. There was a common understanding
61440	66080	that indigenous meant something different than just black or person of color. It was its own
66080	70560	thing. But in the past few years, the progressives have began to use the word indigenous a little
70560	75120	differently. The requirement that a historical indigenous society has to have collapsed during
75120	80480	colonialism has basically been expelled from the word. So, Indian people are indigenous to India,
80560	83520	and Chinese people are indigenous to China. Kind of.
83520	87040	See, to really understand what's going on here, we have to talk about a couple of other contexts
87040	90800	first. If you were to take a European and an American and have them talk about what
90800	95120	ethnicity means, you would likely get a lot of confusion. The talk between Sargon and Vosh
95120	100320	comes to mind. In an American context, a race basically just refers to a skin color and a broad
100320	104640	collection of facial features. White, black, Asian, Hispanic. And ethnicity, meanwhile,
104640	109280	is the genetic origin of a person. So, a white American might be descended from English settlers,
109280	113680	or French, or German, or Russian. And in an American context, their race would be white,
113680	117520	and their ethnicity would be, say, English. The reason this is how it works in America,
117520	122720	and frankly in most other new world nations as well, is because these are aspirational nations.
122720	127200	They are founded specifically on a tradition of immigration. The old cultural practices of the
127200	130880	various ethnicities of the immigrants become diluted over multiple generations and are
130880	135200	gradually replaced with a unifying American culture. The only thing that remains are the
135200	140160	broad physical markers. And so, English, French, German, Russian, all become white.
140160	144640	In the old world, though, ethnicity doesn't just refer to genetics. It can also refer to cultural
144640	149280	practices, or a historic homeland for a people, or a shared language or language group, sometimes
149280	153680	even a religious practice. What all of these have in common, though, is a sense of solidarity among
153680	158320	members of the group. A political mythology about where the group came from, what makes them them,
158320	162240	and what justifies their unification. A political myth doesn't need to be factually accurate,
162240	166400	though it often can be. It simply needs to be a story that a people tell themselves to explain
166400	170880	their existence. The American political myth is the revolution, and its hero is George Washington.
170880	174960	The Roman political myth was Romulus and Remus suckling at the wolf mother's teat. It doesn't
174960	179040	matter that one story is more factually accurate than the other. Both serve as the founding
179040	183520	political myth of their respective groups. From this point of view, practice and belief
183520	188000	is just as much a part of ethnicity as genetics is. Let's go back to our examples of India and
188000	191840	China. From an American point of view, where citizenship within a country is the identifiable
191840	196000	marker of being part of a people, Indians are indigenous to India and the Chinese are
196000	201600	indigenous to China, simple as. But that's not how those people view it. India has roughly 2,000
201600	206160	ethnic groups divided by language, religious differences, caste differences, and very little
206160	210800	of it has to do with skin color, something that defies American expectation. That's why India's
210800	215040	modern government is a federal one. A federation is specifically a type of country where partially
215040	219040	independent groups are united under a central government in an attempt to represent different
219040	223440	peoples and their competing interests. The concept of India as a united polity and the
223440	227840	Indian people as a broader ethnicity only came about as a consequence of rejecting British
227840	232320	colonial rule. Meanwhile in China, the dominant ethnicity, the Han, have been engaged in a
232320	236960	multi-millennia colonization project of Greater China. This process is called Sinification,
236960	242320	where non-Han Chinese are culturally encouraged to adopt Han customs, accept Han political rule,
242320	246400	interbreed with Han people, and ultimately become subsumed within the Han ethnicity.
246400	249680	This is what is currently happening with the Uyghur genocide. The Uyghurs aren't being
249680	253360	slaughtered in concentration camps like the Nazis did with the Jews, but they are undergoing
253360	257600	Sinification. Their cultural and religious practices are made illegal, their men are
257600	261920	forced into re-education centers, and their women are being forcibly married off to Han men by the
261920	266960	state. The acceptance of the Uyghur genocide as a genocide shows us that the old-world concept
266960	271680	of ethnicity is still considered the correct one. A genocide is the destruction of an ethnicity,
271680	275840	and if an ethnicity is only genetics, as the Americans like to claim, then the Uyghurs
275840	279360	aren't actually being genocide. Their genetics will continue to exist within their new Han
279360	284240	descendants. But an ethnicity is not just genetics. It is language, religion, cultural
284240	288320	practices, a sense of solidarity. Those are what is being destroyed by the Chinese state,
288320	292160	and that is why it's a genocide. Now, some particularly sneaky white
292160	296240	nationalists will take this understanding and make the claim that civic nationalism
296240	300800	is ethnic nationalism, that they are one and the same. Their logic is, if ethnicity is not only
300800	304720	genetics, but it's also cultural practices and language and the rest of it, and if civic
304720	309600	nationalism is defined as voluntary adoption of a nation-state's cultural principles by immigrants
309600	314560	who become citizens and integrate, then civic nationalism must be a form of ethnic nationalism.
314560	318720	Ethnic nationalism, in the non-civic sense, is when membership within a nation relies on
318720	323040	being a member of the ethnic group that nation rules over, like Germany for Germans or Britain
323040	326880	for the British or something. If your ethnic identity is an aspirational one, if you can
326880	330960	join it through cultural adoption, regardless of genetics, then there probably is a point to
330960	335920	that claim that civic nationalism is a type of ethnic nationalism. However, I will say that
335920	340160	nearly everybody that I've encountered personally who seriously makes this claim in public, in
340160	344880	private, has no problem with advocating for the mass death or deportation of anybody that they
344880	349440	consider to be ethnically undesirable, whether they're citizens or not. Leftoids hear dog whistles
349440	353920	everywhere, but in my personal experience, this one seems to ring true. While it's true that civic
353920	358480	nationalism is a type of ethnic nationalism, as both terms are defined, all ethnic nationalism
358480	362880	is not civic nationalism. When the white nationalists, or hell, the black nationalists too,
362880	366560	they're both chomping at the bit to oppress each other, claim that they want an ethnostate,
366560	370560	they're not talking about an aspirational ethnicity in the civic, integrative sense,
370560	374640	and their appealing to civic nationalism is simply a mot and bailey. That being said,
374640	378880	it is not necessarily the case that all states that are formed around an ethnicity are inherently
378880	383040	evil. One can point to Israel and notice the continual displacement and colonization of
383040	386960	Palestinians and call that bad, though it is up in the air how much of the crackdown Palestine
386960	390080	brings upon itself considering how much mutual hatred there is in that conflict.
390080	394640	But one can also point to Japan, a country with very strict immigration laws with a population
394640	399760	that is 97.8% Japanese, and you will see a very functional state that primarily serves the
399760	404160	interest of one ethnicity. Some people will say that Japan isn't actually an ethnostate because
404160	407920	non-Japanese people can move there, which is very difficult. Okay, fair enough. But to me,
407920	412000	that's just a word game. You can also call it a nation state. A nation state is a political unit
412000	415920	where the state and the nation are congruent. It is a more precise concept than a country,
415920	419840	since a country doesn't need a predominant ethnic group. A nation, in the sense of a common
419840	422960	ethnicity, may include a diaspora that lives outside the nation state. Okay, this is some
422960	426640	of the stuff I went over in my nationalism video. A state is a government that controls an area. A
426640	430880	nation is an ethnic group. A nation state is a government that controls an area that is considered
430880	434960	the historic homeland of an ethnic group, and often whose citizens are predominantly members
434960	438720	of that group. If you want to call what we're talking about nation states instead of ethnic
438720	442880	states, because the alt-right has made the term ethnostate refer to taking all the non-whites in
442880	446640	America and non-violently deporting them somehow because their ideas are retarded,
446640	450080	sure we can go with that. The point that I'm getting at with all of this stuff is,
450080	455200	if we accept the following premises. One, that a nation is an ethnic group. Two, that an ethnicity
455200	459840	is not just genetics, but language, culture, religion, all of which form a sense of solidarity
459840	464960	among group members. Three, that a political myth is the stories that the group tells itself
464960	470640	to justify that solidarity. Four, that ethnicities have historic homelands and have at least some
470640	475280	right to see their ethnicity continue into the future on that land, both in terms of genetics
475280	480320	and cultural practices. And five, that disrupting that right using the power of the state to
480320	486720	privilege a foreign ethnicity is an immoral act. What you'll find is these five premises form the
486720	491200	basis of progressive indigenous activism. This checklist applies to Indian rights movements in
491200	495120	the United States, Aboriginal movements in Canada and Australia, Palestinian rights in Israel,
495120	499280	Uyghurs in China, Indian ethnicities in India, all of the multitude of African ethnicities all
499280	503520	across the continent. All of it. The morality underpinning progressive indigenous activism
503520	507920	is the same morality that drove the adoption of the framework of the nation state beginning in
507920	512160	the 19th century. It wouldn't be a dev video without Twitter nonsense, so I want to go over
512160	517600	parts of this ridiculous thread by an indigenous anarchist witch lesbian twin spirit disabled
517600	521280	person. Yeah, disabled in more ways than one. I'm not going to read all of it because it's like
521280	524560	a hundred fucking posts, but if you want to read the whole thing, here it is, just pause the video.
524560	528800	But I want you to keep in mind everything we've talked about so far when it comes to ethnicities
528880	533200	and what it means to be indigenous to a location as we go over this. Some of her complaints are
533200	536960	reasonable, like where she says that it's racist to say you don't look native enough to be native,
536960	540800	or when she brings up blood quantum, which sounds a lot like a white form of signification,
540800	544640	so fair enough. Some of her complaints are retarded, like the cultural appropriation shit,
544640	548960	complaining about the use of costumes, or white people buying dream catchers, or the casual use
548960	553120	of herbs that indigenous people consider to be medicine. And some of her complaints expose the
553120	558160	weird reactionary nature of indigenous activists, spreading the debunked land bridge theory while
558160	562240	claiming that indigenous people were also immigrants or also colonizers so colonization
562240	566880	didn't matter. It's unscientific and based in racism, maybe you should just listen to our
566880	571520	communities about our origins and how long we've been here. The land bridge theory is the idea that
571520	575520	indigenous people of North and South America, as human beings, ultimately came out of Africa like
575520	579520	all of us, and so they got to the western hemisphere by crossing a land bridge between
579520	584640	Russia and Alaska that existed during the last ice age and vanished when the ice receded. All
584640	588640	archaeological evidence, as well as genetic examination of indigenous people in America
588640	592800	compared to people living in eastern Asia, make it highly likely that this is their actual origin.
592800	597760	But indigenous activists tend to completely reject this position. As a part of their culture and
597760	602080	their spirituality, they believe that they have an origin that is entirely separate from the rest of
602080	606480	humanity, that their ethnicity appeared on the earth through entirely different mechanisms than
606480	610640	all of the humans of the old world, which is why indigenous activists like this one often call the
610640	614960	land bridge theory debunked and view the claim that they are also immigrants to be racist,
614960	619040	because the actual science goes against their political myth and so disproving that myth is
619040	623040	attacking the ethnicity. The funniest part to me is that if you take all the rhetoric these people
623040	628640	use and swap the word indigenous for, say, German, you suddenly have the same blood and soil rhetoric
628640	633520	used as justification for the atrocities by some of the worst genociders of the 20th century.
633520	638240	And not just Hitler's rhetoric on gays and Jews, Mao's rhetoric on landlords and intellectuals,
638240	642800	Stalin's rhetoric on Ukrainians and kulaks, it all fits. Now, if I were your average
642800	646080	rightoid political pundit, I would make this comparison and end the video.
646080	650160	See guys, the indigenous activists are blood and soil Nazis. But because it's for the sake
650160	654880	of brown people instead of white people, the left thinks it's okay. While there are absolutely many
654880	658880	people on the left who do actually think this simply, who do think this is just okay, we can
658880	663280	be a little bit smarter than your average direction brain and keep digging down. What made the monsters
663280	668320	of the 20th century monsters is not that they use the same language as the indigenous activists,
668320	672720	language designed to separate themselves from the rest of humanity as a distinct ethnic polity with
672720	676800	specific rights to an ancestral homeland, meant to reinforce the political myth of their special
676800	681040	origins, whether it's the hyperbrian noble blooded giants for the Nazis or the great spirit for the
681040	686480	natives. No, it's what those monsters used that language to justify that matters. And I'm under
686480	691360	no delusion about what various radical non-white nationalist groups would do to white people if
691360	696960	given the chance. They do want the exact same type of horror. But we also have positive examples
696960	701280	of the nation state, where even though the majority of the population is of one ethnicity,
701280	705520	where one cultural standard is the normal, visitors are still certainly welcome to come
705520	709520	and experience and share that culture for themselves. Immigrants are welcome to if they
709520	713280	integrate and intermarry and become a part of the ethnicity, not like with China's signification,
713280	717920	but voluntarily because it's what they want to do. It doesn't have to be the case that just because
717920	722160	a state exists for the primary benefit of one nation, that all other peoples are going to be
722160	727440	expelled or exterminated, or that unending war will ravage everything everywhere. To be indigenous
727440	732560	in the old world sense means to be the ancestral people of an area that a modern state presides
732560	736720	over. And it's not unreasonable for that state to represent those people's interests. That's
736720	742080	what a nation state is. So since all of this is true, and we know that the left accepts it as true
742080	745840	based on everything I've told you, the logic as to why signification of the Uyghurs is bad,
745840	750240	the logic behind indigenous activism across the world, all of this stuff, then why is it the case
750240	755760	that when it comes to Europe specifically, we instead see this logic? The Sami are the EU's
755760	759680	only indigenous people. Since time immemorial, they have lived in an area stretching across
759680	764480	parts of four countries, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Russia. This area is called Satmi.
764480	769600	How is it possible that the Sami are Europe's only indigenous people? Are the French not indigenous
769600	774960	to France, the Germans to Germany? Are the English, Scots, Welsh, and Irish not the indigenous people
774960	779600	of the British Isles? Does indigenous just mean non-white now? The associated pictures show very
779600	783680	white-looking Sami people wearing traditional-styled clothing, hanging out in the snow with animals.
783680	787920	So does indigenous mean savage or living like a barbarian or something? That indigenous activist
787920	793440	from before wouldn't like that. Or is it the case that because the status of indigenous confers
793440	797840	moral authority among leftoids, the right to a homeland, the right to have special consideration
797840	801520	by the state that rules that homeland, the right to the preservation of their culture,
801520	805040	and all that other shit that's been stuffed into the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
805040	809760	Peoples? Is the reason that the indigenous peoples of Europe are not called indigenous
809760	814240	is specifically meant to deprive them of the rights associated with being indigenous to a
814240	818560	location? If all the articles within this UN Declaration were applied to the indigenous
818560	823200	populations of Europe, the progressives would cry racist so hard they would shit themselves.
823200	827680	Articles on cultural protection from outside influence, articles on local control of natural
827680	832320	resources and economic activity, articles on the ethnic makeup of their own institutions,
832320	837600	articles guaranteeing state assistance on ethnic grounds. This is all stuff that every rightoid
837600	841840	ethnostater wants for the white ethnostate. Now this comes from the UN, so it's not a law,
841840	846480	but a moral principle. And yet every single leftoid who thinks that this is a good idea,
846480	850400	they would never be caught saying that it is an appropriate moral principle for the indigenous
850400	856400	populations of Europe. The question then is, why? Why are the indigenous Europeans not considered
856400	860720	indigenous to Europe by progressives? Why are they not indigenous on European land?
860720	864880	Is it just anti-white or anti-European racism, like the EthnoNats claim? To be fair,
864880	867600	that's probably partially it. I know some progressives don't want to admit it,
867600	872080	but it's not hard to find various non-white groups who just hate white people, who view
872080	876480	members of their own race, who have children with whites to be traitors, all sorts of wild shit.
876480	881920	Some of this absolutely is just hatred of whites. They might couch it in revenge for colonization,
881920	885600	giving them the moral high ground to hate without remorse. But at the bottom of all of it,
885600	890640	it's just racism. But I don't think it's only racism. I also think it's part of the march of
890640	894800	progress. The nation-state is a 19th century innovation, and a lot of progressives have a
894800	898720	very deterministic way of looking at history. This is even more prevalent when you look at socialists,
898720	902880	who view history as dividing into clean economic eras, and that a transition from capitalism to
902880	907680	socialism is just as inevitable as the transition from feudalism to capitalism. This view, however,
907680	911520	is stupid, because history and technological advancement are not predetermined, like filling
911520	915280	out a tech tree in a game of civilization. The current progressive belief is that while
915280	919440	nation-states were once useful as a way to shake off the yolks of the old monarchies,
919440	923760	the true future, the next step of progress, is found in the cosmopolitan. No, not the magazine,
923760	927680	the way of living. Nation-states are backwards and oppressive, erecting artificial barriers
927680	930960	preventing cultures and peoples from mixing. This is why so many people on the left have
930960	934480	come around to the position that borders are racist, and anything less than unlimited
934480	938240	immigration is also racist. Forget about zero immigrants like the conservatives want. If you
938240	942240	advocate for 100,000 immigrants a year when you could do 200,000, you're a racist in the eyes of
942240	946960	the progs. Why? Because the march of progress means tearing down barriers and hierarchies,
946960	950960	and doing away with all tradition, whether or not it's useful. Now that the monarchies are gone,
950960	955280	the liberal apparatus of the nation-state is next, because change for the sake of change is
955280	960720	the progressive good. This runs much deeper than simple anti-white or anti-European hatred. It's
960720	965600	way more complicated than that. Progressives view all cultures mixing into an unidentifiable,
965600	971760	gray, universalized, cosmopolitan sludge as an a priori good, because then nobody is excluded
971760	976800	or offended by distinctive cultural practices. Standardization is the norm for ease of transport,
976800	980880	storage, and sale for pretty much every product. Every modern city looks like a wilderness of
980880	985120	brutalist glass and concrete. Entertainment is boring because to risk being different means
985120	989440	that someone might not like it, and that narrower appeal means less profits. Progressives know
989440	992720	exactly what I'm talking about. When it comes to being an individual, they will say,
992720	996960	if you sand off your rough edges, you lose what makes you you. And they say it so much that being
996960	1000960	a special snowflake became their stereotype. But they were fundamentally correct on some level.
1000960	1006000	The right tends to see this soulless, bland, universalized capitalism that waves a pride
1006000	1010720	flag once a month, emblematic of the modern era as fundamentally leftist in origin. The
1010720	1014480	leftists don't accept this, because it's not real socialism. But the rightists are more sophisticated
1014480	1018320	in their thinking on this topic. A conservative is particular to his culture, his practices,
1018320	1022560	and his aesthetic. None of it is universalized or standardized. A city full of progressives
1022560	1026880	looks like any other city, while a British town, a German town, a Russian town, and a Japanese town
1026880	1031200	look like they are particular to those locations. The fungible economics and politics that
1031200	1036080	progressives spend so much time decrying are caused by and come hand in hand with the
1036080	1041200	universalization of modern culture that progressives demand in order to make things more inclusive.
1041200	1045920	America and Canada are aspirational countries. To be ethnically Canadian simply means to
1045920	1049840	immigrate here and adopt Canadian customs and practices. Because Canada's nationalism
1049840	1054400	is civic nationalism. Why would I treat a black Canadian any differently than a white Canadian?
1054400	1058720	We're all Canadian, that's what matters. I'm not going to put my whiteness over my Canadian-ness.
1058720	1062800	And if he puts his blackness over his Canadian-ness, he's the problem.
1062800	1066480	Personally, I think this is a good way to run a country. But why does every country
1066480	1071200	need to be like mine? Should every country be aspirational like America and Canada?
1071200	1074880	Are you really British if you get a British passport and citizenship? Or are you just a
1074880	1078480	foreigner who's sticking around? What was your knee-jerk answer to that question in your head?
1078480	1082080	How about this one? Are you really Chinese if you get Chinese citizenship?
1082080	1086800	If your answer to those two questions is different, why? Both Britain and China have
1086800	1091680	indigenous populations that are still around. They're both a type of nation-state that should,
1091680	1096400	if the progressive logic is followed, grant their indigenous ethnicities special consideration.
1096400	1100400	I'm going to guess that if you're center-left leaning, because no radical leftoid would ever
1100400	1105520	watch my videos, the logic I presented felt right for Britain but wrong for China. Why?
1105520	1110000	Why did you knee-jerk Britain as an aspirational country, like the New World countries of America
1110000	1113760	and Canada are, rather than the traditional society that it is? Is it actually because
1113760	1117440	it's white, it's European? Is it because it's English-speaking? Is it because it's a former
1117440	1121600	colonial power? Is it because it's culturally similar to North America in some ways? Is it
1121600	1124960	because it's technologically advanced and militarily capable? Is it because it's one
1124960	1129680	of those countries that is considered to be on top, first world, G7, and therefore it can bear
1129680	1134480	the same short-term economic burden of immigration that other aspirational countries do? I mean,
1134480	1138640	I don't think it can, personally, if we look at figures on social welfare spending as compared
1138640	1142800	to immigration in the UK. Leftoid cries of, just throw more money at it, rings hollow,
1142800	1147520	especially if we're talking about the UK's housing crisis. England is already more densely populated
1147520	1152560	than India and Haiti. When conservatives say, we're full, there seems to be some truth to that,
1152560	1157440	and crying racism doesn't dispel this fact. My personal position on all of this should be obvious.
1157440	1160880	I'm fine with immigration, probably because I'm from a social contract society. As long as you
1160880	1165360	come here to be Canadian and not ghettoize and colonize, I don't care what race or ethnicity you
1165360	1170240	are. But I also understand that not everywhere is Canada, not everywhere is America. Why should the
1170240	1174880	nations of Europe, who do not have a tradition of immigration like we do, who do not have our space
1174880	1180000	and natural resources, be expected to engage with the world in the same way? Why should every square
1180000	1185840	inch of forest and countryside in Britain, France, Germany be bulldozed and turned into ugly Soviet
1185840	1191280	style apartment blocks to house new arrivals? We don't demand any other old world nation to place
1191280	1195360	the needs of foreigners above the needs of indigenous ethnic groups, whether they be in
1195360	1199760	Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and there does not seem to be any good reason to demand it of
1199760	1205040	European countries. While I have my problems with Sargon's sensible centrism, calling this
1205040	1210080	white nationalism is exceptionally stupid. If this is white nationalist, then Nigeria is a white
1210080	1214960	ethnostate, as Nigeria implements all of these policies. What this actually is, is the common
1214960	1219840	practices of any non-European nation state. Progressives don't do much objecting when the
1219840	1224160	rest of the world implements these policies, but they yell and scream something fierce when the
1224160	1228880	right wing of European nations suggests doing it. And it doesn't make me a Nazi or whatever to point
1228880	1233200	out that Europeans are indigenous to Europe, that their countries are nation states, not immigration
1233200	1237520	states. Those who benefit from European states disregarding the will of their own people,
1237520	1242320	namely immigration activists, have no problem pushing narratives that deconstructs the ethnic
1242320	1246960	identity of Europeans, saying that these places and people never truly existed as a polity anyway.
1246960	1251600	This is a line of logic that if it was employed back on them, would be blasted by progressives
1251600	1256240	as racist, and possibly genocidal. Therefore, there is no reason for us to tolerate it here
1256240	1260080	either. There is definitely a type of leftoid who would listen to this video with their brain
1260080	1263680	completely shut off, and come out of it thinking that I'm just a genocidal Nazi who wants to kill
1263680	1266880	non-white people. Those guys are retards, and they're never going to understand anything in
1266880	1270960	here anyway. I didn't say anything racist today. I didn't say anything in here regarding ethnic
1270960	1275440	supremacy, or advocating for mass deportation of a group, or any sort of extermination or racism,
1275440	1279440	or whatever. Like I said, I'm from Canada. I'm cool with immigration as long as immigrants come
1279440	1284640	here to be Canadian. I just don't expect nations with indigenous populations that still mostly
1284640	1290800	exist, unlike us, and like European nation states, to do what we do over here. So, what does it
1290800	1295600	actually mean to be indigenous? The rhetoric surrounding indigenous activism demonstrates
1295600	1300160	a glaring flaw in the progressive point of view when it comes to ethnicity. And it's deeper than
1300160	1304560	the whole hashtag land back is blood and soil Nazism, though that's a pretty fun meme to
1304560	1309120	sling around on Twitter sometimes. The real issue here is that there's one progressive value set,
1309120	1313280	the rights of indigenous peoples in their homeland, that is in direct conflict with a
1313280	1317280	second progressive value set, the drive to universalize cultures to include everybody
1317280	1321120	and eradicate racism, distinctions, differences, and hierarchies. The way that progressives have
1321120	1326800	solved this conflict between these two value sets is to de-indigenize Europeans in their own home,
1326800	1331600	a grotesque dehumanizing act that will likely prove to be terrible for the political stability
1331600	1336000	of those countries going forward. Personally, I'm not surprised that the European voter is turning
1336000	1340160	right wing after this series of events. If you ever wondered why I call myself a liberal,
1340160	1345440	but explicitly not a progressive, this racist nonsense is one big reason why.
