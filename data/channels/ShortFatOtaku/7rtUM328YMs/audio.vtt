00:00.000 --> 00:09.680
What does it mean to be indigenous? Well, like with most of these discussions,

00:09.680 --> 00:13.520
let's start with a dictionary definition and then work our way down into the details from there.

00:13.520 --> 00:15.680
Here's Merriam-Webster's first definition,

00:15.680 --> 00:20.720
produced, growing, living, or occurring natively or naturally in a particular region or environment.

00:20.720 --> 00:26.080
A secondary definition related to the first one is of or relating to the earliest known

00:26.160 --> 00:31.360
inhabitants of a place and especially of a place that was colonized by a now dominant group.

00:31.360 --> 00:35.840
In progressive-speak, indigenous seems to exclusively refer to the earliest inhabitants

00:35.840 --> 00:39.840
of a place that has historically been colonized to the point that their civilizations have been

00:39.840 --> 00:43.920
entirely destroyed, like the indigenous peoples of Canada, the United States, and Australia.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.600
For the majority of the progressive movement's history, this did not refer to colonized peoples

00:47.600 --> 00:52.240
whose civilizations didn't actually collapse, like people from India or China. This is why,

00:52.240 --> 00:57.040
until it was recently replaced with the phrase global majority, the acronym BIPOC was commonly

00:57.040 --> 01:01.440
used, standing for Black Indigenous Person of Color. There was a common understanding

01:01.440 --> 01:06.080
that indigenous meant something different than just black or person of color. It was its own

01:06.080 --> 01:10.560
thing. But in the past few years, the progressives have began to use the word indigenous a little

01:10.560 --> 01:15.120
differently. The requirement that a historical indigenous society has to have collapsed during

01:15.120 --> 01:20.480
colonialism has basically been expelled from the word. So, Indian people are indigenous to India,

01:20.560 --> 01:23.520
and Chinese people are indigenous to China. Kind of.

01:23.520 --> 01:27.040
See, to really understand what's going on here, we have to talk about a couple of other contexts

01:27.040 --> 01:30.800
first. If you were to take a European and an American and have them talk about what

01:30.800 --> 01:35.120
ethnicity means, you would likely get a lot of confusion. The talk between Sargon and Vosh

01:35.120 --> 01:40.320
comes to mind. In an American context, a race basically just refers to a skin color and a broad

01:40.320 --> 01:44.640
collection of facial features. White, black, Asian, Hispanic. And ethnicity, meanwhile,

01:44.640 --> 01:49.280
is the genetic origin of a person. So, a white American might be descended from English settlers,

01:49.280 --> 01:53.680
or French, or German, or Russian. And in an American context, their race would be white,

01:53.680 --> 01:57.520
and their ethnicity would be, say, English. The reason this is how it works in America,

01:57.520 --> 02:02.720
and frankly in most other new world nations as well, is because these are aspirational nations.

02:02.720 --> 02:07.200
They are founded specifically on a tradition of immigration. The old cultural practices of the

02:07.200 --> 02:10.880
various ethnicities of the immigrants become diluted over multiple generations and are

02:10.880 --> 02:15.200
gradually replaced with a unifying American culture. The only thing that remains are the

02:15.200 --> 02:20.160
broad physical markers. And so, English, French, German, Russian, all become white.

02:20.160 --> 02:24.640
In the old world, though, ethnicity doesn't just refer to genetics. It can also refer to cultural

02:24.640 --> 02:29.280
practices, or a historic homeland for a people, or a shared language or language group, sometimes

02:29.280 --> 02:33.680
even a religious practice. What all of these have in common, though, is a sense of solidarity among

02:33.680 --> 02:38.320
members of the group. A political mythology about where the group came from, what makes them them,

02:38.320 --> 02:42.240
and what justifies their unification. A political myth doesn't need to be factually accurate,

02:42.240 --> 02:46.400
though it often can be. It simply needs to be a story that a people tell themselves to explain

02:46.400 --> 02:50.880
their existence. The American political myth is the revolution, and its hero is George Washington.

02:50.880 --> 02:54.960
The Roman political myth was Romulus and Remus suckling at the wolf mother's teat. It doesn't

02:54.960 --> 02:59.040
matter that one story is more factually accurate than the other. Both serve as the founding

02:59.040 --> 03:03.520
political myth of their respective groups. From this point of view, practice and belief

03:03.520 --> 03:08.000
is just as much a part of ethnicity as genetics is. Let's go back to our examples of India and

03:08.000 --> 03:11.840
China. From an American point of view, where citizenship within a country is the identifiable

03:11.840 --> 03:16.000
marker of being part of a people, Indians are indigenous to India and the Chinese are

03:16.000 --> 03:21.600
indigenous to China, simple as. But that's not how those people view it. India has roughly 2,000

03:21.600 --> 03:26.160
ethnic groups divided by language, religious differences, caste differences, and very little

03:26.160 --> 03:30.800
of it has to do with skin color, something that defies American expectation. That's why India's

03:30.800 --> 03:35.040
modern government is a federal one. A federation is specifically a type of country where partially

03:35.040 --> 03:39.040
independent groups are united under a central government in an attempt to represent different

03:39.040 --> 03:43.440
peoples and their competing interests. The concept of India as a united polity and the

03:43.440 --> 03:47.840
Indian people as a broader ethnicity only came about as a consequence of rejecting British

03:47.840 --> 03:52.320
colonial rule. Meanwhile in China, the dominant ethnicity, the Han, have been engaged in a

03:52.320 --> 03:56.960
multi-millennia colonization project of Greater China. This process is called Sinification,

03:56.960 --> 04:02.320
where non-Han Chinese are culturally encouraged to adopt Han customs, accept Han political rule,

04:02.320 --> 04:06.400
interbreed with Han people, and ultimately become subsumed within the Han ethnicity.

04:06.400 --> 04:09.680
This is what is currently happening with the Uyghur genocide. The Uyghurs aren't being

04:09.680 --> 04:13.360
slaughtered in concentration camps like the Nazis did with the Jews, but they are undergoing

04:13.360 --> 04:17.600
Sinification. Their cultural and religious practices are made illegal, their men are

04:17.600 --> 04:21.920
forced into re-education centers, and their women are being forcibly married off to Han men by the

04:21.920 --> 04:26.960
state. The acceptance of the Uyghur genocide as a genocide shows us that the old-world concept

04:26.960 --> 04:31.680
of ethnicity is still considered the correct one. A genocide is the destruction of an ethnicity,

04:31.680 --> 04:35.840
and if an ethnicity is only genetics, as the Americans like to claim, then the Uyghurs

04:35.840 --> 04:39.360
aren't actually being genocide. Their genetics will continue to exist within their new Han

04:39.360 --> 04:44.240
descendants. But an ethnicity is not just genetics. It is language, religion, cultural

04:44.240 --> 04:48.320
practices, a sense of solidarity. Those are what is being destroyed by the Chinese state,

04:48.320 --> 04:52.160
and that is why it's a genocide. Now, some particularly sneaky white

04:52.160 --> 04:56.240
nationalists will take this understanding and make the claim that civic nationalism

04:56.240 --> 05:00.800
is ethnic nationalism, that they are one and the same. Their logic is, if ethnicity is not only

05:00.800 --> 05:04.720
genetics, but it's also cultural practices and language and the rest of it, and if civic

05:04.720 --> 05:09.600
nationalism is defined as voluntary adoption of a nation-state's cultural principles by immigrants

05:09.600 --> 05:14.560
who become citizens and integrate, then civic nationalism must be a form of ethnic nationalism.

05:14.560 --> 05:18.720
Ethnic nationalism, in the non-civic sense, is when membership within a nation relies on

05:18.720 --> 05:23.040
being a member of the ethnic group that nation rules over, like Germany for Germans or Britain

05:23.040 --> 05:26.880
for the British or something. If your ethnic identity is an aspirational one, if you can

05:26.880 --> 05:30.960
join it through cultural adoption, regardless of genetics, then there probably is a point to

05:30.960 --> 05:35.920
that claim that civic nationalism is a type of ethnic nationalism. However, I will say that

05:35.920 --> 05:40.160
nearly everybody that I've encountered personally who seriously makes this claim in public, in

05:40.160 --> 05:44.880
private, has no problem with advocating for the mass death or deportation of anybody that they

05:44.880 --> 05:49.440
consider to be ethnically undesirable, whether they're citizens or not. Leftoids hear dog whistles

05:49.440 --> 05:53.920
everywhere, but in my personal experience, this one seems to ring true. While it's true that civic

05:53.920 --> 05:58.480
nationalism is a type of ethnic nationalism, as both terms are defined, all ethnic nationalism

05:58.480 --> 06:02.880
is not civic nationalism. When the white nationalists, or hell, the black nationalists too,

06:02.880 --> 06:06.560
they're both chomping at the bit to oppress each other, claim that they want an ethnostate,

06:06.560 --> 06:10.560
they're not talking about an aspirational ethnicity in the civic, integrative sense,

06:10.560 --> 06:14.640
and their appealing to civic nationalism is simply a mot and bailey. That being said,

06:14.640 --> 06:18.880
it is not necessarily the case that all states that are formed around an ethnicity are inherently

06:18.880 --> 06:23.040
evil. One can point to Israel and notice the continual displacement and colonization of

06:23.040 --> 06:26.960
Palestinians and call that bad, though it is up in the air how much of the crackdown Palestine

06:26.960 --> 06:30.080
brings upon itself considering how much mutual hatred there is in that conflict.

06:30.080 --> 06:34.640
But one can also point to Japan, a country with very strict immigration laws with a population

06:34.640 --> 06:39.760
that is 97.8% Japanese, and you will see a very functional state that primarily serves the

06:39.760 --> 06:44.160
interest of one ethnicity. Some people will say that Japan isn't actually an ethnostate because

06:44.160 --> 06:47.920
non-Japanese people can move there, which is very difficult. Okay, fair enough. But to me,

06:47.920 --> 06:52.000
that's just a word game. You can also call it a nation state. A nation state is a political unit

06:52.000 --> 06:55.920
where the state and the nation are congruent. It is a more precise concept than a country,

06:55.920 --> 06:59.840
since a country doesn't need a predominant ethnic group. A nation, in the sense of a common

06:59.840 --> 07:02.960
ethnicity, may include a diaspora that lives outside the nation state. Okay, this is some

07:02.960 --> 07:06.640
of the stuff I went over in my nationalism video. A state is a government that controls an area. A

07:06.640 --> 07:10.880
nation is an ethnic group. A nation state is a government that controls an area that is considered

07:10.880 --> 07:14.960
the historic homeland of an ethnic group, and often whose citizens are predominantly members

07:14.960 --> 07:18.720
of that group. If you want to call what we're talking about nation states instead of ethnic

07:18.720 --> 07:22.880
states, because the alt-right has made the term ethnostate refer to taking all the non-whites in

07:22.880 --> 07:26.640
America and non-violently deporting them somehow because their ideas are retarded,

07:26.640 --> 07:30.080
sure we can go with that. The point that I'm getting at with all of this stuff is,

07:30.080 --> 07:35.200
if we accept the following premises. One, that a nation is an ethnic group. Two, that an ethnicity

07:35.200 --> 07:39.840
is not just genetics, but language, culture, religion, all of which form a sense of solidarity

07:39.840 --> 07:44.960
among group members. Three, that a political myth is the stories that the group tells itself

07:44.960 --> 07:50.640
to justify that solidarity. Four, that ethnicities have historic homelands and have at least some

07:50.640 --> 07:55.280
right to see their ethnicity continue into the future on that land, both in terms of genetics

07:55.280 --> 08:00.320
and cultural practices. And five, that disrupting that right using the power of the state to

08:00.320 --> 08:06.720
privilege a foreign ethnicity is an immoral act. What you'll find is these five premises form the

08:06.720 --> 08:11.200
basis of progressive indigenous activism. This checklist applies to Indian rights movements in

08:11.200 --> 08:15.120
the United States, Aboriginal movements in Canada and Australia, Palestinian rights in Israel,

08:15.120 --> 08:19.280
Uyghurs in China, Indian ethnicities in India, all of the multitude of African ethnicities all

08:19.280 --> 08:23.520
across the continent. All of it. The morality underpinning progressive indigenous activism

08:23.520 --> 08:27.920
is the same morality that drove the adoption of the framework of the nation state beginning in

08:27.920 --> 08:32.160
the 19th century. It wouldn't be a dev video without Twitter nonsense, so I want to go over

08:32.160 --> 08:37.600
parts of this ridiculous thread by an indigenous anarchist witch lesbian twin spirit disabled

08:37.600 --> 08:41.280
person. Yeah, disabled in more ways than one. I'm not going to read all of it because it's like

08:41.280 --> 08:44.560
a hundred fucking posts, but if you want to read the whole thing, here it is, just pause the video.

08:44.560 --> 08:48.800
But I want you to keep in mind everything we've talked about so far when it comes to ethnicities

08:48.880 --> 08:53.200
and what it means to be indigenous to a location as we go over this. Some of her complaints are

08:53.200 --> 08:56.960
reasonable, like where she says that it's racist to say you don't look native enough to be native,

08:56.960 --> 09:00.800
or when she brings up blood quantum, which sounds a lot like a white form of signification,

09:00.800 --> 09:04.640
so fair enough. Some of her complaints are retarded, like the cultural appropriation shit,

09:04.640 --> 09:08.960
complaining about the use of costumes, or white people buying dream catchers, or the casual use

09:08.960 --> 09:13.120
of herbs that indigenous people consider to be medicine. And some of her complaints expose the

09:13.120 --> 09:18.160
weird reactionary nature of indigenous activists, spreading the debunked land bridge theory while

09:18.160 --> 09:22.240
claiming that indigenous people were also immigrants or also colonizers so colonization

09:22.240 --> 09:26.880
didn't matter. It's unscientific and based in racism, maybe you should just listen to our

09:26.880 --> 09:31.520
communities about our origins and how long we've been here. The land bridge theory is the idea that

09:31.520 --> 09:35.520
indigenous people of North and South America, as human beings, ultimately came out of Africa like

09:35.520 --> 09:39.520
all of us, and so they got to the western hemisphere by crossing a land bridge between

09:39.520 --> 09:44.640
Russia and Alaska that existed during the last ice age and vanished when the ice receded. All

09:44.640 --> 09:48.640
archaeological evidence, as well as genetic examination of indigenous people in America

09:48.640 --> 09:52.800
compared to people living in eastern Asia, make it highly likely that this is their actual origin.

09:52.800 --> 09:57.760
But indigenous activists tend to completely reject this position. As a part of their culture and

09:57.760 --> 10:02.080
their spirituality, they believe that they have an origin that is entirely separate from the rest of

10:02.080 --> 10:06.480
humanity, that their ethnicity appeared on the earth through entirely different mechanisms than

10:06.480 --> 10:10.640
all of the humans of the old world, which is why indigenous activists like this one often call the

10:10.640 --> 10:14.960
land bridge theory debunked and view the claim that they are also immigrants to be racist,

10:14.960 --> 10:19.040
because the actual science goes against their political myth and so disproving that myth is

10:19.040 --> 10:23.040
attacking the ethnicity. The funniest part to me is that if you take all the rhetoric these people

10:23.040 --> 10:28.640
use and swap the word indigenous for, say, German, you suddenly have the same blood and soil rhetoric

10:28.640 --> 10:33.520
used as justification for the atrocities by some of the worst genociders of the 20th century.

10:33.520 --> 10:38.240
And not just Hitler's rhetoric on gays and Jews, Mao's rhetoric on landlords and intellectuals,

10:38.240 --> 10:42.800
Stalin's rhetoric on Ukrainians and kulaks, it all fits. Now, if I were your average

10:42.800 --> 10:46.080
rightoid political pundit, I would make this comparison and end the video.

10:46.080 --> 10:50.160
See guys, the indigenous activists are blood and soil Nazis. But because it's for the sake

10:50.160 --> 10:54.880
of brown people instead of white people, the left thinks it's okay. While there are absolutely many

10:54.880 --> 10:58.880
people on the left who do actually think this simply, who do think this is just okay, we can

10:58.880 --> 11:03.280
be a little bit smarter than your average direction brain and keep digging down. What made the monsters

11:03.280 --> 11:08.320
of the 20th century monsters is not that they use the same language as the indigenous activists,

11:08.320 --> 11:12.720
language designed to separate themselves from the rest of humanity as a distinct ethnic polity with

11:12.720 --> 11:16.800
specific rights to an ancestral homeland, meant to reinforce the political myth of their special

11:16.800 --> 11:21.040
origins, whether it's the hyperbrian noble blooded giants for the Nazis or the great spirit for the

11:21.040 --> 11:26.480
natives. No, it's what those monsters used that language to justify that matters. And I'm under

11:26.480 --> 11:31.360
no delusion about what various radical non-white nationalist groups would do to white people if

11:31.360 --> 11:36.960
given the chance. They do want the exact same type of horror. But we also have positive examples

11:36.960 --> 11:41.280
of the nation state, where even though the majority of the population is of one ethnicity,

11:41.280 --> 11:45.520
where one cultural standard is the normal, visitors are still certainly welcome to come

11:45.520 --> 11:49.520
and experience and share that culture for themselves. Immigrants are welcome to if they

11:49.520 --> 11:53.280
integrate and intermarry and become a part of the ethnicity, not like with China's signification,

11:53.280 --> 11:57.920
but voluntarily because it's what they want to do. It doesn't have to be the case that just because

11:57.920 --> 12:02.160
a state exists for the primary benefit of one nation, that all other peoples are going to be

12:02.160 --> 12:07.440
expelled or exterminated, or that unending war will ravage everything everywhere. To be indigenous

12:07.440 --> 12:12.560
in the old world sense means to be the ancestral people of an area that a modern state presides

12:12.560 --> 12:16.720
over. And it's not unreasonable for that state to represent those people's interests. That's

12:16.720 --> 12:22.080
what a nation state is. So since all of this is true, and we know that the left accepts it as true

12:22.080 --> 12:25.840
based on everything I've told you, the logic as to why signification of the Uyghurs is bad,

12:25.840 --> 12:30.240
the logic behind indigenous activism across the world, all of this stuff, then why is it the case

12:30.240 --> 12:35.760
that when it comes to Europe specifically, we instead see this logic? The Sami are the EU's

12:35.760 --> 12:39.680
only indigenous people. Since time immemorial, they have lived in an area stretching across

12:39.680 --> 12:44.480
parts of four countries, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Russia. This area is called Satmi.

12:44.480 --> 12:49.600
How is it possible that the Sami are Europe's only indigenous people? Are the French not indigenous

12:49.600 --> 12:54.960
to France, the Germans to Germany? Are the English, Scots, Welsh, and Irish not the indigenous people

12:54.960 --> 12:59.600
of the British Isles? Does indigenous just mean non-white now? The associated pictures show very

12:59.600 --> 13:03.680
white-looking Sami people wearing traditional-styled clothing, hanging out in the snow with animals.

13:03.680 --> 13:07.920
So does indigenous mean savage or living like a barbarian or something? That indigenous activist

13:07.920 --> 13:13.440
from before wouldn't like that. Or is it the case that because the status of indigenous confers

13:13.440 --> 13:17.840
moral authority among leftoids, the right to a homeland, the right to have special consideration

13:17.840 --> 13:21.520
by the state that rules that homeland, the right to the preservation of their culture,

13:21.520 --> 13:25.040
and all that other shit that's been stuffed into the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous

13:25.040 --> 13:29.760
Peoples? Is the reason that the indigenous peoples of Europe are not called indigenous

13:29.760 --> 13:34.240
is specifically meant to deprive them of the rights associated with being indigenous to a

13:34.240 --> 13:38.560
location? If all the articles within this UN Declaration were applied to the indigenous

13:38.560 --> 13:43.200
populations of Europe, the progressives would cry racist so hard they would shit themselves.

13:43.200 --> 13:47.680
Articles on cultural protection from outside influence, articles on local control of natural

13:47.680 --> 13:52.320
resources and economic activity, articles on the ethnic makeup of their own institutions,

13:52.320 --> 13:57.600
articles guaranteeing state assistance on ethnic grounds. This is all stuff that every rightoid

13:57.600 --> 14:01.840
ethnostater wants for the white ethnostate. Now this comes from the UN, so it's not a law,

14:01.840 --> 14:06.480
but a moral principle. And yet every single leftoid who thinks that this is a good idea,

14:06.480 --> 14:10.400
they would never be caught saying that it is an appropriate moral principle for the indigenous

14:10.400 --> 14:16.400
populations of Europe. The question then is, why? Why are the indigenous Europeans not considered

14:16.400 --> 14:20.720
indigenous to Europe by progressives? Why are they not indigenous on European land?

14:20.720 --> 14:24.880
Is it just anti-white or anti-European racism, like the EthnoNats claim? To be fair,

14:24.880 --> 14:27.600
that's probably partially it. I know some progressives don't want to admit it,

14:27.600 --> 14:32.080
but it's not hard to find various non-white groups who just hate white people, who view

14:32.080 --> 14:36.480
members of their own race, who have children with whites to be traitors, all sorts of wild shit.

14:36.480 --> 14:41.920
Some of this absolutely is just hatred of whites. They might couch it in revenge for colonization,

14:41.920 --> 14:45.600
giving them the moral high ground to hate without remorse. But at the bottom of all of it,

14:45.600 --> 14:50.640
it's just racism. But I don't think it's only racism. I also think it's part of the march of

14:50.640 --> 14:54.800
progress. The nation-state is a 19th century innovation, and a lot of progressives have a

14:54.800 --> 14:58.720
very deterministic way of looking at history. This is even more prevalent when you look at socialists,

14:58.720 --> 15:02.880
who view history as dividing into clean economic eras, and that a transition from capitalism to

15:02.880 --> 15:07.680
socialism is just as inevitable as the transition from feudalism to capitalism. This view, however,

15:07.680 --> 15:11.520
is stupid, because history and technological advancement are not predetermined, like filling

15:11.520 --> 15:15.280
out a tech tree in a game of civilization. The current progressive belief is that while

15:15.280 --> 15:19.440
nation-states were once useful as a way to shake off the yolks of the old monarchies,

15:19.440 --> 15:23.760
the true future, the next step of progress, is found in the cosmopolitan. No, not the magazine,

15:23.760 --> 15:27.680
the way of living. Nation-states are backwards and oppressive, erecting artificial barriers

15:27.680 --> 15:30.960
preventing cultures and peoples from mixing. This is why so many people on the left have

15:30.960 --> 15:34.480
come around to the position that borders are racist, and anything less than unlimited

15:34.480 --> 15:38.240
immigration is also racist. Forget about zero immigrants like the conservatives want. If you

15:38.240 --> 15:42.240
advocate for 100,000 immigrants a year when you could do 200,000, you're a racist in the eyes of

15:42.240 --> 15:46.960
the progs. Why? Because the march of progress means tearing down barriers and hierarchies,

15:46.960 --> 15:50.960
and doing away with all tradition, whether or not it's useful. Now that the monarchies are gone,

15:50.960 --> 15:55.280
the liberal apparatus of the nation-state is next, because change for the sake of change is

15:55.280 --> 16:00.720
the progressive good. This runs much deeper than simple anti-white or anti-European hatred. It's

16:00.720 --> 16:05.600
way more complicated than that. Progressives view all cultures mixing into an unidentifiable,

16:05.600 --> 16:11.760
gray, universalized, cosmopolitan sludge as an a priori good, because then nobody is excluded

16:11.760 --> 16:16.800
or offended by distinctive cultural practices. Standardization is the norm for ease of transport,

16:16.800 --> 16:20.880
storage, and sale for pretty much every product. Every modern city looks like a wilderness of

16:20.880 --> 16:25.120
brutalist glass and concrete. Entertainment is boring because to risk being different means

16:25.120 --> 16:29.440
that someone might not like it, and that narrower appeal means less profits. Progressives know

16:29.440 --> 16:32.720
exactly what I'm talking about. When it comes to being an individual, they will say,

16:32.720 --> 16:36.960
if you sand off your rough edges, you lose what makes you you. And they say it so much that being

16:36.960 --> 16:40.960
a special snowflake became their stereotype. But they were fundamentally correct on some level.

16:40.960 --> 16:46.000
The right tends to see this soulless, bland, universalized capitalism that waves a pride

16:46.000 --> 16:50.720
flag once a month, emblematic of the modern era as fundamentally leftist in origin. The

16:50.720 --> 16:54.480
leftists don't accept this, because it's not real socialism. But the rightists are more sophisticated

16:54.480 --> 16:58.320
in their thinking on this topic. A conservative is particular to his culture, his practices,

16:58.320 --> 17:02.560
and his aesthetic. None of it is universalized or standardized. A city full of progressives

17:02.560 --> 17:06.880
looks like any other city, while a British town, a German town, a Russian town, and a Japanese town

17:06.880 --> 17:11.200
look like they are particular to those locations. The fungible economics and politics that

17:11.200 --> 17:16.080
progressives spend so much time decrying are caused by and come hand in hand with the

17:16.080 --> 17:21.200
universalization of modern culture that progressives demand in order to make things more inclusive.

17:21.200 --> 17:25.920
America and Canada are aspirational countries. To be ethnically Canadian simply means to

17:25.920 --> 17:29.840
immigrate here and adopt Canadian customs and practices. Because Canada's nationalism

17:29.840 --> 17:34.400
is civic nationalism. Why would I treat a black Canadian any differently than a white Canadian?

17:34.400 --> 17:38.720
We're all Canadian, that's what matters. I'm not going to put my whiteness over my Canadian-ness.

17:38.720 --> 17:42.800
And if he puts his blackness over his Canadian-ness, he's the problem.

17:42.800 --> 17:46.480
Personally, I think this is a good way to run a country. But why does every country

17:46.480 --> 17:51.200
need to be like mine? Should every country be aspirational like America and Canada?

17:51.200 --> 17:54.880
Are you really British if you get a British passport and citizenship? Or are you just a

17:54.880 --> 17:58.480
foreigner who's sticking around? What was your knee-jerk answer to that question in your head?

17:58.480 --> 18:02.080
How about this one? Are you really Chinese if you get Chinese citizenship?

18:02.080 --> 18:06.800
If your answer to those two questions is different, why? Both Britain and China have

18:06.800 --> 18:11.680
indigenous populations that are still around. They're both a type of nation-state that should,

18:11.680 --> 18:16.400
if the progressive logic is followed, grant their indigenous ethnicities special consideration.

18:16.400 --> 18:20.400
I'm going to guess that if you're center-left leaning, because no radical leftoid would ever

18:20.400 --> 18:25.520
watch my videos, the logic I presented felt right for Britain but wrong for China. Why?

18:25.520 --> 18:30.000
Why did you knee-jerk Britain as an aspirational country, like the New World countries of America

18:30.000 --> 18:33.760
and Canada are, rather than the traditional society that it is? Is it actually because

18:33.760 --> 18:37.440
it's white, it's European? Is it because it's English-speaking? Is it because it's a former

18:37.440 --> 18:41.600
colonial power? Is it because it's culturally similar to North America in some ways? Is it

18:41.600 --> 18:44.960
because it's technologically advanced and militarily capable? Is it because it's one

18:44.960 --> 18:49.680
of those countries that is considered to be on top, first world, G7, and therefore it can bear

18:49.680 --> 18:54.480
the same short-term economic burden of immigration that other aspirational countries do? I mean,

18:54.480 --> 18:58.640
I don't think it can, personally, if we look at figures on social welfare spending as compared

18:58.640 --> 19:02.800
to immigration in the UK. Leftoid cries of, just throw more money at it, rings hollow,

19:02.800 --> 19:07.520
especially if we're talking about the UK's housing crisis. England is already more densely populated

19:07.520 --> 19:12.560
than India and Haiti. When conservatives say, we're full, there seems to be some truth to that,

19:12.560 --> 19:17.440
and crying racism doesn't dispel this fact. My personal position on all of this should be obvious.

19:17.440 --> 19:20.880
I'm fine with immigration, probably because I'm from a social contract society. As long as you

19:20.880 --> 19:25.360
come here to be Canadian and not ghettoize and colonize, I don't care what race or ethnicity you

19:25.360 --> 19:30.240
are. But I also understand that not everywhere is Canada, not everywhere is America. Why should the

19:30.240 --> 19:34.880
nations of Europe, who do not have a tradition of immigration like we do, who do not have our space

19:34.880 --> 19:40.000
and natural resources, be expected to engage with the world in the same way? Why should every square

19:40.000 --> 19:45.840
inch of forest and countryside in Britain, France, Germany be bulldozed and turned into ugly Soviet

19:45.840 --> 19:51.280
style apartment blocks to house new arrivals? We don't demand any other old world nation to place

19:51.280 --> 19:55.360
the needs of foreigners above the needs of indigenous ethnic groups, whether they be in

19:55.360 --> 19:59.760
Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and there does not seem to be any good reason to demand it of

19:59.760 --> 20:05.040
European countries. While I have my problems with Sargon's sensible centrism, calling this

20:05.040 --> 20:10.080
white nationalism is exceptionally stupid. If this is white nationalist, then Nigeria is a white

20:10.080 --> 20:14.960
ethnostate, as Nigeria implements all of these policies. What this actually is, is the common

20:14.960 --> 20:19.840
practices of any non-European nation state. Progressives don't do much objecting when the

20:19.840 --> 20:24.160
rest of the world implements these policies, but they yell and scream something fierce when the

20:24.160 --> 20:28.880
right wing of European nations suggests doing it. And it doesn't make me a Nazi or whatever to point

20:28.880 --> 20:33.200
out that Europeans are indigenous to Europe, that their countries are nation states, not immigration

20:33.200 --> 20:37.520
states. Those who benefit from European states disregarding the will of their own people,

20:37.520 --> 20:42.320
namely immigration activists, have no problem pushing narratives that deconstructs the ethnic

20:42.320 --> 20:46.960
identity of Europeans, saying that these places and people never truly existed as a polity anyway.

20:46.960 --> 20:51.600
This is a line of logic that if it was employed back on them, would be blasted by progressives

20:51.600 --> 20:56.240
as racist, and possibly genocidal. Therefore, there is no reason for us to tolerate it here

20:56.240 --> 21:00.080
either. There is definitely a type of leftoid who would listen to this video with their brain

21:00.080 --> 21:03.680
completely shut off, and come out of it thinking that I'm just a genocidal Nazi who wants to kill

21:03.680 --> 21:06.880
non-white people. Those guys are retards, and they're never going to understand anything in

21:06.880 --> 21:10.960
here anyway. I didn't say anything racist today. I didn't say anything in here regarding ethnic

21:10.960 --> 21:15.440
supremacy, or advocating for mass deportation of a group, or any sort of extermination or racism,

21:15.440 --> 21:19.440
or whatever. Like I said, I'm from Canada. I'm cool with immigration as long as immigrants come

21:19.440 --> 21:24.640
here to be Canadian. I just don't expect nations with indigenous populations that still mostly

21:24.640 --> 21:30.800
exist, unlike us, and like European nation states, to do what we do over here. So, what does it

21:30.800 --> 21:35.600
actually mean to be indigenous? The rhetoric surrounding indigenous activism demonstrates

21:35.600 --> 21:40.160
a glaring flaw in the progressive point of view when it comes to ethnicity. And it's deeper than

21:40.160 --> 21:44.560
the whole hashtag land back is blood and soil Nazism, though that's a pretty fun meme to

21:44.560 --> 21:49.120
sling around on Twitter sometimes. The real issue here is that there's one progressive value set,

21:49.120 --> 21:53.280
the rights of indigenous peoples in their homeland, that is in direct conflict with a

21:53.280 --> 21:57.280
second progressive value set, the drive to universalize cultures to include everybody

21:57.280 --> 22:01.120
and eradicate racism, distinctions, differences, and hierarchies. The way that progressives have

22:01.120 --> 22:06.800
solved this conflict between these two value sets is to de-indigenize Europeans in their own home,

22:06.800 --> 22:11.600
a grotesque dehumanizing act that will likely prove to be terrible for the political stability

22:11.600 --> 22:16.000
of those countries going forward. Personally, I'm not surprised that the European voter is turning

22:16.000 --> 22:20.160
right wing after this series of events. If you ever wondered why I call myself a liberal,

22:20.160 --> 22:25.440
but explicitly not a progressive, this racist nonsense is one big reason why.
