1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,680
What does it mean to be indigenous? Well, like with most of these discussions,

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,520
let's start with a dictionary definition and then work our way down into the details from there.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,680
Here's Merriam-Webster's first definition,

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,720
produced, growing, living, or occurring natively or naturally in a particular region or environment.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,080
A secondary definition related to the first one is of or relating to the earliest known

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,360
inhabitants of a place and especially of a place that was colonized by a now dominant group.

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,840
In progressive-speak, indigenous seems to exclusively refer to the earliest inhabitants

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,840
of a place that has historically been colonized to the point that their civilizations have been

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,920
entirely destroyed, like the indigenous peoples of Canada, the United States, and Australia.

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,600
For the majority of the progressive movement's history, this did not refer to colonized peoples

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,240
whose civilizations didn't actually collapse, like people from India or China. This is why,

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,040
until it was recently replaced with the phrase global majority, the acronym BIPOC was commonly

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,440
used, standing for Black Indigenous Person of Color. There was a common understanding

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,080
that indigenous meant something different than just black or person of color. It was its own

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,560
thing. But in the past few years, the progressives have began to use the word indigenous a little

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,120
differently. The requirement that a historical indigenous society has to have collapsed during

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,480
colonialism has basically been expelled from the word. So, Indian people are indigenous to India,

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,520
and Chinese people are indigenous to China. Kind of.

19
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,040
See, to really understand what's going on here, we have to talk about a couple of other contexts

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,800
first. If you were to take a European and an American and have them talk about what

21
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,120
ethnicity means, you would likely get a lot of confusion. The talk between Sargon and Vosh

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,320
comes to mind. In an American context, a race basically just refers to a skin color and a broad

23
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,640
collection of facial features. White, black, Asian, Hispanic. And ethnicity, meanwhile,

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,280
is the genetic origin of a person. So, a white American might be descended from English settlers,

25
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,680
or French, or German, or Russian. And in an American context, their race would be white,

26
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,520
and their ethnicity would be, say, English. The reason this is how it works in America,

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,720
and frankly in most other new world nations as well, is because these are aspirational nations.

28
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,200
They are founded specifically on a tradition of immigration. The old cultural practices of the

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,880
various ethnicities of the immigrants become diluted over multiple generations and are

30
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,200
gradually replaced with a unifying American culture. The only thing that remains are the

31
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,160
broad physical markers. And so, English, French, German, Russian, all become white.

32
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,640
In the old world, though, ethnicity doesn't just refer to genetics. It can also refer to cultural

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,280
practices, or a historic homeland for a people, or a shared language or language group, sometimes

34
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,680
even a religious practice. What all of these have in common, though, is a sense of solidarity among

35
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,320
members of the group. A political mythology about where the group came from, what makes them them,

36
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,240
and what justifies their unification. A political myth doesn't need to be factually accurate,

37
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,400
though it often can be. It simply needs to be a story that a people tell themselves to explain

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,880
their existence. The American political myth is the revolution, and its hero is George Washington.

39
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,960
The Roman political myth was Romulus and Remus suckling at the wolf mother's teat. It doesn't

40
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,040
matter that one story is more factually accurate than the other. Both serve as the founding

41
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,520
political myth of their respective groups. From this point of view, practice and belief

42
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,000
is just as much a part of ethnicity as genetics is. Let's go back to our examples of India and

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,840
China. From an American point of view, where citizenship within a country is the identifiable

44
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,000
marker of being part of a people, Indians are indigenous to India and the Chinese are

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,600
indigenous to China, simple as. But that's not how those people view it. India has roughly 2,000

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,160
ethnic groups divided by language, religious differences, caste differences, and very little

47
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,800
of it has to do with skin color, something that defies American expectation. That's why India's

48
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,040
modern government is a federal one. A federation is specifically a type of country where partially

49
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,040
independent groups are united under a central government in an attempt to represent different

50
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,440
peoples and their competing interests. The concept of India as a united polity and the

51
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,840
Indian people as a broader ethnicity only came about as a consequence of rejecting British

52
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,320
colonial rule. Meanwhile in China, the dominant ethnicity, the Han, have been engaged in a

53
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,960
multi-millennia colonization project of Greater China. This process is called Sinification,

54
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,320
where non-Han Chinese are culturally encouraged to adopt Han customs, accept Han political rule,

55
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,400
interbreed with Han people, and ultimately become subsumed within the Han ethnicity.

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,680
This is what is currently happening with the Uyghur genocide. The Uyghurs aren't being

57
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,360
slaughtered in concentration camps like the Nazis did with the Jews, but they are undergoing

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,600
Sinification. Their cultural and religious practices are made illegal, their men are

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,920
forced into re-education centers, and their women are being forcibly married off to Han men by the

60
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,960
state. The acceptance of the Uyghur genocide as a genocide shows us that the old-world concept

61
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,680
of ethnicity is still considered the correct one. A genocide is the destruction of an ethnicity,

62
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,840
and if an ethnicity is only genetics, as the Americans like to claim, then the Uyghurs

63
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,360
aren't actually being genocide. Their genetics will continue to exist within their new Han

64
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,240
descendants. But an ethnicity is not just genetics. It is language, religion, cultural

65
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,320
practices, a sense of solidarity. Those are what is being destroyed by the Chinese state,

66
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,160
and that is why it's a genocide. Now, some particularly sneaky white

67
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,240
nationalists will take this understanding and make the claim that civic nationalism

68
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,800
is ethnic nationalism, that they are one and the same. Their logic is, if ethnicity is not only

69
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,720
genetics, but it's also cultural practices and language and the rest of it, and if civic

70
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,600
nationalism is defined as voluntary adoption of a nation-state's cultural principles by immigrants

71
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,560
who become citizens and integrate, then civic nationalism must be a form of ethnic nationalism.

72
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,720
Ethnic nationalism, in the non-civic sense, is when membership within a nation relies on

73
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,040
being a member of the ethnic group that nation rules over, like Germany for Germans or Britain

74
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,880
for the British or something. If your ethnic identity is an aspirational one, if you can

75
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,960
join it through cultural adoption, regardless of genetics, then there probably is a point to

76
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,920
that claim that civic nationalism is a type of ethnic nationalism. However, I will say that

77
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,160
nearly everybody that I've encountered personally who seriously makes this claim in public, in

78
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,880
private, has no problem with advocating for the mass death or deportation of anybody that they

79
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,440
consider to be ethnically undesirable, whether they're citizens or not. Leftoids hear dog whistles

80
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,920
everywhere, but in my personal experience, this one seems to ring true. While it's true that civic

81
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,480
nationalism is a type of ethnic nationalism, as both terms are defined, all ethnic nationalism

82
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,880
is not civic nationalism. When the white nationalists, or hell, the black nationalists too,

83
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,560
they're both chomping at the bit to oppress each other, claim that they want an ethnostate,

84
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,560
they're not talking about an aspirational ethnicity in the civic, integrative sense,

85
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,640
and their appealing to civic nationalism is simply a mot and bailey. That being said,

86
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,880
it is not necessarily the case that all states that are formed around an ethnicity are inherently

87
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,040
evil. One can point to Israel and notice the continual displacement and colonization of

88
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,960
Palestinians and call that bad, though it is up in the air how much of the crackdown Palestine

89
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,080
brings upon itself considering how much mutual hatred there is in that conflict.

90
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,640
But one can also point to Japan, a country with very strict immigration laws with a population

91
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,760
that is 97.8% Japanese, and you will see a very functional state that primarily serves the

92
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,160
interest of one ethnicity. Some people will say that Japan isn't actually an ethnostate because

93
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,920
non-Japanese people can move there, which is very difficult. Okay, fair enough. But to me,

94
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,000
that's just a word game. You can also call it a nation state. A nation state is a political unit

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,920
where the state and the nation are congruent. It is a more precise concept than a country,

96
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,840
since a country doesn't need a predominant ethnic group. A nation, in the sense of a common

97
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,960
ethnicity, may include a diaspora that lives outside the nation state. Okay, this is some

98
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,640
of the stuff I went over in my nationalism video. A state is a government that controls an area. A

99
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,880
nation is an ethnic group. A nation state is a government that controls an area that is considered

100
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,960
the historic homeland of an ethnic group, and often whose citizens are predominantly members

101
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,720
of that group. If you want to call what we're talking about nation states instead of ethnic

102
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,880
states, because the alt-right has made the term ethnostate refer to taking all the non-whites in

103
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,640
America and non-violently deporting them somehow because their ideas are retarded,

104
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,080
sure we can go with that. The point that I'm getting at with all of this stuff is,

105
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,200
if we accept the following premises. One, that a nation is an ethnic group. Two, that an ethnicity

106
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,840
is not just genetics, but language, culture, religion, all of which form a sense of solidarity

107
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,960
among group members. Three, that a political myth is the stories that the group tells itself

108
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,640
to justify that solidarity. Four, that ethnicities have historic homelands and have at least some

109
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,280
right to see their ethnicity continue into the future on that land, both in terms of genetics

110
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,320
and cultural practices. And five, that disrupting that right using the power of the state to

111
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:06,720
privilege a foreign ethnicity is an immoral act. What you'll find is these five premises form the

112
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,200
basis of progressive indigenous activism. This checklist applies to Indian rights movements in

113
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,120
the United States, Aboriginal movements in Canada and Australia, Palestinian rights in Israel,

114
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,280
Uyghurs in China, Indian ethnicities in India, all of the multitude of African ethnicities all

115
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,520
across the continent. All of it. The morality underpinning progressive indigenous activism

116
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,920
is the same morality that drove the adoption of the framework of the nation state beginning in

117
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,160
the 19th century. It wouldn't be a dev video without Twitter nonsense, so I want to go over

118
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,600
parts of this ridiculous thread by an indigenous anarchist witch lesbian twin spirit disabled

119
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,280
person. Yeah, disabled in more ways than one. I'm not going to read all of it because it's like

120
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,560
a hundred fucking posts, but if you want to read the whole thing, here it is, just pause the video.

121
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,800
But I want you to keep in mind everything we've talked about so far when it comes to ethnicities

122
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,200
and what it means to be indigenous to a location as we go over this. Some of her complaints are

123
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,960
reasonable, like where she says that it's racist to say you don't look native enough to be native,

124
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,800
or when she brings up blood quantum, which sounds a lot like a white form of signification,

125
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,640
so fair enough. Some of her complaints are retarded, like the cultural appropriation shit,

126
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,960
complaining about the use of costumes, or white people buying dream catchers, or the casual use

127
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,120
of herbs that indigenous people consider to be medicine. And some of her complaints expose the

128
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,160
weird reactionary nature of indigenous activists, spreading the debunked land bridge theory while

129
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,240
claiming that indigenous people were also immigrants or also colonizers so colonization

130
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,880
didn't matter. It's unscientific and based in racism, maybe you should just listen to our

131
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,520
communities about our origins and how long we've been here. The land bridge theory is the idea that

132
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,520
indigenous people of North and South America, as human beings, ultimately came out of Africa like

133
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,520
all of us, and so they got to the western hemisphere by crossing a land bridge between

134
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,640
Russia and Alaska that existed during the last ice age and vanished when the ice receded. All

135
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,640
archaeological evidence, as well as genetic examination of indigenous people in America

136
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,800
compared to people living in eastern Asia, make it highly likely that this is their actual origin.

137
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,760
But indigenous activists tend to completely reject this position. As a part of their culture and

138
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,080
their spirituality, they believe that they have an origin that is entirely separate from the rest of

139
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,480
humanity, that their ethnicity appeared on the earth through entirely different mechanisms than

140
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,640
all of the humans of the old world, which is why indigenous activists like this one often call the

141
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,960
land bridge theory debunked and view the claim that they are also immigrants to be racist,

142
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,040
because the actual science goes against their political myth and so disproving that myth is

143
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,040
attacking the ethnicity. The funniest part to me is that if you take all the rhetoric these people

144
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,640
use and swap the word indigenous for, say, German, you suddenly have the same blood and soil rhetoric

145
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,520
used as justification for the atrocities by some of the worst genociders of the 20th century.

146
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,240
And not just Hitler's rhetoric on gays and Jews, Mao's rhetoric on landlords and intellectuals,

147
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,800
Stalin's rhetoric on Ukrainians and kulaks, it all fits. Now, if I were your average

148
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,080
rightoid political pundit, I would make this comparison and end the video.

149
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,160
See guys, the indigenous activists are blood and soil Nazis. But because it's for the sake

150
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,880
of brown people instead of white people, the left thinks it's okay. While there are absolutely many

151
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,880
people on the left who do actually think this simply, who do think this is just okay, we can

152
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,280
be a little bit smarter than your average direction brain and keep digging down. What made the monsters

153
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,320
of the 20th century monsters is not that they use the same language as the indigenous activists,

154
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,720
language designed to separate themselves from the rest of humanity as a distinct ethnic polity with

155
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,800
specific rights to an ancestral homeland, meant to reinforce the political myth of their special

156
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,040
origins, whether it's the hyperbrian noble blooded giants for the Nazis or the great spirit for the

157
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,480
natives. No, it's what those monsters used that language to justify that matters. And I'm under

158
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,360
no delusion about what various radical non-white nationalist groups would do to white people if

159
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,960
given the chance. They do want the exact same type of horror. But we also have positive examples

160
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,280
of the nation state, where even though the majority of the population is of one ethnicity,

161
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,520
where one cultural standard is the normal, visitors are still certainly welcome to come

162
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,520
and experience and share that culture for themselves. Immigrants are welcome to if they

163
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,280
integrate and intermarry and become a part of the ethnicity, not like with China's signification,

164
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,920
but voluntarily because it's what they want to do. It doesn't have to be the case that just because

165
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,160
a state exists for the primary benefit of one nation, that all other peoples are going to be

166
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,440
expelled or exterminated, or that unending war will ravage everything everywhere. To be indigenous

167
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,560
in the old world sense means to be the ancestral people of an area that a modern state presides

168
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,720
over. And it's not unreasonable for that state to represent those people's interests. That's

169
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,080
what a nation state is. So since all of this is true, and we know that the left accepts it as true

170
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,840
based on everything I've told you, the logic as to why signification of the Uyghurs is bad,

171
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,240
the logic behind indigenous activism across the world, all of this stuff, then why is it the case

172
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,760
that when it comes to Europe specifically, we instead see this logic? The Sami are the EU's

173
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,680
only indigenous people. Since time immemorial, they have lived in an area stretching across

174
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,480
parts of four countries, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Russia. This area is called Satmi.

175
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,600
How is it possible that the Sami are Europe's only indigenous people? Are the French not indigenous

176
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,960
to France, the Germans to Germany? Are the English, Scots, Welsh, and Irish not the indigenous people

177
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,600
of the British Isles? Does indigenous just mean non-white now? The associated pictures show very

178
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,680
white-looking Sami people wearing traditional-styled clothing, hanging out in the snow with animals.

179
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,920
So does indigenous mean savage or living like a barbarian or something? That indigenous activist

180
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,440
from before wouldn't like that. Or is it the case that because the status of indigenous confers

181
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,840
moral authority among leftoids, the right to a homeland, the right to have special consideration

182
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,520
by the state that rules that homeland, the right to the preservation of their culture,

183
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,040
and all that other shit that's been stuffed into the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous

184
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,760
Peoples? Is the reason that the indigenous peoples of Europe are not called indigenous

185
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,240
is specifically meant to deprive them of the rights associated with being indigenous to a

186
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,560
location? If all the articles within this UN Declaration were applied to the indigenous

187
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,200
populations of Europe, the progressives would cry racist so hard they would shit themselves.

188
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,680
Articles on cultural protection from outside influence, articles on local control of natural

189
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,320
resources and economic activity, articles on the ethnic makeup of their own institutions,

190
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,600
articles guaranteeing state assistance on ethnic grounds. This is all stuff that every rightoid

191
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,840
ethnostater wants for the white ethnostate. Now this comes from the UN, so it's not a law,

192
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,480
but a moral principle. And yet every single leftoid who thinks that this is a good idea,

193
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,400
they would never be caught saying that it is an appropriate moral principle for the indigenous

194
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:16,400
populations of Europe. The question then is, why? Why are the indigenous Europeans not considered

195
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,720
indigenous to Europe by progressives? Why are they not indigenous on European land?

196
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,880
Is it just anti-white or anti-European racism, like the EthnoNats claim? To be fair,

197
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,600
that's probably partially it. I know some progressives don't want to admit it,

198
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,080
but it's not hard to find various non-white groups who just hate white people, who view

199
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,480
members of their own race, who have children with whites to be traitors, all sorts of wild shit.

200
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,920
Some of this absolutely is just hatred of whites. They might couch it in revenge for colonization,

201
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,600
giving them the moral high ground to hate without remorse. But at the bottom of all of it,

202
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,640
it's just racism. But I don't think it's only racism. I also think it's part of the march of

203
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,800
progress. The nation-state is a 19th century innovation, and a lot of progressives have a

204
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,720
very deterministic way of looking at history. This is even more prevalent when you look at socialists,

205
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,880
who view history as dividing into clean economic eras, and that a transition from capitalism to

206
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,680
socialism is just as inevitable as the transition from feudalism to capitalism. This view, however,

207
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,520
is stupid, because history and technological advancement are not predetermined, like filling

208
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,280
out a tech tree in a game of civilization. The current progressive belief is that while

209
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,440
nation-states were once useful as a way to shake off the yolks of the old monarchies,

210
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,760
the true future, the next step of progress, is found in the cosmopolitan. No, not the magazine,

211
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,680
the way of living. Nation-states are backwards and oppressive, erecting artificial barriers

212
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,960
preventing cultures and peoples from mixing. This is why so many people on the left have

213
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,480
come around to the position that borders are racist, and anything less than unlimited

214
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,240
immigration is also racist. Forget about zero immigrants like the conservatives want. If you

215
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,240
advocate for 100,000 immigrants a year when you could do 200,000, you're a racist in the eyes of

216
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,960
the progs. Why? Because the march of progress means tearing down barriers and hierarchies,

217
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,960
and doing away with all tradition, whether or not it's useful. Now that the monarchies are gone,

218
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,280
the liberal apparatus of the nation-state is next, because change for the sake of change is

219
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,720
the progressive good. This runs much deeper than simple anti-white or anti-European hatred. It's

220
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,600
way more complicated than that. Progressives view all cultures mixing into an unidentifiable,

221
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,760
gray, universalized, cosmopolitan sludge as an a priori good, because then nobody is excluded

222
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,800
or offended by distinctive cultural practices. Standardization is the norm for ease of transport,

223
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,880
storage, and sale for pretty much every product. Every modern city looks like a wilderness of

224
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,120
brutalist glass and concrete. Entertainment is boring because to risk being different means

225
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,440
that someone might not like it, and that narrower appeal means less profits. Progressives know

226
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,720
exactly what I'm talking about. When it comes to being an individual, they will say,

227
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,960
if you sand off your rough edges, you lose what makes you you. And they say it so much that being

228
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,960
a special snowflake became their stereotype. But they were fundamentally correct on some level.

229
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:46,000
The right tends to see this soulless, bland, universalized capitalism that waves a pride

230
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,720
flag once a month, emblematic of the modern era as fundamentally leftist in origin. The

231
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,480
leftists don't accept this, because it's not real socialism. But the rightists are more sophisticated

232
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,320
in their thinking on this topic. A conservative is particular to his culture, his practices,

233
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,560
and his aesthetic. None of it is universalized or standardized. A city full of progressives

234
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,880
looks like any other city, while a British town, a German town, a Russian town, and a Japanese town

235
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,200
look like they are particular to those locations. The fungible economics and politics that

236
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,080
progressives spend so much time decrying are caused by and come hand in hand with the

237
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:21,200
universalization of modern culture that progressives demand in order to make things more inclusive.

238
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,920
America and Canada are aspirational countries. To be ethnically Canadian simply means to

239
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,840
immigrate here and adopt Canadian customs and practices. Because Canada's nationalism

240
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,400
is civic nationalism. Why would I treat a black Canadian any differently than a white Canadian?

241
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,720
We're all Canadian, that's what matters. I'm not going to put my whiteness over my Canadian-ness.

242
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,800
And if he puts his blackness over his Canadian-ness, he's the problem.

243
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,480
Personally, I think this is a good way to run a country. But why does every country

244
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,200
need to be like mine? Should every country be aspirational like America and Canada?

245
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,880
Are you really British if you get a British passport and citizenship? Or are you just a

246
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,480
foreigner who's sticking around? What was your knee-jerk answer to that question in your head?

247
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,080
How about this one? Are you really Chinese if you get Chinese citizenship?

248
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,800
If your answer to those two questions is different, why? Both Britain and China have

249
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,680
indigenous populations that are still around. They're both a type of nation-state that should,

250
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,400
if the progressive logic is followed, grant their indigenous ethnicities special consideration.

251
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,400
I'm going to guess that if you're center-left leaning, because no radical leftoid would ever

252
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,520
watch my videos, the logic I presented felt right for Britain but wrong for China. Why?

253
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,000
Why did you knee-jerk Britain as an aspirational country, like the New World countries of America

254
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,760
and Canada are, rather than the traditional society that it is? Is it actually because

255
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,440
it's white, it's European? Is it because it's English-speaking? Is it because it's a former

256
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,600
colonial power? Is it because it's culturally similar to North America in some ways? Is it

257
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,960
because it's technologically advanced and militarily capable? Is it because it's one

258
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,680
of those countries that is considered to be on top, first world, G7, and therefore it can bear

259
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,480
the same short-term economic burden of immigration that other aspirational countries do? I mean,

260
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,640
I don't think it can, personally, if we look at figures on social welfare spending as compared

261
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,800
to immigration in the UK. Leftoid cries of, just throw more money at it, rings hollow,

262
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,520
especially if we're talking about the UK's housing crisis. England is already more densely populated

263
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,560
than India and Haiti. When conservatives say, we're full, there seems to be some truth to that,

264
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,440
and crying racism doesn't dispel this fact. My personal position on all of this should be obvious.

265
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,880
I'm fine with immigration, probably because I'm from a social contract society. As long as you

266
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,360
come here to be Canadian and not ghettoize and colonize, I don't care what race or ethnicity you

267
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,240
are. But I also understand that not everywhere is Canada, not everywhere is America. Why should the

268
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,880
nations of Europe, who do not have a tradition of immigration like we do, who do not have our space

269
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,000
and natural resources, be expected to engage with the world in the same way? Why should every square

270
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,840
inch of forest and countryside in Britain, France, Germany be bulldozed and turned into ugly Soviet

271
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,280
style apartment blocks to house new arrivals? We don't demand any other old world nation to place

272
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,360
the needs of foreigners above the needs of indigenous ethnic groups, whether they be in

273
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,760
Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and there does not seem to be any good reason to demand it of

274
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,040
European countries. While I have my problems with Sargon's sensible centrism, calling this

275
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,080
white nationalism is exceptionally stupid. If this is white nationalist, then Nigeria is a white

276
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,960
ethnostate, as Nigeria implements all of these policies. What this actually is, is the common

277
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,840
practices of any non-European nation state. Progressives don't do much objecting when the

278
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,160
rest of the world implements these policies, but they yell and scream something fierce when the

279
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,880
right wing of European nations suggests doing it. And it doesn't make me a Nazi or whatever to point

280
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,200
out that Europeans are indigenous to Europe, that their countries are nation states, not immigration

281
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,520
states. Those who benefit from European states disregarding the will of their own people,

282
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,320
namely immigration activists, have no problem pushing narratives that deconstructs the ethnic

283
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,960
identity of Europeans, saying that these places and people never truly existed as a polity anyway.

284
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,600
This is a line of logic that if it was employed back on them, would be blasted by progressives

285
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,240
as racist, and possibly genocidal. Therefore, there is no reason for us to tolerate it here

286
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,080
either. There is definitely a type of leftoid who would listen to this video with their brain

287
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,680
completely shut off, and come out of it thinking that I'm just a genocidal Nazi who wants to kill

288
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,880
non-white people. Those guys are retards, and they're never going to understand anything in

289
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,960
here anyway. I didn't say anything racist today. I didn't say anything in here regarding ethnic

290
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,440
supremacy, or advocating for mass deportation of a group, or any sort of extermination or racism,

291
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,440
or whatever. Like I said, I'm from Canada. I'm cool with immigration as long as immigrants come

292
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,640
here to be Canadian. I just don't expect nations with indigenous populations that still mostly

293
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,800
exist, unlike us, and like European nation states, to do what we do over here. So, what does it

294
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,600
actually mean to be indigenous? The rhetoric surrounding indigenous activism demonstrates

295
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,160
a glaring flaw in the progressive point of view when it comes to ethnicity. And it's deeper than

296
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,560
the whole hashtag land back is blood and soil Nazism, though that's a pretty fun meme to

297
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,120
sling around on Twitter sometimes. The real issue here is that there's one progressive value set,

298
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,280
the rights of indigenous peoples in their homeland, that is in direct conflict with a

299
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,280
second progressive value set, the drive to universalize cultures to include everybody

300
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,120
and eradicate racism, distinctions, differences, and hierarchies. The way that progressives have

301
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,800
solved this conflict between these two value sets is to de-indigenize Europeans in their own home,

302
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,600
a grotesque dehumanizing act that will likely prove to be terrible for the political stability

303
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,000
of those countries going forward. Personally, I'm not surprised that the European voter is turning

304
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,160
right wing after this series of events. If you ever wondered why I call myself a liberal,

305
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,440
but explicitly not a progressive, this racist nonsense is one big reason why.
