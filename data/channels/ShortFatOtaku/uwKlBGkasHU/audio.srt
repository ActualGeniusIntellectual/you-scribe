1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,760
I'm in a real gay man's dilemma. Do I get Botox for my whole to reduce fissures slash

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,620
allow me to bottom more but take on the risk of shitting myself in public?

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,540
You know, I had some hopes of this being a serious YouTube channel one day. I was talking

4
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,140
about a name change to something that's more suited to my current analytical style.

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,420
I did that video examining why leftists tend to hate charity. I've got our video coming

6
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,780
down the pipe describing the three forms of fascism and what lands in my lap today

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,660
but Botoxing your butthole. As always, this ain't getting monetized so please toss a few

8
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,660
dollars my way.

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,780
I think the first thing that I need to ask is if you're getting fucked so much that you've

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,700
got anal fissures, maybe the first thing on the list is to, you know, take a break from

11
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:56,380
the gay sex, not inject Botox into your asshole to loosen it up and keep the good times rolling.

12
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,460
How deep is this Botox going legitimately asking as a medical student just in the sphincter

13
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,580
to make it relax. It's generally done if you get a lot of fissures. Oh, it's generally

14
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,180
done like this is some kind of common procedure most normal people get no big deal. Jesus

15
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,060
Christ. I don't like to bottom because of the fissures I get every single time. I know

16
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,300
I get torn up and it's the worst like what the fuck guys do you not use lube? This sounds

17
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,620
like they're fucking animals that have barbed dicks. I'm way too tight to get more than

18
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,740
a finger up there. Then why are you doing it? Jesus forget about that that degeneracy

19
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,540
gay sex is icky angle that I'm sure a lot of my audience is currently feeling right

20
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,580
now. There's also a practical conversation here. There's ways to loosen up before you

21
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,420
get into taking cocks in the ass man. You don't need to fly hole first onto the thickest

22
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:49,040
shaft in the room. And just in case you think this is about say two loving monogamous gay

23
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,380
men in a closed relationship who are having some sexual problems that require medical

24
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,580
intervention that sometimes happens to straight couples to like the dicks too big or whatever.

25
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,940
Nope. This is just about being a degenerate. It's more about healing things below. I'm

26
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,460
not doing shit for a top. Yep, this guy doesn't give a shit about who he's having sex with,

27
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,900
which might be one of the reasons why he's having this problem. You know, in an age of

28
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,360
monkey pox being spread by promiscuous gay sex, and the data is finally conclusively

29
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,680
in on that one, by the way, guys, it's not that incidental contact with sweat or pus

30
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,880
or saliva that happens during sex sometimes that is spreading monkey pox right now. Rather

31
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,900
monkey pox is being spread specifically through semen. You think that the gays would tone

32
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:34,640
it down, not tear it up. Literally. Alright, let's give this guy the benefit of the doubt.

33
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,640
For those wondering, Botox paralyzes muscles and if used on the sphincter will help it

34
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,720
relax and allow fissures to heal more easily. Also, I get Botox in the top of my head and

35
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,080
neck to help with migraines. It won't make your hole look 10 years younger. I already

36
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,280
passed. If you have a fissure, doctors can give you a compound prescription ointment

37
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,480
that increases blood flow to the area. Do not use hemorrhoid cream. It does the opposite.

38
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,000
Jesus, imagine that conversation with your doctor. Yes, sir. I love getting ass fucked

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,160
so much. You got to prescribe me some anal cream. But Botox can help relax the sphincter

40
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,340
speeding up healing. If it causes incontinence, you will tighten up in two to three months.

41
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,680
So yeah, literally choosing to shit yourself in order to have sex. I appreciate the discourse

42
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,740
and how vulnerable people have been sharing their struggles with bottoming, fissures and

43
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,720
IBS. The ridicule and vitriol I've received exemplifies the stigma around this. Do not

44
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,560
be ashamed. You are not alone. Thank you for the overwhelming love and support. Dude. Okay,

45
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,000
let's put the promiscuity thing aside for a minute. If I personally ever had any sort

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,880
of medical problem like this, none of you would ever know about it because I know what's

47
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,120
appropriate to post on social media and what's appropriate to keep within my private life.

48
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,600
It is proper that there is a barrier between your public and personal spheres. Not everybody

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,720
needs to know everything you've ever done. In other words, TMI buddy. Moreover, the reason

50
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,080
you're getting ridiculed is because what you are saying is ridiculous. Like I'm kind of

51
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,660
a comedian, right? Not a very good one, I guess, but I don't mind doing goofier videos

52
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,000
sometimes or telling jokes or making a fool out of myself on stream. I do that sort of

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,120
thing more on the gaming channel than here, but I'm still not purely serious 100% of the

54
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,720
time. I know my job. I'm fundamentally an entertainer and my content has to be either

55
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,040
interesting or funny to get you to watch it. I can absolutely picture a series of jokes

56
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,060
on stream where I talk about injecting my asshole with Botox in order to increase the

57
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,040
amount of anal sex I can have and exactly how fast the chat room would be scrolling

58
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,100
in response. They would be laughing at me and that's the point. The joke is that I would

59
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,660
sound ridiculous, but I'd be doing it as a joke. You're actually out here saying this

60
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,400
shit seriously. How could you be anything other than a laughing stock, dude? Here's

61
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,680
the worst part about this whole topic. This actually isn't the first time that Botoxing

62
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,320
your butthole has gone viral. Nope, the internet's seen this one before. Vice.com, March 29th,

63
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,040
2017. Anal rejuvenation is making works of art out of American butts. From skin tag removal

64
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,080
to tightening procedures to anal Botox, how a new class of doctors is making bottoming

65
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,600
its top priority. Alright, I'm a fascist now. You won me over. I just wanted to play fucking

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,000
video games. In 2010, Tom went to see a surgeon about getting skin tags removed around his

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,060
anus. As a sexually active gay man, this wasn't just a routine cleanup, more like

68
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:17,060
a fresh coat of paint on a bed and breakfast with frequent visitors. Ultimately, the surgeon

69
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:22,720
he saw not only removed them, but took internal hemorrhoids and anal dysplasia or precancerous

70
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,240
cells along with them. Jesus Christ. I don't know if it works like this, but when you have

71
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,460
so much anal sex, you start to get cancer. But Tom said the surgeon was more aggressive

72
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,560
than he needed to be and didn't consider that his butthole was also a sexual organ.

73
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,640
It was horrific, the 48-year-old said. I was on the sofa for three months in horrible pain.

74
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,600
It was six years ago, and I still can't have anal sex comfortably, which has destroyed

75
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,280
50% of my sexuality. I can't explain the emotional toil it took on me. About a year ago, Tom

76
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,960
found Dr. Evan Goldstein, the founder of Bespoke Surgical and a leading practitioner in the

77
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,400
burgeoning field of anal rejuvenation. I told him, look, if I can't get fucked, at least

78
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,760
make my butthole look pretty. And he did. Goldstein said his private practice really

79
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,840
started booming about five years ago when patients started asking for more lickable,

80
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:19,320
playable holes. And just in case you're curious, people are dropping up to $25,000 a shot on

81
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,240
Dr. Goldstein's anal botox. That's a lot of money you could have saved by not fucking

82
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,080
yourself into physical ruin. I feel the same way with women who get plastic

83
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,400
surgery in their vaginas. Like, chill the fuck out with that. Unless you've got Cthulhu

84
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,000
down there, I don't think anybody actually cares. But for some reason, getting vaginal

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,080
re-sculpting and reshaping and whatever the fuck, that seems to be on the rise too, and

86
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,760
that's just as ridiculous. Unrelated to either the 2017 Vice article

87
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:48,580
or the recent viral tweet by, uh, Sloppy Scorpio, is this article on TheBody.com, which bills

88
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,140
itself as the internet's HIV slash AIDS resource. Now, I've been told many times over the years

89
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,260
that considering AIDS as a gay disease or whatever is bigoted, and fair enough. But

90
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,340
if that's the case, why the hell does an AIDS resource site have so many articles that

91
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,440
focus on gay sex? Anyway, the article is titled, Is Anal Botox

92
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,620
a Miracle for Painful Bottoming? And I'm just here thinking, dude, if you've got AIDS, maybe

93
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,780
you just fucked it up a bit too much. Maybe your sex life should just be over at that

94
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,560
point. But finally, after many wasted hours trying

95
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,960
to get to the bottom of this story for this video, we can finally drill down to some core

96
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,860
nugget of truth. Specifically in the preamble of this article before the anal botox bit.

97
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,000
I got my first botox injections two months ago. As an expressive 32-year-old gay man,

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,200
I've been flirting with the idea of preventative facial botox for a few years now, crossing

99
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,360
the threshold of 30 years old, had ignited a deep existential dread, and I decided to

100
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,440
pull the trigger after a friend told me he could get me a lofty discount. Needless to

101
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,080
say, I'm thrilled with the results, though you could never tell because my face is frozen

102
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,280
and I plan to keep it that way. Thank you very much.

103
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,400
The author of this article, Bobby Box, is certainly a handsome man who appears to be

104
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,260
doing well for himself, at least based off his TikTok account. Same with that sloppy

105
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,660
Scorpio dude at the beginning of the video. Same with a lot of the guys featured in my

106
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:06,560
previous monkey pox video. But they all have the same basic attitude. You can smell the

107
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,680
extreme fear of getting older, wafting off of them. This existential dread, as Box says

108
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,500
in the article. I've seen many porn stars, OnlyFans women, and prostitutes all say the

109
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,380
same thing on the female side of the conversation. They all inevitably ask, though very rarely

110
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,760
publicly. When the looks fade, then what? Red Pillars already have a pre-set script

111
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,400
for that conversation with women. The beauty of youth fades, so you need to find a man

112
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,320
who has some value and have children and build a life for yourself. Something that will persist

113
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,120
for the entirety of your life, not just the early years. And fair enough, that's one

114
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,520
very common and very successful way to do it. You don't commonly see men feeling this

115
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,720
way, though. At least not like this. Of course, men feel the ravages of time as well. I'm

116
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,360
sure one day I will be middle-aged, looking in the bathroom mirror, wondering what happened

117
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,060
to the person that I was, pining for those younger years. That happens to all of us,

118
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,060
at least a little bit. But you can save off that existential dread by being a responsible

119
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,260
father and an attentive husband. Or by building a business that others can be lifted out of

120
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,500
poverty and wage slavery into. Or by devoting yourself to a charitable cause and making

121
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,580
your community better. Or by working in your job in an honest manner and applying yourself

122
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,900
diligently and establishing yourself as a person to trust when things go sideways. Or

123
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,740
how about all of these things? At least, as many of them as you can manage. Meaning is

124
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,520
found in voluntarily taking up responsibility, and it's meaning that staves off existential

125
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,320
dread. It will be the meaning of a well-lived life that is your final companion on your

126
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,440
deathbed. If your life is so fucking empty that you need to inject Botox into your face

127
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,920
because you're afraid of getting old, and Botox into your butthole because the only

128
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,660
thing you have to look forward to is meaningless sex, well, that sounds like a terrible life

129
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,000
to me. And if you're the type of weird person who just happens to find that sort of thing

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,460
truly fulfilling, then all the power to you. But do you think it's these guys? Do you

131
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,200
think the person who writes about turning 30 and getting Botox to cope with it really

132
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,980
loves his life deep down? Yes, these people are ridiculous and disgusting and hilarious,

133
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,140
but when you peel the layers back, you find that they're also insecure and desperate

134
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,140
and sad. This isn't even a gay thing in the end, it's a nihilism thing. Though there's

135
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,520
clearly a lot of overlap there, the gay men in monogamous responsible relationships with

136
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,300
well-rounded careers and lives likely do not suffer from quite the same existential problems

137
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,120
as these guys. Anyway, I have no idea how to end this video, so don't fucking Botox

138
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,040
your butthole. Bye!
