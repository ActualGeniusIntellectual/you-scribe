00:00.000 --> 00:11.760
I'm in a real gay man's dilemma. Do I get Botox for my whole to reduce fissures slash

00:11.760 --> 00:16.620
allow me to bottom more but take on the risk of shitting myself in public?

00:16.620 --> 00:21.540
You know, I had some hopes of this being a serious YouTube channel one day. I was talking

00:21.540 --> 00:25.140
about a name change to something that's more suited to my current analytical style.

00:25.140 --> 00:29.420
I did that video examining why leftists tend to hate charity. I've got our video coming

00:29.420 --> 00:33.780
down the pipe describing the three forms of fascism and what lands in my lap today

00:33.780 --> 00:38.660
but Botoxing your butthole. As always, this ain't getting monetized so please toss a few

00:38.660 --> 00:39.660
dollars my way.

00:39.660 --> 00:44.780
I think the first thing that I need to ask is if you're getting fucked so much that you've

00:44.780 --> 00:49.700
got anal fissures, maybe the first thing on the list is to, you know, take a break from

00:49.700 --> 00:56.380
the gay sex, not inject Botox into your asshole to loosen it up and keep the good times rolling.

00:56.380 --> 01:01.460
How deep is this Botox going legitimately asking as a medical student just in the sphincter

01:01.460 --> 01:06.580
to make it relax. It's generally done if you get a lot of fissures. Oh, it's generally

01:06.580 --> 01:11.180
done like this is some kind of common procedure most normal people get no big deal. Jesus

01:11.180 --> 01:16.060
Christ. I don't like to bottom because of the fissures I get every single time. I know

01:16.060 --> 01:21.300
I get torn up and it's the worst like what the fuck guys do you not use lube? This sounds

01:21.300 --> 01:25.620
like they're fucking animals that have barbed dicks. I'm way too tight to get more than

01:25.620 --> 01:30.740
a finger up there. Then why are you doing it? Jesus forget about that that degeneracy

01:30.740 --> 01:34.540
gay sex is icky angle that I'm sure a lot of my audience is currently feeling right

01:34.540 --> 01:38.580
now. There's also a practical conversation here. There's ways to loosen up before you

01:38.580 --> 01:43.420
get into taking cocks in the ass man. You don't need to fly hole first onto the thickest

01:43.420 --> 01:49.040
shaft in the room. And just in case you think this is about say two loving monogamous gay

01:49.040 --> 01:53.380
men in a closed relationship who are having some sexual problems that require medical

01:53.380 --> 01:57.580
intervention that sometimes happens to straight couples to like the dicks too big or whatever.

01:57.580 --> 02:01.940
Nope. This is just about being a degenerate. It's more about healing things below. I'm

02:01.940 --> 02:06.460
not doing shit for a top. Yep, this guy doesn't give a shit about who he's having sex with,

02:06.460 --> 02:10.900
which might be one of the reasons why he's having this problem. You know, in an age of

02:10.900 --> 02:15.360
monkey pox being spread by promiscuous gay sex, and the data is finally conclusively

02:15.360 --> 02:19.680
in on that one, by the way, guys, it's not that incidental contact with sweat or pus

02:19.680 --> 02:23.880
or saliva that happens during sex sometimes that is spreading monkey pox right now. Rather

02:23.880 --> 02:28.900
monkey pox is being spread specifically through semen. You think that the gays would tone

02:28.900 --> 02:34.640
it down, not tear it up. Literally. Alright, let's give this guy the benefit of the doubt.

02:34.640 --> 02:38.640
For those wondering, Botox paralyzes muscles and if used on the sphincter will help it

02:38.640 --> 02:43.720
relax and allow fissures to heal more easily. Also, I get Botox in the top of my head and

02:43.720 --> 02:48.080
neck to help with migraines. It won't make your hole look 10 years younger. I already

02:48.080 --> 02:52.280
passed. If you have a fissure, doctors can give you a compound prescription ointment

02:52.280 --> 02:56.480
that increases blood flow to the area. Do not use hemorrhoid cream. It does the opposite.

02:56.480 --> 03:00.000
Jesus, imagine that conversation with your doctor. Yes, sir. I love getting ass fucked

03:00.000 --> 03:04.160
so much. You got to prescribe me some anal cream. But Botox can help relax the sphincter

03:04.160 --> 03:08.340
speeding up healing. If it causes incontinence, you will tighten up in two to three months.

03:08.340 --> 03:13.680
So yeah, literally choosing to shit yourself in order to have sex. I appreciate the discourse

03:13.680 --> 03:17.740
and how vulnerable people have been sharing their struggles with bottoming, fissures and

03:17.740 --> 03:22.720
IBS. The ridicule and vitriol I've received exemplifies the stigma around this. Do not

03:22.720 --> 03:28.560
be ashamed. You are not alone. Thank you for the overwhelming love and support. Dude. Okay,

03:28.560 --> 03:33.000
let's put the promiscuity thing aside for a minute. If I personally ever had any sort

03:33.000 --> 03:36.880
of medical problem like this, none of you would ever know about it because I know what's

03:36.880 --> 03:41.120
appropriate to post on social media and what's appropriate to keep within my private life.

03:41.120 --> 03:45.600
It is proper that there is a barrier between your public and personal spheres. Not everybody

03:45.600 --> 03:49.720
needs to know everything you've ever done. In other words, TMI buddy. Moreover, the reason

03:49.720 --> 03:54.080
you're getting ridiculed is because what you are saying is ridiculous. Like I'm kind of

03:54.080 --> 03:57.660
a comedian, right? Not a very good one, I guess, but I don't mind doing goofier videos

03:57.660 --> 04:02.000
sometimes or telling jokes or making a fool out of myself on stream. I do that sort of

04:02.000 --> 04:06.120
thing more on the gaming channel than here, but I'm still not purely serious 100% of the

04:06.120 --> 04:09.720
time. I know my job. I'm fundamentally an entertainer and my content has to be either

04:09.720 --> 04:14.040
interesting or funny to get you to watch it. I can absolutely picture a series of jokes

04:14.040 --> 04:18.060
on stream where I talk about injecting my asshole with Botox in order to increase the

04:18.060 --> 04:22.040
amount of anal sex I can have and exactly how fast the chat room would be scrolling

04:22.040 --> 04:26.100
in response. They would be laughing at me and that's the point. The joke is that I would

04:26.100 --> 04:30.660
sound ridiculous, but I'd be doing it as a joke. You're actually out here saying this

04:30.660 --> 04:35.400
shit seriously. How could you be anything other than a laughing stock, dude? Here's

04:35.400 --> 04:39.680
the worst part about this whole topic. This actually isn't the first time that Botoxing

04:39.680 --> 04:45.320
your butthole has gone viral. Nope, the internet's seen this one before. Vice.com, March 29th,

04:45.320 --> 04:51.040
2017. Anal rejuvenation is making works of art out of American butts. From skin tag removal

04:51.040 --> 04:56.080
to tightening procedures to anal Botox, how a new class of doctors is making bottoming

04:56.080 --> 05:00.600
its top priority. Alright, I'm a fascist now. You won me over. I just wanted to play fucking

05:00.600 --> 05:06.000
video games. In 2010, Tom went to see a surgeon about getting skin tags removed around his

05:06.000 --> 05:10.060
anus. As a sexually active gay man, this wasn't just a routine cleanup, more like

05:10.060 --> 05:17.060
a fresh coat of paint on a bed and breakfast with frequent visitors. Ultimately, the surgeon

05:17.060 --> 05:22.720
he saw not only removed them, but took internal hemorrhoids and anal dysplasia or precancerous

05:22.720 --> 05:27.240
cells along with them. Jesus Christ. I don't know if it works like this, but when you have

05:27.240 --> 05:31.460
so much anal sex, you start to get cancer. But Tom said the surgeon was more aggressive

05:31.460 --> 05:35.560
than he needed to be and didn't consider that his butthole was also a sexual organ.

05:36.120 --> 05:39.640
It was horrific, the 48-year-old said. I was on the sofa for three months in horrible pain.

05:39.640 --> 05:43.600
It was six years ago, and I still can't have anal sex comfortably, which has destroyed

05:43.600 --> 05:48.280
50% of my sexuality. I can't explain the emotional toil it took on me. About a year ago, Tom

05:48.280 --> 05:53.960
found Dr. Evan Goldstein, the founder of Bespoke Surgical and a leading practitioner in the

05:53.960 --> 05:59.400
burgeoning field of anal rejuvenation. I told him, look, if I can't get fucked, at least

05:59.400 --> 06:03.760
make my butthole look pretty. And he did. Goldstein said his private practice really

06:03.760 --> 06:08.840
started booming about five years ago when patients started asking for more lickable,

06:08.840 --> 06:19.320
playable holes. And just in case you're curious, people are dropping up to $25,000 a shot on

06:19.320 --> 06:24.240
Dr. Goldstein's anal botox. That's a lot of money you could have saved by not fucking

06:24.240 --> 06:28.080
yourself into physical ruin. I feel the same way with women who get plastic

06:28.080 --> 06:31.400
surgery in their vaginas. Like, chill the fuck out with that. Unless you've got Cthulhu

06:31.400 --> 06:35.000
down there, I don't think anybody actually cares. But for some reason, getting vaginal

06:35.000 --> 06:39.080
re-sculpting and reshaping and whatever the fuck, that seems to be on the rise too, and

06:39.080 --> 06:42.760
that's just as ridiculous. Unrelated to either the 2017 Vice article

06:42.760 --> 06:48.580
or the recent viral tweet by, uh, Sloppy Scorpio, is this article on TheBody.com, which bills

06:48.580 --> 06:54.140
itself as the internet's HIV slash AIDS resource. Now, I've been told many times over the years

06:54.140 --> 06:58.260
that considering AIDS as a gay disease or whatever is bigoted, and fair enough. But

06:58.260 --> 07:02.340
if that's the case, why the hell does an AIDS resource site have so many articles that

07:02.340 --> 07:06.440
focus on gay sex? Anyway, the article is titled, Is Anal Botox

07:06.440 --> 07:10.620
a Miracle for Painful Bottoming? And I'm just here thinking, dude, if you've got AIDS, maybe

07:10.620 --> 07:13.780
you just fucked it up a bit too much. Maybe your sex life should just be over at that

07:13.780 --> 07:17.560
point. But finally, after many wasted hours trying

07:17.560 --> 07:21.960
to get to the bottom of this story for this video, we can finally drill down to some core

07:21.960 --> 07:26.860
nugget of truth. Specifically in the preamble of this article before the anal botox bit.

07:26.860 --> 07:32.000
I got my first botox injections two months ago. As an expressive 32-year-old gay man,

07:32.000 --> 07:36.200
I've been flirting with the idea of preventative facial botox for a few years now, crossing

07:36.200 --> 07:40.360
the threshold of 30 years old, had ignited a deep existential dread, and I decided to

07:40.360 --> 07:44.440
pull the trigger after a friend told me he could get me a lofty discount. Needless to

07:44.440 --> 07:48.080
say, I'm thrilled with the results, though you could never tell because my face is frozen

07:48.080 --> 07:50.280
and I plan to keep it that way. Thank you very much.

07:50.280 --> 07:54.400
The author of this article, Bobby Box, is certainly a handsome man who appears to be

07:54.400 --> 07:58.260
doing well for himself, at least based off his TikTok account. Same with that sloppy

07:58.260 --> 08:01.660
Scorpio dude at the beginning of the video. Same with a lot of the guys featured in my

08:01.660 --> 08:06.560
previous monkey pox video. But they all have the same basic attitude. You can smell the

08:06.560 --> 08:11.680
extreme fear of getting older, wafting off of them. This existential dread, as Box says

08:11.680 --> 08:16.500
in the article. I've seen many porn stars, OnlyFans women, and prostitutes all say the

08:16.500 --> 08:21.380
same thing on the female side of the conversation. They all inevitably ask, though very rarely

08:21.380 --> 08:25.760
publicly. When the looks fade, then what? Red Pillars already have a pre-set script

08:25.760 --> 08:29.400
for that conversation with women. The beauty of youth fades, so you need to find a man

08:29.400 --> 08:33.320
who has some value and have children and build a life for yourself. Something that will persist

08:33.320 --> 08:37.120
for the entirety of your life, not just the early years. And fair enough, that's one

08:37.120 --> 08:41.520
very common and very successful way to do it. You don't commonly see men feeling this

08:41.520 --> 08:45.720
way, though. At least not like this. Of course, men feel the ravages of time as well. I'm

08:45.720 --> 08:49.360
sure one day I will be middle-aged, looking in the bathroom mirror, wondering what happened

08:49.360 --> 08:53.060
to the person that I was, pining for those younger years. That happens to all of us,

08:53.060 --> 08:57.060
at least a little bit. But you can save off that existential dread by being a responsible

08:57.060 --> 09:01.260
father and an attentive husband. Or by building a business that others can be lifted out of

09:01.260 --> 09:05.500
poverty and wage slavery into. Or by devoting yourself to a charitable cause and making

09:05.500 --> 09:09.580
your community better. Or by working in your job in an honest manner and applying yourself

09:09.580 --> 09:13.900
diligently and establishing yourself as a person to trust when things go sideways. Or

09:13.900 --> 09:17.740
how about all of these things? At least, as many of them as you can manage. Meaning is

09:17.740 --> 09:22.520
found in voluntarily taking up responsibility, and it's meaning that staves off existential

09:22.520 --> 09:27.320
dread. It will be the meaning of a well-lived life that is your final companion on your

09:27.320 --> 09:32.440
deathbed. If your life is so fucking empty that you need to inject Botox into your face

09:32.440 --> 09:35.920
because you're afraid of getting old, and Botox into your butthole because the only

09:35.920 --> 09:40.660
thing you have to look forward to is meaningless sex, well, that sounds like a terrible life

09:40.660 --> 09:45.000
to me. And if you're the type of weird person who just happens to find that sort of thing

09:45.000 --> 09:48.460
truly fulfilling, then all the power to you. But do you think it's these guys? Do you

09:48.460 --> 09:52.200
think the person who writes about turning 30 and getting Botox to cope with it really

09:52.200 --> 09:56.980
loves his life deep down? Yes, these people are ridiculous and disgusting and hilarious,

09:56.980 --> 10:01.140
but when you peel the layers back, you find that they're also insecure and desperate

10:01.140 --> 10:05.140
and sad. This isn't even a gay thing in the end, it's a nihilism thing. Though there's

10:05.140 --> 10:09.520
clearly a lot of overlap there, the gay men in monogamous responsible relationships with

10:09.520 --> 10:14.300
well-rounded careers and lives likely do not suffer from quite the same existential problems

10:14.300 --> 10:18.120
as these guys. Anyway, I have no idea how to end this video, so don't fucking Botox

10:18.120 --> 10:19.040
your butthole. Bye!
