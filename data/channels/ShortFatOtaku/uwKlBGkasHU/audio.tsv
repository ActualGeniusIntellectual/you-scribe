0	11760	I'm in a real gay man's dilemma. Do I get Botox for my whole to reduce fissures slash
11760	16620	allow me to bottom more but take on the risk of shitting myself in public?
16620	21540	You know, I had some hopes of this being a serious YouTube channel one day. I was talking
21540	25140	about a name change to something that's more suited to my current analytical style.
25140	29420	I did that video examining why leftists tend to hate charity. I've got our video coming
29420	33780	down the pipe describing the three forms of fascism and what lands in my lap today
33780	38660	but Botoxing your butthole. As always, this ain't getting monetized so please toss a few
38660	39660	dollars my way.
39660	44780	I think the first thing that I need to ask is if you're getting fucked so much that you've
44780	49700	got anal fissures, maybe the first thing on the list is to, you know, take a break from
49700	56380	the gay sex, not inject Botox into your asshole to loosen it up and keep the good times rolling.
56380	61460	How deep is this Botox going legitimately asking as a medical student just in the sphincter
61460	66580	to make it relax. It's generally done if you get a lot of fissures. Oh, it's generally
66580	71180	done like this is some kind of common procedure most normal people get no big deal. Jesus
71180	76060	Christ. I don't like to bottom because of the fissures I get every single time. I know
76060	81300	I get torn up and it's the worst like what the fuck guys do you not use lube? This sounds
81300	85620	like they're fucking animals that have barbed dicks. I'm way too tight to get more than
85620	90740	a finger up there. Then why are you doing it? Jesus forget about that that degeneracy
90740	94540	gay sex is icky angle that I'm sure a lot of my audience is currently feeling right
94540	98580	now. There's also a practical conversation here. There's ways to loosen up before you
98580	103420	get into taking cocks in the ass man. You don't need to fly hole first onto the thickest
103420	109040	shaft in the room. And just in case you think this is about say two loving monogamous gay
109040	113380	men in a closed relationship who are having some sexual problems that require medical
113380	117580	intervention that sometimes happens to straight couples to like the dicks too big or whatever.
117580	121940	Nope. This is just about being a degenerate. It's more about healing things below. I'm
121940	126460	not doing shit for a top. Yep, this guy doesn't give a shit about who he's having sex with,
126460	130900	which might be one of the reasons why he's having this problem. You know, in an age of
130900	135360	monkey pox being spread by promiscuous gay sex, and the data is finally conclusively
135360	139680	in on that one, by the way, guys, it's not that incidental contact with sweat or pus
139680	143880	or saliva that happens during sex sometimes that is spreading monkey pox right now. Rather
143880	148900	monkey pox is being spread specifically through semen. You think that the gays would tone
148900	154640	it down, not tear it up. Literally. Alright, let's give this guy the benefit of the doubt.
154640	158640	For those wondering, Botox paralyzes muscles and if used on the sphincter will help it
158640	163720	relax and allow fissures to heal more easily. Also, I get Botox in the top of my head and
163720	168080	neck to help with migraines. It won't make your hole look 10 years younger. I already
168080	172280	passed. If you have a fissure, doctors can give you a compound prescription ointment
172280	176480	that increases blood flow to the area. Do not use hemorrhoid cream. It does the opposite.
176480	180000	Jesus, imagine that conversation with your doctor. Yes, sir. I love getting ass fucked
180000	184160	so much. You got to prescribe me some anal cream. But Botox can help relax the sphincter
184160	188340	speeding up healing. If it causes incontinence, you will tighten up in two to three months.
188340	193680	So yeah, literally choosing to shit yourself in order to have sex. I appreciate the discourse
193680	197740	and how vulnerable people have been sharing their struggles with bottoming, fissures and
197740	202720	IBS. The ridicule and vitriol I've received exemplifies the stigma around this. Do not
202720	208560	be ashamed. You are not alone. Thank you for the overwhelming love and support. Dude. Okay,
208560	213000	let's put the promiscuity thing aside for a minute. If I personally ever had any sort
213000	216880	of medical problem like this, none of you would ever know about it because I know what's
216880	221120	appropriate to post on social media and what's appropriate to keep within my private life.
221120	225600	It is proper that there is a barrier between your public and personal spheres. Not everybody
225600	229720	needs to know everything you've ever done. In other words, TMI buddy. Moreover, the reason
229720	234080	you're getting ridiculed is because what you are saying is ridiculous. Like I'm kind of
234080	237660	a comedian, right? Not a very good one, I guess, but I don't mind doing goofier videos
237660	242000	sometimes or telling jokes or making a fool out of myself on stream. I do that sort of
242000	246120	thing more on the gaming channel than here, but I'm still not purely serious 100% of the
246120	249720	time. I know my job. I'm fundamentally an entertainer and my content has to be either
249720	254040	interesting or funny to get you to watch it. I can absolutely picture a series of jokes
254040	258060	on stream where I talk about injecting my asshole with Botox in order to increase the
258060	262040	amount of anal sex I can have and exactly how fast the chat room would be scrolling
262040	266100	in response. They would be laughing at me and that's the point. The joke is that I would
266100	270660	sound ridiculous, but I'd be doing it as a joke. You're actually out here saying this
270660	275400	shit seriously. How could you be anything other than a laughing stock, dude? Here's
275400	279680	the worst part about this whole topic. This actually isn't the first time that Botoxing
279680	285320	your butthole has gone viral. Nope, the internet's seen this one before. Vice.com, March 29th,
285320	291040	2017. Anal rejuvenation is making works of art out of American butts. From skin tag removal
291040	296080	to tightening procedures to anal Botox, how a new class of doctors is making bottoming
296080	300600	its top priority. Alright, I'm a fascist now. You won me over. I just wanted to play fucking
300600	306000	video games. In 2010, Tom went to see a surgeon about getting skin tags removed around his
306000	310060	anus. As a sexually active gay man, this wasn't just a routine cleanup, more like
310060	317060	a fresh coat of paint on a bed and breakfast with frequent visitors. Ultimately, the surgeon
317060	322720	he saw not only removed them, but took internal hemorrhoids and anal dysplasia or precancerous
322720	327240	cells along with them. Jesus Christ. I don't know if it works like this, but when you have
327240	331460	so much anal sex, you start to get cancer. But Tom said the surgeon was more aggressive
331460	335560	than he needed to be and didn't consider that his butthole was also a sexual organ.
336120	339640	It was horrific, the 48-year-old said. I was on the sofa for three months in horrible pain.
339640	343600	It was six years ago, and I still can't have anal sex comfortably, which has destroyed
343600	348280	50% of my sexuality. I can't explain the emotional toil it took on me. About a year ago, Tom
348280	353960	found Dr. Evan Goldstein, the founder of Bespoke Surgical and a leading practitioner in the
353960	359400	burgeoning field of anal rejuvenation. I told him, look, if I can't get fucked, at least
359400	363760	make my butthole look pretty. And he did. Goldstein said his private practice really
363760	368840	started booming about five years ago when patients started asking for more lickable,
368840	379320	playable holes. And just in case you're curious, people are dropping up to $25,000 a shot on
379320	384240	Dr. Goldstein's anal botox. That's a lot of money you could have saved by not fucking
384240	388080	yourself into physical ruin. I feel the same way with women who get plastic
388080	391400	surgery in their vaginas. Like, chill the fuck out with that. Unless you've got Cthulhu
391400	395000	down there, I don't think anybody actually cares. But for some reason, getting vaginal
395000	399080	re-sculpting and reshaping and whatever the fuck, that seems to be on the rise too, and
399080	402760	that's just as ridiculous. Unrelated to either the 2017 Vice article
402760	408580	or the recent viral tweet by, uh, Sloppy Scorpio, is this article on TheBody.com, which bills
408580	414140	itself as the internet's HIV slash AIDS resource. Now, I've been told many times over the years
414140	418260	that considering AIDS as a gay disease or whatever is bigoted, and fair enough. But
418260	422340	if that's the case, why the hell does an AIDS resource site have so many articles that
422340	426440	focus on gay sex? Anyway, the article is titled, Is Anal Botox
426440	430620	a Miracle for Painful Bottoming? And I'm just here thinking, dude, if you've got AIDS, maybe
430620	433780	you just fucked it up a bit too much. Maybe your sex life should just be over at that
433780	437560	point. But finally, after many wasted hours trying
437560	441960	to get to the bottom of this story for this video, we can finally drill down to some core
441960	446860	nugget of truth. Specifically in the preamble of this article before the anal botox bit.
446860	452000	I got my first botox injections two months ago. As an expressive 32-year-old gay man,
452000	456200	I've been flirting with the idea of preventative facial botox for a few years now, crossing
456200	460360	the threshold of 30 years old, had ignited a deep existential dread, and I decided to
460360	464440	pull the trigger after a friend told me he could get me a lofty discount. Needless to
464440	468080	say, I'm thrilled with the results, though you could never tell because my face is frozen
468080	470280	and I plan to keep it that way. Thank you very much.
470280	474400	The author of this article, Bobby Box, is certainly a handsome man who appears to be
474400	478260	doing well for himself, at least based off his TikTok account. Same with that sloppy
478260	481660	Scorpio dude at the beginning of the video. Same with a lot of the guys featured in my
481660	486560	previous monkey pox video. But they all have the same basic attitude. You can smell the
486560	491680	extreme fear of getting older, wafting off of them. This existential dread, as Box says
491680	496500	in the article. I've seen many porn stars, OnlyFans women, and prostitutes all say the
496500	501380	same thing on the female side of the conversation. They all inevitably ask, though very rarely
501380	505760	publicly. When the looks fade, then what? Red Pillars already have a pre-set script
505760	509400	for that conversation with women. The beauty of youth fades, so you need to find a man
509400	513320	who has some value and have children and build a life for yourself. Something that will persist
513320	517120	for the entirety of your life, not just the early years. And fair enough, that's one
517120	521520	very common and very successful way to do it. You don't commonly see men feeling this
521520	525720	way, though. At least not like this. Of course, men feel the ravages of time as well. I'm
525720	529360	sure one day I will be middle-aged, looking in the bathroom mirror, wondering what happened
529360	533060	to the person that I was, pining for those younger years. That happens to all of us,
533060	537060	at least a little bit. But you can save off that existential dread by being a responsible
537060	541260	father and an attentive husband. Or by building a business that others can be lifted out of
541260	545500	poverty and wage slavery into. Or by devoting yourself to a charitable cause and making
545500	549580	your community better. Or by working in your job in an honest manner and applying yourself
549580	553900	diligently and establishing yourself as a person to trust when things go sideways. Or
553900	557740	how about all of these things? At least, as many of them as you can manage. Meaning is
557740	562520	found in voluntarily taking up responsibility, and it's meaning that staves off existential
562520	567320	dread. It will be the meaning of a well-lived life that is your final companion on your
567320	572440	deathbed. If your life is so fucking empty that you need to inject Botox into your face
572440	575920	because you're afraid of getting old, and Botox into your butthole because the only
575920	580660	thing you have to look forward to is meaningless sex, well, that sounds like a terrible life
580660	585000	to me. And if you're the type of weird person who just happens to find that sort of thing
585000	588460	truly fulfilling, then all the power to you. But do you think it's these guys? Do you
588460	592200	think the person who writes about turning 30 and getting Botox to cope with it really
592200	596980	loves his life deep down? Yes, these people are ridiculous and disgusting and hilarious,
596980	601140	but when you peel the layers back, you find that they're also insecure and desperate
601140	605140	and sad. This isn't even a gay thing in the end, it's a nihilism thing. Though there's
605140	609520	clearly a lot of overlap there, the gay men in monogamous responsible relationships with
609520	614300	well-rounded careers and lives likely do not suffer from quite the same existential problems
614300	618120	as these guys. Anyway, I have no idea how to end this video, so don't fucking Botox
618120	619040	your butthole. Bye!
