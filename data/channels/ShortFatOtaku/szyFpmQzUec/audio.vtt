00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
This doozy of a tweet has been making the rounds recently.

00:02.720 --> 00:06.960
We are in a war between those who choose to be human and those who choose to be white.

00:06.960 --> 00:12.000
In order to effectively stamp out fascism, we must take on all hierarchies at once.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.400
White supremacy cannot be disentangled from patriarchy and class oppression.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.160
Liberalism is not the answer.

00:18.160 --> 00:22.080
To this person, liberalism is not the answer, because liberalism,

00:22.080 --> 00:27.520
unlike Marxism and postmodernism, recognizes hierarchies as necessary for human life.

00:27.520 --> 00:30.880
Without a hierarchy, you can't determine what is more or less valuable.

00:30.880 --> 00:34.080
And without determining value, you can't set any goals for your life.

00:34.080 --> 00:38.480
Basically, if you can't rank order potential futures from most to least desirable,

00:38.480 --> 00:42.560
and that's what a hierarchy is, why even bother with the whole living thing at all?

00:42.560 --> 00:46.080
A common criticism of hierarchies is that they're oppressive. Fair enough.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.040
But hierarchies are oppressive because at the top of the hierarchy

00:49.040 --> 00:51.840
sits an ideal state for operating within that hierarchy.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.920
And if you're not at the top, then you're not the ideal.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.760
And if you're not the ideal, then the presence of the ideal is always going to be oppressive.

00:57.760 --> 01:00.480
You feel judged for not being all that you could be.

01:00.480 --> 01:04.720
The Marxist solution to that is to destroy the hierarchy and the ideal along with it,

01:04.720 --> 01:06.240
so that you're no longer oppressed.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.160
But then you also have nothing to strive towards.

01:08.160 --> 01:11.040
This is why liberalism is not the answer for these people.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.640
The liberal represents the middle ground.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.000
And when viewing the middle ground through an all-or-nothing framework,

01:16.000 --> 01:19.520
every shade of grey is mashed mindlessly into the black,

01:19.520 --> 01:22.240
contrasting with the pure white of social justice.

01:22.240 --> 01:24.320
That's why you get such ridiculous articles,

01:24.320 --> 01:28.160
as centrists are the most hostile to democracy, not extremists.

01:28.160 --> 01:31.280
The author makes the case that centrists damage democracy because,

01:31.280 --> 01:35.360
unlike leftists or rightists, centrists are more skeptical of democracy,

01:35.360 --> 01:38.400
something like 60% in comparison to around 85%.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.120
They're least likely to support free elections of leaders,

01:41.120 --> 01:43.680
just under 50% in comparison to 75%.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.280
And other similar statistics.

01:45.280 --> 01:48.720
However, the article doesn't really get into quantifying the presented data.

01:48.720 --> 01:51.360
Is it because centrists just hate democracy?

01:51.360 --> 01:55.680
Is it because centrists are more likely to be apolitical and simply do not care?

01:55.680 --> 01:59.280
Is it because centrists are more likely to be fed up with the radicals on either side

01:59.280 --> 02:02.320
and support a wiping clean of the slate, as it were?

02:02.320 --> 02:03.040
Who knows?

02:03.040 --> 02:06.960
But the article's title assumes the hate democracy answer right out of the gate.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.440
This is why centrists get demonized, by the way.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.240
A previous video I did on that topic goes more in-depth.

02:12.240 --> 02:17.280
Another great example of this attitude is Hbomberguy's ridiculous tweets on moderation.

02:17.280 --> 02:20.720
Moderation is a delusion people invent to describe themselves.

02:20.720 --> 02:23.600
There is no moderation between right and left,

02:23.600 --> 02:26.960
just like there is no moderation between correct and incorrect.

02:26.960 --> 02:30.240
That's just wrong but pretentious and easily upset about it.

02:30.240 --> 02:35.600
The moderation between drinking poison and not drinking poison is drink a little bit of poison

02:35.600 --> 02:39.920
and then drink a bit more when the purity testing non-drinkers make fun of you.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.160
That's kind of a dumb analogy, isn't it?

02:42.160 --> 02:45.440
First off, it may actually be better to drink a bit of poison each day

02:45.440 --> 02:47.120
so that you don't have to overdose in a month.

02:47.120 --> 02:50.480
But more importantly, look at how he approaches the topic of moderation.

02:50.560 --> 02:54.880
Hbomberguy simply sees left as correct and right as incorrect.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.400
One is good, the other is evil.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.920
That's why there's no reason to be a moderate and no reason to compromise.

02:59.920 --> 03:04.720
If your political opponents actually were objectively evil and had no real virtues,

03:04.720 --> 03:07.200
then why not eternally go to war with them?

03:07.200 --> 03:09.600
And that attitude is the genesis of everything.

03:09.600 --> 03:14.640
Antifa's political violence, the extreme deplatforming of anyone who's not far left,

03:14.640 --> 03:17.520
firing from jobs, closing of accounts, everything.

03:17.520 --> 03:20.000
SJWs don't view this as a political disagreement.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.280
They view their opponents as having no moral value whatsoever.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.480
And to even negotiate with people that have no moral value,

03:26.480 --> 03:29.520
that aren't really people, is itself a crime.

03:29.520 --> 03:32.160
Of course, the left's political opponents are people.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.440
They do have virtues.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.120
They do have moral value.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.040
They do have something to add to the discussion,

03:37.040 --> 03:38.800
something that the left can't bring to the table.

03:38.800 --> 03:43.280
Those facts are what make these positions and actions dehumanizing.

03:43.280 --> 03:44.640
Yeah, dehumanizing.

03:44.640 --> 03:49.520
That thing that the left accuses the right of doing based on race or gender or trans status.

03:49.600 --> 03:54.000
The left does it to the right and the center based on them being not left.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.640
But this video is titled On the Purity Spiral, and we haven't even talked about it yet.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.480
Where does the purity spiral come into this?

04:00.480 --> 04:05.600
Well, the purity spiral is the next logical step after the dehumanization of your enemies.

04:05.600 --> 04:06.880
Consider it like this.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.840
The set that we're talking about is the political spectrum.

04:09.840 --> 04:14.400
Within that set, we have the radical left, the left, the center left,

04:14.400 --> 04:18.720
the centrists, the center right, the right, and the radical right.

04:18.720 --> 04:23.840
Within the set, the radical left decides not just to disagree politically with the radical right

04:23.840 --> 04:26.400
and have those arguments with them in a public sphere,

04:26.400 --> 04:30.400
but instead they decide to blacklist them from humanity itself.

04:30.400 --> 04:35.200
Unperson them, dehumanize them, kick them out of society, remove them from the set.

04:35.200 --> 04:39.840
Well, once you've decided that a group of human beings no longer have the universal human rights

04:39.840 --> 04:44.240
that we've all decided everybody should have, it becomes very easy to justify doing it again.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.920
Next up, it's the right that has to go down the unpersoning hole.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.200
Then it's the center right.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.720
Then it's the centrists.

04:50.720 --> 04:52.560
Then liberals get the bullet too.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.840
Because once you eliminate the most extreme opposite end of the spectrum,

04:55.840 --> 04:59.200
the next most opposing position becomes the new extreme.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.920
This is how shades of gray get mashed into the black.

05:01.920 --> 05:05.360
This is how everyone who's not far left becomes far right.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.680
And when you've safely built your walled garden,

05:07.680 --> 05:12.320
when only your supporters remain in civilized society, what do you do next?

05:12.320 --> 05:15.680
I mean, you're not going to dismantle your dehumanizing infrastructure.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.000
It's become its own bureaucracy at this point.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.240
It needs to justify its continued existence.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.960
Gender studies professors didn't step down from their posts

05:22.960 --> 05:26.320
and close their departments once women achieved legal equality after all.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.280
No, next up you get nonsense like colorism.

05:29.280 --> 05:34.720
Like Will Smith facing backlash after being cast to play Serena Williams' father Richard

05:34.720 --> 05:35.680
in a new biopic.

05:35.680 --> 05:39.120
Twitter users argue that his skin isn't dark enough for the role.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.000
With white people gone, cast out of polite society,

05:42.000 --> 05:46.960
the new extreme opponent consists of black people who are more pale than other black people.

05:46.960 --> 05:51.120
Will Smith's shade of brown skin might as well just be Caucasian

05:51.120 --> 05:53.040
because he's not black enough, dammit.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.880
And what's at the end of the purity spiral?

05:55.440 --> 05:56.960
Violence and destruction.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.080
Consider this article.

05:58.080 --> 06:01.120
LGBT activist burned down his own home

06:01.120 --> 06:04.240
because he was annoyed there was no prejudice to campaign against.

06:04.240 --> 06:07.440
This person was an activist, but the problem they had seemed to be solved,

06:07.440 --> 06:08.640
at least in their area.

06:08.640 --> 06:11.360
Instead of dismantling the machinery used to solve the problem,

06:11.360 --> 06:15.200
the machinery had to be used on something else to justify its continued existence.

06:15.200 --> 06:19.040
This is the root of people who make false rape claims to start a dialogue.

06:19.040 --> 06:22.080
They need to use falsehoods to create the dialogue they want to hear

06:22.080 --> 06:23.520
because the truth won't do.

06:23.520 --> 06:26.560
The dialogue is more important than the reality they find themselves in.

06:26.560 --> 06:29.440
The machinery becomes more important than the cause it serves.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.400
The purity spiral is the end game of dehumanization.

06:32.400 --> 06:36.160
Any ideology willing to treat any human being as inherently less than

06:36.160 --> 06:37.760
is susceptible to purity spirals,

06:37.760 --> 06:41.520
whether that's social justice, the alt-right, radical Islam, whatever.

06:41.520 --> 06:45.680
Liberalism is the only political position that avoids the problem of the purity spiral,

06:45.680 --> 06:47.280
because unlike its competitors,

06:47.280 --> 06:51.360
liberalism doesn't deal with its opponents' arguments by dehumanizing their speakers.

06:52.560 --> 06:57.200
If you're not with me, then you're my enemy.
