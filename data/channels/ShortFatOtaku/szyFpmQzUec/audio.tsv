0	2720	This doozy of a tweet has been making the rounds recently.
2720	6960	We are in a war between those who choose to be human and those who choose to be white.
6960	12000	In order to effectively stamp out fascism, we must take on all hierarchies at once.
12000	16400	White supremacy cannot be disentangled from patriarchy and class oppression.
16400	18160	Liberalism is not the answer.
18160	22080	To this person, liberalism is not the answer, because liberalism,
22080	27520	unlike Marxism and postmodernism, recognizes hierarchies as necessary for human life.
27520	30880	Without a hierarchy, you can't determine what is more or less valuable.
30880	34080	And without determining value, you can't set any goals for your life.
34080	38480	Basically, if you can't rank order potential futures from most to least desirable,
38480	42560	and that's what a hierarchy is, why even bother with the whole living thing at all?
42560	46080	A common criticism of hierarchies is that they're oppressive. Fair enough.
46080	49040	But hierarchies are oppressive because at the top of the hierarchy
49040	51840	sits an ideal state for operating within that hierarchy.
51840	53920	And if you're not at the top, then you're not the ideal.
54000	57760	And if you're not the ideal, then the presence of the ideal is always going to be oppressive.
57760	60480	You feel judged for not being all that you could be.
60480	64720	The Marxist solution to that is to destroy the hierarchy and the ideal along with it,
64720	66240	so that you're no longer oppressed.
66240	68160	But then you also have nothing to strive towards.
68160	71040	This is why liberalism is not the answer for these people.
71040	72640	The liberal represents the middle ground.
72640	76000	And when viewing the middle ground through an all-or-nothing framework,
76000	79520	every shade of grey is mashed mindlessly into the black,
79520	82240	contrasting with the pure white of social justice.
82240	84320	That's why you get such ridiculous articles,
84320	88160	as centrists are the most hostile to democracy, not extremists.
88160	91280	The author makes the case that centrists damage democracy because,
91280	95360	unlike leftists or rightists, centrists are more skeptical of democracy,
95360	98400	something like 60% in comparison to around 85%.
98400	101120	They're least likely to support free elections of leaders,
101120	103680	just under 50% in comparison to 75%.
103680	105280	And other similar statistics.
105280	108720	However, the article doesn't really get into quantifying the presented data.
108720	111360	Is it because centrists just hate democracy?
111360	115680	Is it because centrists are more likely to be apolitical and simply do not care?
115680	119280	Is it because centrists are more likely to be fed up with the radicals on either side
119280	122320	and support a wiping clean of the slate, as it were?
122320	123040	Who knows?
123040	126960	But the article's title assumes the hate democracy answer right out of the gate.
126960	129440	This is why centrists get demonized, by the way.
129440	132240	A previous video I did on that topic goes more in-depth.
132240	137280	Another great example of this attitude is Hbomberguy's ridiculous tweets on moderation.
137280	140720	Moderation is a delusion people invent to describe themselves.
140720	143600	There is no moderation between right and left,
143600	146960	just like there is no moderation between correct and incorrect.
146960	150240	That's just wrong but pretentious and easily upset about it.
150240	155600	The moderation between drinking poison and not drinking poison is drink a little bit of poison
155600	159920	and then drink a bit more when the purity testing non-drinkers make fun of you.
159920	162160	That's kind of a dumb analogy, isn't it?
162160	165440	First off, it may actually be better to drink a bit of poison each day
165440	167120	so that you don't have to overdose in a month.
167120	170480	But more importantly, look at how he approaches the topic of moderation.
170560	174880	Hbomberguy simply sees left as correct and right as incorrect.
174880	176400	One is good, the other is evil.
176400	179920	That's why there's no reason to be a moderate and no reason to compromise.
179920	184720	If your political opponents actually were objectively evil and had no real virtues,
184720	187200	then why not eternally go to war with them?
187200	189600	And that attitude is the genesis of everything.
189600	194640	Antifa's political violence, the extreme deplatforming of anyone who's not far left,
194640	197520	firing from jobs, closing of accounts, everything.
197520	200000	SJWs don't view this as a political disagreement.
200000	203280	They view their opponents as having no moral value whatsoever.
203280	206480	And to even negotiate with people that have no moral value,
206480	209520	that aren't really people, is itself a crime.
209520	212160	Of course, the left's political opponents are people.
212160	213440	They do have virtues.
213440	215120	They do have moral value.
215120	217040	They do have something to add to the discussion,
217040	218800	something that the left can't bring to the table.
218800	223280	Those facts are what make these positions and actions dehumanizing.
223280	224640	Yeah, dehumanizing.
224640	229520	That thing that the left accuses the right of doing based on race or gender or trans status.
229600	234000	The left does it to the right and the center based on them being not left.
234000	238640	But this video is titled On the Purity Spiral, and we haven't even talked about it yet.
238640	240480	Where does the purity spiral come into this?
240480	245600	Well, the purity spiral is the next logical step after the dehumanization of your enemies.
245600	246880	Consider it like this.
246880	249840	The set that we're talking about is the political spectrum.
249840	254400	Within that set, we have the radical left, the left, the center left,
254400	258720	the centrists, the center right, the right, and the radical right.
258720	263840	Within the set, the radical left decides not just to disagree politically with the radical right
263840	266400	and have those arguments with them in a public sphere,
266400	270400	but instead they decide to blacklist them from humanity itself.
270400	275200	Unperson them, dehumanize them, kick them out of society, remove them from the set.
275200	279840	Well, once you've decided that a group of human beings no longer have the universal human rights
279840	284240	that we've all decided everybody should have, it becomes very easy to justify doing it again.
284800	287920	Next up, it's the right that has to go down the unpersoning hole.
287920	289200	Then it's the center right.
289200	290720	Then it's the centrists.
290720	292560	Then liberals get the bullet too.
292560	295840	Because once you eliminate the most extreme opposite end of the spectrum,
295840	299200	the next most opposing position becomes the new extreme.
299200	301920	This is how shades of gray get mashed into the black.
301920	305360	This is how everyone who's not far left becomes far right.
305360	307680	And when you've safely built your walled garden,
307680	312320	when only your supporters remain in civilized society, what do you do next?
312320	315680	I mean, you're not going to dismantle your dehumanizing infrastructure.
315680	318000	It's become its own bureaucracy at this point.
318000	320240	It needs to justify its continued existence.
320240	322960	Gender studies professors didn't step down from their posts
322960	326320	and close their departments once women achieved legal equality after all.
326320	329280	No, next up you get nonsense like colorism.
329280	334720	Like Will Smith facing backlash after being cast to play Serena Williams' father Richard
334720	335680	in a new biopic.
335680	339120	Twitter users argue that his skin isn't dark enough for the role.
339120	342000	With white people gone, cast out of polite society,
342000	346960	the new extreme opponent consists of black people who are more pale than other black people.
346960	351120	Will Smith's shade of brown skin might as well just be Caucasian
351120	353040	because he's not black enough, dammit.
353040	354880	And what's at the end of the purity spiral?
355440	356960	Violence and destruction.
356960	358080	Consider this article.
358080	361120	LGBT activist burned down his own home
361120	364240	because he was annoyed there was no prejudice to campaign against.
364240	367440	This person was an activist, but the problem they had seemed to be solved,
367440	368640	at least in their area.
368640	371360	Instead of dismantling the machinery used to solve the problem,
371360	375200	the machinery had to be used on something else to justify its continued existence.
375200	379040	This is the root of people who make false rape claims to start a dialogue.
379040	382080	They need to use falsehoods to create the dialogue they want to hear
382080	383520	because the truth won't do.
383520	386560	The dialogue is more important than the reality they find themselves in.
386560	389440	The machinery becomes more important than the cause it serves.
389440	392400	The purity spiral is the end game of dehumanization.
392400	396160	Any ideology willing to treat any human being as inherently less than
396160	397760	is susceptible to purity spirals,
397760	401520	whether that's social justice, the alt-right, radical Islam, whatever.
401520	405680	Liberalism is the only political position that avoids the problem of the purity spiral,
405680	407280	because unlike its competitors,
407280	411360	liberalism doesn't deal with its opponents' arguments by dehumanizing their speakers.
412560	417200	If you're not with me, then you're my enemy.
