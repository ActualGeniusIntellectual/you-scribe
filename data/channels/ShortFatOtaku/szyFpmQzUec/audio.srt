00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
This doozy of a tweet has been making the rounds recently.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,960
We are in a war between those who choose to be human and those who choose to be white.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,000
In order to effectively stamp out fascism, we must take on all hierarchies at once.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,400
White supremacy cannot be disentangled from patriarchy and class oppression.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,160
Liberalism is not the answer.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,080
To this person, liberalism is not the answer, because liberalism,

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,520
unlike Marxism and postmodernism, recognizes hierarchies as necessary for human life.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,880
Without a hierarchy, you can't determine what is more or less valuable.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,080
And without determining value, you can't set any goals for your life.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,480
Basically, if you can't rank order potential futures from most to least desirable,

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,560
and that's what a hierarchy is, why even bother with the whole living thing at all?

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,080
A common criticism of hierarchies is that they're oppressive. Fair enough.

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,040
But hierarchies are oppressive because at the top of the hierarchy

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,840
sits an ideal state for operating within that hierarchy.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,920
And if you're not at the top, then you're not the ideal.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,760
And if you're not the ideal, then the presence of the ideal is always going to be oppressive.

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,480
You feel judged for not being all that you could be.

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,720
The Marxist solution to that is to destroy the hierarchy and the ideal along with it,

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,240
so that you're no longer oppressed.

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,160
But then you also have nothing to strive towards.

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,040
This is why liberalism is not the answer for these people.

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,640
The liberal represents the middle ground.

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,000
And when viewing the middle ground through an all-or-nothing framework,

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,520
every shade of grey is mashed mindlessly into the black,

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,240
contrasting with the pure white of social justice.

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,320
That's why you get such ridiculous articles,

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,160
as centrists are the most hostile to democracy, not extremists.

28
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,280
The author makes the case that centrists damage democracy because,

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,360
unlike leftists or rightists, centrists are more skeptical of democracy,

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,400
something like 60% in comparison to around 85%.

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,120
They're least likely to support free elections of leaders,

32
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,680
just under 50% in comparison to 75%.

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,280
And other similar statistics.

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,720
However, the article doesn't really get into quantifying the presented data.

35
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,360
Is it because centrists just hate democracy?

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,680
Is it because centrists are more likely to be apolitical and simply do not care?

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,280
Is it because centrists are more likely to be fed up with the radicals on either side

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,320
and support a wiping clean of the slate, as it were?

39
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,040
Who knows?

40
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,960
But the article's title assumes the hate democracy answer right out of the gate.

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,440
This is why centrists get demonized, by the way.

42
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,240
A previous video I did on that topic goes more in-depth.

43
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,280
Another great example of this attitude is Hbomberguy's ridiculous tweets on moderation.

44
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,720
Moderation is a delusion people invent to describe themselves.

45
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,600
There is no moderation between right and left,

46
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,960
just like there is no moderation between correct and incorrect.

47
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,240
That's just wrong but pretentious and easily upset about it.

48
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,600
The moderation between drinking poison and not drinking poison is drink a little bit of poison

49
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,920
and then drink a bit more when the purity testing non-drinkers make fun of you.

50
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,160
That's kind of a dumb analogy, isn't it?

51
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,440
First off, it may actually be better to drink a bit of poison each day

52
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,120
so that you don't have to overdose in a month.

53
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,480
But more importantly, look at how he approaches the topic of moderation.

54
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,880
Hbomberguy simply sees left as correct and right as incorrect.

55
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,400
One is good, the other is evil.

56
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,920
That's why there's no reason to be a moderate and no reason to compromise.

57
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,720
If your political opponents actually were objectively evil and had no real virtues,

58
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,200
then why not eternally go to war with them?

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,600
And that attitude is the genesis of everything.

60
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,640
Antifa's political violence, the extreme deplatforming of anyone who's not far left,

61
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,520
firing from jobs, closing of accounts, everything.

62
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,000
SJWs don't view this as a political disagreement.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,280
They view their opponents as having no moral value whatsoever.

64
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,480
And to even negotiate with people that have no moral value,

65
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,520
that aren't really people, is itself a crime.

66
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,160
Of course, the left's political opponents are people.

67
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,440
They do have virtues.

68
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,120
They do have moral value.

69
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,040
They do have something to add to the discussion,

70
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,800
something that the left can't bring to the table.

71
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,280
Those facts are what make these positions and actions dehumanizing.

72
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,640
Yeah, dehumanizing.

73
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,520
That thing that the left accuses the right of doing based on race or gender or trans status.

74
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,000
The left does it to the right and the center based on them being not left.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,640
But this video is titled On the Purity Spiral, and we haven't even talked about it yet.

76
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,480
Where does the purity spiral come into this?

77
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,600
Well, the purity spiral is the next logical step after the dehumanization of your enemies.

78
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,880
Consider it like this.

79
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,840
The set that we're talking about is the political spectrum.

80
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,400
Within that set, we have the radical left, the left, the center left,

81
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,720
the centrists, the center right, the right, and the radical right.

82
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,840
Within the set, the radical left decides not just to disagree politically with the radical right

83
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,400
and have those arguments with them in a public sphere,

84
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
but instead they decide to blacklist them from humanity itself.

85
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,200
Unperson them, dehumanize them, kick them out of society, remove them from the set.

86
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,840
Well, once you've decided that a group of human beings no longer have the universal human rights

87
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,240
that we've all decided everybody should have, it becomes very easy to justify doing it again.

88
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,920
Next up, it's the right that has to go down the unpersoning hole.

89
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,200
Then it's the center right.

90
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,720
Then it's the centrists.

91
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,560
Then liberals get the bullet too.

92
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,840
Because once you eliminate the most extreme opposite end of the spectrum,

93
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,200
the next most opposing position becomes the new extreme.

94
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,920
This is how shades of gray get mashed into the black.

95
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,360
This is how everyone who's not far left becomes far right.

96
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,680
And when you've safely built your walled garden,

97
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,320
when only your supporters remain in civilized society, what do you do next?

98
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,680
I mean, you're not going to dismantle your dehumanizing infrastructure.

99
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,000
It's become its own bureaucracy at this point.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,240
It needs to justify its continued existence.

101
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,960
Gender studies professors didn't step down from their posts

102
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,320
and close their departments once women achieved legal equality after all.

103
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,280
No, next up you get nonsense like colorism.

104
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,720
Like Will Smith facing backlash after being cast to play Serena Williams' father Richard

105
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,680
in a new biopic.

106
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,120
Twitter users argue that his skin isn't dark enough for the role.

107
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,000
With white people gone, cast out of polite society,

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,960
the new extreme opponent consists of black people who are more pale than other black people.

109
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,120
Will Smith's shade of brown skin might as well just be Caucasian

110
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,040
because he's not black enough, dammit.

111
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,880
And what's at the end of the purity spiral?

112
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,960
Violence and destruction.

113
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,080
Consider this article.

114
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,120
LGBT activist burned down his own home

115
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,240
because he was annoyed there was no prejudice to campaign against.

116
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,440
This person was an activist, but the problem they had seemed to be solved,

117
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,640
at least in their area.

118
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,360
Instead of dismantling the machinery used to solve the problem,

119
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,200
the machinery had to be used on something else to justify its continued existence.

120
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,040
This is the root of people who make false rape claims to start a dialogue.

121
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,080
They need to use falsehoods to create the dialogue they want to hear

122
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,520
because the truth won't do.

123
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,560
The dialogue is more important than the reality they find themselves in.

124
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,440
The machinery becomes more important than the cause it serves.

125
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,400
The purity spiral is the end game of dehumanization.

126
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,160
Any ideology willing to treat any human being as inherently less than

127
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,760
is susceptible to purity spirals,

128
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,520
whether that's social justice, the alt-right, radical Islam, whatever.

129
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,680
Liberalism is the only political position that avoids the problem of the purity spiral,

130
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,280
because unlike its competitors,

131
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,360
liberalism doesn't deal with its opponents' arguments by dehumanizing their speakers.

132
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,200
If you're not with me, then you're my enemy.
