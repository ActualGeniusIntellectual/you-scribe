1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
So I think it's quite important that this video of Tommy Robinson's be mirrored and spread as far

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,680
and as wide as possible. I did think it was strange that Tommy's been silent for the past

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,200
month or two, and it is good to see him back, but what he's doing now seems to be very important,

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:23,520
so let's take a look. I'm pretty sure there'll be a few executive producers

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:31,440
and journalists from a certain TV programme who are watching this live.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,480
Oh look at the smile on my face! Look at the smile on my face man!

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:56,400
So in the last few months, I found out that panorama, as anyone who's watched my live streams

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:04,400
has seen me say, I know something's coming. A hatchet job of all time is coming. And I say that

9
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:11,920
in the sense that prison didn't work. In fact, it had the opposite effect. In the last matter of

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,040
months, my PayPal, my website, my monthly subscriptions, all of these things have come

11
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,320
under attack. They've all been deleted. One final attempt by the establishment, which would be to

12
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:37,040
destroy me in the nation's eyes. Now, I've become aware that panorama, working alongside

13
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:46,320
a government-supported agency, were planning what was the working title,

14
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Tommy Takedown. This documentary's working title, by the people involved, was called

15
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:04,560
the Tommy Robinson Takedown. What you're going to witness is the most sensational

16
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,480
expose of the BBC this country's ever seen.

17
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,040
How do I release this? Basically,

18
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,000
we went undercover on panorama.

19
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,040
And what did we find? What video evidence have we got?

20
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:41,680
What video evidence could we possibly have? Could we possibly prove corruption? Could we prove the

21
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:49,840
doctrine of videos? Could we prove that we're not going to be able to prove that we're not going to

22
00:02:49,840 --> 00:03:01,920
prove the doctrine of videos? Could we prove fake news, the creation of fake news, in order to

23
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:10,880
destroy who I am and my name? Have we got that on video? Are you sitting there now because you know

24
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,600
what we've got? Because you know you are going, when I put this documentary together, do I just

25
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:27,600
release this documentary? Do I just put it on YouTube? The BBC, it's a stealth tax against us.

26
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:35,440
They make us pay them, whilst they use propaganda to destroy us, to slander us.

27
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:46,000
The panorama, I'd say, expect in the coming days to see resignations.

28
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,920
We are going to expose them to the world. You're all going to see just how corrupt our media is.

29
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,360
All the things you thought, all the accusations against the BBC by Donald Trump as BBC fake news.

30
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm going to prove it. Do you know how worried I've been? Do you know the nights I've had

31
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,640
as soon as I found out what they're doing and the lengths they're going to, to ruin my name?

32
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,800
And all of it has spectacularly

33
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,160
three-sixtied on them and you're all going to witness it.

34
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,760
Now my only question, which I'm still thinking about right now,

35
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,920
is where do we premiere this documentary?

36
00:04:49,920 --> 00:05:00,720
Outside the BBC's head office on a 30-foot screen on Saturday the 23rd of February?

37
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,280
In London or in Manchester? Outside BBC's offices in Manchester?

38
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,240
That's the only decision, that's the only decision I've got to make right now,

39
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,160
is where I'm going to expose BBC hope not hate

40
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,000
all of you. There is an emergency meeting going on right now.

41
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,880
Panorama's executives are sitting around the table panicking because I just showed them in

42
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,400
a spectacular fashion. Wait until you see the footage. I just showed them evidence

43
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,520
of their lead investigative journalist.

44
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:59,600
All the things they say about me, we gathered in evidence against them.

45
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:08,560
So the decision I've got to make, 20,000 people watching this live, give it a share.

46
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:14,080
I am going to prove with undercover surveillance, undercover footage,

47
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:24,720
undercover recordings of the creation of fake news against me. I'm going to prove it.

48
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:35,760
I'm going to prove the bigotry, the classism and the elitism of those working in the BBC.

49
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:46,000
The view, they have a view, the working class. I'm proving it. I've got it in multiple locations,

50
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,640
in multiple countries. There's nothing anyone can do. Now I suspect in the coming days I'm

51
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:58,880
going to face a huge, I don't really know if they can try and defend this, if they can try and stop

52
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,560
it. They might throw lawyers at it to try and get an injunction to prevent me airing it. It's already

53
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:12,720
in other countries. It's going to be aired. Now what I'd ask all of you is where should we air it?

54
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,160
Where should we bring down panorama? Where should we expose hope and not hate?

55
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,680
Where do you want to do it? Outside their offices in London or outside their offices in Manchester?

56
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,920
I personally, my opinion is swaying, I know London is the capital, it's always biggest news

57
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,520
in the capital, but my opinion is swaying towards Manchester simply as a thank you to all the

58
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,280
northerners and the people in Scotland who travel from far for the demonstrations to free me

59
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,080
three or four times. The Brexit rally, London, the day for freedom, London. I'm swaying towards

60
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,120
trying to bring this to the north of England on Saturday the 23rd of February.

61
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,360
And I want you all to join me. So follow, keep following, you're going to see developments.

62
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,360
I'm sure in the coming days I can actually relax because I haven't relaxed for the last,

63
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,960
everyone would have noticed how quiet I've been. I haven't been able to do anything. I've had my

64
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,120
own problems at home. I haven't been able to, I've had my own problems with everything but I haven't

65
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,920
been able to concentrate because I've had this going on in the background and I've been planning

66
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:30,240
this and I put the final nail in the coffin this afternoon and I'll share it all with you.

67
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:37,760
But I just think it's a waste to just release it. I think why don't we have a day out where we

68
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:47,680
absolutely show up and let everyone know that we have evidence of what the BBC do.

69
00:08:47,680 --> 00:09:00,240
But make sure you're available, Saturday the 23rd. I'm now going to start looking at

70
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,560
the costs to get a massive screen, a massive PA system. Journalists and friends from afar,

71
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:19,440
from Australia, Avi, Yemeni, get your flight booked son, to America, to Canada, Ezra, please

72
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:29,680
make plans. We need the world to watch and see and I'm happy. I don't want to seem like I'm gloating

73
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,840
but I've been terrified. I've been absolutely terrified of what they're trying to do to me

74
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:41,280
and the effect it would have on my family and my life and I hope today, today when I put the

75
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:50,000
final nail in the coffin when I met with Panorama, a courier was en route to their offices to deliver

76
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:00,800
legal documents to prevent them lying to the country, fabricating stories to the country,

77
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:09,360
blackmailing people to give negative and false information on me to the country.

78
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:20,160
Anyway, I'm gonna go and enjoy my favourite meal in my favourite restaurant and

79
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,740
and

80
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,560
to those in, to those in Panorama, the worry you have right now

81
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:39,200
is the worry I've had for six to eight weeks, you wankers. You absolute, you,

82
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,560
you're a disgrace to journalism and you're getting exposed.

83
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,520
That's it.

84
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,960
19,500 people watching this live, share it, share it fast, share it wide, start making your plans

85
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:02,400
on February 23rd. I'm actually, it's half term on Monday, I'm away with the kids, so

86
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,680
gonna need some help organizing this demo guys. Well there you have it. Make sure that this video,

87
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,240
not necessarily my copy, just any copy of it goes far and wide. I don't know what you're going to

88
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,880
any copy of it goes far and wide. I do think something big is going to be going down soon

89
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,440
and I am more than happy to use my relatively tiny platform to mirror this and try to get it

90
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,440
out there. I was going to put out a video on the whole KickVic thing in the anime localization

91
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,520
industry but I figured I'll just, I'll wait on that one. I'll give it another few weeks,

92
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,400
collect some more info because all the information doesn't seem to be out yet so I'm gonna hold off.

93
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,120
So this mirroring isn't a complete cop-out for my channel. I have been working on some things,

94
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,760
it's only a partial cop-out. Alright my friends, remember to support Tommy Robinson.

95
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,200
Let's keep our fingers crossed. Two weeks time, February 23rd and whatever it is,

96
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,040
I hope it's fucking incredible. Alright, I love you.
