1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
It's time for a round of Guess That Tweet!

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,840
Who tweeted this out?

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,440
By failing to separate the anonymous, cowardly troll demons from real people in the comments

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,260
section, YouTube and other social media platforms are enabling sadistic, Machiavellian psychopaths

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,480
and narcissists.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,920
Was it A. Anita Sarkeesian, B. Andrew Torba, C. Any of the BreadTubers, or D. Jordan Peterson?

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,160
Well you saw the title of the video, you already know it's Jordan Peterson.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,280
Peterson's going viral right now for arguing against anonymity online, and he's getting

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,340
a lot of pushback from the right who have overwhelmingly taken up the cause of free

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,560
speech in the past decade after the left discarded it.

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,560
What's funny is, the tweet does actually sound like something those other people would

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,560
say.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,200
Anita Sarkeesian is a notorious Gamergate-era censor who wanted sexual and violent content

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,760
stricken out of video games, judging of course from a left-wing perspective, making her a

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,640
mirror image of the previous big gaming censorship baddie, Jack Thompson, on the right.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,120
Andrew Torba started Gab in 2016, the alt-tech twitter, and marketed it as a free speech

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
zone.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,020
But as time went on and he radicalized, he began to ban more and more types of speech,

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:15,080
first beginning with porn in 2019 and then branching out.

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,120
BreadTubers are just well-known for free speech that helps them out and censors their enemies.

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,860
They're just partisans who have no principles beyond what's good for them.

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
But Jordan Peterson?

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,140
Why is he taking an anti-Anon stance?

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,340
Peterson's initial boost into the spotlight was specifically over free speech issues,

25
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,300
compelled speech in Canada, more specifically.

26
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,280
This event happened in the wider context of the left abandoning free speech as a virtue

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,960
back in the early to mid-2010s.

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,020
As I've said many times before, I was a young lefty, and the left, when I was a part

29
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,580
of it, was heavily invested in free speech as a core right.

30
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,940
The right-wing of the time were the older boomer Christian censors, wanting speech banned

31
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,940
in the name of their religion.

32
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,780
And it was the left-wing who said, no, the First Amendment means everyone can speak,

33
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,600
even if it's speech you don't like, even if it's speech you find offensive.

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,700
But then came the political realignment.

35
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,080
As the left gained more and more institutional power, they dropped free speech as a virtue.

36
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,540
It was no longer useful to them.

37
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,740
Its purpose was to have free speech, use it to subvert institutions and take control,

38
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,520
and then ban free speech to protect their new order.

39
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,100
And Jordan Peterson is one of the many people who were caught unaware of that shift and

40
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,100
slammed into a wall because of it.

41
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,100
In fact, that was one of the reasons the pro-Gamergate people felt so betrayed during

42
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,060
that 2014 culture war.

43
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,660
The wider culture had demonized gamers for decades, using the same arguments that they

44
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,840
used on Rock and Roll and D&D.

45
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,580
Gamers expected their enthusiast press to stand up for them, as they had during previous

46
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,580
moral panics.

47
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,540
But now that it was the ethics of that enthusiast press themselves that was being called into

48
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,600
question, they turned on their own audiences.

49
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,180
Good faith questions from the gamers were replied to with accusations of sexism and

50
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,340
racism on the side of the journos, something that Anita Sarkeesian was a small part of.

51
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,340
Yeah, only a small part.

52
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,420
I know the narrative nowadays that she was the centerpiece, but really, having been a

53
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,060
part of it myself, Anita inserted herself for clout.

54
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,480
Nobody actually cared about her.

55
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,060
But the reason I'm going on this side tangent is because a lot of the time, when a free

56
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,180
speech advocate runs into speech they explicitly do not like, or sometimes, just after they've

57
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,040
gained power, suddenly, censorship seems like a good idea.

58
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,420
From hate speech is not free speech morons on the left to what offends me doesn't count

59
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,380
as free speech morons on the right, everyone is carving out their own little exceptions

60
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,380
to these rules.

61
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,300
Hell, some Muslims believe that the old blasphemy laws need to come back, at least for their

62
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,300
god.

63
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,300
Anyone else's existence.

64
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,180
And that's exactly what mockery is.

65
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,620
What the French have done, for example, has actually disrespected our beliefs and our

66
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,800
existence and therefore I don't think it can even be categorized as free speech.

67
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,820
Free speech can only be free speech as long as it respects other people.

68
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:43,980
If anyone is doing a mockery of a religion, of a prophet, do they deserve to pay the ultimate

69
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,980
price?

70
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,180
Do they deserve to die because of that?

71
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,660
That is a great question and that actually brings up another concept of death penalty

72
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,340
and I think that's a completely different question right now that you're asking, but

73
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,900
at the moment I think that we should focus on identifying as what they did was wrong

74
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,380
because a lot of people are saying, oh, you know, it's free speech, it's not mockery.

75
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,200
I think right now what we need to do is get to the root of the problem.

76
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,920
Mockery is not free speech.

77
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,080
What would you suggest as an appropriate penalty for the mockery of a religion or a prophet?

78
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,320
I wouldn't like to comment on this at this time.

79
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,600
And yeah, liberal society does this sort of thing too.

80
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,920
We have some concept of slander and defamation.

81
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,500
A narrow concept where it requires proving that the speaker knows what they're saying

82
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,400
is false and is only saying it to damage the target.

83
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,920
But nonetheless, it's still a restriction on speech.

84
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,920
Another restriction we accept are credible threats or credible incitement.

85
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,960
Credible, meaning that the speech will lead to violent action.

86
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,320
Believe it or not, though, one type of restriction that everyone thinks we have, but we actually

87
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,400
don't, is the whole shouting fire in a crowded theater thing that's actually allowed.

88
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,600
The point is, people who are on the margins of society tend to lean on free speech rights

89
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,880
because it benefits them.

90
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,880
Free speech is what allows them to spread the word of their unorthodox views.

91
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,560
But once the margin becomes the new core, or maybe not even that far, just gain some

92
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,440
position of stability or influence, suddenly free speech no longer benefits them, but it

93
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,440
hurts them.

94
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,320
Now the new margin can speak and undermine their new rule.

95
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,960
From a political realist's point of view, calling for free speech when you're losing

96
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,380
and calling for censorship along your rules when you're winning is the path to victory.

97
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,480
So is that what Jordan Peterson's doing?

98
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
I don't know.

99
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,080
But we can look at his previous stances on this topic.

100
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,440
After Peterson received pushback during his compelled speech controversy, there was a

101
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,060
chorus of voices condemning the loss of free speech in academia.

102
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,640
Especially since that's one of the most important places for free speech to be.

103
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,600
Academia is where you're supposed to get challenged, learn new ideas, discover new

104
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,600
things, through open inquiry, and to see a chilling effect hit the university was scary

105
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
indeed.

106
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,800
And that chilling effect began to spread far beyond just Jordan Peterson's own University

107
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
of Toronto.

108
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,560
The case of Lindsay Shepherd should be one that you all know, at least if you've been

109
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,200
watching my channel for the past few years.

110
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,080
Where, back in 2017, in her capacity as a teacher's assistant teaching a class, she

111
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,000
brought up Jordan Peterson in an academic context.

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,640
Shepherd was hauled in front of the head of her academic program, where it was claimed

113
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,400
that LGBTQ students had filed complaints against her for talking about Jordan Peterson in a

114
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,120
politically neutral manner, which had created a toxic climate for the students.

115
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,520
Because, just as you should not talk about, and I quote, Hitler or Milo Yiannopoulos in

116
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,600
a politically neutral way, the same goes for Jordan Peterson.

117
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:17,520
So just to give you some context about Jordan Peterson is, he is a figure that's basically

118
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,120
highly involved with the alt-right.

119
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:30,400
He lectures about basically critiquing feminism, critiquing trans rights, critiquing white

120
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
supremacy.

121
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
I follow him.

122
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Or not critiquing you.

123
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,600
But the thing is, can you shield people from those ideas?

124
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,840
Am I supposed to comfort them and make sure that they are insulated away from this?

125
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,280
Like is that what the point of this is?

126
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,720
Because to me that is so against what a university is about.

127
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,440
I introduced it critically.

128
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,560
Like I said, it was in the spirit of debate.

129
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,160
Okay, in the spirit of the debate is slightly different than being like, okay this is a

130
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,160
problematic idea that we want to unpack.

131
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,520
But that's taking sides.

132
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,040
It's taking sides for me to be like, oh look at this guy, like everything that comes out

133
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,120
of his mouth is BS but we're going to watch anyway.

134
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,400
So I understand the position that you're coming from and your positionality, but the reality

135
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,400
is that it has created a toxic climate for some of the students.

136
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
How many?

137
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
It's great.

138
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Who?

139
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Like how many?

140
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Okay.

141
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
One?

142
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
May I speak?

143
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,600
I have no concept of like how many people complained, like what their complaint was.

144
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,400
You haven't shown me the complaint.

145
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,840
Yes, I understand that this is upsetting, but there's also confidentiality matters.

146
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,480
The number of people is confidential?

147
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Yes.

148
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,160
I don't see what's transphobic about showing a video of Jordan Peterson.

149
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
He's a real person.

150
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,760
He's out there.

151
00:07:51,760 --> 00:08:02,400
He is a real person, but he is a real person who has engaged in targeted behavior or targeting

152
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,080
of trans students.

153
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,680
This is basically like neutrally playing a speech by Hitler or Milo Yiannopoulos from

154
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
gamergate.

155
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,800
Sheppard was threatened with disciplinary action if she didn't comply with the university's

156
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,760
demands, but an investigation later discovered that no complaint had actually been filed

157
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,840
by any student and she had not violated any school policy.

158
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,520
It turns out the entire thing was cooked up by her academic supervisor, Nathan Rambucana,

159
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,960
who had his own leftist political bias.

160
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,560
Lindsay Sheppard's censure is just one example of many.

161
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,120
How many times have people pulled fire alarms or called in bomb threats on speakers that

162
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,280
they didn't politically align with, generally right-leaning speakers and left-leaning protesters?

163
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,160
Again, as somebody who was a lefty before I grew up, that was wild for me to witness.

164
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,320
The left suddenly being against academic freedom.

165
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,800
It's at the point where, for example, UBC gave a questionnaire asking students about

166
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,720
the morality of Jordan Peterson's free speech stance.

167
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,060
And students overwhelmingly didn't trust that the school wouldn't punish them for

168
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,240
saying other than, I disagree.

169
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,600
So Jordan Peterson, until the tweet that we're talking about today, has pretty much universally

170
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,140
come down on the free speech side of things, even as a storm raged around him over his

171
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,540
commitment to that stance.

172
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,200
And he has faced some true ugliness for that commitment.

173
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,320
When he destroyed Kathy Newman in a debate back in 2018, he was considered a misogynist

174
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,440
for not just bending over and letting her have her way with him.

175
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,800
And Newman continued to play the victim card for years afterwards.

176
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,840
Countless no-names have called him an incel, a misogynist, a men's rights activist, a

177
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,200
fascist, a racist, a transphobe, whatever.

178
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,800
They took every single thing the left claims to hate and just tarred and feathered him

179
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,340
with it to see what would stick.

180
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,520
And when they finally found something they could actually hurt him with, namely his wife's

181
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,700
cancer diagnosis, her near-death experience, and his resulting drug addiction, they latched

182
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,620
onto that for all that it was fucking worth.

183
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,040
I am not surprised he came out of that experience a significantly more negative man than he

184
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,040
was before.

185
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,320
It's no secret that I once liked Jordan Peterson quite a lot.

186
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,220
His psychology takes are still top tier.

187
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,400
And most of what he says otherwise is useful, if a bit generic, self-help stuff.

188
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,840
But it's after the Elliot Page thing a few months back that I feel like he really began

189
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
to lose the plot.

190
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,600
I still listen to his old speeches occasionally too, they're quite good.

191
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,520
But he seems a lot more cynical now, a lot more cold to the world.

192
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,720
Which brings us back to his original tweet, his sudden reversal on free speech.

193
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
Only not exactly.

194
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,360
He's talking about being anonymous here, not free speech.

195
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,960
In 2021, I did a 30 minute video detailing the link between those two concepts.

196
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,500
I don't want to go over it entirely again or re-show all of the examples in that video

197
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,280
of various agents, both government and private, who are salivating at the opportunity to de-anonymize

198
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,660
people for political ends.

199
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,760
So I'd recommend you go check that one out if you're interested.

200
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,580
The TLDR is, we've known for a while that anonymous speech is required to speak truth

201
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,580
to power.

202
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,500
Power has its own ways of defending itself and promoting its interests.

203
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,400
While the common person is easily destroyed by power, anonymity is necessary for the common

204
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,920
person to have a voice, to be able to speak freely and criticize those in power.

205
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,540
Whenever those in power come for free speech, they start by coming for anonymous speech.

206
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,280
The first rule of the internet, when I was young, was don't tell people your real name

207
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
or address.

208
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,720
You don't know who's out there, you don't know who's saving your info.

209
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,480
Keep what is private, private.

210
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,240
That ethic was washed away by the popularity of social media.

211
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,720
The convenience and novelty of being able to find old classmates on Facebook or tweet

212
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,920
at your favorite celebs on Twitter outweighed any privacy concerns.

213
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,360
And while older people like me might grumble at the slow encroachment of these services

214
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,480
from having to provide Twitter with a phone number or having to show Facebook a photo

215
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,040
ID, we complied because everybody is on these centralized services.

216
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,860
And the Zoomers weren't even around to experience what it was like before.

217
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,880
To them, TikTok sending China all your data is just a normal thing.

218
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,980
Like why are you complaining?

219
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,980
Everyone does this.

220
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,380
Well, we're complaining because today's rampant cancel culture did not exist back

221
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,980
when anonymity was the default.

222
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,780
There are things that I've posted in my past that if they went viral, I would absolutely

223
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,780
be banned from everywhere.

224
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,840
I'm not even talking about the ICE tweet, that's not even close to how edgy 14 year

225
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,360
old dev was online.

226
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,700
People are getting destroyed as adults over shit they posted on Twitter as a child.

227
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,140
Stuff that wouldn't be out of place on Battle.net or Xbox Live back in the day.

228
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,020
When it happens to a leftoid like Sarah Jong or something, I laugh because they are the

229
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,400
people who wanted this to be the standard in the first place.

230
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,060
And now it's backfiring against them.

231
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,320
But it should not be the standard.

232
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,200
Most people who want to abolish anonymity, and this explicitly does not apply to Jordan

233
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,280
Peterson, desire it for ideological reasons.

234
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,840
It's not just getting canceled for old edgy tweets.

235
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:16,000
Look at how leftoids react when, for example, a 24 year old has consensual sex with a 36

236
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
year old.

237
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,240
Or a celebrity gets with a fangirl at a meetup after hours.

238
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,320
Or hell, an employee works for a boss at a normal ass job.

239
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,440
They're all screaming about power imbalances.

240
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,560
To the point that even if the people involved are totally fine and 100% consented to everything,

241
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,080
to them it's still an improper relationship.

242
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,160
To me, the natural response is, who the fuck are you to stick your nose into my business?

243
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,000
But the leftoids don't care about privacy as something to be valued.

244
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,200
You all know already, Mark's on the Jewish Question, where he dismantles the liberal right

245
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
of association.

246
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,960
We'll fast forward through that part of the video, I've talked about it a dozen

247
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
times already.

248
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,560
In the eyes of the left, it's private is not actually reason enough to leave it alone.

249
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,240
They reject the very concept of privacy because everything is political.

250
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,240
The personal is political.

251
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,880
And if it's political, then it's open to public inquiry because that's what politics

252
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
is.

253
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
The domain of the public.

254
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,520
I will always oppose this logic.

255
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:07,360
Hell, in Canada, the liberal argument for gay rights is explicitly an argument of privacy.

256
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,760
Where Prime Minister Trudeau, not the current one, his father, famously said, the state

257
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,920
has no place in the bedrooms of the nation.

258
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,800
To reject privacy rights is to say that the state actually does have a place in the bedrooms

259
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
of the nation.

260
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,920
And that's something that I can't abide by.

261
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,800
Abolishing the anonymous is only one such push.

262
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,040
Digital ID is a second one.

263
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,280
Obviously, you should have an ID if you're going to go vote, but the vote you tally is

264
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
still a secret one.

265
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,880
You still do it in private because you recognize the intimidation factor of having someone

266
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,680
look over your shoulder while you cast your ballot.

267
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,280
But nonetheless, we've seen a lot of strange ID takes.

268
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,040
During COVID, it was all about vaccine passports, not a vaccine card that you have to show once

269
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,820
to sign up for school, but a pass on your phone that you must keep on you at all times

270
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,600
and have it scanned at any place that you go to outside of your house and in some places

271
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,920
show it to the cops on demand, even as you just walk around town.

272
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,860
And that is slowly morphing into a more generalized digital ID kept on your phone at all times,

273
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,400
tracking your locations and activities.

274
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,100
I know this sounds like Alex Jones type stuff, and it's not happening yet, but there are

275
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,760
absolutely fringe elements pushing for this sort of thing.

276
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,040
And in general, we are slowly moving closer to a more surveillance heavy world.

277
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,600
The push for digital money is cut from the same cloth where some places are looking into

278
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,840
abolishing cash entirely in order to more easily track people's purchases.

279
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,200
China's even experimented with digital money that has a time limit that you've got to spend

280
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,400
or else it vanishes in order to prevent people from saving up resources.

281
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,320
And of course, there's that oft talked about WEF article.

282
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
It's 2030.

283
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
I own nothing.

284
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,040
I have no privacy and life has never been better.

285
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,120
You know, if Klaus Schwab didn't want people to think he was some insane wannabe dictator

286
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,520
looking to consolidate the entire planet under a new world order through mass impoverishment

287
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,100
and collectivization of everyone and everything, he probably shouldn't have dreamed that something

288
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,180
as insane sounding as this.

289
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,640
And by the way, this isn't just some WEF brain conspiracy.

290
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:51,020
In the UK, the Criminal Finances Act of 2017 introduced the Unexplained Wealth Order, which

291
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:56,080
allows for the confiscation of property without proving any law was broken by reversing that

292
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,220
burden of proof.

293
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,320
If you can't prove that you made your money in a way that the government approves of,

294
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
they will take it from you.

295
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,400
And one province in Canada, British Columbia, has recently stated they intend to introduce

296
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,520
a similar program.

297
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,080
In both cases, they claim it'll only be used to seize the capital gained by organized crime.

298
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,420
But it's not hard to see how just such an apparatus can be turned on any citizen should

299
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,380
the government suddenly decree that normal behavior is criminal.

300
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,780
And again, during COVID, we saw a lot of normal behavior become criminal.

301
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:27,140
All of this stuff flies in the face of privacy, of anonymity, of the right to disconnect from

302
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,660
the rest of society and enjoy a private, personal life.

303
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,800
The truth is, anonymity is both good and necessary.

304
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,220
We already know too much about each other.

305
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,540
The phrase, good fences make good neighbors, is known for a reason.

306
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,620
I don't buy any of this if you have nothing to fear, then you have nothing to hide nonsense.

307
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,460
And I'm honestly surprised that Jordan Peterson is arriving at the anti-anonymous point.

308
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:54,780
Here Jordan, let me describe the fatal flaw of your position in your own words.

309
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,860
At the same time, I also recognize the flip side of the argument.

310
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,220
It certainly seems ridiculous to me that anonymous trolls and haters can compile information

311
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,500
on me that, while no reasonable person would see that it's bad, could be presented in such

312
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,020
a light by a bad faith actor only for the purposes of hurting me, all behind the safety

313
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,020
of anonymity.

314
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,740
That is what the supposedly compassionate, harm-reduction focused leftoids did to Jordan

315
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,660
Peterson when they were shitting on him for his addiction.

316
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:23,040
It's what happened to Sargon, where people keep spreading around the UKIP rape man thing

317
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,940
and the depends on the child thing, which is literally just him steelmanning Amos Yee's

318
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,300
position while debating him.

319
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,140
It can seem exceptionally cruel when anonymous actors can move to destroy you over nothing

320
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,140
using outright lies and you can't do anything about it.

321
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,960
It's like I said at the beginning of the video, a cry of free speech is the cry of the oppressed,

322
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
the outsider.

323
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,400
The establishment doesn't really need free speech, and this is why a lot of people are

324
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,920
free speech extremists when on the fringe and suddenly become a lot more censorious

325
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,520
after their station has been razed.

326
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,400
Hell, you can even make the argument that I've done this, in some extreme circumstances.

327
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,960
For example, while I am still very pro-free speech, and I absolutely do tolerate criticism

328
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,480
and mockery of me, I had to purge my Discord of a bunch of retards after Discord sent me

329
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,320
an email saying that people had been organizing raids out of my server against other communities.

330
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,760
And after I began to investigate some of the side, lesser-used channels on my server,

331
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,280
I discovered a group of people who didn't actually watch my content at all.

332
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,720
They didn't actually give a shit about me or my community, they actively chased away

333
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,400
new fans for fun, they posted stuff that was blatantly against Discord TOS, and they were

334
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,780
simply using my server as a way to plan out harassment against other servers because they

335
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:33,480
heard I was a free speech guy, and so therefore they expected I wouldn't come down on them.

336
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,440
So I nuked them all into oblivion, and now they sit on a side server crying that I'm

337
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,060
actually not pro-free speech at all.

338
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,400
The point is, you can have good ideals, but they're always going to be challenged when

339
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,880
those ideals impact the real world.

340
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,480
Eventually, some ridiculous edge case will cause you to go against your ethics.

341
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,480
But at the same time, we also know, from the French Revolution, from the Russian Revolution,

342
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,020
from countless other examples, that if you step outside of the bounds of ethics every

343
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,460
time there's a seemingly good reason to, it's not going to end well for you.

344
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,900
So what does that leave us with in regards to Jordan Peterson?

345
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,160
I understand his desire here, but I must disagree.

346
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,480
Hell, even old Jordan Peterson must disagree, considering the extent to which he himself

347
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,000
has written about the virtues of privacy.

348
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,360
I'm not directly comparing removing anonymous online accounts to the Chinese surveillance

349
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,760
state, with social credit and expiring money, and a phone which tracks you and tells you

350
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,360
to report to a government facility if you post the wrong opinions online.

351
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,160
Yes, that's actually happening in China right now.

352
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,880
It's what they turned their COVID tracking apparatus into.

353
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,400
What I'm saying is, there is a real slippery slope here, and unlike a lot of other slippery

354
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,440
slopes that people talk about, this one's actually possible.

355
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,800
And there's a lot of people here, now, who want to make it happen.

356
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,420
Therefore, I'm not willing to give an inch on this issue.

357
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,200
Being anonymous is a necessary component of a free society.

358
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,400
And if it means that public figures, including myself, occasionally get made a fool of, then

359
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,040
that is a price worth paying.

360
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,360
Hey there, GigaChads.

361
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,800
If you're watching this on release day, that's December 8th, 2022.

362
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,680
Come back to the channel tonight, at 7.30 PM EST.

363
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,800
That's 4.30 for the West Coast, and uh, 12.30 in the UK.

364
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,400
Sorry, Eurocucks.

365
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,960
Because tonight is the night of the 2022 Video Game Awards, and I'm gonna be streaming them.

366
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,480
Get your Mountain Dew and Doritos ready, because, yeah, come on, we're all losers here.

367
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,840
And let's watch it together.

368
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,200
This YouTube channel tonight, or my Twitch channel?

369
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Either or.

370
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
I'll see you there.

371
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,400
I love you.
