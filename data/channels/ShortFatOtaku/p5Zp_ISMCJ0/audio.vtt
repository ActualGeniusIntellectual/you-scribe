00:00.000 --> 00:08.480
It's time for a round of Guess That Tweet!

00:08.480 --> 00:09.840
Who tweeted this out?

00:09.840 --> 00:14.440
By failing to separate the anonymous, cowardly troll demons from real people in the comments

00:14.440 --> 00:19.260
section, YouTube and other social media platforms are enabling sadistic, Machiavellian psychopaths

00:19.260 --> 00:20.480
and narcissists.

00:20.480 --> 00:26.920
Was it A. Anita Sarkeesian, B. Andrew Torba, C. Any of the BreadTubers, or D. Jordan Peterson?

00:27.400 --> 00:30.160
Well you saw the title of the video, you already know it's Jordan Peterson.

00:30.160 --> 00:34.280
Peterson's going viral right now for arguing against anonymity online, and he's getting

00:34.280 --> 00:38.340
a lot of pushback from the right who have overwhelmingly taken up the cause of free

00:38.340 --> 00:41.560
speech in the past decade after the left discarded it.

00:41.560 --> 00:45.560
What's funny is, the tweet does actually sound like something those other people would

00:45.560 --> 00:46.560
say.

00:46.560 --> 00:51.200
Anita Sarkeesian is a notorious Gamergate-era censor who wanted sexual and violent content

00:51.200 --> 00:54.760
stricken out of video games, judging of course from a left-wing perspective, making her a

00:54.760 --> 00:59.640
mirror image of the previous big gaming censorship baddie, Jack Thompson, on the right.

00:59.640 --> 01:04.120
Andrew Torba started Gab in 2016, the alt-tech twitter, and marketed it as a free speech

01:04.120 --> 01:05.120
zone.

01:05.120 --> 01:09.020
But as time went on and he radicalized, he began to ban more and more types of speech,

01:09.020 --> 01:15.080
first beginning with porn in 2019 and then branching out.

01:15.080 --> 01:19.120
BreadTubers are just well-known for free speech that helps them out and censors their enemies.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.860
They're just partisans who have no principles beyond what's good for them.

01:21.960 --> 01:22.960
But Jordan Peterson?

01:22.960 --> 01:25.140
Why is he taking an anti-Anon stance?

01:25.140 --> 01:29.340
Peterson's initial boost into the spotlight was specifically over free speech issues,

01:29.340 --> 01:31.300
compelled speech in Canada, more specifically.

01:31.300 --> 01:35.280
This event happened in the wider context of the left abandoning free speech as a virtue

01:35.280 --> 01:36.960
back in the early to mid-2010s.

01:36.960 --> 01:40.020
As I've said many times before, I was a young lefty, and the left, when I was a part

01:40.020 --> 01:43.580
of it, was heavily invested in free speech as a core right.

01:43.580 --> 01:47.940
The right-wing of the time were the older boomer Christian censors, wanting speech banned

01:47.940 --> 01:48.940
in the name of their religion.

01:49.020 --> 01:52.780
And it was the left-wing who said, no, the First Amendment means everyone can speak,

01:52.780 --> 01:56.600
even if it's speech you don't like, even if it's speech you find offensive.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.700
But then came the political realignment.

01:58.700 --> 02:03.080
As the left gained more and more institutional power, they dropped free speech as a virtue.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.540
It was no longer useful to them.

02:04.540 --> 02:08.740
Its purpose was to have free speech, use it to subvert institutions and take control,

02:08.740 --> 02:11.520
and then ban free speech to protect their new order.

02:11.520 --> 02:15.100
And Jordan Peterson is one of the many people who were caught unaware of that shift and

02:15.100 --> 02:17.100
slammed into a wall because of it.

02:17.100 --> 02:21.100
In fact, that was one of the reasons the pro-Gamergate people felt so betrayed during

02:21.100 --> 02:23.060
that 2014 culture war.

02:23.060 --> 02:26.660
The wider culture had demonized gamers for decades, using the same arguments that they

02:26.660 --> 02:28.840
used on Rock and Roll and D&D.

02:28.840 --> 02:32.580
Gamers expected their enthusiast press to stand up for them, as they had during previous

02:32.580 --> 02:33.580
moral panics.

02:33.580 --> 02:37.540
But now that it was the ethics of that enthusiast press themselves that was being called into

02:37.540 --> 02:39.600
question, they turned on their own audiences.

02:39.600 --> 02:43.180
Good faith questions from the gamers were replied to with accusations of sexism and

02:43.180 --> 02:47.340
racism on the side of the journos, something that Anita Sarkeesian was a small part of.

02:47.340 --> 02:48.340
Yeah, only a small part.

02:48.340 --> 02:51.420
I know the narrative nowadays that she was the centerpiece, but really, having been a

02:51.420 --> 02:54.060
part of it myself, Anita inserted herself for clout.

02:54.060 --> 02:55.480
Nobody actually cared about her.

02:55.480 --> 02:59.060
But the reason I'm going on this side tangent is because a lot of the time, when a free

02:59.060 --> 03:04.180
speech advocate runs into speech they explicitly do not like, or sometimes, just after they've

03:04.180 --> 03:07.040
gained power, suddenly, censorship seems like a good idea.

03:07.040 --> 03:11.420
From hate speech is not free speech morons on the left to what offends me doesn't count

03:11.420 --> 03:15.380
as free speech morons on the right, everyone is carving out their own little exceptions

03:15.380 --> 03:16.380
to these rules.

03:16.380 --> 03:20.300
Hell, some Muslims believe that the old blasphemy laws need to come back, at least for their

03:20.300 --> 03:21.300
god.

03:21.300 --> 03:22.300
Anyone else's existence.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.180
And that's exactly what mockery is.

03:24.180 --> 03:28.620
What the French have done, for example, has actually disrespected our beliefs and our

03:28.620 --> 03:32.800
existence and therefore I don't think it can even be categorized as free speech.

03:32.800 --> 03:36.820
Free speech can only be free speech as long as it respects other people.

03:36.820 --> 03:43.980
If anyone is doing a mockery of a religion, of a prophet, do they deserve to pay the ultimate

03:43.980 --> 03:44.980
price?

03:44.980 --> 03:47.180
Do they deserve to die because of that?

03:47.180 --> 03:51.660
That is a great question and that actually brings up another concept of death penalty

03:51.660 --> 03:55.340
and I think that's a completely different question right now that you're asking, but

03:55.340 --> 03:59.900
at the moment I think that we should focus on identifying as what they did was wrong

03:59.900 --> 04:03.380
because a lot of people are saying, oh, you know, it's free speech, it's not mockery.

04:03.380 --> 04:06.200
I think right now what we need to do is get to the root of the problem.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.920
Mockery is not free speech.

04:07.920 --> 04:14.080
What would you suggest as an appropriate penalty for the mockery of a religion or a prophet?

04:14.080 --> 04:16.320
I wouldn't like to comment on this at this time.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.600
And yeah, liberal society does this sort of thing too.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.920
We have some concept of slander and defamation.

04:20.920 --> 04:24.500
A narrow concept where it requires proving that the speaker knows what they're saying

04:24.500 --> 04:27.400
is false and is only saying it to damage the target.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.920
But nonetheless, it's still a restriction on speech.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.920
Another restriction we accept are credible threats or credible incitement.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.960
Credible, meaning that the speech will lead to violent action.

04:35.960 --> 04:39.320
Believe it or not, though, one type of restriction that everyone thinks we have, but we actually

04:39.320 --> 04:43.400
don't, is the whole shouting fire in a crowded theater thing that's actually allowed.

04:43.400 --> 04:47.600
The point is, people who are on the margins of society tend to lean on free speech rights

04:47.600 --> 04:48.880
because it benefits them.

04:48.880 --> 04:51.880
Free speech is what allows them to spread the word of their unorthodox views.

04:51.880 --> 04:55.560
But once the margin becomes the new core, or maybe not even that far, just gain some

04:55.560 --> 04:59.440
position of stability or influence, suddenly free speech no longer benefits them, but it

04:59.440 --> 05:00.440
hurts them.

05:00.440 --> 05:03.320
Now the new margin can speak and undermine their new rule.

05:03.680 --> 05:06.960
From a political realist's point of view, calling for free speech when you're losing

05:06.960 --> 05:11.380
and calling for censorship along your rules when you're winning is the path to victory.

05:11.380 --> 05:13.480
So is that what Jordan Peterson's doing?

05:13.480 --> 05:14.480
I don't know.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.080
But we can look at his previous stances on this topic.

05:17.080 --> 05:20.440
After Peterson received pushback during his compelled speech controversy, there was a

05:20.440 --> 05:24.060
chorus of voices condemning the loss of free speech in academia.

05:24.060 --> 05:27.640
Especially since that's one of the most important places for free speech to be.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.600
Academia is where you're supposed to get challenged, learn new ideas, discover new

05:30.600 --> 05:34.600
things, through open inquiry, and to see a chilling effect hit the university was scary

05:34.600 --> 05:35.600
indeed.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.800
And that chilling effect began to spread far beyond just Jordan Peterson's own University

05:38.800 --> 05:39.800
of Toronto.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.560
The case of Lindsay Shepherd should be one that you all know, at least if you've been

05:42.560 --> 05:44.200
watching my channel for the past few years.

05:44.200 --> 05:48.080
Where, back in 2017, in her capacity as a teacher's assistant teaching a class, she

05:48.080 --> 05:51.000
brought up Jordan Peterson in an academic context.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.640
Shepherd was hauled in front of the head of her academic program, where it was claimed

05:53.640 --> 05:58.400
that LGBTQ students had filed complaints against her for talking about Jordan Peterson in a

05:58.400 --> 06:02.120
politically neutral manner, which had created a toxic climate for the students.

06:02.120 --> 06:06.520
Because, just as you should not talk about, and I quote, Hitler or Milo Yiannopoulos in

06:06.520 --> 06:09.600
a politically neutral way, the same goes for Jordan Peterson.

06:09.600 --> 06:17.520
So just to give you some context about Jordan Peterson is, he is a figure that's basically

06:17.520 --> 06:20.120
highly involved with the alt-right.

06:20.120 --> 06:30.400
He lectures about basically critiquing feminism, critiquing trans rights, critiquing white

06:30.400 --> 06:31.400
supremacy.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.400
I follow him.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.400
Or not critiquing you.

06:33.400 --> 06:36.600
But the thing is, can you shield people from those ideas?

06:36.600 --> 06:41.840
Am I supposed to comfort them and make sure that they are insulated away from this?

06:41.840 --> 06:44.280
Like is that what the point of this is?

06:44.280 --> 06:47.720
Because to me that is so against what a university is about.

06:47.720 --> 06:49.440
I introduced it critically.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.560
Like I said, it was in the spirit of debate.

06:52.560 --> 06:59.160
Okay, in the spirit of the debate is slightly different than being like, okay this is a

06:59.160 --> 07:02.160
problematic idea that we want to unpack.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.520
But that's taking sides.

07:04.520 --> 07:08.040
It's taking sides for me to be like, oh look at this guy, like everything that comes out

07:08.040 --> 07:11.120
of his mouth is BS but we're going to watch anyway.

07:11.120 --> 07:16.400
So I understand the position that you're coming from and your positionality, but the reality

07:16.400 --> 07:23.400
is that it has created a toxic climate for some of the students.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.400
How many?

07:24.400 --> 07:25.400
It's great.

07:25.400 --> 07:26.400
Who?

07:26.400 --> 07:27.400
Like how many?

07:27.400 --> 07:28.400
Okay.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.400
One?

07:29.400 --> 07:30.400
May I speak?

07:30.400 --> 07:34.600
I have no concept of like how many people complained, like what their complaint was.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.400
You haven't shown me the complaint.

07:36.400 --> 07:42.840
Yes, I understand that this is upsetting, but there's also confidentiality matters.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.480
The number of people is confidential?

07:44.480 --> 07:45.480
Yes.

07:45.560 --> 07:49.160
I don't see what's transphobic about showing a video of Jordan Peterson.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.160
He's a real person.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.760
He's out there.

07:51.760 --> 08:02.400
He is a real person, but he is a real person who has engaged in targeted behavior or targeting

08:02.400 --> 08:04.080
of trans students.

08:04.080 --> 08:10.680
This is basically like neutrally playing a speech by Hitler or Milo Yiannopoulos from

08:10.680 --> 08:11.680
gamergate.

08:11.680 --> 08:14.800
Sheppard was threatened with disciplinary action if she didn't comply with the university's

08:14.800 --> 08:18.760
demands, but an investigation later discovered that no complaint had actually been filed

08:18.760 --> 08:21.840
by any student and she had not violated any school policy.

08:21.840 --> 08:26.520
It turns out the entire thing was cooked up by her academic supervisor, Nathan Rambucana,

08:26.520 --> 08:28.960
who had his own leftist political bias.

08:28.960 --> 08:31.560
Lindsay Sheppard's censure is just one example of many.

08:31.560 --> 08:35.120
How many times have people pulled fire alarms or called in bomb threats on speakers that

08:35.120 --> 08:39.280
they didn't politically align with, generally right-leaning speakers and left-leaning protesters?

08:39.280 --> 08:43.160
Again, as somebody who was a lefty before I grew up, that was wild for me to witness.

08:43.160 --> 08:45.320
The left suddenly being against academic freedom.

08:45.320 --> 08:49.800
It's at the point where, for example, UBC gave a questionnaire asking students about

08:49.800 --> 08:52.720
the morality of Jordan Peterson's free speech stance.

08:52.720 --> 08:56.060
And students overwhelmingly didn't trust that the school wouldn't punish them for

08:56.060 --> 08:58.240
saying other than, I disagree.

08:58.240 --> 09:02.600
So Jordan Peterson, until the tweet that we're talking about today, has pretty much universally

09:02.600 --> 09:07.140
come down on the free speech side of things, even as a storm raged around him over his

09:07.140 --> 09:08.540
commitment to that stance.

09:08.540 --> 09:11.200
And he has faced some true ugliness for that commitment.

09:11.200 --> 09:15.320
When he destroyed Kathy Newman in a debate back in 2018, he was considered a misogynist

09:15.320 --> 09:18.440
for not just bending over and letting her have her way with him.

09:18.440 --> 09:21.800
And Newman continued to play the victim card for years afterwards.

09:21.800 --> 09:25.840
Countless no-names have called him an incel, a misogynist, a men's rights activist, a

09:25.840 --> 09:28.200
fascist, a racist, a transphobe, whatever.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.800
They took every single thing the left claims to hate and just tarred and feathered him

09:31.800 --> 09:33.340
with it to see what would stick.

09:33.340 --> 09:37.520
And when they finally found something they could actually hurt him with, namely his wife's

09:37.520 --> 09:41.700
cancer diagnosis, her near-death experience, and his resulting drug addiction, they latched

09:41.700 --> 09:43.620
onto that for all that it was fucking worth.

09:43.620 --> 09:48.040
I am not surprised he came out of that experience a significantly more negative man than he

09:48.040 --> 09:49.040
was before.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.320
It's no secret that I once liked Jordan Peterson quite a lot.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.220
His psychology takes are still top tier.

09:53.220 --> 09:57.400
And most of what he says otherwise is useful, if a bit generic, self-help stuff.

09:57.400 --> 10:00.840
But it's after the Elliot Page thing a few months back that I feel like he really began

10:00.840 --> 10:01.840
to lose the plot.

10:01.840 --> 10:04.600
I still listen to his old speeches occasionally too, they're quite good.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.520
But he seems a lot more cynical now, a lot more cold to the world.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.720
Which brings us back to his original tweet, his sudden reversal on free speech.

10:10.720 --> 10:11.720
Only not exactly.

10:11.720 --> 10:14.360
He's talking about being anonymous here, not free speech.

10:14.360 --> 10:18.960
In 2021, I did a 30 minute video detailing the link between those two concepts.

10:18.960 --> 10:22.500
I don't want to go over it entirely again or re-show all of the examples in that video

10:22.500 --> 10:27.280
of various agents, both government and private, who are salivating at the opportunity to de-anonymize

10:27.280 --> 10:28.660
people for political ends.

10:28.660 --> 10:30.760
So I'd recommend you go check that one out if you're interested.

10:30.760 --> 10:35.580
The TLDR is, we've known for a while that anonymous speech is required to speak truth

10:35.580 --> 10:36.580
to power.

10:36.580 --> 10:39.500
Power has its own ways of defending itself and promoting its interests.

10:39.500 --> 10:43.400
While the common person is easily destroyed by power, anonymity is necessary for the common

10:43.400 --> 10:46.920
person to have a voice, to be able to speak freely and criticize those in power.

10:46.920 --> 10:51.540
Whenever those in power come for free speech, they start by coming for anonymous speech.

10:51.540 --> 10:55.280
The first rule of the internet, when I was young, was don't tell people your real name

10:55.280 --> 10:56.280
or address.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.720
You don't know who's out there, you don't know who's saving your info.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.480
Keep what is private, private.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.240
That ethic was washed away by the popularity of social media.

11:03.240 --> 11:06.720
The convenience and novelty of being able to find old classmates on Facebook or tweet

11:06.720 --> 11:09.920
at your favorite celebs on Twitter outweighed any privacy concerns.

11:09.920 --> 11:14.360
And while older people like me might grumble at the slow encroachment of these services

11:14.360 --> 11:17.480
from having to provide Twitter with a phone number or having to show Facebook a photo

11:17.480 --> 11:21.040
ID, we complied because everybody is on these centralized services.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.860
And the Zoomers weren't even around to experience what it was like before.

11:23.860 --> 11:26.880
To them, TikTok sending China all your data is just a normal thing.

11:26.880 --> 11:27.980
Like why are you complaining?

11:27.980 --> 11:28.980
Everyone does this.

11:28.980 --> 11:33.380
Well, we're complaining because today's rampant cancel culture did not exist back

11:33.380 --> 11:34.980
when anonymity was the default.

11:34.980 --> 11:38.780
There are things that I've posted in my past that if they went viral, I would absolutely

11:38.780 --> 11:39.780
be banned from everywhere.

11:39.780 --> 11:42.840
I'm not even talking about the ICE tweet, that's not even close to how edgy 14 year

11:42.840 --> 11:44.360
old dev was online.

11:44.360 --> 11:48.700
People are getting destroyed as adults over shit they posted on Twitter as a child.

11:48.700 --> 11:52.140
Stuff that wouldn't be out of place on Battle.net or Xbox Live back in the day.

11:52.140 --> 11:56.020
When it happens to a leftoid like Sarah Jong or something, I laugh because they are the

11:56.020 --> 11:58.400
people who wanted this to be the standard in the first place.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.060
And now it's backfiring against them.

12:00.060 --> 12:02.320
But it should not be the standard.

12:02.320 --> 12:06.200
Most people who want to abolish anonymity, and this explicitly does not apply to Jordan

12:06.200 --> 12:08.280
Peterson, desire it for ideological reasons.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.840
It's not just getting canceled for old edgy tweets.

12:10.840 --> 12:16.000
Look at how leftoids react when, for example, a 24 year old has consensual sex with a 36

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
year old.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.240
Or a celebrity gets with a fangirl at a meetup after hours.

12:19.240 --> 12:22.320
Or hell, an employee works for a boss at a normal ass job.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.440
They're all screaming about power imbalances.

12:24.440 --> 12:29.560
To the point that even if the people involved are totally fine and 100% consented to everything,

12:29.560 --> 12:32.080
to them it's still an improper relationship.

12:32.080 --> 12:36.160
To me, the natural response is, who the fuck are you to stick your nose into my business?

12:36.160 --> 12:40.000
But the leftoids don't care about privacy as something to be valued.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.200
You all know already, Mark's on the Jewish Question, where he dismantles the liberal right

12:43.200 --> 12:44.200
of association.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.960
We'll fast forward through that part of the video, I've talked about it a dozen

12:45.960 --> 12:46.960
times already.

12:46.960 --> 12:50.560
In the eyes of the left, it's private is not actually reason enough to leave it alone.

12:50.560 --> 12:54.240
They reject the very concept of privacy because everything is political.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.240
The personal is political.

12:55.240 --> 12:58.880
And if it's political, then it's open to public inquiry because that's what politics

12:58.880 --> 12:59.880
is.

12:59.880 --> 13:00.880
The domain of the public.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.520
I will always oppose this logic.

13:02.520 --> 13:07.360
Hell, in Canada, the liberal argument for gay rights is explicitly an argument of privacy.

13:07.360 --> 13:10.760
Where Prime Minister Trudeau, not the current one, his father, famously said, the state

13:10.760 --> 13:12.920
has no place in the bedrooms of the nation.

13:12.920 --> 13:16.800
To reject privacy rights is to say that the state actually does have a place in the bedrooms

13:16.800 --> 13:17.800
of the nation.

13:17.800 --> 13:18.920
And that's something that I can't abide by.

13:18.920 --> 13:21.800
Abolishing the anonymous is only one such push.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.040
Digital ID is a second one.

13:23.040 --> 13:26.280
Obviously, you should have an ID if you're going to go vote, but the vote you tally is

13:26.280 --> 13:27.280
still a secret one.

13:27.280 --> 13:30.880
You still do it in private because you recognize the intimidation factor of having someone

13:30.880 --> 13:32.680
look over your shoulder while you cast your ballot.

13:32.680 --> 13:35.280
But nonetheless, we've seen a lot of strange ID takes.

13:35.280 --> 13:39.040
During COVID, it was all about vaccine passports, not a vaccine card that you have to show once

13:39.040 --> 13:42.820
to sign up for school, but a pass on your phone that you must keep on you at all times

13:42.820 --> 13:46.600
and have it scanned at any place that you go to outside of your house and in some places

13:46.600 --> 13:49.920
show it to the cops on demand, even as you just walk around town.

13:49.920 --> 13:54.860
And that is slowly morphing into a more generalized digital ID kept on your phone at all times,

13:54.860 --> 13:56.400
tracking your locations and activities.

13:56.400 --> 14:00.100
I know this sounds like Alex Jones type stuff, and it's not happening yet, but there are

14:00.100 --> 14:02.760
absolutely fringe elements pushing for this sort of thing.

14:02.760 --> 14:07.040
And in general, we are slowly moving closer to a more surveillance heavy world.

14:07.040 --> 14:10.600
The push for digital money is cut from the same cloth where some places are looking into

14:10.600 --> 14:14.840
abolishing cash entirely in order to more easily track people's purchases.

14:14.840 --> 14:18.200
China's even experimented with digital money that has a time limit that you've got to spend

14:18.200 --> 14:21.400
or else it vanishes in order to prevent people from saving up resources.

14:21.400 --> 14:24.320
And of course, there's that oft talked about WEF article.

14:24.320 --> 14:25.320
It's 2030.

14:25.320 --> 14:26.320
I own nothing.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.040
I have no privacy and life has never been better.

14:28.040 --> 14:32.120
You know, if Klaus Schwab didn't want people to think he was some insane wannabe dictator

14:32.120 --> 14:36.520
looking to consolidate the entire planet under a new world order through mass impoverishment

14:36.520 --> 14:40.100
and collectivization of everyone and everything, he probably shouldn't have dreamed that something

14:40.100 --> 14:42.180
as insane sounding as this.

14:42.180 --> 14:45.640
And by the way, this isn't just some WEF brain conspiracy.

14:45.640 --> 14:51.020
In the UK, the Criminal Finances Act of 2017 introduced the Unexplained Wealth Order, which

14:51.020 --> 14:56.080
allows for the confiscation of property without proving any law was broken by reversing that

14:56.080 --> 14:57.220
burden of proof.

14:57.220 --> 15:00.320
If you can't prove that you made your money in a way that the government approves of,

15:00.320 --> 15:01.320
they will take it from you.

15:01.320 --> 15:05.400
And one province in Canada, British Columbia, has recently stated they intend to introduce

15:05.400 --> 15:06.520
a similar program.

15:06.520 --> 15:11.080
In both cases, they claim it'll only be used to seize the capital gained by organized crime.

15:11.080 --> 15:15.420
But it's not hard to see how just such an apparatus can be turned on any citizen should

15:15.420 --> 15:18.380
the government suddenly decree that normal behavior is criminal.

15:18.380 --> 15:22.780
And again, during COVID, we saw a lot of normal behavior become criminal.

15:22.780 --> 15:27.140
All of this stuff flies in the face of privacy, of anonymity, of the right to disconnect from

15:27.140 --> 15:30.660
the rest of society and enjoy a private, personal life.

15:30.660 --> 15:33.800
The truth is, anonymity is both good and necessary.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.220
We already know too much about each other.

15:35.220 --> 15:38.540
The phrase, good fences make good neighbors, is known for a reason.

15:38.540 --> 15:42.620
I don't buy any of this if you have nothing to fear, then you have nothing to hide nonsense.

15:42.620 --> 15:46.460
And I'm honestly surprised that Jordan Peterson is arriving at the anti-anonymous point.

15:46.460 --> 15:54.780
Here Jordan, let me describe the fatal flaw of your position in your own words.

15:54.780 --> 15:57.860
At the same time, I also recognize the flip side of the argument.

15:57.860 --> 16:02.220
It certainly seems ridiculous to me that anonymous trolls and haters can compile information

16:02.220 --> 16:06.500
on me that, while no reasonable person would see that it's bad, could be presented in such

16:06.500 --> 16:11.020
a light by a bad faith actor only for the purposes of hurting me, all behind the safety

16:11.020 --> 16:12.020
of anonymity.

16:12.420 --> 16:16.740
That is what the supposedly compassionate, harm-reduction focused leftoids did to Jordan

16:16.740 --> 16:18.660
Peterson when they were shitting on him for his addiction.

16:18.660 --> 16:23.040
It's what happened to Sargon, where people keep spreading around the UKIP rape man thing

16:23.040 --> 16:26.940
and the depends on the child thing, which is literally just him steelmanning Amos Yee's

16:26.940 --> 16:28.300
position while debating him.

16:28.300 --> 16:33.140
It can seem exceptionally cruel when anonymous actors can move to destroy you over nothing

16:33.140 --> 16:36.140
using outright lies and you can't do anything about it.

16:36.140 --> 16:39.960
It's like I said at the beginning of the video, a cry of free speech is the cry of the oppressed,

16:39.960 --> 16:40.960
the outsider.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.400
The establishment doesn't really need free speech, and this is why a lot of people are

16:44.400 --> 16:48.920
free speech extremists when on the fringe and suddenly become a lot more censorious

16:48.920 --> 16:50.520
after their station has been razed.

16:50.520 --> 16:54.400
Hell, you can even make the argument that I've done this, in some extreme circumstances.

16:54.400 --> 16:58.960
For example, while I am still very pro-free speech, and I absolutely do tolerate criticism

16:58.960 --> 17:03.480
and mockery of me, I had to purge my Discord of a bunch of retards after Discord sent me

17:03.480 --> 17:08.320
an email saying that people had been organizing raids out of my server against other communities.

17:08.320 --> 17:12.760
And after I began to investigate some of the side, lesser-used channels on my server,

17:12.760 --> 17:16.280
I discovered a group of people who didn't actually watch my content at all.

17:16.280 --> 17:19.720
They didn't actually give a shit about me or my community, they actively chased away

17:19.720 --> 17:24.400
new fans for fun, they posted stuff that was blatantly against Discord TOS, and they were

17:24.400 --> 17:28.780
simply using my server as a way to plan out harassment against other servers because they

17:28.780 --> 17:33.480
heard I was a free speech guy, and so therefore they expected I wouldn't come down on them.

17:33.480 --> 17:37.440
So I nuked them all into oblivion, and now they sit on a side server crying that I'm

17:37.440 --> 17:39.060
actually not pro-free speech at all.

17:39.060 --> 17:42.400
The point is, you can have good ideals, but they're always going to be challenged when

17:42.400 --> 17:44.880
those ideals impact the real world.

17:44.880 --> 17:48.480
Eventually, some ridiculous edge case will cause you to go against your ethics.

17:48.480 --> 17:52.480
But at the same time, we also know, from the French Revolution, from the Russian Revolution,

17:52.480 --> 17:56.020
from countless other examples, that if you step outside of the bounds of ethics every

17:56.020 --> 17:59.460
time there's a seemingly good reason to, it's not going to end well for you.

17:59.460 --> 18:01.900
So what does that leave us with in regards to Jordan Peterson?

18:01.900 --> 18:04.160
I understand his desire here, but I must disagree.

18:04.160 --> 18:08.480
Hell, even old Jordan Peterson must disagree, considering the extent to which he himself

18:08.480 --> 18:10.000
has written about the virtues of privacy.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.360
I'm not directly comparing removing anonymous online accounts to the Chinese surveillance

18:15.360 --> 18:18.760
state, with social credit and expiring money, and a phone which tracks you and tells you

18:18.760 --> 18:21.360
to report to a government facility if you post the wrong opinions online.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.160
Yes, that's actually happening in China right now.

18:23.160 --> 18:25.880
It's what they turned their COVID tracking apparatus into.

18:25.880 --> 18:30.400
What I'm saying is, there is a real slippery slope here, and unlike a lot of other slippery

18:30.400 --> 18:33.440
slopes that people talk about, this one's actually possible.

18:33.440 --> 18:36.800
And there's a lot of people here, now, who want to make it happen.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.420
Therefore, I'm not willing to give an inch on this issue.

18:39.420 --> 18:42.200
Being anonymous is a necessary component of a free society.

18:42.200 --> 18:46.400
And if it means that public figures, including myself, occasionally get made a fool of, then

18:46.400 --> 18:50.040
that is a price worth paying.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.360
Hey there, GigaChads.

18:51.360 --> 18:55.800
If you're watching this on release day, that's December 8th, 2022.

18:55.800 --> 18:59.680
Come back to the channel tonight, at 7.30 PM EST.

18:59.680 --> 19:03.800
That's 4.30 for the West Coast, and uh, 12.30 in the UK.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.400
Sorry, Eurocucks.

19:05.400 --> 19:10.960
Because tonight is the night of the 2022 Video Game Awards, and I'm gonna be streaming them.

19:10.960 --> 19:15.480
Get your Mountain Dew and Doritos ready, because, yeah, come on, we're all losers here.

19:15.480 --> 19:16.840
And let's watch it together.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.200
This YouTube channel tonight, or my Twitch channel?

19:19.200 --> 19:20.200
Either or.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.200
I'll see you there.

19:21.200 --> 19:21.400
I love you.
