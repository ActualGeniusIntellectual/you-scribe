0	8480	It's time for a round of Guess That Tweet!
8480	9840	Who tweeted this out?
9840	14440	By failing to separate the anonymous, cowardly troll demons from real people in the comments
14440	19260	section, YouTube and other social media platforms are enabling sadistic, Machiavellian psychopaths
19260	20480	and narcissists.
20480	26920	Was it A. Anita Sarkeesian, B. Andrew Torba, C. Any of the BreadTubers, or D. Jordan Peterson?
27400	30160	Well you saw the title of the video, you already know it's Jordan Peterson.
30160	34280	Peterson's going viral right now for arguing against anonymity online, and he's getting
34280	38340	a lot of pushback from the right who have overwhelmingly taken up the cause of free
38340	41560	speech in the past decade after the left discarded it.
41560	45560	What's funny is, the tweet does actually sound like something those other people would
45560	46560	say.
46560	51200	Anita Sarkeesian is a notorious Gamergate-era censor who wanted sexual and violent content
51200	54760	stricken out of video games, judging of course from a left-wing perspective, making her a
54760	59640	mirror image of the previous big gaming censorship baddie, Jack Thompson, on the right.
59640	64120	Andrew Torba started Gab in 2016, the alt-tech twitter, and marketed it as a free speech
64120	65120	zone.
65120	69020	But as time went on and he radicalized, he began to ban more and more types of speech,
69020	75080	first beginning with porn in 2019 and then branching out.
75080	79120	BreadTubers are just well-known for free speech that helps them out and censors their enemies.
79120	81860	They're just partisans who have no principles beyond what's good for them.
81960	82960	But Jordan Peterson?
82960	85140	Why is he taking an anti-Anon stance?
85140	89340	Peterson's initial boost into the spotlight was specifically over free speech issues,
89340	91300	compelled speech in Canada, more specifically.
91300	95280	This event happened in the wider context of the left abandoning free speech as a virtue
95280	96960	back in the early to mid-2010s.
96960	100020	As I've said many times before, I was a young lefty, and the left, when I was a part
100020	103580	of it, was heavily invested in free speech as a core right.
103580	107940	The right-wing of the time were the older boomer Christian censors, wanting speech banned
107940	108940	in the name of their religion.
109020	112780	And it was the left-wing who said, no, the First Amendment means everyone can speak,
112780	116600	even if it's speech you don't like, even if it's speech you find offensive.
116600	118700	But then came the political realignment.
118700	123080	As the left gained more and more institutional power, they dropped free speech as a virtue.
123080	124540	It was no longer useful to them.
124540	128740	Its purpose was to have free speech, use it to subvert institutions and take control,
128740	131520	and then ban free speech to protect their new order.
131520	135100	And Jordan Peterson is one of the many people who were caught unaware of that shift and
135100	137100	slammed into a wall because of it.
137100	141100	In fact, that was one of the reasons the pro-Gamergate people felt so betrayed during
141100	143060	that 2014 culture war.
143060	146660	The wider culture had demonized gamers for decades, using the same arguments that they
146660	148840	used on Rock and Roll and D&D.
148840	152580	Gamers expected their enthusiast press to stand up for them, as they had during previous
152580	153580	moral panics.
153580	157540	But now that it was the ethics of that enthusiast press themselves that was being called into
157540	159600	question, they turned on their own audiences.
159600	163180	Good faith questions from the gamers were replied to with accusations of sexism and
163180	167340	racism on the side of the journos, something that Anita Sarkeesian was a small part of.
167340	168340	Yeah, only a small part.
168340	171420	I know the narrative nowadays that she was the centerpiece, but really, having been a
171420	174060	part of it myself, Anita inserted herself for clout.
174060	175480	Nobody actually cared about her.
175480	179060	But the reason I'm going on this side tangent is because a lot of the time, when a free
179060	184180	speech advocate runs into speech they explicitly do not like, or sometimes, just after they've
184180	187040	gained power, suddenly, censorship seems like a good idea.
187040	191420	From hate speech is not free speech morons on the left to what offends me doesn't count
191420	195380	as free speech morons on the right, everyone is carving out their own little exceptions
195380	196380	to these rules.
196380	200300	Hell, some Muslims believe that the old blasphemy laws need to come back, at least for their
200300	201300	god.
201300	202300	Anyone else's existence.
202300	204180	And that's exactly what mockery is.
204180	208620	What the French have done, for example, has actually disrespected our beliefs and our
208620	212800	existence and therefore I don't think it can even be categorized as free speech.
212800	216820	Free speech can only be free speech as long as it respects other people.
216820	223980	If anyone is doing a mockery of a religion, of a prophet, do they deserve to pay the ultimate
223980	224980	price?
224980	227180	Do they deserve to die because of that?
227180	231660	That is a great question and that actually brings up another concept of death penalty
231660	235340	and I think that's a completely different question right now that you're asking, but
235340	239900	at the moment I think that we should focus on identifying as what they did was wrong
239900	243380	because a lot of people are saying, oh, you know, it's free speech, it's not mockery.
243380	246200	I think right now what we need to do is get to the root of the problem.
246200	247920	Mockery is not free speech.
247920	254080	What would you suggest as an appropriate penalty for the mockery of a religion or a prophet?
254080	256320	I wouldn't like to comment on this at this time.
256320	258600	And yeah, liberal society does this sort of thing too.
258600	260920	We have some concept of slander and defamation.
260920	264500	A narrow concept where it requires proving that the speaker knows what they're saying
264500	267400	is false and is only saying it to damage the target.
267400	269920	But nonetheless, it's still a restriction on speech.
269920	272920	Another restriction we accept are credible threats or credible incitement.
272920	275960	Credible, meaning that the speech will lead to violent action.
275960	279320	Believe it or not, though, one type of restriction that everyone thinks we have, but we actually
279320	283400	don't, is the whole shouting fire in a crowded theater thing that's actually allowed.
283400	287600	The point is, people who are on the margins of society tend to lean on free speech rights
287600	288880	because it benefits them.
288880	291880	Free speech is what allows them to spread the word of their unorthodox views.
291880	295560	But once the margin becomes the new core, or maybe not even that far, just gain some
295560	299440	position of stability or influence, suddenly free speech no longer benefits them, but it
299440	300440	hurts them.
300440	303320	Now the new margin can speak and undermine their new rule.
303680	306960	From a political realist's point of view, calling for free speech when you're losing
306960	311380	and calling for censorship along your rules when you're winning is the path to victory.
311380	313480	So is that what Jordan Peterson's doing?
313480	314480	I don't know.
314480	317080	But we can look at his previous stances on this topic.
317080	320440	After Peterson received pushback during his compelled speech controversy, there was a
320440	324060	chorus of voices condemning the loss of free speech in academia.
324060	327640	Especially since that's one of the most important places for free speech to be.
327640	330600	Academia is where you're supposed to get challenged, learn new ideas, discover new
330600	334600	things, through open inquiry, and to see a chilling effect hit the university was scary
334600	335600	indeed.
335600	338800	And that chilling effect began to spread far beyond just Jordan Peterson's own University
338800	339800	of Toronto.
339800	342560	The case of Lindsay Shepherd should be one that you all know, at least if you've been
342560	344200	watching my channel for the past few years.
344200	348080	Where, back in 2017, in her capacity as a teacher's assistant teaching a class, she
348080	351000	brought up Jordan Peterson in an academic context.
351000	353640	Shepherd was hauled in front of the head of her academic program, where it was claimed
353640	358400	that LGBTQ students had filed complaints against her for talking about Jordan Peterson in a
358400	362120	politically neutral manner, which had created a toxic climate for the students.
362120	366520	Because, just as you should not talk about, and I quote, Hitler or Milo Yiannopoulos in
366520	369600	a politically neutral way, the same goes for Jordan Peterson.
369600	377520	So just to give you some context about Jordan Peterson is, he is a figure that's basically
377520	380120	highly involved with the alt-right.
380120	390400	He lectures about basically critiquing feminism, critiquing trans rights, critiquing white
390400	391400	supremacy.
391400	392400	I follow him.
392400	393400	Or not critiquing you.
393400	396600	But the thing is, can you shield people from those ideas?
396600	401840	Am I supposed to comfort them and make sure that they are insulated away from this?
401840	404280	Like is that what the point of this is?
404280	407720	Because to me that is so against what a university is about.
407720	409440	I introduced it critically.
409880	412560	Like I said, it was in the spirit of debate.
412560	419160	Okay, in the spirit of the debate is slightly different than being like, okay this is a
419160	422160	problematic idea that we want to unpack.
422160	424520	But that's taking sides.
424520	428040	It's taking sides for me to be like, oh look at this guy, like everything that comes out
428040	431120	of his mouth is BS but we're going to watch anyway.
431120	436400	So I understand the position that you're coming from and your positionality, but the reality
436400	443400	is that it has created a toxic climate for some of the students.
443400	444400	How many?
444400	445400	It's great.
445400	446400	Who?
446400	447400	Like how many?
447400	448400	Okay.
448400	449400	One?
449400	450400	May I speak?
450400	454600	I have no concept of like how many people complained, like what their complaint was.
454600	456400	You haven't shown me the complaint.
456400	462840	Yes, I understand that this is upsetting, but there's also confidentiality matters.
462840	464480	The number of people is confidential?
464480	465480	Yes.
465560	469160	I don't see what's transphobic about showing a video of Jordan Peterson.
469160	470160	He's a real person.
470160	471760	He's out there.
471760	482400	He is a real person, but he is a real person who has engaged in targeted behavior or targeting
482400	484080	of trans students.
484080	490680	This is basically like neutrally playing a speech by Hitler or Milo Yiannopoulos from
490680	491680	gamergate.
491680	494800	Sheppard was threatened with disciplinary action if she didn't comply with the university's
494800	498760	demands, but an investigation later discovered that no complaint had actually been filed
498760	501840	by any student and she had not violated any school policy.
501840	506520	It turns out the entire thing was cooked up by her academic supervisor, Nathan Rambucana,
506520	508960	who had his own leftist political bias.
508960	511560	Lindsay Sheppard's censure is just one example of many.
511560	515120	How many times have people pulled fire alarms or called in bomb threats on speakers that
515120	519280	they didn't politically align with, generally right-leaning speakers and left-leaning protesters?
519280	523160	Again, as somebody who was a lefty before I grew up, that was wild for me to witness.
523160	525320	The left suddenly being against academic freedom.
525320	529800	It's at the point where, for example, UBC gave a questionnaire asking students about
529800	532720	the morality of Jordan Peterson's free speech stance.
532720	536060	And students overwhelmingly didn't trust that the school wouldn't punish them for
536060	538240	saying other than, I disagree.
538240	542600	So Jordan Peterson, until the tweet that we're talking about today, has pretty much universally
542600	547140	come down on the free speech side of things, even as a storm raged around him over his
547140	548540	commitment to that stance.
548540	551200	And he has faced some true ugliness for that commitment.
551200	555320	When he destroyed Kathy Newman in a debate back in 2018, he was considered a misogynist
555320	558440	for not just bending over and letting her have her way with him.
558440	561800	And Newman continued to play the victim card for years afterwards.
561800	565840	Countless no-names have called him an incel, a misogynist, a men's rights activist, a
565840	568200	fascist, a racist, a transphobe, whatever.
568200	571800	They took every single thing the left claims to hate and just tarred and feathered him
571800	573340	with it to see what would stick.
573340	577520	And when they finally found something they could actually hurt him with, namely his wife's
577520	581700	cancer diagnosis, her near-death experience, and his resulting drug addiction, they latched
581700	583620	onto that for all that it was fucking worth.
583620	588040	I am not surprised he came out of that experience a significantly more negative man than he
588040	589040	was before.
589040	591320	It's no secret that I once liked Jordan Peterson quite a lot.
591320	593220	His psychology takes are still top tier.
593220	597400	And most of what he says otherwise is useful, if a bit generic, self-help stuff.
597400	600840	But it's after the Elliot Page thing a few months back that I feel like he really began
600840	601840	to lose the plot.
601840	604600	I still listen to his old speeches occasionally too, they're quite good.
604600	607520	But he seems a lot more cynical now, a lot more cold to the world.
607520	610720	Which brings us back to his original tweet, his sudden reversal on free speech.
610720	611720	Only not exactly.
611720	614360	He's talking about being anonymous here, not free speech.
614360	618960	In 2021, I did a 30 minute video detailing the link between those two concepts.
618960	622500	I don't want to go over it entirely again or re-show all of the examples in that video
622500	627280	of various agents, both government and private, who are salivating at the opportunity to de-anonymize
627280	628660	people for political ends.
628660	630760	So I'd recommend you go check that one out if you're interested.
630760	635580	The TLDR is, we've known for a while that anonymous speech is required to speak truth
635580	636580	to power.
636580	639500	Power has its own ways of defending itself and promoting its interests.
639500	643400	While the common person is easily destroyed by power, anonymity is necessary for the common
643400	646920	person to have a voice, to be able to speak freely and criticize those in power.
646920	651540	Whenever those in power come for free speech, they start by coming for anonymous speech.
651540	655280	The first rule of the internet, when I was young, was don't tell people your real name
655280	656280	or address.
656280	658720	You don't know who's out there, you don't know who's saving your info.
658720	660480	Keep what is private, private.
660480	663240	That ethic was washed away by the popularity of social media.
663240	666720	The convenience and novelty of being able to find old classmates on Facebook or tweet
666720	669920	at your favorite celebs on Twitter outweighed any privacy concerns.
669920	674360	And while older people like me might grumble at the slow encroachment of these services
674360	677480	from having to provide Twitter with a phone number or having to show Facebook a photo
677480	681040	ID, we complied because everybody is on these centralized services.
681040	683860	And the Zoomers weren't even around to experience what it was like before.
683860	686880	To them, TikTok sending China all your data is just a normal thing.
686880	687980	Like why are you complaining?
687980	688980	Everyone does this.
688980	693380	Well, we're complaining because today's rampant cancel culture did not exist back
693380	694980	when anonymity was the default.
694980	698780	There are things that I've posted in my past that if they went viral, I would absolutely
698780	699780	be banned from everywhere.
699780	702840	I'm not even talking about the ICE tweet, that's not even close to how edgy 14 year
702840	704360	old dev was online.
704360	708700	People are getting destroyed as adults over shit they posted on Twitter as a child.
708700	712140	Stuff that wouldn't be out of place on Battle.net or Xbox Live back in the day.
712140	716020	When it happens to a leftoid like Sarah Jong or something, I laugh because they are the
716020	718400	people who wanted this to be the standard in the first place.
718400	720060	And now it's backfiring against them.
720060	722320	But it should not be the standard.
722320	726200	Most people who want to abolish anonymity, and this explicitly does not apply to Jordan
726200	728280	Peterson, desire it for ideological reasons.
728280	730840	It's not just getting canceled for old edgy tweets.
730840	736000	Look at how leftoids react when, for example, a 24 year old has consensual sex with a 36
736000	737000	year old.
737000	739240	Or a celebrity gets with a fangirl at a meetup after hours.
739240	742320	Or hell, an employee works for a boss at a normal ass job.
742320	744440	They're all screaming about power imbalances.
744440	749560	To the point that even if the people involved are totally fine and 100% consented to everything,
749560	752080	to them it's still an improper relationship.
752080	756160	To me, the natural response is, who the fuck are you to stick your nose into my business?
756160	760000	But the leftoids don't care about privacy as something to be valued.
760000	763200	You all know already, Mark's on the Jewish Question, where he dismantles the liberal right
763200	764200	of association.
764200	765960	We'll fast forward through that part of the video, I've talked about it a dozen
765960	766960	times already.
766960	770560	In the eyes of the left, it's private is not actually reason enough to leave it alone.
770560	774240	They reject the very concept of privacy because everything is political.
774240	775240	The personal is political.
775240	778880	And if it's political, then it's open to public inquiry because that's what politics
778880	779880	is.
779880	780880	The domain of the public.
780880	782520	I will always oppose this logic.
782520	787360	Hell, in Canada, the liberal argument for gay rights is explicitly an argument of privacy.
787360	790760	Where Prime Minister Trudeau, not the current one, his father, famously said, the state
790760	792920	has no place in the bedrooms of the nation.
792920	796800	To reject privacy rights is to say that the state actually does have a place in the bedrooms
796800	797800	of the nation.
797800	798920	And that's something that I can't abide by.
798920	801800	Abolishing the anonymous is only one such push.
801800	803040	Digital ID is a second one.
803040	806280	Obviously, you should have an ID if you're going to go vote, but the vote you tally is
806280	807280	still a secret one.
807280	810880	You still do it in private because you recognize the intimidation factor of having someone
810880	812680	look over your shoulder while you cast your ballot.
812680	815280	But nonetheless, we've seen a lot of strange ID takes.
815280	819040	During COVID, it was all about vaccine passports, not a vaccine card that you have to show once
819040	822820	to sign up for school, but a pass on your phone that you must keep on you at all times
822820	826600	and have it scanned at any place that you go to outside of your house and in some places
826600	829920	show it to the cops on demand, even as you just walk around town.
829920	834860	And that is slowly morphing into a more generalized digital ID kept on your phone at all times,
834860	836400	tracking your locations and activities.
836400	840100	I know this sounds like Alex Jones type stuff, and it's not happening yet, but there are
840100	842760	absolutely fringe elements pushing for this sort of thing.
842760	847040	And in general, we are slowly moving closer to a more surveillance heavy world.
847040	850600	The push for digital money is cut from the same cloth where some places are looking into
850600	854840	abolishing cash entirely in order to more easily track people's purchases.
854840	858200	China's even experimented with digital money that has a time limit that you've got to spend
858200	861400	or else it vanishes in order to prevent people from saving up resources.
861400	864320	And of course, there's that oft talked about WEF article.
864320	865320	It's 2030.
865320	866320	I own nothing.
866320	868040	I have no privacy and life has never been better.
868040	872120	You know, if Klaus Schwab didn't want people to think he was some insane wannabe dictator
872120	876520	looking to consolidate the entire planet under a new world order through mass impoverishment
876520	880100	and collectivization of everyone and everything, he probably shouldn't have dreamed that something
880100	882180	as insane sounding as this.
882180	885640	And by the way, this isn't just some WEF brain conspiracy.
885640	891020	In the UK, the Criminal Finances Act of 2017 introduced the Unexplained Wealth Order, which
891020	896080	allows for the confiscation of property without proving any law was broken by reversing that
896080	897220	burden of proof.
897220	900320	If you can't prove that you made your money in a way that the government approves of,
900320	901320	they will take it from you.
901320	905400	And one province in Canada, British Columbia, has recently stated they intend to introduce
905400	906520	a similar program.
906520	911080	In both cases, they claim it'll only be used to seize the capital gained by organized crime.
911080	915420	But it's not hard to see how just such an apparatus can be turned on any citizen should
915420	918380	the government suddenly decree that normal behavior is criminal.
918380	922780	And again, during COVID, we saw a lot of normal behavior become criminal.
922780	927140	All of this stuff flies in the face of privacy, of anonymity, of the right to disconnect from
927140	930660	the rest of society and enjoy a private, personal life.
930660	933800	The truth is, anonymity is both good and necessary.
933800	935220	We already know too much about each other.
935220	938540	The phrase, good fences make good neighbors, is known for a reason.
938540	942620	I don't buy any of this if you have nothing to fear, then you have nothing to hide nonsense.
942620	946460	And I'm honestly surprised that Jordan Peterson is arriving at the anti-anonymous point.
946460	954780	Here Jordan, let me describe the fatal flaw of your position in your own words.
954780	957860	At the same time, I also recognize the flip side of the argument.
957860	962220	It certainly seems ridiculous to me that anonymous trolls and haters can compile information
962220	966500	on me that, while no reasonable person would see that it's bad, could be presented in such
966500	971020	a light by a bad faith actor only for the purposes of hurting me, all behind the safety
971020	972020	of anonymity.
972420	976740	That is what the supposedly compassionate, harm-reduction focused leftoids did to Jordan
976740	978660	Peterson when they were shitting on him for his addiction.
978660	983040	It's what happened to Sargon, where people keep spreading around the UKIP rape man thing
983040	986940	and the depends on the child thing, which is literally just him steelmanning Amos Yee's
986940	988300	position while debating him.
988300	993140	It can seem exceptionally cruel when anonymous actors can move to destroy you over nothing
993140	996140	using outright lies and you can't do anything about it.
996140	999960	It's like I said at the beginning of the video, a cry of free speech is the cry of the oppressed,
999960	1000960	the outsider.
1001000	1004400	The establishment doesn't really need free speech, and this is why a lot of people are
1004400	1008920	free speech extremists when on the fringe and suddenly become a lot more censorious
1008920	1010520	after their station has been razed.
1010520	1014400	Hell, you can even make the argument that I've done this, in some extreme circumstances.
1014400	1018960	For example, while I am still very pro-free speech, and I absolutely do tolerate criticism
1018960	1023480	and mockery of me, I had to purge my Discord of a bunch of retards after Discord sent me
1023480	1028320	an email saying that people had been organizing raids out of my server against other communities.
1028320	1032760	And after I began to investigate some of the side, lesser-used channels on my server,
1032760	1036280	I discovered a group of people who didn't actually watch my content at all.
1036280	1039720	They didn't actually give a shit about me or my community, they actively chased away
1039720	1044400	new fans for fun, they posted stuff that was blatantly against Discord TOS, and they were
1044400	1048780	simply using my server as a way to plan out harassment against other servers because they
1048780	1053480	heard I was a free speech guy, and so therefore they expected I wouldn't come down on them.
1053480	1057440	So I nuked them all into oblivion, and now they sit on a side server crying that I'm
1057440	1059060	actually not pro-free speech at all.
1059060	1062400	The point is, you can have good ideals, but they're always going to be challenged when
1062400	1064880	those ideals impact the real world.
1064880	1068480	Eventually, some ridiculous edge case will cause you to go against your ethics.
1068480	1072480	But at the same time, we also know, from the French Revolution, from the Russian Revolution,
1072480	1076020	from countless other examples, that if you step outside of the bounds of ethics every
1076020	1079460	time there's a seemingly good reason to, it's not going to end well for you.
1079460	1081900	So what does that leave us with in regards to Jordan Peterson?
1081900	1084160	I understand his desire here, but I must disagree.
1084160	1088480	Hell, even old Jordan Peterson must disagree, considering the extent to which he himself
1088480	1090000	has written about the virtues of privacy.
1090000	1095360	I'm not directly comparing removing anonymous online accounts to the Chinese surveillance
1095360	1098760	state, with social credit and expiring money, and a phone which tracks you and tells you
1098760	1101360	to report to a government facility if you post the wrong opinions online.
1101360	1103160	Yes, that's actually happening in China right now.
1103160	1105880	It's what they turned their COVID tracking apparatus into.
1105880	1110400	What I'm saying is, there is a real slippery slope here, and unlike a lot of other slippery
1110400	1113440	slopes that people talk about, this one's actually possible.
1113440	1116800	And there's a lot of people here, now, who want to make it happen.
1116800	1119420	Therefore, I'm not willing to give an inch on this issue.
1119420	1122200	Being anonymous is a necessary component of a free society.
1122200	1126400	And if it means that public figures, including myself, occasionally get made a fool of, then
1126400	1130040	that is a price worth paying.
1130040	1131360	Hey there, GigaChads.
1131360	1135800	If you're watching this on release day, that's December 8th, 2022.
1135800	1139680	Come back to the channel tonight, at 7.30 PM EST.
1139680	1143800	That's 4.30 for the West Coast, and uh, 12.30 in the UK.

1145400	1150960	Because tonight is the night of the 2022 Video Game Awards, and I'm gonna be streaming them.
1150960	1155480	Get your Mountain Dew and Doritos ready, because, yeah, come on, we're all losers here.
1155480	1156840	And let's watch it together.
1156840	1159200	This YouTube channel tonight, or my Twitch channel?
1159200	1160200	Either or.
1160200	1161200	I'll see you there.
1161200	1161400	I love you.
