00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Hello everyone, welcome to TikTok Thursday!

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,960
Yes, I know, I missed it on Tuesday.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,040
I'm real sorry.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,200
I was actually doing work, real work.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,960
You did at least see yesterday's video.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,840
Things are being made, it's just had to push it ahead.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,760
It's not gonna be TikTok Thursday consistently.

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,360
You'll have Tuesday again next week.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,340
Let's get started.

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,620
You guys a couple?

11
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,520
Oh, this one's very produced.

12
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,960
What's one thing you dislike about each other?

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,800
Um.

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,960
I hate that she sells feet pics.

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,320
I've literally made so much money.

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,800
I bought this Prada bag,

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,640
and I bought him a Macbook last week.

18
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,480
Oh Jesus, that's a lot of money.

19
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,760
Oh, fun with feet.

20
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,160
What's one thing you dislike about him then?

21
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,080
That he doesn't make as much money as me.

22
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,160
She's right about that.

23
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,000
Wow.

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,880
Well, what do you expect, lady?

25
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,520
You want him to start selling feet pics or something?

26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,900
Man, I don't get it.

27
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,080
What the hell's with the feet pics?

28
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,120
What the hell's with feet?

29
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,360
Why do people like feet?

30
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,880
Why is that becoming like a normalized fetish?

31
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,220
I hate the modern world.

32
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,060
Oh my God.

33
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,800
Oh, this is a TV show, I guess.

34
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,280
Damn.

35
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,420
Wonder what show it is.

36
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,780
Why is this in the, why'd you guys send me this?

37
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,340
There's been a shooting.

38
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,300
Looks like a show my dad would watch.

39
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,980
So, you've had quite a day.

40
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,820
Damn.

41
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,640
I bet you when you woke up-

42
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,480
Look at this guy.

43
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,900
You wouldn't even end up here.

44
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,180
Does that feminoid have to be-

45
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,020
Ha ha ha ha.

46
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,240
Excuse me?

47
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,080
Feminoid.

48
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,920
Foid.

49
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,740
Foid.

50
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,580
Foid.

51
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,980
Oh my God, this is like an incel episode?

52
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,180
And you don't get to decide who's in this one or who isn't.

53
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,020
Fimoidcel.

54
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,180
Why don't you tell me what happened this morning?

55
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,060
That's Stacey got what she deserves.

56
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,980
Stacey?

57
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,780
Oh my God.

58
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,500
It is an incel episode.

59
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,700
Whenever they want it.

60
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,460
But no matter what I do, they deny me.

61
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,500
This poor, nice guy.

62
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,560
I deserve love.

63
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,340
What the fuck?

64
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,620
But they won't give it to me.

65
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,180
They only give it to those shallow, stupid alphas.

66
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,060
Oh no guys, the alphas.

67
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,060
I'm 28 years old and I'm still a virgin.

68
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,140
Like this is a good looking dude.

69
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,980
This is the wrong guy to hire for this.

70
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,820
I will slaughter them.

71
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,660
Hollywood.

72
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,720
I am the true alpha male and I will make them pay.

73
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,980
You gotta be a sigma.

74
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,380
Man, I don't know why they had to play

75
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,380
multiple music tracks during that thing.

76
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,720
That was fucking annoying.

77
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,780
But holy shit.

78
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,740
I love it when these weird online sub communities

79
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,060
filter down into the normie TV shows.

80
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,820
This happened way back in the day with Furries and CSI.

81
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,740
And then it happened during Gamergate.

82
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,620
There was the Gamergate episode of, man what was it?

83
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,540
Was it NCIS?

84
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,460
It was some kind of crime drama.

85
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,020
You know, the shows that only boomers watch.

86
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,180
And now we have the incel episode.

87
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,980
Add it to the list of classics.

88
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,140
Oh my God, I have to censor this.

89
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,160
She's naked.

90
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,040
This is a naked, morbidly obese black woman

91
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,300
with like five rolls.

92
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,980
It's like two little twigs

93
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,860
and then like just a big ball of rolls.

94
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,260
And she's ripping apart cakes at a grocery store.

95
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,260
I gotta censor this one.

96
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,340
She's rubbing it all over her rolls.

97
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,300
What the fuck?

98
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,640
What am I watching?

99
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,720
Is anybody gonna stop her?

100
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,300
You have security, right?

101
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,380
I mean, I know I wouldn't wanna go anywhere near

102
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,980
that hot fucking mess, but like surely the cops,

103
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,340
security, someone.

104
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,260
Oh my God, the way that like it moves her stomach

105
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,220
just Jesus.

106
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,420
Was it?

107
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,880
It looks like I'm looking at fucking jab of the huts face.

108
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,220
Like as it's trying to talk.

109
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,580
Oh man, why is there icing right in her ass?

110
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,020
Does she like sit on a cake?

111
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,060
Oh my God, she broke a bunch of beer too.

112
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,660
All that glass and she's walking around with no clothes.

113
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,120
She's just trashing the whole store.

114
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,960
Like what the fuck?

115
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,780
You have to stop her eventually.

116
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,440
You can't just let her carry on.

117
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,500
What the, how do you just let them do this guys?

118
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
I called Mohammed, oh my God.

119
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,220
Someone's coming apparently.

120
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh my God, she's going behind.

121
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,500
She's going behind the desk.

122
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,400
And now the employees like help.

123
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,420
We can't touch her.

124
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,540
The police are coming.

125
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,820
Oh, she's shampooing in the, oh my God.

126
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,780
She was shampooing in the icing.

127
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,100
Yep, she's just rubbing herself and everything back there.

128
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,900
I'm like, this is a five minute video.

129
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,960
I'm still watching it guys.

130
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,920
I'm just, I'm stunned.

131
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,540
I feel like I'm watching a David Lynch fever dream here.

132
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,620
Oh God, she's rubbing the cake

133
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,660
like underneath her fat flaps.

134
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,220
She's out from behind the counter.

135
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,140
Now she's just destroying more stuff.

136
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,580
Oh shit, she's rubbing that whole cake into her vagina.

137
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,300
Jesus, what the fuck?

138
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,980
Oh, she's in the bread section now.

139
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,860
Shoving the bread in her ass.

140
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,740
Yes, I'm going to cut a whole bunch of that out

141
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,860
because I was just like watching in silence.

142
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,820
And early is just more of the same, but holy fuck.

143
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,240
Holy shit, guys.

144
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,500
You ever feel that urge to just strip down

145
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,480
in the grocery store and then destroy the entire place

146
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,500
with your genitals?

147
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,700
I don't know if like that was a psychotic break

148
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,380
or if she's just an asshole,

149
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,020
or maybe like this is one of those ploys

150
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,420
where she wants to get arrested.

151
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,340
So she's like perfectly of sound mind.

152
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,420
She just, she wants to go back in the slammer.

153
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,920
So she just does this casually.

154
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,660
But damn, before she destroyed like all that shit,

155
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,220
she really should have just been thrown out.

156
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,180
I know it's illegal, but it shouldn't be.

157
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,020
Uplifters.

158
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,980
One of them even took the time to explain

159
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,820
more shoplifting didn't pay.

160
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,980
Yep, that's how it is.

161
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,740
Hit anywhere between 15 to 20 times a day.

162
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,940
Out of frustration a week and a half ago,

163
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,140
they decided to chain up their freezer section.

164
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,980
Oh my God.

165
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,740
This is one of the hardest hit areas in their store.

166
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,020
Now, when you want something.

167
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,900
Get the fuck out of California, guys.

168
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,420
Message goes off on the overhead speaker

169
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,860
and an employee comes to unlock the freezer.

170
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,620
Shoplifters have tried to burn the cases.

171
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,580
There's been four shoplifters in a couple of hours.

172
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,300
He was working at the store today.

173
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,260
So basically stealing out of this store.

174
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,020
He did not want his face on camera,

175
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,340
but said he detained eight people shoplifting yesterday.

176
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,180
People were-

177
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,500
They just don't give a shit anymore, guys.

178
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,980
So outside, if they cross the threshold,

179
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,260
they can be put under arrest.

180
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,500
The eight people that I took on yesterday,

181
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,300
seven of them returned the items.

182
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,860
It's a store didn't wish to put a citizen's arrest on.

183
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,780
What the fuck?

184
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,700
Yeah, man, California is literally

185
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,900
just sinking into the fucking ocean.

186
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,060
If you have a society where theft is permissible

187
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,360
because lives are more important than property

188
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,380
or whatever the fuck, this is what you get.

189
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,340
Extremely low trust society.

190
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,340
If you're an actual like legitimate shopper,

191
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,380
you're shopping in hell

192
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,060
because everything's fucking locked up.

193
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,700
And eventually these stores will just close.

194
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,140
I saw something recently that like Walmart's

195
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,560
are pulling out of Portland, I think.

196
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,220
That'll be part of a future video.

197
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,760
You can't expect these corporations

198
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,480
just keep taking losses forever.

199
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,280
Eventually they will just leave.

200
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,080
Oh, I think this next one's a self-help guy.

201
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,920
Let's see.

202
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,440
What if I told you there was a way to buy things

203
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,220
like this $100,000 watch

204
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,560
without spending a single dollar of your own money

205
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,300
using business credit like this

206
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,040
that you never actually had to pay back.

207
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,880
Let's hear about it.

208
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,300
To the average person, guys, this sounds crazy,

209
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,520
but any business owner knows how this works.

210
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,920
I don't know how personal credit works.

211
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,560
Let's say for example,

212
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,480
you will get a car or credit card in your personal name.

213
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,440
You're personally held responsible for that.

214
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,720
So if you were to go get a credit card

215
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,880
in your personal name

216
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,680
and you were to go max the card out,

217
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,640
you're going to be held liable.

218
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,680
And if you don't make that payment back,

219
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,280
the bank could come and sue you.

220
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,560
What makes us different about business credit

221
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,680
with business credit,

222
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,000
you are not personally held responsible

223
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,280
for that line of credit.

224
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,100
So let's say for example, how I got this watch,

225
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,240
I was able to open a business

226
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,880
that I didn't really give a shit about.

227
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,560
I went and opened business credit cards in that account.

228
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,840
I then proceeded to go on, buy this $400,000.

229
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,180
I'm going to turn around and sell it to a jeweler

230
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,040
for $80,000 in cash, which now gives me the cash.

231
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,160
I'll file bankruptcy on the company.

232
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,680
I'll never have to actually pay it back

233
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,600
because I'm not personally liable

234
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,080
for that American Express card.

235
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,600
It's all liable underneath my business.

236
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,440
Dude.

237
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,260
It's weird to explain it in one video,

238
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,120
but guys, if you're interested in getting involved in this

239
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,200
and you could use some extra information.

240
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,400
No, I'm not, sir.

241
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,840
I want you to go to Instagram.

242
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,840
No, no, do not.

243
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,360
Okay, I like how he just openly admits to fraud on TikTok.

244
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
This is where we are?

245
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,880
I know like on the weekly sip and previous sips,

246
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,580
I've talked about how like criminals

247
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,680
who have murdered or something,

248
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,280
they like taunt the cops on Facebook and then get caught.

249
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,600
Like it's fucking stupid.

250
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,920
You now got people out here just admitting fraud on TikTok.

251
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,560
Be like, yeah, this is how you do it, dudes.

252
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,920
This is the secret, guys.

253
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,960
Here's how you get yourself a $100,000 watch, guys.

254
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,720
And wait a minute, wait a minute.

255
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,320
Get yourself a $100,000 watch.

256
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,140
He bought the watch,

257
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,960
then returned it and got $80,000 in cash.

258
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,960
And then he filed for bankruptcy on the company.

259
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,120
But if you return the watch for cash,

260
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,360
how do you still have the watch?

261
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,180
Hold on, fuck.

262
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,780
Even his scummy ass ideas don't fucking sound right.

263
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,620
Hold on.

264
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,000
Things like this $100,000 watch.

265
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,840
Yeah, there's the watch.

266
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,560
Without spending a single dollar of your own money

267
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,960
using business credit like this.

268
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,800
Business credit, okay.

269
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,760
That you never actually had to pay back.

270
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
How I got this watch.

271
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,600
How'd you get it?

272
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,420
I was able to open a business

273
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,560
that I didn't really give a shit about.

274
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,240
Buy this for $100,000.

275
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,540
I'm gonna turn around and sell it to a jeweler

276
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,400
for $80,000 in cash, which now gives me the cash.

277
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,520
I'll file bankruptcy on the company.

278
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,160
I'll never have to actually pay it back.

279
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,920
But how do you get the watch though, dude?

280
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,280
You sell the watch back for $80,000.

281
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,100
That gets you money.

282
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,940
But how do you get the watch?

283
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,680
You just do it again and then eventually buy the watch cash?

284
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,520
I don't know, man.

285
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,200
I just personally think admitting to your fraud on TikTok

286
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,800
is not the greatest idea.

287
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,960
Actually, let's see if his TikTok's still around.

288
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,700
Green thumb.

289
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,720
Let's see here.

290
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,360
Yep, his main account had 114,000 likes, 8,000 followers.

291
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,200
Wanna work together?

292
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,780
DM me, yeah, so he can swindle you.

293
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,680
Good idea.

294
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,360
Oh, and I found his link tree.

295
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,200
Let's see.

296
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Join the Drop Ship Academy.

297
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,120
Oh God, drop shipping.

298
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,400
It's one of those fucking scammers.

299
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,540
I'm gonna have to do a video

300
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,360
on the drop shipping nonsense at some point.

301
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,740
It's fucking, I don't know if you guys know

302
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,540
about this particular internet subculture,

303
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,480
but it's really ridiculous and stupid.

304
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,120
But it seems like this guy like just

305
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,280
either got banned off TikTok

306
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,800
or deleted his account or something.

307
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,640
And I'm not surprised because Jesus Christ.

308
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,440
Oh, it's the British cops this time.

309
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,820
He just lightly jogs away.

310
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,140
The two cops can't stop, wow.

311
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,720
British cops are like, they're a fucking joke.

312
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,180
They're a fucking joke.

313
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,400
To be fair, considering the absurd laws

314
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,360
they have to enforce, it's kind of good

315
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,200
that they are a joke, but God damn.

316
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,120
When you see British police trying to actually,

317
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,800
you know, enforce a law on somebody,

318
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,120
it's like, nah, I don't got to deal with this.

319
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
And they can do it.

320
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,360
There's no threat there.

321
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,920
Yo dude, look at them titties.

322
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,440
Oh man, it looks like that teacher

323
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,080
with the ridiculously giant tits

324
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,640
from the high school, the Canadian high school.

325
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,800
They did a video on them back a few months ago.

326
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,240
But holy shit, I guess this is what we're allowing now.

327
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,080
Why not?

328
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,160
Walk around with giant boobs, fuck it.

329
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,140
If anyone complains, call them a bigot.

330
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,640
If you are not black, if your skin is not brown,

331
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,320
if you are not melanated, then you do not have the right

332
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,800
to come under my videos talking about my law.

333
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,680
And now we have an actual racist here.

334
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,720
Your opinions are not wanted, nor are they relevant.

335
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
So why do you feel like you need to come

336
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,320
and keep saying something to my people?

337
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,760
You need to ask me my permission before you speak

338
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,280
or comment on my videos.

339
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,920
You come under my video and say, Lord,

340
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,920
may I please have your permission to say something.

341
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,400
Then you wait for me to give you my permission

342
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,040
before you start tapping, moving your little pasty fingers

343
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,400
around my age.

344
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,000
You people have been talking way too much

345
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,880
for way too long, and your time is officially up.

346
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,000
It is black power forever.

347
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,760
What a legitimately hateful person,

348
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,080
like deep down in their soul.

349
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,720
I would hate to live my life like this person, my God.

350
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,520
Her TikTok is the Black Messiah.

351
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,000
All right, I guess that's where we are now.

352
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,160
Let's see real quick.

353
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,880
Wait, her account is gone too.

354
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,720
These people just keep nuking their accounts

355
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,280
every time they go viral with a dog shit fucking take

356
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,960
or like a dumb short.

357
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,840
Like what the fuck?

358
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,640
Good riddance, I guess, but damn,

359
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,080
I was hoping to find more spicy stuff.

360
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,920
The conception that lesbian means a woman

361
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,120
who loves other women.

362
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,960
Doesn't it?

363
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,320
And actually the definition is non-men

364
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,360
who are attracted to and love other non-men.

365
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,840
Throughout history, there have always been

366
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,320
gender nonconforming lesbians.

367
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,280
And it's interesting to see nowadays

368
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,080
that there are some folks who kind of try to gatekeep

369
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,280
that identity. Oh my fucking.

370
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,520
And only include folks who identify as women.

371
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,560
They're claiming butch women as trans.

372
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,880
There are trans men who identified as a lesbian

373
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,640
for many, many years and still feel comfortable

374
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,800
within that community and that identity.

375
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,600
There are non-binary folks of all kinds

376
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,080
who identify as lesbians.

377
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,000
This is stupid.

378
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,520
There's like a zillion different ways to be a lesbian.

379
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,880
And if that word is what's comfortable for you,

380
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,800
then nobody can gatekeep it from you.

381
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,360
I am non-binary, trans masculine, and I'm a lesbian.

382
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,200
So true.

383
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,880
I guess I'm a lesbian now too.

384
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,720
Why not?

385
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,680
This was a joke back when I was in high school.

386
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,640
It would always be that one smart ass kid

387
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,600
who would come up and say,

388
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,320
well, lesbians are people who like women, right?

389
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,640
So as a guy, you're a lesbian

390
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,400
because I'm a person who likes women.

391
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,680
And it's like, ha ha, I get it.

392
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,600
You're being retarded.

393
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,000
Now they're doing something like this unironically.

394
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,840
So fine.

395
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,440
I feel comfortable with this identity.

396
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,840
So now I'm a lesbian.

397
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,900
And if you complain, you're a bigot.

398
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,800
All right guys, I can't take any more brain rot.

399
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,620
I'm fucking off.

400
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,480
I'll see you tomorrow for another video.

401
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,040
I'll see you tonight for another stream.

402
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Make sure that you're there.

403
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,120
And thanks very much.

404
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,200
Have a good one.

405
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,040
I love you.
