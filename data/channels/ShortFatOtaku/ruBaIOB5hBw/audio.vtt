00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
Hello everyone, welcome to TikTok Thursday!

00:02.720 --> 00:05.960
Yes, I know, I missed it on Tuesday.

00:05.960 --> 00:07.040
I'm real sorry.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.200
I was actually doing work, real work.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.960
You did at least see yesterday's video.

00:10.960 --> 00:13.840
Things are being made, it's just had to push it ahead.

00:13.840 --> 00:16.760
It's not gonna be TikTok Thursday consistently.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.360
You'll have Tuesday again next week.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.340
Let's get started.

00:20.340 --> 00:21.620
You guys a couple?

00:21.620 --> 00:22.520
Oh, this one's very produced.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.960
What's one thing you dislike about each other?

00:24.960 --> 00:25.800
Um.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.960
I hate that she sells feet pics.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.320
I've literally made so much money.

00:30.320 --> 00:31.800
I bought this Prada bag,

00:31.800 --> 00:33.640
and I bought him a Macbook last week.

00:33.640 --> 00:35.480
Oh Jesus, that's a lot of money.

00:35.480 --> 00:36.760
Oh, fun with feet.

00:36.760 --> 00:39.160
What's one thing you dislike about him then?

00:39.160 --> 00:42.080
That he doesn't make as much money as me.

00:42.080 --> 00:43.160
She's right about that.

00:43.160 --> 00:44.000
Wow.

00:44.000 --> 00:44.880
Well, what do you expect, lady?

00:44.880 --> 00:47.520
You want him to start selling feet pics or something?

00:47.520 --> 00:48.900
Man, I don't get it.

00:48.900 --> 00:50.080
What the hell's with the feet pics?

00:50.080 --> 00:51.120
What the hell's with feet?

00:51.120 --> 00:52.360
Why do people like feet?

00:52.360 --> 00:54.880
Why is that becoming like a normalized fetish?

00:54.880 --> 00:56.220
I hate the modern world.

00:57.220 --> 00:58.060
Oh my God.

01:00.020 --> 01:01.800
Oh, this is a TV show, I guess.

01:03.780 --> 01:05.280
Damn.

01:05.280 --> 01:06.420
Wonder what show it is.

01:06.420 --> 01:08.780
Why is this in the, why'd you guys send me this?

01:08.780 --> 01:10.340
There's been a shooting.

01:10.340 --> 01:12.300
Looks like a show my dad would watch.

01:13.300 --> 01:14.980
So, you've had quite a day.

01:14.980 --> 01:15.820
Damn.

01:15.820 --> 01:16.640
I bet you when you woke up-

01:16.640 --> 01:17.480
Look at this guy.

01:17.480 --> 01:18.900
You wouldn't even end up here.

01:18.900 --> 01:20.180
Does that feminoid have to be-

01:20.180 --> 01:21.020
Ha ha ha ha.

01:21.020 --> 01:22.240
Excuse me?

01:22.240 --> 01:23.080
Feminoid.

01:23.080 --> 01:23.920
Foid.

01:23.920 --> 01:24.740
Foid.

01:24.740 --> 01:25.580
Foid.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.980
Oh my God, this is like an incel episode?

01:28.980 --> 01:32.180
And you don't get to decide who's in this one or who isn't.

01:32.180 --> 01:33.020
Fimoidcel.

01:34.660 --> 01:37.180
Why don't you tell me what happened this morning?

01:37.180 --> 01:39.060
That's Stacey got what she deserves.

01:39.060 --> 01:39.980
Stacey?

01:41.580 --> 01:42.780
Oh my God.

01:42.780 --> 01:44.500
It is an incel episode.

01:44.500 --> 01:45.700
Whenever they want it.

01:45.700 --> 01:49.460
But no matter what I do, they deny me.

01:49.460 --> 01:50.500
This poor, nice guy.

01:50.500 --> 01:51.560
I deserve love.

01:52.500 --> 01:53.340
What the fuck?

01:53.340 --> 01:54.620
But they won't give it to me.

01:55.380 --> 01:58.180
They only give it to those shallow, stupid alphas.

01:58.180 --> 02:00.060
Oh no guys, the alphas.

02:00.060 --> 02:03.060
I'm 28 years old and I'm still a virgin.

02:03.060 --> 02:04.140
Like this is a good looking dude.

02:04.140 --> 02:05.980
This is the wrong guy to hire for this.

02:05.980 --> 02:06.820
I will slaughter them.

02:06.820 --> 02:07.660
Hollywood.

02:07.660 --> 02:11.720
I am the true alpha male and I will make them pay.

02:11.720 --> 02:12.980
You gotta be a sigma.

02:12.980 --> 02:14.380
Man, I don't know why they had to play

02:14.380 --> 02:16.380
multiple music tracks during that thing.

02:16.380 --> 02:17.720
That was fucking annoying.

02:17.720 --> 02:18.780
But holy shit.

02:18.780 --> 02:21.740
I love it when these weird online sub communities

02:21.740 --> 02:24.060
filter down into the normie TV shows.

02:24.060 --> 02:27.820
This happened way back in the day with Furries and CSI.

02:27.820 --> 02:29.740
And then it happened during Gamergate.

02:29.740 --> 02:32.620
There was the Gamergate episode of, man what was it?

02:32.620 --> 02:33.540
Was it NCIS?

02:33.540 --> 02:35.460
It was some kind of crime drama.

02:35.460 --> 02:38.020
You know, the shows that only boomers watch.

02:38.020 --> 02:40.180
And now we have the incel episode.

02:40.180 --> 02:41.980
Add it to the list of classics.

02:41.980 --> 02:43.140
Oh my God, I have to censor this.

02:43.140 --> 02:44.160
She's naked.

02:45.280 --> 02:49.040
This is a naked, morbidly obese black woman

02:49.040 --> 02:51.300
with like five rolls.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.980
It's like two little twigs

02:52.980 --> 02:55.860
and then like just a big ball of rolls.

02:55.860 --> 02:58.260
And she's ripping apart cakes at a grocery store.

02:58.260 --> 03:00.260
I gotta censor this one.

03:00.260 --> 03:02.340
She's rubbing it all over her rolls.

03:02.340 --> 03:03.300
What the fuck?

03:03.300 --> 03:04.640
What am I watching?

03:07.100 --> 03:08.720
Is anybody gonna stop her?

03:09.860 --> 03:11.300
You have security, right?

03:13.180 --> 03:15.380
I mean, I know I wouldn't wanna go anywhere near

03:15.380 --> 03:19.980
that hot fucking mess, but like surely the cops,

03:19.980 --> 03:21.340
security, someone.

03:22.340 --> 03:25.260
Oh my God, the way that like it moves her stomach

03:25.260 --> 03:27.220
just Jesus.

03:28.580 --> 03:29.420
Was it?

03:29.420 --> 03:31.880
It looks like I'm looking at fucking jab of the huts face.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.220
Like as it's trying to talk.

03:33.220 --> 03:35.580
Oh man, why is there icing right in her ass?

03:35.580 --> 03:37.020
Does she like sit on a cake?

03:37.020 --> 03:40.060
Oh my God, she broke a bunch of beer too.

03:40.060 --> 03:42.660
All that glass and she's walking around with no clothes.

03:42.660 --> 03:46.120
She's just trashing the whole store.

03:46.120 --> 03:46.960
Like what the fuck?

03:46.960 --> 03:47.780
You have to stop her eventually.

03:47.780 --> 03:49.440
You can't just let her carry on.

03:52.340 --> 03:56.500
What the, how do you just let them do this guys?

04:02.820 --> 04:04.820
I called Mohammed, oh my God.

04:04.820 --> 04:06.220
Someone's coming apparently.

04:09.380 --> 04:11.000
Oh my God, she's going behind.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.500
She's going behind the desk.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.400
And now the employees like help.

04:17.400 --> 04:18.420
We can't touch her.

04:18.420 --> 04:19.540
The police are coming.

04:20.540 --> 04:23.820
Oh, she's shampooing in the, oh my God.

04:26.020 --> 04:27.780
She was shampooing in the icing.

04:28.980 --> 04:32.100
Yep, she's just rubbing herself and everything back there.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.900
I'm like, this is a five minute video.

04:35.900 --> 04:36.960
I'm still watching it guys.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.920
I'm just, I'm stunned.

04:41.900 --> 04:45.540
I feel like I'm watching a David Lynch fever dream here.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.620
Oh God, she's rubbing the cake

04:47.620 --> 04:49.660
like underneath her fat flaps.

04:54.860 --> 04:56.220
She's out from behind the counter.

04:56.220 --> 04:58.140
Now she's just destroying more stuff.

05:00.740 --> 05:03.580
Oh shit, she's rubbing that whole cake into her vagina.

05:03.580 --> 05:07.300
Jesus, what the fuck?

05:08.600 --> 05:10.980
Oh, she's in the bread section now.

05:10.980 --> 05:12.860
Shoving the bread in her ass.

05:12.860 --> 05:14.740
Yes, I'm going to cut a whole bunch of that out

05:14.740 --> 05:16.860
because I was just like watching in silence.

05:16.860 --> 05:19.820
And early is just more of the same, but holy fuck.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.240
Holy shit, guys.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.500
You ever feel that urge to just strip down

05:24.500 --> 05:27.480
in the grocery store and then destroy the entire place

05:27.480 --> 05:28.500
with your genitals?

05:28.500 --> 05:31.700
I don't know if like that was a psychotic break

05:31.700 --> 05:33.380
or if she's just an asshole,

05:33.380 --> 05:35.020
or maybe like this is one of those ploys

05:35.020 --> 05:36.420
where she wants to get arrested.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.340
So she's like perfectly of sound mind.

05:38.340 --> 05:40.420
She just, she wants to go back in the slammer.

05:40.420 --> 05:41.920
So she just does this casually.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.660
But damn, before she destroyed like all that shit,

05:44.660 --> 05:46.220
she really should have just been thrown out.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.180
I know it's illegal, but it shouldn't be.

05:48.180 --> 05:50.020
Uplifters.

05:50.020 --> 05:51.980
One of them even took the time to explain

05:51.980 --> 05:53.820
more shoplifting didn't pay.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.980
Yep, that's how it is.

05:57.980 --> 06:01.740
Hit anywhere between 15 to 20 times a day.

06:01.740 --> 06:03.940
Out of frustration a week and a half ago,

06:03.940 --> 06:06.140
they decided to chain up their freezer section.

06:06.140 --> 06:06.980
Oh my God.

06:06.980 --> 06:09.740
This is one of the hardest hit areas in their store.

06:09.740 --> 06:11.020
Now, when you want something.

06:11.020 --> 06:12.900
Get the fuck out of California, guys.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.420
Message goes off on the overhead speaker

06:15.420 --> 06:17.860
and an employee comes to unlock the freezer.

06:17.860 --> 06:20.620
Shoplifters have tried to burn the cases.

06:20.620 --> 06:23.580
There's been four shoplifters in a couple of hours.

06:23.580 --> 06:25.300
He was working at the store today.

06:25.300 --> 06:27.260
So basically stealing out of this store.

06:27.260 --> 06:29.020
He did not want his face on camera,

06:29.020 --> 06:32.340
but said he detained eight people shoplifting yesterday.

06:32.340 --> 06:33.180
People were-

06:33.180 --> 06:34.500
They just don't give a shit anymore, guys.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.980
So outside, if they cross the threshold,

06:36.980 --> 06:38.260
they can be put under arrest.

06:38.260 --> 06:40.500
The eight people that I took on yesterday,

06:40.500 --> 06:42.300
seven of them returned the items.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.860
It's a store didn't wish to put a citizen's arrest on.

06:45.580 --> 06:47.780
What the fuck?

06:47.780 --> 06:49.700
Yeah, man, California is literally

06:49.700 --> 06:51.900
just sinking into the fucking ocean.

06:51.900 --> 06:55.060
If you have a society where theft is permissible

06:55.060 --> 06:57.360
because lives are more important than property

06:57.360 --> 06:59.380
or whatever the fuck, this is what you get.

06:59.380 --> 07:01.340
Extremely low trust society.

07:01.340 --> 07:03.340
If you're an actual like legitimate shopper,

07:03.340 --> 07:04.380
you're shopping in hell

07:04.380 --> 07:06.060
because everything's fucking locked up.

07:06.060 --> 07:08.700
And eventually these stores will just close.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.140
I saw something recently that like Walmart's

07:11.140 --> 07:13.560
are pulling out of Portland, I think.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.220
That'll be part of a future video.

07:15.220 --> 07:16.760
You can't expect these corporations

07:16.760 --> 07:18.480
just keep taking losses forever.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.280
Eventually they will just leave.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.080
Oh, I think this next one's a self-help guy.

07:22.080 --> 07:22.920
Let's see.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.440
What if I told you there was a way to buy things

07:24.440 --> 07:26.220
like this $100,000 watch

07:26.220 --> 07:28.560
without spending a single dollar of your own money

07:28.560 --> 07:30.300
using business credit like this

07:30.300 --> 07:32.040
that you never actually had to pay back.

07:32.040 --> 07:32.880
Let's hear about it.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.300
To the average person, guys, this sounds crazy,

07:35.300 --> 07:37.520
but any business owner knows how this works.

07:37.520 --> 07:38.920
I don't know how personal credit works.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.560
Let's say for example,

07:40.560 --> 07:43.480
you will get a car or credit card in your personal name.

07:44.320 --> 07:45.440
You're personally held responsible for that.

07:45.440 --> 07:46.720
So if you were to go get a credit card

07:46.720 --> 07:47.880
in your personal name

07:47.880 --> 07:49.680
and you were to go max the card out,

07:49.680 --> 07:50.640
you're going to be held liable.

07:50.640 --> 07:51.680
And if you don't make that payment back,

07:51.680 --> 07:53.280
the bank could come and sue you.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.560
What makes us different about business credit

07:55.560 --> 07:56.680
with business credit,

07:56.680 --> 07:59.000
you are not personally held responsible

07:59.000 --> 08:00.280
for that line of credit.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.100
So let's say for example, how I got this watch,

08:03.100 --> 08:04.240
I was able to open a business

08:04.240 --> 08:05.880
that I didn't really give a shit about.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.560
I went and opened business credit cards in that account.

08:08.560 --> 08:11.840
I then proceeded to go on, buy this $400,000.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.180
I'm going to turn around and sell it to a jeweler

08:13.180 --> 08:16.040
for $80,000 in cash, which now gives me the cash.

08:16.040 --> 08:18.160
I'll file bankruptcy on the company.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.680
I'll never have to actually pay it back

08:20.680 --> 08:22.600
because I'm not personally liable

08:22.600 --> 08:24.080
for that American Express card.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.600
It's all liable underneath my business.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.440
Dude.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.260
It's weird to explain it in one video,

08:28.260 --> 08:30.120
but guys, if you're interested in getting involved in this

08:30.120 --> 08:31.200
and you could use some extra information.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.400
No, I'm not, sir.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.840
I want you to go to Instagram.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.840
No, no, do not.

08:35.840 --> 08:40.360
Okay, I like how he just openly admits to fraud on TikTok.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.360
This is where we are?

08:42.560 --> 08:44.880
I know like on the weekly sip and previous sips,

08:44.880 --> 08:46.580
I've talked about how like criminals

08:46.580 --> 08:47.680
who have murdered or something,

08:47.680 --> 08:50.280
they like taunt the cops on Facebook and then get caught.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.600
Like it's fucking stupid.

08:51.600 --> 08:55.920
You now got people out here just admitting fraud on TikTok.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.560
Be like, yeah, this is how you do it, dudes.

08:57.560 --> 08:58.920
This is the secret, guys.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.960
Here's how you get yourself a $100,000 watch, guys.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.720
And wait a minute, wait a minute.

09:02.720 --> 09:04.320
Get yourself a $100,000 watch.

09:04.320 --> 09:05.140
He bought the watch,

09:05.140 --> 09:06.960
then returned it and got $80,000 in cash.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.960
And then he filed for bankruptcy on the company.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.120
But if you return the watch for cash,

09:12.120 --> 09:14.360
how do you still have the watch?

09:14.360 --> 09:15.180
Hold on, fuck.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.780
Even his scummy ass ideas don't fucking sound right.

09:17.780 --> 09:18.620
Hold on.

09:18.620 --> 09:20.000
Things like this $100,000 watch.

09:20.000 --> 09:20.840
Yeah, there's the watch.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.560
Without spending a single dollar of your own money

09:22.560 --> 09:23.960
using business credit like this.

09:23.960 --> 09:24.800
Business credit, okay.

09:24.800 --> 09:25.760
That you never actually had to pay back.

09:25.760 --> 09:26.760
How I got this watch.

09:26.760 --> 09:27.600
How'd you get it?

09:27.600 --> 09:28.420
I was able to open a business

09:28.420 --> 09:29.560
that I didn't really give a shit about.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.240
Buy this for $100,000.

09:31.240 --> 09:32.540
I'm gonna turn around and sell it to a jeweler

09:32.540 --> 09:35.400
for $80,000 in cash, which now gives me the cash.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.520
I'll file bankruptcy on the company.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.160
I'll never have to actually pay it back.

09:39.560 --> 09:40.920
But how do you get the watch though, dude?

09:40.920 --> 09:43.280
You sell the watch back for $80,000.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.100
That gets you money.

09:44.100 --> 09:44.940
But how do you get the watch?

09:44.940 --> 09:47.680
You just do it again and then eventually buy the watch cash?

09:47.680 --> 09:48.520
I don't know, man.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.200
I just personally think admitting to your fraud on TikTok

09:51.200 --> 09:52.800
is not the greatest idea.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.960
Actually, let's see if his TikTok's still around.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.700
Green thumb.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.720
Let's see here.

09:59.720 --> 10:04.360
Yep, his main account had 114,000 likes, 8,000 followers.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.200
Wanna work together?

10:06.200 --> 10:07.780
DM me, yeah, so he can swindle you.

10:07.780 --> 10:08.680
Good idea.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.360
Oh, and I found his link tree.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.200
Let's see.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.200
Join the Drop Ship Academy.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.120
Oh God, drop shipping.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.400
It's one of those fucking scammers.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.540
I'm gonna have to do a video

10:18.540 --> 10:20.360
on the drop shipping nonsense at some point.

10:20.360 --> 10:21.740
It's fucking, I don't know if you guys know

10:21.740 --> 10:24.540
about this particular internet subculture,

10:24.540 --> 10:26.480
but it's really ridiculous and stupid.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.120
But it seems like this guy like just

10:28.120 --> 10:30.280
either got banned off TikTok

10:30.280 --> 10:31.800
or deleted his account or something.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.640
And I'm not surprised because Jesus Christ.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.440
Oh, it's the British cops this time.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.820
He just lightly jogs away.

10:42.820 --> 10:45.140
The two cops can't stop, wow.

10:45.140 --> 10:47.720
British cops are like, they're a fucking joke.

10:47.720 --> 10:49.180
They're a fucking joke.

10:49.180 --> 10:51.400
To be fair, considering the absurd laws

10:51.400 --> 10:53.360
they have to enforce, it's kind of good

10:53.360 --> 10:55.200
that they are a joke, but God damn.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.120
When you see British police trying to actually,

10:57.120 --> 10:58.800
you know, enforce a law on somebody,

10:58.800 --> 11:01.120
it's like, nah, I don't got to deal with this.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.120
And they can do it.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.360
There's no threat there.

11:04.440 --> 11:06.920
Yo dude, look at them titties.

11:06.920 --> 11:09.440
Oh man, it looks like that teacher

11:09.440 --> 11:12.080
with the ridiculously giant tits

11:12.080 --> 11:15.640
from the high school, the Canadian high school.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.800
They did a video on them back a few months ago.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.240
But holy shit, I guess this is what we're allowing now.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.080
Why not?

11:21.080 --> 11:23.160
Walk around with giant boobs, fuck it.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.140
If anyone complains, call them a bigot.

11:25.140 --> 11:28.640
If you are not black, if your skin is not brown,

11:28.640 --> 11:32.320
if you are not melanated, then you do not have the right

11:32.320 --> 11:34.800
to come under my videos talking about my law.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.680
And now we have an actual racist here.

11:36.680 --> 11:40.720
Your opinions are not wanted, nor are they relevant.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.720
So why do you feel like you need to come

11:42.720 --> 11:45.320
and keep saying something to my people?

11:45.320 --> 11:48.760
You need to ask me my permission before you speak

11:48.760 --> 11:50.280
or comment on my videos.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.920
You come under my video and say, Lord,

11:52.920 --> 11:56.920
may I please have your permission to say something.

11:56.920 --> 12:00.400
Then you wait for me to give you my permission

12:00.400 --> 12:04.040
before you start tapping, moving your little pasty fingers

12:04.040 --> 12:05.400
around my age.

12:05.400 --> 12:08.000
You people have been talking way too much

12:08.000 --> 12:12.880
for way too long, and your time is officially up.

12:12.880 --> 12:15.000
It is black power forever.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.760
What a legitimately hateful person,

12:16.760 --> 12:19.080
like deep down in their soul.

12:19.080 --> 12:21.720
I would hate to live my life like this person, my God.

12:21.720 --> 12:24.520
Her TikTok is the Black Messiah.

12:24.520 --> 12:29.000
All right, I guess that's where we are now.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.160
Let's see real quick.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.880
Wait, her account is gone too.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.720
These people just keep nuking their accounts

12:34.240 --> 12:36.280
every time they go viral with a dog shit fucking take

12:36.280 --> 12:37.960
or like a dumb short.

12:37.960 --> 12:38.840
Like what the fuck?

12:38.840 --> 12:40.640
Good riddance, I guess, but damn,

12:40.640 --> 12:42.080
I was hoping to find more spicy stuff.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.920
The conception that lesbian means a woman

12:43.920 --> 12:45.120
who loves other women.

12:45.120 --> 12:45.960
Doesn't it?

12:45.960 --> 12:48.320
And actually the definition is non-men

12:48.320 --> 12:51.360
who are attracted to and love other non-men.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.840
Throughout history, there have always been

12:52.840 --> 12:55.320
gender nonconforming lesbians.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.280
And it's interesting to see nowadays

12:57.280 --> 12:59.080
that there are some folks who kind of try to gatekeep

12:59.080 --> 13:00.280
that identity. Oh my fucking.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.520
And only include folks who identify as women.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.560
They're claiming butch women as trans.

13:05.560 --> 13:07.880
There are trans men who identified as a lesbian

13:07.880 --> 13:09.640
for many, many years and still feel comfortable

13:09.640 --> 13:11.800
within that community and that identity.

13:11.800 --> 13:14.600
There are non-binary folks of all kinds

13:14.600 --> 13:16.080
who identify as lesbians.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.000
This is stupid.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.520
There's like a zillion different ways to be a lesbian.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.880
And if that word is what's comfortable for you,

13:21.880 --> 13:23.800
then nobody can gatekeep it from you.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.360
I am non-binary, trans masculine, and I'm a lesbian.

13:26.360 --> 13:27.200
So true.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.880
I guess I'm a lesbian now too.

13:28.880 --> 13:29.720
Why not?

13:29.960 --> 13:32.680
This was a joke back when I was in high school.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.640
It would always be that one smart ass kid

13:34.640 --> 13:35.600
who would come up and say,

13:35.600 --> 13:38.320
well, lesbians are people who like women, right?

13:38.320 --> 13:40.640
So as a guy, you're a lesbian

13:40.640 --> 13:42.400
because I'm a person who likes women.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.680
And it's like, ha ha, I get it.

13:43.680 --> 13:44.600
You're being retarded.

13:44.600 --> 13:47.000
Now they're doing something like this unironically.

13:47.000 --> 13:47.840
So fine.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.440
I feel comfortable with this identity.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.840
So now I'm a lesbian.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.900
And if you complain, you're a bigot.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.800
All right guys, I can't take any more brain rot.

13:54.800 --> 13:55.620
I'm fucking off.

13:55.620 --> 13:57.480
I'll see you tomorrow for another video.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.040
I'll see you tonight for another stream.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.200
Make sure that you're there.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.120
And thanks very much.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.200
Have a good one.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.040
I love you.
