00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
Hello and welcome to The Weekly Sip, yeah I did change the name.

00:04.880 --> 00:12.040
And to commemorate, mmm, good stuff.

00:12.040 --> 00:16.840
I figured that for a weekly news show, SJ Weekly was kind of limiting in the topics

00:16.840 --> 00:18.180
that I wanted to cover.

00:18.180 --> 00:21.680
Don't worry, it'll still mostly be SJW nonsense though.

00:21.680 --> 00:26.360
For those of you who watched Yesterday's Dumping with Scrump, yes indeed, I am actually unemployed.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.720
I know you asked me about it in the comments, so I might as well...

00:29.720 --> 00:31.240
I can't tell the full story?

00:31.240 --> 00:33.200
I will one day, but I can't do it now.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.080
But I might as well tell you at least the surface level details.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.560
I didn't get fired, I quit.

00:38.560 --> 00:41.600
However, I quit because 1.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.520
The job was becoming untenable to stay at.

00:44.520 --> 00:48.680
Like I couldn't stay there and continue to do this or anything else that I wanted to

00:48.680 --> 00:50.000
do in my life.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.240
And something had to go.

00:51.240 --> 00:52.240
And 2.

00:52.240 --> 00:55.480
Because there was a fair chance I was going to be getting fired soon anyway.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.880
So I decided to just bow out with some dignity left intact.

00:58.880 --> 01:03.040
So I hope you don't mind if I shill a little bit here at the start of the video.

01:03.040 --> 01:09.280
If you feel like supporting the channel in these trying times, I do have a Subscribestar.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.800
Subscribestar dot com slash short fat otaku.

01:11.800 --> 01:15.720
As soon as I get my first payment off of it, which will probably be at the beginning of

01:15.720 --> 01:19.960
March, then I'll probably just axe the Patreon entirely.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.680
Because Patreon is a shit company, as we all know.

01:22.680 --> 01:27.160
If you'd rather just give to me directly though and not deal with somebody skimming 5% off

01:27.160 --> 01:32.060
the top, there is of course Paypal dot me slash short fat otaku.

01:32.060 --> 01:35.480
The problem with that though is that it's harder to keep track of any kind of rewards

01:35.480 --> 01:36.480
tiers.

01:36.480 --> 01:41.320
That is one thing that the Patreon Subscribestar model does well is that it organizes the rewards

01:41.320 --> 01:43.600
tiers for creators to be able to manage.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.440
I guess that's why Patreon is so stupid.

01:45.440 --> 01:49.680
Because the one thing they bring to the marketplace, convenience, they're going back on.

01:49.680 --> 01:56.520
Additionally, if you have no money, but you do have Amazon Prime, Amazon Prime gives one

01:56.520 --> 02:02.480
free Twitch sub, which is normally $5 and $2.50 go to the creators, $2.50 go to Twitch,

02:02.480 --> 02:04.840
but you get one free one with Amazon Prime.

02:04.840 --> 02:10.640
So if you feel like tossing that my way, you can go to Twitch dot TV slash Game Boomers.

02:10.640 --> 02:13.520
It's fine if you don't actually watch the streams, although I'd love to see you there.

02:13.520 --> 02:18.020
If you have a free Twitch sub from Amazon Prime that you're just not using, that's also

02:18.020 --> 02:19.700
a great way to support the channel.

02:19.700 --> 02:23.880
Because even though Game Boomers is a separate project, it still all goes towards supporting

02:23.880 --> 02:24.880
me.

02:24.880 --> 02:30.320
Like I said, I do have several alt channels if you'd like to sub to those because with

02:30.320 --> 02:35.040
enough subs, those can become monetized and therefore be alternative income streams.

02:35.040 --> 02:40.900
I've got SFO backups, which is basically where I'm going to post videos that wouldn't cut

02:40.900 --> 02:42.820
it on this channel.

02:42.820 --> 02:49.440
For example, the Don Thacker expose video, it went up on SFO backups.

02:49.440 --> 02:52.840
I've got the Game Boomers YouTube, which is basically just the stream archive for the

02:52.840 --> 02:54.880
Twitch Game Boomers channel.

02:54.880 --> 03:00.200
I upload the VODs in one hour chunks for anybody who happens to have missed the stream.

03:00.200 --> 03:04.200
The stream itself is significantly more popular than the actual VOD channel, but at least

03:04.200 --> 03:05.480
it's there for posterity.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.640
And that channel is almost a thousand subs, which is when YouTube will start taking it

03:08.640 --> 03:11.140
seriously and actually pushing it in the algorithm.

03:11.140 --> 03:13.040
So if that interests you, please go check it out.

03:13.040 --> 03:16.000
And the final channel I've started recently is called DevKit.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.200
And that channel is basically where I'm going to do all of my non-political work.

03:21.200 --> 03:26.560
So for example, the old anime reviews from 2009, they're all up on DevKit, with a few

03:26.560 --> 03:29.280
exceptions because YouTube doesn't like the hentai ones.

03:29.280 --> 03:34.080
I've also put some channel vlogs up there, I've put some behind the scenes stuff like

03:34.080 --> 03:37.160
set tours and studio tours and stuff like that.

03:37.160 --> 03:41.920
And I think at some point I might do like game reviews or hardware reviews or goofy

03:41.920 --> 03:43.280
shitposting.

03:43.280 --> 03:48.600
Basically the DevKit is going to be my shitposting channel, and also where I post like SFO channel

03:48.600 --> 03:51.520
updates and things like that, so they don't clog up this channel.

03:51.520 --> 03:54.560
This channel is going to be basically politics only going forward.

03:54.560 --> 03:59.760
I also plan to do the community streams on the DevKit channel, once that channel is capable

03:59.760 --> 04:02.280
of streaming, so please consider subbing to it.

04:02.280 --> 04:05.400
And speaking of that, the community stream was supposed to be yesterday.

04:05.400 --> 04:09.760
As it turns out, it wasn't yesterday, because my city suffered a terrible ice storm and

04:09.760 --> 04:12.560
the whole place lost power for about four hours.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.120
So I'm sorry about that guys, I'll make it up to you at some point.

04:15.120 --> 04:18.960
The movie I wanted to watch was the Super Mario Brothers movie.

04:18.960 --> 04:22.720
And how that works is that we all pile into a Discord channel and we all shitpost and

04:22.720 --> 04:25.080
talk while we watch this terrible movie.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.900
It's usually pretty fun, we do it once a month.

04:26.900 --> 04:31.920
That is one of the perks of supporting the channel, so now that I need the support, please

04:31.920 --> 04:32.920
consider joining in.

04:32.920 --> 04:37.480
And I guess the last thing to ask is, is there actually that much demand for merch?

04:37.480 --> 04:41.560
Because a few people have said I should do some merch in order to get some alternative

04:41.560 --> 04:42.560
revenue.

04:42.560 --> 04:46.800
But I'm really not sure if I'm popular enough that people would buy like, SFO mugs

04:46.800 --> 04:48.120
or t-shirts or something.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.320
I do have an SFO mug, it's pretty cool.

04:50.320 --> 04:54.500
I was considering selling this as merch, but there just wasn't enough interest back

04:54.500 --> 04:55.720
when I got this made.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.520
So if this is something that would actually interest you, please let me know.

04:58.520 --> 05:01.480
Sorry about the abundance of channel news this week, guys.

05:01.480 --> 05:04.200
Let's move on to the stupidity that happened this week.

05:04.200 --> 05:08.280
This time around, our dumbass of the week is Ron Perlman.

05:08.280 --> 05:09.280
Check this out.

05:09.280 --> 05:10.280
Sup, poll?

05:10.280 --> 05:16.120
Ron Perlman, 2-21-2019.

05:16.120 --> 05:23.040
I know, all caps, I know it is you bastards who keep making those memes of me.

05:23.040 --> 05:28.980
I don't know if you're all a bunch of Russians or what, but cut it out, it ain't funny.

05:28.980 --> 05:33.980
Your puppet president is going down soon, it's Mueller time, little stumplings.

05:33.980 --> 05:38.280
Imagine being Ron Perlman and not knowing how this fucking ends.

05:38.280 --> 05:43.440
Guys, guys, war never changes.

05:43.440 --> 05:49.760
University suspends student UKIP member, 19, who sparked outrage by saying the NHS should

05:49.760 --> 05:55.400
not be free to immigrants, and complained about the Islamization of Britain during class

05:55.400 --> 05:56.400
discussions.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.800
Damn, this guy's got a spine.

05:57.800 --> 06:01.760
They do say that nowadays being a conservative on campus is the counterculture.

06:01.760 --> 06:05.800
Sebastian Walsh, 19, was suspended from his university.

06:05.800 --> 06:10.160
Schoolwork student expressed controversial views on halal meat and Islam.

06:10.160 --> 06:13.760
The UKIP member complained the suspension contravenes his human rights.

06:13.760 --> 06:18.340
A student who claimed the NHS should not be free to immigrants, and lamented about the

06:18.340 --> 06:22.720
Islamization of Britain, has been kicked out of his university.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.680
Well come on now.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.480
First of all, by immigrants do you mean non-citizens?

06:27.480 --> 06:32.000
Because if someone immigrated to the UK but became a citizen, well then they are entitled,

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
aren't they?

06:33.000 --> 07:02.980
The 19-year-old student also branded halal meat barbaric and inhumane, and vowed to

07:02.980 --> 07:18.820
friends he would never eat at a subway or KFC due to the way the animals are killed.

07:18.820 --> 07:24.180
The self-proclaimed free speech advocate complained being struck off from university was a violation

07:24.180 --> 07:25.420
of his human rights.

07:25.420 --> 07:29.620
And if you're banning somebody for their association with UKIP, or any other political

07:29.620 --> 07:34.860
party or political position that doesn't actually advocate for violence against anybody,

07:34.860 --> 07:37.840
then yeah it would be a violation of those human rights.

07:37.840 --> 07:42.480
We had a discussion about the privatization of the NHS, and I simply said I don't think

07:42.480 --> 07:45.060
free healthcare should be available to immigrants.

07:45.060 --> 07:48.140
This is a view held by many people in the public and I believe I should be able to express

07:48.140 --> 07:49.180
them freely.

07:49.180 --> 07:51.480
I feel completely victimized.

07:51.480 --> 07:52.660
As he should.

07:52.660 --> 07:57.660
He didn't say I don't think the NHS's healthcare should be available to people of

07:57.660 --> 08:02.840
a certain race, of a certain religion, simply of a certain citizenship status.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.480
And that's not racist.

08:04.480 --> 08:05.920
It's not Islamophobic.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.300
The university spokesperson said,

08:08.300 --> 08:13.660
We are proud to host a campus community comprised of many cultures, faiths, nationalities, and

08:13.660 --> 08:14.660
beliefs.

08:14.660 --> 08:19.680
We value this rich diversity and we take seriously this responsibility to provide a safe and

08:19.680 --> 08:21.700
welcoming environment for all.

08:21.700 --> 08:26.680
The university promotes lawful, open debate, the discussion of varying views and academic

08:26.700 --> 08:32.040
freedom and has in place robust procedures to ensure this can take place.

08:32.040 --> 08:36.760
In this case, a number of official complaints were made by students regarding a series of

08:36.760 --> 08:42.180
offensive and inappropriate comments made by Sebastian Walsh during lectures and seminars.

08:42.180 --> 08:47.600
We cannot divulge the actual comments made by Sebastian as they formed part of a confidential

08:47.600 --> 08:48.600
investigation.

08:48.600 --> 08:53.940
However, they clearly breached a number of the university's conduct regulations, including

08:53.940 --> 08:58.000
those relating to harassment and bringing the university into disrepute.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.460
In line with our official procedures, an investigation ensued and a disciplinary hearing took place.

09:04.460 --> 09:08.540
The student has been temporarily suspended for the remainder of the academic year and

09:08.540 --> 09:12.680
is aware that on the successful completion of a diversity training course, he will be

09:12.680 --> 09:14.360
able to resume his studies.

09:14.360 --> 09:18.100
It kinda sucks, but here's what I would recommend to Sebastian.

09:18.100 --> 09:23.820
Like one, shut up, keep your head down, take the diversity training course, bullshit it

09:23.820 --> 09:27.760
because you can just tell them what they want to hear and you don't even have to believe

09:27.760 --> 09:30.740
it, they'll just let you back in so you can get your life back on track.

09:30.740 --> 09:33.540
Maybe it kinda sucks, but I don't think anybody would blame you for doing it if you want to

09:33.540 --> 09:36.500
just get through your university and then get a fucking job.

09:36.500 --> 09:40.340
Because the university is not the end all be all of adult life, so if you just want

09:40.340 --> 09:44.220
to power through and leave this shit behind and then, you know, keep your actual beliefs

09:44.220 --> 09:46.100
in check, you can do so.

09:46.100 --> 09:50.060
Alternatively, you could also fight them on this and that would be a noble fight in my

09:50.060 --> 09:51.060
opinion.

09:51.060 --> 09:56.300
The next course is also option 3, take the diversity training course and send me the

09:56.300 --> 09:58.860
info so I can make a video out of it.

09:58.860 --> 10:04.180
I've been compiling stuff from various viewers who attend universities and high schools all

10:04.180 --> 10:09.100
around the world and they're sending me SJW bullshit and at one point I'm going to have

10:09.100 --> 10:13.900
to make a video of just how terrible the indoctrination is.

10:13.900 --> 10:21.620
Speaking of UK academia, going spare, Brexit could cut off access to feminist journal.

10:21.620 --> 10:27.160
Brexit copyright issues may prevent researchers from consulting spare rib, which for two decades

10:27.160 --> 10:31.100
served as the most popular voice of women's liberation in the UK.

10:31.100 --> 10:34.700
Yeah, this is it, this is why we have to stop Brexit.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.560
This is the reason.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.340
Nothing else matters, this is number one on the top of the list.

10:39.340 --> 10:43.780
A bad Brexit could cut off access to a crucial feminist scholarly resource.

10:43.780 --> 10:48.980
In 2015, the British Library digitized and made available to international researchers,

10:48.980 --> 10:54.860
students and activists through the Jisc Journals program, a complete run of the pioneering

10:54.860 --> 10:58.180
British feminist magazine Spare Rib.

10:58.180 --> 11:01.440
This vital resource may now have to be closed down.

11:01.440 --> 11:06.120
Of all the perils looming with the possible no-deal Brexit, the unexpected effects on

11:06.120 --> 11:11.840
copyright laws may seem small fry, yet Spare Rib was the most popular voice of women's

11:11.840 --> 11:17.380
liberation for over 20 years in the heyday of feminism, and we surely know the invaluable

11:17.380 --> 11:22.240
significance of keeping archival evidence of our recent history, especially for a record

11:22.240 --> 11:25.200
as fiercely contested as second wave feminism.

11:25.200 --> 11:29.040
This is a non-issue, nobody should fucking care about this.

11:29.040 --> 11:33.840
Frankly the only reason why I even noticed this article is because the byline talked

11:33.840 --> 11:38.880
about Spare Rib as a crucial feminist scholarly resource.

11:38.880 --> 11:44.600
It reminded me of this older story from 2017, where a Ryerson instructor tells the student

11:44.600 --> 11:47.080
to only rely on feminist journals.

11:47.080 --> 11:51.000
On Twitter, my name is Josephine, I had a tweet, I told my sister to write an essay

11:51.000 --> 11:54.500
on the wage gap for her class, and this is her professor's reply.

11:54.500 --> 11:58.480
First off, your premise is wrong, the wage gap is very real, so the reason why you are

11:58.480 --> 12:02.800
having a problem is because you will not find any sources that state that the wage gap is

12:02.800 --> 12:04.240
false.

12:04.240 --> 12:08.680
The way the wage gap works largely today is through the glass ceiling.

12:08.680 --> 12:12.000
Perhaps you want to write your paper on the glass ceiling.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.200
You need to look at feminist sources on this issue.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.520
Feminist sources.

12:17.520 --> 12:22.520
Certainly not business sources, because as she says later, do not use business sources,

12:22.520 --> 12:25.240
they blame women, the reality is patriarchy.

12:25.240 --> 12:28.600
There is a ton of feminist research on this topic.

12:28.600 --> 12:36.360
Let's be honest, I would say probably 80% of all the research and papers and books that

12:36.360 --> 12:41.860
have come out of gender studies since its inception is completely useless.

12:41.860 --> 12:45.360
It's all ideological, it has no basis in fact.

12:45.360 --> 12:51.640
I don't think it's 100 for a variety of reasons that are probably too in depth to go into

12:51.640 --> 12:52.640
in this video.

12:52.640 --> 12:58.360
Maybe I'll make a video at some point on the minority of gender studies work that's actually

12:58.360 --> 13:04.440
decent, but in general the entire department in every single university is an ideological

13:04.440 --> 13:10.440
nightmare that is propped up by diversity hires and diversity councils, and has a shit

13:10.440 --> 13:15.960
ton of the school's money flowing into it while creating nothing of actual substance.

13:15.960 --> 13:21.860
So when I hear that Britain is going to lose a crucial feminist scholarly resource, I'm

13:21.860 --> 13:26.000
not too worried, and I think you shouldn't be too worried either.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.440
Let's hop across the pond.

13:27.440 --> 13:32.920
With women in combat roles, a federal court rules male-only draft unconstitutional.

13:32.920 --> 13:36.200
I actually agree with this, frankly.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.920
I don't think there should be a draft at all.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.840
Maybe that's because I'm Canadian and there's no draft here.

13:40.840 --> 13:45.720
An all-male draft has been ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge in Texas declaring that

13:45.720 --> 13:49.280
the time has passed for debating the role of women in the army.

13:49.280 --> 13:53.260
The decision deals the biggest legal blow to the Selective Service system since the

13:53.260 --> 13:57.540
Supreme Court upheld the draft registration process in 1981.

13:57.540 --> 14:02.320
The court ruled then that a male-only draft was fully justified because women were ineligible

14:02.320 --> 14:03.620
for combat roles.

14:03.620 --> 14:08.180
But US District Judge Gray Miller ruled late Friday that while historical restrictions

14:08.180 --> 14:13.720
on women serving in combat may have justified past discrimination, men and women are now

14:13.720 --> 14:15.580
equally able to fight.

14:15.580 --> 14:20.080
In 2015, the Pentagon lifted all restrictions for women on military service.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.080
And you know what?

14:21.080 --> 14:22.080
Fair enough.

14:22.080 --> 14:27.040
If there are going to be no restrictions between men and women in the military, then there

14:27.040 --> 14:28.720
should not be a male-only draft.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.460
Though, to be fair, it's not a draft anymore.

14:30.460 --> 14:35.360
It's called the Selective Service system, which is basically where men sign up so that

14:35.360 --> 14:39.200
they're in a database so that if there is going to be a potential draft, they're easy

14:39.200 --> 14:40.880
to get a hold of.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.280
And if you don't sign up for that Selective Service system, then you can't get student

14:44.280 --> 14:46.240
loans and you can't work for the government.

14:46.240 --> 14:50.620
And there's a whole bunch of other things that you can't do, which is kind of BS, frankly.

14:50.620 --> 14:51.960
So here's the question.

14:51.960 --> 14:55.640
Are they going to completely scrap the Selective Service system, or are they going to make

14:55.640 --> 15:00.740
all women who hit 18 have to sign up for it in order to be eligible for federal employment

15:00.740 --> 15:03.600
or student loans or whatever, just like men are?

15:03.600 --> 15:05.660
In my opinion, they should just scrap it.

15:05.660 --> 15:09.480
But I have a feeling that they might want to keep it in place, which I have to say is

15:09.480 --> 15:11.600
going to be a fucking nightmare.

15:11.600 --> 15:16.440
Congress has never fully examined whether men are physically better able to serve than

15:16.440 --> 15:17.440
women.

15:17.440 --> 15:22.040
In fact, he noted in a footnote, the average woman could conceivably be better suited physically

15:22.040 --> 15:26.480
for some of today's combat positions than the average man, depending on which skills

15:26.480 --> 15:28.200
the position required.

15:28.200 --> 15:32.320
Combat roles no longer uniformly require sheer size or muscle.

15:32.320 --> 15:34.920
You know, I can kind of see where they're coming from.

15:34.920 --> 15:39.900
There would be some limited circumstances where being smaller or more flexible could

15:39.900 --> 15:43.260
be a greater asset than being stronger or faster.

15:43.260 --> 15:48.780
But that's because we're talking about gendered averages and not individual qualifications.

15:48.780 --> 15:52.040
This is why I've always disliked the concept of diversity hires, because what you should

15:52.040 --> 15:58.960
do is simply implement a standard, don't make any mention of gender or race or anything

15:58.960 --> 16:04.980
else in the standard, and then let the chips fall where they may as it pertains to individuals

16:04.980 --> 16:06.260
meeting that standard.

16:06.260 --> 16:11.460
If it means that in some jobs you have more men, in some jobs you have more women, fine.

16:11.460 --> 16:15.440
It's more important that qualified people get into the right positions, and a qualified

16:15.440 --> 16:18.040
woman will get there on her own merits.

16:18.040 --> 16:21.600
But let's talk about an unqualified woman for a minute.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.280
How to play patriarchy chicken.

16:24.280 --> 16:28.800
Why I refuse to move out of the way for men.

16:28.800 --> 16:32.980
If you don't move out of the way for men, your commute changes.

16:32.980 --> 16:37.580
For one thing, I'm not going to lie about this, you do collide with a lot of men.

16:37.580 --> 16:43.120
Now I've lived in larger cities before, and whether it's buses or subways or trains, the

16:43.120 --> 16:47.640
stations and the vehicles themselves get quite crowded.

16:47.640 --> 16:52.240
And sometimes you do have to like slip between the cracks in a crowd.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.240
Just how it is.

16:53.240 --> 16:58.600
But this person has decided that she's simply just going to walk in a direct line from where

16:58.600 --> 17:00.920
she is to where she's going.

17:00.920 --> 17:04.280
And if there's a man in her way, that man's going to have to go around her.

17:04.280 --> 17:07.460
A few days ago, I was having a bad morning.

17:07.460 --> 17:12.740
My train tickets were expensive, my train was delayed, and my coffee was cold.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.680
But I cheered myself up by playing a game on my commute.

17:15.680 --> 17:19.700
The game is called patriarchy chicken, and the rules are simple.

17:19.700 --> 17:22.120
Do not move out of the way for men.

17:22.120 --> 17:27.220
How much of an asshole do you have to be to actually do this?

17:27.220 --> 17:32.200
Everybody on a commute moves out of the way of somebody at some point.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.340
Sometimes people move out of the way of you.

17:34.340 --> 17:36.660
Sometimes you move out of the way of other people.

17:36.660 --> 17:39.780
Somebody is like dancing around and slithering their way through the crowd.

17:39.780 --> 17:41.320
That's just how it is.

17:41.320 --> 17:47.060
And those few people, who are yeah usually men, who don't move out of the way for anybody?

17:47.060 --> 17:48.900
They're assholes.

17:48.900 --> 17:52.800
It's not a patriarchy thing, it's a them being a dick thing.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.660
And most men aren't that.

17:54.660 --> 17:57.860
If you're a woman, you find yourself constantly dodging.

17:57.860 --> 18:01.060
No if you're a person, you find yourself constantly dodging.

18:01.060 --> 18:05.360
Side-stepping men who are walking in your direction, being wiped out by a wheely suitcase

18:05.360 --> 18:11.180
dragged by a bee-suited man, moving to the side to let faster men past you, or just pausing

18:11.180 --> 18:15.700
to let men bustle in front of you onto the train, or into the lift, or onto the escalator,

18:15.700 --> 18:19.260
and on with their busy lives to their important jobs.

18:19.260 --> 18:22.900
You sound kind of bitter that your life isn't busy or important.

18:22.900 --> 18:25.940
If you don't move out of the way of men, your commute changes.

18:25.940 --> 18:30.260
For one thing, I'm not going to lie about this, you do collide with a lot of men.

18:30.260 --> 18:32.580
This is where the name of the game comes from.

18:32.580 --> 18:35.200
You need to really commit to patriarchy chicken.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.660
Don't let your social instinct to step to the side kick in.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.420
Men are going to walk into you.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.020
That isn't your fault.

18:42.020 --> 18:46.060
It sounds more like you're going to walk into men, and that would be your fault.

18:46.060 --> 18:50.100
The point of patriarchy chicken is not just that you get to where you're going marginally

18:50.100 --> 18:55.420
faster, although you do, or that you irritate a number of men, which you also do.

18:55.420 --> 19:00.860
The point is that men have been socialized for their entire lives to take up space.

19:00.860 --> 19:04.500
Men who would never express these thoughts out loud have nevertheless been brought up

19:04.500 --> 19:08.760
to believe that their right to occupy space takes precedent over anyone else's right

19:08.760 --> 19:10.020
to be there.

19:10.020 --> 19:14.240
They spread their legs on the tubes and trains, they bellow across coffee shops and guffaw

19:14.240 --> 19:17.380
in pubs, and they never ever give way.

19:17.380 --> 19:19.600
Men spread their legs because they have balls.

19:19.600 --> 19:24.560
The few men that bellow across coffee shops are assholes, and everyone who guffaws in

19:24.560 --> 19:28.600
a pub is having a good time, which is what they're there for.

19:28.600 --> 19:37.920
And if you actually think that all men, all 3.5 billion of us, never, ever give way, ever,

19:37.920 --> 19:39.760
you're fucking delusional.

19:39.760 --> 19:42.660
Women have not been socialized to take up space.

19:42.660 --> 19:46.420
Women have been socialized to give way, to alleviate, to conciliate, and to step to the

19:46.420 --> 19:47.420
side.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.020
This is so ingrained that we don't even think about it.

19:50.020 --> 19:54.740
We might stand up in meetings and make our point, even when we know a man will take the

19:54.740 --> 19:55.740
credit.

19:55.740 --> 20:00.280
We might dutifully delete the exclamation marks from our emails so as not to undermine

20:00.280 --> 20:03.300
ourselves, but we will still step to the side.

20:03.300 --> 20:08.320
This sounds like you have a self-confidence issue, which does tie in neatly to your earlier

20:08.320 --> 20:11.680
petty remarks about men having busy lives.

20:11.680 --> 20:15.280
I am an able-bodied 5'6 white woman.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.840
I move through this world with a lot of privilege.

20:17.840 --> 20:24.960
Well, okay, maybe, maybe you should step to the side as an able-bodied 5.6 white woman

20:24.960 --> 20:30.440
because at some point, you're not going to step to the side when it comes to the wrong

20:30.440 --> 20:34.820
person and you will no longer be able-bodied, you will be run the fuck over.

20:34.820 --> 20:39.460
And let's be honest, the main reason you have the gall to actually try this is because

20:39.460 --> 20:44.280
you live in a Western country where most men are cognizant of the fact that they're larger

20:44.280 --> 20:48.940
than women, they're stronger than women, and that if they bump into a woman, the woman

20:48.940 --> 20:53.000
is much more likely to be seriously hurt than they are.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.120
So while there are a minority of assholes who will plow through a crowd, most of them

20:57.120 --> 21:02.840
will see you marching in a straight line and specifically try to avoid hurting you because

21:02.840 --> 21:04.760
they're actually decent people.

21:04.760 --> 21:10.540
If you were to do this in, say, a large city in the third world somewhere, you know, an

21:10.540 --> 21:15.140
actual patriarchal shithole, but a place that is at least advanced enough to have some kind

21:15.140 --> 21:21.440
of transit system, you will find yourself constantly being knocked to the ground because

21:21.440 --> 21:23.360
nobody will give a shit about you.

21:23.360 --> 21:29.800
The fact that you can play patriarchy chicken and not be seriously hurt constantly shows

21:29.800 --> 21:32.700
that you don't actually live in a patriarchy.

21:32.700 --> 21:37.240
Let's finish it off with Stop Shaming Me for Taking a Photo with Tucker Carlson at a Funeral.

21:37.240 --> 21:39.260
This is written by Christina Pereira.

21:39.260 --> 21:45.460
She's a sex worker who used to work at one of Nevada's legal brothels and apparently

21:45.460 --> 21:49.420
legal brothel owner Dennis Hoff recently died.

21:49.420 --> 21:53.740
And both her and Tucker Carlson were at the funeral since they were both both friends

21:53.740 --> 21:54.740
of this guy.

21:54.740 --> 21:57.580
I woke up Saturday to a concerned text from my friend.

21:57.580 --> 22:01.440
I logged on to Twitter to see what fresh hell awaited me.

22:01.440 --> 22:07.540
And there it was a tweet from Kate Arthur, the chief Los Angeles correspondent for BuzzFeed

22:07.540 --> 22:12.000
News featuring a photo of me and Tucker Carlson that I had posted.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.440
Her tweet read, Remember Tucker Carlson's lecture during the height of family separation

22:16.440 --> 22:20.240
in June about how the left doesn't care about family values?

22:20.240 --> 22:24.680
Well, I'm not one to kink shame, but here he is with a sex worker.

22:24.680 --> 22:26.200
Go Tucker.

22:26.200 --> 22:32.400
And then it quotes Christina's two tweets saying tuck and hookers pass on cooties.

22:32.400 --> 22:33.400
It's true.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.720
And then there's the two of them.

22:34.720 --> 22:40.720
The Christina, our author Christina and Tucker Carlson having a cute moment in the photo.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.520
I'm playfully kissing him on the cheek as he turns away laughing.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.160
And that really is all that it seems to be.

22:45.160 --> 22:47.460
But let's examine this for a minute.

22:47.460 --> 22:55.720
The Federalist, the Federalist is publishing an article by a sex worker defending sex workers.

22:55.720 --> 23:00.520
And Tucker Carlson, a high profile conservative news anchor is completely fine with posing

23:00.520 --> 23:03.120
publicly with a sex worker.

23:03.120 --> 23:09.900
Meanwhile, it's BuzzFeed that is shaming sex work, shaming sex workers and shaming the

23:09.900 --> 23:15.100
men who lawfully casually interact with them in a non-sexual setting.

23:15.100 --> 23:16.780
What the fuck has happened to us?

23:16.780 --> 23:21.780
What happened that this insane reversal has taken place that the left are now the sexual

23:21.780 --> 23:26.020
prudes that want to censor everything and the right are the free spirits?

23:26.020 --> 23:27.020
How did this happen?

23:27.020 --> 23:28.980
Like, look at Kate Arthur's tweet.

23:28.980 --> 23:33.740
Well, I'm not one to kink shame, but here he is with a sex worker.

23:33.740 --> 23:38.820
See, everything that you say before the word but doesn't matter.

23:38.820 --> 23:40.560
You are one to kink shame.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.400
That is what your tweet is.

23:42.400 --> 23:49.100
It's kink shaming Tucker for not even anything kinky, just being friendly with a sex worker.

23:49.100 --> 23:51.380
Having an acquaintance who's a sex worker.

23:51.380 --> 23:52.800
That's something to report on.

23:52.800 --> 23:54.540
That's something to slander somebody with.

23:54.540 --> 23:57.580
And this is not from the religious right.

23:57.580 --> 23:58.900
BuzzFeed's not the religious right.

23:58.900 --> 24:00.660
Kate Arthur's not the religious right.

24:00.660 --> 24:02.700
This is from the social justice warriors.

24:02.700 --> 24:07.020
There was nothing scandalous or inappropriate about this moment with Carlson.

24:07.020 --> 24:10.980
It was a celebrity taking a few minutes out of his day to make a fan feel good.

24:10.980 --> 24:15.020
I approached Tucker and told him what a huge fan I was and he was kind enough to say yes

24:15.020 --> 24:16.020
to a photo.

24:16.020 --> 24:18.540
It was nothing more and nothing less.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.820
When I offered to buy him a drink, he declined.

24:20.820 --> 24:23.080
He had a club soda instead.

24:23.080 --> 24:27.380
I sat with Tucker and Mitchell and we shared stories about our late friend.

24:27.380 --> 24:31.140
We were three people from diverse backgrounds coming together to remember a man who touched

24:31.140 --> 24:32.780
all of our lives.

24:32.780 --> 24:35.640
I asked Mitchell if he would take a photo of Tucker and I.

24:35.840 --> 24:40.640
After taking the first silly one that Arthur irresponsibly grasped onto, we took a second

24:40.640 --> 24:43.880
normal photo, both smiling and facing the camera.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.000
And there you have it.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.360
This is the kind of thing that you would expect, you know, like religious church-going moral

24:49.360 --> 24:54.200
busybodies to latch onto in order to try and get somebody fired from their jaws because

24:54.200 --> 24:59.560
oh, a detail of their sexual life has come out even though it's not really that sexual.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.800
It looks bad, guys.

25:00.800 --> 25:01.980
It looks bad.

25:01.980 --> 25:04.000
But this isn't the religious right.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.160
The moral busybodies are coming from social justice.

25:06.160 --> 25:08.040
They're coming from the radical left.

25:08.040 --> 25:12.480
I hope this episode serves as a lesson to Arthur and her ilk, but I doubt it.

25:12.480 --> 25:17.540
She immediately blocked me when I attempted to explain the circumstances.

25:17.540 --> 25:21.780
We deserve better from journalists and I am getting tired of one fake news hit pieced

25:21.780 --> 25:22.920
after another.

25:22.920 --> 25:26.260
This is why people hate journalism now.

25:26.260 --> 25:28.640
This is why journalists are not trusted.

25:28.640 --> 25:31.380
It's not because of Trump screaming about fake news.

25:31.380 --> 25:37.900
It's because you guys act so reprehensibly, so horrifically disgusting that nobody wants

25:37.900 --> 25:40.500
to give you the benefit of the doubt anymore.

25:40.500 --> 25:43.780
Journalists today are so entitled, so egotistical.

25:43.780 --> 25:48.020
They are single-handedly destroying the fourth estate and we're all worse off for it.

25:48.020 --> 25:52.120
We need a robust system of journalism and these people aren't providing it.

25:52.120 --> 25:53.660
They're fucking raping it into the ground.

25:53.660 --> 25:55.580
All right, my chums, that's the end of it for me.

25:55.580 --> 25:56.580
Thank you very much.

25:56.580 --> 26:02.340
Post links in the description to those alternate channels and those ways to support the channel

if you do feel like partaking in any of those things I talked about at the start of the

26:06.100 --> 26:07.100
video.

26:07.100 --> 26:11.300
If you do, thank you very much for your support and even if you don't, thanks for being here.

26:11.300 --> 26:13.780
There's no obligation to do any of the stuff that I outlined.

26:13.780 --> 26:17.460
Just being here and hanging out and watching the videos are enough.

26:17.460 --> 26:20.100
I truly do appreciate each and every single one of you.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.060
All right, my friends, I will see you next time.
