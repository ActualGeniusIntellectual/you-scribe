1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Hello and welcome to The Weekly Sip, yeah I did change the name.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,040
And to commemorate, mmm, good stuff.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,840
I figured that for a weekly news show, SJ Weekly was kind of limiting in the topics

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,180
that I wanted to cover.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,680
Don't worry, it'll still mostly be SJW nonsense though.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,360
For those of you who watched Yesterday's Dumping with Scrump, yes indeed, I am actually unemployed.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,720
I know you asked me about it in the comments, so I might as well...

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,240
I can't tell the full story?

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,200
I will one day, but I can't do it now.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,080
But I might as well tell you at least the surface level details.

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,560
I didn't get fired, I quit.

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,600
However, I quit because 1.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,520
The job was becoming untenable to stay at.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,680
Like I couldn't stay there and continue to do this or anything else that I wanted to

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,000
do in my life.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,240
And something had to go.

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,240
And 2.

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,480
Because there was a fair chance I was going to be getting fired soon anyway.

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,880
So I decided to just bow out with some dignity left intact.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,040
So I hope you don't mind if I shill a little bit here at the start of the video.

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,280
If you feel like supporting the channel in these trying times, I do have a Subscribestar.

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,800
Subscribestar dot com slash short fat otaku.

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,720
As soon as I get my first payment off of it, which will probably be at the beginning of

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,960
March, then I'll probably just axe the Patreon entirely.

25
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,680
Because Patreon is a shit company, as we all know.

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,160
If you'd rather just give to me directly though and not deal with somebody skimming 5% off

27
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:32,060
the top, there is of course Paypal dot me slash short fat otaku.

28
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,480
The problem with that though is that it's harder to keep track of any kind of rewards

29
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
tiers.

30
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,320
That is one thing that the Patreon Subscribestar model does well is that it organizes the rewards

31
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,600
tiers for creators to be able to manage.

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,440
I guess that's why Patreon is so stupid.

33
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,680
Because the one thing they bring to the marketplace, convenience, they're going back on.

34
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,520
Additionally, if you have no money, but you do have Amazon Prime, Amazon Prime gives one

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,480
free Twitch sub, which is normally $5 and $2.50 go to the creators, $2.50 go to Twitch,

36
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,840
but you get one free one with Amazon Prime.

37
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,640
So if you feel like tossing that my way, you can go to Twitch dot TV slash Game Boomers.

38
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,520
It's fine if you don't actually watch the streams, although I'd love to see you there.

39
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,020
If you have a free Twitch sub from Amazon Prime that you're just not using, that's also

40
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,700
a great way to support the channel.

41
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,880
Because even though Game Boomers is a separate project, it still all goes towards supporting

42
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,880
me.

43
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,320
Like I said, I do have several alt channels if you'd like to sub to those because with

44
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,040
enough subs, those can become monetized and therefore be alternative income streams.

45
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,900
I've got SFO backups, which is basically where I'm going to post videos that wouldn't cut

46
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,820
it on this channel.

47
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:49,440
For example, the Don Thacker expose video, it went up on SFO backups.

48
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,840
I've got the Game Boomers YouTube, which is basically just the stream archive for the

49
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,880
Twitch Game Boomers channel.

50
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,200
I upload the VODs in one hour chunks for anybody who happens to have missed the stream.

51
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,200
The stream itself is significantly more popular than the actual VOD channel, but at least

52
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,480
it's there for posterity.

53
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,640
And that channel is almost a thousand subs, which is when YouTube will start taking it

54
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,140
seriously and actually pushing it in the algorithm.

55
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,040
So if that interests you, please go check it out.

56
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,000
And the final channel I've started recently is called DevKit.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,200
And that channel is basically where I'm going to do all of my non-political work.

58
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,560
So for example, the old anime reviews from 2009, they're all up on DevKit, with a few

59
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,280
exceptions because YouTube doesn't like the hentai ones.

60
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,080
I've also put some channel vlogs up there, I've put some behind the scenes stuff like

61
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,160
set tours and studio tours and stuff like that.

62
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,920
And I think at some point I might do like game reviews or hardware reviews or goofy

63
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,280
shitposting.

64
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,600
Basically the DevKit is going to be my shitposting channel, and also where I post like SFO channel

65
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,520
updates and things like that, so they don't clog up this channel.

66
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,560
This channel is going to be basically politics only going forward.

67
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,760
I also plan to do the community streams on the DevKit channel, once that channel is capable

68
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,280
of streaming, so please consider subbing to it.

69
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,400
And speaking of that, the community stream was supposed to be yesterday.

70
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,760
As it turns out, it wasn't yesterday, because my city suffered a terrible ice storm and

71
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,560
the whole place lost power for about four hours.

72
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,120
So I'm sorry about that guys, I'll make it up to you at some point.

73
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,960
The movie I wanted to watch was the Super Mario Brothers movie.

74
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,720
And how that works is that we all pile into a Discord channel and we all shitpost and

75
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,080
talk while we watch this terrible movie.

76
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,900
It's usually pretty fun, we do it once a month.

77
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,920
That is one of the perks of supporting the channel, so now that I need the support, please

78
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,920
consider joining in.

79
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,480
And I guess the last thing to ask is, is there actually that much demand for merch?

80
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,560
Because a few people have said I should do some merch in order to get some alternative

81
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
revenue.

82
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,800
But I'm really not sure if I'm popular enough that people would buy like, SFO mugs

83
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,120
or t-shirts or something.

84
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,320
I do have an SFO mug, it's pretty cool.

85
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,500
I was considering selling this as merch, but there just wasn't enough interest back

86
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,720
when I got this made.

87
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,520
So if this is something that would actually interest you, please let me know.

88
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,480
Sorry about the abundance of channel news this week, guys.

89
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,200
Let's move on to the stupidity that happened this week.

90
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,280
This time around, our dumbass of the week is Ron Perlman.

91
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,280
Check this out.

92
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
Sup, poll?

93
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:16,120
Ron Perlman, 2-21-2019.

94
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:23,040
I know, all caps, I know it is you bastards who keep making those memes of me.

95
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,980
I don't know if you're all a bunch of Russians or what, but cut it out, it ain't funny.

96
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:33,980
Your puppet president is going down soon, it's Mueller time, little stumplings.

97
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,280
Imagine being Ron Perlman and not knowing how this fucking ends.

98
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,440
Guys, guys, war never changes.

99
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,760
University suspends student UKIP member, 19, who sparked outrage by saying the NHS should

100
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,400
not be free to immigrants, and complained about the Islamization of Britain during class

101
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
discussions.

102
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,800
Damn, this guy's got a spine.

103
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,760
They do say that nowadays being a conservative on campus is the counterculture.

104
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,800
Sebastian Walsh, 19, was suspended from his university.

105
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,160
Schoolwork student expressed controversial views on halal meat and Islam.

106
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,760
The UKIP member complained the suspension contravenes his human rights.

107
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,340
A student who claimed the NHS should not be free to immigrants, and lamented about the

108
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,720
Islamization of Britain, has been kicked out of his university.

109
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,680
Well come on now.

110
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,480
First of all, by immigrants do you mean non-citizens?

111
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,000
Because if someone immigrated to the UK but became a citizen, well then they are entitled,

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
aren't they?

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:07:02,980
The 19-year-old student also branded halal meat barbaric and inhumane, and vowed to

114
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:18,820
friends he would never eat at a subway or KFC due to the way the animals are killed.

115
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:24,180
The self-proclaimed free speech advocate complained being struck off from university was a violation

116
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,420
of his human rights.

117
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,620
And if you're banning somebody for their association with UKIP, or any other political

118
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,860
party or political position that doesn't actually advocate for violence against anybody,

119
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,840
then yeah it would be a violation of those human rights.

120
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,480
We had a discussion about the privatization of the NHS, and I simply said I don't think

121
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,060
free healthcare should be available to immigrants.

122
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,140
This is a view held by many people in the public and I believe I should be able to express

123
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,180
them freely.

124
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,480
I feel completely victimized.

125
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,660
As he should.

126
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,660
He didn't say I don't think the NHS's healthcare should be available to people of

127
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,840
a certain race, of a certain religion, simply of a certain citizenship status.

128
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,480
And that's not racist.

129
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,920
It's not Islamophobic.

130
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,300
The university spokesperson said,

131
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,660
We are proud to host a campus community comprised of many cultures, faiths, nationalities, and

132
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,660
beliefs.

133
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,680
We value this rich diversity and we take seriously this responsibility to provide a safe and

134
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,700
welcoming environment for all.

135
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,680
The university promotes lawful, open debate, the discussion of varying views and academic

136
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:32,040
freedom and has in place robust procedures to ensure this can take place.

137
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,760
In this case, a number of official complaints were made by students regarding a series of

138
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,180
offensive and inappropriate comments made by Sebastian Walsh during lectures and seminars.

139
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,600
We cannot divulge the actual comments made by Sebastian as they formed part of a confidential

140
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
investigation.

141
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,940
However, they clearly breached a number of the university's conduct regulations, including

142
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,000
those relating to harassment and bringing the university into disrepute.

143
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,460
In line with our official procedures, an investigation ensued and a disciplinary hearing took place.

144
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,540
The student has been temporarily suspended for the remainder of the academic year and

145
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,680
is aware that on the successful completion of a diversity training course, he will be

146
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,360
able to resume his studies.

147
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,100
It kinda sucks, but here's what I would recommend to Sebastian.

148
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,820
Like one, shut up, keep your head down, take the diversity training course, bullshit it

149
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,760
because you can just tell them what they want to hear and you don't even have to believe

150
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,740
it, they'll just let you back in so you can get your life back on track.

151
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,540
Maybe it kinda sucks, but I don't think anybody would blame you for doing it if you want to

152
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,500
just get through your university and then get a fucking job.

153
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,340
Because the university is not the end all be all of adult life, so if you just want

154
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,220
to power through and leave this shit behind and then, you know, keep your actual beliefs

155
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,100
in check, you can do so.

156
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,060
Alternatively, you could also fight them on this and that would be a noble fight in my

157
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,060
opinion.

158
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,300
The next course is also option 3, take the diversity training course and send me the

159
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,860
info so I can make a video out of it.

160
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,180
I've been compiling stuff from various viewers who attend universities and high schools all

161
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,100
around the world and they're sending me SJW bullshit and at one point I'm going to have

162
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,900
to make a video of just how terrible the indoctrination is.

163
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:21,620
Speaking of UK academia, going spare, Brexit could cut off access to feminist journal.

164
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:27,160
Brexit copyright issues may prevent researchers from consulting spare rib, which for two decades

165
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,100
served as the most popular voice of women's liberation in the UK.

166
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,700
Yeah, this is it, this is why we have to stop Brexit.

167
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,560
This is the reason.

168
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,340
Nothing else matters, this is number one on the top of the list.

169
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,780
A bad Brexit could cut off access to a crucial feminist scholarly resource.

170
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:48,980
In 2015, the British Library digitized and made available to international researchers,

171
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,860
students and activists through the Jisc Journals program, a complete run of the pioneering

172
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,180
British feminist magazine Spare Rib.

173
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,440
This vital resource may now have to be closed down.

174
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,120
Of all the perils looming with the possible no-deal Brexit, the unexpected effects on

175
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,840
copyright laws may seem small fry, yet Spare Rib was the most popular voice of women's

176
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,380
liberation for over 20 years in the heyday of feminism, and we surely know the invaluable

177
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:22,240
significance of keeping archival evidence of our recent history, especially for a record

178
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,200
as fiercely contested as second wave feminism.

179
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,040
This is a non-issue, nobody should fucking care about this.

180
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,840
Frankly the only reason why I even noticed this article is because the byline talked

181
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,880
about Spare Rib as a crucial feminist scholarly resource.

182
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,600
It reminded me of this older story from 2017, where a Ryerson instructor tells the student

183
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,080
to only rely on feminist journals.

184
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,000
On Twitter, my name is Josephine, I had a tweet, I told my sister to write an essay

185
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,500
on the wage gap for her class, and this is her professor's reply.

186
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,480
First off, your premise is wrong, the wage gap is very real, so the reason why you are

187
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,800
having a problem is because you will not find any sources that state that the wage gap is

188
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,240
false.

189
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,680
The way the wage gap works largely today is through the glass ceiling.

190
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,000
Perhaps you want to write your paper on the glass ceiling.

191
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,200
You need to look at feminist sources on this issue.

192
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,520
Feminist sources.

193
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,520
Certainly not business sources, because as she says later, do not use business sources,

194
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,240
they blame women, the reality is patriarchy.

195
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,600
There is a ton of feminist research on this topic.

196
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:36,360
Let's be honest, I would say probably 80% of all the research and papers and books that

197
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,860
have come out of gender studies since its inception is completely useless.

198
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,360
It's all ideological, it has no basis in fact.

199
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,640
I don't think it's 100 for a variety of reasons that are probably too in depth to go into

200
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
in this video.

201
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:58,360
Maybe I'll make a video at some point on the minority of gender studies work that's actually

202
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:04,440
decent, but in general the entire department in every single university is an ideological

203
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,440
nightmare that is propped up by diversity hires and diversity councils, and has a shit

204
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,960
ton of the school's money flowing into it while creating nothing of actual substance.

205
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:21,860
So when I hear that Britain is going to lose a crucial feminist scholarly resource, I'm

206
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,000
not too worried, and I think you shouldn't be too worried either.

207
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,440
Let's hop across the pond.

208
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,920
With women in combat roles, a federal court rules male-only draft unconstitutional.

209
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,200
I actually agree with this, frankly.

210
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,920
I don't think there should be a draft at all.

211
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,840
Maybe that's because I'm Canadian and there's no draft here.

212
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,720
An all-male draft has been ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge in Texas declaring that

213
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,280
the time has passed for debating the role of women in the army.

214
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,260
The decision deals the biggest legal blow to the Selective Service system since the

215
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,540
Supreme Court upheld the draft registration process in 1981.

216
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,320
The court ruled then that a male-only draft was fully justified because women were ineligible

217
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,620
for combat roles.

218
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:08,180
But US District Judge Gray Miller ruled late Friday that while historical restrictions

219
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:13,720
on women serving in combat may have justified past discrimination, men and women are now

220
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,580
equally able to fight.

221
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:20,080
In 2015, the Pentagon lifted all restrictions for women on military service.

222
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
And you know what?

223
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
Fair enough.

224
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,040
If there are going to be no restrictions between men and women in the military, then there

225
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,720
should not be a male-only draft.

226
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,460
Though, to be fair, it's not a draft anymore.

227
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,360
It's called the Selective Service system, which is basically where men sign up so that

228
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,200
they're in a database so that if there is going to be a potential draft, they're easy

229
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,880
to get a hold of.

230
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,280
And if you don't sign up for that Selective Service system, then you can't get student

231
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,240
loans and you can't work for the government.

232
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,620
And there's a whole bunch of other things that you can't do, which is kind of BS, frankly.

233
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,960
So here's the question.

234
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,640
Are they going to completely scrap the Selective Service system, or are they going to make

235
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,740
all women who hit 18 have to sign up for it in order to be eligible for federal employment

236
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,600
or student loans or whatever, just like men are?

237
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,660
In my opinion, they should just scrap it.

238
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,480
But I have a feeling that they might want to keep it in place, which I have to say is

239
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,600
going to be a fucking nightmare.

240
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,440
Congress has never fully examined whether men are physically better able to serve than

241
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
women.

242
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,040
In fact, he noted in a footnote, the average woman could conceivably be better suited physically

243
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,480
for some of today's combat positions than the average man, depending on which skills

244
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,200
the position required.

245
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,320
Combat roles no longer uniformly require sheer size or muscle.

246
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,920
You know, I can kind of see where they're coming from.

247
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,900
There would be some limited circumstances where being smaller or more flexible could

248
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,260
be a greater asset than being stronger or faster.

249
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:48,780
But that's because we're talking about gendered averages and not individual qualifications.

250
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,040
This is why I've always disliked the concept of diversity hires, because what you should

251
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:58,960
do is simply implement a standard, don't make any mention of gender or race or anything

252
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:04,980
else in the standard, and then let the chips fall where they may as it pertains to individuals

253
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,260
meeting that standard.

254
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,460
If it means that in some jobs you have more men, in some jobs you have more women, fine.

255
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,440
It's more important that qualified people get into the right positions, and a qualified

256
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,040
woman will get there on her own merits.

257
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,600
But let's talk about an unqualified woman for a minute.

258
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,280
How to play patriarchy chicken.

259
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,800
Why I refuse to move out of the way for men.

260
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,980
If you don't move out of the way for men, your commute changes.

261
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,580
For one thing, I'm not going to lie about this, you do collide with a lot of men.

262
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:43,120
Now I've lived in larger cities before, and whether it's buses or subways or trains, the

263
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,640
stations and the vehicles themselves get quite crowded.

264
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,240
And sometimes you do have to like slip between the cracks in a crowd.

265
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
Just how it is.

266
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,600
But this person has decided that she's simply just going to walk in a direct line from where

267
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,920
she is to where she's going.

268
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,280
And if there's a man in her way, that man's going to have to go around her.

269
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,460
A few days ago, I was having a bad morning.

270
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:12,740
My train tickets were expensive, my train was delayed, and my coffee was cold.

271
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,680
But I cheered myself up by playing a game on my commute.

272
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,700
The game is called patriarchy chicken, and the rules are simple.

273
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,120
Do not move out of the way for men.

274
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:27,220
How much of an asshole do you have to be to actually do this?

275
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,200
Everybody on a commute moves out of the way of somebody at some point.

276
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,340
Sometimes people move out of the way of you.

277
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,660
Sometimes you move out of the way of other people.

278
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,780
Somebody is like dancing around and slithering their way through the crowd.

279
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,320
That's just how it is.

280
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:47,060
And those few people, who are yeah usually men, who don't move out of the way for anybody?

281
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,900
They're assholes.

282
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,800
It's not a patriarchy thing, it's a them being a dick thing.

283
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,660
And most men aren't that.

284
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,860
If you're a woman, you find yourself constantly dodging.

285
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,060
No if you're a person, you find yourself constantly dodging.

286
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,360
Side-stepping men who are walking in your direction, being wiped out by a wheely suitcase

287
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,180
dragged by a bee-suited man, moving to the side to let faster men past you, or just pausing

288
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,700
to let men bustle in front of you onto the train, or into the lift, or onto the escalator,

289
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,260
and on with their busy lives to their important jobs.

290
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,900
You sound kind of bitter that your life isn't busy or important.

291
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,940
If you don't move out of the way of men, your commute changes.

292
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,260
For one thing, I'm not going to lie about this, you do collide with a lot of men.

293
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,580
This is where the name of the game comes from.

294
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,200
You need to really commit to patriarchy chicken.

295
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,660
Don't let your social instinct to step to the side kick in.

296
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,420
Men are going to walk into you.

297
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,020
That isn't your fault.

298
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,060
It sounds more like you're going to walk into men, and that would be your fault.

299
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,100
The point of patriarchy chicken is not just that you get to where you're going marginally

300
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,420
faster, although you do, or that you irritate a number of men, which you also do.

301
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:00,860
The point is that men have been socialized for their entire lives to take up space.

302
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,500
Men who would never express these thoughts out loud have nevertheless been brought up

303
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,760
to believe that their right to occupy space takes precedent over anyone else's right

304
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,020
to be there.

305
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,240
They spread their legs on the tubes and trains, they bellow across coffee shops and guffaw

306
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,380
in pubs, and they never ever give way.

307
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,600
Men spread their legs because they have balls.

308
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,560
The few men that bellow across coffee shops are assholes, and everyone who guffaws in

309
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,600
a pub is having a good time, which is what they're there for.

310
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:37,920
And if you actually think that all men, all 3.5 billion of us, never, ever give way, ever,

311
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,760
you're fucking delusional.

312
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,660
Women have not been socialized to take up space.

313
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,420
Women have been socialized to give way, to alleviate, to conciliate, and to step to the

314
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,420
side.

315
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,020
This is so ingrained that we don't even think about it.

316
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,740
We might stand up in meetings and make our point, even when we know a man will take the

317
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,740
credit.

318
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,280
We might dutifully delete the exclamation marks from our emails so as not to undermine

319
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,300
ourselves, but we will still step to the side.

320
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:08,320
This sounds like you have a self-confidence issue, which does tie in neatly to your earlier

321
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,680
petty remarks about men having busy lives.

322
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,280
I am an able-bodied 5'6 white woman.

323
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,840
I move through this world with a lot of privilege.

324
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,960
Well, okay, maybe, maybe you should step to the side as an able-bodied 5.6 white woman

325
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,440
because at some point, you're not going to step to the side when it comes to the wrong

326
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,820
person and you will no longer be able-bodied, you will be run the fuck over.

327
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,460
And let's be honest, the main reason you have the gall to actually try this is because

328
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:44,280
you live in a Western country where most men are cognizant of the fact that they're larger

329
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,940
than women, they're stronger than women, and that if they bump into a woman, the woman

330
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,000
is much more likely to be seriously hurt than they are.

331
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,120
So while there are a minority of assholes who will plow through a crowd, most of them

332
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,840
will see you marching in a straight line and specifically try to avoid hurting you because

333
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,760
they're actually decent people.

334
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:10,540
If you were to do this in, say, a large city in the third world somewhere, you know, an

335
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:15,140
actual patriarchal shithole, but a place that is at least advanced enough to have some kind

336
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:21,440
of transit system, you will find yourself constantly being knocked to the ground because

337
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,360
nobody will give a shit about you.

338
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,800
The fact that you can play patriarchy chicken and not be seriously hurt constantly shows

339
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,700
that you don't actually live in a patriarchy.

340
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,240
Let's finish it off with Stop Shaming Me for Taking a Photo with Tucker Carlson at a Funeral.

341
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,260
This is written by Christina Pereira.

342
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:45,460
She's a sex worker who used to work at one of Nevada's legal brothels and apparently

343
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,420
legal brothel owner Dennis Hoff recently died.

344
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,740
And both her and Tucker Carlson were at the funeral since they were both both friends

345
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,740
of this guy.

346
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,580
I woke up Saturday to a concerned text from my friend.

347
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,440
I logged on to Twitter to see what fresh hell awaited me.

348
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,540
And there it was a tweet from Kate Arthur, the chief Los Angeles correspondent for BuzzFeed

349
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:12,000
News featuring a photo of me and Tucker Carlson that I had posted.

350
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,440
Her tweet read, Remember Tucker Carlson's lecture during the height of family separation

351
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,240
in June about how the left doesn't care about family values?

352
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,680
Well, I'm not one to kink shame, but here he is with a sex worker.

353
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,200
Go Tucker.

354
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:32,400
And then it quotes Christina's two tweets saying tuck and hookers pass on cooties.

355
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
It's true.

356
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,720
And then there's the two of them.

357
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,720
The Christina, our author Christina and Tucker Carlson having a cute moment in the photo.

358
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,520
I'm playfully kissing him on the cheek as he turns away laughing.

359
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,160
And that really is all that it seems to be.

360
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,460
But let's examine this for a minute.

361
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:55,720
The Federalist, the Federalist is publishing an article by a sex worker defending sex workers.

362
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,520
And Tucker Carlson, a high profile conservative news anchor is completely fine with posing

363
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,120
publicly with a sex worker.

364
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,900
Meanwhile, it's BuzzFeed that is shaming sex work, shaming sex workers and shaming the

365
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:15,100
men who lawfully casually interact with them in a non-sexual setting.

366
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,780
What the fuck has happened to us?

367
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,780
What happened that this insane reversal has taken place that the left are now the sexual

368
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:26,020
prudes that want to censor everything and the right are the free spirits?

369
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,020
How did this happen?

370
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,980
Like, look at Kate Arthur's tweet.

371
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,740
Well, I'm not one to kink shame, but here he is with a sex worker.

372
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,820
See, everything that you say before the word but doesn't matter.

373
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,560
You are one to kink shame.

374
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,400
That is what your tweet is.

375
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:49,100
It's kink shaming Tucker for not even anything kinky, just being friendly with a sex worker.

376
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,380
Having an acquaintance who's a sex worker.

377
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,800
That's something to report on.

378
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,540
That's something to slander somebody with.

379
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,580
And this is not from the religious right.

380
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,900
BuzzFeed's not the religious right.

381
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,660
Kate Arthur's not the religious right.

382
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,700
This is from the social justice warriors.

383
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,020
There was nothing scandalous or inappropriate about this moment with Carlson.

384
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,980
It was a celebrity taking a few minutes out of his day to make a fan feel good.

385
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,020
I approached Tucker and told him what a huge fan I was and he was kind enough to say yes

386
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,020
to a photo.

387
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,540
It was nothing more and nothing less.

388
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,820
When I offered to buy him a drink, he declined.

389
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,080
He had a club soda instead.

390
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,380
I sat with Tucker and Mitchell and we shared stories about our late friend.

391
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,140
We were three people from diverse backgrounds coming together to remember a man who touched

392
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,780
all of our lives.

393
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,640
I asked Mitchell if he would take a photo of Tucker and I.

394
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,640
After taking the first silly one that Arthur irresponsibly grasped onto, we took a second

395
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,880
normal photo, both smiling and facing the camera.

396
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,000
And there you have it.

397
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,360
This is the kind of thing that you would expect, you know, like religious church-going moral

398
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,200
busybodies to latch onto in order to try and get somebody fired from their jaws because

399
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,560
oh, a detail of their sexual life has come out even though it's not really that sexual.

400
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,800
It looks bad, guys.

401
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,980
It looks bad.

402
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,000
But this isn't the religious right.

403
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,160
The moral busybodies are coming from social justice.

404
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,040
They're coming from the radical left.

405
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,480
I hope this episode serves as a lesson to Arthur and her ilk, but I doubt it.

406
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,540
She immediately blocked me when I attempted to explain the circumstances.

407
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,780
We deserve better from journalists and I am getting tired of one fake news hit pieced

408
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,920
after another.

409
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,260
This is why people hate journalism now.

410
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,640
This is why journalists are not trusted.

411
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,380
It's not because of Trump screaming about fake news.

412
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:37,900
It's because you guys act so reprehensibly, so horrifically disgusting that nobody wants

413
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,500
to give you the benefit of the doubt anymore.

414
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,780
Journalists today are so entitled, so egotistical.

415
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:48,020
They are single-handedly destroying the fourth estate and we're all worse off for it.

416
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:52,120
We need a robust system of journalism and these people aren't providing it.

417
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,660
They're fucking raping it into the ground.

418
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,580
All right, my chums, that's the end of it for me.

419
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,580
Thank you very much.

420
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:02,340
Post links in the description to those alternate channels and those ways to support the channel

421
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,100
if you do feel like partaking in any of those things I talked about at the start of the

422
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,100
video.

423
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,300
If you do, thank you very much for your support and even if you don't, thanks for being here.

424
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,780
There's no obligation to do any of the stuff that I outlined.

425
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,460
Just being here and hanging out and watching the videos are enough.

426
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,100
I truly do appreciate each and every single one of you.

427
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,060
All right, my friends, I will see you next time.
