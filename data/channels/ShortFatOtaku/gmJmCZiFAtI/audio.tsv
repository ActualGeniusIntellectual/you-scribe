0	4880	Hello and welcome to The Weekly Sip, yeah I did change the name.
4880	12040	And to commemorate, mmm, good stuff.
12040	16840	I figured that for a weekly news show, SJ Weekly was kind of limiting in the topics
16840	18180	that I wanted to cover.
18180	21680	Don't worry, it'll still mostly be SJW nonsense though.
21680	26360	For those of you who watched Yesterday's Dumping with Scrump, yes indeed, I am actually unemployed.
26360	29720	I know you asked me about it in the comments, so I might as well...
29720	31240	I can't tell the full story?
31240	33200	I will one day, but I can't do it now.
33200	36080	But I might as well tell you at least the surface level details.
36080	38560	I didn't get fired, I quit.
38560	41600	However, I quit because 1.
41600	44520	The job was becoming untenable to stay at.
44520	48680	Like I couldn't stay there and continue to do this or anything else that I wanted to
48680	50000	do in my life.
50000	51240	And something had to go.
51240	52240	And 2.
52240	55480	Because there was a fair chance I was going to be getting fired soon anyway.
55480	58880	So I decided to just bow out with some dignity left intact.
58880	63040	So I hope you don't mind if I shill a little bit here at the start of the video.
63040	69280	If you feel like supporting the channel in these trying times, I do have a Subscribestar.
69280	71800	Subscribestar dot com slash short fat otaku.
71800	75720	As soon as I get my first payment off of it, which will probably be at the beginning of
75720	79960	March, then I'll probably just axe the Patreon entirely.
79960	82680	Because Patreon is a shit company, as we all know.
82680	87160	If you'd rather just give to me directly though and not deal with somebody skimming 5% off
87160	92060	the top, there is of course Paypal dot me slash short fat otaku.
92060	95480	The problem with that though is that it's harder to keep track of any kind of rewards
95480	96480	tiers.
96480	101320	That is one thing that the Patreon Subscribestar model does well is that it organizes the rewards
101320	103600	tiers for creators to be able to manage.
103600	105440	I guess that's why Patreon is so stupid.
105440	109680	Because the one thing they bring to the marketplace, convenience, they're going back on.
109680	116520	Additionally, if you have no money, but you do have Amazon Prime, Amazon Prime gives one
116520	122480	free Twitch sub, which is normally $5 and $2.50 go to the creators, $2.50 go to Twitch,
122480	124840	but you get one free one with Amazon Prime.
124840	130640	So if you feel like tossing that my way, you can go to Twitch dot TV slash Game Boomers.
130640	133520	It's fine if you don't actually watch the streams, although I'd love to see you there.
133520	138020	If you have a free Twitch sub from Amazon Prime that you're just not using, that's also
138020	139700	a great way to support the channel.
139700	143880	Because even though Game Boomers is a separate project, it still all goes towards supporting
143880	144880	me.
144880	150320	Like I said, I do have several alt channels if you'd like to sub to those because with
150320	155040	enough subs, those can become monetized and therefore be alternative income streams.
155040	160900	I've got SFO backups, which is basically where I'm going to post videos that wouldn't cut
160900	162820	it on this channel.
162820	169440	For example, the Don Thacker expose video, it went up on SFO backups.
169440	172840	I've got the Game Boomers YouTube, which is basically just the stream archive for the
172840	174880	Twitch Game Boomers channel.
174880	180200	I upload the VODs in one hour chunks for anybody who happens to have missed the stream.
180200	184200	The stream itself is significantly more popular than the actual VOD channel, but at least
184200	185480	it's there for posterity.
185480	188640	And that channel is almost a thousand subs, which is when YouTube will start taking it
188640	191140	seriously and actually pushing it in the algorithm.
191140	193040	So if that interests you, please go check it out.
193040	196000	And the final channel I've started recently is called DevKit.
196000	201200	And that channel is basically where I'm going to do all of my non-political work.
201200	206560	So for example, the old anime reviews from 2009, they're all up on DevKit, with a few
206560	209280	exceptions because YouTube doesn't like the hentai ones.
209280	214080	I've also put some channel vlogs up there, I've put some behind the scenes stuff like
214080	217160	set tours and studio tours and stuff like that.
217160	221920	And I think at some point I might do like game reviews or hardware reviews or goofy
221920	223280	shitposting.
223280	228600	Basically the DevKit is going to be my shitposting channel, and also where I post like SFO channel
228600	231520	updates and things like that, so they don't clog up this channel.
231520	234560	This channel is going to be basically politics only going forward.
234560	239760	I also plan to do the community streams on the DevKit channel, once that channel is capable
239760	242280	of streaming, so please consider subbing to it.
242280	245400	And speaking of that, the community stream was supposed to be yesterday.
245400	249760	As it turns out, it wasn't yesterday, because my city suffered a terrible ice storm and
249760	252560	the whole place lost power for about four hours.
252560	255120	So I'm sorry about that guys, I'll make it up to you at some point.
255120	258960	The movie I wanted to watch was the Super Mario Brothers movie.
258960	262720	And how that works is that we all pile into a Discord channel and we all shitpost and
262720	265080	talk while we watch this terrible movie.
265080	266900	It's usually pretty fun, we do it once a month.
266900	271920	That is one of the perks of supporting the channel, so now that I need the support, please
271920	272920	consider joining in.
272920	277480	And I guess the last thing to ask is, is there actually that much demand for merch?
277480	281560	Because a few people have said I should do some merch in order to get some alternative
281560	282560	revenue.
282560	286800	But I'm really not sure if I'm popular enough that people would buy like, SFO mugs
286800	288120	or t-shirts or something.
288120	290320	I do have an SFO mug, it's pretty cool.
290320	294500	I was considering selling this as merch, but there just wasn't enough interest back
294500	295720	when I got this made.
295720	298520	So if this is something that would actually interest you, please let me know.
298520	301480	Sorry about the abundance of channel news this week, guys.
301480	304200	Let's move on to the stupidity that happened this week.
304200	308280	This time around, our dumbass of the week is Ron Perlman.
308280	309280	Check this out.
309280	310280	Sup, poll?
310280	316120	Ron Perlman, 2-21-2019.
316120	323040	I know, all caps, I know it is you bastards who keep making those memes of me.
323040	328980	I don't know if you're all a bunch of Russians or what, but cut it out, it ain't funny.
328980	333980	Your puppet president is going down soon, it's Mueller time, little stumplings.
333980	338280	Imagine being Ron Perlman and not knowing how this fucking ends.
338280	343440	Guys, guys, war never changes.
343440	349760	University suspends student UKIP member, 19, who sparked outrage by saying the NHS should
349760	355400	not be free to immigrants, and complained about the Islamization of Britain during class
355400	356400	discussions.
356400	357800	Damn, this guy's got a spine.
357800	361760	They do say that nowadays being a conservative on campus is the counterculture.
361760	365800	Sebastian Walsh, 19, was suspended from his university.
365800	370160	Schoolwork student expressed controversial views on halal meat and Islam.
370160	373760	The UKIP member complained the suspension contravenes his human rights.
373760	378340	A student who claimed the NHS should not be free to immigrants, and lamented about the
378340	382720	Islamization of Britain, has been kicked out of his university.
382720	384680	Well come on now.
384680	387480	First of all, by immigrants do you mean non-citizens?
387480	392000	Because if someone immigrated to the UK but became a citizen, well then they are entitled,
392000	393000	aren't they?
393000	422980	The 19-year-old student also branded halal meat barbaric and inhumane, and vowed to
422980	438820	friends he would never eat at a subway or KFC due to the way the animals are killed.
438820	444180	The self-proclaimed free speech advocate complained being struck off from university was a violation
444180	445420	of his human rights.
445420	449620	And if you're banning somebody for their association with UKIP, or any other political
449620	454860	party or political position that doesn't actually advocate for violence against anybody,
454860	457840	then yeah it would be a violation of those human rights.
457840	462480	We had a discussion about the privatization of the NHS, and I simply said I don't think
462480	465060	free healthcare should be available to immigrants.
465060	468140	This is a view held by many people in the public and I believe I should be able to express
468140	469180	them freely.
469180	471480	I feel completely victimized.
471480	472660	As he should.
472660	477660	He didn't say I don't think the NHS's healthcare should be available to people of
477660	482840	a certain race, of a certain religion, simply of a certain citizenship status.
482840	484480	And that's not racist.
484480	485920	It's not Islamophobic.
485920	488300	The university spokesperson said,
488300	493660	We are proud to host a campus community comprised of many cultures, faiths, nationalities, and
493660	494660	beliefs.
494660	499680	We value this rich diversity and we take seriously this responsibility to provide a safe and
499680	501700	welcoming environment for all.
501700	506680	The university promotes lawful, open debate, the discussion of varying views and academic
506700	512040	freedom and has in place robust procedures to ensure this can take place.
512040	516760	In this case, a number of official complaints were made by students regarding a series of
516760	522180	offensive and inappropriate comments made by Sebastian Walsh during lectures and seminars.
522180	527600	We cannot divulge the actual comments made by Sebastian as they formed part of a confidential
527600	528600	investigation.
528600	533940	However, they clearly breached a number of the university's conduct regulations, including
533940	538000	those relating to harassment and bringing the university into disrepute.
538000	544460	In line with our official procedures, an investigation ensued and a disciplinary hearing took place.
544460	548540	The student has been temporarily suspended for the remainder of the academic year and
548540	552680	is aware that on the successful completion of a diversity training course, he will be
552680	554360	able to resume his studies.
554360	558100	It kinda sucks, but here's what I would recommend to Sebastian.
558100	563820	Like one, shut up, keep your head down, take the diversity training course, bullshit it
563820	567760	because you can just tell them what they want to hear and you don't even have to believe
567760	570740	it, they'll just let you back in so you can get your life back on track.
570740	573540	Maybe it kinda sucks, but I don't think anybody would blame you for doing it if you want to
573540	576500	just get through your university and then get a fucking job.
576500	580340	Because the university is not the end all be all of adult life, so if you just want
580340	584220	to power through and leave this shit behind and then, you know, keep your actual beliefs
584220	586100	in check, you can do so.
586100	590060	Alternatively, you could also fight them on this and that would be a noble fight in my
590060	591060	opinion.
591060	596300	The next course is also option 3, take the diversity training course and send me the
596300	598860	info so I can make a video out of it.
598860	604180	I've been compiling stuff from various viewers who attend universities and high schools all
604180	609100	around the world and they're sending me SJW bullshit and at one point I'm going to have
609100	613900	to make a video of just how terrible the indoctrination is.
613900	621620	Speaking of UK academia, going spare, Brexit could cut off access to feminist journal.
621620	627160	Brexit copyright issues may prevent researchers from consulting spare rib, which for two decades
627160	631100	served as the most popular voice of women's liberation in the UK.
631100	634700	Yeah, this is it, this is why we have to stop Brexit.
634700	636560	This is the reason.
636560	639340	Nothing else matters, this is number one on the top of the list.
639340	643780	A bad Brexit could cut off access to a crucial feminist scholarly resource.
643780	648980	In 2015, the British Library digitized and made available to international researchers,
648980	654860	students and activists through the Jisc Journals program, a complete run of the pioneering
654860	658180	British feminist magazine Spare Rib.
658180	661440	This vital resource may now have to be closed down.
661440	666120	Of all the perils looming with the possible no-deal Brexit, the unexpected effects on
666120	671840	copyright laws may seem small fry, yet Spare Rib was the most popular voice of women's
671840	677380	liberation for over 20 years in the heyday of feminism, and we surely know the invaluable
677380	682240	significance of keeping archival evidence of our recent history, especially for a record
682240	685200	as fiercely contested as second wave feminism.
685200	689040	This is a non-issue, nobody should fucking care about this.
689040	693840	Frankly the only reason why I even noticed this article is because the byline talked
693840	698880	about Spare Rib as a crucial feminist scholarly resource.
698880	704600	It reminded me of this older story from 2017, where a Ryerson instructor tells the student
704600	707080	to only rely on feminist journals.
707080	711000	On Twitter, my name is Josephine, I had a tweet, I told my sister to write an essay
711000	714500	on the wage gap for her class, and this is her professor's reply.
714500	718480	First off, your premise is wrong, the wage gap is very real, so the reason why you are
718480	722800	having a problem is because you will not find any sources that state that the wage gap is
722800	724240	false.
724240	728680	The way the wage gap works largely today is through the glass ceiling.
728680	732000	Perhaps you want to write your paper on the glass ceiling.
732000	736200	You need to look at feminist sources on this issue.
736200	737520	Feminist sources.
737520	742520	Certainly not business sources, because as she says later, do not use business sources,
742520	745240	they blame women, the reality is patriarchy.
745240	748600	There is a ton of feminist research on this topic.
748600	756360	Let's be honest, I would say probably 80% of all the research and papers and books that
756360	761860	have come out of gender studies since its inception is completely useless.
761860	765360	It's all ideological, it has no basis in fact.
765360	771640	I don't think it's 100 for a variety of reasons that are probably too in depth to go into
771640	772640	in this video.
772640	778360	Maybe I'll make a video at some point on the minority of gender studies work that's actually
778360	784440	decent, but in general the entire department in every single university is an ideological
784440	790440	nightmare that is propped up by diversity hires and diversity councils, and has a shit
790440	795960	ton of the school's money flowing into it while creating nothing of actual substance.
795960	801860	So when I hear that Britain is going to lose a crucial feminist scholarly resource, I'm
801860	806000	not too worried, and I think you shouldn't be too worried either.
806000	807440	Let's hop across the pond.
807440	812920	With women in combat roles, a federal court rules male-only draft unconstitutional.
812920	816200	I actually agree with this, frankly.
816200	817920	I don't think there should be a draft at all.
817920	820840	Maybe that's because I'm Canadian and there's no draft here.
820840	825720	An all-male draft has been ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge in Texas declaring that
825720	829280	the time has passed for debating the role of women in the army.
829280	833260	The decision deals the biggest legal blow to the Selective Service system since the
833260	837540	Supreme Court upheld the draft registration process in 1981.
837540	842320	The court ruled then that a male-only draft was fully justified because women were ineligible
842320	843620	for combat roles.
843620	848180	But US District Judge Gray Miller ruled late Friday that while historical restrictions
848180	853720	on women serving in combat may have justified past discrimination, men and women are now
853720	855580	equally able to fight.
855580	860080	In 2015, the Pentagon lifted all restrictions for women on military service.
860080	861080	And you know what?
861080	862080	Fair enough.
862080	867040	If there are going to be no restrictions between men and women in the military, then there
867040	868720	should not be a male-only draft.
868720	870460	Though, to be fair, it's not a draft anymore.
870460	875360	It's called the Selective Service system, which is basically where men sign up so that
875360	879200	they're in a database so that if there is going to be a potential draft, they're easy
879200	880880	to get a hold of.
880880	884280	And if you don't sign up for that Selective Service system, then you can't get student
884280	886240	loans and you can't work for the government.
886240	890620	And there's a whole bunch of other things that you can't do, which is kind of BS, frankly.
890620	891960	So here's the question.
891960	895640	Are they going to completely scrap the Selective Service system, or are they going to make
895640	900740	all women who hit 18 have to sign up for it in order to be eligible for federal employment
900740	903600	or student loans or whatever, just like men are?
903600	905660	In my opinion, they should just scrap it.
905660	909480	But I have a feeling that they might want to keep it in place, which I have to say is
909480	911600	going to be a fucking nightmare.
911600	916440	Congress has never fully examined whether men are physically better able to serve than
916440	917440	women.
917440	922040	In fact, he noted in a footnote, the average woman could conceivably be better suited physically
922040	926480	for some of today's combat positions than the average man, depending on which skills
926480	928200	the position required.
928200	932320	Combat roles no longer uniformly require sheer size or muscle.
932320	934920	You know, I can kind of see where they're coming from.
934920	939900	There would be some limited circumstances where being smaller or more flexible could
939900	943260	be a greater asset than being stronger or faster.
943260	948780	But that's because we're talking about gendered averages and not individual qualifications.
948780	952040	This is why I've always disliked the concept of diversity hires, because what you should
952040	958960	do is simply implement a standard, don't make any mention of gender or race or anything
958960	964980	else in the standard, and then let the chips fall where they may as it pertains to individuals
964980	966260	meeting that standard.
966260	971460	If it means that in some jobs you have more men, in some jobs you have more women, fine.
971460	975440	It's more important that qualified people get into the right positions, and a qualified
975440	978040	woman will get there on her own merits.
978040	981600	But let's talk about an unqualified woman for a minute.
981600	984280	How to play patriarchy chicken.
984280	988800	Why I refuse to move out of the way for men.
988800	992980	If you don't move out of the way for men, your commute changes.
992980	997580	For one thing, I'm not going to lie about this, you do collide with a lot of men.
997580	1003120	Now I've lived in larger cities before, and whether it's buses or subways or trains, the
1003120	1007640	stations and the vehicles themselves get quite crowded.
1007640	1012240	And sometimes you do have to like slip between the cracks in a crowd.
1012240	1013240	Just how it is.
1013240	1018600	But this person has decided that she's simply just going to walk in a direct line from where
1018600	1020920	she is to where she's going.
1020920	1024280	And if there's a man in her way, that man's going to have to go around her.
1024280	1027460	A few days ago, I was having a bad morning.
1027460	1032740	My train tickets were expensive, my train was delayed, and my coffee was cold.
1032740	1035680	But I cheered myself up by playing a game on my commute.
1035680	1039700	The game is called patriarchy chicken, and the rules are simple.
1039700	1042120	Do not move out of the way for men.
1042120	1047220	How much of an asshole do you have to be to actually do this?
1047220	1052200	Everybody on a commute moves out of the way of somebody at some point.
1052200	1054340	Sometimes people move out of the way of you.
1054340	1056660	Sometimes you move out of the way of other people.
1056660	1059780	Somebody is like dancing around and slithering their way through the crowd.
1059780	1061320	That's just how it is.
1061320	1067060	And those few people, who are yeah usually men, who don't move out of the way for anybody?
1067060	1068900	They're assholes.
1068900	1072800	It's not a patriarchy thing, it's a them being a dick thing.
1072800	1074660	And most men aren't that.
1074660	1077860	If you're a woman, you find yourself constantly dodging.
1077860	1081060	No if you're a person, you find yourself constantly dodging.
1081060	1085360	Side-stepping men who are walking in your direction, being wiped out by a wheely suitcase
1085360	1091180	dragged by a bee-suited man, moving to the side to let faster men past you, or just pausing
1091180	1095700	to let men bustle in front of you onto the train, or into the lift, or onto the escalator,
1095700	1099260	and on with their busy lives to their important jobs.
1099260	1102900	You sound kind of bitter that your life isn't busy or important.
1102900	1105940	If you don't move out of the way of men, your commute changes.
1105940	1110260	For one thing, I'm not going to lie about this, you do collide with a lot of men.
1110260	1112580	This is where the name of the game comes from.
1112580	1115200	You need to really commit to patriarchy chicken.
1115200	1118660	Don't let your social instinct to step to the side kick in.
1118660	1120420	Men are going to walk into you.
1120420	1122020	That isn't your fault.
1122020	1126060	It sounds more like you're going to walk into men, and that would be your fault.
1126060	1130100	The point of patriarchy chicken is not just that you get to where you're going marginally
1130100	1135420	faster, although you do, or that you irritate a number of men, which you also do.
1135420	1140860	The point is that men have been socialized for their entire lives to take up space.
1140860	1144500	Men who would never express these thoughts out loud have nevertheless been brought up
1144500	1148760	to believe that their right to occupy space takes precedent over anyone else's right
1148760	1150020	to be there.
1150020	1154240	They spread their legs on the tubes and trains, they bellow across coffee shops and guffaw
1154240	1157380	in pubs, and they never ever give way.
1157380	1159600	Men spread their legs because they have balls.
1159600	1164560	The few men that bellow across coffee shops are assholes, and everyone who guffaws in
1164560	1168600	a pub is having a good time, which is what they're there for.
1168600	1177920	And if you actually think that all men, all 3.5 billion of us, never, ever give way, ever,
1177920	1179760	you're fucking delusional.
1179760	1182660	Women have not been socialized to take up space.
1182660	1186420	Women have been socialized to give way, to alleviate, to conciliate, and to step to the
1186420	1187420	side.
1187420	1190020	This is so ingrained that we don't even think about it.
1190020	1194740	We might stand up in meetings and make our point, even when we know a man will take the
1194740	1195740	credit.
1195740	1200280	We might dutifully delete the exclamation marks from our emails so as not to undermine
1200280	1203300	ourselves, but we will still step to the side.
1203300	1208320	This sounds like you have a self-confidence issue, which does tie in neatly to your earlier
1208320	1211680	petty remarks about men having busy lives.
1211680	1215280	I am an able-bodied 5'6 white woman.
1215280	1217840	I move through this world with a lot of privilege.
1217840	1224960	Well, okay, maybe, maybe you should step to the side as an able-bodied 5.6 white woman
1224960	1230440	because at some point, you're not going to step to the side when it comes to the wrong
1230440	1234820	person and you will no longer be able-bodied, you will be run the fuck over.
1234820	1239460	And let's be honest, the main reason you have the gall to actually try this is because
1239460	1244280	you live in a Western country where most men are cognizant of the fact that they're larger
1244280	1248940	than women, they're stronger than women, and that if they bump into a woman, the woman
1248940	1253000	is much more likely to be seriously hurt than they are.
1253000	1257120	So while there are a minority of assholes who will plow through a crowd, most of them
1257120	1262840	will see you marching in a straight line and specifically try to avoid hurting you because
1262840	1264760	they're actually decent people.
1264760	1270540	If you were to do this in, say, a large city in the third world somewhere, you know, an
1270540	1275140	actual patriarchal shithole, but a place that is at least advanced enough to have some kind
1275140	1281440	of transit system, you will find yourself constantly being knocked to the ground because
1281440	1283360	nobody will give a shit about you.
1283360	1289800	The fact that you can play patriarchy chicken and not be seriously hurt constantly shows
1289800	1292700	that you don't actually live in a patriarchy.
1292700	1297240	Let's finish it off with Stop Shaming Me for Taking a Photo with Tucker Carlson at a Funeral.
1297240	1299260	This is written by Christina Pereira.
1299260	1305460	She's a sex worker who used to work at one of Nevada's legal brothels and apparently
1305460	1309420	legal brothel owner Dennis Hoff recently died.
1309420	1313740	And both her and Tucker Carlson were at the funeral since they were both both friends
1313740	1314740	of this guy.
1314740	1317580	I woke up Saturday to a concerned text from my friend.
1317580	1321440	I logged on to Twitter to see what fresh hell awaited me.
1321440	1327540	And there it was a tweet from Kate Arthur, the chief Los Angeles correspondent for BuzzFeed
1327540	1332000	News featuring a photo of me and Tucker Carlson that I had posted.
1332000	1336440	Her tweet read, Remember Tucker Carlson's lecture during the height of family separation
1336440	1340240	in June about how the left doesn't care about family values?
1340240	1344680	Well, I'm not one to kink shame, but here he is with a sex worker.
1344680	1346200	Go Tucker.
1346200	1352400	And then it quotes Christina's two tweets saying tuck and hookers pass on cooties.
1352400	1353400	It's true.
1353400	1354720	And then there's the two of them.
1354720	1360720	The Christina, our author Christina and Tucker Carlson having a cute moment in the photo.
1360720	1363520	I'm playfully kissing him on the cheek as he turns away laughing.
1363520	1365160	And that really is all that it seems to be.
1365160	1367460	But let's examine this for a minute.
1367460	1375720	The Federalist, the Federalist is publishing an article by a sex worker defending sex workers.
1375720	1380520	And Tucker Carlson, a high profile conservative news anchor is completely fine with posing
1380520	1383120	publicly with a sex worker.
1383120	1389900	Meanwhile, it's BuzzFeed that is shaming sex work, shaming sex workers and shaming the
1389900	1395100	men who lawfully casually interact with them in a non-sexual setting.
1395100	1396780	What the fuck has happened to us?
1396780	1401780	What happened that this insane reversal has taken place that the left are now the sexual
1401780	1406020	prudes that want to censor everything and the right are the free spirits?
1406020	1407020	How did this happen?
1407020	1408980	Like, look at Kate Arthur's tweet.
1408980	1413740	Well, I'm not one to kink shame, but here he is with a sex worker.
1413740	1418820	See, everything that you say before the word but doesn't matter.
1418820	1420560	You are one to kink shame.
1420560	1422400	That is what your tweet is.
1422400	1429100	It's kink shaming Tucker for not even anything kinky, just being friendly with a sex worker.
1429100	1431380	Having an acquaintance who's a sex worker.
1431380	1432800	That's something to report on.
1432800	1434540	That's something to slander somebody with.
1434540	1437580	And this is not from the religious right.
1437580	1438900	BuzzFeed's not the religious right.
1438900	1440660	Kate Arthur's not the religious right.
1440660	1442700	This is from the social justice warriors.
1442700	1447020	There was nothing scandalous or inappropriate about this moment with Carlson.
1447020	1450980	It was a celebrity taking a few minutes out of his day to make a fan feel good.
1450980	1455020	I approached Tucker and told him what a huge fan I was and he was kind enough to say yes
1455020	1456020	to a photo.
1456020	1458540	It was nothing more and nothing less.
1458540	1460820	When I offered to buy him a drink, he declined.
1460820	1463080	He had a club soda instead.
1463080	1467380	I sat with Tucker and Mitchell and we shared stories about our late friend.
1467380	1471140	We were three people from diverse backgrounds coming together to remember a man who touched
1471140	1472780	all of our lives.
1472780	1475640	I asked Mitchell if he would take a photo of Tucker and I.
1475840	1480640	After taking the first silly one that Arthur irresponsibly grasped onto, we took a second
1480640	1483880	normal photo, both smiling and facing the camera.
1483880	1485000	And there you have it.
1485000	1489360	This is the kind of thing that you would expect, you know, like religious church-going moral
1489360	1494200	busybodies to latch onto in order to try and get somebody fired from their jaws because
1494200	1499560	oh, a detail of their sexual life has come out even though it's not really that sexual.
1499560	1500800	It looks bad, guys.
1500800	1501980	It looks bad.
1501980	1504000	But this isn't the religious right.
1504200	1506160	The moral busybodies are coming from social justice.
1506160	1508040	They're coming from the radical left.
1508040	1512480	I hope this episode serves as a lesson to Arthur and her ilk, but I doubt it.
1512480	1517540	She immediately blocked me when I attempted to explain the circumstances.
1517540	1521780	We deserve better from journalists and I am getting tired of one fake news hit pieced
1521780	1522920	after another.
1522920	1526260	This is why people hate journalism now.
1526260	1528640	This is why journalists are not trusted.
1528640	1531380	It's not because of Trump screaming about fake news.
1531380	1537900	It's because you guys act so reprehensibly, so horrifically disgusting that nobody wants
1537900	1540500	to give you the benefit of the doubt anymore.
1540500	1543780	Journalists today are so entitled, so egotistical.
1543780	1548020	They are single-handedly destroying the fourth estate and we're all worse off for it.
1548020	1552120	We need a robust system of journalism and these people aren't providing it.
1552120	1553660	They're fucking raping it into the ground.
1553660	1555580	All right, my chums, that's the end of it for me.
1555580	1556580	Thank you very much.
1556580	1562340	Post links in the description to those alternate channels and those ways to support the channel
1562340	1566100	if you do feel like partaking in any of those things I talked about at the start of the
1566100	1567100	video.
1567100	1571300	If you do, thank you very much for your support and even if you don't, thanks for being here.
1571300	1573780	There's no obligation to do any of the stuff that I outlined.
1573780	1577460	Just being here and hanging out and watching the videos are enough.
1577460	1580100	I truly do appreciate each and every single one of you.
1580100	1582060	All right, my friends, I will see you next time.
