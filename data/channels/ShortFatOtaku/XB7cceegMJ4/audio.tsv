0	3360	Real quick before we begin, did you know my community has a Minecraft server?
3360	5760	In the next week or so I'm going to be opening the first challenge map,
5760	7920	so if that sort of thing interests you, get on in there,
7920	9680	the IP address is in the description of the video.
15440	19040	In the last video, I talked about the study that Jonathan Haidt worked on,
19040	21600	ideological differences in the expanse of the moral circle,
21600	25440	and how we were going to put aside the obvious implications of it for another time.
25440	27520	Well, today is the other time.
27520	31680	As a quick recap, the study showed that, on average, left-leaning people care more
31680	35280	about large-scale ideas and entities beyond their immediate scope,
35280	38480	while right-leaning people care more about those individuals around them.
38480	42480	And this difference doesn't manifest in such a way that left-leaning people have more total
42480	46480	consideration than right-leaning people, and therefore can afford to spread it around to
46480	50000	wider areas of concern, while not sacrificing those close to them.
50000	52240	As shown by that awfully damning heatmap,
52240	56480	when leftoids and rightoids both have the same amount of moral units to spread around,
56480	60640	rightoids are likely to prioritize their family and friends over more esoteric targets like
60640	64880	plants, trees, amoeba, and space rocks, while with leftoids it's the inverse.
64880	68560	Yes, your average leftist cares more about amoeba than their families and friends.
68560	71120	That just sounds sociopathic to me.
71120	72720	That heatmap is Figure 5.
72720	76800	Figure 1 shows that right-leaning people prefer friends, then family, then others,
76800	79680	while left-leaning people prefer others, then friends, then family.
79680	83440	Figure 2 shows that right-leaning people prefer nationalism over universalism,
83440	84880	and left-leaning people the opposite.
84880	89840	Figure 3 shows that left-leaning people identify first with humanity, then community, then country,
89840	93760	while right-leaning people identify first with country, then community, then humanity.
93760	98800	Figure 4 shows that the most extreme of leftists prefer non-human entities to human ones,
98800	103920	and everybody else, even non-extreme but still solidly left leftists, prefer humans,
103920	106320	though the gap gets wider the more right you go.
106320	110160	If we were to boil down a general rule out of these bits of information,
110160	114160	it would be that progressives prefer universalized, high-minded concepts,
114160	116480	and they allocate their moral consideration accordingly,
116480	119440	towards large, encompassing classes of things,
119440	122560	while conservatives prefer localized, grounded concepts,
122560	126160	and they also allocate their moral consideration accordingly, towards individuals,
126160	129920	but not just random individuals, but those individuals that they're close to.
129920	133520	All that being said, it still remains to be seen which of these approaches is correct.
133520	135520	I'd guess that the answer is, it depends.
135520	138640	Is it possible that the leftist view is too ivory tower,
138640	141280	too disconnected from reality and the people living within it,
141360	144720	and the rightists are grounded and practical and more connected to others?
144720	145440	Absolutely.
145440	149920	Is it also possible that the leftist view is necessary when tackling large-scale complex
149920	153600	problems, while the rightists are too lost in the forest to see the trees?
154160	155520	Again, absolutely.
155520	158560	If you're living in a local community of trusted family members and friends,
158560	160640	and allocating your moral consideration accordingly,
160640	162720	then the localist view might be correct,
162720	165840	and the universalist would likely come in the form of some city slicker
165840	167920	who doesn't know a lick about you or your community,
167920	170400	flying in to mess things up out of ignorance,
170400	172240	thinking his ways work everywhere.
172240	174720	At the same time, if you're the leader of a government,
174720	178160	and you need to muddle your way through to the correct path while still representing
178160	181600	vast swaths of people who may not agree with each other let alone you,
181600	185680	while still getting the job done on a project that is simply too big to go it alone?
185680	188560	In this case, the more universalist view might be correct,
188560	191600	and the localist would likely be the small-minded country bumpkin
191600	194560	who only cares about his concerns and wants to see them fulfilled,
194560	197360	even if it's at the cost of somebody else somewhere else,
198320	200880	because their perspective doesn't allow them to see that cost,
200880	202160	or even care about it.
202160	205360	The point is, I'm not passing judgement on which position is correct here,
205360	207920	except when it comes to valuing space rocks over humans,
207920	209120	fuck you commies.
209120	211040	And yet, despite all of this,
211040	214880	how often do you see leftists try to appeal to the community in their rhetoric?
214880	215760	The black community?
215760	217120	The BIPOC community?
217120	218080	The trans community?
218080	220080	The LGBTQ plus community?
220080	222560	All of their rhetoric centers around the community,
222560	225440	because they want to appear to be localists against the oppressive,
225440	227040	tyrannical globalist corpos.
227120	229840	It's the internationalists who have no stake in anything,
229840	231600	flying in to rape and extract,
231600	234880	versus the local community of tight-knit leftists who are fighting the good fight.
234880	238160	The problem is, this view doesn't map onto reality.
238160	240880	There is no trans community, or gay community.
240880	244400	There are trans and gay individuals, but they are more different than similar.
244400	246000	They don't all live in the same area,
246000	247920	nor do they advocate for the same politics,
247920	249920	nor do they have the same concerns.
249920	251520	It's a superficial construction,
251520	254560	not based on the voluntary association of the people involved,
254560	259360	but rather based on one single immutable data point in their personality.
259360	261760	In other words, just because you're gay or trans,
261760	264640	doesn't mean you are like every other gay or trans person.
264640	266560	It doesn't mean that you exist in a community.
266560	269040	Compare that with the conservative definition of community,
269040	270480	which is a lot more clear cut.
270480	272320	Their family, their friends, their neighbors.
272320	274560	Deep, consensual interpersonal ties,
274560	276880	of a group of people who all live in the same area.
276880	278160	This is a community,
278160	281040	and rightists often have this while leftists don't.
281040	284640	Even in those instances where there is an identifiable physical community,
284640	286960	like a neighborhood where predominantly black people live,
286960	290720	unless there's some sense of belonging, of togetherness, of community,
290720	292080	then there's not a community there.
292080	294640	And for sure, some black neighborhoods in the states have this,
294640	296160	and a lot of others do not.
296160	298560	Asian and Latino neighborhoods are far more likely to,
298560	301280	which is why it makes a lot more sense to call them communities.
301280	305440	Progressives wield the community in order to gain a lot of leverage.
305440	308160	If you want to cancel somebody but there's no concrete allegations,
308160	309920	well, he's insulting the community,
309920	312560	even if we can't find an individual who's actually bothered.
312560	314800	If you want to force through some bit of policy,
314800	317520	whether that's legislation or terms of service or whatever,
317520	319440	well, it's good for the community,
319440	321440	even if you can't find any actual benefit.
321440	324640	And the thing is, they're not able to stop themselves.
324640	328480	The entirety of the left at this point sits atop a foundation of socialism.
328480	332000	Even if we're talking about some idiot rad femme who only cares about women's issues,
332000	335040	or some intersectional progressive who doesn't actually care about Marx,
335040	336160	if you dig deeply enough,
336160	339440	the progressive lens eventually discovers working class versus the rich
339440	340560	as a vector of oppression,
340560	343760	and their logic inevitably leads them to socialism's class war.
343760	346080	And because it's all some variant of socialism,
346080	348880	it's always going to be collectivist, not individualist.
348880	353440	The only real moral weight socialist rhetoric has is in its appeal to the collective,
353440	356800	the community, communal ownership, communal living, communal thinking.
356800	361120	So progressives can never actually appeal to gay individuals or trans individuals.
361120	364560	They can only craft non-existent communities and appeal to those.
364560	366080	We've got to coin a phrase,
366080	367440	Dev's Law or something,
367440	371600	because I've gone back to Marx's On the Jewish Question too many times in this channel.
371600	375920	If you need to understand why Marxism explicitly rejects the liberal right to free association,
375920	380080	which is the foundation of why they force people into these fake communities,
380080	381840	then you have to read this essay.
381840	386720	In it, Marx complains that the liberal conception of rights leaves man an isolated monad,
386720	390240	turned inward toward his own property, his own endeavors, and his own troubles,
390240	392560	while freedom is found through our connections to others.
392560	396400	And while Marx is correct, freedom can be found through our connections to others.
396400	398800	That's only if such a connection is voluntary.
398800	403280	The Marxist criticism of liberal rights is that they don't allow people to be connected together.
403280	404720	But we don't need a right for that.
404720	406160	If you want to do that, we'll do it.
406160	410640	The natural end result of Marx's complaint is that in the Marxist conception of rights,
410640	415040	one person will be allowed to force a connection with another due to his right to be connected.
415040	417520	Again, socialists don't understand consent.
417520	420160	As these people appeal to this mythical community,
420160	422720	they reject what actually being a part of community is.
422720	424720	That's why they want to abolish the family,
424720	428080	or they believe that everybody has terrible relationships with their family just because
428080	432320	they do, or why they're known for treating other human beings like such utter garbage
432320	435920	for the most trivial of reasons, or why they're so afraid that coronavirus
435920	438160	lockdowns have turned people they know wholesome.
438160	440800	Hold on, you guys keep talking about the community,
440800	444320	and now that women are becoming more community-oriented, it's suddenly a big problem?
444320	448160	Even worse, now that the power of appealing to the community has been recognized,
448160	450880	we've started to see new revisions of that idea crop up.
450880	455200	Have you happened to notice appeals to the international community or the global community
455200	457040	in the name of all sorts of causes?
457040	461760	The fundamental problem with all of this is that this just isn't what a community is.
461760	465920	It doesn't need to be mono-ethnic or monoracial or monoreligious, though that can obviously help,
465920	470080	but your community is the people around you that you voluntarily choose to associate with.
470080	472480	And as the study at the beginning of this video showed,
472480	476080	leftists do not value their communities while rightists do.
476080	480720	No matter how many mucho texto comics they write about how as queer POCs,
480720	485360	they need to rediscover a new anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist definition of family ties
485360	488800	and blah blah blah, and they're literally just talking about having friends.
488800	494000	However, while it's true that leftists don't value community, they also don't really need to.
494000	495840	They only need to appeal to it.
495840	499040	As long as they can identify themselves as the voice of the community,
499040	502160	that's the wedge in the door to introduce unwanted bureaucracy.
502160	506160	Now the trans community is not simply random trans people who are disconnected,
506160	509840	but somebody who speaks for it, and that somebody now runs an organization,
509840	514000	and that organization now lobbies politicians, collects donations, and silences critics,
514000	516960	even among those very trans people it should be representing.
516960	520880	The first thing I think is that we actually do have an ideological frame.
520880	524400	Myself and Alicia in particular are trained organizers.
525760	528560	We are trained Marxists.
529520	539600	We are super versed on sort of ideological theories,
539600	542800	and I think that what we really try to do is build a movement
542800	545440	that could be utilized by many, many black folk.
546000	548400	If you can label it, then you can centralize it.
548400	551200	And if you can centralize it, then you can gatekeep and subvert it.
551200	555520	The only way to fight back against this is to force them to keep things particular.
555760	559600	Don't let anyone get away with broad sweeping allegations or demands.
559600	562000	Don't consent to give your voice to their efforts.
562000	565600	Don't talk about things on their terms or agree to their terminology.
565600	570000	And always make sure to laugh at them so that they'll expose themselves as the tyrants they are.
570000	572560	These people don't care about any community.
572560	574960	They are anathema to the very concept of it.
574960	577360	And if they're coming for a community that you're a part of,
577360	578800	then you have an obligation to defend it.
579440	581120	Alright guys, that about does it for me.
581120	583760	You are correct in assuming that there's no Weekly Sip this week,
583760	585600	and instead you're getting this video.
585600	588960	I'm trying really hard to get back into the content creation saddle.
588960	591760	I don't like going weeks without making videos anymore,
591760	593520	so I'm just going to focus on this for a bit.
593520	598480	As always, please consider checking out the evening Twitch streams at twitch.tv slash gameboomers.
598480	601280	Hop into the Minecraft server if that tickles your fancy.
601280	603280	And I will see you next time.
603280	604320	I love you.
