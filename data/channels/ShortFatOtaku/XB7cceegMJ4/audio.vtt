00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
Real quick before we begin, did you know my community has a Minecraft server?

00:03.360 --> 00:05.760
In the next week or so I'm going to be opening the first challenge map,

00:05.760 --> 00:07.920
so if that sort of thing interests you, get on in there,

00:07.920 --> 00:09.680
the IP address is in the description of the video.

00:15.440 --> 00:19.040
In the last video, I talked about the study that Jonathan Haidt worked on,

00:19.040 --> 00:21.600
ideological differences in the expanse of the moral circle,

00:21.600 --> 00:25.440
and how we were going to put aside the obvious implications of it for another time.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.520
Well, today is the other time.

00:27.520 --> 00:31.680
As a quick recap, the study showed that, on average, left-leaning people care more

00:31.680 --> 00:35.280
about large-scale ideas and entities beyond their immediate scope,

00:35.280 --> 00:38.480
while right-leaning people care more about those individuals around them.

00:38.480 --> 00:42.480
And this difference doesn't manifest in such a way that left-leaning people have more total

00:42.480 --> 00:46.480
consideration than right-leaning people, and therefore can afford to spread it around to

00:46.480 --> 00:50.000
wider areas of concern, while not sacrificing those close to them.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.240
As shown by that awfully damning heatmap,

00:52.240 --> 00:56.480
when leftoids and rightoids both have the same amount of moral units to spread around,

00:56.480 --> 01:00.640
rightoids are likely to prioritize their family and friends over more esoteric targets like

01:00.640 --> 01:04.880
plants, trees, amoeba, and space rocks, while with leftoids it's the inverse.

01:04.880 --> 01:08.560
Yes, your average leftist cares more about amoeba than their families and friends.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.120
That just sounds sociopathic to me.

01:11.120 --> 01:12.720
That heatmap is Figure 5.

01:12.720 --> 01:16.800
Figure 1 shows that right-leaning people prefer friends, then family, then others,

01:16.800 --> 01:19.680
while left-leaning people prefer others, then friends, then family.

01:19.680 --> 01:23.440
Figure 2 shows that right-leaning people prefer nationalism over universalism,

01:23.440 --> 01:24.880
and left-leaning people the opposite.

01:24.880 --> 01:29.840
Figure 3 shows that left-leaning people identify first with humanity, then community, then country,

01:29.840 --> 01:33.760
while right-leaning people identify first with country, then community, then humanity.

01:33.760 --> 01:38.800
Figure 4 shows that the most extreme of leftists prefer non-human entities to human ones,

01:38.800 --> 01:43.920
and everybody else, even non-extreme but still solidly left leftists, prefer humans,

01:43.920 --> 01:46.320
though the gap gets wider the more right you go.

01:46.320 --> 01:50.160
If we were to boil down a general rule out of these bits of information,

01:50.160 --> 01:54.160
it would be that progressives prefer universalized, high-minded concepts,

01:54.160 --> 01:56.480
and they allocate their moral consideration accordingly,

01:56.480 --> 01:59.440
towards large, encompassing classes of things,

01:59.440 --> 02:02.560
while conservatives prefer localized, grounded concepts,

02:02.560 --> 02:06.160
and they also allocate their moral consideration accordingly, towards individuals,

02:06.160 --> 02:09.920
but not just random individuals, but those individuals that they're close to.

02:09.920 --> 02:13.520
All that being said, it still remains to be seen which of these approaches is correct.

02:13.520 --> 02:15.520
I'd guess that the answer is, it depends.

02:15.520 --> 02:18.640
Is it possible that the leftist view is too ivory tower,

02:18.640 --> 02:21.280
too disconnected from reality and the people living within it,

02:21.360 --> 02:24.720
and the rightists are grounded and practical and more connected to others?

02:24.720 --> 02:25.440
Absolutely.

02:25.440 --> 02:29.920
Is it also possible that the leftist view is necessary when tackling large-scale complex

02:29.920 --> 02:33.600
problems, while the rightists are too lost in the forest to see the trees?

02:34.160 --> 02:35.520
Again, absolutely.

02:35.520 --> 02:38.560
If you're living in a local community of trusted family members and friends,

02:38.560 --> 02:40.640
and allocating your moral consideration accordingly,

02:40.640 --> 02:42.720
then the localist view might be correct,

02:42.720 --> 02:45.840
and the universalist would likely come in the form of some city slicker

02:45.840 --> 02:47.920
who doesn't know a lick about you or your community,

02:47.920 --> 02:50.400
flying in to mess things up out of ignorance,

02:50.400 --> 02:52.240
thinking his ways work everywhere.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.720
At the same time, if you're the leader of a government,

02:54.720 --> 02:58.160
and you need to muddle your way through to the correct path while still representing

02:58.160 --> 03:01.600
vast swaths of people who may not agree with each other let alone you,

03:01.600 --> 03:05.680
while still getting the job done on a project that is simply too big to go it alone?

03:05.680 --> 03:08.560
In this case, the more universalist view might be correct,

03:08.560 --> 03:11.600
and the localist would likely be the small-minded country bumpkin

03:11.600 --> 03:14.560
who only cares about his concerns and wants to see them fulfilled,

03:14.560 --> 03:17.360
even if it's at the cost of somebody else somewhere else,

03:18.320 --> 03:20.880
because their perspective doesn't allow them to see that cost,

03:20.880 --> 03:22.160
or even care about it.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.360
The point is, I'm not passing judgement on which position is correct here,

03:25.360 --> 03:27.920
except when it comes to valuing space rocks over humans,

03:27.920 --> 03:29.120
fuck you commies.

03:29.120 --> 03:31.040
And yet, despite all of this,

03:31.040 --> 03:34.880
how often do you see leftists try to appeal to the community in their rhetoric?

03:34.880 --> 03:35.760
The black community?

03:35.760 --> 03:37.120
The BIPOC community?

03:37.120 --> 03:38.080
The trans community?

03:38.080 --> 03:40.080
The LGBTQ plus community?

03:40.080 --> 03:42.560
All of their rhetoric centers around the community,

03:42.560 --> 03:45.440
because they want to appear to be localists against the oppressive,

03:45.440 --> 03:47.040
tyrannical globalist corpos.

03:47.120 --> 03:49.840
It's the internationalists who have no stake in anything,

03:49.840 --> 03:51.600
flying in to rape and extract,

03:51.600 --> 03:54.880
versus the local community of tight-knit leftists who are fighting the good fight.

03:54.880 --> 03:58.160
The problem is, this view doesn't map onto reality.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.880
There is no trans community, or gay community.

04:00.880 --> 04:04.400
There are trans and gay individuals, but they are more different than similar.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.000
They don't all live in the same area,

04:06.000 --> 04:07.920
nor do they advocate for the same politics,

04:07.920 --> 04:09.920
nor do they have the same concerns.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.520
It's a superficial construction,

04:11.520 --> 04:14.560
not based on the voluntary association of the people involved,

04:14.560 --> 04:19.360
but rather based on one single immutable data point in their personality.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.760
In other words, just because you're gay or trans,

04:21.760 --> 04:24.640
doesn't mean you are like every other gay or trans person.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.560
It doesn't mean that you exist in a community.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.040
Compare that with the conservative definition of community,

04:29.040 --> 04:30.480
which is a lot more clear cut.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.320
Their family, their friends, their neighbors.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.560
Deep, consensual interpersonal ties,

04:34.560 --> 04:36.880
of a group of people who all live in the same area.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.160
This is a community,

04:38.160 --> 04:41.040
and rightists often have this while leftists don't.

04:41.040 --> 04:44.640
Even in those instances where there is an identifiable physical community,

04:44.640 --> 04:46.960
like a neighborhood where predominantly black people live,

04:46.960 --> 04:50.720
unless there's some sense of belonging, of togetherness, of community,

04:50.720 --> 04:52.080
then there's not a community there.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.640
And for sure, some black neighborhoods in the states have this,

04:54.640 --> 04:56.160
and a lot of others do not.

04:56.160 --> 04:58.560
Asian and Latino neighborhoods are far more likely to,

04:58.560 --> 05:01.280
which is why it makes a lot more sense to call them communities.

05:01.280 --> 05:05.440
Progressives wield the community in order to gain a lot of leverage.

05:05.440 --> 05:08.160
If you want to cancel somebody but there's no concrete allegations,

05:08.160 --> 05:09.920
well, he's insulting the community,

05:09.920 --> 05:12.560
even if we can't find an individual who's actually bothered.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.800
If you want to force through some bit of policy,

05:14.800 --> 05:17.520
whether that's legislation or terms of service or whatever,

05:17.520 --> 05:19.440
well, it's good for the community,

05:19.440 --> 05:21.440
even if you can't find any actual benefit.

05:21.440 --> 05:24.640
And the thing is, they're not able to stop themselves.

05:24.640 --> 05:28.480
The entirety of the left at this point sits atop a foundation of socialism.

05:28.480 --> 05:32.000
Even if we're talking about some idiot rad femme who only cares about women's issues,

05:32.000 --> 05:35.040
or some intersectional progressive who doesn't actually care about Marx,

05:35.040 --> 05:36.160
if you dig deeply enough,

05:36.160 --> 05:39.440
the progressive lens eventually discovers working class versus the rich

05:39.440 --> 05:40.560
as a vector of oppression,

05:40.560 --> 05:43.760
and their logic inevitably leads them to socialism's class war.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.080
And because it's all some variant of socialism,

05:46.080 --> 05:48.880
it's always going to be collectivist, not individualist.

05:48.880 --> 05:53.440
The only real moral weight socialist rhetoric has is in its appeal to the collective,

05:53.440 --> 05:56.800
the community, communal ownership, communal living, communal thinking.

05:56.800 --> 06:01.120
So progressives can never actually appeal to gay individuals or trans individuals.

06:01.120 --> 06:04.560
They can only craft non-existent communities and appeal to those.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.080
We've got to coin a phrase,

06:06.080 --> 06:07.440
Dev's Law or something,

06:07.440 --> 06:11.600
because I've gone back to Marx's On the Jewish Question too many times in this channel.

06:11.600 --> 06:15.920
If you need to understand why Marxism explicitly rejects the liberal right to free association,

06:15.920 --> 06:20.080
which is the foundation of why they force people into these fake communities,

06:20.080 --> 06:21.840
then you have to read this essay.

06:21.840 --> 06:26.720
In it, Marx complains that the liberal conception of rights leaves man an isolated monad,

06:26.720 --> 06:30.240
turned inward toward his own property, his own endeavors, and his own troubles,

06:30.240 --> 06:32.560
while freedom is found through our connections to others.

06:32.560 --> 06:36.400
And while Marx is correct, freedom can be found through our connections to others.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.800
That's only if such a connection is voluntary.

06:38.800 --> 06:43.280
The Marxist criticism of liberal rights is that they don't allow people to be connected together.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.720
But we don't need a right for that.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.160
If you want to do that, we'll do it.

06:46.160 --> 06:50.640
The natural end result of Marx's complaint is that in the Marxist conception of rights,

06:50.640 --> 06:55.040
one person will be allowed to force a connection with another due to his right to be connected.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.520
Again, socialists don't understand consent.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.160
As these people appeal to this mythical community,

07:00.160 --> 07:02.720
they reject what actually being a part of community is.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.720
That's why they want to abolish the family,

07:04.720 --> 07:08.080
or they believe that everybody has terrible relationships with their family just because

07:08.080 --> 07:12.320
they do, or why they're known for treating other human beings like such utter garbage

07:12.320 --> 07:15.920
for the most trivial of reasons, or why they're so afraid that coronavirus

07:15.920 --> 07:18.160
lockdowns have turned people they know wholesome.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.800
Hold on, you guys keep talking about the community,

07:20.800 --> 07:24.320
and now that women are becoming more community-oriented, it's suddenly a big problem?

07:24.320 --> 07:28.160
Even worse, now that the power of appealing to the community has been recognized,

07:28.160 --> 07:30.880
we've started to see new revisions of that idea crop up.

07:30.880 --> 07:35.200
Have you happened to notice appeals to the international community or the global community

07:35.200 --> 07:37.040
in the name of all sorts of causes?

07:37.040 --> 07:41.760
The fundamental problem with all of this is that this just isn't what a community is.

07:41.760 --> 07:45.920
It doesn't need to be mono-ethnic or monoracial or monoreligious, though that can obviously help,

07:45.920 --> 07:50.080
but your community is the people around you that you voluntarily choose to associate with.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.480
And as the study at the beginning of this video showed,

07:52.480 --> 07:56.080
leftists do not value their communities while rightists do.

07:56.080 --> 08:00.720
No matter how many mucho texto comics they write about how as queer POCs,

08:00.720 --> 08:05.360
they need to rediscover a new anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist definition of family ties

08:05.360 --> 08:08.800
and blah blah blah, and they're literally just talking about having friends.

08:08.800 --> 08:14.000
However, while it's true that leftists don't value community, they also don't really need to.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.840
They only need to appeal to it.

08:15.840 --> 08:19.040
As long as they can identify themselves as the voice of the community,

08:19.040 --> 08:22.160
that's the wedge in the door to introduce unwanted bureaucracy.

08:22.160 --> 08:26.160
Now the trans community is not simply random trans people who are disconnected,

08:26.160 --> 08:29.840
but somebody who speaks for it, and that somebody now runs an organization,

08:29.840 --> 08:34.000
and that organization now lobbies politicians, collects donations, and silences critics,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.960
even among those very trans people it should be representing.

08:36.960 --> 08:40.880
The first thing I think is that we actually do have an ideological frame.

08:40.880 --> 08:44.400
Myself and Alicia in particular are trained organizers.

08:45.760 --> 08:48.560
We are trained Marxists.

08:49.520 --> 08:59.600
We are super versed on sort of ideological theories,

08:59.600 --> 09:02.800
and I think that what we really try to do is build a movement

09:02.800 --> 09:05.440
that could be utilized by many, many black folk.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.400
If you can label it, then you can centralize it.

09:08.400 --> 09:11.200
And if you can centralize it, then you can gatekeep and subvert it.

09:11.200 --> 09:15.520
The only way to fight back against this is to force them to keep things particular.

09:15.760 --> 09:19.600
Don't let anyone get away with broad sweeping allegations or demands.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.000
Don't consent to give your voice to their efforts.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.600
Don't talk about things on their terms or agree to their terminology.

09:25.600 --> 09:30.000
And always make sure to laugh at them so that they'll expose themselves as the tyrants they are.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.560
These people don't care about any community.

09:32.560 --> 09:34.960
They are anathema to the very concept of it.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.360
And if they're coming for a community that you're a part of,

09:37.360 --> 09:38.800
then you have an obligation to defend it.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.120
Alright guys, that about does it for me.

09:41.120 --> 09:43.760
You are correct in assuming that there's no Weekly Sip this week,

09:43.760 --> 09:45.600
and instead you're getting this video.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.960
I'm trying really hard to get back into the content creation saddle.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.760
I don't like going weeks without making videos anymore,

09:51.760 --> 09:53.520
so I'm just going to focus on this for a bit.

09:53.520 --> 09:58.480
As always, please consider checking out the evening Twitch streams at twitch.tv slash gameboomers.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.280
Hop into the Minecraft server if that tickles your fancy.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.280
And I will see you next time.

10:03.280 --> 10:04.320
I love you.
