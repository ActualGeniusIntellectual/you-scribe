1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Real quick before we begin, did you know my community has a Minecraft server?

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,760
In the next week or so I'm going to be opening the first challenge map,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,920
so if that sort of thing interests you, get on in there,

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,680
the IP address is in the description of the video.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,040
In the last video, I talked about the study that Jonathan Haidt worked on,

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,600
ideological differences in the expanse of the moral circle,

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,440
and how we were going to put aside the obvious implications of it for another time.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,520
Well, today is the other time.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,680
As a quick recap, the study showed that, on average, left-leaning people care more

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,280
about large-scale ideas and entities beyond their immediate scope,

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,480
while right-leaning people care more about those individuals around them.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,480
And this difference doesn't manifest in such a way that left-leaning people have more total

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,480
consideration than right-leaning people, and therefore can afford to spread it around to

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,000
wider areas of concern, while not sacrificing those close to them.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,240
As shown by that awfully damning heatmap,

16
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,480
when leftoids and rightoids both have the same amount of moral units to spread around,

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,640
rightoids are likely to prioritize their family and friends over more esoteric targets like

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,880
plants, trees, amoeba, and space rocks, while with leftoids it's the inverse.

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,560
Yes, your average leftist cares more about amoeba than their families and friends.

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,120
That just sounds sociopathic to me.

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,720
That heatmap is Figure 5.

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,800
Figure 1 shows that right-leaning people prefer friends, then family, then others,

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,680
while left-leaning people prefer others, then friends, then family.

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,440
Figure 2 shows that right-leaning people prefer nationalism over universalism,

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,880
and left-leaning people the opposite.

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,840
Figure 3 shows that left-leaning people identify first with humanity, then community, then country,

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,760
while right-leaning people identify first with country, then community, then humanity.

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,800
Figure 4 shows that the most extreme of leftists prefer non-human entities to human ones,

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,920
and everybody else, even non-extreme but still solidly left leftists, prefer humans,

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,320
though the gap gets wider the more right you go.

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,160
If we were to boil down a general rule out of these bits of information,

32
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,160
it would be that progressives prefer universalized, high-minded concepts,

33
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,480
and they allocate their moral consideration accordingly,

34
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,440
towards large, encompassing classes of things,

35
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,560
while conservatives prefer localized, grounded concepts,

36
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,160
and they also allocate their moral consideration accordingly, towards individuals,

37
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,920
but not just random individuals, but those individuals that they're close to.

38
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,520
All that being said, it still remains to be seen which of these approaches is correct.

39
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,520
I'd guess that the answer is, it depends.

40
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,640
Is it possible that the leftist view is too ivory tower,

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,280
too disconnected from reality and the people living within it,

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,720
and the rightists are grounded and practical and more connected to others?

43
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,440
Absolutely.

44
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,920
Is it also possible that the leftist view is necessary when tackling large-scale complex

45
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,600
problems, while the rightists are too lost in the forest to see the trees?

46
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,520
Again, absolutely.

47
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,560
If you're living in a local community of trusted family members and friends,

48
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,640
and allocating your moral consideration accordingly,

49
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,720
then the localist view might be correct,

50
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,840
and the universalist would likely come in the form of some city slicker

51
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,920
who doesn't know a lick about you or your community,

52
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,400
flying in to mess things up out of ignorance,

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,240
thinking his ways work everywhere.

54
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,720
At the same time, if you're the leader of a government,

55
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,160
and you need to muddle your way through to the correct path while still representing

56
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,600
vast swaths of people who may not agree with each other let alone you,

57
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,680
while still getting the job done on a project that is simply too big to go it alone?

58
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,560
In this case, the more universalist view might be correct,

59
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,600
and the localist would likely be the small-minded country bumpkin

60
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,560
who only cares about his concerns and wants to see them fulfilled,

61
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,360
even if it's at the cost of somebody else somewhere else,

62
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,880
because their perspective doesn't allow them to see that cost,

63
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,160
or even care about it.

64
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,360
The point is, I'm not passing judgement on which position is correct here,

65
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,920
except when it comes to valuing space rocks over humans,

66
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,120
fuck you commies.

67
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,040
And yet, despite all of this,

68
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,880
how often do you see leftists try to appeal to the community in their rhetoric?

69
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,760
The black community?

70
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,120
The BIPOC community?

71
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,080
The trans community?

72
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
The LGBTQ plus community?

73
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,560
All of their rhetoric centers around the community,

74
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,440
because they want to appear to be localists against the oppressive,

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,040
tyrannical globalist corpos.

76
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,840
It's the internationalists who have no stake in anything,

77
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,600
flying in to rape and extract,

78
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,880
versus the local community of tight-knit leftists who are fighting the good fight.

79
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,160
The problem is, this view doesn't map onto reality.

80
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,880
There is no trans community, or gay community.

81
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,400
There are trans and gay individuals, but they are more different than similar.

82
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,000
They don't all live in the same area,

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,920
nor do they advocate for the same politics,

84
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,920
nor do they have the same concerns.

85
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,520
It's a superficial construction,

86
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,560
not based on the voluntary association of the people involved,

87
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,360
but rather based on one single immutable data point in their personality.

88
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,760
In other words, just because you're gay or trans,

89
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,640
doesn't mean you are like every other gay or trans person.

90
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,560
It doesn't mean that you exist in a community.

91
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,040
Compare that with the conservative definition of community,

92
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,480
which is a lot more clear cut.

93
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,320
Their family, their friends, their neighbors.

94
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,560
Deep, consensual interpersonal ties,

95
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,880
of a group of people who all live in the same area.

96
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,160
This is a community,

97
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,040
and rightists often have this while leftists don't.

98
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,640
Even in those instances where there is an identifiable physical community,

99
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,960
like a neighborhood where predominantly black people live,

100
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,720
unless there's some sense of belonging, of togetherness, of community,

101
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,080
then there's not a community there.

102
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,640
And for sure, some black neighborhoods in the states have this,

103
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,160
and a lot of others do not.

104
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,560
Asian and Latino neighborhoods are far more likely to,

105
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,280
which is why it makes a lot more sense to call them communities.

106
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,440
Progressives wield the community in order to gain a lot of leverage.

107
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,160
If you want to cancel somebody but there's no concrete allegations,

108
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,920
well, he's insulting the community,

109
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,560
even if we can't find an individual who's actually bothered.

110
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,800
If you want to force through some bit of policy,

111
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,520
whether that's legislation or terms of service or whatever,

112
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,440
well, it's good for the community,

113
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
even if you can't find any actual benefit.

114
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,640
And the thing is, they're not able to stop themselves.

115
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,480
The entirety of the left at this point sits atop a foundation of socialism.

116
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,000
Even if we're talking about some idiot rad femme who only cares about women's issues,

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,040
or some intersectional progressive who doesn't actually care about Marx,

118
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,160
if you dig deeply enough,

119
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,440
the progressive lens eventually discovers working class versus the rich

120
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,560
as a vector of oppression,

121
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,760
and their logic inevitably leads them to socialism's class war.

122
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,080
And because it's all some variant of socialism,

123
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,880
it's always going to be collectivist, not individualist.

124
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,440
The only real moral weight socialist rhetoric has is in its appeal to the collective,

125
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,800
the community, communal ownership, communal living, communal thinking.

126
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,120
So progressives can never actually appeal to gay individuals or trans individuals.

127
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,560
They can only craft non-existent communities and appeal to those.

128
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,080
We've got to coin a phrase,

129
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,440
Dev's Law or something,

130
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,600
because I've gone back to Marx's On the Jewish Question too many times in this channel.

131
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,920
If you need to understand why Marxism explicitly rejects the liberal right to free association,

132
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,080
which is the foundation of why they force people into these fake communities,

133
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,840
then you have to read this essay.

134
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,720
In it, Marx complains that the liberal conception of rights leaves man an isolated monad,

135
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,240
turned inward toward his own property, his own endeavors, and his own troubles,

136
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,560
while freedom is found through our connections to others.

137
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,400
And while Marx is correct, freedom can be found through our connections to others.

138
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,800
That's only if such a connection is voluntary.

139
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,280
The Marxist criticism of liberal rights is that they don't allow people to be connected together.

140
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,720
But we don't need a right for that.

141
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,160
If you want to do that, we'll do it.

142
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,640
The natural end result of Marx's complaint is that in the Marxist conception of rights,

143
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,040
one person will be allowed to force a connection with another due to his right to be connected.

144
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,520
Again, socialists don't understand consent.

145
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,160
As these people appeal to this mythical community,

146
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,720
they reject what actually being a part of community is.

147
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
That's why they want to abolish the family,

148
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,080
or they believe that everybody has terrible relationships with their family just because

149
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,320
they do, or why they're known for treating other human beings like such utter garbage

150
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,920
for the most trivial of reasons, or why they're so afraid that coronavirus

151
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,160
lockdowns have turned people they know wholesome.

152
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,800
Hold on, you guys keep talking about the community,

153
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,320
and now that women are becoming more community-oriented, it's suddenly a big problem?

154
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,160
Even worse, now that the power of appealing to the community has been recognized,

155
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,880
we've started to see new revisions of that idea crop up.

156
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,200
Have you happened to notice appeals to the international community or the global community

157
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,040
in the name of all sorts of causes?

158
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,760
The fundamental problem with all of this is that this just isn't what a community is.

159
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,920
It doesn't need to be mono-ethnic or monoracial or monoreligious, though that can obviously help,

160
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,080
but your community is the people around you that you voluntarily choose to associate with.

161
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,480
And as the study at the beginning of this video showed,

162
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,080
leftists do not value their communities while rightists do.

163
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,720
No matter how many mucho texto comics they write about how as queer POCs,

164
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,360
they need to rediscover a new anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist definition of family ties

165
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,800
and blah blah blah, and they're literally just talking about having friends.

166
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,000
However, while it's true that leftists don't value community, they also don't really need to.

167
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,840
They only need to appeal to it.

168
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,040
As long as they can identify themselves as the voice of the community,

169
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,160
that's the wedge in the door to introduce unwanted bureaucracy.

170
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,160
Now the trans community is not simply random trans people who are disconnected,

171
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,840
but somebody who speaks for it, and that somebody now runs an organization,

172
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,000
and that organization now lobbies politicians, collects donations, and silences critics,

173
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,960
even among those very trans people it should be representing.

174
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,880
The first thing I think is that we actually do have an ideological frame.

175
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,400
Myself and Alicia in particular are trained organizers.

176
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,560
We are trained Marxists.

177
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:59,600
We are super versed on sort of ideological theories,

178
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,800
and I think that what we really try to do is build a movement

179
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,440
that could be utilized by many, many black folk.

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,400
If you can label it, then you can centralize it.

181
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,200
And if you can centralize it, then you can gatekeep and subvert it.

182
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,520
The only way to fight back against this is to force them to keep things particular.

183
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,600
Don't let anyone get away with broad sweeping allegations or demands.

184
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
Don't consent to give your voice to their efforts.

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,600
Don't talk about things on their terms or agree to their terminology.

186
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,000
And always make sure to laugh at them so that they'll expose themselves as the tyrants they are.

187
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,560
These people don't care about any community.

188
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,960
They are anathema to the very concept of it.

189
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,360
And if they're coming for a community that you're a part of,

190
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,800
then you have an obligation to defend it.

191
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,120
Alright guys, that about does it for me.

192
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,760
You are correct in assuming that there's no Weekly Sip this week,

193
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,600
and instead you're getting this video.

194
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,960
I'm trying really hard to get back into the content creation saddle.

195
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,760
I don't like going weeks without making videos anymore,

196
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,520
so I'm just going to focus on this for a bit.

197
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,480
As always, please consider checking out the evening Twitch streams at twitch.tv slash gameboomers.

198
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,280
Hop into the Minecraft server if that tickles your fancy.

199
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
And I will see you next time.

200
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,320
I love you.
