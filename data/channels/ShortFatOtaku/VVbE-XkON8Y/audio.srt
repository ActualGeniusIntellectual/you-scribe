1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
So, President Trump hosted a social media summit.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,600
As seen by this video on the official White House YouTube channel, President Trump hosts

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,600
a social media summit.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,920
So this is a historic day, never before have so many online journalists and influencers

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,200
come together in this building to discuss the future of social media.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,840
Each of you is fulfilling a vital role in our nation.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,120
You're challenging the media gatekeepers and the corporate censors to bring the facts straight

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,960
to the American people.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,360
Together you reach more people than any television broadcast network by far.

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,920
Free speech is a bedrock of American life.

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,600
Our constitutional rights must be fiercely protected.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,320
And today I'm directing my administration to explore all regulatory and legislative

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:54,080
solutions to protect free speech and the free speech rights of all Americans.

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:02,840
You know, that music made it sound like it was some kind of epic movie moment or something.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,840
Pretty cool.

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,120
Also, did anybody else chuckle at Tim Pool's beanie poking out from the crowd?

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,680
Hope it matched his suit.

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,840
But the old media was, as just about everybody predicted, absolutely furious that YouTubers

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,280
and internet personalities were invited to discuss the issue of social media censorship.

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,160
Or really, any issue at all, instead of them.

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,600
They believe that it's their sole right to determine what people think.

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,560
Or, in the words of Carlos Maza,

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,360
This is called gatekeeping, and it's one of the most important things journalists do.

24
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,640
For example, here's CNN talking about Trump's six false claims during the summit.

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,640
Let's take a quick look at them.

26
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,400
There is no evidence that Twitter or other social media companies have made it difficult

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,760
for people to follow Trump.

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,520
We obviously can't verify what certain people might have told Trump in private about following

29
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,360
him in social media, but following him is not complicated.

30
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,840
Doing so is simply a matter of signing up for an account, searching his name, and clicking

31
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
a single button.

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,400
I'm not surprised that CNN opens up with entry-level obfuscation.

33
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,840
You can't follow somebody on Twitter if you've been banned from Twitter.

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,920
And we all know that shadow banning also happens on Twitter too.

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,140
Yeah, Jack Dorsey testified to Congress that it doesn't, but there's also evidence that

36
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,980
Twitter turned its shadow banning off for that one day so he wouldn't be lying.

37
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,440
Trump touted the low unemployment rate for women, saying it's the best in 75 years.

38
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,600
Trump exaggerated slightly.

39
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:26,000
The woman's unemployment rate for June is 3.6%, a tick above the 3.4% in April and 3.5%

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
in May.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,700
Those are excellent numbers, but it has been 66 years since the woman's rate has been

42
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,040
this low, not 75.

43
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,040
Oh no, I guess CNN's got you there, Trump.

44
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,080
On something completely trivial, Trump said they go through houses, they go up, they ring

45
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,540
doorbells, they talk to people.

46
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,680
How many toilets do they have?

47
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,120
How many desks do they have?

48
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
How many beds?

49
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
What's their roof made of?

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,040
Only thing we can't ask is, are you a citizen of the United States?

51
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,040
Trump is wrongly suggesting that the decennial census asks households about the number of

52
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,100
toilets in a house.

53
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,420
He could be referring to supplemental surveys from the Census Bureau, which do ask questions

54
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,820
about living conditions of a small sample of households.

55
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,840
If that's the case, then he's still wrong, since those surveys do ask questions of citizenship.

56
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,040
I'm sure technically he is wrong, but when I read that passage, it sounds to me he's

57
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,180
saying that the government is empowered to ask a bunch of trivial questions, but is hamstrung

58
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,620
to ask questions that are actually its business, like citizenship.

59
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,100
But more importantly, if these supplemental surveys do ask questions of citizenship, why

60
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,140
are you so opposed to asking everyone?

61
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,620
You seem to be okay with it here.

62
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,460
There were nowhere close to 21,000 people outside the rally as Trump was speaking, and

63
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:35,300
the arena had a capacity of 20,000 that night, not many more than 21,000.

64
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,100
Yeah, this is something the media likes to do, argue with Trump over his crowd size.

65
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,460
I'm sure there are times when Trump's blowing up his crowd numbers to look good,

66
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,520
and I'm sure there are times when the media lies to make him look bad.

67
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,580
My only real question is, why do you bother doing this, CNN?

68
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,060
I think everybody knows that Trump's an egotistical blowhard, but that's his brand,

69
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,780
that's not CNN's brand, so when you get into a slap fight with him over this stuff

70
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,100
you just look petty.

71
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,140
You look at Biden, they say he had 600 people, that wasn't 600, that was 150 people.

72
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,620
Independent observers reported that Joe Biden did indeed have 600 people at his first public

73
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,540
event after announcing his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination.

74
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,260
Oh god, now you're doing the same thing just the other way around, now you're playing

75
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,740
the numbers game for your guy but pumping them up, the same way Trump does to his own.

76
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:25,460
Who cares man, you're a news organization, talk about the issues, not this high school

77
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,460
popularity contest nonsense.

78
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,020
Maybe you think the best way to influence people is through peer pressure, but most

79
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,620
of us grew out of that a long time ago.

80
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,140
I know I'm not done with the article yet, but you know what I just realized?

81
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,820
CNN hasn't talked about the meat of the social media summit at all.

82
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,980
In this article, talking about the social media summit, CNN has chosen to spend their

83
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,660
one click that we might give them, nitpicking Trump over nothing.

84
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,460
I hope that was worth it CNN, because I'm never coming back.

85
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,020
How about MSNBC?

86
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:56,500
Trump's closed door social media summit is pretty spooky, I presume by closed door

87
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,860
you mean invite only and I wasn't invited.

88
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,220
President Trump's social media summit is a primer for the 2020 race.

89
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,900
Attendees, known for everything from dank memes to conspiracy theories, will be meeting

90
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,980
with the president.

91
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,180
Dank memes are the new social scare guys.

92
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,440
It was rock and roll for a while, then comics, then D&D, video games, and now it's memes.

93
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:39,680
Think of the children.

94
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,520
Of course they deny any censorship, they're the ones being accused of it.

95
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,680
And when the president accuses you of censorship, if you've got no plans to actually change,

96
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,280
your best hope really is to double down.

97
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,480
But more to the point, I thought you guys on the radical left were all about believing

98
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
the victims.

99
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:59,160
You seem to have thrown your hat in with the accused pretty quickly this time.

100
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,760
They weren't invited because they are the problem.

101
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,880
It's not a summit with social media, it's a summit about social media, hearing from

102
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,320
the independent voices that use it, who are affected by its policies.

103
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,200
Again, the social media companies are the accused, not the victim.

104
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,560
And I know you know this, because the mainstream media reported on it, but big names in social

105
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,680
media have already been to the White House to give their take on things back in April.

106
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,020
They've had their say, and the only reason you're crying foul is because we're finally

107
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,480
getting to have ours too.

108
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,320
We also know that on the list of provocateurs who are on that list, Ali Alexander-

109
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,200
Wait, wait, wait, provocateurs?

110
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,960
Tim Pool is a provocateur?

111
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,920
Also, you do realize the guy's face is in every single one of his videos, right?

112
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,560
There's no reason to have some anonymous shadow image.

113
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,760
Here, you know what?

114
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,960
Here, I fixed your video for you, I just did your job.

115
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,840
I'm better at this than MSNBC.

116
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,800
Listen, this is legitimizing people who otherwise wouldn't have had such a big platform to

117
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,200
talk about trolling, harassment, disinformation, etc.

118
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,840
Yeah, that's the point.

119
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,300
It's legitimizing people who don't have a big platform, specifically because the only

120
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,600
reason they do not is due to Silicon Valley putting their thumb on the scales.

121
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,580
Algorithms get tweaked, posts get censored, accounts get banned, all in such a way to

122
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,200
limit the discoverability of independent voices and promote mainstream ones.

123
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,240
White House exposure is just one way to level the playing field.

124
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,260
Trump has largely invited people who have earned their legitimization, but have had

125
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,120
it unfairly taken away from them by the social media cartel.

126
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,080
You know, if you talk to disinformation researchers about this, they all make these network graphs

127
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,520
that show sort of the range and scope of disinformation and how it travels.

128
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,640
And a lot of these people are at the center of these network graphs.

129
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,860
Oh, you mean that alternate influence piece of garbage?

130
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,620
You know, that report that showed all of these politically very different YouTubers

131
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,540
all linked together as part of some alt-right network, solely because they debated each

132
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,460
other or appeared together or whatever?

133
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:53,660
Yeah, see, when I look at this, I see a group of people who have almost nothing in common,

134
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,460
except that they're not radical leftists.

135
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,460
That's it.

136
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,500
There's basic conservatives, trad thoughts, centrists, classical liberals, center lefties,

137
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:07,260
white nationalists, trolls, basically all possible groups except card-carrying progressives.

138
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,180
Actually, no, because destiny is on there.

139
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:23,460
Your research is trash.

140
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,100
That's because Tim Pool is a center lefty who's not willing to cede the left to the

141
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,120
radicals, and I kind of view myself the same way.

142
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,640
I'm still center left, and I still spend most of my time criticizing the radical left,

143
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,120
because at this point, the radical left has gone so far off the deep end that they're

144
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,200
more of a threat than the radical right, even from a center left point of view.

145
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,800
The neo-Nazis might be dangerous, but at least there's only a couple thousand of them.

146
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,920
Antifa is absolutely everywhere, attacking civilians and journalists with impunity.

147
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,460
I want to say it's almost entirely people who push innuendo on the internet.

148
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,880
This is not about censorship.

149
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,560
This is about protecting a strategy for 2020.

150
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,880
You know, Brad Parscale, who ran Trump's digital campaign in 2016, now runs the 2020

151
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
campaign.

152
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,360
They understand how important it is to get innuendo out about candidates, and innuendo

153
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,160
about enemies of Donald Trump out into the public sphere.

154
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,040
When he says innuendo, he's referring to two things.

155
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
One, memes.

156
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Think of the children.

157
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,760
Two, more importantly, an unfiltered truth, untouched by the bias and the rhetoric and

158
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,000
the agenda of the mainstream media, a truth without gatekeeping.

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,880
An internet full of independent creators of all political persuasions allows the public

160
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,840
to see the full story and make up their own minds on context and interpretation.

161
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,360
Yes, it puts responsibility on the viewer to not be a sheep, but that's how we want

162
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
it to be.

163
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,080
But let's move on to the unholy trinity of villainy.

164
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,620
Vice, Vox, and The Verge.

165
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:50,680
Trump invites fringe social media company popular with Nazis to the White House.

166
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,960
Minds features far-right figures the same way that Facebook and Twitter do.

167
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,680
Far-right individuals use the platform.

168
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,940
What's next, Vice?

169
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,160
A headline like, far-right figures may be communicating via commonly used cell phone

170
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
carriers?

171
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,560
In fact, in this article, Vice says Minds was once home to several neo-Nazi extremist

172
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
groups.

173
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,320
Yeah, again, so was Twitter and Facebook.

174
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,560
It doesn't even matter that Minds banned those groups, because it's been put on their

175
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,560
permanent record.

176
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,400
You know, when I finished high school, I figured we'd have put this kind of nonsense behind

177
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
us.

178
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,840
The man-children activists over at Vice are still keeping score.

179
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,160
The summit will be attended by an assortment of individuals connected to nationalist movements,

180
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,560
QAnon, and anti-Semitic conspiracies surrounding George Soros.

181
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,440
I don't know much about QAnon, they seem on the surface like a more right-leaning,

182
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,040
less reliable version of Veritas, so whatever.

183
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,680
But Trump's a nationalist, so there's no surprise that he invited nationalists to

184
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,680
his shindig.

185
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,300
And as for Soros, it's not really a conspiracy theory when you publicly admit what you're

186
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,040
doing in your own words, is it?

187
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:57,080
Tim Pool, a right-wing media figure who once worked at Vice News, tweeted an invitation

188
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
to the summit.

189
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,560
Oh, oh, Vice, are you admitting to being a right-wing publication?

190
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,560
Because that's what I'm reading here when I put on my social justice glasses.

191
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,940
Here, just let me write another headline, okay?

192
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:12,720
Right-wing publication Vice exposed as once having employed YouTube beanie enthusiast

193
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
Tim Pool.

194
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
There.

195
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,400
That's about the quality of your reporting, isn't it?

196
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,880
Honestly, the whole thing just sounds like whining about independent voices finally breaking

197
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,820
free from the mainstream jackboot that's been pressed against their necks ever since

198
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,820
Trump took office.

199
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,600
Vice, the reason that you weren't invited is because you're the one wearing the boots.

200
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,220
Another article from Vice called the summit bonkers.

201
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,960
It brought up that Project Veritas's James O'Keefe attended, labeling him, again, a

202
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,960
provocateur, as well as the fact that Twitter went down for the day just as hashtag social

203
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,660
media summit began blowing up, calling it yet another conspiracy theory.

204
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,440
But there's not much here that's really different.

205
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,320
It's just a bunch of journalists whining and activists running interference for big

206
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
tech.

207
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
Here's Vox's take.

208
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,200
Trump's social media summit was a circus.

209
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,600
Its aftermath was even worse.

210
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,200
Oh yeah, that picture there, I saw the video to that.

211
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,600
Gorka strode up to reporter Brian Karam and called him a punk?

212
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,200
Wait, that's not what the video showed.

213
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Don't be sad.

214
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Don't be sad.

215
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
No, I'm just standing around.

216
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
This is a group of people that are eager for demonic possession.

217
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
demonic possession.

218
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
And you're a journalist, right?

219
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
That's right.

220
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

221
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Hey, come over here and talk to me, brother.

222
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
We can go outside and have a long conversation.

223
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
You're threatening me now in the white house.

224
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
You're threatening me in the rose garden.

225
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
You are a punk.

226
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
You're not a journalist.

227
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
You're a punk.

228
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
Go home.

229
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Go home.

230
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
Hey, Gorka, get a job.

231
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:40,920
Hey, just for the record, he'd kick your punk ass.

232
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,520
Yeah, the video showed Brian threatening to start a fight, daring Gorka to step forward.

233
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,600
And when he did, all Brian could do is fold his hands in front of him like a chump.

234
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,740
And Vox, you really think it's Gorka's fault?

235
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,320
The journalist cries out in pain as he strikes you.

236
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,280
The goal of the White House Social Media Summit wasn't actually to highlight bias that social

237
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,200
media companies have against conservatives or other groups, because there's no evidence

238
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,680
such bias exists.

239
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,840
Are you kidding me?

240
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
Really?

241
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,120
Are you guys this ridiculous?

242
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,520
Let's do a few quick searches on incognito.

243
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,240
Here's one everyone knows about.

244
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,940
Feminist own compilation.

245
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,940
Top result.

246
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,920
Why office air conditioning is sexist.

247
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
Really?

248
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,220
This is not at all what I was looking for.

249
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,240
Ben Shapiro's feud with Rosie O'Donnell.

250
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,280
Top 10 feminist moments of 2018.

251
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,560
Women debate fat acceptance.

252
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,960
It eventually recommends a channel full of what I actually searched for.

253
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,360
Compilations of feminists getting owned.

254
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,020
With views in the millions on many of its videos.

255
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,120
But none of those videos appear in the actual search.

256
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,280
How about the topic of today?

257
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,520
The Social Media Summit.

258
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
Fox.

259
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
VOA News.

260
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
MSNBC.

261
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
PBS.

262
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,520
ABC.

263
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,520
Washington Post.

264
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
Etc.

265
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Etc.

266
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,520
Not a single YouTuber discussing the event.

267
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,040
Despite the videos made by YouTubers having way more hits.

268
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,840
And the event being about YouTubers.

269
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,480
What's on YouTube's trending tab?

270
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,200
Okay, mostly Normie vomit.

271
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Wait, wait, wait.

272
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,280
Creator on the rise?

273
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,200
I get more hits than these chumps.

274
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,840
Where's my on the rise status?

275
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,160
How about on the news trending?

276
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,200
Oh, surprise, surprise.

277
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,360
It's all of the alphabet networks again.

278
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,360
Check this out.

279
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,360
111 views in 52 minutes by Bloomberg.

280
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,200
I'm not usually one to brag, but even I get more views in that span of time.

281
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:16,000
When Vox says no bias exists, either they're painfully bad at their job, or their camp

282
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,200
benefits from the bias that exists.

283
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,920
And finally on the verge, the White House Social Media Summit was full of hypocrisy

284
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
and comedy.

285
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,720
I half expected the byline to say, and that's a bad thing.

286
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,160
The stuff that conservative voices think of does not always reach the maximum possible

287
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
audience.

288
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,860
Sometimes conservatives do not appear as high as they would like to in search results.

289
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,080
Sometimes they get suspended or even banned.

290
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,540
This has led to much conspiratorial thinking that liberal leaning Silicon Valley is throttling

291
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,680
their access in an effort to tip the scales of democracy.

292
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,080
It's not a conspiracy theory.

293
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,080
We've all seen the Project Veritas video.

294
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,320
Silicon Valley has tried to scrub the internet of it, but we've all seen it.

295
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,460
It's still up on Bitchute.

296
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,720
We all know the truth.

297
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,840
This is their actual plan.

298
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,600
Conservatives typically take great pains to protect the free market from undue interference

299
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,520
from the government, but social networks are powerful enough that, in this case, Republicans

300
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,840
intend to intervene.

301
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,440
And they absolutely need to.

302
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,620
Social media and journalists, and many others since 2016 hell, since 2014, have began to

303
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,520
publicly misbehave so bad that it beggars belief.

304
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,040
Before Gamergate and Brexit and Trump, these people still did all of this nonsense, but

305
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,640
they did it silently and quietly and in private.

306
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,220
But as soon as the public became aware of it, it's almost like these people said screw

307
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,220
it.

308
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,220
They already know the truth.

309
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,260
Let's open the open and ramp it up to 11 because the jig is up and they can't stop

310
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,260
us anyway.

311
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,060
Elsewhere, Senator Josh Hawley has proposed legislation that would require large social

312
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,020
networks to treat every political opinion equally, which would be great news for Nazis.

313
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,940
But even in such a world, feed-based platforms will still have to rank and recommend content.

314
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,820
Many Conservative complaints revolve around the fact that they do not always rank at the

315
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,820
top.

316
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,720
No, the complaint is that their rankings are not actually listed in order of their rank,

317
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
which is what you'd expect.

318
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,020
The Trending tab on YouTube might as well be called YouTube-approved content because

319
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,500
it's got nothing to do with what's actually trending.

320
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,300
Feed-based platforms do not have to recommend content at all, and the only thing they have

321
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,280
to do to rank content properly is simply present it in order of popularity.

322
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,940
Most of the other articles floating around all sound like these handful that I've shown

323
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,940
you.

324
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,940
Lots of upper-class socialists running interference for big companies as they bizarrely like to

325
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,940
do.

326
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,300
Lots of journalists whining that they're no longer the great censor and that Trump

327
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,680
is willing to simply sidestep them not just on Twitter anymore but in real life too.

328
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,600
There's a sense of denial in labeling legitimate complaints as conspiracy theories, despite

329
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,560
the mounting evidence to the contrary.

330
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,480
The Veritas video, James Damore, YouTube's Trending tab being a joke, Facebook banning

331
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,080
Paul Joseph Watson for no reason, Twitter's misgendering speech on Joe Rogan, Alex Jones'

332
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,600
complete expulsion from the entire internet, Sargon's demonetization and removal from
