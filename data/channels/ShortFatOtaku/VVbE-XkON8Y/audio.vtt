00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
So, President Trump hosted a social media summit.

00:03.520 --> 00:07.600
As seen by this video on the official White House YouTube channel, President Trump hosts

00:07.600 --> 00:08.600
a social media summit.

00:08.600 --> 00:13.920
So this is a historic day, never before have so many online journalists and influencers

00:13.920 --> 00:19.200
come together in this building to discuss the future of social media.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.840
Each of you is fulfilling a vital role in our nation.

00:22.840 --> 00:28.120
You're challenging the media gatekeepers and the corporate censors to bring the facts straight

00:28.120 --> 00:29.960
to the American people.

00:29.960 --> 00:35.360
Together you reach more people than any television broadcast network by far.

00:35.360 --> 00:38.920
Free speech is a bedrock of American life.

00:38.920 --> 00:42.600
Our constitutional rights must be fiercely protected.

00:42.600 --> 00:47.320
And today I'm directing my administration to explore all regulatory and legislative

00:47.320 --> 00:54.080
solutions to protect free speech and the free speech rights of all Americans.

00:55.080 --> 01:02.840
You know, that music made it sound like it was some kind of epic movie moment or something.

01:02.840 --> 01:03.840
Pretty cool.

01:03.840 --> 01:07.120
Also, did anybody else chuckle at Tim Pool's beanie poking out from the crowd?

01:07.120 --> 01:08.680
Hope it matched his suit.

01:08.680 --> 01:13.840
But the old media was, as just about everybody predicted, absolutely furious that YouTubers

01:13.840 --> 01:18.280
and internet personalities were invited to discuss the issue of social media censorship.

01:18.280 --> 01:21.160
Or really, any issue at all, instead of them.

01:21.240 --> 01:24.600
They believe that it's their sole right to determine what people think.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.560
Or, in the words of Carlos Maza,

01:26.560 --> 01:30.360
This is called gatekeeping, and it's one of the most important things journalists do.

01:30.360 --> 01:35.640
For example, here's CNN talking about Trump's six false claims during the summit.

01:35.640 --> 01:37.640
Let's take a quick look at them.

01:37.640 --> 01:41.400
There is no evidence that Twitter or other social media companies have made it difficult

01:41.400 --> 01:42.760
for people to follow Trump.

01:42.760 --> 01:46.520
We obviously can't verify what certain people might have told Trump in private about following

01:46.520 --> 01:49.360
him in social media, but following him is not complicated.

01:49.560 --> 01:53.840
Doing so is simply a matter of signing up for an account, searching his name, and clicking

01:53.840 --> 01:54.840
a single button.

01:54.840 --> 01:58.400
I'm not surprised that CNN opens up with entry-level obfuscation.

01:58.400 --> 02:01.840
You can't follow somebody on Twitter if you've been banned from Twitter.

02:01.840 --> 02:04.920
And we all know that shadow banning also happens on Twitter too.

02:04.920 --> 02:09.140
Yeah, Jack Dorsey testified to Congress that it doesn't, but there's also evidence that

02:09.140 --> 02:13.980
Twitter turned its shadow banning off for that one day so he wouldn't be lying.

02:13.980 --> 02:18.440
Trump touted the low unemployment rate for women, saying it's the best in 75 years.

02:18.440 --> 02:19.600
Trump exaggerated slightly.

02:19.600 --> 02:26.000
The woman's unemployment rate for June is 3.6%, a tick above the 3.4% in April and 3.5%

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
in May.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.700
Those are excellent numbers, but it has been 66 years since the woman's rate has been

02:30.700 --> 02:32.040
this low, not 75.

02:32.040 --> 02:35.040
Oh no, I guess CNN's got you there, Trump.

02:35.040 --> 02:39.080
On something completely trivial, Trump said they go through houses, they go up, they ring

02:39.080 --> 02:40.540
doorbells, they talk to people.

02:40.540 --> 02:41.680
How many toilets do they have?

02:41.680 --> 02:43.120
How many desks do they have?

02:43.120 --> 02:44.120
How many beds?

02:44.120 --> 02:45.120
What's their roof made of?

02:45.120 --> 02:49.040
Only thing we can't ask is, are you a citizen of the United States?

02:49.040 --> 02:53.040
Trump is wrongly suggesting that the decennial census asks households about the number of

02:53.040 --> 02:54.100
toilets in a house.

02:54.100 --> 02:58.420
He could be referring to supplemental surveys from the Census Bureau, which do ask questions

02:58.420 --> 03:00.820
about living conditions of a small sample of households.

03:00.820 --> 03:05.840
If that's the case, then he's still wrong, since those surveys do ask questions of citizenship.

03:05.840 --> 03:10.040
I'm sure technically he is wrong, but when I read that passage, it sounds to me he's

03:10.040 --> 03:14.180
saying that the government is empowered to ask a bunch of trivial questions, but is hamstrung

03:14.180 --> 03:17.620
to ask questions that are actually its business, like citizenship.

03:17.620 --> 03:22.100
But more importantly, if these supplemental surveys do ask questions of citizenship, why

03:22.100 --> 03:24.140
are you so opposed to asking everyone?

03:24.140 --> 03:25.620
You seem to be okay with it here.

03:25.620 --> 03:30.460
There were nowhere close to 21,000 people outside the rally as Trump was speaking, and

03:30.460 --> 03:35.300
the arena had a capacity of 20,000 that night, not many more than 21,000.

03:35.300 --> 03:40.100
Yeah, this is something the media likes to do, argue with Trump over his crowd size.

03:40.100 --> 03:43.460
I'm sure there are times when Trump's blowing up his crowd numbers to look good,

03:43.740 --> 03:46.520
and I'm sure there are times when the media lies to make him look bad.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.580
My only real question is, why do you bother doing this, CNN?

03:49.580 --> 03:54.060
I think everybody knows that Trump's an egotistical blowhard, but that's his brand,

03:54.060 --> 03:57.780
that's not CNN's brand, so when you get into a slap fight with him over this stuff

03:57.780 --> 03:59.100
you just look petty.

03:59.100 --> 04:04.140
You look at Biden, they say he had 600 people, that wasn't 600, that was 150 people.

04:04.140 --> 04:08.620
Independent observers reported that Joe Biden did indeed have 600 people at his first public

04:08.620 --> 04:12.540
event after announcing his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination.

04:12.620 --> 04:16.260
Oh god, now you're doing the same thing just the other way around, now you're playing

04:16.260 --> 04:20.740
the numbers game for your guy but pumping them up, the same way Trump does to his own.

04:20.740 --> 04:25.460
Who cares man, you're a news organization, talk about the issues, not this high school

04:25.460 --> 04:27.460
popularity contest nonsense.

04:27.460 --> 04:31.020
Maybe you think the best way to influence people is through peer pressure, but most

04:31.020 --> 04:32.620
of us grew out of that a long time ago.

04:32.620 --> 04:35.140
I know I'm not done with the article yet, but you know what I just realized?

04:35.140 --> 04:38.820
CNN hasn't talked about the meat of the social media summit at all.

04:38.820 --> 04:42.980
In this article, talking about the social media summit, CNN has chosen to spend their

04:42.980 --> 04:46.660
one click that we might give them, nitpicking Trump over nothing.

04:46.660 --> 04:49.460
I hope that was worth it CNN, because I'm never coming back.

04:49.460 --> 04:51.020
How about MSNBC?

04:51.020 --> 04:56.500
Trump's closed door social media summit is pretty spooky, I presume by closed door

04:56.500 --> 04:59.860
you mean invite only and I wasn't invited.

04:59.860 --> 05:03.220
President Trump's social media summit is a primer for the 2020 race.

05:03.220 --> 05:07.900
Attendees, known for everything from dank memes to conspiracy theories, will be meeting

05:07.900 --> 05:08.980
with the president.

05:08.980 --> 05:11.180
Dank memes are the new social scare guys.

05:11.180 --> 05:16.440
It was rock and roll for a while, then comics, then D&D, video games, and now it's memes.

05:16.440 --> 05:39.680
Think of the children.

05:39.680 --> 05:43.520
Of course they deny any censorship, they're the ones being accused of it.

05:43.520 --> 05:47.680
And when the president accuses you of censorship, if you've got no plans to actually change,

05:47.680 --> 05:49.280
your best hope really is to double down.

05:49.280 --> 05:52.480
But more to the point, I thought you guys on the radical left were all about believing

05:52.480 --> 05:53.480
the victims.

05:53.480 --> 05:59.160
You seem to have thrown your hat in with the accused pretty quickly this time.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.760
They weren't invited because they are the problem.

06:01.760 --> 06:05.880
It's not a summit with social media, it's a summit about social media, hearing from

06:05.880 --> 06:09.320
the independent voices that use it, who are affected by its policies.

06:09.320 --> 06:13.200
Again, the social media companies are the accused, not the victim.

06:13.200 --> 06:17.560
And I know you know this, because the mainstream media reported on it, but big names in social

06:17.560 --> 06:21.680
media have already been to the White House to give their take on things back in April.

06:21.680 --> 06:26.020
They've had their say, and the only reason you're crying foul is because we're finally

06:26.020 --> 06:27.480
getting to have ours too.

06:27.480 --> 06:31.320
We also know that on the list of provocateurs who are on that list, Ali Alexander-

06:31.320 --> 06:33.200
Wait, wait, wait, provocateurs?

06:33.200 --> 06:34.960
Tim Pool is a provocateur?

06:34.960 --> 06:38.920
Also, you do realize the guy's face is in every single one of his videos, right?

06:38.920 --> 06:41.560
There's no reason to have some anonymous shadow image.

06:41.560 --> 06:42.760
Here, you know what?

06:42.760 --> 06:45.960
Here, I fixed your video for you, I just did your job.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.840
I'm better at this than MSNBC.

06:47.840 --> 06:52.800
Listen, this is legitimizing people who otherwise wouldn't have had such a big platform to

06:52.800 --> 06:55.200
talk about trolling, harassment, disinformation, etc.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.840
Yeah, that's the point.

06:56.840 --> 07:00.300
It's legitimizing people who don't have a big platform, specifically because the only

07:00.300 --> 07:04.600
reason they do not is due to Silicon Valley putting their thumb on the scales.

07:04.600 --> 07:08.580
Algorithms get tweaked, posts get censored, accounts get banned, all in such a way to

07:08.580 --> 07:12.200
limit the discoverability of independent voices and promote mainstream ones.

07:12.240 --> 07:15.240
White House exposure is just one way to level the playing field.

07:15.240 --> 07:19.260
Trump has largely invited people who have earned their legitimization, but have had

07:19.260 --> 07:22.120
it unfairly taken away from them by the social media cartel.

07:22.120 --> 07:28.080
You know, if you talk to disinformation researchers about this, they all make these network graphs

07:28.080 --> 07:33.520
that show sort of the range and scope of disinformation and how it travels.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.640
And a lot of these people are at the center of these network graphs.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.860
Oh, you mean that alternate influence piece of garbage?

07:38.860 --> 07:42.620
You know, that report that showed all of these politically very different YouTubers

07:42.620 --> 07:46.540
all linked together as part of some alt-right network, solely because they debated each

07:46.540 --> 07:48.460
other or appeared together or whatever?

07:48.460 --> 07:53.660
Yeah, see, when I look at this, I see a group of people who have almost nothing in common,

07:53.660 --> 07:55.460
except that they're not radical leftists.

07:55.460 --> 07:56.460
That's it.

07:56.460 --> 08:01.500
There's basic conservatives, trad thoughts, centrists, classical liberals, center lefties,

08:01.500 --> 08:07.260
white nationalists, trolls, basically all possible groups except card-carrying progressives.

08:07.260 --> 08:09.180
Actually, no, because destiny is on there.

08:09.180 --> 08:23.460
Your research is trash.

08:23.460 --> 08:27.100
That's because Tim Pool is a center lefty who's not willing to cede the left to the

08:27.100 --> 08:29.120
radicals, and I kind of view myself the same way.

08:29.120 --> 08:33.640
I'm still center left, and I still spend most of my time criticizing the radical left,

08:33.640 --> 08:38.120
because at this point, the radical left has gone so far off the deep end that they're

08:38.120 --> 08:41.200
more of a threat than the radical right, even from a center left point of view.

08:41.200 --> 08:44.800
The neo-Nazis might be dangerous, but at least there's only a couple thousand of them.

08:44.800 --> 08:48.920
Antifa is absolutely everywhere, attacking civilians and journalists with impunity.

08:48.920 --> 08:53.460
I want to say it's almost entirely people who push innuendo on the internet.

08:53.460 --> 08:54.880
This is not about censorship.

08:54.880 --> 08:58.560
This is about protecting a strategy for 2020.

08:58.560 --> 09:03.880
You know, Brad Parscale, who ran Trump's digital campaign in 2016, now runs the 2020

09:03.880 --> 09:04.880
campaign.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.360
They understand how important it is to get innuendo out about candidates, and innuendo

09:08.360 --> 09:12.160
about enemies of Donald Trump out into the public sphere.

09:12.160 --> 09:15.040
When he says innuendo, he's referring to two things.

09:15.040 --> 09:16.040
One, memes.

09:16.040 --> 09:17.040
Think of the children.

09:17.040 --> 09:22.760
Two, more importantly, an unfiltered truth, untouched by the bias and the rhetoric and

09:22.760 --> 09:26.000
the agenda of the mainstream media, a truth without gatekeeping.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.880
An internet full of independent creators of all political persuasions allows the public

09:29.880 --> 09:33.840
to see the full story and make up their own minds on context and interpretation.

09:33.840 --> 09:38.360
Yes, it puts responsibility on the viewer to not be a sheep, but that's how we want

09:38.360 --> 09:39.360
it to be.

09:39.360 --> 09:42.080
But let's move on to the unholy trinity of villainy.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.620
Vice, Vox, and The Verge.

09:44.620 --> 09:50.680
Trump invites fringe social media company popular with Nazis to the White House.

09:50.680 --> 09:54.960
Minds features far-right figures the same way that Facebook and Twitter do.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.680
Far-right individuals use the platform.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.940
What's next, Vice?

09:57.940 --> 10:03.160
A headline like, far-right figures may be communicating via commonly used cell phone

10:03.160 --> 10:04.160
carriers?

10:04.160 --> 10:09.560
In fact, in this article, Vice says Minds was once home to several neo-Nazi extremist

10:09.560 --> 10:10.560
groups.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.320
Yeah, again, so was Twitter and Facebook.

10:12.320 --> 10:16.560
It doesn't even matter that Minds banned those groups, because it's been put on their

10:16.560 --> 10:17.560
permanent record.

10:17.560 --> 10:21.400
You know, when I finished high school, I figured we'd have put this kind of nonsense behind

10:21.400 --> 10:22.400
us.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.840
The man-children activists over at Vice are still keeping score.

10:25.840 --> 10:30.160
The summit will be attended by an assortment of individuals connected to nationalist movements,

10:30.160 --> 10:34.560
QAnon, and anti-Semitic conspiracies surrounding George Soros.

10:34.560 --> 10:38.440
I don't know much about QAnon, they seem on the surface like a more right-leaning,

10:38.440 --> 10:41.040
less reliable version of Veritas, so whatever.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.680
But Trump's a nationalist, so there's no surprise that he invited nationalists to

10:44.680 --> 10:45.680
his shindig.

10:45.680 --> 10:49.300
And as for Soros, it's not really a conspiracy theory when you publicly admit what you're

10:49.300 --> 10:51.040
doing in your own words, is it?

10:51.040 --> 10:57.080
Tim Pool, a right-wing media figure who once worked at Vice News, tweeted an invitation

10:57.080 --> 10:58.080
to the summit.

10:58.080 --> 11:01.560
Oh, oh, Vice, are you admitting to being a right-wing publication?

11:01.560 --> 11:04.560
Because that's what I'm reading here when I put on my social justice glasses.

11:04.560 --> 11:06.940
Here, just let me write another headline, okay?

11:06.940 --> 11:12.720
Right-wing publication Vice exposed as once having employed YouTube beanie enthusiast

11:12.720 --> 11:13.720
Tim Pool.

11:13.720 --> 11:14.720
There.

11:14.720 --> 11:16.400
That's about the quality of your reporting, isn't it?

11:16.400 --> 11:20.880
Honestly, the whole thing just sounds like whining about independent voices finally breaking

11:20.880 --> 11:24.820
free from the mainstream jackboot that's been pressed against their necks ever since

11:24.820 --> 11:25.820
Trump took office.

11:25.820 --> 11:29.600
Vice, the reason that you weren't invited is because you're the one wearing the boots.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.220
Another article from Vice called the summit bonkers.

11:32.220 --> 11:36.960
It brought up that Project Veritas's James O'Keefe attended, labeling him, again, a

11:36.960 --> 11:41.960
provocateur, as well as the fact that Twitter went down for the day just as hashtag social

11:41.960 --> 11:45.660
media summit began blowing up, calling it yet another conspiracy theory.

11:45.660 --> 11:47.440
But there's not much here that's really different.

11:47.440 --> 11:51.320
It's just a bunch of journalists whining and activists running interference for big

11:51.320 --> 11:52.320
tech.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.320
Here's Vox's take.

11:53.320 --> 11:55.200
Trump's social media summit was a circus.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.600
Its aftermath was even worse.

11:56.600 --> 11:59.200
Oh yeah, that picture there, I saw the video to that.

11:59.200 --> 12:02.600
Gorka strode up to reporter Brian Karam and called him a punk?

12:02.600 --> 12:04.200
Wait, that's not what the video showed.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.200
Don't be sad.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.200
Don't be sad.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.200
No, I'm just standing around.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.200
This is a group of people that are eager for demonic possession.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.200
demonic possession.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.200
And you're a journalist, right?

12:10.200 --> 12:11.200
That's right.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.200
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

12:12.200 --> 12:13.200
Hey, come over here and talk to me, brother.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.200
We can go outside and have a long conversation.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.200
You're threatening me now in the white house.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.200
You're threatening me in the rose garden.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.200
You are a punk.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.200
You're not a journalist.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.200
You're a punk.

12:19.200 --> 12:20.200
Go home.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.200
Go home.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.200
Hey, Gorka, get a job.

12:22.200 --> 12:40.920
Hey, just for the record, he'd kick your punk ass.

12:40.920 --> 12:45.520
Yeah, the video showed Brian threatening to start a fight, daring Gorka to step forward.

12:45.520 --> 12:49.600
And when he did, all Brian could do is fold his hands in front of him like a chump.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.740
And Vox, you really think it's Gorka's fault?

12:51.740 --> 12:54.320
The journalist cries out in pain as he strikes you.

12:54.320 --> 12:58.280
The goal of the White House Social Media Summit wasn't actually to highlight bias that social

12:58.280 --> 13:02.200
media companies have against conservatives or other groups, because there's no evidence

13:02.200 --> 13:03.680
such bias exists.

13:03.680 --> 13:04.840
Are you kidding me?

13:04.840 --> 13:05.840
Really?

13:05.840 --> 13:07.120
Are you guys this ridiculous?

13:07.120 --> 13:09.520
Let's do a few quick searches on incognito.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.240
Here's one everyone knows about.

13:11.240 --> 13:12.940
Feminist own compilation.

13:12.940 --> 13:13.940
Top result.

13:13.940 --> 13:15.920
Why office air conditioning is sexist.

13:15.920 --> 13:16.920
Really?

13:16.920 --> 13:18.220
This is not at all what I was looking for.

13:18.220 --> 13:20.240
Ben Shapiro's feud with Rosie O'Donnell.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.280
Top 10 feminist moments of 2018.

13:22.280 --> 13:23.560
Women debate fat acceptance.

13:23.560 --> 13:26.960
It eventually recommends a channel full of what I actually searched for.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.360
Compilations of feminists getting owned.

13:28.360 --> 13:31.020
With views in the millions on many of its videos.

13:31.020 --> 13:33.120
But none of those videos appear in the actual search.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.280
How about the topic of today?

13:34.280 --> 13:35.520
The Social Media Summit.

13:35.520 --> 13:36.520
Fox.

13:36.520 --> 13:37.520
VOA News.

13:37.520 --> 13:38.520
MSNBC.

13:38.520 --> 13:39.520
PBS.

13:39.520 --> 13:40.520
ABC.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.520
Washington Post.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.520
Etc.

13:42.520 --> 13:43.520
Etc.

13:43.520 --> 13:44.520
Not a single YouTuber discussing the event.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.040
Despite the videos made by YouTubers having way more hits.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.840
And the event being about YouTubers.

13:48.840 --> 13:50.480
What's on YouTube's trending tab?

13:50.480 --> 13:52.200
Okay, mostly Normie vomit.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.200
Wait, wait, wait.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.280
Creator on the rise?

13:54.280 --> 13:56.200
I get more hits than these chumps.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.840
Where's my on the rise status?

13:57.840 --> 13:59.160
How about on the news trending?

13:59.160 --> 14:00.200
Oh, surprise, surprise.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.360
It's all of the alphabet networks again.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.360
Check this out.

14:03.360 --> 14:06.360
111 views in 52 minutes by Bloomberg.

14:06.360 --> 14:10.200
I'm not usually one to brag, but even I get more views in that span of time.

14:10.200 --> 14:16.000
When Vox says no bias exists, either they're painfully bad at their job, or their camp

14:16.000 --> 14:18.200
benefits from the bias that exists.

14:18.200 --> 14:21.920
And finally on the verge, the White House Social Media Summit was full of hypocrisy

14:21.920 --> 14:22.920
and comedy.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.720
I half expected the byline to say, and that's a bad thing.

14:25.720 --> 14:29.160
The stuff that conservative voices think of does not always reach the maximum possible

14:29.160 --> 14:30.160
audience.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.860
Sometimes conservatives do not appear as high as they would like to in search results.

14:33.860 --> 14:36.080
Sometimes they get suspended or even banned.

14:36.080 --> 14:40.540
This has led to much conspiratorial thinking that liberal leaning Silicon Valley is throttling

14:40.540 --> 14:43.680
their access in an effort to tip the scales of democracy.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.080
It's not a conspiracy theory.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.080
We've all seen the Project Veritas video.

14:47.080 --> 14:50.320
Silicon Valley has tried to scrub the internet of it, but we've all seen it.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.460
It's still up on Bitchute.

14:51.460 --> 14:52.720
We all know the truth.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.840
This is their actual plan.

14:54.840 --> 14:58.600
Conservatives typically take great pains to protect the free market from undue interference

14:58.600 --> 15:02.520
from the government, but social networks are powerful enough that, in this case, Republicans

15:02.520 --> 15:03.840
intend to intervene.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.440
And they absolutely need to.

15:05.440 --> 15:10.620
Social media and journalists, and many others since 2016 hell, since 2014, have began to

15:10.620 --> 15:14.520
publicly misbehave so bad that it beggars belief.

15:14.520 --> 15:19.040
Before Gamergate and Brexit and Trump, these people still did all of this nonsense, but

15:19.040 --> 15:21.640
they did it silently and quietly and in private.

15:21.640 --> 15:25.220
But as soon as the public became aware of it, it's almost like these people said screw

15:25.220 --> 15:26.220
it.

15:26.220 --> 15:27.220
They already know the truth.

15:27.220 --> 15:30.260
Let's open the open and ramp it up to 11 because the jig is up and they can't stop

15:30.260 --> 15:31.260
us anyway.

15:31.260 --> 15:35.060
Elsewhere, Senator Josh Hawley has proposed legislation that would require large social

15:35.060 --> 15:39.020
networks to treat every political opinion equally, which would be great news for Nazis.

15:39.020 --> 15:43.940
But even in such a world, feed-based platforms will still have to rank and recommend content.

15:43.940 --> 15:46.820
Many Conservative complaints revolve around the fact that they do not always rank at the

15:46.820 --> 15:47.820
top.

15:47.820 --> 15:51.720
No, the complaint is that their rankings are not actually listed in order of their rank,

15:51.720 --> 15:52.720
which is what you'd expect.

15:52.720 --> 15:56.020
The Trending tab on YouTube might as well be called YouTube-approved content because

15:56.020 --> 15:58.500
it's got nothing to do with what's actually trending.

15:58.500 --> 16:02.300
Feed-based platforms do not have to recommend content at all, and the only thing they have

16:02.300 --> 16:07.280
to do to rank content properly is simply present it in order of popularity.

16:07.280 --> 16:10.940
Most of the other articles floating around all sound like these handful that I've shown

16:10.940 --> 16:11.940
you.

16:11.940 --> 16:15.940
Lots of upper-class socialists running interference for big companies as they bizarrely like to

16:15.940 --> 16:16.940
do.

16:16.940 --> 16:20.300
Lots of journalists whining that they're no longer the great censor and that Trump

16:20.300 --> 16:24.680
is willing to simply sidestep them not just on Twitter anymore but in real life too.

16:24.680 --> 16:28.600
There's a sense of denial in labeling legitimate complaints as conspiracy theories, despite

16:28.600 --> 16:30.560
the mounting evidence to the contrary.

16:30.560 --> 16:35.480
The Veritas video, James Damore, YouTube's Trending tab being a joke, Facebook banning

16:35.480 --> 16:41.080
Paul Joseph Watson for no reason, Twitter's misgendering speech on Joe Rogan, Alex Jones'

16:41.080 --> 16:44.600
complete expulsion from the entire internet, Sargon's demonetization and removal from

16:44.600 --> 16:48.600
Patreon for a joke, Carlos Maza's VOD adpocalypse for Crowder's joke.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.760
Eventually, it stops being anecdotes and starts being evidence.

16:51.840 --> 16:56.840
The people who control the world's online speech all live and work in a very small,

16:56.840 --> 16:58.720
very radical section of California.

16:58.720 --> 17:02.480
They are not fit to be the gatekeepers of free thought any more than the mainstream

17:02.480 --> 17:05.280
journalists are fit to be the gatekeepers of the truth.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.520
They need to either shape up or be brought down.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.720
Let's hope Trump follows through.
