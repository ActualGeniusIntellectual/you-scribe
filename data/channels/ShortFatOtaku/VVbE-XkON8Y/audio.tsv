0	3520	So, President Trump hosted a social media summit.
3520	7600	As seen by this video on the official White House YouTube channel, President Trump hosts
7600	8600	a social media summit.
8600	13920	So this is a historic day, never before have so many online journalists and influencers
13920	19200	come together in this building to discuss the future of social media.
19200	22840	Each of you is fulfilling a vital role in our nation.
22840	28120	You're challenging the media gatekeepers and the corporate censors to bring the facts straight
28120	29960	to the American people.
29960	35360	Together you reach more people than any television broadcast network by far.
35360	38920	Free speech is a bedrock of American life.
38920	42600	Our constitutional rights must be fiercely protected.
42600	47320	And today I'm directing my administration to explore all regulatory and legislative
47320	54080	solutions to protect free speech and the free speech rights of all Americans.
55080	62840	You know, that music made it sound like it was some kind of epic movie moment or something.
62840	63840	Pretty cool.
63840	67120	Also, did anybody else chuckle at Tim Pool's beanie poking out from the crowd?
67120	68680	Hope it matched his suit.
68680	73840	But the old media was, as just about everybody predicted, absolutely furious that YouTubers
73840	78280	and internet personalities were invited to discuss the issue of social media censorship.
78280	81160	Or really, any issue at all, instead of them.
81240	84600	They believe that it's their sole right to determine what people think.
84600	86560	Or, in the words of Carlos Maza,
86560	90360	This is called gatekeeping, and it's one of the most important things journalists do.
90360	95640	For example, here's CNN talking about Trump's six false claims during the summit.
95640	97640	Let's take a quick look at them.
97640	101400	There is no evidence that Twitter or other social media companies have made it difficult
101400	102760	for people to follow Trump.
102760	106520	We obviously can't verify what certain people might have told Trump in private about following
106520	109360	him in social media, but following him is not complicated.
109560	113840	Doing so is simply a matter of signing up for an account, searching his name, and clicking
113840	114840	a single button.
114840	118400	I'm not surprised that CNN opens up with entry-level obfuscation.
118400	121840	You can't follow somebody on Twitter if you've been banned from Twitter.
121840	124920	And we all know that shadow banning also happens on Twitter too.
124920	129140	Yeah, Jack Dorsey testified to Congress that it doesn't, but there's also evidence that
129140	133980	Twitter turned its shadow banning off for that one day so he wouldn't be lying.
133980	138440	Trump touted the low unemployment rate for women, saying it's the best in 75 years.
138440	139600	Trump exaggerated slightly.
139600	146000	The woman's unemployment rate for June is 3.6%, a tick above the 3.4% in April and 3.5%
146000	147000	in May.
147000	150700	Those are excellent numbers, but it has been 66 years since the woman's rate has been
150700	152040	this low, not 75.
152040	155040	Oh no, I guess CNN's got you there, Trump.
155040	159080	On something completely trivial, Trump said they go through houses, they go up, they ring
159080	160540	doorbells, they talk to people.
160540	161680	How many toilets do they have?
161680	163120	How many desks do they have?
163120	164120	How many beds?
164120	165120	What's their roof made of?
165120	169040	Only thing we can't ask is, are you a citizen of the United States?
169040	173040	Trump is wrongly suggesting that the decennial census asks households about the number of
173040	174100	toilets in a house.
174100	178420	He could be referring to supplemental surveys from the Census Bureau, which do ask questions
178420	180820	about living conditions of a small sample of households.
180820	185840	If that's the case, then he's still wrong, since those surveys do ask questions of citizenship.
185840	190040	I'm sure technically he is wrong, but when I read that passage, it sounds to me he's
190040	194180	saying that the government is empowered to ask a bunch of trivial questions, but is hamstrung
194180	197620	to ask questions that are actually its business, like citizenship.
197620	202100	But more importantly, if these supplemental surveys do ask questions of citizenship, why
202100	204140	are you so opposed to asking everyone?
204140	205620	You seem to be okay with it here.
205620	210460	There were nowhere close to 21,000 people outside the rally as Trump was speaking, and
210460	215300	the arena had a capacity of 20,000 that night, not many more than 21,000.
215300	220100	Yeah, this is something the media likes to do, argue with Trump over his crowd size.
220100	223460	I'm sure there are times when Trump's blowing up his crowd numbers to look good,
223740	226520	and I'm sure there are times when the media lies to make him look bad.
226520	229580	My only real question is, why do you bother doing this, CNN?
229580	234060	I think everybody knows that Trump's an egotistical blowhard, but that's his brand,
234060	237780	that's not CNN's brand, so when you get into a slap fight with him over this stuff
237780	239100	you just look petty.
239100	244140	You look at Biden, they say he had 600 people, that wasn't 600, that was 150 people.
244140	248620	Independent observers reported that Joe Biden did indeed have 600 people at his first public
248620	252540	event after announcing his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination.
252620	256260	Oh god, now you're doing the same thing just the other way around, now you're playing
256260	260740	the numbers game for your guy but pumping them up, the same way Trump does to his own.
260740	265460	Who cares man, you're a news organization, talk about the issues, not this high school
265460	267460	popularity contest nonsense.
267460	271020	Maybe you think the best way to influence people is through peer pressure, but most
271020	272620	of us grew out of that a long time ago.
272620	275140	I know I'm not done with the article yet, but you know what I just realized?
275140	278820	CNN hasn't talked about the meat of the social media summit at all.
278820	282980	In this article, talking about the social media summit, CNN has chosen to spend their
282980	286660	one click that we might give them, nitpicking Trump over nothing.
286660	289460	I hope that was worth it CNN, because I'm never coming back.
289460	291020	How about MSNBC?
291020	296500	Trump's closed door social media summit is pretty spooky, I presume by closed door
296500	299860	you mean invite only and I wasn't invited.
299860	303220	President Trump's social media summit is a primer for the 2020 race.
303220	307900	Attendees, known for everything from dank memes to conspiracy theories, will be meeting
307900	308980	with the president.
308980	311180	Dank memes are the new social scare guys.
311180	316440	It was rock and roll for a while, then comics, then D&D, video games, and now it's memes.
316440	339680	Think of the children.
339680	343520	Of course they deny any censorship, they're the ones being accused of it.
343520	347680	And when the president accuses you of censorship, if you've got no plans to actually change,
347680	349280	your best hope really is to double down.
349280	352480	But more to the point, I thought you guys on the radical left were all about believing
352480	353480	the victims.
353480	359160	You seem to have thrown your hat in with the accused pretty quickly this time.
359160	361760	They weren't invited because they are the problem.
361760	365880	It's not a summit with social media, it's a summit about social media, hearing from
365880	369320	the independent voices that use it, who are affected by its policies.
369320	373200	Again, the social media companies are the accused, not the victim.
373200	377560	And I know you know this, because the mainstream media reported on it, but big names in social
377560	381680	media have already been to the White House to give their take on things back in April.
381680	386020	They've had their say, and the only reason you're crying foul is because we're finally
386020	387480	getting to have ours too.
387480	391320	We also know that on the list of provocateurs who are on that list, Ali Alexander-
391320	393200	Wait, wait, wait, provocateurs?
393200	394960	Tim Pool is a provocateur?
394960	398920	Also, you do realize the guy's face is in every single one of his videos, right?
398920	401560	There's no reason to have some anonymous shadow image.
401560	402760	Here, you know what?
402760	405960	Here, I fixed your video for you, I just did your job.
405960	407840	I'm better at this than MSNBC.
407840	412800	Listen, this is legitimizing people who otherwise wouldn't have had such a big platform to
412800	415200	talk about trolling, harassment, disinformation, etc.
415200	416840	Yeah, that's the point.
416840	420300	It's legitimizing people who don't have a big platform, specifically because the only
420300	424600	reason they do not is due to Silicon Valley putting their thumb on the scales.
424600	428580	Algorithms get tweaked, posts get censored, accounts get banned, all in such a way to
428580	432200	limit the discoverability of independent voices and promote mainstream ones.
432240	435240	White House exposure is just one way to level the playing field.
435240	439260	Trump has largely invited people who have earned their legitimization, but have had
439260	442120	it unfairly taken away from them by the social media cartel.
442120	448080	You know, if you talk to disinformation researchers about this, they all make these network graphs
448080	453520	that show sort of the range and scope of disinformation and how it travels.
453520	456640	And a lot of these people are at the center of these network graphs.
456640	458860	Oh, you mean that alternate influence piece of garbage?
458860	462620	You know, that report that showed all of these politically very different YouTubers
462620	466540	all linked together as part of some alt-right network, solely because they debated each
466540	468460	other or appeared together or whatever?
468460	473660	Yeah, see, when I look at this, I see a group of people who have almost nothing in common,
473660	475460	except that they're not radical leftists.
475460	476460	That's it.
476460	481500	There's basic conservatives, trad thoughts, centrists, classical liberals, center lefties,
481500	487260	white nationalists, trolls, basically all possible groups except card-carrying progressives.
487260	489180	Actually, no, because destiny is on there.
489180	503460	Your research is trash.
503460	507100	That's because Tim Pool is a center lefty who's not willing to cede the left to the
507100	509120	radicals, and I kind of view myself the same way.
509120	513640	I'm still center left, and I still spend most of my time criticizing the radical left,
513640	518120	because at this point, the radical left has gone so far off the deep end that they're
518120	521200	more of a threat than the radical right, even from a center left point of view.
521200	524800	The neo-Nazis might be dangerous, but at least there's only a couple thousand of them.
524800	528920	Antifa is absolutely everywhere, attacking civilians and journalists with impunity.
528920	533460	I want to say it's almost entirely people who push innuendo on the internet.
533460	534880	This is not about censorship.
534880	538560	This is about protecting a strategy for 2020.
538560	543880	You know, Brad Parscale, who ran Trump's digital campaign in 2016, now runs the 2020
543880	544880	campaign.
544880	548360	They understand how important it is to get innuendo out about candidates, and innuendo
548360	552160	about enemies of Donald Trump out into the public sphere.
552160	555040	When he says innuendo, he's referring to two things.
555040	556040	One, memes.
556040	557040	Think of the children.
557040	562760	Two, more importantly, an unfiltered truth, untouched by the bias and the rhetoric and
562760	566000	the agenda of the mainstream media, a truth without gatekeeping.
566000	569880	An internet full of independent creators of all political persuasions allows the public
569880	573840	to see the full story and make up their own minds on context and interpretation.
573840	578360	Yes, it puts responsibility on the viewer to not be a sheep, but that's how we want
578360	579360	it to be.
579360	582080	But let's move on to the unholy trinity of villainy.
582080	584620	Vice, Vox, and The Verge.
584620	590680	Trump invites fringe social media company popular with Nazis to the White House.
590680	594960	Minds features far-right figures the same way that Facebook and Twitter do.
594960	596680	Far-right individuals use the platform.
596680	597940	What's next, Vice?
597940	603160	A headline like, far-right figures may be communicating via commonly used cell phone
603160	604160	carriers?
604160	609560	In fact, in this article, Vice says Minds was once home to several neo-Nazi extremist
609560	610560	groups.
610560	612320	Yeah, again, so was Twitter and Facebook.
612320	616560	It doesn't even matter that Minds banned those groups, because it's been put on their
616560	617560	permanent record.
617560	621400	You know, when I finished high school, I figured we'd have put this kind of nonsense behind
621400	622400	us.
622400	625840	The man-children activists over at Vice are still keeping score.
625840	630160	The summit will be attended by an assortment of individuals connected to nationalist movements,
630160	634560	QAnon, and anti-Semitic conspiracies surrounding George Soros.
634560	638440	I don't know much about QAnon, they seem on the surface like a more right-leaning,
638440	641040	less reliable version of Veritas, so whatever.
641040	644680	But Trump's a nationalist, so there's no surprise that he invited nationalists to
644680	645680	his shindig.
645680	649300	And as for Soros, it's not really a conspiracy theory when you publicly admit what you're
649300	651040	doing in your own words, is it?
651040	657080	Tim Pool, a right-wing media figure who once worked at Vice News, tweeted an invitation
657080	658080	to the summit.
658080	661560	Oh, oh, Vice, are you admitting to being a right-wing publication?
661560	664560	Because that's what I'm reading here when I put on my social justice glasses.
664560	666940	Here, just let me write another headline, okay?
666940	672720	Right-wing publication Vice exposed as once having employed YouTube beanie enthusiast
672720	673720	Tim Pool.
673720	674720	There.
674720	676400	That's about the quality of your reporting, isn't it?
676400	680880	Honestly, the whole thing just sounds like whining about independent voices finally breaking
680880	684820	free from the mainstream jackboot that's been pressed against their necks ever since
684820	685820	Trump took office.
685820	689600	Vice, the reason that you weren't invited is because you're the one wearing the boots.
689600	692220	Another article from Vice called the summit bonkers.
692220	696960	It brought up that Project Veritas's James O'Keefe attended, labeling him, again, a
696960	701960	provocateur, as well as the fact that Twitter went down for the day just as hashtag social
701960	705660	media summit began blowing up, calling it yet another conspiracy theory.
705660	707440	But there's not much here that's really different.
707440	711320	It's just a bunch of journalists whining and activists running interference for big
711320	712320	tech.
712320	713320	Here's Vox's take.
713320	715200	Trump's social media summit was a circus.
715200	716600	Its aftermath was even worse.
716600	719200	Oh yeah, that picture there, I saw the video to that.
719200	722600	Gorka strode up to reporter Brian Karam and called him a punk?
722600	724200	Wait, that's not what the video showed.
724200	725200	Don't be sad.
725200	726200	Don't be sad.
726200	727200	No, I'm just standing around.
727200	728200	This is a group of people that are eager for demonic possession.
728200	729200	demonic possession.
729200	730200	And you're a journalist, right?
730200	731200	That's right.
731200	732200	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
732200	733200	Hey, come over here and talk to me, brother.
733200	734200	We can go outside and have a long conversation.
734200	735200	You're threatening me now in the white house.
735200	736200	You're threatening me in the rose garden.
736200	737200	You are a punk.
737200	738200	You're not a journalist.
738200	739200	You're a punk.
739200	740200	Go home.
740200	741200	Go home.
741200	742200	Hey, Gorka, get a job.
742200	760920	Hey, just for the record, he'd kick your punk ass.
760920	765520	Yeah, the video showed Brian threatening to start a fight, daring Gorka to step forward.
765520	769600	And when he did, all Brian could do is fold his hands in front of him like a chump.
769600	771740	And Vox, you really think it's Gorka's fault?
771740	774320	The journalist cries out in pain as he strikes you.
774320	778280	The goal of the White House Social Media Summit wasn't actually to highlight bias that social
778280	782200	media companies have against conservatives or other groups, because there's no evidence
782200	783680	such bias exists.
783680	784840	Are you kidding me?
784840	785840	Really?
785840	787120	Are you guys this ridiculous?
787120	789520	Let's do a few quick searches on incognito.
789520	791240	Here's one everyone knows about.
791240	792940	Feminist own compilation.
792940	793940	Top result.
793940	795920	Why office air conditioning is sexist.
795920	796920	Really?
796920	798220	This is not at all what I was looking for.
798220	800240	Ben Shapiro's feud with Rosie O'Donnell.
800240	802280	Top 10 feminist moments of 2018.
802280	803560	Women debate fat acceptance.
803560	806960	It eventually recommends a channel full of what I actually searched for.
806960	808360	Compilations of feminists getting owned.
808360	811020	With views in the millions on many of its videos.
811020	813120	But none of those videos appear in the actual search.
813120	814280	How about the topic of today?
814280	815520	The Social Media Summit.
815520	816520	Fox.
816520	817520	VOA News.
817520	818520	MSNBC.

821520	822520	Etc.
822520	823520	Etc.
823520	824520	Not a single YouTuber discussing the event.
824520	826040	Despite the videos made by YouTubers having way more hits.
826040	828840	And the event being about YouTubers.
828840	830480	What's on YouTube's trending tab?
830480	832200	Okay, mostly Normie vomit.
832200	833200	Wait, wait, wait.
833200	834280	Creator on the rise?
834280	836200	I get more hits than these chumps.
836200	837840	Where's my on the rise status?
837840	839160	How about on the news trending?
839160	840200	Oh, surprise, surprise.
840200	842360	It's all of the alphabet networks again.
842360	843360	Check this out.

846360	850200	I'm not usually one to brag, but even I get more views in that span of time.
850200	856000	When Vox says no bias exists, either they're painfully bad at their job, or their camp
856000	858200	benefits from the bias that exists.
858200	861920	And finally on the verge, the White House Social Media Summit was full of hypocrisy
861920	862920	and comedy.
862920	865720	I half expected the byline to say, and that's a bad thing.
865720	869160	The stuff that conservative voices think of does not always reach the maximum possible
869160	870160	audience.
870160	873860	Sometimes conservatives do not appear as high as they would like to in search results.
873860	876080	Sometimes they get suspended or even banned.
876080	880540	This has led to much conspiratorial thinking that liberal leaning Silicon Valley is throttling
880540	883680	their access in an effort to tip the scales of democracy.
883680	885080	It's not a conspiracy theory.
885080	887080	We've all seen the Project Veritas video.
887080	890320	Silicon Valley has tried to scrub the internet of it, but we've all seen it.
890320	891460	It's still up on Bitchute.
891460	892720	We all know the truth.
892720	894840	This is their actual plan.
894840	898600	Conservatives typically take great pains to protect the free market from undue interference
898600	902520	from the government, but social networks are powerful enough that, in this case, Republicans
902520	903840	intend to intervene.
903840	905440	And they absolutely need to.
905440	910620	Social media and journalists, and many others since 2016 hell, since 2014, have began to
910620	914520	publicly misbehave so bad that it beggars belief.
914520	919040	Before Gamergate and Brexit and Trump, these people still did all of this nonsense, but
919040	921640	they did it silently and quietly and in private.
921640	925220	But as soon as the public became aware of it, it's almost like these people said screw
925220	926220	it.
926220	927220	They already know the truth.
927220	930260	Let's open the open and ramp it up to 11 because the jig is up and they can't stop
930260	931260	us anyway.
931260	935060	Elsewhere, Senator Josh Hawley has proposed legislation that would require large social
935060	939020	networks to treat every political opinion equally, which would be great news for Nazis.
939020	943940	But even in such a world, feed-based platforms will still have to rank and recommend content.
943940	946820	Many Conservative complaints revolve around the fact that they do not always rank at the
946820	947820	top.
947820	951720	No, the complaint is that their rankings are not actually listed in order of their rank,
951720	952720	which is what you'd expect.
952720	956020	The Trending tab on YouTube might as well be called YouTube-approved content because
956020	958500	it's got nothing to do with what's actually trending.
958500	962300	Feed-based platforms do not have to recommend content at all, and the only thing they have
962300	967280	to do to rank content properly is simply present it in order of popularity.
967280	970940	Most of the other articles floating around all sound like these handful that I've shown
970940	971940	you.
971940	975940	Lots of upper-class socialists running interference for big companies as they bizarrely like to
975940	976940	do.
976940	980300	Lots of journalists whining that they're no longer the great censor and that Trump
980300	984680	is willing to simply sidestep them not just on Twitter anymore but in real life too.
984680	988600	There's a sense of denial in labeling legitimate complaints as conspiracy theories, despite
988600	990560	the mounting evidence to the contrary.
990560	995480	The Veritas video, James Damore, YouTube's Trending tab being a joke, Facebook banning
995480	1001080	Paul Joseph Watson for no reason, Twitter's misgendering speech on Joe Rogan, Alex Jones'
1001080	1004600	complete expulsion from the entire internet, Sargon's demonetization and removal from
1004600	1008600	Patreon for a joke, Carlos Maza's VOD adpocalypse for Crowder's joke.
1008600	1011760	Eventually, it stops being anecdotes and starts being evidence.
1011840	1016840	The people who control the world's online speech all live and work in a very small,
1016840	1018720	very radical section of California.
1018720	1022480	They are not fit to be the gatekeepers of free thought any more than the mainstream
1022480	1025280	journalists are fit to be the gatekeepers of the truth.
1025280	1027520	They need to either shape up or be brought down.
1027520	1028720	Let's hope Trump follows through.
