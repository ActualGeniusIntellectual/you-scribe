00:00.000 --> 00:11.880
Now for 2,000 years, from classical Greece and Rome, all the way through classical liberalism,

00:11.880 --> 00:15.580
such ideas were considered an abomination.

00:15.580 --> 00:21.220
The idea that you should be subject to somebody else's will, the idea that it's a wonderful

00:21.220 --> 00:29.620
thing to have a job, it's a wonderful thing to spend most of your waking life as the

00:29.620 --> 00:36.780
servant of a tyrant who has more power over you than Stalin ever dreamed of.

00:36.780 --> 00:43.140
Stalin never said, you can have a bathroom break at 3 p.m. for five minutes, or here

00:43.140 --> 00:45.140
are the kinds of clothes you have to wear.

00:45.140 --> 00:49.780
So it seems like you have some similarities with Jordan Peterson on this issue, and I

00:49.780 --> 00:54.340
wanted to know if you had any disagreements with what he says.

00:54.340 --> 00:57.860
Frankly, I'd pay very little attention.

00:57.860 --> 01:02.700
I mean, there's some issues, which I probably agree with Hitler, it doesn't mean much.

01:02.700 --> 01:08.500
Vast outcry of outrage over the communist monsters who were carrying out this horrifying

01:08.500 --> 01:11.900
bloodbath and so on and so forth.

01:11.900 --> 01:16.060
Interestingly, in all of this, there was a tremendous amount of fabrication, just plain

01:16.060 --> 01:28.580
fabrication of evidence.
