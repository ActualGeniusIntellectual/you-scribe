0	11880	Now for 2,000 years, from classical Greece and Rome, all the way through classical liberalism,
11880	15580	such ideas were considered an abomination.
15580	21220	The idea that you should be subject to somebody else's will, the idea that it's a wonderful
21220	29620	thing to have a job, it's a wonderful thing to spend most of your waking life as the
29620	36780	servant of a tyrant who has more power over you than Stalin ever dreamed of.
36780	43140	Stalin never said, you can have a bathroom break at 3 p.m. for five minutes, or here
43140	45140	are the kinds of clothes you have to wear.

62700	68500	Vast outcry of outrage over the communist monsters who were carrying out this horrifying
68500	71900	bloodbath and so on and so forth.
71900	76060	Interestingly, in all of this, there was a tremendous amount of fabrication, just plain
76060	88580	fabrication of evidence.
