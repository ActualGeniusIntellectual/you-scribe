1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
Recently, I decided to go back and see what Yahtzee's been doing.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,400
You know, the Zero Punctuation guy.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,080
The only reason The Escapist became a relevant platform due to their signing him on exclusively.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,200
I remember watching ZP religiously for the first couple of years, but I eventually just

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,200
fell out of it.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,800
I didn't really turn on him or anything, I never stopped liking his stuff, I just one

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,640
day forgot to go check out the new update, and that was that.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,920
But considering how absolutely cucked the game's media is right now, and The Escapist

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,760
specifically, with the whole bringing back movie bob thing, and the apologizing to Zoe

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,920
Quinn for actually talking about ethics in journalism thing, I predicted that Yahtzee

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,200
would have cucked out like the rest of them, that the establishment would have worn his

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,520
fine edge into a dull, pathetic, blunted caricature of what he once was.

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,220
Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised.

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,560
He still had all of the acid and wit that I remembered from the early days.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,460
He even made a joke at the expense of the Ghostbusters reboot and Hollywood's recent

16
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,840
trend of blaming fans when their shitty movies failed to make any money.

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,680
I was actually a little overjoyed, and I spent the rest of the afternoon binge watching

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,400
ZP while eating chocolate covered almonds and beef jerky.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,640
It seems like as my viewing habits regressed to an earlier state, so did my eating habits.

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,240
Back to a time when I was much, much fatter.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,360
Anyway, the reason I was pleasantly surprised is because most of the internet personalities

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,020
from around 2009 have either vanished into obscurity or mutated into social justice infected

23
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,400
variations of their former selves, still living off the viral videos from their glory

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
days.

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,980
Not totally understanding that the reason they're now struggling to keep up is because

26
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,020
everything that made them great back then is exactly what they've sacrificed at the

27
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,180
altar of social justice.

28
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,020
Here's a great example of what I mean.

29
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,260
From Linkara's Twitter.

30
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,420
Okay guys, I know I gave a positive review of the Tomb Raider comic, but it's actually

31
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,500
kind of rude to at creators with reviews of their work.

32
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,940
It doesn't help that since my show is intended to focus on the negative stuff, description

33
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,780
of the video might give them the wrong idea.

34
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,820
I never thought I'd see the day where the angry reviewers of yesteryear cucked out so

35
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,900
fucking hard that they blatantly admit that by their own warped definitions, their own

36
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,200
show, their own body of work is toxic and hateful.

37
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,780
Angry reviewers review bad stuff, they're angry for a reason, it's a part of the gag.

38
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,380
If that's now problematic in the current year, why are you still doing your show Linkara?

39
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,580
And then there's the obvious example, Spoonie.

40
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,700
Six months since a gaming stream from him, two years since a vlog, and what is it, three

41
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,060
years since a review?

42
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,640
But oh boy, he can certainly spend 18 hours a day tweeting about Trump, that's for sure.

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,860
In between whining about having no money and all of his various diseases of course.

44
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,700
I honestly don't know how April hasn't dumped him by now.

45
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,140
Maybe it's because she's an SJW herself, and Spoonie has morphed into the perfect soft

46
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,620
boy for her tastes.

47
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,280
This one's actually really sad for me guys, I made a vlog a couple years ago where I describe

48
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,940
how Spoonie was the inspiration for us to start our channel and stuff, and I once considered

49
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,340
him the absolute best YouTuber out there.

50
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,780
The personalities that have blown up in the past 5 years haven't been explicitly anti-SJW,

51
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,340
although those people have had their fair share of successes too, but it's been those

52
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,380
that are largely apolitical.

53
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,320
They have a slight shitlord-y bent, sure, but I honestly think that's just the natural

54
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,980
state of the average person, to recoil at the sight of social justice.

55
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,420
But they, for the most part, keep their shows out of the political sphere, only bringing

56
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,060
it in when it's relevant.

57
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:19,140
AVGN's channel is still going strong after like 13 years of operation, because regardless

58
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,620
of politics he sticks to what he knows.

59
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,220
Nerd videos are largely apolitical, sure, but when it came time to speak out about the

60
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,460
2016 Ghostbusters reboot, he did so as fairly as he could.

61
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,740
It didn't stop the SJWs from throwing temper tantrums over it, sure, but he wasn't hyperbolic

62
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,740
on the topic.

63
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,740
Aside from JonTron's dumpster fire debate with Destiny, he's stuck to what he knows

64
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,980
too, and his videos have never been better.

65
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,980
These guys are cut from the same cloth as Spoonie and Linkara.

66
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,620
They come from the same era, and yet they're wildly more successful.

67
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,420
Not because they're anti-SJW, but because they ignore SJWs entirely.

68
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,460
And there does seem to be a serious correlation between people that aren't SJWs, and the

69
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,860
amount and quality of work they produce.

70
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,260
This is pretty obvious to me.

71
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,900
Liberals talk about rights, while Conservatives talk about responsibilities, and the proper

72
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,880
balance of those two forces is in the middle.

73
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,220
If things are too right-leaning, then it's all responsibility and no rights, a fascist

74
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,220
right.

75
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,220
If things are too left-leaning, then it's all rights and no responsibility.

76
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,860
And society naturally breaks down, because there are more people owed more things through

77
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,700
the virtue of their rights, than there are people responsible to go out into the world

78
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,240
and actually procure those things that are owed.

79
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,580
So it's no surprise to me that SJW YouTubers lack the work ethic to maintain a successful

80
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,180
career over not just years, but potentially decades.

81
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,420
Too many rights, and not enough responsibility.

82
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:40,080
And it also makes perfect sense that SJWs would hate people more successful than them.

83
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,760
Because successful people get to enjoy the fruits of their labour.

84
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,560
Fruits that SJWs believe they're owed through the rights they claim to have.

85
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,080
In my video on Why Capitalism is Successful, I stated my belief that upper-middle-class

86
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,300
Socialists and Communists who claim to want to help the poor, don't actually want to

87
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,300
help the poor, but simply hate those who are richer than them.

88
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,220
They clothe their desire to steal from those more successful than they are, in a layer

89
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,400
of false humanitarianism for the working class, confirmed to be false because of how little

90
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,700
resources actually get into the hands of the working class once any socialist government

91
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
takes power.

92
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,040
This is just conjecture on my part.

93
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,720
But I think this is related to the Chinese idea of three generations.

94
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,320
Where the grandfather is working class, but understands that he must work hard to build

95
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,540
a better life for his family.

96
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,860
The father is middle class, who watched the grandfather work himself to death, and wants

97
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,660
his son to avoid that fate.

98
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,520
And the son is upper class, has never suffered a day in his life, doesn't understand the

99
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,080
bubble of privilege his family has constructed for him.

100
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,500
And his lack of ability to contend with the harshness of the world leads to the ruin of

101
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,480
his family, and the return to the grandfather stage in the next generation.

102
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,820
In English, this idea is expressed through the similar saying of, hard times create tough

103
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,740
people, tough people create easy times, easy times create soft people, soft people create

104
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,880
hard times.

105
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,800
Things really do seem to work in a cyclical manner like that.

106
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,580
And whenever I see a social justice warrior wearing thousands of dollars of clothing,

107
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,980
stuff that a working class member would never be able to afford, holding a sign saying eat

108
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,580
the rich, what I see is a soft person creating hard times.

109
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,660
I see the son, standing on the precipice of the ruination of his family.

110
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,700
And for these rich kids, the dreaded 1% they're railing against is almost always going to

111
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,580
contain members of their family.

112
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:23,140
And from my point of view, it seems like these people are so entitled, so ridiculously, monstrously

113
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,220
egotistical, that they're dragging their family conflicts out into the political sphere.

114
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:32,180
Agitating for the radical restructuring and ultimate downfall of western civilization,

115
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,480
because they can't get along with their fucking dads.

116
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,740
This view has been making itself known recently with an extreme hatred of people with $1 billion,

117
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,840
regardless of any other attributes of the person.

118
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,220
They could be any race or gender, they could be hard working to the point that they legitimately

119
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,020
earned that billion, doesn't matter.

120
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,620
If they've got 10 digits in the old bank account, they deserve to be hated.

121
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,300
Anyone who has a billion dollars either exploited a monopoly that should have been broken up,

122
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,300
got inside information available to other investors, bribed some politicians, or inherited

123
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,680
the money from their parents who did one of the above.

124
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,800
These people don't understand how fucking hard CEOs actually work.

125
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,440
A college kid's perception of a CEO is a fat cat sitting in an office smoking a cigar,

126
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,520
watching the money roll in.

127
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,720
But that's not a person, that's the monopoly man.

128
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,880
A CEO is a CEO because they've worked for 80 hours a week for 50 years with no breaks.

129
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,440
A CEO is a CEO because they get up and work at 3am when their overseas client calls them

130
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,880
at demanding a fix to a problem that's about to cost the company $100 million, and if the

131
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,680
CEO doesn't fix it right now, there are many younger, hungrier competitors that are willing

132
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,320
to snap that contract up and make a fortune for themselves.

133
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,840
CEOs are CEOs because they consist of largely hyper-productive people who are incapable

134
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,620
of taking breaks, and they are an extreme minority of cases in the human condition.

135
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,500
Most women and most men are not these people.

136
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,340
These people are the 1%, not just in terms of their assets, but in terms of how fucking

137
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,340
rare they are.

138
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,480
Why should anyone have a billion dollars?

139
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,560
Why should anyone be proud to brandish their billions when there is so much suffering in

140
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
the world?

141
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,680
Because the billionaire likely earned it by working harder than every single employee

142
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,360
at the New York Times by a factor of 10.

143
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,940
And if you're going to remove the extreme rewards from extreme work, then who's going

144
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,940
to do the work?

145
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,840
That's what happens in a socialist country.

146
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,760
The productive class gets wiped out because there's no longer any reason to be productive,

147
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,200
and the economy grinds to a halt.

148
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,160
I know this will sound terrible to SJWs, but it makes sense that old rich people are old

149
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
and rich.

150
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,440
If you have any sense, money is something you'll attempt to accumulate across your life.

151
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,960
You trade in your youthful potential for your wealthy old age, but you're still going to

152
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
be old.

153
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,800
Would you willingly make that trade with the snap of your fingers and miss out on 50 years

154
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
of your life?

155
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,520
The only reason you're not rich yet is because you haven't put in enough hours on this planet

156
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,180
to be rich, you spoiled brats.

157
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:52,680
This analysis works not just on sub-accounts or dollars in the bank, but in sports, in

158
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:58,160
video games, in grades at school, in any domain in which there is a relatively objective measurement

159
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
of success.

160
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,360
I'd say there's two hard and fast rules.

161
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,280
One, if there's an objective measurement of success, the majority of successes will

162
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,180
be clustered around a small minority of people at the top of the hierarchy, as predicted

163
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,600
by the Pareto Principle.

164
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,280
Two, social justice warriors will object to this distribution of success as being a product

165
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,160
of privilege and oppression, when in reality it's a product of talent, intelligence, and

166
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,960
disproportionate amount of time invested in the pursuit.

167
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,920
And I think on some level the progressives must know this.

168
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,200
If our society truly was nothing but a power struggle, with no hierarchies of competence

169
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,980
involved whatsoever, why is the power on every time you come home?

170
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,440
Why do supply lines keep the food moving from farm to warehouse to grocery store?

171
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,220
Even if there is some corruption, and I'm sure there is, at some point there has to

172
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,860
be competent people doing real work somewhere in the chain.

173
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,440
Things do not run themselves.

174
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,200
In fact, things break themselves down ridiculously quickly without competent intervention.

175
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
What's the statistic?

176
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,360
A helicopter needs eight hours of work for one hour of flight, something like that?

177
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,680
Do you really think a society comprised of nothing but power grabs could even keep them

178
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,680
in the air?

179
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,920
It would seem to me that the tendency of both the social justice warrior and the communist

180
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,440
to hate the successful stems from a hatred of themselves and their own inadequacies.

181
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,800
Or maybe it stems from a complete and total ignorance about the inner machinations of

182
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,320
society, something that their rich parents have shielded them from the whole time.

183
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,920
Or maybe it stems from something else.

184
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,880
I started this video talking about failed YouTubers.

185
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,080
Because hating the successful is not something limited to billionaires.

186
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,280
The mainstream media hates PewDiePie because he's a guy who makes silly voices and plays

187
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,760
video games, and he has a larger audience than almost every old media outlet on the

188
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
planet.

189
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,600
AVGN and JonTron got flack because they refused to conform to the proper political positions.

190
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,120
These are people that are not only just successful, but are also out of the control of social

191
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,120
justice.

192
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,840
You'll notice that social justice individuals that are also successful get a lot less flack,

193
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
right?

194
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,080
Maybe that's because it's never been about hating the successful at all.

195
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,600
Maybe it's because it's been about hating the unbowed.
