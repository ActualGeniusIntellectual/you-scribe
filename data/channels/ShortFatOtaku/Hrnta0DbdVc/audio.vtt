00:00.000 --> 00:03.640
Recently, I decided to go back and see what Yahtzee's been doing.

00:03.640 --> 00:05.400
You know, the Zero Punctuation guy.

00:05.400 --> 00:10.080
The only reason The Escapist became a relevant platform due to their signing him on exclusively.

00:10.080 --> 00:14.200
I remember watching ZP religiously for the first couple of years, but I eventually just

00:14.200 --> 00:15.200
fell out of it.

00:15.200 --> 00:18.800
I didn't really turn on him or anything, I never stopped liking his stuff, I just one

00:18.800 --> 00:21.640
day forgot to go check out the new update, and that was that.

00:21.640 --> 00:25.920
But considering how absolutely cucked the game's media is right now, and The Escapist

00:25.920 --> 00:30.760
specifically, with the whole bringing back movie bob thing, and the apologizing to Zoe

00:30.760 --> 00:34.920
Quinn for actually talking about ethics in journalism thing, I predicted that Yahtzee

00:34.920 --> 00:38.200
would have cucked out like the rest of them, that the establishment would have worn his

00:38.200 --> 00:42.520
fine edge into a dull, pathetic, blunted caricature of what he once was.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.220
Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised.

00:44.220 --> 00:47.560
He still had all of the acid and wit that I remembered from the early days.

00:47.560 --> 00:51.460
He even made a joke at the expense of the Ghostbusters reboot and Hollywood's recent

00:51.460 --> 00:54.840
trend of blaming fans when their shitty movies failed to make any money.

00:54.840 --> 00:58.680
I was actually a little overjoyed, and I spent the rest of the afternoon binge watching

00:58.680 --> 01:02.400
ZP while eating chocolate covered almonds and beef jerky.

01:02.400 --> 01:07.640
It seems like as my viewing habits regressed to an earlier state, so did my eating habits.

01:07.640 --> 01:10.240
Back to a time when I was much, much fatter.

01:10.240 --> 01:14.360
Anyway, the reason I was pleasantly surprised is because most of the internet personalities

01:14.360 --> 01:20.020
from around 2009 have either vanished into obscurity or mutated into social justice infected

01:20.020 --> 01:24.400
variations of their former selves, still living off the viral videos from their glory

01:24.400 --> 01:25.400
days.

01:25.400 --> 01:28.980
Not totally understanding that the reason they're now struggling to keep up is because

01:28.980 --> 01:33.020
everything that made them great back then is exactly what they've sacrificed at the

01:33.020 --> 01:34.180
altar of social justice.

01:34.180 --> 01:36.020
Here's a great example of what I mean.

01:36.020 --> 01:37.260
From Linkara's Twitter.

01:37.260 --> 01:41.420
Okay guys, I know I gave a positive review of the Tomb Raider comic, but it's actually

01:41.420 --> 01:44.500
kind of rude to at creators with reviews of their work.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.940
It doesn't help that since my show is intended to focus on the negative stuff, description

01:47.940 --> 01:49.780
of the video might give them the wrong idea.

01:49.780 --> 01:54.820
I never thought I'd see the day where the angry reviewers of yesteryear cucked out so

01:54.820 --> 01:59.900
fucking hard that they blatantly admit that by their own warped definitions, their own

01:59.900 --> 02:03.200
show, their own body of work is toxic and hateful.

02:03.200 --> 02:07.780
Angry reviewers review bad stuff, they're angry for a reason, it's a part of the gag.

02:07.780 --> 02:12.380
If that's now problematic in the current year, why are you still doing your show Linkara?

02:12.380 --> 02:14.580
And then there's the obvious example, Spoonie.

02:14.580 --> 02:18.700
Six months since a gaming stream from him, two years since a vlog, and what is it, three

02:18.740 --> 02:20.060
years since a review?

02:20.060 --> 02:24.640
But oh boy, he can certainly spend 18 hours a day tweeting about Trump, that's for sure.

02:24.640 --> 02:28.860
In between whining about having no money and all of his various diseases of course.

02:28.860 --> 02:31.700
I honestly don't know how April hasn't dumped him by now.

02:31.700 --> 02:36.140
Maybe it's because she's an SJW herself, and Spoonie has morphed into the perfect soft

02:36.140 --> 02:37.620
boy for her tastes.

02:37.620 --> 02:41.280
This one's actually really sad for me guys, I made a vlog a couple years ago where I describe

02:41.280 --> 02:45.940
how Spoonie was the inspiration for us to start our channel and stuff, and I once considered

02:45.940 --> 02:49.340
him the absolute best YouTuber out there.

02:49.340 --> 02:54.780
The personalities that have blown up in the past 5 years haven't been explicitly anti-SJW,

02:54.780 --> 02:58.340
although those people have had their fair share of successes too, but it's been those

02:58.340 --> 03:00.380
that are largely apolitical.

03:00.380 --> 03:04.320
They have a slight shitlord-y bent, sure, but I honestly think that's just the natural

03:04.320 --> 03:07.980
state of the average person, to recoil at the sight of social justice.

03:07.980 --> 03:12.420
But they, for the most part, keep their shows out of the political sphere, only bringing

03:12.420 --> 03:14.060
it in when it's relevant.

03:14.060 --> 03:19.140
AVGN's channel is still going strong after like 13 years of operation, because regardless

03:19.140 --> 03:21.620
of politics he sticks to what he knows.

03:21.620 --> 03:25.220
Nerd videos are largely apolitical, sure, but when it came time to speak out about the

03:25.220 --> 03:29.460
2016 Ghostbusters reboot, he did so as fairly as he could.

03:29.460 --> 03:33.740
It didn't stop the SJWs from throwing temper tantrums over it, sure, but he wasn't hyperbolic

03:33.740 --> 03:34.740
on the topic.

03:34.740 --> 03:38.740
Aside from JonTron's dumpster fire debate with Destiny, he's stuck to what he knows

03:38.740 --> 03:40.980
too, and his videos have never been better.

03:40.980 --> 03:43.980
These guys are cut from the same cloth as Spoonie and Linkara.

03:43.980 --> 03:47.620
They come from the same era, and yet they're wildly more successful.

03:47.620 --> 03:52.420
Not because they're anti-SJW, but because they ignore SJWs entirely.

03:52.420 --> 03:56.460
And there does seem to be a serious correlation between people that aren't SJWs, and the

03:56.460 --> 03:58.860
amount and quality of work they produce.

03:58.860 --> 04:00.260
This is pretty obvious to me.

04:00.260 --> 04:03.900
Liberals talk about rights, while Conservatives talk about responsibilities, and the proper

04:03.900 --> 04:05.880
balance of those two forces is in the middle.

04:05.880 --> 04:10.220
If things are too right-leaning, then it's all responsibility and no rights, a fascist

04:10.220 --> 04:11.220
right.

04:11.220 --> 04:14.220
If things are too left-leaning, then it's all rights and no responsibility.

04:14.220 --> 04:18.860
And society naturally breaks down, because there are more people owed more things through

04:18.860 --> 04:22.700
the virtue of their rights, than there are people responsible to go out into the world

04:22.700 --> 04:25.240
and actually procure those things that are owed.

04:25.240 --> 04:29.580
So it's no surprise to me that SJW YouTubers lack the work ethic to maintain a successful

04:29.580 --> 04:33.180
career over not just years, but potentially decades.

04:33.180 --> 04:35.420
Too many rights, and not enough responsibility.

04:35.420 --> 04:40.080
And it also makes perfect sense that SJWs would hate people more successful than them.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.760
Because successful people get to enjoy the fruits of their labour.

04:42.760 --> 04:46.560
Fruits that SJWs believe they're owed through the rights they claim to have.

04:46.560 --> 04:51.080
In my video on Why Capitalism is Successful, I stated my belief that upper-middle-class

04:51.080 --> 04:55.300
Socialists and Communists who claim to want to help the poor, don't actually want to

04:55.300 --> 04:58.300
help the poor, but simply hate those who are richer than them.

04:58.300 --> 05:02.220
They clothe their desire to steal from those more successful than they are, in a layer

05:02.220 --> 05:07.400
of false humanitarianism for the working class, confirmed to be false because of how little

05:07.400 --> 05:11.700
resources actually get into the hands of the working class once any socialist government

05:11.700 --> 05:12.700
takes power.

05:12.700 --> 05:14.040
This is just conjecture on my part.

05:14.040 --> 05:17.720
But I think this is related to the Chinese idea of three generations.

05:17.720 --> 05:21.320
Where the grandfather is working class, but understands that he must work hard to build

05:21.320 --> 05:22.540
a better life for his family.

05:22.540 --> 05:26.860
The father is middle class, who watched the grandfather work himself to death, and wants

05:26.860 --> 05:28.660
his son to avoid that fate.

05:28.660 --> 05:32.520
And the son is upper class, has never suffered a day in his life, doesn't understand the

05:32.520 --> 05:35.080
bubble of privilege his family has constructed for him.

05:35.080 --> 05:38.500
And his lack of ability to contend with the harshness of the world leads to the ruin of

05:38.500 --> 05:42.480
his family, and the return to the grandfather stage in the next generation.

05:42.480 --> 05:46.820
In English, this idea is expressed through the similar saying of, hard times create tough

05:46.820 --> 05:51.740
people, tough people create easy times, easy times create soft people, soft people create

05:51.740 --> 05:52.880
hard times.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.800
Things really do seem to work in a cyclical manner like that.

05:55.800 --> 05:59.580
And whenever I see a social justice warrior wearing thousands of dollars of clothing,

05:59.580 --> 06:03.980
stuff that a working class member would never be able to afford, holding a sign saying eat

06:03.980 --> 06:07.580
the rich, what I see is a soft person creating hard times.

06:07.580 --> 06:11.660
I see the son, standing on the precipice of the ruination of his family.

06:11.660 --> 06:15.700
And for these rich kids, the dreaded 1% they're railing against is almost always going to

06:15.700 --> 06:17.580
contain members of their family.

06:17.580 --> 06:23.140
And from my point of view, it seems like these people are so entitled, so ridiculously, monstrously

06:23.140 --> 06:27.220
egotistical, that they're dragging their family conflicts out into the political sphere.

06:27.220 --> 06:32.180
Agitating for the radical restructuring and ultimate downfall of western civilization,

06:32.180 --> 06:34.480
because they can't get along with their fucking dads.

06:34.480 --> 06:39.740
This view has been making itself known recently with an extreme hatred of people with $1 billion,

06:39.740 --> 06:41.840
regardless of any other attributes of the person.

06:41.840 --> 06:45.220
They could be any race or gender, they could be hard working to the point that they legitimately

06:45.220 --> 06:47.020
earned that billion, doesn't matter.

06:47.020 --> 06:50.620
If they've got 10 digits in the old bank account, they deserve to be hated.

06:50.620 --> 06:54.300
Anyone who has a billion dollars either exploited a monopoly that should have been broken up,

06:54.300 --> 06:58.300
got inside information available to other investors, bribed some politicians, or inherited

06:58.300 --> 07:00.680
the money from their parents who did one of the above.

07:00.680 --> 07:04.800
These people don't understand how fucking hard CEOs actually work.

07:04.800 --> 07:09.440
A college kid's perception of a CEO is a fat cat sitting in an office smoking a cigar,

07:09.440 --> 07:10.520
watching the money roll in.

07:10.520 --> 07:12.720
But that's not a person, that's the monopoly man.

07:12.720 --> 07:17.880
A CEO is a CEO because they've worked for 80 hours a week for 50 years with no breaks.

07:17.880 --> 07:23.440
A CEO is a CEO because they get up and work at 3am when their overseas client calls them

07:23.440 --> 07:27.880
at demanding a fix to a problem that's about to cost the company $100 million, and if the

07:27.880 --> 07:32.680
CEO doesn't fix it right now, there are many younger, hungrier competitors that are willing

07:32.680 --> 07:36.320
to snap that contract up and make a fortune for themselves.

07:36.320 --> 07:41.840
CEOs are CEOs because they consist of largely hyper-productive people who are incapable

07:41.840 --> 07:46.620
of taking breaks, and they are an extreme minority of cases in the human condition.

07:46.620 --> 07:49.500
Most women and most men are not these people.

07:49.500 --> 07:53.340
These people are the 1%, not just in terms of their assets, but in terms of how fucking

07:53.340 --> 07:54.340
rare they are.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.480
Why should anyone have a billion dollars?

07:56.480 --> 08:00.560
Why should anyone be proud to brandish their billions when there is so much suffering in

08:00.560 --> 08:01.560
the world?

08:01.560 --> 08:05.680
Because the billionaire likely earned it by working harder than every single employee

08:05.680 --> 08:08.360
at the New York Times by a factor of 10.

08:08.360 --> 08:11.940
And if you're going to remove the extreme rewards from extreme work, then who's going

08:11.940 --> 08:12.940
to do the work?

08:12.940 --> 08:14.840
That's what happens in a socialist country.

08:14.840 --> 08:19.760
The productive class gets wiped out because there's no longer any reason to be productive,

08:19.760 --> 08:21.200
and the economy grinds to a halt.

08:21.200 --> 08:26.160
I know this will sound terrible to SJWs, but it makes sense that old rich people are old

08:26.160 --> 08:27.160
and rich.

08:27.160 --> 08:31.440
If you have any sense, money is something you'll attempt to accumulate across your life.

08:31.440 --> 08:34.960
You trade in your youthful potential for your wealthy old age, but you're still going to

08:34.960 --> 08:35.960
be old.

08:35.960 --> 08:39.800
Would you willingly make that trade with the snap of your fingers and miss out on 50 years

08:39.800 --> 08:40.800
of your life?

08:40.800 --> 08:44.520
The only reason you're not rich yet is because you haven't put in enough hours on this planet

08:44.520 --> 08:47.180
to be rich, you spoiled brats.

08:47.180 --> 08:52.680
This analysis works not just on sub-accounts or dollars in the bank, but in sports, in

08:52.680 --> 08:58.160
video games, in grades at school, in any domain in which there is a relatively objective measurement

08:58.160 --> 08:59.160
of success.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.360
I'd say there's two hard and fast rules.

09:01.360 --> 09:05.280
One, if there's an objective measurement of success, the majority of successes will

09:05.280 --> 09:09.180
be clustered around a small minority of people at the top of the hierarchy, as predicted

09:09.180 --> 09:10.600
by the Pareto Principle.

09:10.600 --> 09:15.280
Two, social justice warriors will object to this distribution of success as being a product

09:15.280 --> 09:20.160
of privilege and oppression, when in reality it's a product of talent, intelligence, and

09:20.160 --> 09:22.960
disproportionate amount of time invested in the pursuit.

09:22.960 --> 09:25.920
And I think on some level the progressives must know this.

09:25.920 --> 09:30.200
If our society truly was nothing but a power struggle, with no hierarchies of competence

09:30.200 --> 09:33.980
involved whatsoever, why is the power on every time you come home?

09:33.980 --> 09:38.440
Why do supply lines keep the food moving from farm to warehouse to grocery store?

09:38.440 --> 09:42.220
Even if there is some corruption, and I'm sure there is, at some point there has to

09:42.220 --> 09:45.860
be competent people doing real work somewhere in the chain.

09:45.860 --> 09:47.440
Things do not run themselves.

09:47.440 --> 09:52.200
In fact, things break themselves down ridiculously quickly without competent intervention.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.200
What's the statistic?

09:53.200 --> 09:57.360
A helicopter needs eight hours of work for one hour of flight, something like that?

09:57.360 --> 10:01.680
Do you really think a society comprised of nothing but power grabs could even keep them

10:01.680 --> 10:02.680
in the air?

10:02.680 --> 10:06.920
It would seem to me that the tendency of both the social justice warrior and the communist

10:06.920 --> 10:11.440
to hate the successful stems from a hatred of themselves and their own inadequacies.

10:11.440 --> 10:15.800
Or maybe it stems from a complete and total ignorance about the inner machinations of

10:15.800 --> 10:19.320
society, something that their rich parents have shielded them from the whole time.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.920
Or maybe it stems from something else.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.880
I started this video talking about failed YouTubers.

10:24.880 --> 10:28.080
Because hating the successful is not something limited to billionaires.

10:28.080 --> 10:32.280
The mainstream media hates PewDiePie because he's a guy who makes silly voices and plays

10:32.280 --> 10:36.760
video games, and he has a larger audience than almost every old media outlet on the

10:36.760 --> 10:37.760
planet.

10:37.760 --> 10:42.600
AVGN and JonTron got flack because they refused to conform to the proper political positions.

10:42.600 --> 10:47.120
These are people that are not only just successful, but are also out of the control of social

10:47.120 --> 10:48.120
justice.

10:48.120 --> 10:52.840
You'll notice that social justice individuals that are also successful get a lot less flack,

10:52.840 --> 10:53.840
right?

10:53.840 --> 10:57.080
Maybe that's because it's never been about hating the successful at all.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.600
Maybe it's because it's been about hating the unbowed.
