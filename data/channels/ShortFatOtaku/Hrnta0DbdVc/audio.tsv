0	3640	Recently, I decided to go back and see what Yahtzee's been doing.
3640	5400	You know, the Zero Punctuation guy.
5400	10080	The only reason The Escapist became a relevant platform due to their signing him on exclusively.
10080	14200	I remember watching ZP religiously for the first couple of years, but I eventually just
14200	15200	fell out of it.
15200	18800	I didn't really turn on him or anything, I never stopped liking his stuff, I just one
18800	21640	day forgot to go check out the new update, and that was that.
21640	25920	But considering how absolutely cucked the game's media is right now, and The Escapist
25920	30760	specifically, with the whole bringing back movie bob thing, and the apologizing to Zoe
30760	34920	Quinn for actually talking about ethics in journalism thing, I predicted that Yahtzee
34920	38200	would have cucked out like the rest of them, that the establishment would have worn his
38200	42520	fine edge into a dull, pathetic, blunted caricature of what he once was.
42520	44220	Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised.
44220	47560	He still had all of the acid and wit that I remembered from the early days.
47560	51460	He even made a joke at the expense of the Ghostbusters reboot and Hollywood's recent
51460	54840	trend of blaming fans when their shitty movies failed to make any money.
54840	58680	I was actually a little overjoyed, and I spent the rest of the afternoon binge watching
58680	62400	ZP while eating chocolate covered almonds and beef jerky.
62400	67640	It seems like as my viewing habits regressed to an earlier state, so did my eating habits.
67640	70240	Back to a time when I was much, much fatter.
70240	74360	Anyway, the reason I was pleasantly surprised is because most of the internet personalities
74360	80020	from around 2009 have either vanished into obscurity or mutated into social justice infected
80020	84400	variations of their former selves, still living off the viral videos from their glory
84400	85400	days.
85400	88980	Not totally understanding that the reason they're now struggling to keep up is because
88980	93020	everything that made them great back then is exactly what they've sacrificed at the
93020	94180	altar of social justice.
94180	96020	Here's a great example of what I mean.
96020	97260	From Linkara's Twitter.
97260	101420	Okay guys, I know I gave a positive review of the Tomb Raider comic, but it's actually
101420	104500	kind of rude to at creators with reviews of their work.
104500	107940	It doesn't help that since my show is intended to focus on the negative stuff, description
107940	109780	of the video might give them the wrong idea.
109780	114820	I never thought I'd see the day where the angry reviewers of yesteryear cucked out so
114820	119900	fucking hard that they blatantly admit that by their own warped definitions, their own
119900	123200	show, their own body of work is toxic and hateful.
123200	127780	Angry reviewers review bad stuff, they're angry for a reason, it's a part of the gag.
127780	132380	If that's now problematic in the current year, why are you still doing your show Linkara?
132380	134580	And then there's the obvious example, Spoonie.
134580	138700	Six months since a gaming stream from him, two years since a vlog, and what is it, three
138740	140060	years since a review?
140060	144640	But oh boy, he can certainly spend 18 hours a day tweeting about Trump, that's for sure.
144640	148860	In between whining about having no money and all of his various diseases of course.
148860	151700	I honestly don't know how April hasn't dumped him by now.
151700	156140	Maybe it's because she's an SJW herself, and Spoonie has morphed into the perfect soft
156140	157620	boy for her tastes.
157620	161280	This one's actually really sad for me guys, I made a vlog a couple years ago where I describe
161280	165940	how Spoonie was the inspiration for us to start our channel and stuff, and I once considered
165940	169340	him the absolute best YouTuber out there.
169340	174780	The personalities that have blown up in the past 5 years haven't been explicitly anti-SJW,
174780	178340	although those people have had their fair share of successes too, but it's been those
178340	180380	that are largely apolitical.
180380	184320	They have a slight shitlord-y bent, sure, but I honestly think that's just the natural
184320	187980	state of the average person, to recoil at the sight of social justice.
187980	192420	But they, for the most part, keep their shows out of the political sphere, only bringing
192420	194060	it in when it's relevant.
194060	199140	AVGN's channel is still going strong after like 13 years of operation, because regardless
199140	201620	of politics he sticks to what he knows.
201620	205220	Nerd videos are largely apolitical, sure, but when it came time to speak out about the
205220	209460	2016 Ghostbusters reboot, he did so as fairly as he could.
209460	213740	It didn't stop the SJWs from throwing temper tantrums over it, sure, but he wasn't hyperbolic
213740	214740	on the topic.
214740	218740	Aside from JonTron's dumpster fire debate with Destiny, he's stuck to what he knows
218740	220980	too, and his videos have never been better.
220980	223980	These guys are cut from the same cloth as Spoonie and Linkara.
223980	227620	They come from the same era, and yet they're wildly more successful.
227620	232420	Not because they're anti-SJW, but because they ignore SJWs entirely.
232420	236460	And there does seem to be a serious correlation between people that aren't SJWs, and the
236460	238860	amount and quality of work they produce.
238860	240260	This is pretty obvious to me.
240260	243900	Liberals talk about rights, while Conservatives talk about responsibilities, and the proper
243900	245880	balance of those two forces is in the middle.
245880	250220	If things are too right-leaning, then it's all responsibility and no rights, a fascist
250220	251220	right.
251220	254220	If things are too left-leaning, then it's all rights and no responsibility.
254220	258860	And society naturally breaks down, because there are more people owed more things through
258860	262700	the virtue of their rights, than there are people responsible to go out into the world
262700	265240	and actually procure those things that are owed.
265240	269580	So it's no surprise to me that SJW YouTubers lack the work ethic to maintain a successful
269580	273180	career over not just years, but potentially decades.
273180	275420	Too many rights, and not enough responsibility.
275420	280080	And it also makes perfect sense that SJWs would hate people more successful than them.
280080	282760	Because successful people get to enjoy the fruits of their labour.
282760	286560	Fruits that SJWs believe they're owed through the rights they claim to have.
286560	291080	In my video on Why Capitalism is Successful, I stated my belief that upper-middle-class
291080	295300	Socialists and Communists who claim to want to help the poor, don't actually want to
295300	298300	help the poor, but simply hate those who are richer than them.
298300	302220	They clothe their desire to steal from those more successful than they are, in a layer
302220	307400	of false humanitarianism for the working class, confirmed to be false because of how little
307400	311700	resources actually get into the hands of the working class once any socialist government
311700	312700	takes power.
312700	314040	This is just conjecture on my part.
314040	317720	But I think this is related to the Chinese idea of three generations.
317720	321320	Where the grandfather is working class, but understands that he must work hard to build
321320	322540	a better life for his family.
322540	326860	The father is middle class, who watched the grandfather work himself to death, and wants
326860	328660	his son to avoid that fate.
328660	332520	And the son is upper class, has never suffered a day in his life, doesn't understand the
332520	335080	bubble of privilege his family has constructed for him.
335080	338500	And his lack of ability to contend with the harshness of the world leads to the ruin of
338500	342480	his family, and the return to the grandfather stage in the next generation.
342480	346820	In English, this idea is expressed through the similar saying of, hard times create tough
346820	351740	people, tough people create easy times, easy times create soft people, soft people create
351740	352880	hard times.
352880	355800	Things really do seem to work in a cyclical manner like that.
355800	359580	And whenever I see a social justice warrior wearing thousands of dollars of clothing,
359580	363980	stuff that a working class member would never be able to afford, holding a sign saying eat
363980	367580	the rich, what I see is a soft person creating hard times.
367580	371660	I see the son, standing on the precipice of the ruination of his family.
371660	375700	And for these rich kids, the dreaded 1% they're railing against is almost always going to
375700	377580	contain members of their family.
377580	383140	And from my point of view, it seems like these people are so entitled, so ridiculously, monstrously
383140	387220	egotistical, that they're dragging their family conflicts out into the political sphere.
387220	392180	Agitating for the radical restructuring and ultimate downfall of western civilization,
392180	394480	because they can't get along with their fucking dads.
394480	399740	This view has been making itself known recently with an extreme hatred of people with $1 billion,
399740	401840	regardless of any other attributes of the person.
401840	405220	They could be any race or gender, they could be hard working to the point that they legitimately
405220	407020	earned that billion, doesn't matter.
407020	410620	If they've got 10 digits in the old bank account, they deserve to be hated.
410620	414300	Anyone who has a billion dollars either exploited a monopoly that should have been broken up,
414300	418300	got inside information available to other investors, bribed some politicians, or inherited
418300	420680	the money from their parents who did one of the above.
420680	424800	These people don't understand how fucking hard CEOs actually work.
424800	429440	A college kid's perception of a CEO is a fat cat sitting in an office smoking a cigar,
429440	430520	watching the money roll in.
430520	432720	But that's not a person, that's the monopoly man.
432720	437880	A CEO is a CEO because they've worked for 80 hours a week for 50 years with no breaks.
437880	443440	A CEO is a CEO because they get up and work at 3am when their overseas client calls them
443440	447880	at demanding a fix to a problem that's about to cost the company $100 million, and if the
447880	452680	CEO doesn't fix it right now, there are many younger, hungrier competitors that are willing
452680	456320	to snap that contract up and make a fortune for themselves.
456320	461840	CEOs are CEOs because they consist of largely hyper-productive people who are incapable
461840	466620	of taking breaks, and they are an extreme minority of cases in the human condition.
466620	469500	Most women and most men are not these people.
469500	473340	These people are the 1%, not just in terms of their assets, but in terms of how fucking
473340	474340	rare they are.
474340	476480	Why should anyone have a billion dollars?
476480	480560	Why should anyone be proud to brandish their billions when there is so much suffering in
480560	481560	the world?
481560	485680	Because the billionaire likely earned it by working harder than every single employee
485680	488360	at the New York Times by a factor of 10.
488360	491940	And if you're going to remove the extreme rewards from extreme work, then who's going
491940	492940	to do the work?
492940	494840	That's what happens in a socialist country.
494840	499760	The productive class gets wiped out because there's no longer any reason to be productive,
499760	501200	and the economy grinds to a halt.
501200	506160	I know this will sound terrible to SJWs, but it makes sense that old rich people are old
506160	507160	and rich.
507160	511440	If you have any sense, money is something you'll attempt to accumulate across your life.
511440	514960	You trade in your youthful potential for your wealthy old age, but you're still going to
514960	515960	be old.
515960	519800	Would you willingly make that trade with the snap of your fingers and miss out on 50 years
519800	520800	of your life?
520800	524520	The only reason you're not rich yet is because you haven't put in enough hours on this planet
524520	527180	to be rich, you spoiled brats.
527180	532680	This analysis works not just on sub-accounts or dollars in the bank, but in sports, in
532680	538160	video games, in grades at school, in any domain in which there is a relatively objective measurement
538160	539160	of success.
539160	541360	I'd say there's two hard and fast rules.
541360	545280	One, if there's an objective measurement of success, the majority of successes will
545280	549180	be clustered around a small minority of people at the top of the hierarchy, as predicted
549180	550600	by the Pareto Principle.
550600	555280	Two, social justice warriors will object to this distribution of success as being a product
555280	560160	of privilege and oppression, when in reality it's a product of talent, intelligence, and
560160	562960	disproportionate amount of time invested in the pursuit.
562960	565920	And I think on some level the progressives must know this.
565920	570200	If our society truly was nothing but a power struggle, with no hierarchies of competence
570200	573980	involved whatsoever, why is the power on every time you come home?
573980	578440	Why do supply lines keep the food moving from farm to warehouse to grocery store?
578440	582220	Even if there is some corruption, and I'm sure there is, at some point there has to
582220	585860	be competent people doing real work somewhere in the chain.
585860	587440	Things do not run themselves.
587440	592200	In fact, things break themselves down ridiculously quickly without competent intervention.
592200	593200	What's the statistic?
593200	597360	A helicopter needs eight hours of work for one hour of flight, something like that?
597360	601680	Do you really think a society comprised of nothing but power grabs could even keep them
601680	602680	in the air?
602680	606920	It would seem to me that the tendency of both the social justice warrior and the communist
606920	611440	to hate the successful stems from a hatred of themselves and their own inadequacies.
611440	615800	Or maybe it stems from a complete and total ignorance about the inner machinations of
615800	619320	society, something that their rich parents have shielded them from the whole time.
619320	621920	Or maybe it stems from something else.
621920	624880	I started this video talking about failed YouTubers.
624880	628080	Because hating the successful is not something limited to billionaires.
628080	632280	The mainstream media hates PewDiePie because he's a guy who makes silly voices and plays
632280	636760	video games, and he has a larger audience than almost every old media outlet on the
636760	637760	planet.
637760	642600	AVGN and JonTron got flack because they refused to conform to the proper political positions.
642600	647120	These are people that are not only just successful, but are also out of the control of social
647120	648120	justice.
648120	652840	You'll notice that social justice individuals that are also successful get a lot less flack,
652840	653840	right?
653840	657080	Maybe that's because it's never been about hating the successful at all.
657080	659600	Maybe it's because it's been about hating the unbowed.
