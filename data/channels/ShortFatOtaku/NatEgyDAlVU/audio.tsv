0	4200	I had intended for my video on the Release the Memo hashtag to be a one and done sort
4200	6720	of thing, at least until the memo actually dropped.
6720	10600	But there have since been multiple developments, to the point that I think the situation warrants
10600	11600	a second look.
11600	15220	The mainstream media's eventual response to Release the Memo, after they'd realized
15220	19360	that simply ignoring it and scrubbing it off Twitter's trending page was not nearly enough,
19360	23520	was to call everybody interested in the memo's release a bunch of Russian bot accounts and
23520	24880	not actual people.
24880	28800	And despite this assertion, that no actual human is interested in the contents of the
29800	34240	Nancy Pelosi said on a live interview with the Democratic Party's propaganda arm, otherwise
34240	37640	known as CNN, that the entire story is fake anyway.
58800	60040	We can't trust you guys.
60040	61040	Let us read it.
61040	62040	Let us figure it out.
62040	63040	You can redact the names.
63040	65840	You can make it safe enough for us to look at it because they say the same thing about
65840	66840	you.
66840	69040	That the Russia investigation, there's no collusion.
69040	72360	You guys are pushing the ball to political advantage to stymie the president.
72360	77080	And they talk about this memo like it should have been in the Raiders of the Lost Ark.
77080	81360	This thing that this is the holy grail of the truth about what was happening during
81360	82360	the campaign.
82360	84600	And it points the finger at the Democrats and the FBI.
84600	86800	Well, let me just say this.
86800	91520	We're not going to become them, the Republicans, because they are totally irresponsible in
91520	92520	this regard.
92520	94760	We're talking about the intelligence community.
94760	98700	We're not talking about some issue that we're having a fight about.
98700	101300	We're talking about our national security.
101300	105000	As I said, when I've been on that committee, I had been on that committee a long time and
105000	108480	serve as leader and involved in those issues.
108480	111460	This is not to be politicized.
111460	113180	This is about fact.
113180	115180	It's about evidence, about data.
115180	120960	It's not about making up a false memo based on a false premise that the chairman hasn't
120960	122420	even read.
122420	123420	And then to put it out there.
123420	124420	So it's not about...
124420	126180	I give you that he hasn't, if he hasn't read it, that's a problem.
126180	128180	We'll take, we'll take that out with this.
128180	132180	How can you decide if you haven't read it, that it should be revealed to the American
132180	133180	people?
133180	134180	Fair point.
134180	138140	But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.
138140	139360	What I'm saying is this.
139360	142940	Are you saying without revealing anything that's confidential, classified, obviously.
142940	143940	I can't do that.
143940	144940	I get it.
145700	148960	Are you saying that if the American people see this memo and they read it and they think
148960	153240	about it, that they could not reasonably conclude that there was any problem with what happened
153240	154320	during the election?
154320	155320	Of course not.
155320	157640	Well then why are they so anxious to release it?
157640	159720	Because it's not even true.
159720	160720	It's not even true.
160720	163820	They have made up a memo that isn't even true.
163820	166760	If it's all fake, Nancy, why the obstruction?
166760	170680	And more importantly, if it's all fake, why do you claim that revealing it will reveal
170680	172000	classified information?
172000	175000	If the classified information is fake too, who cares?
175000	178660	Either the memo's contents are fake and then it doesn't matter or the memo's contents
178660	180860	are real and therefore sensitive.
180860	182420	You can't have it both ways.
182420	186160	In fact, I think we should be telling a lot of people that phrase, you can't have it
186160	187160	both ways.
187160	191700	Hey New York Times, you've written a handful of articles that discuss, both directly and
191700	196000	indirectly, how dangerous it would be to America's national security if its intelligence sources
196000	198140	were compromised by releasing the Nunes memo.
198140	202500	At the same time though, do you remember when you published the name of a covert CIA official
202500	204500	back in July of 2017?
204500	205820	You can't have it both ways.
205820	209860	Hey Representative Adam Schiff, you wrote your own memo too, on the same subject as
209860	210860	Nunes?
210860	211860	Well that's great.
211860	215140	How about we release both memos and let the public decide which one is the more accurate
215140	216140	version of the truth?
216140	219800	Wait, you only want yours released and not the Nunes memo?
219800	221140	You can't have it both ways.
221140	225180	Hey Diane Feinstein, remember when your party heavily pushed the narrative that released
225180	227900	the memo was made up of Russian bots and influencers?
227900	231540	Remember when you and Schiff got together to ask Twitter and Facebook to look into the
231540	232540	matter?
232540	233900	What was the response that you got from them?
233900	238820	Oh yeah, Twitter and Facebook basically admitted that the hashtag genuinely went viral.
238820	242700	Well do you guys remember that second letter you sent, demanding that Twitter and Facebook
242700	245980	dig up results that were politically convenient for your point of view?
245980	247180	Well which is it guys?
247180	249700	Do you want the truth or do you want Russian collusion?
249700	251300	You can't have it both ways.
251300	254860	And considering that the Democrats were the party of advocating for peace with the Russians
254860	259020	right up until Trump's election, I find your sudden concern really, really hard to
259020	260020	believe.
260020	263100	However, the Democrats do actually have one possible good point.
263100	267320	This whole release the memo thing might be one giant nothingburger, constructed by the
267320	270380	Republicans in order to distract from the government shutdown, and that's actually
270380	271660	a plausible explanation.
271660	274780	But we're only going to know that if and when the memo is released.
274780	277900	If this version of events is true, it would actually benefit the Democrats if the memo
277900	279000	were made public.
279000	282540	But considering the democratic resistance to the memo's release, I think this theory
282540	284020	is probably full of hot air.
284020	286340	Nonetheless, the government shutdown can't be ignored.
286340	292180	The shutdown began at midnight EST on Saturday, January 20th, 2018, and ended two days later
292180	294020	on Monday, January 22nd.
294020	297900	The shutdown began after a failure to pass legislation to fund government operations
297900	298900	and agencies.
298900	302980	This stemmed from disputes over the extension of status of persons affected by the Deferred
302980	307860	Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration policy, otherwise known as DACA, and therefore
307860	310740	whether those covered under the program should face deportation.
310740	314660	There was also a dispute over whether funding should be allocated towards building a Mexico-United
314660	318700	States border wall, a keystone policy during Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
318700	320340	Well shit, that sounds like a big deal.
320340	323980	I know that in parliamentary systems, failure to pass a budget automatically triggers a
323980	327260	dissolution of parliament and election for all the seats therein.
327260	329440	Maybe you Americans should adopt something similar.
329440	333400	The prospect of every congressman losing their jobs might make government shutdowns a last
333400	336380	resort instead of simply another political pressure point.
336380	340140	In any case, what's this DACA immigration policy that's got everybody up in arms?
340180	343620	Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals was an American immigration policy that allowed
343620	347720	some individuals who entered the country as minors and had either entered or remained
347720	352740	in the country illegally to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation
352740	354580	and to be eligible for a work permit.
354580	359760	As of 2017, approximately 800,000 individuals were enrolled in the program created by DACA.
359760	364500	The policy was established by the Obama administration in June 2012 and was rescinded by the Trump
364500	366700	administration in September 2017.
366700	369940	The policy was established by executive action rather than legislation.
369940	374700	However, participating individuals were sometimes referred to as DREAMers after the DREAM Act,
374700	379800	a bipartisan bill first proposed in 2001 that was the first of a number of subsequent bills
379800	383500	in the U.S. House and Senate attempting to provide a pathway to citizenship or other
383500	388040	legal status for certain undocumented residents who immigrated illegally as children and
388040	390820	subsequently completed some college or military service.
390820	392420	So let me see if I have this straight.
392420	394860	Illegal immigrants bring their kids to the United States with them.
394860	399060	None of them are legal immigrants but the kids, being kids, are not at fault.
399060	400060	Their parents are.
400060	404500	Because the kids aren't at fault themselves, DACA proponents wanted to give them a free pass.
404500	407700	After all, they only broke immigration law because their parents forced them to.
407700	412140	Some of these kids have grown up in the USA and are entirely culturally American, if not
412140	414340	legally, with no connection to their home country.
414340	417920	And like I said before, these kids are called DREAMers after the DREAM Act.
417920	419660	But what is that DREAM Act?
419660	424860	The DREAM Act, acronym for Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, is an
424860	429820	American legislative proposal for a multi-phase process for qualifying alien minors in the
429820	434420	United States that would first grant conditional residency and, upon meeting further qualifications,
434420	435460	permanent residency.
435460	440000	The bill was first introduced in the Senate on August 1st, 2001, and has since been reintroduced
440000	441940	several times but has failed to pass.
441940	445580	Oh, so they're called DREAMers based on an act that failed to pass into law.
445580	450340	It's not like this path to citizenship was once legalized and then later revoked, unfairly
450340	453280	pulling the rug out from people who had already started working down the path.
453280	454760	It was never legal at all.
454760	457800	And why is there such a commotion about DREAMers in the first place?
457800	462360	Well, it turns out there's actually a decent argument for allowing DREAMers to stay.
462360	465160	DREAMers have no connection to the country they're actually citizens of.
465160	468200	They generally can't speak the language or participate in the culture.
468200	472360	They're fully Americanized and have participated in American life for as long as they can remember.
472360	475800	They didn't mean to illegally immigrate, their parents forced them to do it.
475800	480320	Surely, if any illegal immigrants deserved a fast track to citizenship, it would be these
480320	481320	people, right?
481320	482320	Maybe so.
482320	485240	With the point of view of the DREAMers, it seems like the only right thing to do.
485240	487360	But let's look at it from the point of view of the government.
487360	491640	The US government has a real, tangible interest in preventing illegal immigration as well
491640	496720	as a real, tangible interest in prioritizing legal immigration as the preferred, and only,
496720	498920	way for non-citizens to become citizens.
498920	503280	I don't think anybody would seriously dispute this premise, with the exception of the most
503280	506360	radical anarcho-communists and Moviebob.
506360	508660	And neither of them are worth serious consideration.
508660	512460	So if the US government were to grant blanket amnesty to all DREAMers because they were
512460	516660	children at the time of their illegal immigration and therefore not to blame, and are, in every
516660	521980	other way, adult Americans, that would still require the deportation or incarceration of
521980	526260	the parents of DREAMers, because those people are responsible, they weren't children when
526260	529220	they crossed the border, and they did knowingly break the law.
529220	532880	The parents of DREAMers are just straight up illegal immigrants, they're not DREAMers
532880	533880	themselves.
533880	537700	There's no hazy middle ground here, they failed to work through the legal immigration
537700	542180	proceedings, or the legal refugee proceedings, or the legal proceedings for work or school
542180	543180	permits.
543180	544820	They simply broke immigration law.
544820	548220	Secondly, in bringing their children with them, the children that would later grow up
548220	552020	to be the DREAMers, they broke child trafficking laws as well.
552020	556340	Even if the DREAMers get the free pass they want, their parents are still criminals and
556340	558220	need to answer for their crimes.
558220	561860	Thirdly, illegal immigration is not a victimless crime.
561860	565760	Even if we discount the drug or gang related violence that some illegal immigrants bring
565760	570200	with them, even peaceful illegal immigrants have a negative effect on the job market.
570200	574440	When a nation takes in an influx of cheap labour, the working class's wages are driven
574440	578200	down, as companies can afford to hire people who will do the same job for the cheapest
578200	579200	wage.
579200	582840	When the pool of workers is smaller, wages inflate, as companies compete to attract what
582840	585040	they need from a smaller available selection.
585040	586680	It's all about supply and demand.
586680	588280	Oh, you don't believe me?
588280	590540	Well how about we read this paper on the subject?
590540	594920	Illegal immigration, the impact on wages and employment of black workers.
594920	598100	The willingness of policy makers to tolerate the presence of illegal immigrants in the
598100	602560	nation's labour force exposes a seemly side of the nation's collective consciousness.
602560	606760	Illegal immigrants, who themselves are often exploited even though they may not think so,
606760	610760	are allowed to cause harm in the form of unemployment and depressed wages to the most vulnerable
610760	612500	workers in the American workforce.
612500	616040	The continued reluctance by our national government to get illegal immigrants out of the labour
616040	620600	force, and to keep them out, by enforcing the existing sanctions at the worksite against
620600	624600	employers of illegal immigrants, is itself a massive violation of the civil rights of
624600	629320	all low skilled workers in the United States, and of low skilled black workers in particular.
629320	631960	Illegal immigrants have no right to work in the United States.
631960	634420	In fact, they have no right to even be in the country.
634420	637880	Enforcing our nation's labour laws, including the protection of the legal labour force from
637880	641780	the presence of illegal immigrant workers, is the civil rights issue of this generation
641780	643100	of American workers.
643100	646500	It is time, therefore, to make our immigration laws credible.
646500	650280	The way to do this is to adhere to the findings of the US Commission on Immigration Reform,
650280	654520	chaired by the late Barbara Jordan, who boldly stated what should be the goal of public policy.
654520	658640	The credibility of immigration policy can be measured by a simple yardstick.
658640	663080	People who should get in do get in, people who should not get in are kept out, and people
663080	665620	who are judged a portable are required to leave.
665620	669840	No one would benefit more by the adherence to that standard than would low skilled black
669840	671680	American workers and their families.
671680	676560	I don't know guys, it's almost like the best way to harm the 1% in America and help
676560	680120	poor black workers in the process is to remove illegal labour from the picture.
680120	684360	It's almost like all the white middle class democrats who demand programs like DACA want
684360	688220	to offer up token efforts in the face of their own white guilt, all the while not caring
688220	691440	what actually happens to their fellow black citizens, who they don't have to interact
691440	692840	with or answer to.
692840	697260	But most importantly of all, it would send future illegal immigrants a message.
697260	699220	Send your babies to the USA.
699220	703880	Even if you get caught, your child will be forgiven and granted a frontline pass to citizenship,
703880	707720	bypassing all those other plebs who are working through the legal process, as long as you
707720	712320	manage to raise them for long enough in the USA that they become sufficiently American.
712320	716660	Granting Dreamers blanket amnesty would only incentivize future illegal immigrants to bypass
716660	720280	legal immigration structures, if they thought that breaking the law would be good for their
720280	721280	children.
721280	724640	And if this sounds like just conjecture, I'd like to remind you that this has happened
724640	725640	before.
725640	729360	In 1986, the Immigration Reform and Control Act was passed.
729360	733120	Part of the act provided an easy path to citizenship for illegal immigrants that had arrived in
733120	734940	the United States before 1982.
734940	737040	This was agreed to as a compromise.
737040	740680	America's illegal immigrant population could no longer be ignored, and the solution was
740680	744880	to provide an easy path to citizenship for those already in the USA in exchange for stricter
744880	747960	enforcement of the law towards future illegal immigrants.
747960	752100	Critics of this compromise believe that the IRCA's implementation would embolden future
752100	755440	illegal immigrants in their attempts to hop the border, because it would be taken as proof
755440	760120	that the USA, if pushed enough, would rather grant amnesty to illegal immigrants rather
760120	761200	than deport them.
761200	765320	And judging by the massively inflated population of Dreamers we're now dealing with thirty
765320	767920	years later, I'd say that this criticism was probably correct.
767920	770680	But let's rewind this whole thing back to the government shutdown.
770680	774680	Trump rescinds the DACA policy, which allowed Dreamers, the undocumented children of illegal
774680	776840	immigrants, to stay in the USA indefinitely.
776840	780920	And the Democratic Party decided that their best response to this was to filibuster the
780920	783840	federal budget bill in the Senate, shutting the government down.
783840	784960	Let me repeat that.
784960	790040	Because people in the USA illegally lost their ability to remain in the USA illegally, because
790040	793840	the US government exercised the sovereign right of any nation on earth, the right to
793840	797440	determine which foreigners have the privilege of entering or staying within the country,
797440	799080	the Democrats shut down the government.
799080	800080	One more time.
800080	803560	The Democrats shut down the government because illegal immigrants were going to start getting
803560	804560	deported again.
804560	806660	I don't even know where to start on this, you guys.
806660	809860	I remember when the Democratic Party advocated for reasonable things.
809860	811240	Gay marriage, for example.
811240	814240	It was obvious to anybody with a brain that Republicans were on the wrong side of the
814240	815280	gay marriage issue.
815280	819120	Their arguments against gay marriage were based on morals and traditions, while the
819120	821440	Democratic arguments revolved entirely around human rights.
821440	824400	And it's ultimately a good thing that Republicans lost that fight.
824400	826220	Or how about the universal healthcare debate?
826220	829680	The Republican opposition to universal healthcare is honestly petty and self-serving.
829680	833480	It's ridiculous to think that America, the greatest nation on the planet, apparently,
833480	837480	cannot adequately tackle the problem of universal healthcare when Canada, the UK, and others
837480	839000	have managed to do it just fine.
839000	843640	However, where the Democrats go wrong on universal healthcare is that it's not a human right.
843640	844640	It's a privilege.
844640	847720	It's a privilege that rich nations can afford to their citizens.
847720	851840	But do you know when exactly rich nations cannot afford this privilege to their citizens?
851840	855520	When the nation is inundated with illegal immigrants that don't pay taxes for the
855520	859800	majority of their lives, earn a fast track to citizenship, and then overburden the healthcare
859800	860800	system.
860800	862300	And this is fundamentally what Democrats have done.
862300	866920	In shutting down the government and all of its related services, over DACA, the Democrats
866920	869340	are sending a message to the American electorate.
869340	872600	Illegal immigrants matter more to us than you, the legal citizens.
872600	875280	We care more about the dreamers than the people who voted us in.
875320	879160	I can only assume that the Democrats realized exactly how ridiculous the situation made
879160	882700	them look, because the shutdown lasted for a weekend, with government returning to business
882700	884140	as usual on Monday.
884140	887980	The matter's been put off until February 8th, so it's really only a matter of days
887980	892240	until we get to see whether or not the Democrats want to tarnish their reputation even further.
892240	896960	So yeah, this idea that the Release the Memo hashtag, and the furor over the contents of
896960	901220	the Nunes memo itself, is just a giant fabrication to distract from the government shutdown,
901220	904640	and the colossal failure of the Republicans to pass a budget with their House and Senate
904640	907280	majorities, just rings hollow to me.
907280	911480	Upon closer inspection, the government shutdown appears to simply be the latest in a year-long
911480	914800	string of regressive left temper tantrums and meltdowns.
914800	918200	A year-long campaign of Democratic self-destruction.
918200	922840	With any luck, the Nunes memo will be released soon, and hopefully the Schiff memo alongside
922840	923840	it.
923840	926240	And in my opinion, that's just going to be the icing on the cake.
929860	933160	And wouldn't you know it, while I was editing this video, the memo released.
933360	935320	I guess I'll get to work on an analysis.
935320	936320	I'll see you guys then.
963640	965720	Let me just say this with all due respect.
965720	967400	You really don't know what you're talking about right now.
