1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
I had intended for my video on the Release the Memo hashtag to be a one and done sort

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,720
of thing, at least until the memo actually dropped.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,600
But there have since been multiple developments, to the point that I think the situation warrants

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,600
a second look.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,220
The mainstream media's eventual response to Release the Memo, after they'd realized

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,360
that simply ignoring it and scrubbing it off Twitter's trending page was not nearly enough,

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,520
was to call everybody interested in the memo's release a bunch of Russian bot accounts and

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,880
not actual people.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,800
And despite this assertion, that no actual human is interested in the contents of the

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,240
Nancy Pelosi said on a live interview with the Democratic Party's propaganda arm, otherwise

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,640
known as CNN, that the entire story is fake anyway.

12
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,040
We can't trust you guys.

13
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,040
Let us read it.

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
Let us figure it out.

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,040
You can redact the names.

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,840
You can make it safe enough for us to look at it because they say the same thing about

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
you.

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,040
That the Russia investigation, there's no collusion.

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,360
You guys are pushing the ball to political advantage to stymie the president.

20
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,080
And they talk about this memo like it should have been in the Raiders of the Lost Ark.

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,360
This thing that this is the holy grail of the truth about what was happening during

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,360
the campaign.

23
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,600
And it points the finger at the Democrats and the FBI.

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,800
Well, let me just say this.

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,520
We're not going to become them, the Republicans, because they are totally irresponsible in

26
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
this regard.

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,760
We're talking about the intelligence community.

28
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,700
We're not talking about some issue that we're having a fight about.

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,300
We're talking about our national security.

30
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,000
As I said, when I've been on that committee, I had been on that committee a long time and

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,480
serve as leader and involved in those issues.

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,460
This is not to be politicized.

33
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,180
This is about fact.

34
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,180
It's about evidence, about data.

35
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:00,960
It's not about making up a false memo based on a false premise that the chairman hasn't

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,420
even read.

37
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,420
And then to put it out there.

38
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,420
So it's not about...

39
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,180
I give you that he hasn't, if he hasn't read it, that's a problem.

40
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,180
We'll take, we'll take that out with this.

41
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,180
How can you decide if you haven't read it, that it should be revealed to the American

42
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,180
people?

43
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,180
Fair point.

44
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,140
But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.

45
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,360
What I'm saying is this.

46
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,940
Are you saying without revealing anything that's confidential, classified, obviously.

47
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,940
I can't do that.

48
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,940
I get it.

49
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,960
Are you saying that if the American people see this memo and they read it and they think

50
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,240
about it, that they could not reasonably conclude that there was any problem with what happened

51
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,320
during the election?

52
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Of course not.

53
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,640
Well then why are they so anxious to release it?

54
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,720
Because it's not even true.

55
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,720
It's not even true.

56
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,820
They have made up a memo that isn't even true.

57
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,760
If it's all fake, Nancy, why the obstruction?

58
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,680
And more importantly, if it's all fake, why do you claim that revealing it will reveal

59
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,000
classified information?

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If the classified information is fake too, who cares?

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,660
Either the memo's contents are fake and then it doesn't matter or the memo's contents

62
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,860
are real and therefore sensitive.

63
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,420
You can't have it both ways.

64
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,160
In fact, I think we should be telling a lot of people that phrase, you can't have it

65
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
both ways.

66
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,700
Hey New York Times, you've written a handful of articles that discuss, both directly and

67
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,000
indirectly, how dangerous it would be to America's national security if its intelligence sources

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,140
were compromised by releasing the Nunes memo.

69
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,500
At the same time though, do you remember when you published the name of a covert CIA official

70
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
back in July of 2017?

71
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,820
You can't have it both ways.

72
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,860
Hey Representative Adam Schiff, you wrote your own memo too, on the same subject as

73
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,860
Nunes?

74
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,860
Well that's great.

75
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,140
How about we release both memos and let the public decide which one is the more accurate

76
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,140
version of the truth?

77
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,800
Wait, you only want yours released and not the Nunes memo?

78
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,140
You can't have it both ways.

79
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,180
Hey Diane Feinstein, remember when your party heavily pushed the narrative that released

80
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,900
the memo was made up of Russian bots and influencers?

81
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,540
Remember when you and Schiff got together to ask Twitter and Facebook to look into the

82
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,540
matter?

83
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,900
What was the response that you got from them?

84
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,820
Oh yeah, Twitter and Facebook basically admitted that the hashtag genuinely went viral.

85
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,700
Well do you guys remember that second letter you sent, demanding that Twitter and Facebook

86
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,980
dig up results that were politically convenient for your point of view?

87
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,180
Well which is it guys?

88
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,700
Do you want the truth or do you want Russian collusion?

89
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,300
You can't have it both ways.

90
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,860
And considering that the Democrats were the party of advocating for peace with the Russians

91
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,020
right up until Trump's election, I find your sudden concern really, really hard to

92
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,020
believe.

93
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,100
However, the Democrats do actually have one possible good point.

94
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,320
This whole release the memo thing might be one giant nothingburger, constructed by the

95
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,380
Republicans in order to distract from the government shutdown, and that's actually

96
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,660
a plausible explanation.

97
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,780
But we're only going to know that if and when the memo is released.

98
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,900
If this version of events is true, it would actually benefit the Democrats if the memo

99
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,000
were made public.

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,540
But considering the democratic resistance to the memo's release, I think this theory

101
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,020
is probably full of hot air.

102
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,340
Nonetheless, the government shutdown can't be ignored.

103
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:52,180
The shutdown began at midnight EST on Saturday, January 20th, 2018, and ended two days later

104
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,020
on Monday, January 22nd.

105
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,900
The shutdown began after a failure to pass legislation to fund government operations

106
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
and agencies.

107
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,980
This stemmed from disputes over the extension of status of persons affected by the Deferred

108
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,860
Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration policy, otherwise known as DACA, and therefore

109
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,740
whether those covered under the program should face deportation.

110
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,660
There was also a dispute over whether funding should be allocated towards building a Mexico-United

111
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,700
States border wall, a keystone policy during Donald Trump's presidential campaign.

112
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,340
Well shit, that sounds like a big deal.

113
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,980
I know that in parliamentary systems, failure to pass a budget automatically triggers a

114
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,260
dissolution of parliament and election for all the seats therein.

115
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,440
Maybe you Americans should adopt something similar.

116
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,400
The prospect of every congressman losing their jobs might make government shutdowns a last

117
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,380
resort instead of simply another political pressure point.

118
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,140
In any case, what's this DACA immigration policy that's got everybody up in arms?

119
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,620
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals was an American immigration policy that allowed

120
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,720
some individuals who entered the country as minors and had either entered or remained

121
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,740
in the country illegally to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation

122
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,580
and to be eligible for a work permit.

123
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,760
As of 2017, approximately 800,000 individuals were enrolled in the program created by DACA.

124
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,500
The policy was established by the Obama administration in June 2012 and was rescinded by the Trump

125
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,700
administration in September 2017.

126
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,940
The policy was established by executive action rather than legislation.

127
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,700
However, participating individuals were sometimes referred to as DREAMers after the DREAM Act,

128
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,800
a bipartisan bill first proposed in 2001 that was the first of a number of subsequent bills

129
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,500
in the U.S. House and Senate attempting to provide a pathway to citizenship or other

130
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,040
legal status for certain undocumented residents who immigrated illegally as children and

131
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,820
subsequently completed some college or military service.

132
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,420
So let me see if I have this straight.

133
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,860
Illegal immigrants bring their kids to the United States with them.

134
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,060
None of them are legal immigrants but the kids, being kids, are not at fault.

135
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,060
Their parents are.

136
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,500
Because the kids aren't at fault themselves, DACA proponents wanted to give them a free pass.

137
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,700
After all, they only broke immigration law because their parents forced them to.

138
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,140
Some of these kids have grown up in the USA and are entirely culturally American, if not

139
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,340
legally, with no connection to their home country.

140
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,920
And like I said before, these kids are called DREAMers after the DREAM Act.

141
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,660
But what is that DREAM Act?

142
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,860
The DREAM Act, acronym for Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, is an

143
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,820
American legislative proposal for a multi-phase process for qualifying alien minors in the

144
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,420
United States that would first grant conditional residency and, upon meeting further qualifications,

145
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,460
permanent residency.

146
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,000
The bill was first introduced in the Senate on August 1st, 2001, and has since been reintroduced

147
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,940
several times but has failed to pass.

148
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,580
Oh, so they're called DREAMers based on an act that failed to pass into law.

149
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,340
It's not like this path to citizenship was once legalized and then later revoked, unfairly

150
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,280
pulling the rug out from people who had already started working down the path.

151
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,760
It was never legal at all.

152
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,800
And why is there such a commotion about DREAMers in the first place?

153
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,360
Well, it turns out there's actually a decent argument for allowing DREAMers to stay.

154
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,160
DREAMers have no connection to the country they're actually citizens of.

155
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,200
They generally can't speak the language or participate in the culture.

156
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,360
They're fully Americanized and have participated in American life for as long as they can remember.

157
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,800
They didn't mean to illegally immigrate, their parents forced them to do it.

158
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,320
Surely, if any illegal immigrants deserved a fast track to citizenship, it would be these

159
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
people, right?

160
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Maybe so.

161
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,240
With the point of view of the DREAMers, it seems like the only right thing to do.

162
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,360
But let's look at it from the point of view of the government.

163
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,640
The US government has a real, tangible interest in preventing illegal immigration as well

164
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,720
as a real, tangible interest in prioritizing legal immigration as the preferred, and only,

165
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,920
way for non-citizens to become citizens.

166
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,280
I don't think anybody would seriously dispute this premise, with the exception of the most

167
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,360
radical anarcho-communists and Moviebob.

168
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,660
And neither of them are worth serious consideration.

169
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,460
So if the US government were to grant blanket amnesty to all DREAMers because they were

170
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,660
children at the time of their illegal immigration and therefore not to blame, and are, in every

171
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:41,980
other way, adult Americans, that would still require the deportation or incarceration of

172
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:46,260
the parents of DREAMers, because those people are responsible, they weren't children when

173
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,220
they crossed the border, and they did knowingly break the law.

174
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,880
The parents of DREAMers are just straight up illegal immigrants, they're not DREAMers

175
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
themselves.

176
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,700
There's no hazy middle ground here, they failed to work through the legal immigration

177
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,180
proceedings, or the legal refugee proceedings, or the legal proceedings for work or school

178
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,180
permits.

179
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,820
They simply broke immigration law.

180
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,220
Secondly, in bringing their children with them, the children that would later grow up

181
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,020
to be the DREAMers, they broke child trafficking laws as well.

182
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,340
Even if the DREAMers get the free pass they want, their parents are still criminals and

183
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,220
need to answer for their crimes.

184
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,860
Thirdly, illegal immigration is not a victimless crime.

185
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,760
Even if we discount the drug or gang related violence that some illegal immigrants bring

186
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,200
with them, even peaceful illegal immigrants have a negative effect on the job market.

187
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,440
When a nation takes in an influx of cheap labour, the working class's wages are driven

188
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,200
down, as companies can afford to hire people who will do the same job for the cheapest

189
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
wage.

190
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,840
When the pool of workers is smaller, wages inflate, as companies compete to attract what

191
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,040
they need from a smaller available selection.

192
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,680
It's all about supply and demand.

193
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,280
Oh, you don't believe me?

194
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,540
Well how about we read this paper on the subject?

195
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,920
Illegal immigration, the impact on wages and employment of black workers.

196
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,100
The willingness of policy makers to tolerate the presence of illegal immigrants in the

197
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,560
nation's labour force exposes a seemly side of the nation's collective consciousness.

198
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,760
Illegal immigrants, who themselves are often exploited even though they may not think so,

199
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,760
are allowed to cause harm in the form of unemployment and depressed wages to the most vulnerable

200
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,500
workers in the American workforce.

201
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,040
The continued reluctance by our national government to get illegal immigrants out of the labour

202
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,600
force, and to keep them out, by enforcing the existing sanctions at the worksite against

203
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,600
employers of illegal immigrants, is itself a massive violation of the civil rights of

204
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,320
all low skilled workers in the United States, and of low skilled black workers in particular.

205
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,960
Illegal immigrants have no right to work in the United States.

206
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,420
In fact, they have no right to even be in the country.

207
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,880
Enforcing our nation's labour laws, including the protection of the legal labour force from

208
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,780
the presence of illegal immigrant workers, is the civil rights issue of this generation

209
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,100
of American workers.

210
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,500
It is time, therefore, to make our immigration laws credible.

211
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,280
The way to do this is to adhere to the findings of the US Commission on Immigration Reform,

212
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,520
chaired by the late Barbara Jordan, who boldly stated what should be the goal of public policy.

213
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,640
The credibility of immigration policy can be measured by a simple yardstick.

214
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,080
People who should get in do get in, people who should not get in are kept out, and people

215
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,620
who are judged a portable are required to leave.

216
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,840
No one would benefit more by the adherence to that standard than would low skilled black

217
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,680
American workers and their families.

218
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,560
I don't know guys, it's almost like the best way to harm the 1% in America and help

219
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,120
poor black workers in the process is to remove illegal labour from the picture.

220
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,360
It's almost like all the white middle class democrats who demand programs like DACA want

221
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,220
to offer up token efforts in the face of their own white guilt, all the while not caring

222
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,440
what actually happens to their fellow black citizens, who they don't have to interact

223
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,840
with or answer to.

224
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,260
But most importantly of all, it would send future illegal immigrants a message.

225
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,220
Send your babies to the USA.

226
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,880
Even if you get caught, your child will be forgiven and granted a frontline pass to citizenship,

227
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,720
bypassing all those other plebs who are working through the legal process, as long as you

228
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,320
manage to raise them for long enough in the USA that they become sufficiently American.

229
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,660
Granting Dreamers blanket amnesty would only incentivize future illegal immigrants to bypass

230
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,280
legal immigration structures, if they thought that breaking the law would be good for their

231
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
children.

232
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,640
And if this sounds like just conjecture, I'd like to remind you that this has happened

233
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
before.

234
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,360
In 1986, the Immigration Reform and Control Act was passed.

235
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,120
Part of the act provided an easy path to citizenship for illegal immigrants that had arrived in

236
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,940
the United States before 1982.

237
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,040
This was agreed to as a compromise.

238
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,680
America's illegal immigrant population could no longer be ignored, and the solution was

239
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,880
to provide an easy path to citizenship for those already in the USA in exchange for stricter

240
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,960
enforcement of the law towards future illegal immigrants.

241
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,100
Critics of this compromise believe that the IRCA's implementation would embolden future

242
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,440
illegal immigrants in their attempts to hop the border, because it would be taken as proof

243
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,120
that the USA, if pushed enough, would rather grant amnesty to illegal immigrants rather

244
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,200
than deport them.

245
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,320
And judging by the massively inflated population of Dreamers we're now dealing with thirty

246
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,920
years later, I'd say that this criticism was probably correct.

247
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,680
But let's rewind this whole thing back to the government shutdown.

248
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,680
Trump rescinds the DACA policy, which allowed Dreamers, the undocumented children of illegal

249
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,840
immigrants, to stay in the USA indefinitely.

250
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,920
And the Democratic Party decided that their best response to this was to filibuster the

251
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,840
federal budget bill in the Senate, shutting the government down.

252
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,960
Let me repeat that.

253
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,040
Because people in the USA illegally lost their ability to remain in the USA illegally, because

254
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,840
the US government exercised the sovereign right of any nation on earth, the right to

255
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,440
determine which foreigners have the privilege of entering or staying within the country,

256
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,080
the Democrats shut down the government.

257
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
One more time.

258
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,560
The Democrats shut down the government because illegal immigrants were going to start getting

259
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,560
deported again.

260
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,660
I don't even know where to start on this, you guys.

261
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,860
I remember when the Democratic Party advocated for reasonable things.

262
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,240
Gay marriage, for example.

263
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,240
It was obvious to anybody with a brain that Republicans were on the wrong side of the

264
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,280
gay marriage issue.

265
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,120
Their arguments against gay marriage were based on morals and traditions, while the

266
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,440
Democratic arguments revolved entirely around human rights.

267
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,400
And it's ultimately a good thing that Republicans lost that fight.

268
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,220
Or how about the universal healthcare debate?

269
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,680
The Republican opposition to universal healthcare is honestly petty and self-serving.

270
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,480
It's ridiculous to think that America, the greatest nation on the planet, apparently,

271
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,480
cannot adequately tackle the problem of universal healthcare when Canada, the UK, and others

272
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,000
have managed to do it just fine.

273
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,640
However, where the Democrats go wrong on universal healthcare is that it's not a human right.

274
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
It's a privilege.

275
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,720
It's a privilege that rich nations can afford to their citizens.

276
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,840
But do you know when exactly rich nations cannot afford this privilege to their citizens?

277
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,520
When the nation is inundated with illegal immigrants that don't pay taxes for the

278
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,800
majority of their lives, earn a fast track to citizenship, and then overburden the healthcare

279
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
system.

280
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,300
And this is fundamentally what Democrats have done.

281
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,920
In shutting down the government and all of its related services, over DACA, the Democrats

282
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,340
are sending a message to the American electorate.

283
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,600
Illegal immigrants matter more to us than you, the legal citizens.

284
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,280
We care more about the dreamers than the people who voted us in.

285
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,160
I can only assume that the Democrats realized exactly how ridiculous the situation made

286
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,700
them look, because the shutdown lasted for a weekend, with government returning to business

287
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,140
as usual on Monday.

288
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,980
The matter's been put off until February 8th, so it's really only a matter of days

289
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,240
until we get to see whether or not the Democrats want to tarnish their reputation even further.

290
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,960
So yeah, this idea that the Release the Memo hashtag, and the furor over the contents of

291
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,220
the Nunes memo itself, is just a giant fabrication to distract from the government shutdown,

292
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,640
and the colossal failure of the Republicans to pass a budget with their House and Senate

293
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,280
majorities, just rings hollow to me.

294
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,480
Upon closer inspection, the government shutdown appears to simply be the latest in a year-long

295
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,800
string of regressive left temper tantrums and meltdowns.

296
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,200
A year-long campaign of Democratic self-destruction.

297
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,840
With any luck, the Nunes memo will be released soon, and hopefully the Schiff memo alongside

298
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,840
it.

299
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,240
And in my opinion, that's just going to be the icing on the cake.

300
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,160
And wouldn't you know it, while I was editing this video, the memo released.

301
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,320
I guess I'll get to work on an analysis.

302
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
I'll see you guys then.

303
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,720
Let me just say this with all due respect.

304
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,400
You really don't know what you're talking about right now.
