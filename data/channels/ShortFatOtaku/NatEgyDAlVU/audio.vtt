00:00.000 --> 00:04.200
I had intended for my video on the Release the Memo hashtag to be a one and done sort

00:04.200 --> 00:06.720
of thing, at least until the memo actually dropped.

00:06.720 --> 00:10.600
But there have since been multiple developments, to the point that I think the situation warrants

00:10.600 --> 00:11.600
a second look.

00:11.600 --> 00:15.220
The mainstream media's eventual response to Release the Memo, after they'd realized

00:15.220 --> 00:19.360
that simply ignoring it and scrubbing it off Twitter's trending page was not nearly enough,

00:19.360 --> 00:23.520
was to call everybody interested in the memo's release a bunch of Russian bot accounts and

00:23.520 --> 00:24.880
not actual people.

00:24.880 --> 00:28.800
And despite this assertion, that no actual human is interested in the contents of the

00:29.800 --> 00:34.240
Nancy Pelosi said on a live interview with the Democratic Party's propaganda arm, otherwise

00:34.240 --> 00:37.640
known as CNN, that the entire story is fake anyway.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.040
We can't trust you guys.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.040
Let us read it.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.040
Let us figure it out.

01:02.040 --> 01:03.040
You can redact the names.

01:03.040 --> 01:05.840
You can make it safe enough for us to look at it because they say the same thing about

01:05.840 --> 01:06.840
you.

01:06.840 --> 01:09.040
That the Russia investigation, there's no collusion.

01:09.040 --> 01:12.360
You guys are pushing the ball to political advantage to stymie the president.

01:12.360 --> 01:17.080
And they talk about this memo like it should have been in the Raiders of the Lost Ark.

01:17.080 --> 01:21.360
This thing that this is the holy grail of the truth about what was happening during

01:21.360 --> 01:22.360
the campaign.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.600
And it points the finger at the Democrats and the FBI.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.800
Well, let me just say this.

01:26.800 --> 01:31.520
We're not going to become them, the Republicans, because they are totally irresponsible in

01:31.520 --> 01:32.520
this regard.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.760
We're talking about the intelligence community.

01:34.760 --> 01:38.700
We're not talking about some issue that we're having a fight about.

01:38.700 --> 01:41.300
We're talking about our national security.

01:41.300 --> 01:45.000
As I said, when I've been on that committee, I had been on that committee a long time and

01:45.000 --> 01:48.480
serve as leader and involved in those issues.

01:48.480 --> 01:51.460
This is not to be politicized.

01:51.460 --> 01:53.180
This is about fact.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.180
It's about evidence, about data.

01:55.180 --> 02:00.960
It's not about making up a false memo based on a false premise that the chairman hasn't

02:00.960 --> 02:02.420
even read.

02:02.420 --> 02:03.420
And then to put it out there.

02:03.420 --> 02:04.420
So it's not about...

02:04.420 --> 02:06.180
I give you that he hasn't, if he hasn't read it, that's a problem.

02:06.180 --> 02:08.180
We'll take, we'll take that out with this.

02:08.180 --> 02:12.180
How can you decide if you haven't read it, that it should be revealed to the American

02:12.180 --> 02:13.180
people?

02:13.180 --> 02:14.180
Fair point.

02:14.180 --> 02:18.140
But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.

02:18.140 --> 02:19.360
What I'm saying is this.

02:19.360 --> 02:22.940
Are you saying without revealing anything that's confidential, classified, obviously.

02:22.940 --> 02:23.940
I can't do that.

02:23.940 --> 02:24.940
I get it.

02:25.700 --> 02:28.960
Are you saying that if the American people see this memo and they read it and they think

02:28.960 --> 02:33.240
about it, that they could not reasonably conclude that there was any problem with what happened

02:33.240 --> 02:34.320
during the election?

02:34.320 --> 02:35.320
Of course not.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.640
Well then why are they so anxious to release it?

02:37.640 --> 02:39.720
Because it's not even true.

02:39.720 --> 02:40.720
It's not even true.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.820
They have made up a memo that isn't even true.

02:43.820 --> 02:46.760
If it's all fake, Nancy, why the obstruction?

02:46.760 --> 02:50.680
And more importantly, if it's all fake, why do you claim that revealing it will reveal

02:50.680 --> 02:52.000
classified information?

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
If the classified information is fake too, who cares?

02:55.000 --> 02:58.660
Either the memo's contents are fake and then it doesn't matter or the memo's contents

02:58.660 --> 03:00.860
are real and therefore sensitive.

03:00.860 --> 03:02.420
You can't have it both ways.

03:02.420 --> 03:06.160
In fact, I think we should be telling a lot of people that phrase, you can't have it

03:06.160 --> 03:07.160
both ways.

03:07.160 --> 03:11.700
Hey New York Times, you've written a handful of articles that discuss, both directly and

03:11.700 --> 03:16.000
indirectly, how dangerous it would be to America's national security if its intelligence sources

03:16.000 --> 03:18.140
were compromised by releasing the Nunes memo.

03:18.140 --> 03:22.500
At the same time though, do you remember when you published the name of a covert CIA official

03:22.500 --> 03:24.500
back in July of 2017?

03:24.500 --> 03:25.820
You can't have it both ways.

03:25.820 --> 03:29.860
Hey Representative Adam Schiff, you wrote your own memo too, on the same subject as

03:29.860 --> 03:30.860
Nunes?

03:30.860 --> 03:31.860
Well that's great.

03:31.860 --> 03:35.140
How about we release both memos and let the public decide which one is the more accurate

03:35.140 --> 03:36.140
version of the truth?

03:36.140 --> 03:39.800
Wait, you only want yours released and not the Nunes memo?

03:39.800 --> 03:41.140
You can't have it both ways.

03:41.140 --> 03:45.180
Hey Diane Feinstein, remember when your party heavily pushed the narrative that released

03:45.180 --> 03:47.900
the memo was made up of Russian bots and influencers?

03:47.900 --> 03:51.540
Remember when you and Schiff got together to ask Twitter and Facebook to look into the

03:51.540 --> 03:52.540
matter?

03:52.540 --> 03:53.900
What was the response that you got from them?

03:53.900 --> 03:58.820
Oh yeah, Twitter and Facebook basically admitted that the hashtag genuinely went viral.

03:58.820 --> 04:02.700
Well do you guys remember that second letter you sent, demanding that Twitter and Facebook

04:02.700 --> 04:05.980
dig up results that were politically convenient for your point of view?

04:05.980 --> 04:07.180
Well which is it guys?

04:07.180 --> 04:09.700
Do you want the truth or do you want Russian collusion?

04:09.700 --> 04:11.300
You can't have it both ways.

04:11.300 --> 04:14.860
And considering that the Democrats were the party of advocating for peace with the Russians

04:14.860 --> 04:19.020
right up until Trump's election, I find your sudden concern really, really hard to

04:19.020 --> 04:20.020
believe.

04:20.020 --> 04:23.100
However, the Democrats do actually have one possible good point.

04:23.100 --> 04:27.320
This whole release the memo thing might be one giant nothingburger, constructed by the

04:27.320 --> 04:30.380
Republicans in order to distract from the government shutdown, and that's actually

04:30.380 --> 04:31.660
a plausible explanation.

04:31.660 --> 04:34.780
But we're only going to know that if and when the memo is released.

04:34.780 --> 04:37.900
If this version of events is true, it would actually benefit the Democrats if the memo

04:37.900 --> 04:39.000
were made public.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.540
But considering the democratic resistance to the memo's release, I think this theory

04:42.540 --> 04:44.020
is probably full of hot air.

04:44.020 --> 04:46.340
Nonetheless, the government shutdown can't be ignored.

04:46.340 --> 04:52.180
The shutdown began at midnight EST on Saturday, January 20th, 2018, and ended two days later

04:52.180 --> 04:54.020
on Monday, January 22nd.

04:54.020 --> 04:57.900
The shutdown began after a failure to pass legislation to fund government operations

04:57.900 --> 04:58.900
and agencies.

04:58.900 --> 05:02.980
This stemmed from disputes over the extension of status of persons affected by the Deferred

05:02.980 --> 05:07.860
Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration policy, otherwise known as DACA, and therefore

05:07.860 --> 05:10.740
whether those covered under the program should face deportation.

05:10.740 --> 05:14.660
There was also a dispute over whether funding should be allocated towards building a Mexico-United

05:14.660 --> 05:18.700
States border wall, a keystone policy during Donald Trump's presidential campaign.

05:18.700 --> 05:20.340
Well shit, that sounds like a big deal.

05:20.340 --> 05:23.980
I know that in parliamentary systems, failure to pass a budget automatically triggers a

05:23.980 --> 05:27.260
dissolution of parliament and election for all the seats therein.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.440
Maybe you Americans should adopt something similar.

05:29.440 --> 05:33.400
The prospect of every congressman losing their jobs might make government shutdowns a last

05:33.400 --> 05:36.380
resort instead of simply another political pressure point.

05:36.380 --> 05:40.140
In any case, what's this DACA immigration policy that's got everybody up in arms?

05:40.180 --> 05:43.620
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals was an American immigration policy that allowed

05:43.620 --> 05:47.720
some individuals who entered the country as minors and had either entered or remained

05:47.720 --> 05:52.740
in the country illegally to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation

05:52.740 --> 05:54.580
and to be eligible for a work permit.

05:54.580 --> 05:59.760
As of 2017, approximately 800,000 individuals were enrolled in the program created by DACA.

05:59.760 --> 06:04.500
The policy was established by the Obama administration in June 2012 and was rescinded by the Trump

06:04.500 --> 06:06.700
administration in September 2017.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.940
The policy was established by executive action rather than legislation.

06:09.940 --> 06:14.700
However, participating individuals were sometimes referred to as DREAMers after the DREAM Act,

06:14.700 --> 06:19.800
a bipartisan bill first proposed in 2001 that was the first of a number of subsequent bills

06:19.800 --> 06:23.500
in the U.S. House and Senate attempting to provide a pathway to citizenship or other

06:23.500 --> 06:28.040
legal status for certain undocumented residents who immigrated illegally as children and

06:28.040 --> 06:30.820
subsequently completed some college or military service.

06:30.820 --> 06:32.420
So let me see if I have this straight.

06:32.420 --> 06:34.860
Illegal immigrants bring their kids to the United States with them.

06:34.860 --> 06:39.060
None of them are legal immigrants but the kids, being kids, are not at fault.

06:39.060 --> 06:40.060
Their parents are.

06:40.060 --> 06:44.500
Because the kids aren't at fault themselves, DACA proponents wanted to give them a free pass.

06:44.500 --> 06:47.700
After all, they only broke immigration law because their parents forced them to.

06:47.700 --> 06:52.140
Some of these kids have grown up in the USA and are entirely culturally American, if not

06:52.140 --> 06:54.340
legally, with no connection to their home country.

06:54.340 --> 06:57.920
And like I said before, these kids are called DREAMers after the DREAM Act.

06:57.920 --> 06:59.660
But what is that DREAM Act?

06:59.660 --> 07:04.860
The DREAM Act, acronym for Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, is an

07:04.860 --> 07:09.820
American legislative proposal for a multi-phase process for qualifying alien minors in the

07:09.820 --> 07:14.420
United States that would first grant conditional residency and, upon meeting further qualifications,

07:14.420 --> 07:15.460
permanent residency.

07:15.460 --> 07:20.000
The bill was first introduced in the Senate on August 1st, 2001, and has since been reintroduced

07:20.000 --> 07:21.940
several times but has failed to pass.

07:21.940 --> 07:25.580
Oh, so they're called DREAMers based on an act that failed to pass into law.

07:25.580 --> 07:30.340
It's not like this path to citizenship was once legalized and then later revoked, unfairly

07:30.340 --> 07:33.280
pulling the rug out from people who had already started working down the path.

07:33.280 --> 07:34.760
It was never legal at all.

07:34.760 --> 07:37.800
And why is there such a commotion about DREAMers in the first place?

07:37.800 --> 07:42.360
Well, it turns out there's actually a decent argument for allowing DREAMers to stay.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.160
DREAMers have no connection to the country they're actually citizens of.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.200
They generally can't speak the language or participate in the culture.

07:48.200 --> 07:52.360
They're fully Americanized and have participated in American life for as long as they can remember.

07:52.360 --> 07:55.800
They didn't mean to illegally immigrate, their parents forced them to do it.

07:55.800 --> 08:00.320
Surely, if any illegal immigrants deserved a fast track to citizenship, it would be these

08:00.320 --> 08:01.320
people, right?

08:01.320 --> 08:02.320
Maybe so.

08:02.320 --> 08:05.240
With the point of view of the DREAMers, it seems like the only right thing to do.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.360
But let's look at it from the point of view of the government.

08:07.360 --> 08:11.640
The US government has a real, tangible interest in preventing illegal immigration as well

08:11.640 --> 08:16.720
as a real, tangible interest in prioritizing legal immigration as the preferred, and only,

08:16.720 --> 08:18.920
way for non-citizens to become citizens.

08:18.920 --> 08:23.280
I don't think anybody would seriously dispute this premise, with the exception of the most

08:23.280 --> 08:26.360
radical anarcho-communists and Moviebob.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.660
And neither of them are worth serious consideration.

08:28.660 --> 08:32.460
So if the US government were to grant blanket amnesty to all DREAMers because they were

08:32.460 --> 08:36.660
children at the time of their illegal immigration and therefore not to blame, and are, in every

08:36.660 --> 08:41.980
other way, adult Americans, that would still require the deportation or incarceration of

08:41.980 --> 08:46.260
the parents of DREAMers, because those people are responsible, they weren't children when

08:46.260 --> 08:49.220
they crossed the border, and they did knowingly break the law.

08:49.220 --> 08:52.880
The parents of DREAMers are just straight up illegal immigrants, they're not DREAMers

08:52.880 --> 08:53.880
themselves.

08:53.880 --> 08:57.700
There's no hazy middle ground here, they failed to work through the legal immigration

08:57.700 --> 09:02.180
proceedings, or the legal refugee proceedings, or the legal proceedings for work or school

09:02.180 --> 09:03.180
permits.

09:03.180 --> 09:04.820
They simply broke immigration law.

09:04.820 --> 09:08.220
Secondly, in bringing their children with them, the children that would later grow up

09:08.220 --> 09:12.020
to be the DREAMers, they broke child trafficking laws as well.

09:12.020 --> 09:16.340
Even if the DREAMers get the free pass they want, their parents are still criminals and

09:16.340 --> 09:18.220
need to answer for their crimes.

09:18.220 --> 09:21.860
Thirdly, illegal immigration is not a victimless crime.

09:21.860 --> 09:25.760
Even if we discount the drug or gang related violence that some illegal immigrants bring

09:25.760 --> 09:30.200
with them, even peaceful illegal immigrants have a negative effect on the job market.

09:30.200 --> 09:34.440
When a nation takes in an influx of cheap labour, the working class's wages are driven

09:34.440 --> 09:38.200
down, as companies can afford to hire people who will do the same job for the cheapest

09:38.200 --> 09:39.200
wage.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.840
When the pool of workers is smaller, wages inflate, as companies compete to attract what

09:42.840 --> 09:45.040
they need from a smaller available selection.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.680
It's all about supply and demand.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.280
Oh, you don't believe me?

09:48.280 --> 09:50.540
Well how about we read this paper on the subject?

09:50.540 --> 09:54.920
Illegal immigration, the impact on wages and employment of black workers.

09:54.920 --> 09:58.100
The willingness of policy makers to tolerate the presence of illegal immigrants in the

09:58.100 --> 10:02.560
nation's labour force exposes a seemly side of the nation's collective consciousness.

10:02.560 --> 10:06.760
Illegal immigrants, who themselves are often exploited even though they may not think so,

10:06.760 --> 10:10.760
are allowed to cause harm in the form of unemployment and depressed wages to the most vulnerable

10:10.760 --> 10:12.500
workers in the American workforce.

10:12.500 --> 10:16.040
The continued reluctance by our national government to get illegal immigrants out of the labour

10:16.040 --> 10:20.600
force, and to keep them out, by enforcing the existing sanctions at the worksite against

10:20.600 --> 10:24.600
employers of illegal immigrants, is itself a massive violation of the civil rights of

10:24.600 --> 10:29.320
all low skilled workers in the United States, and of low skilled black workers in particular.

10:29.320 --> 10:31.960
Illegal immigrants have no right to work in the United States.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.420
In fact, they have no right to even be in the country.

10:34.420 --> 10:37.880
Enforcing our nation's labour laws, including the protection of the legal labour force from

10:37.880 --> 10:41.780
the presence of illegal immigrant workers, is the civil rights issue of this generation

10:41.780 --> 10:43.100
of American workers.

10:43.100 --> 10:46.500
It is time, therefore, to make our immigration laws credible.

10:46.500 --> 10:50.280
The way to do this is to adhere to the findings of the US Commission on Immigration Reform,

10:50.280 --> 10:54.520
chaired by the late Barbara Jordan, who boldly stated what should be the goal of public policy.

10:54.520 --> 10:58.640
The credibility of immigration policy can be measured by a simple yardstick.

10:58.640 --> 11:03.080
People who should get in do get in, people who should not get in are kept out, and people

11:03.080 --> 11:05.620
who are judged a portable are required to leave.

11:05.620 --> 11:09.840
No one would benefit more by the adherence to that standard than would low skilled black

11:09.840 --> 11:11.680
American workers and their families.

11:11.680 --> 11:16.560
I don't know guys, it's almost like the best way to harm the 1% in America and help

11:16.560 --> 11:20.120
poor black workers in the process is to remove illegal labour from the picture.

11:20.120 --> 11:24.360
It's almost like all the white middle class democrats who demand programs like DACA want

11:24.360 --> 11:28.220
to offer up token efforts in the face of their own white guilt, all the while not caring

11:28.220 --> 11:31.440
what actually happens to their fellow black citizens, who they don't have to interact

11:31.440 --> 11:32.840
with or answer to.

11:32.840 --> 11:37.260
But most importantly of all, it would send future illegal immigrants a message.

11:37.260 --> 11:39.220
Send your babies to the USA.

11:39.220 --> 11:43.880
Even if you get caught, your child will be forgiven and granted a frontline pass to citizenship,

11:43.880 --> 11:47.720
bypassing all those other plebs who are working through the legal process, as long as you

11:47.720 --> 11:52.320
manage to raise them for long enough in the USA that they become sufficiently American.

11:52.320 --> 11:56.660
Granting Dreamers blanket amnesty would only incentivize future illegal immigrants to bypass

11:56.660 --> 12:00.280
legal immigration structures, if they thought that breaking the law would be good for their

12:00.280 --> 12:01.280
children.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.640
And if this sounds like just conjecture, I'd like to remind you that this has happened

12:04.640 --> 12:05.640
before.

12:05.640 --> 12:09.360
In 1986, the Immigration Reform and Control Act was passed.

12:09.360 --> 12:13.120
Part of the act provided an easy path to citizenship for illegal immigrants that had arrived in

12:13.120 --> 12:14.940
the United States before 1982.

12:14.940 --> 12:17.040
This was agreed to as a compromise.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.680
America's illegal immigrant population could no longer be ignored, and the solution was

12:20.680 --> 12:24.880
to provide an easy path to citizenship for those already in the USA in exchange for stricter

12:24.880 --> 12:27.960
enforcement of the law towards future illegal immigrants.

12:27.960 --> 12:32.100
Critics of this compromise believe that the IRCA's implementation would embolden future

12:32.100 --> 12:35.440
illegal immigrants in their attempts to hop the border, because it would be taken as proof

12:35.440 --> 12:40.120
that the USA, if pushed enough, would rather grant amnesty to illegal immigrants rather

12:40.120 --> 12:41.200
than deport them.

12:41.200 --> 12:45.320
And judging by the massively inflated population of Dreamers we're now dealing with thirty

12:45.320 --> 12:47.920
years later, I'd say that this criticism was probably correct.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.680
But let's rewind this whole thing back to the government shutdown.

12:50.680 --> 12:54.680
Trump rescinds the DACA policy, which allowed Dreamers, the undocumented children of illegal

12:54.680 --> 12:56.840
immigrants, to stay in the USA indefinitely.

12:56.840 --> 13:00.920
And the Democratic Party decided that their best response to this was to filibuster the

13:00.920 --> 13:03.840
federal budget bill in the Senate, shutting the government down.

13:03.840 --> 13:04.960
Let me repeat that.

13:04.960 --> 13:10.040
Because people in the USA illegally lost their ability to remain in the USA illegally, because

13:10.040 --> 13:13.840
the US government exercised the sovereign right of any nation on earth, the right to

13:13.840 --> 13:17.440
determine which foreigners have the privilege of entering or staying within the country,

13:17.440 --> 13:19.080
the Democrats shut down the government.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.080
One more time.

13:20.080 --> 13:23.560
The Democrats shut down the government because illegal immigrants were going to start getting

13:23.560 --> 13:24.560
deported again.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.660
I don't even know where to start on this, you guys.

13:26.660 --> 13:29.860
I remember when the Democratic Party advocated for reasonable things.

13:29.860 --> 13:31.240
Gay marriage, for example.

13:31.240 --> 13:34.240
It was obvious to anybody with a brain that Republicans were on the wrong side of the

13:34.240 --> 13:35.280
gay marriage issue.

13:35.280 --> 13:39.120
Their arguments against gay marriage were based on morals and traditions, while the

13:39.120 --> 13:41.440
Democratic arguments revolved entirely around human rights.

13:41.440 --> 13:44.400
And it's ultimately a good thing that Republicans lost that fight.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.220
Or how about the universal healthcare debate?

13:46.220 --> 13:49.680
The Republican opposition to universal healthcare is honestly petty and self-serving.

13:49.680 --> 13:53.480
It's ridiculous to think that America, the greatest nation on the planet, apparently,

13:53.480 --> 13:57.480
cannot adequately tackle the problem of universal healthcare when Canada, the UK, and others

13:57.480 --> 13:59.000
have managed to do it just fine.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.640
However, where the Democrats go wrong on universal healthcare is that it's not a human right.

14:03.640 --> 14:04.640
It's a privilege.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.720
It's a privilege that rich nations can afford to their citizens.

14:07.720 --> 14:11.840
But do you know when exactly rich nations cannot afford this privilege to their citizens?

14:11.840 --> 14:15.520
When the nation is inundated with illegal immigrants that don't pay taxes for the

14:15.520 --> 14:19.800
majority of their lives, earn a fast track to citizenship, and then overburden the healthcare

14:19.800 --> 14:20.800
system.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.300
And this is fundamentally what Democrats have done.

14:22.300 --> 14:26.920
In shutting down the government and all of its related services, over DACA, the Democrats

14:26.920 --> 14:29.340
are sending a message to the American electorate.

14:29.340 --> 14:32.600
Illegal immigrants matter more to us than you, the legal citizens.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.280
We care more about the dreamers than the people who voted us in.

14:35.320 --> 14:39.160
I can only assume that the Democrats realized exactly how ridiculous the situation made

14:39.160 --> 14:42.700
them look, because the shutdown lasted for a weekend, with government returning to business

14:42.700 --> 14:44.140
as usual on Monday.

14:44.140 --> 14:47.980
The matter's been put off until February 8th, so it's really only a matter of days

14:47.980 --> 14:52.240
until we get to see whether or not the Democrats want to tarnish their reputation even further.

14:52.240 --> 14:56.960
So yeah, this idea that the Release the Memo hashtag, and the furor over the contents of

14:56.960 --> 15:01.220
the Nunes memo itself, is just a giant fabrication to distract from the government shutdown,

15:01.220 --> 15:04.640
and the colossal failure of the Republicans to pass a budget with their House and Senate

15:04.640 --> 15:07.280
majorities, just rings hollow to me.

15:07.280 --> 15:11.480
Upon closer inspection, the government shutdown appears to simply be the latest in a year-long

15:11.480 --> 15:14.800
string of regressive left temper tantrums and meltdowns.

15:14.800 --> 15:18.200
A year-long campaign of Democratic self-destruction.

15:18.200 --> 15:22.840
With any luck, the Nunes memo will be released soon, and hopefully the Schiff memo alongside

15:22.840 --> 15:23.840
it.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.240
And in my opinion, that's just going to be the icing on the cake.

15:29.860 --> 15:33.160
And wouldn't you know it, while I was editing this video, the memo released.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.320
I guess I'll get to work on an analysis.

15:35.320 --> 15:36.320
I'll see you guys then.

16:03.640 --> 16:05.720
Let me just say this with all due respect.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.400
You really don't know what you're talking about right now.
