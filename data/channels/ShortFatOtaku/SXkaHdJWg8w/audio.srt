00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,760
When I was writing the script for yesterday's video, the Pronouns and Bio one, I realized

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,080
something about the Pronouns Wiki.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,960
Yeah, it was pretty fun to go down rabbit holes and see all of the weird terms they've

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,040
invented for concepts that don't really exist, but it's more than that.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,520
Normies who are a lot less plugged into things who come across this wiki would be utterly

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,520
bamboozled.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,300
Nobody's going to understand this shit.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,560
An image made the rounds on social media recently that made me think the same thing.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,560
Check this out.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,480
What is solo poly?

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,940
Sole polyamory is a type of polyamorous configuration.

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,740
Solo poly people tend to see their selves as their own primary.

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,780
They usually have multiple separate or intertwined polyamorous dynamics.

14
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,920
They are committed to their polyamorous relationships.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,440
They don't depend on the relationship escalator to express their commitment.

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,640
Well, what the fuck does this all mean?

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
Polyamory is pretty obvious.

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,780
It's when you have a committed relationship with more than one other person, as opposed

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,620
to an open relationship, which is when you're romantically committed to one person, but

20
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,940
you're both fucking other people separately.

21
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,120
Or a polycule, which is the extended connections and chains of relationships between people

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,620
who are non-exclusive.

23
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,780
A primary in this vocabulary refers to your primary relationship.

24
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,680
If you're in an open relationship, let's actually use a noteworthy example this time.

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,160
Let's use Destiny and Mileena.

26
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,500
The Destiny-Mileena relationship is the primary, and whoever each of them date or fuck around

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,600
with on the side are the secondaries.

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,120
The relationship escalator refers to outward markers of commitment.

29
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,280
So getting a girl, being exclusive, living together, getting married, having kids together.

30
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,400
That's ascending the relationship escalator.

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,280
You have clear, visible markers of relationship progress, and you can tangibly see the commitment

32
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,560
they have to each other.

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,840
When this image says that a person is their own primary, that means the most important

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,500
relationship they have is with themselves.

35
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,680
When the image says that they're in multiple polydynamics and value them all, that means

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,400
that they're the lynchpin that holds several polydynamics into an actual polycule.

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,680
And damn, these maps really could double as an STD transmission path.

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,180
And when the image says that they don't depend on the relationship escalator, that means

39
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,780
that you can't judge their commitment to their relationships based on whether or not they

40
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,400
live together or get married or have kids or be exclusive or do any of the actual things

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,680
that people in committed relationships do.

42
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,800
In other words, it's a bunch of self-centered nonsense.

43
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,240
Also, it's a BIPOC hijabi woman with a hook for a leg.

44
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
Because why not?

45
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,960
I'm sure this person's out there slotting it up with everybody.

46
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,320
But what I noticed while looking at this is that inclusive, woke language reads a lot

47
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,400
like aristocratic language of the past.

48
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,040
It's like the old Russian aristocrats speaking French, or the church teaching in Latin.

49
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
It's the language of the elite.

50
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,280
Actually, I didn't notice it.

51
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
V noticed it.

52
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,920
But since he steals everything else, I'm going to steal this from him.

53
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,320
Normal people don't understand what inclusive language is, just like Russian peasants didn't

54
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,720
understand French, and in some way, just like uneducated people don't understand highly

55
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,420
scientific language either.

56
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,980
That lack of knowledge means that to the listener, the language sounds like it carries more weight

57
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,980
than it actually does.

58
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,980
Think about it.

59
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,860
If you go to the doctors and the doctor diagnoses you with something, he's going to use layman

60
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,020
terms so that you know what's actually going on.

61
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,200
He could be more precise by using scientifically loaded language, but that precision would

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,260
be entirely lost on you unless you're also a doctor.

63
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,480
Just as a priest or a nobleman could use his knowledge of Latin and the Bible to chastise

64
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,380
the dirty, unwashed peasants who have no idea what he's talking about, a scientist or a

65
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,700
doctor or an academic can wield the knowledge of his own specialized language to do the

66
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,700
same.

67
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,900
It's not a different language in this case, but a person not in the know will hear these

68
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,060
complicated terms and think, I don't get it, but it sounds like he knows what he's

69
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,780
talking about, so he's probably right.

70
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,000
This is what is going on with the Pronouns Wiki and anything else that is a product of

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,620
woke gender studies courses on campus.

72
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,660
If they can build up a department of accredited professors teaching accredited texts at accredited

73
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,180
universities, then what makes them any different from any other domain of knowledge?

74
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,960
The computer science department has its texts and its classes and its teachers and its knowledge,

75
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,180
the engineering department has theirs, and the gender studies department has theirs.

76
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,540
The rubber stamp of the school gives them legitimacy, and that legitimacy is what they

77
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,020
wield in their political control of language.

78
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,420
Here is a great example.

79
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,940
What do you think this means?

80
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,480
We are poised to emerge as an influential champion of museological change as we advance

81
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,200
our capacity to foster and relay intersectional connections across disciplines and communities

82
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,060
that converge when a public, university-affiliated museum is both civically-minded and pedagogically

83
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,060
driven.

84
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,660
This is the announcement that a museum at Queen's University is being renovated.

85
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,260
Do you think anybody outside of academia understood that?

86
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,620
Most normal people consider the word racism to mean discrimination based on race, but

87
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,420
if you were to bring that definition to a progressive, they would say something like

88
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:34,360
lol read a book, white people can't be racist, it's privilege plus power, educate yourself.

89
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,340
The obvious normally reply to that is that's just an imposition by the academy on regular

90
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,340
people.

91
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,940
Most people don't think like that, it's not a real definition, which is true, but an equally

92
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,260
true statement will be the progressive reply.

93
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,060
Nothing is a real definition because we all made it up, and all new knowledge is ultimately

94
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,540
codified by the academy before it enters the mainstream.

95
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,980
The issue is, of course, they've corrupted this process of codification.

96
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,080
And to appeal to that overquoted book in 1984, if you can control the language, you can control

97
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,080
the thoughts.

98
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,740
How do you express an opinion when you have no word to describe it?

99
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,760
Yes, they literally do this, and yes, they literally talk about doing it.

100
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,980
You don't think you're racist?

101
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,040
New definitions will open your eyes, oh boy, I can't wait to see what new definitions await

102
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
me.

103
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,840
Things that don't fit into the traditional definition of racism, but may still contribute

104
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
to it.

105
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,380
Mixing up people who seem to be the same ethnicity, that's just a mistake.

106
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,740
Not bothering to learn an ethnic name, always mispronouncing it, calling them something

107
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,720
that's easier to pronounce, making a show of saying it, you know, sometimes it's just hard

108
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,140
to fucking do.

109
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,360
Touching a black person's hair, okay, fair enough, don't do that guys, don't just touch

110
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,960
someone's hair without their permission.

111
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,440
Asking easily searchable things to the only minority person in your vicinity, making assumptions

112
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,800
based on race, seeing racism in things that are not racist.

113
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,480
You do this all the fucking time.

114
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,760
Singing the n-word in songs, oh god, listen, if it's in a song, it's fine, that's my hard

115
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,040
stance on it at this point.

116
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,320
If someone's dropping slurs in a song, it is fine.

117
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,840
Being colorblind, that's literally the definition of anti-racism, you fucking morons.

118
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,560
Speaking over a person of color talking about racism, white prongs do that all the time,

119
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,560
bringing up an unrelated race topic when talking to a person of color.

120
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,440
Telling people you watched a minority led film multiple times, such as Black Panther,

121
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,840
Crazy Rich Asians, or Get Out, man, this whole list sounds like an attack against progressives.

122
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,760
I guess everything's racist, oh wait, it is.

123
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,380
Using an example of a famous person of color, deny how racist something is.

124
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,400
Blackface or cultural appropriation, where you borrow cultural items as a costume, hey

125
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,800
Justin Trudeau, you're fucked.

126
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,420
Denying or being defensive when confronted with the idea of racism.

127
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,680
So if you think you're not guilty of being racist, that's racist.

128
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,380
Bringing up someone's race when it's not relevant, that's literally being colorblind, you fucking

129
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,380
moron.

130
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,280
Referring to the race card, can't have jokes either.

131
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,100
Not believing that people of color contribute to society.

132
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,580
Covering up racism as opinion or freedom of speech, you know, something can be both free

133
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,740
speech and racist.

134
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,140
Asking for evidence when a person of color explains their lived experience.

135
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,700
That's the thing, here is some of that academic knowledge twisted for political gain.

136
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,820
They'll call it lived experience here, but if you try to bring it up, they'll call

137
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,180
it anecdotal.

138
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,860
Telling someone they're racist for bringing up race.

139
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,520
I swear to god half of these things are in direct conflict with the other half.

140
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,140
Thinking you're privy to racial struggles because you've had diverse members in your

141
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,580
family or social groups.

142
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,420
Yep, I guess I fucked an Asian no longer works.

143
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,180
Florissant woman helps change Merriam-Webster's definition of racism.

144
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,460
Because if we can change the dictionary, then our opponents can no longer appeal to it.

145
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,860
And we can instead.

146
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,900
Racism is a tough little word, the definition has grown and shifted over time.

147
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,180
No, people with political motives have pushed changes over time.

148
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,860
It's not hard to find studies published by reputable schools and outlets talking about

149
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,740
how language should be changed and used, and it's no surprise that it all leans one

150
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,740
way politically.

151
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,740
Here's the rub.

152
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,300
After the change has been pushed hard enough that it sticks in academic circles, it begins

153
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,740
to trickle down off campus.

154
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,660
It's like the priest speaking in Latin, and Normie's not going to know what's

155
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,100
going on, he's going to see, oh this study from this university says this is the proper

156
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,340
language for this idea, and the dictionary agrees with them, and then that'll be that.

157
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,820
NASA reexamining nicknames for cosmic objects.

158
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,600
Twitter and Microsoft changing up computer related terminology.

159
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,240
Urban dictionary declaring that articles that were once allowed and submitted back

160
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,920
when the internet was still a fun place are now problematic.

161
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,280
It all stems from the same attitude.

162
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
These words are offensive.

163
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Oh, they're not offensive?

164
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Well, guess what?

165
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,800
I changed the definition, so now they are.

166
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,120
Heh heh, you're a racist now.

167
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
Go to college.

168
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,720
And even when you're right, you're still wrong.

169
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,720
Take the case of Martin O'Neill in Ireland, who was raked over the coals for his use of

170
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
the word queer.

171
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,520
A word that was a slur decades ago, but has since been reclaimed by the community.

172
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,520
The hit piece written about the Irish football coach specifically references the LGBTI community

173
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,400
as being the aggrieved party.

174
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Not the LGBTQ community, because the Q stands for queer, a word they already used to describe

175
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
themselves.

176
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,600
LGBTI was in use back when queer was still considered a slur.

177
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,640
LGBTI stopped being used decades ago, and the Q replaced the I when queer stopped being

178
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
a slur.

179
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,320
This is all done for political reasons.

180
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,640
It's done so that leftoids may build power and attack their enemies.

181
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,440
If you want the most blatant example of it, look no further than the shit show surrounding

182
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,880
then Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett in October of 2020.

183
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,960
Just in case you weren't plugged into the social media sphere back then, let me describe

184
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
it to you.

185
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
I was there.

186
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,280
I was jacked right the fuck in and watched the spin cycle happen in real time.

187
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,840
She said live on camera that she would not judge people based on sexual preference.

188
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,720
That you, like him, would be a consistent vote to roll back hard fought freedoms and

189
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,520
protections for the LGBT community.

190
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,980
And what I was hoping you would say is that this would be a point of difference where

191
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,540
those freedoms would be respected.

192
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,040
And you haven't said that.

193
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:46,600
Senator, I have no agenda and I do want to be clear that I have never discriminated on

194
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,940
the basis of sexual preference and would not ever discriminate on the basis of sexual

195
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,940
preference.

196
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,680
You know, like racism, I think discrimination is abhorrent.

197
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,420
This was during the morning session of her confirmation to the Supreme Court, but leftoids

198
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,560
on Twitter latched onto that phrase, sexual preference, deciding it was problematic.

199
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,800
And soon after, articles were published by various news outlets, all decrying Amy Coney

200
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,400
Barrett for using the hateful slur, sexual preference.

201
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,720
But each and every single one of them, the outlets and the verified Twitter accounts

202
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,720
used that same term positively in the past.

203
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,760
By the afternoon session of the confirmation, a Democratic Senator was grilling Amy Coney

204
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,640
Barrett using talking points she pulled from online.

205
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:34,360
Not once, but twice, you use the term sexual preference to describe those in the LGBT community.

206
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,520
And let me make clear, sexual preference is an offensive and outdated term.

207
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:47,980
It is used by anti-LGBTQ activists to suggest that sexual orientation is a choice.

208
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,240
It is not.

209
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,080
Sexual orientation is a key part of a person's identity.

210
00:10:53,080 --> 00:11:00,680
That sexual orientation is both a normal expression of human sexuality and immutable was a key

211
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:06,700
part of the majority's opinion in Obergefell, which by the way, Scalia did not agree with.

212
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,320
So in saying that I couldn't opine on whether Obergefell was rightly decided or not, I was

213
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,140
certainly not indicating disagreement with it.

214
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:19,260
The point of not answering was to simply say it's inappropriate for me to say a response.

215
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:25,220
And the second point was to say that I certainly didn't mean and would never mean to use a

216
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,220
term that would cause any offense in the LGBTQ community.

217
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,020
So if I did, I greatly apologize for that.

218
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,940
I simply meant to be referring to Obergefell's holding with respect to same-sex marriage.

219
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,460
By the end of the day, the dictionary had changed its definition of sexual preference

220
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,060
to make it an offensive remark.

221
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,920
The manipulation and redefinition of language, acts that are only legitimized by the authority

222
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,180
of the offices of the people doing the corruption, has become so efficient that a completely

223
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:55,060
normal term can be rendered unspeakable within the span of a 24-hour news cycle.

224
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,820
And this process has only continued at a breakneck pace.

225
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,340
This is actually some war is peace, freedom is slavery shit.

226
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,540
The assault on language in the name of inclusivity, using the authority of the academic institution

227
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,140
as a justification, is actually about making language so imprecise that regular people

228
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,100
can no longer use it to speak truth.

229
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,100
They're no longer illegal immigrants, they're undocumented migrants.

230
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,380
It's not a riot, it's a mostly peaceful protest.

231
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,680
Alternatively, it's not a riot, it's a violent overthrow of the government.

232
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,740
Each of these changes is less precise, but they're also longer and clunkier to speak

233
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,740
and write.

234
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,460
It seems to me that the people enforcing the change find the subject inconvenient, either

235
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,940
personally or politically.

236
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,540
And so anybody who actually wants to speak the truth, end up having to speak longer and

237
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,860
clunkier sentences, and therefore less effective speech.

238
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,700
It's often said that the left can't meme.

239
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,940
That's not necessarily true.

240
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,260
What's actually happening is, the Prague viewpoints rely on this carefully constructed

241
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,420
version of reality, which naturally doesn't lend itself to easily conveyed messages.

242
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,800
If the normies see things as they are, without a leftoid providing several layers of carefully

243
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,440
selected context, they'll interpret reality in a way detrimental to their political goals.

244
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,520
In other words, the left can't meme because memes are the antithesis of how they communicate.

245
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,020
Memes are intuitive, not rational.

246
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,800
If you have to rationally explain a joke, it ceases to be funny.

247
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,520
There's a reason these conversations always go the same way.

248
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,040
The Prague always begins by saying, we need to have a conversation about this, which is

249
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,880
never actually a conversation, it's just you listening to them.

250
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,040
And then they're going to say that they're on the right side of history, and they're

251
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,000
just going to speak the truth, and the personal is political, and they're just doing praxis.

252
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,060
If you object, then you're on the wrong side of history.

253
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,300
You're taking up space, and you need to educate yourself and check your privilege.

254
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,960
If they get angry during the conversation, they will claim that anger is righteousness.

255
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,280
It's the language of the unheard.

256
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,980
If you get angry, it's male tears and white fragility.

257
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,360
If you ask them to explain their points, they will say they don't owe you their time or

258
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
their emotional labor.

259
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,580
But if you try to explain yours, you'll be told that you're mansplaining, or you're

260
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,660
a class traitor, or you're a bootlicker.

261
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,020
Each of these terms is opaque to every normie my age.

262
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,740
Most of them didn't take gender studies classes.

263
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,060
So they just think, oh, geez, I must have done something wrong.

264
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,320
I don't want to bother anybody.

265
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
And then they comply.

266
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Fair enough.

267
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,920
Most feel good about making other people feel bad for no reason.

268
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,720
But these people exploit that natural tendency of goodwill and subvert it for their own political

269
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,420
agenda, using the tools of over-educated language to do the job.

270
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,460
Best counter to this is blanket refusal.

271
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,520
Don't apologize unless your conscience tells you you've done something wrong.

272
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,400
Certainly don't apologize to get a mob to stop coming after you, because they never

273
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
will.

274
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,280
Don't acquiesce to their redefinitions of terms.

275
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,660
Call a spade a spade.

276
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,340
If they're racist, call them racist.

277
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,500
And when they whine, you can't be racist towards white people.

278
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,420
Just roar back, shut up, bitch, you're a fucking racist.

279
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,920
The Chad meme is so effective in this conversation, because it strikes at a core truth, that people

280
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,540
still know what the score is, regardless of the institutions leading an assault on their

281
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,800
body of knowledge, and that a true individualist position is to simply say no.

282
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,760
I know you've subverted the schools and the news outlets and the dictionaries.

283
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,080
I know what the truth is, and you're wrong, no matter how many mouthpieces you corrupt.

284
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,100
They are petty tyrants who only have the power of words at the end of the day, so you must

285
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,280
use yours and say no.
