0	9760	When I was writing the script for yesterday's video, the Pronouns and Bio one, I realized
9760	11080	something about the Pronouns Wiki.
11080	14960	Yeah, it was pretty fun to go down rabbit holes and see all of the weird terms they've
14960	18040	invented for concepts that don't really exist, but it's more than that.
18040	22520	Normies who are a lot less plugged into things who come across this wiki would be utterly
22520	23520	bamboozled.
23520	25300	Nobody's going to understand this shit.
25300	29560	An image made the rounds on social media recently that made me think the same thing.
29560	30560	Check this out.
30560	32480	What is solo poly?
32480	35940	Sole polyamory is a type of polyamorous configuration.
35940	40740	Solo poly people tend to see their selves as their own primary.
40740	44780	They usually have multiple separate or intertwined polyamorous dynamics.
44780	46920	They are committed to their polyamorous relationships.
46920	50440	They don't depend on the relationship escalator to express their commitment.
50440	52640	Well, what the fuck does this all mean?
52640	53640	Polyamory is pretty obvious.
53640	56780	It's when you have a committed relationship with more than one other person, as opposed
56780	60620	to an open relationship, which is when you're romantically committed to one person, but
60620	62940	you're both fucking other people separately.
62940	67120	Or a polycule, which is the extended connections and chains of relationships between people
67120	68620	who are non-exclusive.
68620	72780	A primary in this vocabulary refers to your primary relationship.
72780	76680	If you're in an open relationship, let's actually use a noteworthy example this time.
76680	78160	Let's use Destiny and Mileena.
78160	82500	The Destiny-Mileena relationship is the primary, and whoever each of them date or fuck around
82500	84600	with on the side are the secondaries.
84600	88120	The relationship escalator refers to outward markers of commitment.
88120	92280	So getting a girl, being exclusive, living together, getting married, having kids together.
92280	94400	That's ascending the relationship escalator.
94400	99280	You have clear, visible markers of relationship progress, and you can tangibly see the commitment
99280	100560	they have to each other.
100560	104840	When this image says that a person is their own primary, that means the most important
104840	107500	relationship they have is with themselves.
107500	111680	When the image says that they're in multiple polydynamics and value them all, that means
111680	116400	that they're the lynchpin that holds several polydynamics into an actual polycule.
116400	120680	And damn, these maps really could double as an STD transmission path.
120680	124180	And when the image says that they don't depend on the relationship escalator, that means
124180	127780	that you can't judge their commitment to their relationships based on whether or not they
127780	132400	live together or get married or have kids or be exclusive or do any of the actual things
132400	134680	that people in committed relationships do.
134680	136800	In other words, it's a bunch of self-centered nonsense.
136800	140240	Also, it's a BIPOC hijabi woman with a hook for a leg.
140240	141240	Because why not?
141240	143960	I'm sure this person's out there slotting it up with everybody.
143960	148320	But what I noticed while looking at this is that inclusive, woke language reads a lot
148320	150400	like aristocratic language of the past.
150400	154040	It's like the old Russian aristocrats speaking French, or the church teaching in Latin.
154040	155040	It's the language of the elite.
155040	156280	Actually, I didn't notice it.
156280	157280	V noticed it.
157280	159920	But since he steals everything else, I'm going to steal this from him.
159920	163320	Normal people don't understand what inclusive language is, just like Russian peasants didn't
163320	167720	understand French, and in some way, just like uneducated people don't understand highly
167720	169420	scientific language either.
169640	173980	That lack of knowledge means that to the listener, the language sounds like it carries more weight
173980	174980	than it actually does.
174980	175980	Think about it.
175980	178860	If you go to the doctors and the doctor diagnoses you with something, he's going to use layman
178860	181020	terms so that you know what's actually going on.
181020	185200	He could be more precise by using scientifically loaded language, but that precision would
185200	188260	be entirely lost on you unless you're also a doctor.
188260	192480	Just as a priest or a nobleman could use his knowledge of Latin and the Bible to chastise
192480	196380	the dirty, unwashed peasants who have no idea what he's talking about, a scientist or a
196380	200700	doctor or an academic can wield the knowledge of his own specialized language to do the
200700	201700	same.
201700	204900	It's not a different language in this case, but a person not in the know will hear these
204900	208060	complicated terms and think, I don't get it, but it sounds like he knows what he's
208060	209780	talking about, so he's probably right.
209780	213000	This is what is going on with the Pronouns Wiki and anything else that is a product of
213000	215620	woke gender studies courses on campus.
215620	219660	If they can build up a department of accredited professors teaching accredited texts at accredited
219660	223180	universities, then what makes them any different from any other domain of knowledge?
223180	226960	The computer science department has its texts and its classes and its teachers and its knowledge,
226960	230180	the engineering department has theirs, and the gender studies department has theirs.
230180	233540	The rubber stamp of the school gives them legitimacy, and that legitimacy is what they
233540	236020	wield in their political control of language.
236020	237420	Here is a great example.
237420	238940	What do you think this means?
238940	243480	We are poised to emerge as an influential champion of museological change as we advance
243480	248200	our capacity to foster and relay intersectional connections across disciplines and communities
248200	253060	that converge when a public, university-affiliated museum is both civically-minded and pedagogically
253060	254060	driven.
254060	258660	This is the announcement that a museum at Queen's University is being renovated.
258660	262260	Do you think anybody outside of academia understood that?
262260	266620	Most normal people consider the word racism to mean discrimination based on race, but
266620	269420	if you were to bring that definition to a progressive, they would say something like
269420	274360	lol read a book, white people can't be racist, it's privilege plus power, educate yourself.
274360	278340	The obvious normally reply to that is that's just an imposition by the academy on regular
278340	279340	people.
279340	282940	Most people don't think like that, it's not a real definition, which is true, but an equally
282940	285260	true statement will be the progressive reply.
285260	289060	Nothing is a real definition because we all made it up, and all new knowledge is ultimately
289060	291540	codified by the academy before it enters the mainstream.
291540	294980	The issue is, of course, they've corrupted this process of codification.
294980	299080	And to appeal to that overquoted book in 1984, if you can control the language, you can control
299080	300080	the thoughts.
300080	302740	How do you express an opinion when you have no word to describe it?
302740	306760	Yes, they literally do this, and yes, they literally talk about doing it.
306760	307980	You don't think you're racist?
307980	312040	New definitions will open your eyes, oh boy, I can't wait to see what new definitions await
312040	313040	me.
313040	315840	Things that don't fit into the traditional definition of racism, but may still contribute
315840	316840	to it.
316840	319380	Mixing up people who seem to be the same ethnicity, that's just a mistake.
319380	322740	Not bothering to learn an ethnic name, always mispronouncing it, calling them something
322740	326720	that's easier to pronounce, making a show of saying it, you know, sometimes it's just hard
326720	328140	to fucking do.
328140	331360	Touching a black person's hair, okay, fair enough, don't do that guys, don't just touch
331360	332960	someone's hair without their permission.
332960	337440	Asking easily searchable things to the only minority person in your vicinity, making assumptions
337440	340800	based on race, seeing racism in things that are not racist.
340800	342480	You do this all the fucking time.
342480	347760	Singing the n-word in songs, oh god, listen, if it's in a song, it's fine, that's my hard
347760	349040	stance on it at this point.
349040	352320	If someone's dropping slurs in a song, it is fine.
352320	355840	Being colorblind, that's literally the definition of anti-racism, you fucking morons.
355840	361560	Speaking over a person of color talking about racism, white prongs do that all the time,
361560	364560	bringing up an unrelated race topic when talking to a person of color.
364560	368440	Telling people you watched a minority led film multiple times, such as Black Panther,
368440	372840	Crazy Rich Asians, or Get Out, man, this whole list sounds like an attack against progressives.
372840	375760	I guess everything's racist, oh wait, it is.
375760	379380	Using an example of a famous person of color, deny how racist something is.
379380	383400	Blackface or cultural appropriation, where you borrow cultural items as a costume, hey
383400	385800	Justin Trudeau, you're fucked.
385800	389420	Denying or being defensive when confronted with the idea of racism.
389420	393680	So if you think you're not guilty of being racist, that's racist.
393680	398380	Bringing up someone's race when it's not relevant, that's literally being colorblind, you fucking
398380	399380	moron.
399380	402280	Referring to the race card, can't have jokes either.
402280	405100	Not believing that people of color contribute to society.
405100	409580	Covering up racism as opinion or freedom of speech, you know, something can be both free
409580	410740	speech and racist.
410740	414140	Asking for evidence when a person of color explains their lived experience.
414140	418700	That's the thing, here is some of that academic knowledge twisted for political gain.
418700	422820	They'll call it lived experience here, but if you try to bring it up, they'll call
422820	424180	it anecdotal.
424180	426860	Telling someone they're racist for bringing up race.
426860	430520	I swear to god half of these things are in direct conflict with the other half.
430520	434140	Thinking you're privy to racial struggles because you've had diverse members in your
434140	435580	family or social groups.
435580	438420	Yep, I guess I fucked an Asian no longer works.
438420	442180	Florissant woman helps change Merriam-Webster's definition of racism.
442180	445460	Because if we can change the dictionary, then our opponents can no longer appeal to it.
445460	446860	And we can instead.
446860	449900	Racism is a tough little word, the definition has grown and shifted over time.
449900	453180	No, people with political motives have pushed changes over time.
453180	456860	It's not hard to find studies published by reputable schools and outlets talking about
456860	460740	how language should be changed and used, and it's no surprise that it all leans one
460740	461740	way politically.
461740	462740	Here's the rub.
462740	466300	After the change has been pushed hard enough that it sticks in academic circles, it begins
466300	467740	to trickle down off campus.
467740	470660	It's like the priest speaking in Latin, and Normie's not going to know what's
470660	474100	going on, he's going to see, oh this study from this university says this is the proper
474100	477340	language for this idea, and the dictionary agrees with them, and then that'll be that.
477340	479820	NASA reexamining nicknames for cosmic objects.
479820	482600	Twitter and Microsoft changing up computer related terminology.
482600	486240	Urban dictionary declaring that articles that were once allowed and submitted back
486240	488920	when the internet was still a fun place are now problematic.
488920	491280	It all stems from the same attitude.
491280	492280	These words are offensive.
492280	493280	Oh, they're not offensive?
493280	494280	Well, guess what?
494280	495800	I changed the definition, so now they are.
495800	497120	Heh heh, you're a racist now.
497120	498120	Go to college.
498120	499720	And even when you're right, you're still wrong.
499720	503720	Take the case of Martin O'Neill in Ireland, who was raked over the coals for his use of
503720	504720	the word queer.
504720	508520	A word that was a slur decades ago, but has since been reclaimed by the community.
508520	513520	The hit piece written about the Irish football coach specifically references the LGBTI community
513520	515400	as being the aggrieved party.
515400	521400	Not the LGBTQ community, because the Q stands for queer, a word they already used to describe
521400	522400	themselves.
522400	526600	LGBTI was in use back when queer was still considered a slur.
526600	532640	LGBTI stopped being used decades ago, and the Q replaced the I when queer stopped being
532640	533640	a slur.
533640	535320	This is all done for political reasons.
535320	538640	It's done so that leftoids may build power and attack their enemies.
538640	542440	If you want the most blatant example of it, look no further than the shit show surrounding
542440	546880	then Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett in October of 2020.
546880	549960	Just in case you weren't plugged into the social media sphere back then, let me describe
549960	550960	it to you.
550960	551960	I was there.
551960	554280	I was jacked right the fuck in and watched the spin cycle happen in real time.
554280	558840	She said live on camera that she would not judge people based on sexual preference.
558840	564720	That you, like him, would be a consistent vote to roll back hard fought freedoms and
564720	568520	protections for the LGBT community.
568520	573980	And what I was hoping you would say is that this would be a point of difference where
573980	577540	those freedoms would be respected.
577540	580040	And you haven't said that.
580040	586600	Senator, I have no agenda and I do want to be clear that I have never discriminated on
586600	590940	the basis of sexual preference and would not ever discriminate on the basis of sexual
590940	591940	preference.
591940	595680	You know, like racism, I think discrimination is abhorrent.
595680	599420	This was during the morning session of her confirmation to the Supreme Court, but leftoids
599420	603560	on Twitter latched onto that phrase, sexual preference, deciding it was problematic.
603560	607800	And soon after, articles were published by various news outlets, all decrying Amy Coney
607800	611400	Barrett for using the hateful slur, sexual preference.
611400	614720	But each and every single one of them, the outlets and the verified Twitter accounts
614720	617720	used that same term positively in the past.
617720	621760	By the afternoon session of the confirmation, a Democratic Senator was grilling Amy Coney
621760	624640	Barrett using talking points she pulled from online.
624640	634360	Not once, but twice, you use the term sexual preference to describe those in the LGBT community.
634360	640520	And let me make clear, sexual preference is an offensive and outdated term.
640520	647980	It is used by anti-LGBTQ activists to suggest that sexual orientation is a choice.
647980	649240	It is not.
649240	653080	Sexual orientation is a key part of a person's identity.
653080	660680	That sexual orientation is both a normal expression of human sexuality and immutable was a key
660680	666700	part of the majority's opinion in Obergefell, which by the way, Scalia did not agree with.
666700	671320	So in saying that I couldn't opine on whether Obergefell was rightly decided or not, I was
671320	674140	certainly not indicating disagreement with it.
674140	679260	The point of not answering was to simply say it's inappropriate for me to say a response.
679260	685220	And the second point was to say that I certainly didn't mean and would never mean to use a
685220	689220	term that would cause any offense in the LGBTQ community.
689220	692020	So if I did, I greatly apologize for that.
692020	696940	I simply meant to be referring to Obergefell's holding with respect to same-sex marriage.
696940	700460	By the end of the day, the dictionary had changed its definition of sexual preference
700460	702060	to make it an offensive remark.
702060	705920	The manipulation and redefinition of language, acts that are only legitimized by the authority
705920	710180	of the offices of the people doing the corruption, has become so efficient that a completely
710180	715060	normal term can be rendered unspeakable within the span of a 24-hour news cycle.
715060	717820	And this process has only continued at a breakneck pace.
717820	721340	This is actually some war is peace, freedom is slavery shit.
721380	725540	The assault on language in the name of inclusivity, using the authority of the academic institution
725540	730140	as a justification, is actually about making language so imprecise that regular people
730140	732100	can no longer use it to speak truth.
732100	735100	They're no longer illegal immigrants, they're undocumented migrants.
735100	737380	It's not a riot, it's a mostly peaceful protest.
737380	740680	Alternatively, it's not a riot, it's a violent overthrow of the government.
740680	744740	Each of these changes is less precise, but they're also longer and clunkier to speak
744740	745740	and write.
745740	749460	It seems to me that the people enforcing the change find the subject inconvenient, either
749460	750940	personally or politically.
750940	754540	And so anybody who actually wants to speak the truth, end up having to speak longer and
754540	757860	clunkier sentences, and therefore less effective speech.
757860	759700	It's often said that the left can't meme.
759700	760940	That's not necessarily true.
760940	764260	What's actually happening is, the Prague viewpoints rely on this carefully constructed
764260	768420	version of reality, which naturally doesn't lend itself to easily conveyed messages.
768420	772800	If the normies see things as they are, without a leftoid providing several layers of carefully
772800	777440	selected context, they'll interpret reality in a way detrimental to their political goals.
777440	781520	In other words, the left can't meme because memes are the antithesis of how they communicate.
781520	783020	Memes are intuitive, not rational.
783020	785800	If you have to rationally explain a joke, it ceases to be funny.
785800	788520	There's a reason these conversations always go the same way.
788520	792040	The Prague always begins by saying, we need to have a conversation about this, which is
792040	794880	never actually a conversation, it's just you listening to them.
794880	797040	And then they're going to say that they're on the right side of history, and they're
797040	801000	just going to speak the truth, and the personal is political, and they're just doing praxis.
801000	803060	If you object, then you're on the wrong side of history.
803060	806300	You're taking up space, and you need to educate yourself and check your privilege.
806300	809960	If they get angry during the conversation, they will claim that anger is righteousness.
809960	811280	It's the language of the unheard.
811280	813980	If you get angry, it's male tears and white fragility.
813980	817360	If you ask them to explain their points, they will say they don't owe you their time or
817360	818360	their emotional labor.
818360	821580	But if you try to explain yours, you'll be told that you're mansplaining, or you're
821580	823660	a class traitor, or you're a bootlicker.
823660	827020	Each of these terms is opaque to every normie my age.
827020	828740	Most of them didn't take gender studies classes.
828740	831060	So they just think, oh, geez, I must have done something wrong.
831060	832320	I don't want to bother anybody.
832320	833320	And then they comply.
833320	834320	Fair enough.
834320	836920	Most feel good about making other people feel bad for no reason.
836920	841720	But these people exploit that natural tendency of goodwill and subvert it for their own political
841720	845420	agenda, using the tools of over-educated language to do the job.
845420	847460	Best counter to this is blanket refusal.
