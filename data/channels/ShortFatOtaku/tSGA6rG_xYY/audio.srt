Hey guys, no full video today, partially because yesterday's video kind of took a lot out of me,

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,160
I don't know if you noticed, but also because D&D is happening pretty soon, and I'm getting ready

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,040
for that, and after D&D I'm going to be streaming some Donkey Kong 64, so I already kind of have a

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,600
full day planned ahead of me. Speaking of streaming, I'm sure some of you guys have noticed

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,400
that PewDiePie has decided to prop up DLive as a Twitch alternative, mainly because it's

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,600
blockchain-based, and I do think that this is an incredible opportunity, so usually I stream on

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,240
this Twitch channel, Game Boomers. What I'm going to do this time around is I'm going to stream on

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:51,840
my new Game Boomers DLive, so that's dlive.tv slash Game Boomers. Oh look, Odin just followed,

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:02,240
gay. Thanks, Odin. Anyway, I do want to support anything that smashes the current tech oligarchies,

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:09,520
so I'm going to give DLive a try for my game streaming around seven o'clock PM EST.

11
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,560
Hope to see you there. I love you.
