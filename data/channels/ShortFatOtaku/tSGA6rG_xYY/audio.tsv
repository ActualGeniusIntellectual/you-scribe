0	6640	Hey guys, no full video today, partially because yesterday's video kind of took a lot out of me,
6640	12160	I don't know if you noticed, but also because D&D is happening pretty soon, and I'm getting ready
12160	19040	for that, and after D&D I'm going to be streaming some Donkey Kong 64, so I already kind of have a
19040	23600	full day planned ahead of me. Speaking of streaming, I'm sure some of you guys have noticed
23600	30400	that PewDiePie has decided to prop up DLive as a Twitch alternative, mainly because it's
30400	35600	blockchain-based, and I do think that this is an incredible opportunity, so usually I stream on
35600	42240	this Twitch channel, Game Boomers. What I'm going to do this time around is I'm going to stream on
42240	51840	my new Game Boomers DLive, so that's dlive.tv slash Game Boomers. Oh look, Odin just followed,
51840	62240	gay. Thanks, Odin. Anyway, I do want to support anything that smashes the current tech oligarchies,
62240	69520	so I'm going to give DLive a try for my game streaming around seven o'clock PM EST.
70160	72560	Hope to see you there. I love you.
