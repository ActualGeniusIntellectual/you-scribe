Hey guys, no full video today, partially because yesterday's video kind of took a lot out of me,

00:06.640 --> 00:12.160
I don't know if you noticed, but also because D&D is happening pretty soon, and I'm getting ready

00:12.160 --> 00:19.040
for that, and after D&D I'm going to be streaming some Donkey Kong 64, so I already kind of have a

00:19.040 --> 00:23.600
full day planned ahead of me. Speaking of streaming, I'm sure some of you guys have noticed

00:23.600 --> 00:30.400
that PewDiePie has decided to prop up DLive as a Twitch alternative, mainly because it's

00:30.400 --> 00:35.600
blockchain-based, and I do think that this is an incredible opportunity, so usually I stream on

00:35.600 --> 00:42.240
this Twitch channel, Game Boomers. What I'm going to do this time around is I'm going to stream on

00:42.240 --> 00:51.840
my new Game Boomers DLive, so that's dlive.tv slash Game Boomers. Oh look, Odin just followed,

00:51.840 --> 01:02.240
gay. Thanks, Odin. Anyway, I do want to support anything that smashes the current tech oligarchies,

01:02.240 --> 01:09.520
so I'm going to give DLive a try for my game streaming around seven o'clock PM EST.

01:10.160 --> 01:12.560
Hope to see you there. I love you.
