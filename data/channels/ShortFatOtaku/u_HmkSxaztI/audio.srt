00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Good morning gamers! Let's talk about Corona-Chan, because after yesterday's video where I did

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,200
the whole hate facts thing, we need to be even more depressed about the state of the world.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,560
I see all you guys saying that I'm going to get yeeted off YouTube for that video,

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,080
maybe, but you know my channel is still pretty clean, no strikes or anything,

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,160
so I'm sure they'll at least give me one. It'll probably be okay. It's on Bitchute anyway,

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,440
so it's not going anywhere. I last looked at this map during the weekly sip,

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,160
and things have gotten worse since then. Another 200 cases in South Korea since Sunday.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,800
Italy's blown up. Japan's blown up. The US now has 35. Iran has gone crazy. There are

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,040
stories with Italy and Iran both, how the numbers just spiked in both of those places.

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,920
Canada's a tent, okay? I'm still fine. I still kind of live in an isolated area of Canada.

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,040
I don't even think SARS made it here, where I live, so this one might not make it here.

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,640
Hopefully, guys. Check out the bottom of the list. A bunch of these other countries now.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:07,680
Afghanistan, Nepal, Bahrain, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt, Sri Lanka now. These places all have at least one

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,760
case, which means that there's actually probably a lot more cases, like a lot more cases. Considering

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,920
that this thing takes two weeks to incubate, it can survive on surfaces for a long time,

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,440
there's definitely the chance that there's just a whole bunch of unreported cases everywhere.

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,960
South America's still pure. They'll be the last civilization.

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,360
I don't think this is gonna kill us, I'm just joking. Let's start with some fun stupidity

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,320
before I really get depressed about it. Coronavirus could lead to a US vape shortage,

20
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,080
because I guess it's all made in China. I do like this guy here, hikikomorphism's take on it.

21
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,880
This is a news article you find lying around in the early stages of a Deus Ex game. Yeah,

22
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,240
kinda. Or maybe like a Walking Dead or something, like some kind of zombie game,

23
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,240
where like before shit gets real you just see that Vice published something completely

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,960
fucking stupid. Check out these brainlets here. I guess I'm committed to Chinese food when we

25
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,560
go out until this thing is either over or normalized. Luckily that's not what you call a

26
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,800
problem. Yeah dude. I heard from my mom yesterday that some Chinese restaurants are saying that if

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,560
things go on like this for another week or two, they'll have to close. Check out your local Chinese

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,840
places if you can. No thank you. No thank you. You can call me a bigot if you like, but I will not

29
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,360
eat the bat soup. Pewdiepie came back, guys. And of course immediately when his first video

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,400
published, the media had something to say about it. Pewdiepie laughs at Coronavirus in a racially

31
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,560
edgy return video. Pewdiepie is back on YouTube again, and back to his old ways. In his return

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,520
video he laughs about the Coronavirus and mocks the Chinese language. You know, when there's

33
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:49,040
something as serious as this happening, you kinda do have to laugh at it. I don't know if, like,

34
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,000
are journalists human beings? This is a medical article, the 2019 NCOV Coronavirus, are there two

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
routes to infection? And the basic idea of the article is that it turns out that it's not just

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,760
through sneezing or coughing or breathing, you know, respiratory infection, that the Coronavirus

37
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,120
can get around. It can also be transmitted through fecal transmission. Apparently if you have the

38
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,640
Coronavirus and you have diarrhea, you can create a virus-laden gaseous plume, which can infect

39
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:28,960
other people up to 200 meters away. Damn, dude. This doesn't bode well for India. I'm sorry.

40
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,320
I'm sorry. Let's get to the actual news. Iran is closing all schools in its capital city of Tehran

41
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,520
because of the Coronavirus epidemic. Now that the Coronavirus has actually hit Iran, I think we're

42
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,720
going to start seeing a bit more of a serious death toll. Like, China is not the greatest

43
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,680
country medically or, like, technologically, but it's certainly light years ahead of a place like

44
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,360
Iran. And these other Middle Eastern places and African places, now they're going to start getting

45
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,920
infected. I think we're going to start seeing a lot of people die. I really do. I think in

46
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,120
these places where there is no real medical apparatus to speak of, nothing certainly advanced,

47
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,800
certainly nothing Western, there's going to be some serious problems regarding the Coronavirus.

48
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,800
This is not yet confirmed to be Coronavirus, but I think we're all thinking it.

49
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:19,920
The Slovak Prime Minister has canceled a schedule due to an illness. Just an illness. Who knows what

50
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,560
it is? I mean, it kind of sounds like if you read it. Slovak Prime Minister canceled his agenda

51
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,960
because of a sudden illness. He was hospitalized yesterday night due to acute upper respiratory

52
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,480
tract infection accompanied with high temperature. Due to his condition, he is canceling his entire

53
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:40,720
schedule temporarily. We're all thinking the same thing here, aren't we? What if this guy ends up

54
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,520
being like the first public figure to actually get the coronavirus? Another major location the

55
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,960
virus has hit since my last video was Italy. Italy is putting areas with outbreaks on lockdown.

56
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,200
Borders to Italy are closed. Additionally, they have no idea how the virus got there.

57
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,760
The man previously thought to be patient zero in Italy's outbreak has never actually had the virus.

58
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,960
It is now unknown how the outbreak began. Maybe this is like a walking dead scenario where

59
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,960
something fundamentally has changed in the human genome and all humans just have it.

60
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,720
Probably not, but it's interesting to think about. There's been some crazy video coming out of Milan

61
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,880
in Italy of just completely, God damn it, get out of here, Euro news, Jesus Christ, of just completely

62
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,640
empty store shelves because everyone is buying everything up. Like, let's keep going here. Look

63
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:35,280
at this. All this stuff is gone. It's just gone, man. People are raiding grocery stores in a panic

64
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,960
to buy whatever they can, you know? Remember that for the past three or four videos, I've been

65
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,040
saying start stockpiling some food. This is why. Everyone who thought I was dumb for saying it,

66
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,960
man, no. If it hits your town, this will happen. Grocery stores will run out. Shipping will slow

67
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,080
or even stop, at least temporarily. I've said it before. I'll say it again. Make sure that you have

68
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,720
enough food to last for like a month. If just for some reason you can't go outside for a month,

69
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,680
have food, have some rice, have some beans, have some peanut butter. There you go. Get a

70
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,240
multivitamin in there too. It's not going to taste any good, but it'll cover all of your nutritional

71
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,840
needs. You'll be set for like a month. 10 pound bag of rice, 10 pound bag of beans. Get a jumbo

72
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,640
container of peanut butter. Get it now while the stores are still open, while there's no panic,

73
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,800
and while there's no coronavirus in your city. Go get it now. You can even stop this video. I won't

74
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,040
even be offended. Just go out and get it. Xu Zengrun, who published a rare public critique

75
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:35,120
of President Xi Jinping over China's coronavirus crisis, has now been barred from social media,

76
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,440
and his friends have not been able to contact him for several days. The professor was confined to

77
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,080
his home by the Red Guard, and he has been barred from social media. This is China's new strategy.

78
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,640
When it first happened, they clamped down hard, just hoping that it would blow over like SARS did.

79
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,680
When it turned out that it wasn't blowing over, they had to at least be somewhat public about it,

80
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,560
but they had to start putting their own spin on it. They're like, okay, we're working on it.

81
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,840
We're getting under control. There was videos of people spraying the entire city with disinfectant,

82
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,560
et cetera, et cetera. But now that things have gone wildly out of control and it's

83
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,720
infecting the entire world, they've basically gone into complete lockdown mode again.

84
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,040
China's no longer reporting any new cases. They're no longer reporting any numbers.

85
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,360
Borders are closed. No information's getting in or out. We have no clue what's going on in

86
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,960
China anymore, and we haven't for at least a week. Zhu Xinyang and Li Kaochu, legal and social

87
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,200
activists in China, have gone missing. Of course they have. It's China. Finally, for once in their

88
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,160
miserable existence, at least recently, the New York Times is honest about something. To tame

89
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,040
coronavirus, Mao-style social control blankets China. Despite their high-tech tools, the

90
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,880
authorities are mainly relying on a flood of workers to keep hundreds of millions of people

91
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,960
from coming in contact with outsiders. This is how China has it under control, guys.

92
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,600
They're disinfecting like every surface of every city and just locking people away in their homes.

93
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,760
The last numbers that we got before China sealed itself off was 760 million people are

94
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,480
currently under quarantine. Not much of a fucking quarantine then, is it? I mentioned rather

95
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:12,160
flippantly last time, more as a joke, that the coronavirus could actually render men infertile.

96
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,520
Turns out that that was not necessarily just a rumor, there may actually be something to it.

97
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,920
Coronavirus seems like the perfect storm. Reports that it can affect fertility and cause men to not

98
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,600
be able to reproduce with their sperm. People are still saying this might be some kind of

99
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:29,200
bio-engineered weapon that got loose accidentally. I don't know, maybe. At this point, fucking

100
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:35,040
anything's possible. This is from the Global Times, which is basically China's media outlet

101
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,680
in the West. And if an arm of the Chinese government is finally admitting this, we have

102
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,400
to know there's something to it. New Chinese study indicates the coronavirus did not originate

103
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,520
in the Huanan seafood market. Yeah, we all know it came from the bio lab at this point,

104
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,600
don't we? They don't say where it came from, but they say that patient zero transmitted the virus

105
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,800
to workers or sellers at the market. It didn't originate at the market. The market just allowed

106
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,960
it to spread very quickly. Alongside Italy and Iran, the last place to have a massive boom

107
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:11,440
recently was South Korea. And guys, this story is so wild, I don't know if you will even believe me.

108
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,680
But first of all, let's start with almost all the patients in the South Korean psychiatric ward

109
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,200
have the coronavirus. It turns out it is being spread around medical facilities.

110
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:29,280
But more importantly, there is, believe it or not, an actual death cult from South Korea,

111
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,000
and they have actually succeeded in spreading this thing around. They've been flying on planes

112
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,040
for weeks to spread the virus around other nations. I'm not kidding. This is not something

113
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,600
out of a video game. Let me show you. This is from the Washington Post.

114
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:53,120
South Korean coronavirus spike linked to doomsday sect with a messianic leader. A church in South

115
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,400
Korea with a messianic leader has been identified as a hotbed of coronavirus cases as the outbreak

116
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,840
grows in parts of the country. The leader of the sect, Lee Man Hee, said all gatherings

117
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,200
have been suspended after health authorities linked Lee's followers to more than two-thirds

118
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,240
of all confirmed coronavirus cases in South Korea. Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

119
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,800
said that 182 of South Korea's confirmed coronavirus cases were traced to Lee's secretive

120
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,880
religious movement, called the Shin Cheonji Church of Jesus of the Temple of the Tabernacle

121
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,280
of the Testimony. A 61-year-old woman who attended the church's branch in the southern

122
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,560
city of Daegu has been identified as patient zero by health authorities. The woman initially

123
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,240
refused doctors' requests that she be tested for the virus on the grounds that she had not

124
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,480
traveled abroad recently. Before she eventually was tested, she visited a hotel, a hospital,

125
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,040
and the church attended by some 1,000 members. The KCDC director told reporters that the services

126
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,920
which often gather followers in crowded spaces possibly led to mass transmissions.

127
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,080
The church is thought to have more than 200,000 adherents across the country.

128
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,440
Followers equate Lee with the second coming of Jesus to deliver believers from an impending end

129
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,440
of days. And here's some of the related activities of this church. 28 of 39 South Koreans who

130
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,080
recently made a group pilgrimage to Israel have now tested positive for coronavirus.

131
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,280
That's probably how it got into Israel. Turns out that same church is well established in New

132
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:29,680
Zealand with branches in Auckland and Wellington. Oh well, it's been nice knowing you. It'll be

133
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,800
okay, dude. It'll be okay. The New York Times also had to talk about this shadowy church at

134
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,840
the center of the coronavirus outbreak. At the meetings of this secretive church,

135
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,560
worshippers sit and pack together on the floor, forbidden to wear glasses or face masks. They

136
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,200
come to church even when sick. After services, they split up into groups for Bible study,

137
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,360
where they go out into the streets and proselytize. After the first coronavirus

138
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,520
infection was reported among its members, they were told to lie about being followers.

139
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,720
As of Saturday, more than 700 members of the church, which is considered a cult,

140
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,320
could still not be reached according to health officials who were frantically hoping to screen

141
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,480
them for signs of infection. Oh my God, dude. When you actually look at the places this church has

142
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:19,120
branches all over the world, you can see it kind of, I don't want to say this, it kind of follows

143
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:27,840
the map of the spread of the infection. A lot of these places got this virus, not necessarily from

144
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:36,720
China, but from South Korea and Japan. So I wonder, I don't know, maybe it's best not to

145
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,040
be a conspiracy theorist about this. Some more stupidity from the World Health Organization,

146
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,360
if you happen to need any more proof that they're fucking incompetent.

147
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,720
The WHO says it no longer has a process to declare a pandemic because the old system used that had

148
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:56,000
six phases is no longer in use. Okay, so I guess they just can't declare things pandemics anymore.

149
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,080
Awesome. Meanwhile, here's the WHO's chief saying that the world must prepare for a potential

150
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:08,480
pandemic. How do you even know what a pandemic is? You fucking clown. This thread that this is

151
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,560
in is actually just full of like kind of crazy breaking news about it. Yeah. Stuff from Iran,

152
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,680
stuff from China, stuff from Italy. There's apparently a flight being held. Let's see if

153
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,880
I can find it here. Tourist hotspots in the Italian city of Milan are closing their doors.

154
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,560
Oman reports first two cases of the virus. An Air Italy flight from Rome is being held

155
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,280
in quarantine. I guess they just can't leave the plane. The WHO believes that the coronavirus has

156
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:41,360
peaked and plateaued in China. Are you actually trusting China's numbers on this? All right,

157
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,880
guys, things are going crazy out there. As always, I'll end it with this. At this point,

158
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,920
you probably can't prevent yourself from getting sick. If you're going to get sick,

159
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,160
you're going to get sick. At the same time, it doesn't seem to kill that many people,

160
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,280
two to 3%. That is a higher percentage than the flu, yes, but you can definitely fight this off

161
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,920
if you're smart about it. The biggest problem now is the breakdown of worldwide shipping and

162
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,520
the fact that if it comes to your town, your grocery stores might not be getting a resupply

163
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,720
for a while. Get your supplies now before it shows up. If you're in a place like Milan,

164
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,080
I hope you listened to me a couple weeks ago, and if you're in a place like my city where

165
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:20,400
nothing's happened yet, now's the time to prepare. Buy a few extra weeks worth of food that can be

166
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,520
stored at room temperature, just kept dry, and you can probably ride this one out. You don't

167
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,120
want to be going out into a riot just because you ran out of food. Though in my case, I could

168
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,000
probably stand to lose some weight anyway. Alright guys, good luck out there. Don't lose hope. I love you.
