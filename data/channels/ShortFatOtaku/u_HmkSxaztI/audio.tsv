0	6240	Good morning gamers! Let's talk about Corona-Chan, because after yesterday's video where I did
6240	11200	the whole hate facts thing, we need to be even more depressed about the state of the world.
11200	14560	I see all you guys saying that I'm going to get yeeted off YouTube for that video,
14560	18080	maybe, but you know my channel is still pretty clean, no strikes or anything,
18080	22160	so I'm sure they'll at least give me one. It'll probably be okay. It's on Bitchute anyway,
22160	25440	so it's not going anywhere. I last looked at this map during the weekly sip,
25920	32160	and things have gotten worse since then. Another 200 cases in South Korea since Sunday.
32800	38800	Italy's blown up. Japan's blown up. The US now has 35. Iran has gone crazy. There are
38800	43040	stories with Italy and Iran both, how the numbers just spiked in both of those places.
43680	49920	Canada's a tent, okay? I'm still fine. I still kind of live in an isolated area of Canada.
50640	55040	I don't even think SARS made it here, where I live, so this one might not make it here.
55040	58640	Hopefully, guys. Check out the bottom of the list. A bunch of these other countries now.
58640	67680	Afghanistan, Nepal, Bahrain, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt, Sri Lanka now. These places all have at least one
67680	73760	case, which means that there's actually probably a lot more cases, like a lot more cases. Considering
73760	77920	that this thing takes two weeks to incubate, it can survive on surfaces for a long time,
77920	83440	there's definitely the chance that there's just a whole bunch of unreported cases everywhere.
83520	86960	South America's still pure. They'll be the last civilization.
87920	91360	I don't think this is gonna kill us, I'm just joking. Let's start with some fun stupidity
91360	96320	before I really get depressed about it. Coronavirus could lead to a US vape shortage,
96320	102080	because I guess it's all made in China. I do like this guy here, hikikomorphism's take on it.
102080	106880	This is a news article you find lying around in the early stages of a Deus Ex game. Yeah,
106880	110240	kinda. Or maybe like a Walking Dead or something, like some kind of zombie game,
110240	114240	where like before shit gets real you just see that Vice published something completely
114240	118960	fucking stupid. Check out these brainlets here. I guess I'm committed to Chinese food when we
118960	122560	go out until this thing is either over or normalized. Luckily that's not what you call a
122560	128800	problem. Yeah dude. I heard from my mom yesterday that some Chinese restaurants are saying that if
128800	132560	things go on like this for another week or two, they'll have to close. Check out your local Chinese
132560	139840	places if you can. No thank you. No thank you. You can call me a bigot if you like, but I will not
139840	145360	eat the bat soup. Pewdiepie came back, guys. And of course immediately when his first video
145360	150400	published, the media had something to say about it. Pewdiepie laughs at Coronavirus in a racially
150400	156560	edgy return video. Pewdiepie is back on YouTube again, and back to his old ways. In his return
156560	161520	video he laughs about the Coronavirus and mocks the Chinese language. You know, when there's
161520	169040	something as serious as this happening, you kinda do have to laugh at it. I don't know if, like,
169040	176000	are journalists human beings? This is a medical article, the 2019 NCOV Coronavirus, are there two
176000	182000	routes to infection? And the basic idea of the article is that it turns out that it's not just
182000	187760	through sneezing or coughing or breathing, you know, respiratory infection, that the Coronavirus
187760	193120	can get around. It can also be transmitted through fecal transmission. Apparently if you have the
193120	200640	Coronavirus and you have diarrhea, you can create a virus-laden gaseous plume, which can infect
200640	208960	other people up to 200 meters away. Damn, dude. This doesn't bode well for India. I'm sorry.
208960	214320	I'm sorry. Let's get to the actual news. Iran is closing all schools in its capital city of Tehran
214320	219520	because of the Coronavirus epidemic. Now that the Coronavirus has actually hit Iran, I think we're
219520	224720	going to start seeing a bit more of a serious death toll. Like, China is not the greatest
224720	229680	country medically or, like, technologically, but it's certainly light years ahead of a place like
229680	233360	Iran. And these other Middle Eastern places and African places, now they're going to start getting
233360	237920	infected. I think we're going to start seeing a lot of people die. I really do. I think in
237920	243120	these places where there is no real medical apparatus to speak of, nothing certainly advanced,
243120	248800	certainly nothing Western, there's going to be some serious problems regarding the Coronavirus.
248800	252800	This is not yet confirmed to be Coronavirus, but I think we're all thinking it.
252800	259920	The Slovak Prime Minister has canceled a schedule due to an illness. Just an illness. Who knows what
259920	264560	it is? I mean, it kind of sounds like if you read it. Slovak Prime Minister canceled his agenda
264560	268960	because of a sudden illness. He was hospitalized yesterday night due to acute upper respiratory
268960	274480	tract infection accompanied with high temperature. Due to his condition, he is canceling his entire
274480	280720	schedule temporarily. We're all thinking the same thing here, aren't we? What if this guy ends up
280720	285520	being like the first public figure to actually get the coronavirus? Another major location the
285520	290960	virus has hit since my last video was Italy. Italy is putting areas with outbreaks on lockdown.
290960	295200	Borders to Italy are closed. Additionally, they have no idea how the virus got there.
295200	299760	The man previously thought to be patient zero in Italy's outbreak has never actually had the virus.
300320	304960	It is now unknown how the outbreak began. Maybe this is like a walking dead scenario where
304960	308960	something fundamentally has changed in the human genome and all humans just have it.
308960	314720	Probably not, but it's interesting to think about. There's been some crazy video coming out of Milan
314720	320880	in Italy of just completely, God damn it, get out of here, Euro news, Jesus Christ, of just completely
320880	326640	empty store shelves because everyone is buying everything up. Like, let's keep going here. Look
326640	335280	at this. All this stuff is gone. It's just gone, man. People are raiding grocery stores in a panic
335280	338960	to buy whatever they can, you know? Remember that for the past three or four videos, I've been
338960	345040	saying start stockpiling some food. This is why. Everyone who thought I was dumb for saying it,
345040	350960	man, no. If it hits your town, this will happen. Grocery stores will run out. Shipping will slow
350960	356080	or even stop, at least temporarily. I've said it before. I'll say it again. Make sure that you have
356080	360720	enough food to last for like a month. If just for some reason you can't go outside for a month,
360720	365680	have food, have some rice, have some beans, have some peanut butter. There you go. Get a
365680	370240	multivitamin in there too. It's not going to taste any good, but it'll cover all of your nutritional
370240	375840	needs. You'll be set for like a month. 10 pound bag of rice, 10 pound bag of beans. Get a jumbo
375840	380640	container of peanut butter. Get it now while the stores are still open, while there's no panic,
380640	384800	and while there's no coronavirus in your city. Go get it now. You can even stop this video. I won't
384800	389040	even be offended. Just go out and get it. Xu Zengrun, who published a rare public critique
389040	395120	of President Xi Jinping over China's coronavirus crisis, has now been barred from social media,
395120	399440	and his friends have not been able to contact him for several days. The professor was confined to
399440	404080	his home by the Red Guard, and he has been barred from social media. This is China's new strategy.
404720	410640	When it first happened, they clamped down hard, just hoping that it would blow over like SARS did.
410640	413680	When it turned out that it wasn't blowing over, they had to at least be somewhat public about it,
413680	416560	but they had to start putting their own spin on it. They're like, okay, we're working on it.
416560	421840	We're getting under control. There was videos of people spraying the entire city with disinfectant,
421840	426560	et cetera, et cetera. But now that things have gone wildly out of control and it's
426560	430720	infecting the entire world, they've basically gone into complete lockdown mode again.
430720	435040	China's no longer reporting any new cases. They're no longer reporting any numbers.
435040	439360	Borders are closed. No information's getting in or out. We have no clue what's going on in
439360	444960	China anymore, and we haven't for at least a week. Zhu Xinyang and Li Kaochu, legal and social
444960	451200	activists in China, have gone missing. Of course they have. It's China. Finally, for once in their
451200	456160	miserable existence, at least recently, the New York Times is honest about something. To tame
456160	461040	coronavirus, Mao-style social control blankets China. Despite their high-tech tools, the
461040	464880	authorities are mainly relying on a flood of workers to keep hundreds of millions of people
464880	468960	from coming in contact with outsiders. This is how China has it under control, guys.
470240	475600	They're disinfecting like every surface of every city and just locking people away in their homes.
475600	481760	The last numbers that we got before China sealed itself off was 760 million people are
481760	486480	currently under quarantine. Not much of a fucking quarantine then, is it? I mentioned rather
486480	492160	flippantly last time, more as a joke, that the coronavirus could actually render men infertile.
492160	495520	Turns out that that was not necessarily just a rumor, there may actually be something to it.
495520	499920	Coronavirus seems like the perfect storm. Reports that it can affect fertility and cause men to not
499920	503600	be able to reproduce with their sperm. People are still saying this might be some kind of
503600	509200	bio-engineered weapon that got loose accidentally. I don't know, maybe. At this point, fucking
509200	515040	anything's possible. This is from the Global Times, which is basically China's media outlet
515040	519680	in the West. And if an arm of the Chinese government is finally admitting this, we have
519680	524400	to know there's something to it. New Chinese study indicates the coronavirus did not originate
524400	529520	in the Huanan seafood market. Yeah, we all know it came from the bio lab at this point,
529520	533600	don't we? They don't say where it came from, but they say that patient zero transmitted the virus
533600	538800	to workers or sellers at the market. It didn't originate at the market. The market just allowed
538800	544960	it to spread very quickly. Alongside Italy and Iran, the last place to have a massive boom
544960	551440	recently was South Korea. And guys, this story is so wild, I don't know if you will even believe me.
551440	555680	But first of all, let's start with almost all the patients in the South Korean psychiatric ward
555680	561200	have the coronavirus. It turns out it is being spread around medical facilities.
561200	569280	But more importantly, there is, believe it or not, an actual death cult from South Korea,
569280	574000	and they have actually succeeded in spreading this thing around. They've been flying on planes
574000	581040	for weeks to spread the virus around other nations. I'm not kidding. This is not something
581040	585600	out of a video game. Let me show you. This is from the Washington Post.
585600	593120	South Korean coronavirus spike linked to doomsday sect with a messianic leader. A church in South
593120	598400	Korea with a messianic leader has been identified as a hotbed of coronavirus cases as the outbreak
598400	603840	grows in parts of the country. The leader of the sect, Lee Man Hee, said all gatherings
603840	609200	have been suspended after health authorities linked Lee's followers to more than two-thirds
609200	614240	of all confirmed coronavirus cases in South Korea. Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
614880	620800	said that 182 of South Korea's confirmed coronavirus cases were traced to Lee's secretive
620800	626880	religious movement, called the Shin Cheonji Church of Jesus of the Temple of the Tabernacle
626880	631280	of the Testimony. A 61-year-old woman who attended the church's branch in the southern
631280	636560	city of Daegu has been identified as patient zero by health authorities. The woman initially
636560	640240	refused doctors' requests that she be tested for the virus on the grounds that she had not
640240	646480	traveled abroad recently. Before she eventually was tested, she visited a hotel, a hospital,
646480	653040	and the church attended by some 1,000 members. The KCDC director told reporters that the services
653040	657920	which often gather followers in crowded spaces possibly led to mass transmissions.
657920	662080	The church is thought to have more than 200,000 adherents across the country.
662080	667440	Followers equate Lee with the second coming of Jesus to deliver believers from an impending end
667440	673440	of days. And here's some of the related activities of this church. 28 of 39 South Koreans who
673440	678080	recently made a group pilgrimage to Israel have now tested positive for coronavirus.
678640	683280	That's probably how it got into Israel. Turns out that same church is well established in New
683280	689680	Zealand with branches in Auckland and Wellington. Oh well, it's been nice knowing you. It'll be
689680	694800	okay, dude. It'll be okay. The New York Times also had to talk about this shadowy church at
694800	697840	the center of the coronavirus outbreak. At the meetings of this secretive church,
697840	702560	worshippers sit and pack together on the floor, forbidden to wear glasses or face masks. They
702560	707200	come to church even when sick. After services, they split up into groups for Bible study,
707200	711360	where they go out into the streets and proselytize. After the first coronavirus
711360	715520	infection was reported among its members, they were told to lie about being followers.
716400	720720	As of Saturday, more than 700 members of the church, which is considered a cult,
720720	724320	could still not be reached according to health officials who were frantically hoping to screen
724320	730480	them for signs of infection. Oh my God, dude. When you actually look at the places this church has
731040	739120	branches all over the world, you can see it kind of, I don't want to say this, it kind of follows
739120	747840	the map of the spread of the infection. A lot of these places got this virus, not necessarily from
747840	756720	China, but from South Korea and Japan. So I wonder, I don't know, maybe it's best not to
756720	761040	be a conspiracy theorist about this. Some more stupidity from the World Health Organization,
761040	763360	if you happen to need any more proof that they're fucking incompetent.
764080	768720	The WHO says it no longer has a process to declare a pandemic because the old system used that had
768720	776000	six phases is no longer in use. Okay, so I guess they just can't declare things pandemics anymore.
776000	782080	Awesome. Meanwhile, here's the WHO's chief saying that the world must prepare for a potential
782080	788480	pandemic. How do you even know what a pandemic is? You fucking clown. This thread that this is
788480	794560	in is actually just full of like kind of crazy breaking news about it. Yeah. Stuff from Iran,
794560	799680	stuff from China, stuff from Italy. There's apparently a flight being held. Let's see if
799680	804880	I can find it here. Tourist hotspots in the Italian city of Milan are closing their doors.
805760	810560	Oman reports first two cases of the virus. An Air Italy flight from Rome is being held
810560	815280	in quarantine. I guess they just can't leave the plane. The WHO believes that the coronavirus has
815280	821360	peaked and plateaued in China. Are you actually trusting China's numbers on this? All right,
821360	824880	guys, things are going crazy out there. As always, I'll end it with this. At this point,
824880	827920	you probably can't prevent yourself from getting sick. If you're going to get sick,
827920	832160	you're going to get sick. At the same time, it doesn't seem to kill that many people,
832160	837280	two to 3%. That is a higher percentage than the flu, yes, but you can definitely fight this off
837280	841920	if you're smart about it. The biggest problem now is the breakdown of worldwide shipping and
841920	845520	the fact that if it comes to your town, your grocery stores might not be getting a resupply
845520	850720	for a while. Get your supplies now before it shows up. If you're in a place like Milan,
850720	854080	I hope you listened to me a couple weeks ago, and if you're in a place like my city where
854080	860400	nothing's happened yet, now's the time to prepare. Buy a few extra weeks worth of food that can be
860400	865520	stored at room temperature, just kept dry, and you can probably ride this one out. You don't
865520	869120	want to be going out into a riot just because you ran out of food. Though in my case, I could
869120	874000	probably stand to lose some weight anyway. Alright guys, good luck out there. Don't lose hope. I love you.
