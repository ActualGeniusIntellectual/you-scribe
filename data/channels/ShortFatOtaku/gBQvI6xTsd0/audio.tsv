0	12020	Good morning, everyone. No, really. This is about 20 minutes after I got up. Got my coffee
12020	21900	here. There's your free sip outside of Sunday. And today, I have a long day of watching Kenobi
21900	27900	and writing a review for that amazing piece of cultural legacy that I'm sure will live
27900	32240	on forever. But before I get started on that, I wanted to at least quickly record something
32240	36160	that could come out today. And I know this is a little bit old. As always, I'm perpetually
36160	40680	behind the times. It's just a product of getting older. And so I wanted to take a peek at this
40680	47560	because you guys, if you haven't seen this yet, you guys will be blown away. This is
47560	52900	the TikTok page of Natasha Badger. As always, no one go bother this person. We're not here
52900	60340	to docs or dogpile or anything, but she works at LinkedIn in Chicago and she has quite a
60340	67660	few things to say about it. But this one here went viral both on TikTok and off. Day in
67660	72800	the life of 22 year old living in Chicago, working in the tech industry. Here we go.
72800	75700	Today was one of those days where you leave for work at 7 a.m. and you don't get back
75700	80120	until past midnight. It sounds like a really busy day, you know, when you're working like
80120	84600	what is that, 18 hours a day. Let's see her 18 hour workday. I left for work early for
84600	90080	a 9 a.m. meeting that was conveniently canceled right beforehand. Wait. Oh, I guess. Wait,
90080	94440	hold on. Wait, do you have like a two hour commute? You said your day started at seven,
94440	99200	but you're you're going into work for a 9 a.m. meeting. OK, but luckily I got to the
99200	103000	lobby and there were these eucalyptus towels waiting for me, which is really nice and some
103000	110480	fresh orange water, which I, of course, took before taking the elevator. OK, OK, so in
110480	118640	the lobby, if you work, it's too early in the morning for this. If you work at LinkedIn,
118640	126320	you can expect cold orange water in the lobby along with eucalyptus towels. I don't I don't
126320	130300	quite know what that means. Like, do they do they take the eucalyptus tree and they
130300	134660	just squeeze all the juice out of it, put it in the towel? Is that what's going on here?
134660	139140	Are they are they steamed? Maybe they're steamed by burning eucalyptus wood. I don't know.
139140	145700	What do you need a eucalyptus towel for? Do you like wash yourself? Hold on. So having
145700	151180	to take the terrible bus ride across Chicago, I mean, fair enough, it is Chicago. You come
151180	156700	in and you're filthy from having rubbed shoulders at the plebs and you just need a steamed eucalyptus
156700	161380	towel to brush yourself off with. Also, make sure you use those tongs to grab it. You got
161380	165420	to keep everything sterile and clean, especially because probably some low level worker put
165420	173120	that there for you. Also, aren't eucalyptus, hold on. It's a fast growing evergreen tree
173120	179840	native to Australia. Why is eucalyptus harmful to humans? Taking 3.5 milliliters of the oil
179840	185700	can be fatal, can induce nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. You know, I thought eucalyptus
185700	190500	was just like the food for koalas, but now I guess it's also this shit. And some fresh
190500	195260	orange water, which I of course took before taking the elevator up to the office. Of course
195260	200180	you have to take the fresh orange water. Who even drinks water without orange slices floating
200180	205020	around in it? I grabbed some breakfast, normal oatmeal and chia seed pudding and we finally
205020	209980	got LinkedIn. Wait, wait, what the fuck is this breakfast? Look at this. You got like
209980	214160	fresh fruit dishes. Somebody cut this shit up and laid it out for them. I grabbed some
214160	221240	breakfast, normal, normal. This is a normal breakfast. I mean, fair enough. It's, it's
221240	224820	pretty healthy. You know, you got all the, all the, all the good grains and nuts and
224820	229720	berries in there. Okay. Like this is a, this is a healthy breakfast, but Jesus, this ain't
229720	233640	normal. Most people aren't eating this. Most people can't afford to eat it. I don't think
233640	237720	I've ever actually worked at a job that had breakfast provided. There's always like eat
237720	242400	before you get in oatmeal and chia seed pudding. And we finally got LinkedIn mugs in the office,
242400	247720	which I'm so excited about. Are you just scrolling on Amazon as part of your workday?
247720	251520	Then I found out that the wall heart that we have in the office is made out of recycled
251520	269880	trees from Chicago, which was so cool. Fun. Recycled. Recycled. You know what? Oh God.
269880	275260	You know what a recycled trees is? It's wood. It's paper. What do you think your, your house
275260	280160	is made out of? What do you think you, you, you write on recycled? Man, I came from my,
280160	287360	my small town that I grew up in, how to recycle tree plant fact. And then it was time for
287360	291360	our company, all hands. So I grabbed our drink of the day, which is a blackberry mojito and
291360	297160	headed downstairs to the all hands room. So I'm like, okay, so the company, all hands,
297160	302880	you get a free black beer. What the fuck is a mojito? I don't even know. Can you imagine
302880	307200	working at this place? Sarah, it's time for the meeting. Don't forget to grab your blackberry
307200	313720	mojito. I paused on this like great looking lunch. Do they provide the lunch to co-workers
313720	318160	some lunches? We were starving after that. There was this, oh, I'm sure you were so starving
318160	323240	after that blackberry mojito meeting. And yeah, they, they have, you know, very, what
323240	327400	looks to be reasonably high class food available for them to eat. There's some lunches. We
327400	331720	were starving after that. There was this cool little dish and I grabbed a chai latte before
331720	337160	heading to work. I grabbed the chai latte before heading to work. You just had lunch.
337160	341020	What are you even doing all morning? Sounds like it's just been a whirlwind of mojitos
341020	347200	and chai lattes and Shia puddings. My coworkers play ping pong and then tried out a new quiet
347200	352120	room, which is a really nice area to just like relax and unplug from work. So your job
352120	357000	consists of you dicking around all morning. And then when it's time to really knuckle
357000	361920	down, you go to watch your coworkers play ping pong in the lounge. And then tried out
361920	368520	a new quiet room, which is a really nice area to just like relax and unplug from work. Unplug
368520	372980	from what work? What have you done all day? You're gonna go sit in the quiet room and
372980	376960	like pretend that you're in a forest or something. Look at that wallpaper. And then tried out
376960	381520	a new quiet room, which is a really nice area. And then tried out our new quiet room. It's
381520	386280	that exact inflection that everyone makes fun of. It's like, it's perfect. This is,
386280	390880	this is the perfect TikTok video. Shut the site down China. It's never getting any better
390880	395960	than this. Then it was time to buckle down. Like sat in our focus area for a while. I
395960	400800	grabbed, is this buckling down? It was time to buckle down. So I sat in the focus area
400800	405960	and got kettle potato. What the fuck? Sat in our focus area for a while. I grabbed a
405960	410160	snack after I was hungry. And then I finished up the rest of my work before getting an email
410160	417240	announcing the next team that I'll be joining through my... Finish up the rest. What work
417240	422720	even happened today? Before getting an email announcing the next team that I'll be joining
422720	428320	through my BLP program. Work was finally over. Oh, she's joining a new team, getting a promotion.
428320	434160	She earned it. All right. What is happening? What's what's happening now that work is finally
434160	438760	over? It was hot as hell. So we went to go get some drinks in Lincoln park before heading
438760	444360	to a housewarming party for one of our coworkers. Here we are. There was banana pudding. It
444360	448040	was just great summer vibes and really fun to connect with everyone. And then we last
448040	452200	minute decided, F it, let's go out. So we headed to West loop and went to Federales
452200	456280	really quick drink. At this point, I realized that I was still out with my work laptop.
456280	460640	So I decided to call it a night. Good night. Today was one of those days. Okay. Okay. So
460640	464280	that, that, that little last leg of the journey there, that's fine. You know, once you're
464280	466960	off the clock, do whatever you want. You're going to go drinking. You're gonna hit up
466960	471920	like three bars and two parties. That's not what I would do, but you have fun. But let's
471920	475440	listen to the start of this again. Today was one of those days where you leave for work
475440	479000	at 7.00 AM and you don't get back until past midnight. Okay. I mean, that's technically
479000	483780	true, right? She did leave for 7.00 AM and didn't get back till past midnight, but like
483780	489800	everything off the clock after work was just you partying. And then everything on the clock
489800	495680	was just you loafing around. There's no, there's no work happening here. Is there like, I don't
495720	501440	think I've ever had a day this pampered in my life. Even like when I was a school kid
501440	505240	where things not laid out this nicely for me, you know, you're the jobs that I've worked,
505240	508320	man. I've been the guy who collects garbage in front of your house in the morning. I've
508320	512280	been the guy who cuts all the grass for all the various public green spaces that everyone
512280	518360	seems to enjoy so much. I was that guy I've operated machinery. I've stocked shelves.
518360	523880	I've cleaned toilets, like actual jobs. Not, not to say that people who, you know, they
523880	527320	don't work with their hands, aren't necessarily doing actual work. There's a lot of valuable
527320	532480	work that comes out of people who work with their brains, but she's not doing either.
532480	536240	Where is the meaningful labor? It's not to be physical, but it has to be something right
536240	539580	now. If you look at this woman's tech talk account, you'll notice that there's actually
539580	545600	many different day in the life videos. So for example, here, day in the life as a 22
545600	549760	year old living in Chicago, working in tech, same video just earlier. Welcome to another
549760	553740	day in the life, working for LinkedIn, Chicago, get excited guys, because today LinkedIn hosted
553740	559060	its second music festival. This is a hybrid experience. So each office had their experiences,
559060	562500	but everyone could also stream virtually. So I got to the office, picked up my usual
562500	567040	breakfast. There's a coffee. So I had to get some nitro cold brew and literally sprinted
567040	570980	to a meeting that I was late for with one of the interns and had to try out our special
570980	574440	drink of the day, which was like a blackberry fizz headed to lunch. And this is just had
574440	579620	to look at this lunch. They have like a, like a hot dog cart in the building where the festivities
579620	585420	began. We had essentially a mini taste of Chicago with a lot of local vendors. Unfortunately,
585420	588300	I couldn't eat most of the stuff cause it had gluten in it, but look how pretty and
588300	596780	fun this was. There was a photo. I wonder, okay. Naomi actually has a real gluten intolerance.
596780	599940	She can't actually eat that much gluten, but here's the thing she can eat a little bit.
599940	604100	You know, if we give her like one slice of pizza where the dough is not gluten free,
604100	607700	she's okay. But any more than that, and over the course of a day, she starts to have stomach
607700	612620	problems. Um, I wonder if this person's actually gluten intolerant or if she's jumped on the
612620	618940	bandwagon of eating gluten free stuff because it sounds like organic or healthy or woke
618940	623660	or whatever photo booth. We had to go pick up our swag, not a huge fan of the t-shirt,
623660	627620	but it's fun. We got glow sticks too. And I took a mini break, played some ping pong
627620	634620	with James. He did beat me. Jesus Christ. Like this is, this is the workday. They don't
634620	638900	do anything at this place. Once a month, LinkedIn shuts down so its employees can focus
638900	642580	on our wellbeing. And today was one of those days I got up early this morning in the spirit
642580	647500	of wellbeing. I made myself some KMLT journal. I clicked on this. It's a day in the life
647500	652180	of worker at LinkedIn in Chicago because it was just a bunch of these, right? And this
652180	657100	one was like, I didn't go to work today. You know, my, my job is so stressful that I just
657100	661800	needed LinkedIn gave us all a day off cause it's just brutal there. There's another one
661800	666320	where she goes to Google and yes, at Google, they have the exact same problem where people
666320	671800	are just coming in and sucking up unbelievable amounts of money and benefits and gratuities
671800	675960	while doing no actual work. And she's done a bunch of these, but see, they haven't gotten
675960	681260	that many views as compared to the one here that recently went viral. I mean, she's living
681260	686580	a life of bourgeois indulgence, that's for sure, but that's not necessarily wrong or
686580	691780	immoral. I'm not a socialist. However, it does feel like it's something that can't last.
691780	696720	It's not sustainable. There's no way this makes money. It's going to come crashing down
696720	700900	on them. This is the kind of person that would literally say to the starving peasants, let
700900	706680	them eat cake. And of course she also has most of the normal progressive quasi socialist
706680	711940	opinions when it comes to politics. I've personally been over the whole independence day thing
711940	716960	for a couple of years now, but you guys have fun out there. Tagged with Roe V. Wade and
716960	720860	Black Lives Matter. This is for all my girlies who are going through imposter syndrome at
720860	730320	work. You're not a white man. Therefore they did not hire you on quality. That was like
730320	736840	a one, two punch. Okay. So for those of you who don't know imposter syndrome, imposter
736840	742120	syndrome is when you've made it, but you feel like you don't actually deserve to have made
742120	746080	it. And so you think that you're an imposter and you're a fraud and you'll be found out
746080	748840	and then you'll lose whatever success that you might've earned. And the reason people
748840	753780	feel this way is because you have to live with yourself every day. So you know very
753780	757980	deeply all of your greatest failures. However, other people, especially those who are say
757980	762820	hiring you or promoting you or accepting you, they only see your successes. So everyone
762820	766960	feels like, Oh man, if they only knew the worst side of me, I would lose this great
766960	770500	opportunity that I have. And I mean, sometimes that is true. Look at the falls from grace
770500	774620	that we've seen, but for the most part, it's not true at all. And the reason why it's so
774620	777980	funny is because clearly these people don't deserve anything that they have, but at the
777980	782520	same time, she goes on to say, you are not a white man. Therefore they did not hire you
782520	788240	unqualified. What do you think diversity hires are? This person, Natasha, what do you think
788240	792520	you bring to LinkedIn? Are you one of those nerdy guys who is like crouches in front of
792520	797000	the computer for like 16 hours a day, writing the actual backbone of the service that everyone
797000	801560	uses because it doesn't fucking seem like it from these tech talks. So yes, this person
801560	806540	is a young professional bourgeois lefty. One of many right now who are out there basically
806540	811120	just sucking up benefits, working at these positions that don't really bring any value
811120	815840	to the companies. And although I'm sure this is not the normal Zoomer experience, I in
815840	820140	fact know some Zoomers who are very working class and are certainly struggling quite a
820140	825380	bit right now. That's not this person. There does seem to be this microcosm of people who
825380	830580	live in these large cities and who work for these, basically these hollowed out giants.
830580	836400	They're just subsisting on the decaying mass that is once a great company. And as soon
836400	839920	as that falls apart, they'll all be out of jobs. But they don't see the end coming. They're
839920	844720	just living high and like, oh, this is just life. This is just good. They don't know how
844720	847880	atypical it actually is. So this is something I've been thinking about for a while. It's
847880	852400	not a fully formed idea yet, but maybe I can still, I don't know, bounce it off you guys
852400	857480	anyway. I was talking with Spoon maybe a week or two ago. Those of you who don't know, Spoon
857480	861960	is Aiden Paladin's co-host over on her show. He's a nice enough guy. We disagree on pretty
861960	864600	much everything because he's a monarchist and he's much more right-leaning than I am.
864680	867480	But I can talk to people I disagree with as long as they're nice. But I was just casually
867480	872560	discussing with him. I didn't use this graph in the discussion, but I'll use it here. You
872560	877400	can find graphs like this a lot. This is the share of the labor force employed in agriculture.
877400	881360	Share of people of working age who were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide
881360	886420	services for pay or profit in the agricultural sector, which is agriculture, hunting, forestry
886420	891320	and fishing. So basically what percentage of your society actually works in the creation
891320	896400	of food. And as you can see in the 1300s, 1400s, 1400s, it's pretty steady. We're hovering
896400	902540	between like 60 and 75%. So most people were working in the production of food and to get
902540	907400	out of that food production industry was actually considered to be a luxury. And if you think
907400	911160	back on it, this kind of makes sense, right? Like if you're in prehistory and everyone's
911160	916620	just hunting and foraging for survival, like 99% of your population at that point is working
916620	920880	on food. But as soon as people develop basic farming techniques and they didn't have to
920920	924400	be nomads anymore, they can actually settle into a city. The reason that that could happen
924400	928840	is because farming allowed for excess food produced with less labor, at least compared
928840	933280	to hunting and gathering. And so with the excess food, you could actually afford to
933280	939640	have more people who provided for society in other still important ways, but weren't
939640	945520	directly tied to food production. So you could have people who were smiths or people who
945520	950680	were priests, people who were scholars, people who manage the bureaucracy of a city, you
950680	954360	know, like, like guards, people who worked in defense. These are all people who do important
954360	958700	labor that helps develop the society. And yet they still eat food without contributing
958700	962600	any labor to food production. They still provide meaningful labor. They have to trade it for
962600	967680	the food. And the only way that this trade is even possible is if there is a surplus
967680	972760	of food. This is the main reason why hunter-gatherer societies don't really develop any kind of
972760	978340	formalized priest class. There's just not enough food to go around to spare individuals
978340	982660	to go off and do that sort of thing as a full-time job. And what this graph shows us
982660	986460	is that due to technological advancements over time, less and less people have been
986460	989740	involved in the production of food. And I'm not complaining about this. This is generally
989740	993780	a good thing because what that means is that that's more hands that are freed up to do
993780	997700	different types of more specialized labor. That's more brains that are freed up to be
997700	1001260	able to think up new ideas. And then maybe that develops into something very useful for
1001260	1007020	society. Getting people out of the farms creates a surplus of labor that can then be diversified
1007020	1012140	across an economy as well as allowing people to deeply specialize in one thing. But there
1012140	1016780	is a side effect of it. We now have a society of people that can work real jobs that do
1016780	1021740	provide real value. But nonetheless, those jobs are extremely divorced from the most
1021740	1026340	practical concerns like food or housing or clothing. And yet they can still pay for those
1026340	1030860	things. Money is an abstract way to transfer labor between different mediums. But we've
1030860	1036460	abstracted the whole thing out so much that somehow I can make YouTube videos that generate
1036460	1041280	enough equivalent labor as a worker who grows the food that I buy in the grocery store.
1041280	1046080	And it's this extreme level of abstraction that leads a lot of people, especially if
1046080	1050540	they've never actually worked a real working class job before these people, they become
1050540	1055440	unmoored from reality. There seems to be at least to me, a connection between the people
1055440	1061340	who believe in progressivism and socialism and a prosperous enough lifestyle to be extremely
1061340	1065700	disconnected from the essential labor that keeps them alive. I'm sure you've you've heard
1065700	1070060	the story many times. There's like a university professor who is like, food comes from the
1070060	1075300	store. Why do we have to kill animals? Why do we have farms? Why do you have to shoot
1075300	1078300	them? Why do you have to hunt? That's barbaric food, just just buy food at the store. And
1078300	1082260	like they don't know where the food comes from, because they're so divorced from that
1082260	1087860	part of reality. These people think that socialism works, because they are so disconnected from
1087860	1093460	how society runs, that they don't understand why it wouldn't work. It's having the privilege
1093460	1099260	of being blind to how the sausage is made. And this LinkedIn woman, it's not her fault.
1099260	1104360	She's not doing anything wrong, like morally, she's taking advantage of a system that allows
1104360	1109420	her to live this opulent life. But there's nothing real about it. It's all very manufactured.
1109420	1114700	It's all very artificial. It's all very divorced from the actual reality that most people have
1114700	1118660	to live. And I don't even think that she knows that that's the case. You know, if you go
1118660	1122380	really far down her page, she talks about her university experience. And it seems like
1122380	1127780	she went to a pretty good university for graphic design like this, this person came
1127780	1131220	from an upper middle class life for sure. She's never gonna know what it's like to drive
1131220	1136280	a truck for 16 hours, or have to take garbage to the dump. She fundamentally doesn't know
1136280	1141260	about everything happening outside of her field of vision that allows her to have this
1141260	1146140	this very cushy, bourgeois life, which is what makes it absolutely ridiculous that so
1146140	1151420	many people who live in these ivory towers think that their ideas are how society should
1151460	1155660	be structured. Things should be done according to their theories, but they're just so ignorant
1155660	1159400	of everything. Anyway, my friends, I hope you enjoyed this Hangout with Dev, and I will
1159400	1161420	see you next time. I love you.
