1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,020
Good morning, everyone. No, really. This is about 20 minutes after I got up. Got my coffee

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:21,900
here. There's your free sip outside of Sunday. And today, I have a long day of watching Kenobi

3
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,900
and writing a review for that amazing piece of cultural legacy that I'm sure will live

4
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,240
on forever. But before I get started on that, I wanted to at least quickly record something

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,160
that could come out today. And I know this is a little bit old. As always, I'm perpetually

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,680
behind the times. It's just a product of getting older. And so I wanted to take a peek at this

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,560
because you guys, if you haven't seen this yet, you guys will be blown away. This is

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,900
the TikTok page of Natasha Badger. As always, no one go bother this person. We're not here

9
00:00:52,900 --> 00:01:00,340
to docs or dogpile or anything, but she works at LinkedIn in Chicago and she has quite a

10
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:07,660
few things to say about it. But this one here went viral both on TikTok and off. Day in

11
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:12,800
the life of 22 year old living in Chicago, working in the tech industry. Here we go.

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,700
Today was one of those days where you leave for work at 7 a.m. and you don't get back

13
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,120
until past midnight. It sounds like a really busy day, you know, when you're working like

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,600
what is that, 18 hours a day. Let's see her 18 hour workday. I left for work early for

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,080
a 9 a.m. meeting that was conveniently canceled right beforehand. Wait. Oh, I guess. Wait,

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,440
hold on. Wait, do you have like a two hour commute? You said your day started at seven,

17
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,200
but you're you're going into work for a 9 a.m. meeting. OK, but luckily I got to the

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,000
lobby and there were these eucalyptus towels waiting for me, which is really nice and some

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,480
fresh orange water, which I, of course, took before taking the elevator. OK, OK, so in

20
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:58,640
the lobby, if you work, it's too early in the morning for this. If you work at LinkedIn,

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:06,320
you can expect cold orange water in the lobby along with eucalyptus towels. I don't I don't

22
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,300
quite know what that means. Like, do they do they take the eucalyptus tree and they

23
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,660
just squeeze all the juice out of it, put it in the towel? Is that what's going on here?

24
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,140
Are they are they steamed? Maybe they're steamed by burning eucalyptus wood. I don't know.

25
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,700
What do you need a eucalyptus towel for? Do you like wash yourself? Hold on. So having

26
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:31,180
to take the terrible bus ride across Chicago, I mean, fair enough, it is Chicago. You come

27
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:36,700
in and you're filthy from having rubbed shoulders at the plebs and you just need a steamed eucalyptus

28
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,380
towel to brush yourself off with. Also, make sure you use those tongs to grab it. You got

29
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,420
to keep everything sterile and clean, especially because probably some low level worker put

30
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:53,120
that there for you. Also, aren't eucalyptus, hold on. It's a fast growing evergreen tree

31
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,840
native to Australia. Why is eucalyptus harmful to humans? Taking 3.5 milliliters of the oil

32
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,700
can be fatal, can induce nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. You know, I thought eucalyptus

33
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,500
was just like the food for koalas, but now I guess it's also this shit. And some fresh

34
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,260
orange water, which I of course took before taking the elevator up to the office. Of course

35
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,180
you have to take the fresh orange water. Who even drinks water without orange slices floating

36
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,020
around in it? I grabbed some breakfast, normal oatmeal and chia seed pudding and we finally

37
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,980
got LinkedIn. Wait, wait, what the fuck is this breakfast? Look at this. You got like

38
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,160
fresh fruit dishes. Somebody cut this shit up and laid it out for them. I grabbed some

39
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:41,240
breakfast, normal, normal. This is a normal breakfast. I mean, fair enough. It's, it's

40
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,820
pretty healthy. You know, you got all the, all the, all the good grains and nuts and

41
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,720
berries in there. Okay. Like this is a, this is a healthy breakfast, but Jesus, this ain't

42
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,640
normal. Most people aren't eating this. Most people can't afford to eat it. I don't think

43
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,720
I've ever actually worked at a job that had breakfast provided. There's always like eat

44
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,400
before you get in oatmeal and chia seed pudding. And we finally got LinkedIn mugs in the office,

45
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,720
which I'm so excited about. Are you just scrolling on Amazon as part of your workday?

46
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,520
Then I found out that the wall heart that we have in the office is made out of recycled

47
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:29,880
trees from Chicago, which was so cool. Fun. Recycled. Recycled. You know what? Oh God.

48
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,260
You know what a recycled trees is? It's wood. It's paper. What do you think your, your house

49
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:40,160
is made out of? What do you think you, you, you write on recycled? Man, I came from my,

50
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:47,360
my small town that I grew up in, how to recycle tree plant fact. And then it was time for

51
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,360
our company, all hands. So I grabbed our drink of the day, which is a blackberry mojito and

52
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,160
headed downstairs to the all hands room. So I'm like, okay, so the company, all hands,

53
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,880
you get a free black beer. What the fuck is a mojito? I don't even know. Can you imagine

54
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,200
working at this place? Sarah, it's time for the meeting. Don't forget to grab your blackberry

55
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,720
mojito. I paused on this like great looking lunch. Do they provide the lunch to co-workers

56
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,160
some lunches? We were starving after that. There was this, oh, I'm sure you were so starving

57
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,240
after that blackberry mojito meeting. And yeah, they, they have, you know, very, what

58
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,400
looks to be reasonably high class food available for them to eat. There's some lunches. We

59
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,720
were starving after that. There was this cool little dish and I grabbed a chai latte before

60
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,160
heading to work. I grabbed the chai latte before heading to work. You just had lunch.

61
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,020
What are you even doing all morning? Sounds like it's just been a whirlwind of mojitos

62
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:47,200
and chai lattes and Shia puddings. My coworkers play ping pong and then tried out a new quiet

63
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,120
room, which is a really nice area to just like relax and unplug from work. So your job

64
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,000
consists of you dicking around all morning. And then when it's time to really knuckle

65
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,920
down, you go to watch your coworkers play ping pong in the lounge. And then tried out

66
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:08,520
a new quiet room, which is a really nice area to just like relax and unplug from work. Unplug

67
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,980
from what work? What have you done all day? You're gonna go sit in the quiet room and

68
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,960
like pretend that you're in a forest or something. Look at that wallpaper. And then tried out

69
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,520
a new quiet room, which is a really nice area. And then tried out our new quiet room. It's

70
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,280
that exact inflection that everyone makes fun of. It's like, it's perfect. This is,

71
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,880
this is the perfect TikTok video. Shut the site down China. It's never getting any better

72
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,960
than this. Then it was time to buckle down. Like sat in our focus area for a while. I

73
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,800
grabbed, is this buckling down? It was time to buckle down. So I sat in the focus area

74
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,960
and got kettle potato. What the fuck? Sat in our focus area for a while. I grabbed a

75
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,160
snack after I was hungry. And then I finished up the rest of my work before getting an email

76
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:57,240
announcing the next team that I'll be joining through my... Finish up the rest. What work

77
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,720
even happened today? Before getting an email announcing the next team that I'll be joining

78
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,320
through my BLP program. Work was finally over. Oh, she's joining a new team, getting a promotion.

79
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,160
She earned it. All right. What is happening? What's what's happening now that work is finally

80
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,760
over? It was hot as hell. So we went to go get some drinks in Lincoln park before heading

81
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,360
to a housewarming party for one of our coworkers. Here we are. There was banana pudding. It

82
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,040
was just great summer vibes and really fun to connect with everyone. And then we last

83
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,200
minute decided, F it, let's go out. So we headed to West loop and went to Federales

84
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,280
really quick drink. At this point, I realized that I was still out with my work laptop.

85
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,640
So I decided to call it a night. Good night. Today was one of those days. Okay. Okay. So

86
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,280
that, that, that little last leg of the journey there, that's fine. You know, once you're

87
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,960
off the clock, do whatever you want. You're going to go drinking. You're gonna hit up

88
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,920
like three bars and two parties. That's not what I would do, but you have fun. But let's

89
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,440
listen to the start of this again. Today was one of those days where you leave for work

90
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,000
at 7.00 AM and you don't get back until past midnight. Okay. I mean, that's technically

91
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,780
true, right? She did leave for 7.00 AM and didn't get back till past midnight, but like

92
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:09,800
everything off the clock after work was just you partying. And then everything on the clock

93
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,680
was just you loafing around. There's no, there's no work happening here. Is there like, I don't

94
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,440
think I've ever had a day this pampered in my life. Even like when I was a school kid

95
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,240
where things not laid out this nicely for me, you know, you're the jobs that I've worked,

96
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,320
man. I've been the guy who collects garbage in front of your house in the morning. I've

97
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,280
been the guy who cuts all the grass for all the various public green spaces that everyone

98
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:38,360
seems to enjoy so much. I was that guy I've operated machinery. I've stocked shelves.

99
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,880
I've cleaned toilets, like actual jobs. Not, not to say that people who, you know, they

100
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,320
don't work with their hands, aren't necessarily doing actual work. There's a lot of valuable

101
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,480
work that comes out of people who work with their brains, but she's not doing either.

102
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,240
Where is the meaningful labor? It's not to be physical, but it has to be something right

103
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,580
now. If you look at this woman's tech talk account, you'll notice that there's actually

104
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:05,600
many different day in the life videos. So for example, here, day in the life as a 22

105
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,760
year old living in Chicago, working in tech, same video just earlier. Welcome to another

106
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,740
day in the life, working for LinkedIn, Chicago, get excited guys, because today LinkedIn hosted

107
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:19,060
its second music festival. This is a hybrid experience. So each office had their experiences,

108
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,500
but everyone could also stream virtually. So I got to the office, picked up my usual

109
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,040
breakfast. There's a coffee. So I had to get some nitro cold brew and literally sprinted

110
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,980
to a meeting that I was late for with one of the interns and had to try out our special

111
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,440
drink of the day, which was like a blackberry fizz headed to lunch. And this is just had

112
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,620
to look at this lunch. They have like a, like a hot dog cart in the building where the festivities

113
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:45,420
began. We had essentially a mini taste of Chicago with a lot of local vendors. Unfortunately,

114
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,300
I couldn't eat most of the stuff cause it had gluten in it, but look how pretty and

115
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:56,780
fun this was. There was a photo. I wonder, okay. Naomi actually has a real gluten intolerance.

116
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,940
She can't actually eat that much gluten, but here's the thing she can eat a little bit.

117
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,100
You know, if we give her like one slice of pizza where the dough is not gluten free,

118
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,700
she's okay. But any more than that, and over the course of a day, she starts to have stomach

119
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,620
problems. Um, I wonder if this person's actually gluten intolerant or if she's jumped on the

120
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:18,940
bandwagon of eating gluten free stuff because it sounds like organic or healthy or woke

121
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,660
or whatever photo booth. We had to go pick up our swag, not a huge fan of the t-shirt,

122
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,620
but it's fun. We got glow sticks too. And I took a mini break, played some ping pong

123
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:34,620
with James. He did beat me. Jesus Christ. Like this is, this is the workday. They don't

124
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,900
do anything at this place. Once a month, LinkedIn shuts down so its employees can focus

125
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,580
on our wellbeing. And today was one of those days I got up early this morning in the spirit

126
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,500
of wellbeing. I made myself some KMLT journal. I clicked on this. It's a day in the life

127
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,180
of worker at LinkedIn in Chicago because it was just a bunch of these, right? And this

128
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:57,100
one was like, I didn't go to work today. You know, my, my job is so stressful that I just

129
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,800
needed LinkedIn gave us all a day off cause it's just brutal there. There's another one

130
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,320
where she goes to Google and yes, at Google, they have the exact same problem where people

131
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,800
are just coming in and sucking up unbelievable amounts of money and benefits and gratuities

132
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,960
while doing no actual work. And she's done a bunch of these, but see, they haven't gotten

133
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:21,260
that many views as compared to the one here that recently went viral. I mean, she's living

134
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:26,580
a life of bourgeois indulgence, that's for sure, but that's not necessarily wrong or

135
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,780
immoral. I'm not a socialist. However, it does feel like it's something that can't last.

136
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:36,720
It's not sustainable. There's no way this makes money. It's going to come crashing down

137
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,900
on them. This is the kind of person that would literally say to the starving peasants, let

138
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:46,680
them eat cake. And of course she also has most of the normal progressive quasi socialist

139
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,940
opinions when it comes to politics. I've personally been over the whole independence day thing

140
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,960
for a couple of years now, but you guys have fun out there. Tagged with Roe V. Wade and

141
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,860
Black Lives Matter. This is for all my girlies who are going through imposter syndrome at

142
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:10,320
work. You're not a white man. Therefore they did not hire you on quality. That was like

143
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,840
a one, two punch. Okay. So for those of you who don't know imposter syndrome, imposter

144
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:22,120
syndrome is when you've made it, but you feel like you don't actually deserve to have made

145
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,080
it. And so you think that you're an imposter and you're a fraud and you'll be found out

146
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,840
and then you'll lose whatever success that you might've earned. And the reason people

147
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,780
feel this way is because you have to live with yourself every day. So you know very

148
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,980
deeply all of your greatest failures. However, other people, especially those who are say

149
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,820
hiring you or promoting you or accepting you, they only see your successes. So everyone

150
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,960
feels like, Oh man, if they only knew the worst side of me, I would lose this great

151
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,500
opportunity that I have. And I mean, sometimes that is true. Look at the falls from grace

152
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,620
that we've seen, but for the most part, it's not true at all. And the reason why it's so

153
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,980
funny is because clearly these people don't deserve anything that they have, but at the

154
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,520
same time, she goes on to say, you are not a white man. Therefore they did not hire you

155
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:08,240
unqualified. What do you think diversity hires are? This person, Natasha, what do you think

156
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,520
you bring to LinkedIn? Are you one of those nerdy guys who is like crouches in front of

157
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,000
the computer for like 16 hours a day, writing the actual backbone of the service that everyone

158
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,560
uses because it doesn't fucking seem like it from these tech talks. So yes, this person

159
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,540
is a young professional bourgeois lefty. One of many right now who are out there basically

160
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,120
just sucking up benefits, working at these positions that don't really bring any value

161
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,840
to the companies. And although I'm sure this is not the normal Zoomer experience, I in

162
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,140
fact know some Zoomers who are very working class and are certainly struggling quite a

163
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:45,380
bit right now. That's not this person. There does seem to be this microcosm of people who

164
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:50,580
live in these large cities and who work for these, basically these hollowed out giants.

165
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:56,400
They're just subsisting on the decaying mass that is once a great company. And as soon

166
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,920
as that falls apart, they'll all be out of jobs. But they don't see the end coming. They're

167
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,720
just living high and like, oh, this is just life. This is just good. They don't know how

168
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,880
atypical it actually is. So this is something I've been thinking about for a while. It's

169
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,400
not a fully formed idea yet, but maybe I can still, I don't know, bounce it off you guys

170
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,480
anyway. I was talking with Spoon maybe a week or two ago. Those of you who don't know, Spoon

171
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,960
is Aiden Paladin's co-host over on her show. He's a nice enough guy. We disagree on pretty

172
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,600
much everything because he's a monarchist and he's much more right-leaning than I am.

173
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,480
But I can talk to people I disagree with as long as they're nice. But I was just casually

174
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,560
discussing with him. I didn't use this graph in the discussion, but I'll use it here. You

175
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,400
can find graphs like this a lot. This is the share of the labor force employed in agriculture.

176
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,360
Share of people of working age who were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide

177
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,420
services for pay or profit in the agricultural sector, which is agriculture, hunting, forestry

178
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,320
and fishing. So basically what percentage of your society actually works in the creation

179
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,400
of food. And as you can see in the 1300s, 1400s, 1400s, it's pretty steady. We're hovering

180
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:02,540
between like 60 and 75%. So most people were working in the production of food and to get

181
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,400
out of that food production industry was actually considered to be a luxury. And if you think

182
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,160
back on it, this kind of makes sense, right? Like if you're in prehistory and everyone's

183
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,620
just hunting and foraging for survival, like 99% of your population at that point is working

184
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,880
on food. But as soon as people develop basic farming techniques and they didn't have to

185
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,400
be nomads anymore, they can actually settle into a city. The reason that that could happen

186
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,840
is because farming allowed for excess food produced with less labor, at least compared

187
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,280
to hunting and gathering. And so with the excess food, you could actually afford to

188
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:39,640
have more people who provided for society in other still important ways, but weren't

189
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:45,520
directly tied to food production. So you could have people who were smiths or people who

190
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,680
were priests, people who were scholars, people who manage the bureaucracy of a city, you

191
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,360
know, like, like guards, people who worked in defense. These are all people who do important

192
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,700
labor that helps develop the society. And yet they still eat food without contributing

193
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,600
any labor to food production. They still provide meaningful labor. They have to trade it for

194
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,680
the food. And the only way that this trade is even possible is if there is a surplus

195
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,760
of food. This is the main reason why hunter-gatherer societies don't really develop any kind of

196
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:18,340
formalized priest class. There's just not enough food to go around to spare individuals

197
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,660
to go off and do that sort of thing as a full-time job. And what this graph shows us

198
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,460
is that due to technological advancements over time, less and less people have been

199
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,740
involved in the production of food. And I'm not complaining about this. This is generally

200
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,780
a good thing because what that means is that that's more hands that are freed up to do

201
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,700
different types of more specialized labor. That's more brains that are freed up to be

202
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,260
able to think up new ideas. And then maybe that develops into something very useful for

203
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:47,020
society. Getting people out of the farms creates a surplus of labor that can then be diversified

204
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:52,140
across an economy as well as allowing people to deeply specialize in one thing. But there

205
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,780
is a side effect of it. We now have a society of people that can work real jobs that do

206
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:01,740
provide real value. But nonetheless, those jobs are extremely divorced from the most

207
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,340
practical concerns like food or housing or clothing. And yet they can still pay for those

208
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:10,860
things. Money is an abstract way to transfer labor between different mediums. But we've

209
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:16,460
abstracted the whole thing out so much that somehow I can make YouTube videos that generate

210
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:21,280
enough equivalent labor as a worker who grows the food that I buy in the grocery store.

211
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,080
And it's this extreme level of abstraction that leads a lot of people, especially if

212
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,540
they've never actually worked a real working class job before these people, they become

213
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,440
unmoored from reality. There seems to be at least to me, a connection between the people

214
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,340
who believe in progressivism and socialism and a prosperous enough lifestyle to be extremely

215
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,700
disconnected from the essential labor that keeps them alive. I'm sure you've you've heard

216
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:50,060
the story many times. There's like a university professor who is like, food comes from the

217
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:55,300
store. Why do we have to kill animals? Why do we have farms? Why do you have to shoot

218
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,300
them? Why do you have to hunt? That's barbaric food, just just buy food at the store. And

219
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,260
like they don't know where the food comes from, because they're so divorced from that

220
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:07,860
part of reality. These people think that socialism works, because they are so disconnected from

221
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:13,460
how society runs, that they don't understand why it wouldn't work. It's having the privilege

222
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:19,260
of being blind to how the sausage is made. And this LinkedIn woman, it's not her fault.

223
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,360
She's not doing anything wrong, like morally, she's taking advantage of a system that allows

224
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,420
her to live this opulent life. But there's nothing real about it. It's all very manufactured.

225
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:34,700
It's all very artificial. It's all very divorced from the actual reality that most people have

226
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,660
to live. And I don't even think that she knows that that's the case. You know, if you go

227
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,380
really far down her page, she talks about her university experience. And it seems like

228
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:47,780
she went to a pretty good university for graphic design like this, this person came

229
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,220
from an upper middle class life for sure. She's never gonna know what it's like to drive

230
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:56,280
a truck for 16 hours, or have to take garbage to the dump. She fundamentally doesn't know

231
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,260
about everything happening outside of her field of vision that allows her to have this

232
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:06,140
this very cushy, bourgeois life, which is what makes it absolutely ridiculous that so

233
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:11,420
many people who live in these ivory towers think that their ideas are how society should

234
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,660
be structured. Things should be done according to their theories, but they're just so ignorant

235
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,400
of everything. Anyway, my friends, I hope you enjoyed this Hangout with Dev, and I will

236
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,420
see you next time. I love you.
