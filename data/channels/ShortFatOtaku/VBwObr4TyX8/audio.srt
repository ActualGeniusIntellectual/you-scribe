1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
You know, the notion that people must buy a product to defeat their cultural enemies,

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,800
regardless of the product's quality or their personal enjoyment of it,

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,160
is probably the greatest marketing gimmick ever conceived.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,360
And really, regardless of the political slant of the product itself, or its audience,

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,520
everyone's doing this sort of thing now. I mean, it takes no time at all to hop on the internet

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,640
and find at least somebody who's angry about Joker getting a whole bunch of Oscar nominations,

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,520
considering how baselessly demonized and vilified that product was.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,280
And even though it wasn't an incel movie,

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,160
the incel community did definitely embrace it and kind of push it as its own.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,000
On the flip side of that, we have something like Ghostbusters 2016,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,040
which was so bad that the next Ghostbusters movie is going to completely skip it

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,520
and continue from the original Ghostbusters canon.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,120
People like AVGN, who's generally pretty apolitical,

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,960
even he came out and said,

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,960
no, I refuse, and received a massive backlash as being this hateful gamer man baby,

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,240
even though that's probably the single most inaccurate description of James Rolfe

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,360
that I've ever heard, regardless of what character he might play on the internet.

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,640
But despite the movie being a complete pile of shit and also being a financial failure,

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,680
people online, even to this day, still defend it because, hey, it's part of their team.

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,040
Ghostbusters 2016 was a glorious gift to fans.

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,200
And the new director is a bitter dude, bro,

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,480
who's going to make a steaming pile of shit and call it a masterpiece.

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,440
This is the thing.

24
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,960
It wasn't a glorious gift to fans.

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,720
It was a glorious gift to you.

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,880
Maybe you were a fan of the original Ghostbusters.

27
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,600
Who knows?

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,000
But very clearly, most of the fans didn't like it.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,040
They didn't watch it.

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,480
It made no money.

31
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,080
People voted with their wallets.

32
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,240
But more than that, see what this person's done?

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,880
At least in terms of this conversation,

34
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,880
they've pinned it all on the fact that this movie had to be a success.

35
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,120
Now, unless she has stock in the production company or something, it actually doesn't matter.

36
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,160
It doesn't matter to me if I like a movie that no one else likes.

37
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,440
I can still like that movie.

38
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,840
I can still go and rewatch it whenever I like.

39
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,480
It isn't, or at least it shouldn't be,

40
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,360
a social or political statement to just enjoy the media that you like.

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,880
But that's what it is nowadays, because everything's political.

42
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,720
And if a movie or a TV series or a game or whatever becomes a financial success

43
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,040
and it also pushes your politics,

44
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,480
then that is one step closer to victory and the great culture war.

45
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,040
But more importantly, it means that you can't ever simply sit down

46
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,200
and enjoy something on its merits.

47
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,040
You're always looking at it through a lens.

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,960
And frankly, it becomes kind of tiring.

49
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,440
I think this attitude can best be summed up by this next clip.

50
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,240
And you know what?

51
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,000
You probably know what I'm going to play.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,680
In fact, here, here, pause the video, put in the timestamp,

53
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,800
this timestamp right now where you paused it, and then tell me in the comments,

54
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,680
what clip do you think I'm about to play at this timestamp?

55
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,040
Come on, be honest.

56
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,480
I don't want anyone cheating.

57
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,760
But yeah, here we go.

58
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,720
Don't ask questions.

59
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,320
Just consume product and then get excited for next products.

60
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,840
Of course, of course.

61
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,680
But here's the ideological reason why that meme has received such backlash.

62
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,920
If someone posts this, what they really mean is,

63
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,200
I hate if there's women and minorities in my movies.

64
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,960
That's actually not what they said.

65
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,040
And it's actually not what they're complaining about.

66
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,720
But because to you, consumerism is just another wing in the culture war.

67
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,000
That's how you view it.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,120
When somebody has a legitimate complaint against a movie or whatever,

69
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,320
it's no longer legitimate to you.

70
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,120
It's just politics.

71
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,280
It all gets boiled down to politics.

72
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,200
The quality of these things doesn't actually matter, just the power behind it all.

73
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,680
Which is why I absolutely love the fact that the caricature of this consuming culture warrior

74
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,240
has been immortalized in the face of my dear friend, Moviebob.

75
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,960
The 38 year old consumer.

76
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,360
This is probably the funniest Wojak that has ever been made out of all Wojaks,

77
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,880
to be honest, at least to me anyway.

78
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,000
I know it's meant to be like a meme and you could like map it onto other people,

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,120
but this really does hit home with Moviebob specifically, doesn't it?

80
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,640
I mean, he's definitely one of those failed that guy with the glasses type.

81
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,320
So he definitely prioritizes his video reviews on YouTube,

82
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,080
even as he talks about the progressive communist ethnostate in space

83
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,080
and how he should be roaming the stars right now if it weren't for those rednecks.

84
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,760
However, there's definitely something to this here regarding political views

85
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,880
focused around being vindictive towards people who were mean to him in high school.

86
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,520
It's kind of strange because the radical left seems to be made up of two types of people.

87
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,160
Generally, you have the people who are victimized by bullies in high school

88
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,840
and they have since become middle class, like insufferable middle class,

89
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,160
almost like they're Karens or wine moms or something.

90
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,920
And so basically they're bougie socialists who are looking for a way to be a victim,

91
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,680
even though they're straight and white.

92
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,440
So they talk about the rich all the time,

93
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,080
you know, the people who actually made it somewhere through their own hard work.

94
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,560
Then the other half are the bullies themselves.

95
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
They also end up falling into this camp as well.

96
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,280
These would be like the Zoe Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian types.

97
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,920
You can tell that these people back in school,

98
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,320
they were probably like the queen bitch of the playground,

99
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,760
bullying and making fun of people.

100
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,400
And now those same nerds and gamers that they've bullied,

101
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,880
they've come back with in their 20s and 30s to fuck with

102
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,280
on either the political stage or on the media stage.

103
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,240
And you'll notice that I talked about primarily women in those two examples,

104
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,080
and that's for a specific reason.

105
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,680
And no, it's not misogyny.

106
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,760
You get articles like this, for example,

107
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,680
We're not unicorns, we exist.

108
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,480
How the fake geek girl concept inspired the geek girls are real project.

109
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,240
This is a very long, very boring article about how women who are into comic books

110
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,920
and movies and video games and other things that generally only men

111
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
would have been into in the early 90s.

112
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,440
Well, they do actually exist.

113
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,080
And you know what?

114
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,120
Yeah, I know.

115
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,640
I think we all know.

116
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,800
When I was young, they were quite rare.

117
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,040
You know, nearly every boy played video games at some point,

118
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,560
but the number of girls who played video games,

119
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,040
you can count on one hand in my town, at least when I was a kid.

120
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,360
But nowadays, you know, gamer girls are everywhere.

121
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,160
I'm dating one.

122
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,000
But this whole article talks like these fake gamer girls or whatever,

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,560
that they don't exist and the very concept of them is sexist.

124
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,080
And I'm just like, no, I've met them.

125
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,000
My best friend has actually been in the clutches of several of them

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,280
over the course of his life.

127
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,600
Like he ends up dating a girl because she talks about being very into video games.

128
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,840
And then after she's got her claws synced in, she's very clearly not into them at all.

129
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,960
And then it's like a multi-year project to get him away from her

130
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,040
because she's basically destroying his life.

131
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,840
I've seen that happen multiple times in my friend group.

132
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,240
You can't tell me this type of woman doesn't exist.

133
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,120
And this example isn't anything nerdy or related to video games,

134
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,120
but it's still the same example and you get my point.

135
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,880
This person here poses and says they want a photoshop done

136
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,320
and they're wearing a kiss t-shirt.

137
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,160
And then the person in the reply says, your five favorite kiss songs go.

138
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,480
Next reply is you're a moron lol.

139
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,440
Oh, you like music?

140
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,800
Name every song ever.

141
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,280
And you know what?

142
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,680
It's fair.

143
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,920
Like if you're part of a demographic that doesn't necessarily normally like something,

144
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,120
but you actually like it, then you get quizzed on it constantly

145
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,680
because people think that you're being a fake fan for attention

146
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,120
or trying to get a guy or just to get some kind of social clout or whatever.

147
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,880
I can see how that'd be really annoying.

148
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,520
At the same time, there are women who do this.

149
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,960
There are men who do this.

150
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,000
Like how many times has a man lied to get into a girl's pants?

151
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,440
At least in hookup culture, that seems to happen quite a bit, doesn't it?

152
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,360
And here's a funny little comic about the same thing.

153
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,280
You know, there's a nerd girl here who likes an anime

154
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,480
and she ends up getting quizzed by the guy

155
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,440
and then she reveals her power level at the end of the comic, you know?

156
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,600
And it's like black women like anime.

157
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,280
Stop quizzing women on nerd stuff.

158
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,560
But then the other point of view is that guys don't just quiz nerdy women on this stuff.

159
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,560
They quiz each other all the time.

160
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,360
Nerdy guys definitely have nerd offs or they get into in-depth discussions

161
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,480
about the things that they're very, very passionate about.

162
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,160
But it seems to be only the women that take it as a personal attack

163
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,960
that their interests are, well, being taken interest in.

164
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,160
Aside from just a surface level of that's cool.

165
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,880
If this is something that happens to guys regularly in these spaces and no one bats an eye,

166
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,640
you can't suddenly call it sexist because it also happens to women when they show up.

167
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,440
And I do mean when they show up, because there's definitely a shared suffering

168
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,520
that seems to go with being a gamer or being a nerdy guy.

169
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,840
At least if you're my age, maybe not so much if you're like a teenager nowadays,

170
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,080
because I think that's thankfully been weeded out.

171
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,000
And you know what? It's a good thing it's been done away with.

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But when I was a kid, even though most boys had played video games,

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,480
the ones that were really into them, they were the nerds.

174
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,040
And they were the ones that were bullied.

175
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,040
They were bullied by the girls and they were bullied by the guys.

176
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,840
And so when you had your little clique of video game loving friends,

177
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,840
you did have to self police a little bit.

178
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,280
You know, there was definitely like a loneliness and an introversion

179
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,160
and almost a type of victimhood that being a gamer, at least when I was a kid, came with.

180
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,120
You know, now I'm starting to sound like, you know, gamers rise up.

181
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,160
The Joker movie was our Bible in cells, the whole thing.

182
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,760
Right. And that's not where I'm going with this.

183
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,200
But if you don't think that at one point in time, maybe that Super Nintendo or whatever,

184
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,680
back in their basement was their only source of solace to get them through the school years.

185
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,240
If you don't think that happened, then it seems like you don't understand the,

186
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,200
to use a social justice term, lived experiences of a lot of young men.

187
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,840
And at some point, and I'm not sure when this happened, but at some point

188
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,920
that suffering became part of the identity.

189
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,840
These are older memes, but they do check out and they definitely tell a story.

190
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,800
A story of what these guys had to do to basically get by, at least when they were younger.

191
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,400
And you know what?

192
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,600
Some of them are unfortunate enough that they're still doing it now,

193
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,240
but there's a shared suffering in it.

194
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,680
I recall quite vividly to be a gamer in the early nineties.

195
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,280
You couldn't simply just play video games, though that was the primary thing you had to do.

196
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,280
There was also this idea of, well, I got bullied and all my friends got bullied.

197
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,800
And those people who are growing up now playing video games and not getting bullied for it.

198
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,440
Yeah, they've got a better time of it, but they also don't understand how good they have it.

199
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,600
It almost feels like they're taking that gamer status or that nerd status and they're running

200
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,200
with it without suffering to get it the way that we had to.

201
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,240
And you know what?

202
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,080
There's definitely a feeling like this among the LGBT crowd as well.

203
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,800
Gay teens and lesbian teens growing up now

204
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,840
do not have to suffer nearly as much as they did when I was in school.

205
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,320
That's obviously a good thing at the same time.

206
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,800
However, if being discriminated against is part of your LGBT identity,

207
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,160
then what do you do when LGBT people appear

208
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,440
that have not actually experienced being discriminated against?

209
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:31,940
I don't know.

210
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,240
Maybe that's where radicalism comes from.

211
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,760
Maybe that's where inter-movement conflict comes from.

212
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,560
I'm not sure.

213
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,080
But my point is, it's not simply sexism when guys try to weed out the fake gamer girls

214
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,960
because they exist.

215
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,320
They can ruin friendships.

216
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,760
They can ruin people.

217
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,280
And I'm not saying this is unique to women.

218
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,640
Men ruin women all the time.

219
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,360
But this is one of the ways in which women do it to men.

220
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,560
And so they know this and they focus on it.

221
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,720
And this all relates back to the consumer because the consumer

222
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,600
seems to have completely forgotten that this is the case.

223
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,000
They don't consider their hobby to be a unified community.

224
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,960
They consider it to be a political activist movement.

225
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,640
And that's why to them, weeding out potentially toxic people

226
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,400
is considered to be gatekeeping, especially if that person's a woman.

227
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,200
And I want to make it absolutely clear, I'm talking very broad strokes here.

228
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,440
Obviously, there are women involved in video games even before I was born,

229
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,320
but those were definitely the exception and not the rule.

230
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,440
Yes, women have been involved in the creation of comic books since then.

231
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,800
Yes, women have been involved in the creation of comic books,

232
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,160
of science fiction, of movies, of video games,

233
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,320
since the inception of all of these mediums.

234
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,880
But again, exception, not the rule.

235
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,720
This image is from long before gamer game.

236
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,920
However, it's definitely still relevant.

237
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,880
Could probably use some updating just to at least add some new years on it.

238
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,440
A history of women and video games throughout the years.

239
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,400
From 95 to 2005, LOL look at the loser in his video games.

240
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,040
Yeah, pretty much.

241
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,560
And then, why won't anyone give me attention?

242
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,640
The cake is a lie XD.

243
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,840
So that's them trying to spout off the most surface level memes to try and get into the group.

244
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,920
Girls can play games too, you know.

245
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,160
I'm a girl gamer.

246
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,840
Girls are just as good as guys, pretty much.

247
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,680
And like, up until this point, things are fine.

248
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,240
You want in, you want to play video games, that's fine.

249
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,200
Go ahead and play them.

250
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,280
If you want into a pre-established community,

251
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,960
follow the pre-established rules of that pre-established community and you're golden.

252
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,680
It's fine.

253
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,480
But then suddenly, video games are sexist and video games must cater to our needs.

254
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,640
All of this is pretty much exemplified by the oh no comic.

255
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,080
You do not fit in here.

256
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,840
Okay, we will make our own place.

257
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,960
Why are you excluding us?

258
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh no, that is pretty much how it works.

259
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,920
It's tough being a pariah, even in a minor sense, like just socially or something.

260
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,520
But it also means that you're outside the bounds of the culture,

261
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,600
so you can discover new things, invent new things, create your own place.

262
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,920
But the consumer is somebody who has taken that status,

263
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,000
and they've probably legitimately earned it.

264
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,320
Throughout their own lifetime of experiences.

265
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,760
And they've turned it political.

266
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,880
And they've twisted it away from what it was once all about.

267
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:16,080
Which was the game or the movie, the passion, the hobby, the human connection, the fun.

268
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,360
And now it's all about politics.

269
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,760
Now it's all about support Ghostbusters 2016 or else you're a bigot.

270
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,360
Now it's all about only incel dude bros liking Joker.

271
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,600
We have finally managed to consistently and effectively commoditize human passion.

272
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,160
Only it didn't come from the hyper corporatist right-wing of politics

273
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,440
like frankly I thought it would, but it came from the left.

274
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,480
It came from the left in their all-encompassing desire to win the culture war

275
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,840
and wield the power that comes with that victory.

276
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,040
So it doesn't matter how bad Captain Marvel 2 is going to be.

277
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,680
You have to buy those movie tickets to defeat the alt-right.

278
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,120
You don't have to enjoy that movie, you just have to consume it.
