0	5120	You know, the notion that people must buy a product to defeat their cultural enemies,
5120	8800	regardless of the product's quality or their personal enjoyment of it,
8800	12160	is probably the greatest marketing gimmick ever conceived.
12160	17360	And really, regardless of the political slant of the product itself, or its audience,
17360	21520	everyone's doing this sort of thing now. I mean, it takes no time at all to hop on the internet
21520	26640	and find at least somebody who's angry about Joker getting a whole bunch of Oscar nominations,
26640	31520	considering how baselessly demonized and vilified that product was.
31520	33280	And even though it wasn't an incel movie,
33280	38160	the incel community did definitely embrace it and kind of push it as its own.
38160	42000	On the flip side of that, we have something like Ghostbusters 2016,
42000	47040	which was so bad that the next Ghostbusters movie is going to completely skip it
47040	49520	and continue from the original Ghostbusters canon.
49520	53120	People like AVGN, who's generally pretty apolitical,
53120	54960	even he came out and said,
54960	60960	no, I refuse, and received a massive backlash as being this hateful gamer man baby,
60960	64240	even though that's probably the single most inaccurate description of James Rolfe
64240	67360	that I've ever heard, regardless of what character he might play on the internet.
67360	72640	But despite the movie being a complete pile of shit and also being a financial failure,
72640	77680	people online, even to this day, still defend it because, hey, it's part of their team.
77680	81040	Ghostbusters 2016 was a glorious gift to fans.
81040	83200	And the new director is a bitter dude, bro,
83200	86480	who's going to make a steaming pile of shit and call it a masterpiece.
86480	87440	This is the thing.
87440	88960	It wasn't a glorious gift to fans.
88960	90720	It was a glorious gift to you.
90720	92880	Maybe you were a fan of the original Ghostbusters.
92880	93600	Who knows?
93600	96000	But very clearly, most of the fans didn't like it.
96000	97040	They didn't watch it.
97040	98480	It made no money.
98480	100080	People voted with their wallets.
100080	102240	But more than that, see what this person's done?
102880	104880	At least in terms of this conversation,
104880	108880	they've pinned it all on the fact that this movie had to be a success.
108880	113120	Now, unless she has stock in the production company or something, it actually doesn't matter.
113120	116160	It doesn't matter to me if I like a movie that no one else likes.
116160	117440	I can still like that movie.
117440	119840	I can still go and rewatch it whenever I like.
119840	122480	It isn't, or at least it shouldn't be,
122480	127360	a social or political statement to just enjoy the media that you like.
127360	130880	But that's what it is nowadays, because everything's political.
130880	136720	And if a movie or a TV series or a game or whatever becomes a financial success
136720	139040	and it also pushes your politics,
139040	142480	then that is one step closer to victory and the great culture war.
142480	147040	But more importantly, it means that you can't ever simply sit down
147040	149200	and enjoy something on its merits.
149200	151040	You're always looking at it through a lens.
151040	152960	And frankly, it becomes kind of tiring.
152960	155440	I think this attitude can best be summed up by this next clip.
155440	156240	And you know what?
156240	158000	You probably know what I'm going to play.
158000	161680	In fact, here, here, pause the video, put in the timestamp,
161680	164800	this timestamp right now where you paused it, and then tell me in the comments,
164800	167680	what clip do you think I'm about to play at this timestamp?
167680	169040	Come on, be honest.
169040	170480	I don't want anyone cheating.
170480	171760	But yeah, here we go.
173360	174720	Don't ask questions.
174720	178320	Just consume product and then get excited for next products.
178320	179840	Of course, of course.
179840	183680	But here's the ideological reason why that meme has received such backlash.
184480	187920	If someone posts this, what they really mean is,
187920	191200	I hate if there's women and minorities in my movies.
191200	192960	That's actually not what they said.
192960	195040	And it's actually not what they're complaining about.
195040	200720	But because to you, consumerism is just another wing in the culture war.
200720	202000	That's how you view it.
202000	205120	When somebody has a legitimate complaint against a movie or whatever,
205120	206320	it's no longer legitimate to you.
206320	207120	It's just politics.
207120	209280	It all gets boiled down to politics.
209280	213200	The quality of these things doesn't actually matter, just the power behind it all.
213280	219680	Which is why I absolutely love the fact that the caricature of this consuming culture warrior
220400	224240	has been immortalized in the face of my dear friend, Moviebob.
225040	226960	The 38 year old consumer.
227520	231360	This is probably the funniest Wojak that has ever been made out of all Wojaks,
231360	232880	to be honest, at least to me anyway.
232880	236000	I know it's meant to be like a meme and you could like map it onto other people,
236000	239120	but this really does hit home with Moviebob specifically, doesn't it?
239120	242640	I mean, he's definitely one of those failed that guy with the glasses type.
243040	246320	So he definitely prioritizes his video reviews on YouTube,
246320	250080	even as he talks about the progressive communist ethnostate in space
250080	254080	and how he should be roaming the stars right now if it weren't for those rednecks.
254080	257760	However, there's definitely something to this here regarding political views
257760	260880	focused around being vindictive towards people who were mean to him in high school.
260880	265520	It's kind of strange because the radical left seems to be made up of two types of people.
265520	270160	Generally, you have the people who are victimized by bullies in high school
270800	273840	and they have since become middle class, like insufferable middle class,
273840	276160	almost like they're Karens or wine moms or something.
276160	279920	And so basically they're bougie socialists who are looking for a way to be a victim,
279920	281680	even though they're straight and white.
281680	283440	So they talk about the rich all the time,
283440	286080	you know, the people who actually made it somewhere through their own hard work.
286080	288560	Then the other half are the bullies themselves.
288560	290560	They also end up falling into this camp as well.
290560	293280	These would be like the Zoe Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian types.
293280	295920	You can tell that these people back in school,
295920	298320	they were probably like the queen bitch of the playground,
298320	299760	bullying and making fun of people.
299760	302400	And now those same nerds and gamers that they've bullied,
302400	304880	they've come back with in their 20s and 30s to fuck with
304880	307280	on either the political stage or on the media stage.
307280	310240	And you'll notice that I talked about primarily women in those two examples,
310240	312080	and that's for a specific reason.
312080	313680	And no, it's not misogyny.
313680	315760	You get articles like this, for example,
315760	317680	We're not unicorns, we exist.
317680	322480	How the fake geek girl concept inspired the geek girls are real project.
322480	328240	This is a very long, very boring article about how women who are into comic books
328240	331920	and movies and video games and other things that generally only men
331920	333920	would have been into in the early 90s.
333920	335440	Well, they do actually exist.
335440	336080	And you know what?
336640	337120	Yeah, I know.
337680	338640	I think we all know.
338640	340800	When I was young, they were quite rare.
340800	343040	You know, nearly every boy played video games at some point,
343040	344560	but the number of girls who played video games,
344560	347040	you can count on one hand in my town, at least when I was a kid.
347040	349360	But nowadays, you know, gamer girls are everywhere.
349360	350160	I'm dating one.
350160	354000	But this whole article talks like these fake gamer girls or whatever,
354000	356560	that they don't exist and the very concept of them is sexist.
356560	360080	And I'm just like, no, I've met them.
360080	364000	My best friend has actually been in the clutches of several of them
364000	365280	over the course of his life.
365280	369600	Like he ends up dating a girl because she talks about being very into video games.
369600	373840	And then after she's got her claws synced in, she's very clearly not into them at all.
373840	376960	And then it's like a multi-year project to get him away from her
376960	379040	because she's basically destroying his life.
379040	381840	I've seen that happen multiple times in my friend group.
381840	384240	You can't tell me this type of woman doesn't exist.
384240	387120	And this example isn't anything nerdy or related to video games,
387120	389120	but it's still the same example and you get my point.
389760	392880	This person here poses and says they want a photoshop done
392880	394320	and they're wearing a kiss t-shirt.
394320	398160	And then the person in the reply says, your five favorite kiss songs go.
398160	400480	Next reply is you're a moron lol.
400480	401440	Oh, you like music?
401440	402800	Name every song ever.
402800	403280	And you know what?
403280	403680	It's fair.
403680	407920	Like if you're part of a demographic that doesn't necessarily normally like something,
407920	411120	but you actually like it, then you get quizzed on it constantly
411120	413680	because people think that you're being a fake fan for attention
413680	417120	or trying to get a guy or just to get some kind of social clout or whatever.
417120	418880	I can see how that'd be really annoying.
418880	421520	At the same time, there are women who do this.
421520	422960	There are men who do this.
422960	428000	Like how many times has a man lied to get into a girl's pants?
428000	431440	At least in hookup culture, that seems to happen quite a bit, doesn't it?
431440	433360	And here's a funny little comic about the same thing.
433360	435280	You know, there's a nerd girl here who likes an anime
435280	436480	and she ends up getting quizzed by the guy
436480	439440	and then she reveals her power level at the end of the comic, you know?
439440	441600	And it's like black women like anime.
441600	443280	Stop quizzing women on nerd stuff.
443280	448560	But then the other point of view is that guys don't just quiz nerdy women on this stuff.
448560	450560	They quiz each other all the time.
450560	455360	Nerdy guys definitely have nerd offs or they get into in-depth discussions
455360	458480	about the things that they're very, very passionate about.
458480	462160	But it seems to be only the women that take it as a personal attack
462720	466960	that their interests are, well, being taken interest in.
467520	470160	Aside from just a surface level of that's cool.
470240	474880	If this is something that happens to guys regularly in these spaces and no one bats an eye,
474880	478640	you can't suddenly call it sexist because it also happens to women when they show up.
478640	483440	And I do mean when they show up, because there's definitely a shared suffering
483440	487520	that seems to go with being a gamer or being a nerdy guy.
488080	491840	At least if you're my age, maybe not so much if you're like a teenager nowadays,
491840	494080	because I think that's thankfully been weeded out.
494080	496000	And you know what? It's a good thing it's been done away with.
496000	500000	But when I was a kid, even though most boys had played video games,
500000	502480	the ones that were really into them, they were the nerds.
503760	505040	And they were the ones that were bullied.
505040	507040	They were bullied by the girls and they were bullied by the guys.
507680	511840	And so when you had your little clique of video game loving friends,
511840	513840	you did have to self police a little bit.
513840	517280	You know, there was definitely like a loneliness and an introversion
517280	522160	and almost a type of victimhood that being a gamer, at least when I was a kid, came with.
522160	525120	You know, now I'm starting to sound like, you know, gamers rise up.
525120	528160	The Joker movie was our Bible in cells, the whole thing.
528160	529760	Right. And that's not where I'm going with this.
530080	535200	But if you don't think that at one point in time, maybe that Super Nintendo or whatever,
535200	539680	back in their basement was their only source of solace to get them through the school years.
540320	544240	If you don't think that happened, then it seems like you don't understand the,
544240	549200	to use a social justice term, lived experiences of a lot of young men.
549200	551840	And at some point, and I'm not sure when this happened, but at some point
552800	555920	that suffering became part of the identity.
555920	559840	These are older memes, but they do check out and they definitely tell a story.
560000	564800	A story of what these guys had to do to basically get by, at least when they were younger.
565360	566400	And you know what?
566400	569600	Some of them are unfortunate enough that they're still doing it now,
570560	572240	but there's a shared suffering in it.
572240	575680	I recall quite vividly to be a gamer in the early nineties.
575680	579280	You couldn't simply just play video games, though that was the primary thing you had to do.
579840	585280	There was also this idea of, well, I got bullied and all my friends got bullied.
585280	590800	And those people who are growing up now playing video games and not getting bullied for it.
590800	595440	Yeah, they've got a better time of it, but they also don't understand how good they have it.
595440	601600	It almost feels like they're taking that gamer status or that nerd status and they're running
601600	605200	with it without suffering to get it the way that we had to.
605200	606240	And you know what?
606240	610080	There's definitely a feeling like this among the LGBT crowd as well.
610160	612800	Gay teens and lesbian teens growing up now
613360	617840	do not have to suffer nearly as much as they did when I was in school.
617840	620320	That's obviously a good thing at the same time.
620320	624800	However, if being discriminated against is part of your LGBT identity,
624800	628160	then what do you do when LGBT people appear
628160	631440	that have not actually experienced being discriminated against?
631440	631940	I don't know.
632480	634240	Maybe that's where radicalism comes from.
634240	637760	Maybe that's where inter-movement conflict comes from.
637760	638560	I'm not sure.
638560	644080	But my point is, it's not simply sexism when guys try to weed out the fake gamer girls
644080	644960	because they exist.
644960	646320	They can ruin friendships.
646320	647760	They can ruin people.
647760	649280	And I'm not saying this is unique to women.
649280	650640	Men ruin women all the time.
650640	653360	But this is one of the ways in which women do it to men.
653360	656560	And so they know this and they focus on it.
656560	660720	And this all relates back to the consumer because the consumer
661280	663600	seems to have completely forgotten that this is the case.
663600	668000	They don't consider their hobby to be a unified community.
668000	670960	They consider it to be a political activist movement.
670960	674640	And that's why to them, weeding out potentially toxic people
675200	678400	is considered to be gatekeeping, especially if that person's a woman.
678400	681200	And I want to make it absolutely clear, I'm talking very broad strokes here.
681760	685440	Obviously, there are women involved in video games even before I was born,
685440	688320	but those were definitely the exception and not the rule.
688320	691440	Yes, women have been involved in the creation of comic books since then.
692000	694800	Yes, women have been involved in the creation of comic books,
694800	698160	of science fiction, of movies, of video games,
698160	700320	since the inception of all of these mediums.
700320	702880	But again, exception, not the rule.
702880	704720	This image is from long before gamer game.
704720	705920	However, it's definitely still relevant.
705920	708880	Could probably use some updating just to at least add some new years on it.
708880	711440	A history of women and video games throughout the years.
711440	716400	From 95 to 2005, LOL look at the loser in his video games.
716400	717040	Yeah, pretty much.
717840	720560	And then, why won't anyone give me attention?
721120	722640	The cake is a lie XD.
722640	727840	So that's them trying to spout off the most surface level memes to try and get into the group.
728480	729920	Girls can play games too, you know.
730480	732160	I'm a girl gamer.
732160	733840	Girls are just as good as guys, pretty much.
734560	737680	And like, up until this point, things are fine.
737680	740240	You want in, you want to play video games, that's fine.
740240	741200	Go ahead and play them.
741200	743280	If you want into a pre-established community,
743280	746960	follow the pre-established rules of that pre-established community and you're golden.
746960	747680	It's fine.
747680	752480	But then suddenly, video games are sexist and video games must cater to our needs.
752560	756640	All of this is pretty much exemplified by the oh no comic.
756640	758080	You do not fit in here.
758080	759840	Okay, we will make our own place.
759840	760960	Why are you excluding us?
760960	764000	Oh no, that is pretty much how it works.
764000	767920	It's tough being a pariah, even in a minor sense, like just socially or something.
768480	771520	But it also means that you're outside the bounds of the culture,
771520	775600	so you can discover new things, invent new things, create your own place.
775600	779920	But the consumer is somebody who has taken that status,
779920	782000	and they've probably legitimately earned it.
782080	784320	Throughout their own lifetime of experiences.
784320	785760	And they've turned it political.
785760	788880	And they've twisted it away from what it was once all about.
789680	796080	Which was the game or the movie, the passion, the hobby, the human connection, the fun.
796080	797360	And now it's all about politics.
797920	801760	Now it's all about support Ghostbusters 2016 or else you're a bigot.
801760	805360	Now it's all about only incel dude bros liking Joker.
805360	811600	We have finally managed to consistently and effectively commoditize human passion.
811600	816160	Only it didn't come from the hyper corporatist right-wing of politics
816160	819440	like frankly I thought it would, but it came from the left.
819440	824480	It came from the left in their all-encompassing desire to win the culture war
