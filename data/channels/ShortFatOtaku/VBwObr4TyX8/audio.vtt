00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
You know, the notion that people must buy a product to defeat their cultural enemies,

00:05.120 --> 00:08.800
regardless of the product's quality or their personal enjoyment of it,

00:08.800 --> 00:12.160
is probably the greatest marketing gimmick ever conceived.

00:12.160 --> 00:17.360
And really, regardless of the political slant of the product itself, or its audience,

00:17.360 --> 00:21.520
everyone's doing this sort of thing now. I mean, it takes no time at all to hop on the internet

00:21.520 --> 00:26.640
and find at least somebody who's angry about Joker getting a whole bunch of Oscar nominations,

00:26.640 --> 00:31.520
considering how baselessly demonized and vilified that product was.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.280
And even though it wasn't an incel movie,

00:33.280 --> 00:38.160
the incel community did definitely embrace it and kind of push it as its own.

00:38.160 --> 00:42.000
On the flip side of that, we have something like Ghostbusters 2016,

00:42.000 --> 00:47.040
which was so bad that the next Ghostbusters movie is going to completely skip it

00:47.040 --> 00:49.520
and continue from the original Ghostbusters canon.

00:49.520 --> 00:53.120
People like AVGN, who's generally pretty apolitical,

00:53.120 --> 00:54.960
even he came out and said,

00:54.960 --> 01:00.960
no, I refuse, and received a massive backlash as being this hateful gamer man baby,

01:00.960 --> 01:04.240
even though that's probably the single most inaccurate description of James Rolfe

01:04.240 --> 01:07.360
that I've ever heard, regardless of what character he might play on the internet.

01:07.360 --> 01:12.640
But despite the movie being a complete pile of shit and also being a financial failure,

01:12.640 --> 01:17.680
people online, even to this day, still defend it because, hey, it's part of their team.

01:17.680 --> 01:21.040
Ghostbusters 2016 was a glorious gift to fans.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.200
And the new director is a bitter dude, bro,

01:23.200 --> 01:26.480
who's going to make a steaming pile of shit and call it a masterpiece.

01:26.480 --> 01:27.440
This is the thing.

01:27.440 --> 01:28.960
It wasn't a glorious gift to fans.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.720
It was a glorious gift to you.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.880
Maybe you were a fan of the original Ghostbusters.

01:32.880 --> 01:33.600
Who knows?

01:33.600 --> 01:36.000
But very clearly, most of the fans didn't like it.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.040
They didn't watch it.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.480
It made no money.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.080
People voted with their wallets.

01:40.080 --> 01:42.240
But more than that, see what this person's done?

01:42.880 --> 01:44.880
At least in terms of this conversation,

01:44.880 --> 01:48.880
they've pinned it all on the fact that this movie had to be a success.

01:48.880 --> 01:53.120
Now, unless she has stock in the production company or something, it actually doesn't matter.

01:53.120 --> 01:56.160
It doesn't matter to me if I like a movie that no one else likes.

01:56.160 --> 01:57.440
I can still like that movie.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.840
I can still go and rewatch it whenever I like.

01:59.840 --> 02:02.480
It isn't, or at least it shouldn't be,

02:02.480 --> 02:07.360
a social or political statement to just enjoy the media that you like.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.880
But that's what it is nowadays, because everything's political.

02:10.880 --> 02:16.720
And if a movie or a TV series or a game or whatever becomes a financial success

02:16.720 --> 02:19.040
and it also pushes your politics,

02:19.040 --> 02:22.480
then that is one step closer to victory and the great culture war.

02:22.480 --> 02:27.040
But more importantly, it means that you can't ever simply sit down

02:27.040 --> 02:29.200
and enjoy something on its merits.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.040
You're always looking at it through a lens.

02:31.040 --> 02:32.960
And frankly, it becomes kind of tiring.

02:32.960 --> 02:35.440
I think this attitude can best be summed up by this next clip.

02:35.440 --> 02:36.240
And you know what?

02:36.240 --> 02:38.000
You probably know what I'm going to play.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.680
In fact, here, here, pause the video, put in the timestamp,

02:41.680 --> 02:44.800
this timestamp right now where you paused it, and then tell me in the comments,

02:44.800 --> 02:47.680
what clip do you think I'm about to play at this timestamp?

02:47.680 --> 02:49.040
Come on, be honest.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.480
I don't want anyone cheating.

02:50.480 --> 02:51.760
But yeah, here we go.

02:53.360 --> 02:54.720
Don't ask questions.

02:54.720 --> 02:58.320
Just consume product and then get excited for next products.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.840
Of course, of course.

02:59.840 --> 03:03.680
But here's the ideological reason why that meme has received such backlash.

03:04.480 --> 03:07.920
If someone posts this, what they really mean is,

03:07.920 --> 03:11.200
I hate if there's women and minorities in my movies.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.960
That's actually not what they said.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.040
And it's actually not what they're complaining about.

03:15.040 --> 03:20.720
But because to you, consumerism is just another wing in the culture war.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.000
That's how you view it.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.120
When somebody has a legitimate complaint against a movie or whatever,

03:25.120 --> 03:26.320
it's no longer legitimate to you.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.120
It's just politics.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.280
It all gets boiled down to politics.

03:29.280 --> 03:33.200
The quality of these things doesn't actually matter, just the power behind it all.

03:33.280 --> 03:39.680
Which is why I absolutely love the fact that the caricature of this consuming culture warrior

03:40.400 --> 03:44.240
has been immortalized in the face of my dear friend, Moviebob.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.960
The 38 year old consumer.

03:47.520 --> 03:51.360
This is probably the funniest Wojak that has ever been made out of all Wojaks,

03:51.360 --> 03:52.880
to be honest, at least to me anyway.

03:52.880 --> 03:56.000
I know it's meant to be like a meme and you could like map it onto other people,

03:56.000 --> 03:59.120
but this really does hit home with Moviebob specifically, doesn't it?

03:59.120 --> 04:02.640
I mean, he's definitely one of those failed that guy with the glasses type.

04:03.040 --> 04:06.320
So he definitely prioritizes his video reviews on YouTube,

04:06.320 --> 04:10.080
even as he talks about the progressive communist ethnostate in space

04:10.080 --> 04:14.080
and how he should be roaming the stars right now if it weren't for those rednecks.

04:14.080 --> 04:17.760
However, there's definitely something to this here regarding political views

04:17.760 --> 04:20.880
focused around being vindictive towards people who were mean to him in high school.

04:20.880 --> 04:25.520
It's kind of strange because the radical left seems to be made up of two types of people.

04:25.520 --> 04:30.160
Generally, you have the people who are victimized by bullies in high school

04:30.800 --> 04:33.840
and they have since become middle class, like insufferable middle class,

04:33.840 --> 04:36.160
almost like they're Karens or wine moms or something.

04:36.160 --> 04:39.920
And so basically they're bougie socialists who are looking for a way to be a victim,

04:39.920 --> 04:41.680
even though they're straight and white.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.440
So they talk about the rich all the time,

04:43.440 --> 04:46.080
you know, the people who actually made it somewhere through their own hard work.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.560
Then the other half are the bullies themselves.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.560
They also end up falling into this camp as well.

04:50.560 --> 04:53.280
These would be like the Zoe Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian types.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.920
You can tell that these people back in school,

04:55.920 --> 04:58.320
they were probably like the queen bitch of the playground,

04:58.320 --> 04:59.760
bullying and making fun of people.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.400
And now those same nerds and gamers that they've bullied,

05:02.400 --> 05:04.880
they've come back with in their 20s and 30s to fuck with

05:04.880 --> 05:07.280
on either the political stage or on the media stage.

05:07.280 --> 05:10.240
And you'll notice that I talked about primarily women in those two examples,

05:10.240 --> 05:12.080
and that's for a specific reason.

05:12.080 --> 05:13.680
And no, it's not misogyny.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.760
You get articles like this, for example,

05:15.760 --> 05:17.680
We're not unicorns, we exist.

05:17.680 --> 05:22.480
How the fake geek girl concept inspired the geek girls are real project.

05:22.480 --> 05:28.240
This is a very long, very boring article about how women who are into comic books

05:28.240 --> 05:31.920
and movies and video games and other things that generally only men

05:31.920 --> 05:33.920
would have been into in the early 90s.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.440
Well, they do actually exist.

05:35.440 --> 05:36.080
And you know what?

05:36.640 --> 05:37.120
Yeah, I know.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.640
I think we all know.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.800
When I was young, they were quite rare.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.040
You know, nearly every boy played video games at some point,

05:43.040 --> 05:44.560
but the number of girls who played video games,

05:44.560 --> 05:47.040
you can count on one hand in my town, at least when I was a kid.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.360
But nowadays, you know, gamer girls are everywhere.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.160
I'm dating one.

05:50.160 --> 05:54.000
But this whole article talks like these fake gamer girls or whatever,

05:54.000 --> 05:56.560
that they don't exist and the very concept of them is sexist.

05:56.560 --> 06:00.080
And I'm just like, no, I've met them.

06:00.080 --> 06:04.000
My best friend has actually been in the clutches of several of them

06:04.000 --> 06:05.280
over the course of his life.

06:05.280 --> 06:09.600
Like he ends up dating a girl because she talks about being very into video games.

06:09.600 --> 06:13.840
And then after she's got her claws synced in, she's very clearly not into them at all.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.960
And then it's like a multi-year project to get him away from her

06:16.960 --> 06:19.040
because she's basically destroying his life.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.840
I've seen that happen multiple times in my friend group.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.240
You can't tell me this type of woman doesn't exist.

06:24.240 --> 06:27.120
And this example isn't anything nerdy or related to video games,

06:27.120 --> 06:29.120
but it's still the same example and you get my point.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.880
This person here poses and says they want a photoshop done

06:32.880 --> 06:34.320
and they're wearing a kiss t-shirt.

06:34.320 --> 06:38.160
And then the person in the reply says, your five favorite kiss songs go.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.480
Next reply is you're a moron lol.

06:40.480 --> 06:41.440
Oh, you like music?

06:41.440 --> 06:42.800
Name every song ever.

06:42.800 --> 06:43.280
And you know what?

06:43.280 --> 06:43.680
It's fair.

06:43.680 --> 06:47.920
Like if you're part of a demographic that doesn't necessarily normally like something,

06:47.920 --> 06:51.120
but you actually like it, then you get quizzed on it constantly

06:51.120 --> 06:53.680
because people think that you're being a fake fan for attention

06:53.680 --> 06:57.120
or trying to get a guy or just to get some kind of social clout or whatever.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.880
I can see how that'd be really annoying.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.520
At the same time, there are women who do this.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.960
There are men who do this.

07:02.960 --> 07:08.000
Like how many times has a man lied to get into a girl's pants?

07:08.000 --> 07:11.440
At least in hookup culture, that seems to happen quite a bit, doesn't it?

07:11.440 --> 07:13.360
And here's a funny little comic about the same thing.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.280
You know, there's a nerd girl here who likes an anime

07:15.280 --> 07:16.480
and she ends up getting quizzed by the guy

07:16.480 --> 07:19.440
and then she reveals her power level at the end of the comic, you know?

07:19.440 --> 07:21.600
And it's like black women like anime.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.280
Stop quizzing women on nerd stuff.

07:23.280 --> 07:28.560
But then the other point of view is that guys don't just quiz nerdy women on this stuff.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.560
They quiz each other all the time.

07:30.560 --> 07:35.360
Nerdy guys definitely have nerd offs or they get into in-depth discussions

07:35.360 --> 07:38.480
about the things that they're very, very passionate about.

07:38.480 --> 07:42.160
But it seems to be only the women that take it as a personal attack

07:42.720 --> 07:46.960
that their interests are, well, being taken interest in.

07:47.520 --> 07:50.160
Aside from just a surface level of that's cool.

07:50.240 --> 07:54.880
If this is something that happens to guys regularly in these spaces and no one bats an eye,

07:54.880 --> 07:58.640
you can't suddenly call it sexist because it also happens to women when they show up.

07:58.640 --> 08:03.440
And I do mean when they show up, because there's definitely a shared suffering

08:03.440 --> 08:07.520
that seems to go with being a gamer or being a nerdy guy.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.840
At least if you're my age, maybe not so much if you're like a teenager nowadays,

08:11.840 --> 08:14.080
because I think that's thankfully been weeded out.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.000
And you know what? It's a good thing it's been done away with.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
But when I was a kid, even though most boys had played video games,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.480
the ones that were really into them, they were the nerds.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.040
And they were the ones that were bullied.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.040
They were bullied by the girls and they were bullied by the guys.

08:27.680 --> 08:31.840
And so when you had your little clique of video game loving friends,

08:31.840 --> 08:33.840
you did have to self police a little bit.

08:33.840 --> 08:37.280
You know, there was definitely like a loneliness and an introversion

08:37.280 --> 08:42.160
and almost a type of victimhood that being a gamer, at least when I was a kid, came with.

08:42.160 --> 08:45.120
You know, now I'm starting to sound like, you know, gamers rise up.

08:45.120 --> 08:48.160
The Joker movie was our Bible in cells, the whole thing.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.760
Right. And that's not where I'm going with this.

08:50.080 --> 08:55.200
But if you don't think that at one point in time, maybe that Super Nintendo or whatever,

08:55.200 --> 08:59.680
back in their basement was their only source of solace to get them through the school years.

09:00.320 --> 09:04.240
If you don't think that happened, then it seems like you don't understand the,

09:04.240 --> 09:09.200
to use a social justice term, lived experiences of a lot of young men.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.840
And at some point, and I'm not sure when this happened, but at some point

09:12.800 --> 09:15.920
that suffering became part of the identity.

09:15.920 --> 09:19.840
These are older memes, but they do check out and they definitely tell a story.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.800
A story of what these guys had to do to basically get by, at least when they were younger.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.400
And you know what?

09:26.400 --> 09:29.600
Some of them are unfortunate enough that they're still doing it now,

09:30.560 --> 09:32.240
but there's a shared suffering in it.

09:32.240 --> 09:35.680
I recall quite vividly to be a gamer in the early nineties.

09:35.680 --> 09:39.280
You couldn't simply just play video games, though that was the primary thing you had to do.

09:39.840 --> 09:45.280
There was also this idea of, well, I got bullied and all my friends got bullied.

09:45.280 --> 09:50.800
And those people who are growing up now playing video games and not getting bullied for it.

09:50.800 --> 09:55.440
Yeah, they've got a better time of it, but they also don't understand how good they have it.

09:55.440 --> 10:01.600
It almost feels like they're taking that gamer status or that nerd status and they're running

10:01.600 --> 10:05.200
with it without suffering to get it the way that we had to.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.240
And you know what?

10:06.240 --> 10:10.080
There's definitely a feeling like this among the LGBT crowd as well.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.800
Gay teens and lesbian teens growing up now

10:13.360 --> 10:17.840
do not have to suffer nearly as much as they did when I was in school.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.320
That's obviously a good thing at the same time.

10:20.320 --> 10:24.800
However, if being discriminated against is part of your LGBT identity,

10:24.800 --> 10:28.160
then what do you do when LGBT people appear

10:28.160 --> 10:31.440
that have not actually experienced being discriminated against?

10:31.440 --> 10:31.940
I don't know.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.240
Maybe that's where radicalism comes from.

10:34.240 --> 10:37.760
Maybe that's where inter-movement conflict comes from.

10:37.760 --> 10:38.560
I'm not sure.

10:38.560 --> 10:44.080
But my point is, it's not simply sexism when guys try to weed out the fake gamer girls

10:44.080 --> 10:44.960
because they exist.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.320
They can ruin friendships.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.760
They can ruin people.

10:47.760 --> 10:49.280
And I'm not saying this is unique to women.

10:49.280 --> 10:50.640
Men ruin women all the time.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.360
But this is one of the ways in which women do it to men.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.560
And so they know this and they focus on it.

10:56.560 --> 11:00.720
And this all relates back to the consumer because the consumer

11:01.280 --> 11:03.600
seems to have completely forgotten that this is the case.

11:03.600 --> 11:08.000
They don't consider their hobby to be a unified community.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.960
They consider it to be a political activist movement.

11:10.960 --> 11:14.640
And that's why to them, weeding out potentially toxic people

11:15.200 --> 11:18.400
is considered to be gatekeeping, especially if that person's a woman.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.200
And I want to make it absolutely clear, I'm talking very broad strokes here.

11:21.760 --> 11:25.440
Obviously, there are women involved in video games even before I was born,

11:25.440 --> 11:28.320
but those were definitely the exception and not the rule.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.440
Yes, women have been involved in the creation of comic books since then.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.800
Yes, women have been involved in the creation of comic books,

11:34.800 --> 11:38.160
of science fiction, of movies, of video games,

11:38.160 --> 11:40.320
since the inception of all of these mediums.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.880
But again, exception, not the rule.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.720
This image is from long before gamer game.

11:44.720 --> 11:45.920
However, it's definitely still relevant.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.880
Could probably use some updating just to at least add some new years on it.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.440
A history of women and video games throughout the years.

11:51.440 --> 11:56.400
From 95 to 2005, LOL look at the loser in his video games.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.040
Yeah, pretty much.

11:57.840 --> 12:00.560
And then, why won't anyone give me attention?

12:01.120 --> 12:02.640
The cake is a lie XD.

12:02.640 --> 12:07.840
So that's them trying to spout off the most surface level memes to try and get into the group.

12:08.480 --> 12:09.920
Girls can play games too, you know.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.160
I'm a girl gamer.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.840
Girls are just as good as guys, pretty much.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.680
And like, up until this point, things are fine.

12:17.680 --> 12:20.240
You want in, you want to play video games, that's fine.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.200
Go ahead and play them.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.280
If you want into a pre-established community,

12:23.280 --> 12:26.960
follow the pre-established rules of that pre-established community and you're golden.

12:26.960 --> 12:27.680
It's fine.

12:27.680 --> 12:32.480
But then suddenly, video games are sexist and video games must cater to our needs.

12:32.560 --> 12:36.640
All of this is pretty much exemplified by the oh no comic.

12:36.640 --> 12:38.080
You do not fit in here.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.840
Okay, we will make our own place.

12:39.840 --> 12:40.960
Why are you excluding us?

12:40.960 --> 12:44.000
Oh no, that is pretty much how it works.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.920
It's tough being a pariah, even in a minor sense, like just socially or something.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.520
But it also means that you're outside the bounds of the culture,

12:51.520 --> 12:55.600
so you can discover new things, invent new things, create your own place.

12:55.600 --> 12:59.920
But the consumer is somebody who has taken that status,

12:59.920 --> 13:02.000
and they've probably legitimately earned it.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.320
Throughout their own lifetime of experiences.

13:04.320 --> 13:05.760
And they've turned it political.

13:05.760 --> 13:08.880
And they've twisted it away from what it was once all about.

13:09.680 --> 13:16.080
Which was the game or the movie, the passion, the hobby, the human connection, the fun.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.360
And now it's all about politics.

13:17.920 --> 13:21.760
Now it's all about support Ghostbusters 2016 or else you're a bigot.

13:21.760 --> 13:25.360
Now it's all about only incel dude bros liking Joker.

13:25.360 --> 13:31.600
We have finally managed to consistently and effectively commoditize human passion.

13:31.600 --> 13:36.160
Only it didn't come from the hyper corporatist right-wing of politics

13:36.160 --> 13:39.440
like frankly I thought it would, but it came from the left.

13:39.440 --> 13:44.480
It came from the left in their all-encompassing desire to win the culture war

13:45.120 --> 13:47.840
and wield the power that comes with that victory.

13:47.840 --> 13:51.040
So it doesn't matter how bad Captain Marvel 2 is going to be.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.680
You have to buy those movie tickets to defeat the alt-right.

13:53.680 --> 13:57.120
You don't have to enjoy that movie, you just have to consume it.
