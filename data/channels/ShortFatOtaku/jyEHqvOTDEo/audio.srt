1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
As you can see by that timer on the screen, the Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,680
comes out in 45 seconds.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,680
Are you guys ready?

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,680
No.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,680
We can't wait.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,680
This is good.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,120
And I say that with a full sarcasm.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,200
I'm here with Lilith and Arch and Kibs.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,200
Hello everyone.

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,200
How's it going?

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,200
Hello everyone.

12
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,480
Arch and Kibs.

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,280
So last night I watched the Fellowship of the Ring extended edition with Naomi just

14
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,160
to have like a taste of something good before I knew this was going to come out.

15
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,320
And you know what?

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,320
It still holds up.

17
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,580
It's a bit goofy in that 1999 way, but it still holds up generally.

18
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,580
You know what I mean?

19
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,880
It's going to be a classic probably for all time, honestly.

20
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,920
Peter Jackson did a good job with those movies.

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,880
The first three are just always going to be like the Lord of the Rings movies.

22
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
Yeah.

23
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,120
Before the movies, I actually really wasn't that interested in Lord of the Rings.

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,680
I became interested in it after.

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:07,480
In fact, my first Lord of the Rings experience was that god-awful Super Nintendo game, which

26
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,680
turned me off of the entire franchise for like a decade.

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
Damn.

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
I don't even know what game you're talking about.

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,500
Why is there an animated series?

30
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,880
The fucking animated movies.

31
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,800
Oh yeah.

32
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,600
They're definitely products of their time because the style is ancient, but they are

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,600
one-of-a-kind movies.

34
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,520
I forget the name of the animator who did that.

35
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,120
I remember being super scared of Sauron as a kid.

36
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:43,960
Like when Sauron came on, my eyes would just be fixed like, oh, he's looking at me.

37
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,960
Well now he's M&M.

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,600
That might be a priest of Melkor.

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Maybe.

40
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
We'll see.

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,840
There's conflicting stuff about it, but if that's what Sauron looks like, I'm going to

42
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
lose my shit.

43
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,920
At some point, I'll have to do like an actual proper video about this show.

44
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,600
This is just going to be like our series debut watch party since we're all hanging out tonight

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,900
and watching it.

46
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,760
But I mean, there's been so much stuff coming out about just how bad the show looks, how

47
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,680
the costumes are shit.

48
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,560
Apparently the intro looks like it's something out of a daytime soap opera.

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,480
It's a drastic variation in color.

50
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,480
Right.

51
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,560
I've seen the intro.

52
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,040
It looks like a complete joke.

53
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,800
Are we going to watch like some step wives slapping each other?

54
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Nice.

55
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
What's going on here?

56
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,960
Dude, if you could have two elven wives, wouldn't you?

57
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,960
Elves are for enslaving.

58
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,900
They're going to get canceled.

59
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,760
It's the variation in the quality that I think has stood out the most to a lot of people

60
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,480
because some of the gear does not look bad.

61
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,280
Like Galadriel's plate armor looks like plate armor.

62
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,800
She shouldn't be wearing it, but beyond that.

63
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,180
And then you've got that lamellar style armor that the Numenoreans wear, which looks like

64
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,480
some kind of a t-shirt with a scale male pattern painted onto it.

65
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,480
Oh, I saw that.

66
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
Yeah.

67
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,480
I don't get it.

68
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,480
Why does it look like cheap?

69
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,360
This is like an Amazon Prime show, isn't it right?

70
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,720
Like you would imagine they have lots of lots of money.

71
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,760
You would think they'd be able to afford to pay the say custom designers a little more.

72
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,160
You definitely think, yeah.

73
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,640
But the one thing I will say, you could definitely tell, at least from the trailer, the hand-picked

74
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,520
CGI scenes, like there was a serious amount of effort and money put into those.

75
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,760
When they're like, here's the trailer shots that will make everyone want to watch this.

76
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,680
There's a bunch of CG and then a bunch of characters that just look really cringy.

77
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,840
Yeah, the character designs are bad.

78
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,360
The CGI scene shots don't look half bad.

79
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,320
Yeah, we're going to have to see how this all comes together, and I'm a little bit skeptical

80
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,640
about this whole show.

81
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,440
I think it's just going to be a train wreck, honestly.

82
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,040
Hopefully it'll be a fun train wreck.

83
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,040
I'm hoping in mind, maybe.

84
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:05,160
I'm hoping it won't be as bad as everybody's is, but it probably will be in all that likelihood.

85
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,000
If it is, okay, if this is a train wreck, it's going to be a train wreck that we're

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,320
going to have to live with for five seasons because they've already ordered five seasons

87
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
of it.

88
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,080
I can't, like if it's bombs, they're going to cancel it.

89
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,080
I hope to God.

90
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,440
This is the survival of Amazon Studios on the line.

91
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,800
This will not be canceled.

92
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,320
They will push this turd almost no matter what.

93
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:36,680
Well, there was one that basically said that this will determine prime video going forward.

94
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,560
There's the meme of everyone saying, no fucking hate watching.

95
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
Sorry, guys.

96
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,240
We're doing it so that you don't have to, okay?

97
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,280
We'll do it because we're the YouTubers, okay?

98
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,960
You guys, no fucking hate watching out there, all right?

99
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,840
Yeah.

100
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,840
Special exception for us because we're part of the elite now.

101
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,680
Dev laughs, but he's like, yeah, that's true.

102
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
We are the new bourgeois.

103
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,040
It doesn't work.

104
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:07,400
Not like refusing to watch it isn't going to work because we make up 0.0000% of Amazon's

105
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,080
market cap here.

106
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,480
That's not going to make a difference.

107
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,680
Us watching it and honestly reviewing it will.

108
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,400
Yeah, it's true because people will see the review and then be like, oh, well, this sucks.

109
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,320
And then if you have 10,000 of those or 100,000 bad reviews, that does add up.

110
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,840
You have the Gronton Tomato scores and stuff.

111
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,880
Those 100,000 bad reviews is far more powerful than 100,000 people who didn't watch it.

112
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,840
That's one of the reasons why I felt compelled to do the Kenobi video, even though it was

113
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,880
kind of a little bit old by the time I did it, I was like, you know what?

114
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,560
I should try my hand at doing this sort of thing.

115
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,120
So Kibs, Kibs is the one controlling the video feed.

116
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,440
We're already 10 minutes behind.

117
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
You're ready?

118
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,440
Kibs, Twitter already knows about this.

119
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,960
Kibs, I'm letting you Twitter already knows we have to catch up if you have to be involved

120
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
in the newest thing.

121
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,160
I have to get I have to figure out how this works even because it's like the episodes

122
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,160
are out.

123
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,280
There it is.

124
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
They just came out.

125
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,040
Let's watch this shit.

126
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Here we go.

127
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,040
It's starting.

128
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,020
I also have the pleasure to announce that the episodes are already up on the torrent

129
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,520
sites as well.

130
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:16,080
So if you don't want to support Prime, I'm not suggesting alternatives.

131
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,480
You can hate watch on the seven seas, so to speak.

132
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,280
You're her fidgety.

133
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,560
Nothing is evil in the beginning.

134
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,160
This is how Google began.

135
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,160
Nothing's evil in the beginning.

136
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,160
But even then, there was light.

137
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,160
You mean our Mary Sue?

138
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,160
Even you could have possibly believed there was a scrapbook float.

139
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,040
It's not going to float.

140
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,760
I hate how the elves are just people.

141
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Are these elves?

142
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,760
Wait, I can't even tell.

143
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,020
They've got like regular ears.

144
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,020
You show them.

145
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,020
They're slightly pointy.

146
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,020
Like, look, they're slightly pointy.

147
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,020
Yeah, she's an elf.

148
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,020
Yeah, I guess.

149
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,020
Oh, my God.

150
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,020
It's a little fucking spawn.

151
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,020
Whee!

152
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,240
Oh, it's a magic origami.

153
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,080
Galadriel made a magic spawn.

154
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,520
Oh, evil toxic masculinity.

155
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,800
Toxic fucking white boy males at it again.

156
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,400
Wow, this story is already really bad.

157
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,080
These are elves.

158
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,160
They look like people.

159
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,400
They speak like people.

160
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Like humans.

161
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
What the fuck?

162
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,100
Yeah, the ears aren't pointed enough, you know?

163
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,480
It's the way they shoot it, too.

164
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,800
The way they did it in the movies was actually brilliant.

165
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,320
It gave them an in the luminescence.

166
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,600
Yeah, they kind of glowed.

167
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:42,320
You know, at this point, I think I preferred the three long pointed ears, like a foot long.

168
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,520
You see those in Warcraft's highlighters?

169
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,840
This guy's barely got pointed ears at all.

170
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,100
Also, they should not be talking about darkness.

171
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,360
This is the first age.

172
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,280
They don't even know darkness exists yet.

173
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,560
Ah, that's that's her brother, isn't it, Finrod?

174
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
If I had to guess, yes.

175
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,880
But you must learn to discern them for yourself.

176
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,560
I won't always be here to speak them to you.

177
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,360
Oh, no.

178
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,080
Come along.

179
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,080
Foreshadowing much?

180
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,280
God, this is really bad.

181
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,000
Death flags abound.

182
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,080
We have two death flags on them already.

183
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,920
Nice and subtle.

184
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:28,500
The symbolism of him walking away over the horizon and she not following and her crying.

185
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,280
And she's talking about death.

186
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,880
Oh my God, Story, can you stop?

187
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,440
The two whatchama doozies, I forget their names.

188
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
The Elden Ringtrees.

189
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,880
Oh, doing a bit of a time skip, I see.

190
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
Just a bit.

191
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
Oh, my Jesus.

192
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
OK.

193
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
Yeah, we.

194
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
All right.

195
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,960
We're skipping to this part, fair enough.

196
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,280
How many how many years have we skipped now?

197
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Quite.

198
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,400
I think a thousand, maybe over now.

199
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:07,920
They're now basically pursuing Morgoth to recover the light of Valinor, a place known

200
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,080
as Middle Earth.

201
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
Oh, my God.

202
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,080
I clapped.

203
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
I clapped when I saw it.

204
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,040
Oh, God, I hate this shot.

205
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,000
You see, this helmet symbolizes dead soldiers.

206
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,720
Don't worry, it's not just that helmet.

207
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, here we go.

208
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,720
That's good stuff right there.

209
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,720
So what I shot, we did is collect all the helmets of the elves died.

210
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,920
It is the most unelven thing ever to just pile up those helmets of dead elven soldiers.

211
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,440
Hey, have you guys heard that orcs are black coated?

212
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,440
I don't know what you're talking about, Dev.

213
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,040
I don't want to get cancelled.

214
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,200
Oh, my God, we time skipped to his death even.

215
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,080
So how many years now?

216
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
How many years?

217
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,800
Honestly, we're in the thousands, and that's kind of all I know.

218
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,680
I think we're out of the first agent of the second now, aren't we?

219
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,360
Yeah, we're in the second age now.

220
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,600
So we skipped over the entire first stage.

221
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
That's good.

222
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,920
Because remember, Lord of the Rings takes place during the third age.

223
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,880
He became a girlboss.

224
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,040
Gaslight Gatekeep Girlboss.

225
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
Yes.

226
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,480
Galadriel is personally chasing us.

227
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,960
I assume she didn't originally do this, did she?

228
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,100
No.

229
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,800
Is it just me or is their voices really soft with the music overpowering?

230
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,520
That's been TV and movies for the past decade.

231
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,400
Look at how strong she is.

232
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,160
She's way ahead of everybody.

233
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,560
Of course, they're holding her back.

234
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:55,960
This was the show I was demonstrating.

235
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:01,400
Oh, the fuck boy is keeping the girlboss down?

236
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,600
He'll be wrong enough to apologize.

237
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Or die.

238
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,200
She doesn't care about her men, though.

239
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Jesus Christ.

240
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,440
Considering that I did just watch Fellowship, there was that scene where they were on the

241
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,200
mountain, and they were like, we have to turn back.

242
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
And then they did.

243
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Galadriel is far stronger than I.

244
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
That's abandoned.

245
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
She's gonna abandon her own men.

246
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
Feels like how empowered she is.

247
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
She's like, no, we keep moving.

248
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Oh, no.

249
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:36,680
My fucking bad command has gotten one of these elves, like, fucking badly injured.

250
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
But there it is.

251
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,400
She was right all along.

252
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,240
It's just Elsa's palace.

253
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,280
I hate these elves.

254
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,280
They're not elves.

255
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,280
They're not token elves, at least.

256
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,280
Galadriel just punched through an ice wolf the best.

257
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
Well, hold on.

258
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,080
I don't fully know this lore.

259
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,280
Do the elves have super strength like some elves do in this?

260
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,280
They are stronger than mortal men, if I remember right.

261
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Faster.

262
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,680
But not, not punching through a solid wall of ice with their fucking hands in two blows

263
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,120
Probably not that.

264
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Her girl energy makes that possible.

265
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,120
Girl energy?

266
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,120
See, we're in the second age now.

267
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,120
It's second wave elven feminism.

268
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,120
Don't worry, she's super smart and knows everything.

269
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,120
She's a special snowflake, in fact.

270
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,120
That's not how he works, but details.

271
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,120
According to Amazon, actually, it is.

272
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,560
According to Jeff Bezos.

273
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:49,560
Actually, Jeff Bezos said this isn't his fault.

274
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,560
The show.

275
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
Wait, what?

276
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,560
Yeah.

277
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
Apologize.

278
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,560
He apologized before the show started.

279
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,560
No way.

280
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,560
Yeah.

281
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
I'm sorry, guys.

282
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,560
That's hilarious of Joe.

283
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,560
Jeez.

284
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,560
Literally, what Lou had pointed out, the men are only holding her back.

285
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
They're constantly questioning.

286
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
There's something here.

287
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
He wasn't here.

288
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Can we go home and he's a bitch?

289
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm right.

290
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
He's always gotta be right.

291
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
As we'll probably see throughout the entire thing.

292
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
She's always right.

293
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I mean, she's already flawless.

294
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What has she done wrong?

295
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Even when she was a kid, she was perfect, but the children were holding her back.

296
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The white males were holding her back, really.

297
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
She...

298
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh, shit.

299
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You know, these guys aren't acting like elves, by the way.

300
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Bumbling around an ancient ruin like a bunch of muppets.

301
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
That's because she has to save them.

302
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,440
In a lot of stories, elves are just like humans with pointed ears.

303
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
Maybe they have more magic, maybe they're stronger.

304
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
Like Vulcans, basically, sometimes.

305
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Or like in Warcraft, they're just like other people.

306
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,440
But in Lord of the Rings, aren't they supposed to be like almost godlike?

307
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
Fine.

308
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Now, fastly superior to humans.

309
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
Yeah.

310
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,440
And the easy thing about you is an actual scene of a fucking human.

311
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
I love how right I was.

312
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
Christ.

313
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
She...

314
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,880
They couldn't do anything to it, but only she could.

315
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
Yep.

316
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
She's the only confident one of the bunch.

317
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
Also, I thought...

318
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880
I think she's such a bitch.

319
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Uh-oh.

320
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
The fuckboy's gonna say something.

321
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,880
Gotta hold the girlboss down.

322
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
All these white men holding her back.

323
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
Fucking white people, am I right?

324
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Are you...

325
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,880
Are you literally, like, laying down your arms?

326
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
No, serious...

327
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Oh, that's...

328
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
Ah, fuck me.

329
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,320
They laid down their arms before her feet like a bunch of fucking retard.

330
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,320
Right, so we're off to a horrific start.

331
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
Oh, god, is it the retarded people?

332
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,320
Yes, it is.

333
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Yes, it is.

334
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
Why do they have those?

335
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
Like the wind would blow them over.

336
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
Yes, it would.

337
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,320
I love the antler people.

338
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
Look at that.

339
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
What is that?

340
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
They just have giant antlers on their back.

341
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
Okay, so this was shown off early on.

342
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,760
Yeah, so these are like hunters, but they wear giant antlers for some reason.

343
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
And they just look retarded.

344
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
And they were like, look at the new Lord of the Rings.

345
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
And this is like the first picture they showed.

346
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,760
And these people, they just look so fucking stupid.

347
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,760
This is the early second age, they're talking about barstools?

348
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,760
These should be fucking neolithic savages.

349
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,760
I have to guess.

350
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,760
I would say they're like wearing the antlers to appear bigger to animals.

351
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,760
See, that's not wrong.

352
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,760
But like, that would scare away predators.

353
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
But you'd have a hard time hunting like that.

354
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Oh god, we have the harfoots.

355
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Oh no.

356
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Don't worry, we have a black one too.

357
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Don't ask me how.

358
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,200
So what are these guys?

359
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Are these guys just like Kokiri or something?

360
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Like primitive poppets.

361
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Yes, but Amazon can't call them hobbits because they don't have the rights to the hobbits.

362
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Wait, they actually don't?

363
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Really?

364
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Nope.

365
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
They don't.

366
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
That's why these are harfoots.

367
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
These aren't canon.

368
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Wait, hold on.

369
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Hold on.

370
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
It's pseudo.

371
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Wait a second.

372
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Explain this to me.

373
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,640
They've got access to the...

374
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,640
Oh god, what's the English word?

375
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
You know, the list of things that's in the book.

376
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
But they don't have anything to do with the actual Lord of the Rings books.

377
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
They've got like the summaries and stuff.

378
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
Oh, but not the actual main stories.

379
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,640
Okay.

380
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,640
No.

381
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,640
Which means that they don't actually own hobbit hobbits,

382
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
and so these aren't hobbits.

383
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,640
These are harfoots.

384
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
And that's why they've specifically said, Lenny Henry here in fact specifically said,

385
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
that the harfoots weren't hobbits.

386
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,640
Now, that's bullshit according to the lore, but...

387
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,640
I don't know.

388
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
I don't know.

389
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
I don't know.

390
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
I don't know.

391
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
I don't know.

392
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
I don't know.

393
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
I don't know.

394
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,640
I don't know.

395
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,640
Like, Shunkus.

396
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,640
You guys were all thinking it.

397
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Yep.

398
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
A little bit.

399
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:42,000
Look at the way they're shooting this.

400
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,920
They're shooting from down and up all the time.

401
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,140
The hobbits don't look like hobbits, they look like, again, just fucking people.

402
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:55,360
Yeah, so I recall seeing a making of the original Lord of the Rings way back in the day.

403
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,400
showed like all the camera angle tricks to make um to make elijah wood look so much smaller than

404
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,280
everyone else right yeah they built the cart with like the seat in the back and like all that stuff

405
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,160
they really made them look like they were tiny people and this i don't get that feeling from

406
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:18,240
this at all why do you got leaves in your hair because they're quirky their culture it's their

407
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:26,320
culture basically it's a a very lazy way to make them look oh they're like either finicky

408
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:33,040
so i'm guessing they're like tree ground uh hobbits i'm guessing well the thing is

409
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,000
in the show they're described as no uh nomadic people that travel with the growing seasons

410
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,680
for all the sense that makes and they're supposed to be super stealthy so i'm assuming that's why

411
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:53,760
they've got branches in their hair oh that's their camo not wolf ah fuck me

412
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,200
i heard you're just gonna have an aneurysm watching this the thing is i'm not even the

413
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:06,080
biggest like lord of the rings lore fanboy person but it's just basic shit like this pisses me off

414
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:13,280
because they know this isn't a wolf and yet they call it a wolf anyways all wrong quote unquote

415
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:21,520
it doesn't look like l running mr anderson ah they're doing they're already sabotaging

416
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,480
his character how's that nice you know you notice that notice how he's already making errors and

417
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:33,040
scratching out words he's unrefined not thinking clearly his guidance from a strong female

418
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:39,600
character i mean i think aileron is already like a thousand years old but details details

419
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:51,920
the writers don't know that

420
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,160
wait this is the exact same as house of the dragon it's the same story where like the girl

421
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,720
the girl boss flies off in the dragon and gets the job done and comes back and the king is mad

422
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,080
that she did it all on her own but doesn't get recognized for her work yeah it's the same fucking

423
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,520
story it's it's the classic strong female character she's the only one who knows

424
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:20,880
and ever nobody believes her everybody else are morons she's gotta be proven right yeah everybody's

425
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,120
gonna be like oh you're right oh you know that story isn't necessarily bad john snow did that

426
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,480
was pretty well done with him and the white walkers it was well done in mass effect when

427
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,360
no one believed shepherd about the reapers but like yeah there are other stories you can do with

428
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,320
girl characters you know anime is full of stories you can do with girl characters there are but this

429
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:47,120
is the only strong female character hollywood knows like this is is their strong female character

430
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,160
sadly it's sadly true for a lot of mainstream writers and that's why we see it regurgitated

431
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,480
in multiple shows because they they're creatively bankrupt and they don't know how to write female

432
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,800
characters she's adventurous by the way

433
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,320
look she's female frodo oh my jesus she is well isn't this more isn't this more female

434
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,640
bilbo because frodo frodo was kind of reluctant to go on the journey actually yeah that's actually

435
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,200
more apt because bilbo was the one who had that wanderer's lust but was like holding himself back

436
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,400
and then finally gave in yeah frodo i mean i just watched fellowship the ring frodo he was more like

437
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,080
he did it because he was a good person he knew it had to be done but he didn't really want to

438
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,440
he was a reluctant hero but he understood that uh gandalf couldn't take the ring and that he

439
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:48,480
had to take it he was the ring bearer somehow i feel like you know adriel might have an objection

440
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:56,960
soon look at how mad she is yes jesus christ she's just fucking glaring

441
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,800
it's a ceremony for her you can at least be nice for the second right

442
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:10,000
wait i thought the whole point of this story was that everyone was going going to valinor yeah

443
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:16,480
no no the elves pursued across the sea and that's why they founded various elven kingdoms like

444
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,920
linden where they're right now because they were hunting the uh the things that were stolen by

445
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:28,480
oh fuck i can't remember but all elves have a calling to go back to valinor right you know i

446
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:36,240
will say like it it looks good a lot of the scene compositions are are the production i don't know

447
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,320
about the scene composition but like the production value is okay my annoyance is in the the lack of

448
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:49,360
the representation of these are not people i feel a bit too human yeah yep they're a bit stiff

449
00:21:50,880 --> 00:22:00,240
like those wooden carvings oh god damn it but like galadriel is basically just ray

450
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,920
from from the star wars sequels that's fairly accurate i'd say just in different clothing

451
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,800
every female protagonist has to be ray no don't and uh if you have objecthood

452
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:19,840
you're a bigot and you hate strong empowered women obviously it is over the evil is gone

453
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,960
oh my god literally my feelings that's a you problem lady ah yes my lived experiences

454
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:36,960
what she ironically just pulled that well the problem too is galadriel has not

455
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:44,160
seen galadriel was not with the army galadriel has not fought sauron my friend

456
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,760
damn friend zone but the other way around

457
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,560
hahaha

458
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,280
i mean at least the map's done nicely that looks pretty nice but that's about it i want to run my

459
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:14,480
hand through it i'll bet it feels nice get your greasy paws off me map that's so textury it looks

460
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:27,040
very textory that's true i'm sorry kibs you racist you look at a black woman is this the

461
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:33,360
person to laughter i'm sorry but like when it comes to cultural you have this like european town

462
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,320
and then there's just a random black lady and she has like the black head scarf and and like the

463
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,040
like the circles hanging that's like an african thing

464
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,840
we just got random diversity scattered everywhere

465
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,120
and the worst part it feels like a quota doesn't it oh speaking of diversity hires we got a new

466
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:03,600
character it's a black elf so is he supposed to be some kind of dark elf or is it literally just

467
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:15,520
a black elf okay yep they're all fair-skinned also like i think they've made have fucked up

468
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,520
because they mentioned this is the south lands i mean this should be the lands of like

469
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,640
let it go i didn't see where the map was painting

470
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,560
now still honestly because uh this doesn't look like thinking

471
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,280
by the way racism is bad in case you were unaware racism is indeed bad

472
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,840
unless it's against elves thank you amazon prime for showing us i hate his hair most of all like

473
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,120
sure okay so he's black or portrait hold on look at his breastplate though what about it

474
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,680
it's made of wood or something it's made of plastic those are the finest costumes at spirit

475
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:05,280
halloween okay his hair is the thing that annoys me the most because okay he's like it's the

476
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,600
current year they've got to have black elbows because reasons but at least they could have

477
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:17,440
given him long flowing hair instead like he is the most anti-elf you can imagine like in in tone in

478
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,520
demeaner in appearance because elves are supposed to have long beautiful hair give him long dread

479
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:31,280
locks that's not beautiful we got an interracial relationship now yep kib called it kib genius

480
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,640
but another short-haired elf they all seem to be short-haired now pretty much really

481
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:47,200
the elves are talking about their life we gotta have vulgarity you know again they're just

482
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,240
people that's the thing they're just fucking people with people's concerns

483
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,400
they're just humans they're not even elves my point is that's a cool shot only twice

484
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,960
in known he waited till now to speak his point after like three hours of walking

485
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,440
listen you just wait for three hours you know my point is actually

486
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,480
it's like what what the fuck were you talking about maybe they're just elves from a different

487
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:27,120
region idk that region's called amazon land of amazon basil's high king

488
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,680
do you notice also every time they pronounce a name or a place name they change their

489
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:41,600
pronunciation drastically not only they can just talk always talk like that that's the problem

490
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:47,920
most of the time they speak like just regular fucking humans and then when they occasionally

491
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:54,240
inadvertently have to say something that's related to lord of the rings their pronunciation changes

492
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,920
to be fair arch you're barely speaking like a human right now damn he's more elf than these

493
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:07,360
characters she's got the hots for that black elf though look at her he knows

494
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,640
you know why are you at my home or make

495
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,600
oh jesus

496
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,960
that's fucking racist all right time for the the action to brew up fellas here we go

497
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,800
where are you going dramatic music

498
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,360
so obviously the cow's been grazing in corrupted lands

499
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,000
corrupted lands they're unaware of you know do they do any reconnaissance whenever we're

500
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,080
garrisoned here they just sort of chilled in their little fort and that just waited

501
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,400
yeah weren't they there for like 79 years or something they weren't patrolling around

502
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:02,640
attention they're just sitting there twiddling their thumbs it's a lie maybe that's why he's

503
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,960
a half no i'm sorry child then what happened to him his dad is the elf though you think so

504
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,160
this is the real bouncy that's why he's light brown that's racist kibbs race is a social

505
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:22,640
construct oh that's the evil looking sword he's got the sign sorry just stand there at attention

506
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,160
mean to be fair it's the most elven thing they've done so far

507
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,640
we wait in full armor what happens if you fall off the boat

508
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,920
very descriptive thank you strange how

509
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:50,080
on my way is there a tin can look like it like in the background i'm pretty sure that was a tin

510
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,480
can in the background there better than a starbucks cup

511
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,080
you're the only one who let me hit it

512
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,360
listen he's desperate okay well the warden's fucked up a bit

513
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,560
maybe you should have warned the garrison instead of your girlfriend

514
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,760
still standing there they've been standing there for fucking days

515
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:27,920
no one can take the sword from you no one's doing anything on the ship they're just standing see the

516
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:34,880
writers think that overs overly ceremonious will be very elven delicate i mean again to be fair

517
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,360
this is the most elven they've been so far yeah but even when they get on the ships to valinor

518
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:47,200
and the other movies like they don't wear their full battle garb no no but give them a point for

519
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:55,600
trying i don't give them a point for being amazon barge listen i like my knife i want to stab

520
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:02,720
somebody with it now this is actually a pro second amendment message never give up your arms damn

521
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:12,960
oh my god valinor is an arwelian nightmare so how does luminor work like uh like valinor

522
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,560
yeah that's i mean it's our valinor it's like the land of the see i'm not super familiar but

523
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:23,280
i've been starting to read up on the lore a lot more but basically it's like a magical land where

524
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,920
nothing dies and so that's why the immortals like elves that go there you know that's where

525
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,120
they belong they don't belong in middle earth i see it's the land of the valor the valor

526
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,080
so can just anybody sail there or do only elves though how to

527
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:44,480
uh only else mortals can exist in the land works there's sometimes rare exceptions but that's why

528
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,560
there's the van then alcom frodo was able to go there they made an exception for him because he

529
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,120
did and you know that was only because he was going to die anyways like he would die in valinor

530
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,600
it's a mercy because mortals aren't allowed to valinor because they apparently like it's sort

531
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,680
of alluded that they age too quickly but immortals are fine there it's also because it's nice to have

532
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:12,560
the ethnostates i think they brought all the ring bears so they brought frodo sam and bilbo

533
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,160
yep because like you guys are in it you can you can come on

534
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,400
you can join our ethno state you're your exception you guys are honorary ways you can come in

535
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:37,920
nice to follow yeah i reckon i can swim to shore from here i'll just jump out

536
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,400
like she literally did no way she's gonna swim all the way back home

537
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,720
do you understand writers how far she's gonna have to swim now

538
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,920
isn't like a thousand miles like she'll never make it of the atlantic ocean she'll never make

539
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,640
it because the currents would pull her away even if she swam as hard as she could that's fucking

540
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:13,040
horseshit she doesn't even have like a trifle to hold on to yeah she's basically dead so uh gg

541
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:21,360
you're dead dead if you do that the natural reaction to anyone seeing a meteorite crash

542
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,080
nearby wandered towards the burning wreckage especially if you're like a you know primitive

543
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:33,200
civilization you're not terrified or anything also what's in here what well first the meteorite

544
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:41,440
wouldn't look like this but i guess it's a person crying in the show that's how she's crying too

545
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:47,760
everybody's they have water in their eyes wait wait wait that that is sauron that is sauron

546
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,560
oh my episode two is up already what yeah yeah yeah so uh they did like an episode one and an

547
00:32:54,560 --> 00:33:05,760
episode two in one day you gotta keep going kibs let's spend a few minutes talking about what the

548
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:13,600
fuck we just watched oh god because we watch okay here here's what a pilot's supposed to do right

549
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,400
introduce your characters introduce your setting introduce at least get the conflict started this

550
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,680
shouldn't be the first time you're exposed to what lord of the rings is it feels like because

551
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:30,480
this pilot relies on so much past knowledge of everything that's come before the only reason

552
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:37,600
that we care about any of this is because of the previous movies they didn't establish anything

553
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:45,600
that makes us care in this dev you're you're being facetious okay they introduced her brother for at

554
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:55,200
least five seconds and then he died hold on they introduced him he maybe had like two minutes or

555
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,640
five minutes of screen time before he died and they foreshadow his death in the introduction

556
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,000
to his characters like this story is so rushed like we should have gotten a whole like thing

557
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,320
about the the war of wrath rather than just like the war of wrath happened and it was bad

558
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,760
i was like okay but but yes so what what what happened in gladiator story she she went through

559
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,520
the ice she found evidence of sauron nobody believed her she went back she was being sent

560
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,480
away she refused and jumped into the ocean like that that's the tldr of it right but

561
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,480
yeah so sauron's returning and things are getting corrupted and all things are bad

562
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:40,880
yes so so the other stories actually had stuff kind of happening in them but it really seems

563
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:47,200
up something but like it's kind of setting up something but it doesn't make you care about

564
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,760
any of the characters beyond this is these are people that you already know from previous movies

565
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:58,080
because they're doing the same thing because the the completely new characters they're so bland

566
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:04,320
it's it's the same problem with house of dragons like you are expected to know

567
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,840
the reason why you should give a shit like you should care about galadriel because it's

568
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:18,480
galadriel it's given you no other reason to give a shit we also established um oh god elrond but

569
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,440
we also established i can't remember the guy's name let's call him black elf or belle for short

570
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,840
and we also established yeah belle and uh harfoot lady so we have three story arcs that have been

571
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:34,480
prepped so i somehow they're gonna all intermingle i think the harfoot one's gonna have something to

572
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,400
do with the sauron dude yeah i have a sneaking suspicion they're all gonna be kept completely

573
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,640
separate and i have another sneaking suspicion that they might actually be taking place at

574
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,560
vastly different times oh so that would be really weird well they did that with the witcher and it

575
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,240
was fine with the witcher with all the different time periods kind of shifting around fine and

576
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,080
fine it was it was a decent show the witcher i like the witcher come on you guys are being

577
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:05,760
apologetic just because henry kevl was in it that's it i've established it to be fair the

578
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:12,400
arrival of sauron is a pretty big deal and but he's not obvious he's the stranger this is part

579
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,000
of his ploy yep he's pretending he's gonna be he's gonna blend in with the rest of everyone

580
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,840
because he's gonna eventually slip his way to numenor and trick the numenorians into

581
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,720
trying to break the ban because they'll be like the elves are you know they're they're preventing

582
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,720
from going to valor because they're they're holding all their power and immortality and

583
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,880
he's like what really that's they're dicks i want the immortality they're why can't we have it arch

584
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,280
i know you and i disagree on house of the dragon like you think it's bad i think it's like okay

585
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,000
it's not amazing but it's okay i'm gonna beat you we're gonna beat you i feel like house of the

586
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,600
dragon actually set up its principal characters to have personalities way more than this because

587
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:57,920
we know that in that show the king is kind of weak and and he doesn't have a grasp on anything

588
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,640
we know that that the daughter is is is intelligent but overlooked we know that

589
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,760
her uncle he he's the evil uncle who wants the throne like they set up the characters

590
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,640
well enough that we can tell who they are based on personality i don't think this show did that

591
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,640
they all just seem to be the same bland person i feel like this show is kind of the same though

592
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:24,000
because this show is also and then and then and then and the house of dragon is and then and

593
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,120
then and then it tells us rather than really showing us and when it shows us it's overt

594
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,960
it's like look his fingers falling off look he knocked over a statue and broke it

595
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:39,840
seeing his house is coming undone foreshadowing it's a little too on the nose that's the thing

596
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,040
dev is actually correct here in that house of dragons has done more like it's

597
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:51,360
it's basic bitch shit the king is literally rotting to demonstrate that his realm is falling

598
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:56,960
apart the uh the princess is the only capable individual that can get anything done and her

599
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:05,760
uncle is like yes yes yes yes yes but at least those are characters galadriel's only character

600
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,360
here she is it was actually a brilliant uh comparison she is ray she is the cardboard box

601
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:16,640
that speaks she is strong female character and the other characters they they don't even exist

602
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,160
like elrond what we knew about elrond well he writes okay cool uh what about gilgalad well he

603
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:28,240
has like leaves that are made of gold uh he's a king and he's wrong actually that's what we know

604
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,360
the show hasn't even really told us about his position like what is he king of is this an

605
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:39,520
important title like is he respected well we kind of know he's king of linden because he's

606
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,880
in linden that's the thing you know he's king of linden well you'd assume he's king and he's also

607
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,280
in linden ads are but what's linden a normal person what's linden is that the entirety like

608
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,320
is that all of it they show you on the map what linden is it's next to ariador but the thing is

609
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,600
what they don't really show you is like the borders or anything like that yeah exactly and

610
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:05,200
what's ariador yeah it's like i mean the map has only panned past ariador it's never actually done

611
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,640
anything there it's just a thing on the map for the newcomer ariador means nothing and we also

612
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:16,720
introduced them to complete the other else i don't dare like okay who's he why why is he in the

613
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:24,640
southlands the southlands as well that is one hell of a skip and a jump and also they keep present

614
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:30,640
they're presenting the southlands as if they were like major allies to morgoth like they would

615
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:37,280
barely have counted in morgoth scheme like that was not a war of men like that was a war in which

616
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,360
balrogs were generals the if i remember right they were more like a vassal state fighting alongside

617
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:49,600
his forces but that's about it so for the elves to like set up a garrison there to police their

618
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:55,120
conquered subjects i don't really remember that being a thing because i i think like the only

619
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,720
time they're relevant again from what i know is when the numerians start you know setting

620
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,680
colonies and building up stuff over there and they've got a full site the worst part is too

621
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:10,000
i'm actually kind of annoyed they're white they should be brown yeah because we're in the south

622
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,160
lands these are the people of ruin right so it should be kind of like southerly like a little

623
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:23,520
bit arabic kind of yeah a mix of arab and mongol a little bit more instead they're just they come

624
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,920
across as like just european peasants yeah because yeah you're right so like european so i i don't

625
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,840
know the lore the way that that that archon kibbs does but i do know that there are certain places

626
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:42,640
where certain human races come from in lord of the rings and every population shouldn't just be

627
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:48,160
mixed race my impression of like southlands weren't they like the people on the boats that

628
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,600
showed up like uh at the third movie they have returned to the king they have like big elephants

629
00:40:53,600 --> 00:41:04,800
hey yes those guys um actually those are different oh god because those i i know the name but i can't

630
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,600
bring it up because this is from the horadrim right yeah horadrim because this is actually to

631
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:15,920
the east the southlands is past the lands of mordor so this should not look like a european

632
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,280
village which is it's interesting isn't it like they've got a force in a black elf but in a

633
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,920
position where they could actually have a diverse village like now illy law europe the corsairs were

634
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,480
coming up the river or the direction where the river leads to goes to os giliath os giliath is

635
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,520
the former capital of gondor ministeroth is actually a uh like city fortress kind of thing

636
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,600
the that's the thing that the corsairs are actually white because they're full of

637
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:47,360
numerians oh yeah they are i forgot about that they're the black numerians right

638
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,280
yes also the black numerians aren't actually black by the way this is they call them black

639
00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:03,200
because they turned evil that's racist i'm sorry but i'm not i don't dare and bronwyn

640
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,320
like their romance is not explained it's just like they they meet you see them by the well

641
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:13,360
and they're like i'd like to have sex with you i know but i can't see this is just modern writing

642
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,840
because it's the forced interracial relationship that does that comes out of nowhere in left field

643
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:24,560
it's not natural there's no buildup for it i mean galadriel got a prequel okay well introduce the

644
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,040
other characters then at the very least i don't they're like arriving you know looking around

645
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:35,520
uh being called a black person for a while then he goes like i think you're cute even though you're

646
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,040
black something like something to establish a relationship but they're kind of forcing it along

647
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:47,520
the show is rushing he said like you're the only kind touch i felt okay like there's i'm saying

648
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:54,320
i'm sensing that there's like an implied history between them but it's like we're not we're not

649
00:42:54,320 --> 00:43:00,480
shown nor was it told well maybe maybe they'll show it to us that's we want to give him the

650
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,000
benefit of the doubt and maybe they'll get a flashback back yeah but that's gonna flashbacks

651
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,600
work sometimes for twists but this is kind of on the nose because i swear to god that kid that is

652
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:17,360
his kid you think so oh because his ears are being dead left yep his dad also left because of that too

653
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:22,240
remember and and his ears are all hidden by his hair you think it's gonna be i think i think the

654
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,760
elf dude's dad originally is gonna hate him and he's like i don't like you but they'd be like

655
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,960
actually you're my dad and you know what we're pretty cool actually and then they shake hands

656
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:37,280
he's also found the sword of sauron which is god damn it don't worry about it that's just

657
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:45,280
lying under the floor that's true most of sauron's artifacts kind of have a corrupting influence

658
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,720
well i mean it did kind of glow and look at him a bit that's true everybody's gonna turn evil

659
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:59,440
he's still fine this is the thing um well what they established in the uh original movie trilogy

660
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,920
boromir is tempted by the ring by just being near it he's willing to kill his compatriots

661
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,520
to her normal human touching an artifact of sauron should be a pretty fucking big deal

662
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:18,720
yep remember the council when they were in uh oh god uh the thing with the e basically

663
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,680
elrond's uh fortress city place and they were all fighting and bickering because the rings

664
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:32,480
influence is that powerful yeah yes i'm letting like the different magnitude again like the racist

665
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,480
boy look at the stories i was like oh i want it um but it's like the him holding it there's it

666
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,680
doesn't even look like it's having much of an effect on him yeah you think that he'd be like

667
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,120
instantly possessed or something or at least get like mind fucked should we start the second

668
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:58,160

00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,000
at least they're establishing the reason why he's going to be talked into making the rings

704
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,960
hot as a dragon's tongue and as pure as starlight the things we could use it to create could

transform middle earth nothing bad could ever be created from such a thing don't worry about it

706
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:27,360
have you considered seeking partners outside the confines of our own race feel far outside

707
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:35,120
you gotta be a free marketeer man they don't have montages for when they move across man they just

709
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:48,320
running across the plains anymore it's like uh it's like a loading screen it's like a little

710
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:55,200
picture all right yes calin broad one of the richest and most powerful influential individuals

711
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:02,880
in the entirety of elvenham walks to kazakhdum he's a simple man he wouldn't go on a cart with

712
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:09,440
a bunch of soldiers no luxuries no creature comforts it just not even backpacks how the

713
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,400
fuck did they eat wasn't there that special elf bread that keeps you fed yeah but how the fuck

714
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:22,640
much of it will it be carried beyond what you want it is elrond of lindon accompanied by calabrimbor

715
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:32,640
lord of oregano and no one else no all right okay i admit that was kind of funny

716
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:41,360
the dwarves are base now trust me is he gonna walk back again yep a few days all right go ahead and

717
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:48,160
walk back by the way all sorts out by myself i don't know why i brought you motherfucking what

718
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:59,040
so he came all the way out that's actually really like how many weeks must have taken

719
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,160
well he's walking back by himself

720
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,560
being the doors at their height is pretty cool yeah

721
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:17,680
are all the females beardless so what yeah this is a inconsistency like oh my god

722
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:25,440
isn't the tokens female dwarves like they're supposed to have like full beers yeah

723
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,160
they didn't have the stones motherfuck yeah they didn't have the stones to do it like the

724
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,640
witcher did i appreciated that which we saw the bearded dwarves they were female that was cool

725
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,280
problem is you've already established that he's going to get the workforce

726
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,480
yeah that's just the big problem with the prequels you already know what's going to happen right

727
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,200
yep oh black dwarfs good fantastic light

728
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:04,800
well you know what in warcraft they have the dark iron dwarves that are they're dark skinned

729
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:10,800
yeah they're literally evil yes they're actually an evil race like personally i disagree now but

730
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,320
if you want to say that all black people are evil then this is a hill you can die on dev you're

731
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:25,120
welcome to it looks like a comfy spot right here dev uh hello we're back to the fucking hobbits

732
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:31,840
not hobbits you mean the store brand hobbit he's being holy

733
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,600
it turns out this is actually skyrim hold on i know what's gonna happen

734
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:48,880
it's gonna be her credit that the ring didn't affect uh frodo or something oh

735
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:56,880
she's gonna give sauron just enough love that the ring will have some kind of spell on it

736
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:02,080
that doesn't affect hobbits in the same way they're french right eat the snail

737
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:10,960
eat the bugs guys which animal finds the shell is it a snail or is it a crab because a crab

738
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:16,400
that finds the shell right and the snails grow their shells the uh hermit crab finds their

739
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,640
shell um snails they're just like um they grow them

740
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:29,120
he's out of mana guys he can't cast anymore my god i hate the hobbit parts

741
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:38,800
they're pretty bad aren't they i like i like angry hobos are on the can you migrate

742
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:50,720
any migrants they're migrants arch i also want to point out here nomads do not grow crops

743
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:58,560
because to grow crops you need to you know stay yeah yeah oh my gosh she's still swimming

744
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:04,320
holy shit she's just giving her just gonna be her swimming for like 30 minutes

745
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:10,880
oh this is fantastic though and ironically i love the fact that she's just gonna swim home

746
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:18,880
well we were complaining before that the elves just seemed like humans maybe this is maybe

747
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:24,000
this is how they make her seem like an actual elf they let her swim home absolutely i mean

748
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:31,680
no human would do this see beast shark in each year don't forget she's got to be a strong

749
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,160
independent women that's gonna be about

750
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:45,760
the horns or something or a shipwreck out here maybe they're the numerians

751
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,920
sailing west i don't know

752
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,560
that's a very convenient piece of wreckage

753
00:54:54,560 --> 00:55:02,960
only the women's are the good guys only the women let her on jesus man she is flat as a pancake

754
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,920

like you're all gonna die dude come on yeah

757
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:25,040
and this is such a pointless thing like they're worried like yeah we can't bring her aboard

758
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:31,600
you're at the you're floating wreckage in the middle of god knows what wait until we can see

759
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:39,280
the sails corsairs probably these waters do you want to be skinned alive corsairs who's fucking

00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:46,240
corsairs nice come back and pick you up is it gonna be a ghost ship as a hound no it's being

761
00:55:46,240 --> 00:56:00,880
warm yep okay trailer shot yeah okay that would have destroyed this raft that would have no it's

762
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:06,320
it's still sturdy down oh my god can you believe the racism about these humans

763
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:16,320
i don't know what i'll do oh she's gonna kill a thing yep name so they're all fuck because

764
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:22,240
they're it's okay they're racist they deserve it there's another raft because why not

765
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:27,760
now he attached his part he planned all of this beforehand you see

766
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,400
he's like all right i need to get laid come on board

767
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:41,360
um hello there offices mattress i'm the captain i feel like this is some sort of mini game

768
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,440
oh yeah this is when you just tap a a whole bunch to like gain your strength

769
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:54,640
this is the most engaging part of the story so far i think this is the most character moment

770
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:01,040
we've ever had in this show you know i kind of like it though it's something it's something

771
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,560
true he's weak-willed i can see the comedy god help me

772
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,480
what is that abomination

773
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:24,640
where's the beard told you to to stay out of my head the sargon heads it's a bit of a cameo

774
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,080
you know i would have asked sargon to show up but i think it's too late for him might be almost

775
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:32,720
early now well he has to like get up and go to work and he has a wife and kids too so

776
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,480
us neats don't have to worry about that

777
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:48,800
so there are no black doors in the lore are there no no i'll say this so far this is the best part

778
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:56,720
of the show at least they're lively they've got personalities yeah i like doors so far and plus

779
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:03,280
they don't look like people they look like dwarves but if only she had a beard i would

780
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:10,880
actually be happy with this scene yeah reacting skills are actually pretty good i like her as a

781
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:17,040
character yeah you know even though she was the face of so many so many derisions towards the

782
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:22,160
show she's actually a pretty enjoyable character yeah i'm not gonna lie surprised the thing is the

783
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:28,560
problem is she's an enjoyable character but she's still a middle finger to the very idea of tolky

784
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:34,480
all they would have to do is paste a fucking fake beard on her and she'd be a great character like

785
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:40,880
that is insult in and of itself also y'all put her in white face yes are we good too

786
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,600
is

787
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:51,600
wait what is she pulling on here i'm not sure what she's doing

788
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:04,800
the acting director was like look like you're doing semen things so she's like okay i have

789
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:11,840
no idea what i'm doing it's just a stick that's what she's talking on it's just a stick

790
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:16,320
it's just a stick it's just a stick i don't know what she plans to do with it

791
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:25,600
dame better hope that uh it's just a snake like look at that shot she's just talking

792
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:33,200
fucking stick yeah listen what else you're gonna do on that boat a raft she's trying to she looked

793
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:40,160
dizzy in a shot okay so that's what matters we've got a running montage my god oh never mind it's

794
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:47,920
over evil things are happening

795
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:58,240
hey you kind of match the music stone good job thank you hold on you didn't run to the garrison

796
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:04,960
you run to the bar yep all right unarmed peasants it's the only set they have

797
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:13,920
how do you know that we must spread the word no i will not have this gossip runwin i've seen

798
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:20,560
landslides less dangerous than a wayward tongue without proof oh god it's galadriel all over again

799
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:26,320
she knows the truth and the men won't listen we've done this story before show this story

800
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,400
they really like using the same

801
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:49,280
that's a bloody big mice you know when i first saw this tunnel like

802
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:55,040
in the previous scene for some reason i was thinking um fire ants from fallout

803
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:00,000
getting around down there yeah actually i heard a rumor that making a fallout show

804
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,040
yeah that's gonna suck the set leaked oh god and it's set in new jersey at least it's mostly

805
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:12,080
destroyed already i mean it's in a wasteland i'm pretty sure elves are supposed to have

806
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:16,800
pretty good night vision so why is he giving away his position by carrying a fucking lantern

807
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:22,320
in the dark ass tunnel okay

808
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:30,880
yeah just keep swimming my dude i'm i'm sure this uh comes up somewhere yeah swim

809
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:36,240
into an underwater oh jesus christ oh that was lucky ah this is the jump scare scene

810
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:42,960
is there a jump scare scene there's jane behind him

811
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:54,400
oh jesus that was so painfully obvious too now she's running home bitch garrison well to be fair

812
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:01,440
like that is where her son is yeah but but but she didn't go here first though either you go

813
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:08,960
to get your kid or you go to get the soldiers you wouldn't go to the bar first yes yeah she

814
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,400
went into the bars only to be told oh you're a woman you don't know what you're talking about

815
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:22,160
you're wrong she's tried that already she fucked up she went to the wrong group damn

816
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:28,640
he was like oh you're gonna hide in the closet okay but she has no idea what's in the hole

817
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:33,120
like she'd be safer running we need to have a scary scene though where she's scared in the closet

818
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:42,640
do we do we really that sound right now that sound is the creaking of their rubber suits

819
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,960
oh my god lol

820
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:53,120
here it comes yep i think he called it very soon

821
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:01,120
oh it's a soft dress oh no

822
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:13,120
that is a remarkably uh

823
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:20,400
oh jesus okay so this is getting a bit

824
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,000
it's just like they're not

825
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:35,600
it's just that they're not a superhuman uh actually apparently they are according to the amazon

826
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,920
oh excuse me boy i'm entailed by a fucking metal sword so you know

827
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,320
oh strong independent woman

828
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:56,640
why first light i was right there damn strong female wait wait hold on hold on hold on

829
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:02,160
jesus christ this is loud in that scene there was light coming in through the windows in the

830
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:08,640
bar wouldn't you just go now no damn the town's about to go no we gotta wait till the last second

831
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:14,720
we need to get that attention why did they give the goblins a chance to attack them yeah it's not

832
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:19,200
fair dev some of the characters need to die off so they can you know get rid of them gotta make the

833
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:24,960
stakes seem high so it's just very clear why like she went to the bar first it's so she can have

834
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,320
that i told you so a little bit yeah yes that was the only reason

835
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:38,000
oh

836
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:54,400
yeah and she's just gone here she goes she's like sinking like a rock now she's tangled

837
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,160
yeah good job that's a very good idea woman

838
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:06,160
alla branda says like should i shave her i mean she didn't have sex with me so maybe she's not

839
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:11,600
worth it yeah she kind of she was a little bit but she might have a bit of a prude but yeah that's

840
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:17,360
right she's right though she might because she did say bind see he misinterpreted it

841
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:27,920
you could just haul up the rope fucker oh cop in a feel i see you'll have to sleep with me now

842
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:34,640
i'm gonna take her sword yeah just mind you dagger actually listen he's awake again

843
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,240
she passed out a second ago but i guess all about fresh air mister revitalized her

844
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,760
oh yeah yeah the fresh air underwater

845
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,120
find yourself to me this time

846
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:51,120
oh my god so she was like unconscious underwater and he had to be helped in the end

847
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:58,960
they probably rewrote the scene because like oh it's we can't have the men being strong

848
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:06,800
erases it this is just the hippie commune it's a lantern we use fireflies

849
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,000
that's a lot of fireflies in there

850
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:16,000
oh my god he's whispering to like gandalf i clapped when i saw it

851
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:35,840
how did you get to that conclusion the writers needed us to okay damn the bugs died they all

852
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:46,400
just fucking died are dead but the ones inside her lantern are okay yeah yeah magic protected

853
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:52,240
them i guess how many fireflies you got to collect to put in there that's like a several day project

854
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,360
well that sucks for them i guess digging to the bell rock

855
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,340
okay

856
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,880
oh it's the arkenstone

857
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:16,240
are you gonna clap when you see it kibs remember it's dipper dipper not gonna show it though they're

858
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:22,000
too much of a no they didn't show it they didn't have that copyright either they're trying so hard

859
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,800
with the member berries it's not even funny do is behaving remarkably calmly for a person with

860
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:33,840
an orc hole in his house they just moved a table over it it's fun it reacts to his blood interesting

861
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:40,080
also did it draw the rolling back or something oh it is yeah reconstructing itself

862
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,800
yeah there's definitely something wonky going on with this guy

863
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,800
he's a guest mother i will command the old legion soon what

864
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:56,880
i'm calling it numen orient i better be right or barges getting beaten

865
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,000
nah this is the end of the episode that's what this is

866
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:13,760
okay so i'd sum that up as a lot happened and nothing happened kibs stop it

867
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:21,120
i can't i'm too lazy he's like how can you be this crazy do i hear noises

868
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:29,840
no it's your imagination yeah the trailer is playing for some reason why is it playing how

869
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:34,240
is it even whatever if i click this button and then pause it and then it will shut up

870
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:44,320
all right yes so episode two we one and two two punch double feature uh-huh that was two

871
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:52,160
hours of my life and i do not feel particularly enriched yeah i kind of i kind of like i don't

872
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:59,920
feel anything really i feel apathy actually about the whole show honestly see like it wasn't

873
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:06,080
a so bad it's good kind of thing you know it was just kind of you know i don't want to be

874
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:15,040
too mean to it i i'm i there was parts of it i liked i'm mildly entertained but yeah like

875
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:20,480
the village setting was so boring yeah like when the galadriel was like nah i'm a swim home

876
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:29,280
yeah that was like that was pretty good hey at least it went as horribly as you'd expect except

877
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:34,080
for you know randomly stumbling brilliant ideas after brilliant ideas this episode like tying

878
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:41,200
herself oh fuck she's like she's been a fuck up this whole time even as the show is trying to

879
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:46,240
tell us that she's implacable and infallible yeah i tried to make her feel like oh she's so smart

880
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:51,520
she knows she's she's right all along is this like and she just it feels like she's just been

881
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:59,040
handed the idiot ball tie yourself to the sinking rack jump into the unending ocean

882
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:07,920
bind yourself to me strong women sinks the symbolism there pull on the stick on on your raft

883
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:16,080
thing the only thing i've enjoyed so far are the dwarves like everything else interesting

884
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:22,080
i like the dwarven city that was like underground and stuff i thought i thought that was cool

885
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,480
a little bit of effort actually went into it as well like the images there

886
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:35,360
they had the adorvan like like uh agriculture and like the waterfalls is showing them how how

887
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:40,720
they get food down there it's just like how they live they're showing how they bring light down

888
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:46,960
yeah that's interesting but what is this like just wish we'd seen more of that and we've seen

889
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:53,600
more of that everywhere with like the elven setting and like the human setting even like

890
01:10:53,600 --> 01:11:02,480
the human setting doesn't have to be just boring european-esque village it's just but it is but it

891
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:08,480
is yep yeah everyone's choreography is probably the strongest in this entire show and the rest

892
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:15,440
are just kind of wet farts okay that's the problem with the timing here so this is very

893
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:21,280
early for the humans and you see those original hunters and they look very savage like wearing

894
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:26,960
retarded hordes for some reason and yet their civilization is actually pretty fucking advanced

895
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:31,840
like they've got tons of stone structures they're living in settled villages they've got livestock

896
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,600
like it's not terribly far off because remember the the humans that helped the elves were gifted

897
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:40,960
that thing barch numenor and so they're on their little island of numenor and this is like their

898
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:46,560
golden age but it's also coming to an end because everything's about to go south well that's another

899
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:51,440
thing too humans and numenoreans are not the same thing either like the numenoreans are superior

900
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:58,640
species wow do you hear this oh my god i mean they lived for 200 years i think that qualifies

901
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:08,720
well hold on arch are they white yes but yes but by now their their lifespans are beginning

902
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:12,960
to shrink and that's where the jealousy is going to kick in they're starting to forget about the

903
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:18,480
whole everything about the ban on balanor and everything else they become arrogant and decadent

904
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:22,160
and i think that's what the show is going to probably show what do you what do you all think

905
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:30,560
of hobo sauron he feels like he he isn't there for any reason other than they were like where we

906
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:38,240
can't have hobbits somehow but how do we make them relevant i know sauron so the hobbits help sauron

907
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:46,480
so you're sorry the harfoot i did the harp like i called it like i am i am seriously calling it

908
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:51,760
like they're gonna do something and they're gonna like help in some way sauron to life

909
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:56,400
it's gonna all be thanks to nori that frody was able to frodo was able to carry the ring

910
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:01,680
it was actually nori the real hero that's what's gonna be sauron's master plan for rebuilding the

911
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:06,240
world was actually like yes i'll help the hobbits because they were my loyal allies and then frodo

912
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:14,160
fucking throws the ring and there's like god why i trusted you oh god what if it turns out

913
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:19,760
yeah let's put the most retarded possible theories okay it's gonna turn out that she

914
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:26,880
that she dies and then reincarnates as frodo he kind of looks a little bit like

915
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:33,440
so actually frodo was had the spirit of a girl the whole time

916
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,560
all right just gonna continue doing this as more episodes come out

917
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:42,640
if you want to we can keep doing it every week but jesus this is painful to watch

918
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:48,480
well at least next week it'll be uh only an hour only an hour instead of because there'll be one

919
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:55,200
episode right yeah about an hour long uh this was quite a time dedication but i don't mind

920
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:01,680
like watching anything is like no matter how bad as long as we're watching with like people it can

921
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:08,160
be fun yeah how long is this season because we we haven't even seen isoldo or elendil or

922
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:14,480
eight episodes it's eight episodes in i believe it's eight episodes so six left okay so we're

923
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:20,480
we're a fourth in we haven't even met half of the main characters listen arch they're gonna milk

924
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:29,360
this for five god damn seasons five seasons they're gonna try to drag their heels oh my god

925
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:36,480
amazon lord of the rings a hundred years amazon is warty lord of the rings amazon bought the

926
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:42,880
television rights for lord of the rings for 250 million dollars in 2017 and then set up a five

927
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:49,360
season production worth at least one billion dollars this is the most expensive tv series

928
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:54,800
ever made jesus christ you know what it feels like it feels like a big web meh like there's

929
01:14:54,800 --> 01:15:01,040
a lot of production budget stuff in here but by and large my my overall feeling is like like

930
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:08,320
it fine again it's it's the lack of soul like what they're making here is it's it's a lot of

931
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:14,160
the rings we're told but what except actually the dwarves the dwarves are the only thing that

932
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:19,680
i've looked at so far and gone yeah lord of the rings everything else is just people in costumes

933
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:29,920
pretending yeah the elves are just like slightly arrogant like people with pointy ears yeah and

934
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:35,600
their original ears are even all that pointy there there's no magic here like there's no

935
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:44,240
lord of the rings there's no wonder there's no creativity and i die the elves again gill

936
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:49,760
fucking galad is supposed to be one of the mightiest individuals on the side of good like

937
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:56,080
he's a fucking warrior king and he's just some fucking dude like only noticeable because he's

938
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:04,160
probably the only elf with semi-long hair yeah he's just he's just like important elf guy and

939
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:09,200
that's about it wait what what if it what if it what if you know how the elves live for thousands

940
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:16,560
of years right what if it just turns out that elven hair grows so slowly that they just can't

941
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:22,000
grow long hair yet a lot of the younger ones yep it's gonna take him another 100 years another

942
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:28,000
thousand years ago gladriel have long hair like galadriel has long hair as a child that's true

943
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,040
oh dev you've been defeated oh yes well hold on hold on as a child though she's an elf she could

944
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:39,680
have been like 60 in that who knows i've been wrecked never hold on hold on hold on does that

945
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:46,560
mean that the loli the loli at the start of the show is legal no dev no that's not

946
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:56,960
oh and thus the end of the series began yeah it it feels like we're just kind of spinning our

947
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:02,880
wheels here you know like two two hours into a show you should you should have more stuff going

948
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:08,160
on than this in my opinion something should be happening so far the most dramatic thing that's

949
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:13,920
happening is that there are probably goblins and they're probably gonna attack some village of

950
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:19,920
humans in the middle of fucking nowhere of no relevance to anyone yeah why are we supposed

951
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:28,080
to care about this village uh because uh dude with the sauron sword there you go yeah i guess

952
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:34,000
it's the only thing i can think of of you three which of you actually watched the kenobi show

953
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:39,600
we all did i have you all did okay yeah and and you know that i made my big

954
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:46,080
giant essay my two and a half hour long video on kenobi okay um i hope you watched it it took me

955
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:51,280
like three weeks to make it but and all all you listening out there too you better watch it too

956
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:59,200
but i do want to point out um one thing i noticed with kenobi is that if you cut all the fat out of

957
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:05,600
it it's like an okay story it's not great because and that's why i mentioned in that video that

958
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:10,400
there's a guy who took all the all the footage cut it into a two and a half hour movie and it

959
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:18,640
was fine and the more that i watch new tv i'm realizing like for some reason all these new

960
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:25,120
shows they just move so slowly and i think they're trying to mistake moving slow for being epic or

961
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:30,400
they're making that mistake rather and it's like you know sometimes like i i get it like you have

962
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:35,440
a huge story in a massive world and you want to really take it in but you can't just do nothing

963
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:41,200
you know you you the problem is too there is superfluous characters like out on there and

964
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:49,680
bronwyn i don't fucking care halbrand who the fuck is that halford's what it's like we can cut

965
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:57,040
a lot of these characters just right out i have a feeling that after this season is over someone's

966
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:02,160
gonna cut this into a movie like kenobi and it'll probably be like an okay lord of the rings film

967
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:07,680
not gonna be great but it'll be okay if they were just focusing on elrond so far i would have been

968
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:13,040
like okay that was all right like elrond's character he uh he is not elrond like he he

969
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:20,560
cannot follow up agent smith he just kind of brim bore too is just again all of these characters

970
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:26,320
are deeply flawed because they're just fucking people like there's nothing elven about them

971
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:33,280
i don't really never feel feel the majesty as much as when when like um witnessing the elves

972
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:38,800
as they were portrayed in the movies this has none of the mad juice there's there's no like

973
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:45,520
yeah there's no like glow or like ethereal aspect about them they're just like well also

974
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:52,240
what helped is that aside from legolas you didn't see much of them they were there for a few scenes

975
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:56,320
and they would like flow around they would like kind of glide around the place and that would

976
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:00,080
be about it because if you see too much of them you realize that they are just people

977
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:04,640
there's also the style in which it is shot like the lord of the rings movies are very

978
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:13,600
warm kind of a little bright almost they're very magical and inviting they're in color whereas

979
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:18,480
here you've got the classical fucking tv show where everything looks fucking cold and dark

980
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:26,320
and grim and realistic and yeah i guess that's just like the 2020 look yeah well it the 2020

981
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:33,680
look is like the inheritor of the 2008 fallout 3 brown and bloom look you know we're to make it

982
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:37,440
look more realistic they just make it look darker and it's like well sometimes you can make things

983
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:41,920
pretty bright and it looks pretty good sometimes you have to have the you know that spark of hope

984
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:51,120
looks cold and boring and sickly like this is the least majestic person imaginable just a

985
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:56,000
drenched house cat well to be fair she is swimming back home that's true

986
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:04,240
yes the entire length of the island i want to point out that none of that happened in

987
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:10,880
the original lore though like this is all well because that's stupid this is all a ridiculous

988
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:16,800
contrivance to have her in the middle of the ocean to meet halibran who's drifting

989
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:25,200
don't worry about it don't think about it as for what i think is good you know i i i'm also

990
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:30,240
enjoying the dwarf storyline they have character i like i like them uh them getting along with

991
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:36,640
alrond um i don't mind the hobo sauron stuff i can see what they're going for and what they're

992
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:42,160
going for could actually be quite quite good they're just not doing it that well but like the

993
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:48,160
the the the the bone of the story is is actually decent it's it's the galadriel stuff that just

994
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:54,880
seems to be a complete fucking train wreck the galadriel thing is a train wreck and black elf i

995
01:21:54,880 --> 01:22:02,720
just don't care about that's right i forgot about him i didn't even mention him the worst part is

996
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:10,560
right now he was in a hole he was in a hole yeah he's just he just fucked up yeah he's just gone

997
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,800
because the problem is this is actually only going to get worse because right now we have village in

998
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:20,960
the middle of bumfuck nowhere story arc we have elrond story arc we have galadriel story arc and

999
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:26,800
we're gonna get elendil story arc and isildur story arc and the queen lady as well like we're

1000
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:35,520
only going to get more characters disparate spread across this huge universe i can only

1001
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:42,880
hope that the converge at some point but like well it is a lot to keep track of all at once

1002
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:47,280
i think everyone just wants to do game of thrones now you know yeah that was a big thing with a

1003
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:51,040
billion characters like we can just do that just introduce a shit ton of people it's like well

1004
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,480
game of thrones worked for a specific reason and it only kind of worked at the end

1005
01:22:55,280 --> 01:23:00,800
yeah and it fails too i remember very vividly reading through the last like couple of game

1006
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:05,200
of thrones books and thinking to myself god could you fuck off i want to get back to the characters

1007
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:10,640
i care about yep oh bloat of characters just because you have lots of characters your story

1008
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:17,440
doesn't inherently mean good care a good story or an epic for that matter well is that all we

1009
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:25,360
have to say about this is this is this the end my final verdict is meh not worth a billion dollars

1010
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:30,160
no not worth about jesus christ not worth a billion dollars um how about this considering

1011
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:37,280
that uh you know august and early september seems to be just a torrent of shit is this as bad as

1012
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:41,360
the other shows that have recently come out that are everyone's talking about right now oh god this

1013
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:47,920
is nowhere near as bad as halo or as fucking kenobi like this is just mediocre or or is she

1014
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:54,880
hulk she hulks a fucking nightmare jesus i dare not watch that oh no i i watched the first episode

1015
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:58,560
and i was like i can't i can't i can't fucking like naomi refused to watch it with me she was

1016
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:03,520
like nope not the same well because her and i we sat down to watch the halo show because she was

1017
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:08,320
like an xbox kid growing up so she said i want to watch halo so we watch it and it was like a fucking

1018
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:14,720
there's a fucking holocaust watching that thing the i think it depends on the scale you're judging

1019
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:21,680
it by because pablo schreiber the tv show was bad in that it wasn't about halo in the slightest it

1020
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:28,960
was a story about pablo traveling the galaxy it was it was just a and kenobi was the same kenobi

1021
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:34,240
has nothing to do with selves it is a just a big fat middle finger to the star wars universe where

1022
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:40,960
every character acts like a complete fucking retard like the organa's calling kenobi on his

1023
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:47,280
phone like again and again i know you're in hiding and shit but he is in danger what is this thing

1024
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:53,440
this thing is just bloat it is mud like i can't even judge it because i don't even know what's

1025
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:58,880
fucking happening the character's stories have progressed not at all like galadriel's story is

1026
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:03,600
the one that's progressed the most and the only thing that's happened there is she knows silence

1027
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:08,400
alive nobody believes her and she jumped in the ocean like two hours later she's finally

1028
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:14,560
being recovered from the ocean this whole show just feels like just sort of forgettable and i

1029
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,160
think that's probably i think that makes it arguably worse than the other ones because

1030
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:23,920
they're memorable because they're about there this show there's nothing really to talk about

1031
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:29,840
like it's just kind of it's there it's it goes at the pace of a snail and it's not very good

1032
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:33,040
do you know what it reminds me of you know what reminds me of it reminds me of the um the new

1033
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:38,800
harry potter movies the wizarding world movies right um the um the fantastic beast they're

1034
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:42,640
trying to make that into a series and no one really cares and i've seen a couple of them

1035
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:46,720
and they're not bad movies they're just very forgettable movies no one's gonna no one's gonna

1036
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:50,320
remember those in 20 years the way they'll remember harry potter like the originals and

1037
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:55,040
that'll probably be the same with this in 20 years time no one will be right we'll be re-watching

1038
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:59,600
this shit but they'll re-watch the original movies yeah people will remember the good stories

1039
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:06,080
no one will remember these things like kenobi even halo they'll be forgotten yep and it has to

1040
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:12,000
do with the lack of soul because you look at this and it tells you it's lord of the rings like the

1041
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,080
characters have the names of the lord of the rings they even have the little stairs and shit but

1042
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:22,480
there is nothing lord of the rings here like there is no magic majesty there's no mystery there's

1043
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:28,800
nothing that makes you feel like this is a lord of the rings property beyond names and set pieces

1044
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,440
i mean i i would i wouldn't i wouldn't use sargon's term the progressive skin suit for

1045
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:37,520
this one i don't really see it fully but it's a skin suit of some type that's for sure i'll

1046
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:44,160
give it this much like as in terms of actual story there hasn't been any obvious progressivism

1047
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:51,120
beyond every female character being the only competent people in the room but yeah so that's

1048
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:57,760
the current year and the diversity hires but again that's behind the scenes politics the show itself

1049
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:05,600
hasn't got any like political views so far it doesn't i guess i noticed i didn't bring it up

1050
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:11,680
but i noticed one but i it's only like half a political view you'll notice that like all of the

1051
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:16,480
all the not hobbits they're all very isolationist and i was like are they are they are they going

1052
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:22,320
to do that do a trump thing later about about yeah but the hobbits are the isolationists yeah

1053
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:25,760
yeah but that's why i didn't bring it up because i was like maybe maybe not but there are hobbits

1054
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,760
they're hobbits tm there's not hobbits

1055
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:40,240
