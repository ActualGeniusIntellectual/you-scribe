0	8080	As you can see by that timer on the screen, the Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power
8080	9680	comes out in 45 seconds.
9680	10680	Are you guys ready?
10680	11680	No.
11680	12680	We can't wait.
12680	13680	This is good.
13680	18120	And I say that with a full sarcasm.
18120	20200	I'm here with Lilith and Arch and Kibs.
20200	21200	Hello everyone.
21200	22200	How's it going?
22200	23200	Hello everyone.
23200	24480	Arch and Kibs.
24480	29280	So last night I watched the Fellowship of the Ring extended edition with Naomi just
29280	33160	to have like a taste of something good before I knew this was going to come out.
33160	34320	And you know what?
34320	35320	It still holds up.
35320	39580	It's a bit goofy in that 1999 way, but it still holds up generally.
39580	40580	You know what I mean?
40580	43880	It's going to be a classic probably for all time, honestly.
43880	45920	Peter Jackson did a good job with those movies.
45920	50880	The first three are just always going to be like the Lord of the Rings movies.
50880	51880	Yeah.
51880	54120	Before the movies, I actually really wasn't that interested in Lord of the Rings.
54120	55680	I became interested in it after.
55680	67480	In fact, my first Lord of the Rings experience was that god-awful Super Nintendo game, which
67480	70680	turned me off of the entire franchise for like a decade.
70680	71680	Damn.
71680	72680	I don't even know what game you're talking about.
72680	74500	Why is there an animated series?
74500	77880	The fucking animated movies.
77880	83800	Oh yeah.
83800	87600	They're definitely products of their time because the style is ancient, but they are
87600	88600	one-of-a-kind movies.
88600	90520	I forget the name of the animator who did that.
90520	96120	I remember being super scared of Sauron as a kid.
96120	103960	Like when Sauron came on, my eyes would just be fixed like, oh, he's looking at me.
103960	104960	Well now he's M&M.
104960	107600	That might be a priest of Melkor.
107600	108600	Maybe.
108600	109600	We'll see.
109600	112840	There's conflicting stuff about it, but if that's what Sauron looks like, I'm going to
112840	113840	lose my shit.
113840	118920	At some point, I'll have to do like an actual proper video about this show.
118920	123600	This is just going to be like our series debut watch party since we're all hanging out tonight
123600	124900	and watching it.
124900	129760	But I mean, there's been so much stuff coming out about just how bad the show looks, how
129760	131680	the costumes are shit.
131680	136560	Apparently the intro looks like it's something out of a daytime soap opera.
136560	139480	It's a drastic variation in color.
139480	140480	Right.
140480	141560	I've seen the intro.
141560	143040	It looks like a complete joke.
143040	146800	Are we going to watch like some step wives slapping each other?
146800	147800	Nice.
147800	148800	What's going on here?
148800	151960	Dude, if you could have two elven wives, wouldn't you?
151960	153960	Elves are for enslaving.
153960	157900	They're going to get canceled.
157900	162760	It's the variation in the quality that I think has stood out the most to a lot of people
162760	165480	because some of the gear does not look bad.
165480	168280	Like Galadriel's plate armor looks like plate armor.
168280	170800	She shouldn't be wearing it, but beyond that.
170920	176180	And then you've got that lamellar style armor that the Numenoreans wear, which looks like
176180	181480	some kind of a t-shirt with a scale male pattern painted onto it.
181480	182480	Oh, I saw that.
182480	183480	Yeah.
183480	184480	I don't get it.
184480	185480	Why does it look like cheap?
185480	191360	This is like an Amazon Prime show, isn't it right?
191360	194720	Like you would imagine they have lots of lots of money.
194720	200760	You would think they'd be able to afford to pay the say custom designers a little more.
200760	202160	You definitely think, yeah.
202160	206640	But the one thing I will say, you could definitely tell, at least from the trailer, the hand-picked
206640	211520	CGI scenes, like there was a serious amount of effort and money put into those.
211520	215760	When they're like, here's the trailer shots that will make everyone want to watch this.
215760	220680	There's a bunch of CG and then a bunch of characters that just look really cringy.
220680	222840	Yeah, the character designs are bad.
222840	225360	The CGI scene shots don't look half bad.
225360	229320	Yeah, we're going to have to see how this all comes together, and I'm a little bit skeptical
229320	230640	about this whole show.
230640	232440	I think it's just going to be a train wreck, honestly.
232440	234040	Hopefully it'll be a fun train wreck.
234040	236040	I'm hoping in mind, maybe.
236040	245160	I'm hoping it won't be as bad as everybody's is, but it probably will be in all that likelihood.
245160	249000	If it is, okay, if this is a train wreck, it's going to be a train wreck that we're
249000	252320	going to have to live with for five seasons because they've already ordered five seasons
252320	253320	of it.
253320	256080	I can't, like if it's bombs, they're going to cancel it.
256080	258080	I hope to God.
258080	263440	This is the survival of Amazon Studios on the line.
263440	265800	This will not be canceled.
265800	269320	They will push this turd almost no matter what.
269320	276680	Well, there was one that basically said that this will determine prime video going forward.
276680	279560	There's the meme of everyone saying, no fucking hate watching.
279560	280560	Sorry, guys.
280560	282240	We're doing it so that you don't have to, okay?
282240	285280	We'll do it because we're the YouTubers, okay?
285280	287960	You guys, no fucking hate watching out there, all right?
287960	288840	Yeah.
288840	291840	Special exception for us because we're part of the elite now.
291840	295680	Dev laughs, but he's like, yeah, that's true.
295680	296680	We are the new bourgeois.
296680	299040	It doesn't work.
299040	307400	Not like refusing to watch it isn't going to work because we make up 0.0000% of Amazon's
307400	309080	market cap here.
309080	310480	That's not going to make a difference.
310480	313680	Us watching it and honestly reviewing it will.
313680	317400	Yeah, it's true because people will see the review and then be like, oh, well, this sucks.
317400	321320	And then if you have 10,000 of those or 100,000 bad reviews, that does add up.
321320	322840	You have the Gronton Tomato scores and stuff.
322840	328880	Those 100,000 bad reviews is far more powerful than 100,000 people who didn't watch it.
328880	332840	That's one of the reasons why I felt compelled to do the Kenobi video, even though it was
332840	335880	kind of a little bit old by the time I did it, I was like, you know what?
335880	338560	I should try my hand at doing this sort of thing.
338560	342120	So Kibs, Kibs is the one controlling the video feed.
342120	343440	We're already 10 minutes behind.
343440	344440	You're ready?
344440	346440	Kibs, Twitter already knows about this.
346480	350960	Kibs, I'm letting you Twitter already knows we have to catch up if you have to be involved
350960	351960	in the newest thing.
351960	357160	I have to get I have to figure out how this works even because it's like the episodes
357160	358160	are out.
358160	359280	There it is.
359280	360280	They just came out.
360280	362040	Let's watch this shit.
362040	363040	Here we go.
363040	364040	It's starting.
364040	369020	I also have the pleasure to announce that the episodes are already up on the torrent
369020	370520	sites as well.
370520	376080	So if you don't want to support Prime, I'm not suggesting alternatives.
376080	380480	You can hate watch on the seven seas, so to speak.
380480	383280	You're her fidgety.
383280	385560	Nothing is evil in the beginning.
385560	387160	This is how Google began.
387160	389160	Nothing's evil in the beginning.
389160	393160	But even then, there was light.
393160	396160	You mean our Mary Sue?
396160	401160	Even you could have possibly believed there was a scrapbook float.
401160	403040	It's not going to float.
403040	406760	I hate how the elves are just people.
406760	407760	Are these elves?
407760	408760	Wait, I can't even tell.
408760	411020	They've got like regular ears.
411020	412020	You show them.
412020	413020	They're slightly pointy.
413020	415020	Like, look, they're slightly pointy.
415020	416020	Yeah, she's an elf.
416020	417020	Yeah, I guess.
417020	418020	Oh, my God.
418020	419020	It's a little fucking spawn.
419020	420020	Whee!
420020	422240	Oh, it's a magic origami.
422240	425080	Galadriel made a magic spawn.
425080	429520	Oh, evil toxic masculinity.
429520	432800	Toxic fucking white boy males at it again.
432800	437400	Wow, this story is already really bad.
437400	439080	These are elves.
439080	440160	They look like people.
440160	442400	They speak like people.
442400	443400	Like humans.
443400	444400	What the fuck?
444400	448100	Yeah, the ears aren't pointed enough, you know?
448100	450480	It's the way they shoot it, too.
450480	452800	The way they did it in the movies was actually brilliant.
452800	454320	It gave them an in the luminescence.
454320	456600	Yeah, they kind of glowed.
456600	462320	You know, at this point, I think I preferred the three long pointed ears, like a foot long.
462320	464520	You see those in Warcraft's highlighters?
464520	466840	This guy's barely got pointed ears at all.
466840	469100	Also, they should not be talking about darkness.
469100	470360	This is the first age.
470360	473280	They don't even know darkness exists yet.
473280	478560	Ah, that's that's her brother, isn't it, Finrod?
478560	479560	If I had to guess, yes.
479560	481880	But you must learn to discern them for yourself.
481880	484560	I won't always be here to speak them to you.
484560	486360	Oh, no.
486360	489080	Come along.
489080	490080	Foreshadowing much?
491080	493280	God, this is really bad.
493280	496000	Death flags abound.
496000	500080	We have two death flags on them already.
500080	502920	Nice and subtle.
502920	508500	The symbolism of him walking away over the horizon and she not following and her crying.
508500	511280	And she's talking about death.
511280	516880	Oh my God, Story, can you stop?
516880	520440	The two whatchama doozies, I forget their names.
520440	521440	The Elden Ringtrees.
521440	524880	Oh, doing a bit of a time skip, I see.
524880	525880	Just a bit.
525880	526880	Oh, my Jesus.
526880	527880	OK.
527880	528880	Yeah, we.
528880	529880	All right.
529880	532960	We're skipping to this part, fair enough.
532960	536280	How many how many years have we skipped now?
536280	537280	Quite.
537280	539400	I think a thousand, maybe over now.
539920	547920	They're now basically pursuing Morgoth to recover the light of Valinor, a place known
547920	550080	as Middle Earth.
550080	551080	Oh, my God.
551080	552080	I clapped.
552080	554080	I clapped when I saw it.
554080	557040	Oh, God, I hate this shot.
557040	560000	You see, this helmet symbolizes dead soldiers.
560000	563720	Don't worry, it's not just that helmet.
563720	568000	Yeah, here we go.
568000	569720	That's good stuff right there.
569720	576720	So what I shot, we did is collect all the helmets of the elves died.
576720	582920	It is the most unelven thing ever to just pile up those helmets of dead elven soldiers.
582920	585440	Hey, have you guys heard that orcs are black coated?
585440	587440	I don't know what you're talking about, Dev.
587440	589040	I don't want to get cancelled.
589040	595200	Oh, my God, we time skipped to his death even.
595200	597080	So how many years now?
597080	598080	How many years?
598080	602800	Honestly, we're in the thousands, and that's kind of all I know.
602800	605680	I think we're out of the first agent of the second now, aren't we?
605680	607360	Yeah, we're in the second age now.
607360	610600	So we skipped over the entire first stage.
610600	611600	That's good.
611600	616920	Because remember, Lord of the Rings takes place during the third age.
616920	620880	He became a girlboss.
620880	623040	Gaslight Gatekeep Girlboss.
623040	624040	Yes.
624040	628480	Galadriel is personally chasing us.
628480	631960	I assume she didn't originally do this, did she?
631960	633100	No.
633100	638800	Is it just me or is their voices really soft with the music overpowering?
638800	640520	That's been TV and movies for the past decade.
640520	642400	Look at how strong she is.
642400	645160	She's way ahead of everybody.
645160	647560	Of course, they're holding her back.
647560	655960	This was the show I was demonstrating.
655960	661400	Oh, the fuck boy is keeping the girlboss down?
661400	663600	He'll be wrong enough to apologize.
663600	664600	Or die.
664600	666200	She doesn't care about her men, though.
666200	667200	Jesus Christ.
667200	670440	Considering that I did just watch Fellowship, there was that scene where they were on the
670440	673200	mountain, and they were like, we have to turn back.
673200	675200	And then they did.
676200	678200	Galadriel is far stronger than I.
678200	679200	That's abandoned.
679200	681200	She's gonna abandon her own men.
681200	683200	Feels like how empowered she is.
683200	684200	She's like, no, we keep moving.
684200	685200	Oh, no.
685200	696680	My fucking bad command has gotten one of these elves, like, fucking badly injured.
696680	697680	But there it is.
697680	701400	She was right all along.
701400	703240	It's just Elsa's palace.
703280	705280	I hate these elves.
705280	707280	They're not elves.
709280	712280	They're not token elves, at least.
712280	716280	Galadriel just punched through an ice wolf the best.
716280	717280	Well, hold on.
717280	719080	I don't fully know this lore.
719080	722280	Do the elves have super strength like some elves do in this?
722280	726280	They are stronger than mortal men, if I remember right.
726280	727280	Faster.
727280	732680	But not, not punching through a solid wall of ice with their fucking hands in two blows
733120	735120	Probably not that.
735120	737120	Her girl energy makes that possible.
737120	739120	Girl energy?
739120	741120	See, we're in the second age now.
741120	743120	It's second wave elven feminism.
745120	748120	Don't worry, she's super smart and knows everything.
748120	751120	She's a special snowflake, in fact.
753120	757120	That's not how he works, but details.
757120	761120	According to Amazon, actually, it is.
761560	763560	According to Jeff Bezos.
763560	769560	Actually, Jeff Bezos said this isn't his fault.
769560	770560	The show.
770560	771560	Wait, what?
771560	772560	Yeah.
772560	773560	Apologize.
773560	775560	He apologized before the show started.
775560	776560	No way.
776560	777560	Yeah.
777560	779560	I'm sorry, guys.
779560	781560	That's hilarious of Joe.
781560	782560	Jeez.
782560	788560	Literally, what Lou had pointed out, the men are only holding her back.
788560	790560	They're constantly questioning.
791000	792000	There's something here.
792000	793000	He wasn't here.
793000	795000	Can we go home and he's a bitch?
795000	797000	I'm right.
797000	799000	He's always gotta be right.
799000	802000	As we'll probably see throughout the entire thing.
802000	803000	She's always right.
803000	804000	I mean, she's already flawless.
804000	805000	What has she done wrong?
805000	808000	Even when she was a kid, she was perfect, but the children were holding her back.
808000	811000	The white males were holding her back, really.
811000	812000	She...
812000	813000	Oh, shit.
813000	816000	You know, these guys aren't acting like elves, by the way.
816000	820000	Bumbling around an ancient ruin like a bunch of muppets.
820440	822440	That's because she has to save them.
822440	825440	In a lot of stories, elves are just like humans with pointed ears.
825440	827440	Maybe they have more magic, maybe they're stronger.
827440	829440	Like Vulcans, basically, sometimes.
829440	831440	Or like in Warcraft, they're just like other people.
831440	836440	But in Lord of the Rings, aren't they supposed to be like almost godlike?
836440	837440	Fine.
837440	840440	Now, fastly superior to humans.
840440	841440	Yeah.
841440	847440	And the easy thing about you is an actual scene of a fucking human.
847440	849440	I love how right I was.
849880	850880	Christ.
850880	851880	She...
851880	855880	They couldn't do anything to it, but only she could.
855880	856880	Yep.
856880	858880	She's the only confident one of the bunch.
858880	859880	Also, I thought...
859880	861880	I think she's such a bitch.
861880	862880	Uh-oh.
862880	864880	The fuckboy's gonna say something.
864880	866880	Gotta hold the girlboss down.
866880	868880	All these white men holding her back.
868880	870880	Fucking white people, am I right?
870880	872880	Are you...
872880	876880	Are you literally, like, laying down your arms?
877320	879320	No, serious...
879320	880320	Oh, that's...
880320	881320	Ah, fuck me.
881320	886320	They laid down their arms before her feet like a bunch of fucking retard.
886320	889320	Right, so we're off to a horrific start.
891320	893320	Oh, god, is it the retarded people?
893320	894320	Yes, it is.
894320	895320	Yes, it is.
895320	896320	Why do they have those?
896320	898320	Like the wind would blow them over.
898320	899320	Yes, it would.
899320	901320	I love the antler people.
901320	902320	Look at that.
902320	903320	What is that?
903320	905320	They just have giant antlers on their back.
905760	907760	Okay, so this was shown off early on.
907760	910760	Yeah, so these are like hunters, but they wear giant antlers for some reason.
910760	911760	And they just look retarded.
911760	913760	And they were like, look at the new Lord of the Rings.
913760	915760	And this is like the first picture they showed.
915760	918760	And these people, they just look so fucking stupid.
918760	921760	This is the early second age, they're talking about barstools?
921760	923760	These should be fucking neolithic savages.
923760	925760	I have to guess.
925760	929760	I would say they're like wearing the antlers to appear bigger to animals.
929760	931760	See, that's not wrong.
931760	933760	But like, that would scare away predators.
934200	936200	But you'd have a hard time hunting like that.
936200	938200	Oh god, we have the harfoots.
938200	940200	Oh no.
940200	942200	Don't worry, we have a black one too.
942200	943200	Don't ask me how.
943200	944200	So what are these guys?
944200	946200	Are these guys just like Kokiri or something?
946200	947200	Like primitive poppets.
947200	952200	Yes, but Amazon can't call them hobbits because they don't have the rights to the hobbits.
952200	953200	Wait, they actually don't?
953200	954200	Really?
954200	955200	Nope.
955200	956200	They don't.
956200	957200	That's why these are harfoots.
957200	958200	These aren't canon.
958200	959200	Wait, hold on.
959200	960200	Hold on.
960200	961200	It's pseudo.
961200	962200	Wait a second.
962200	963200	Explain this to me.
963640	964640	They've got access to the...
964640	965640	Oh god, what's the English word?
965640	966640	You know, the list of things that's in the book.
966640	967640	But they don't have anything to do with the actual Lord of the Rings books.
967640	968640	They've got like the summaries and stuff.
968640	969640	Oh, but not the actual main stories.
969640	970640	Okay.
970640	971640	No.
971640	972640	Which means that they don't actually own hobbit hobbits,
972640	973640	and so these aren't hobbits.
973640	974640	These are harfoots.
974640	975640	And that's why they've specifically said, Lenny Henry here in fact specifically said,
975640	976640	that the harfoots weren't hobbits.
976640	977640	Now, that's bullshit according to the lore, but...
977640	978640	I don't know.
978640	979640	I don't know.
979640	980640	I don't know.
980640	981640	I don't know.
981640	982640	I don't know.
982640	983640	I don't know.
983640	984640	I don't know.
984640	985640	I don't know.
985640	986640	Like, Shunkus.
986640	987640	You guys were all thinking it.
987640	988640	Yep.
988640	989640	A little bit.
989640	1002000	Look at the way they're shooting this.
1002000	1004920	They're shooting from down and up all the time.
1004920	1009140	The hobbits don't look like hobbits, they look like, again, just fucking people.
1009140	1015360	Yeah, so I recall seeing a making of the original Lord of the Rings way back in the day.
1015360	1020400	showed like all the camera angle tricks to make um to make elijah wood look so much smaller than
1020400	1025280	everyone else right yeah they built the cart with like the seat in the back and like all that stuff
1025280	1030160	they really made them look like they were tiny people and this i don't get that feeling from
1030160	1038240	this at all why do you got leaves in your hair because they're quirky their culture it's their
1038240	1046320	culture basically it's a a very lazy way to make them look oh they're like either finicky
1046320	1053040	so i'm guessing they're like tree ground uh hobbits i'm guessing well the thing is
1053840	1060000	in the show they're described as no uh nomadic people that travel with the growing seasons
1060880	1065680	for all the sense that makes and they're supposed to be super stealthy so i'm assuming that's why
1065920	1073760	they've got branches in their hair oh that's their camo not wolf ah fuck me
1075520	1079200	i heard you're just gonna have an aneurysm watching this the thing is i'm not even the
1079200	1086080	biggest like lord of the rings lore fanboy person but it's just basic shit like this pisses me off
1086080	1093280	because they know this isn't a wolf and yet they call it a wolf anyways all wrong quote unquote
1093360	1101520	it doesn't look like l running mr anderson ah they're doing they're already sabotaging
1101520	1106480	his character how's that nice you know you notice that notice how he's already making errors and
1106480	1113040	scratching out words he's unrefined not thinking clearly his guidance from a strong female
1113040	1119600	character i mean i think aileron is already like a thousand years old but details details
1119600	1131920	the writers don't know that
1133520	1138160	wait this is the exact same as house of the dragon it's the same story where like the girl
1138160	1142720	the girl boss flies off in the dragon and gets the job done and comes back and the king is mad
1142720	1148080	that she did it all on her own but doesn't get recognized for her work yeah it's the same fucking
1148080	1153520	story it's it's the classic strong female character she's the only one who knows
1153520	1160880	and ever nobody believes her everybody else are morons she's gotta be proven right yeah everybody's
1160880	1167120	gonna be like oh you're right oh you know that story isn't necessarily bad john snow did that
1167120	1170480	was pretty well done with him and the white walkers it was well done in mass effect when
1170480	1175360	no one believed shepherd about the reapers but like yeah there are other stories you can do with
1175360	1180320	girl characters you know anime is full of stories you can do with girl characters there are but this
1180320	1187120	is the only strong female character hollywood knows like this is is their strong female character
1187120	1192160	sadly it's sadly true for a lot of mainstream writers and that's why we see it regurgitated
1192160	1196480	in multiple shows because they they're creatively bankrupt and they don't know how to write female
1196480	1198800	characters she's adventurous by the way
1205840	1212320	look she's female frodo oh my jesus she is well isn't this more isn't this more female
1212320	1216640	bilbo because frodo frodo was kind of reluctant to go on the journey actually yeah that's actually
1216640	1221200	more apt because bilbo was the one who had that wanderer's lust but was like holding himself back
1221200	1226400	and then finally gave in yeah frodo i mean i just watched fellowship the ring frodo he was more like
1227040	1232080	he did it because he was a good person he knew it had to be done but he didn't really want to
1233360	1237440	he was a reluctant hero but he understood that uh gandalf couldn't take the ring and that he
1237440	1248480	had to take it he was the ring bearer somehow i feel like you know adriel might have an objection
1249040	1256960	soon look at how mad she is yes jesus christ she's just fucking glaring
1259680	1262800	it's a ceremony for her you can at least be nice for the second right
1263920	1270000	wait i thought the whole point of this story was that everyone was going going to valinor yeah
1270800	1276480	no no the elves pursued across the sea and that's why they founded various elven kingdoms like
1276560	1281920	linden where they're right now because they were hunting the uh the things that were stolen by
1281920	1288480	oh fuck i can't remember but all elves have a calling to go back to valinor right you know i
1288480	1296240	will say like it it looks good a lot of the scene compositions are are the production i don't know
1296240	1302320	about the scene composition but like the production value is okay my annoyance is in the the lack of
1302320	1309360	the representation of these are not people i feel a bit too human yeah yep they're a bit stiff
1310880	1320240	like those wooden carvings oh god damn it but like galadriel is basically just ray
1321040	1325920	from from the star wars sequels that's fairly accurate i'd say just in different clothing
1326720	1332800	every female protagonist has to be ray no don't and uh if you have objecthood
1332800	1339840	you're a bigot and you hate strong empowered women obviously it is over the evil is gone
1343200	1348960	oh my god literally my feelings that's a you problem lady ah yes my lived experiences
1349440	1356960	what she ironically just pulled that well the problem too is galadriel has not
1357680	1364160	seen galadriel was not with the army galadriel has not fought sauron my friend
1367120	1369760	damn friend zone but the other way around
1370240	1372560	hahaha
1380240	1385280	i mean at least the map's done nicely that looks pretty nice but that's about it i want to run my
1385280	1394480	hand through it i'll bet it feels nice get your greasy paws off me map that's so textury it looks
1394480	1407040	very textory that's true i'm sorry kibs you racist you look at a black woman is this the
1407040	1413360	person to laughter i'm sorry but like when it comes to cultural you have this like european town
1414000	1420320	and then there's just a random black lady and she has like the black head scarf and and like the
1421040	1423040	like the circles hanging that's like an african thing
1424640	1427840	we just got random diversity scattered everywhere
1429600	1435120	and the worst part it feels like a quota doesn't it oh speaking of diversity hires we got a new
1435120	1443600	character it's a black elf so is he supposed to be some kind of dark elf or is it literally just
1443600	1455520	a black elf okay yep they're all fair-skinned also like i think they've made have fucked up
1455520	1461520	because they mentioned this is the south lands i mean this should be the lands of like
1462320	1466640	let it go i didn't see where the map was painting
1468800	1472560	now still honestly because uh this doesn't look like thinking
1473440	1479280	by the way racism is bad in case you were unaware racism is indeed bad
1480000	1485840	unless it's against elves thank you amazon prime for showing us i hate his hair most of all like
1485840	1491120	sure okay so he's black or portrait hold on look at his breastplate though what about it
1491120	1497680	it's made of wood or something it's made of plastic those are the finest costumes at spirit
1497680	1505280	halloween okay his hair is the thing that annoys me the most because okay he's like it's the
1505280	1509600	current year they've got to have black elbows because reasons but at least they could have
1509600	1517440	given him long flowing hair instead like he is the most anti-elf you can imagine like in in tone in
1517440	1523520	demeaner in appearance because elves are supposed to have long beautiful hair give him long dread
1523520	1531280	locks that's not beautiful we got an interracial relationship now yep kib called it kib genius
1532640	1538640	but another short-haired elf they all seem to be short-haired now pretty much really
1540400	1547200	the elves are talking about their life we gotta have vulgarity you know again they're just
1547200	1552240	people that's the thing they're just fucking people with people's concerns
1554480	1560400	they're just humans they're not even elves my point is that's a cool shot only twice
1560400	1566960	in known he waited till now to speak his point after like three hours of walking
1568800	1573440	listen you just wait for three hours you know my point is actually
1574400	1578480	it's like what what the fuck were you talking about maybe they're just elves from a different
1578480	1587120	region idk that region's called amazon land of amazon basil's high king
1589440	1595680	do you notice also every time they pronounce a name or a place name they change their
1595680	1601600	pronunciation drastically not only they can just talk always talk like that that's the problem
1602160	1607920	most of the time they speak like just regular fucking humans and then when they occasionally
1607920	1614240	inadvertently have to say something that's related to lord of the rings their pronunciation changes
1615200	1619920	to be fair arch you're barely speaking like a human right now damn he's more elf than these
1619920	1627360	characters she's got the hots for that black elf though look at her he knows
1627600	1632640	you know why are you at my home or make
1636400	1637600	oh jesus
1641840	1648960	that's fucking racist all right time for the the action to brew up fellas here we go
1649200	1650800	where are you going dramatic music
1653200	1657360	so obviously the cow's been grazing in corrupted lands
1659840	1664000	corrupted lands they're unaware of you know do they do any reconnaissance whenever we're
1664000	1670080	garrisoned here they just sort of chilled in their little fort and that just waited
1670080	1674400	yeah weren't they there for like 79 years or something they weren't patrolling around
1674400	1682640	attention they're just sitting there twiddling their thumbs it's a lie maybe that's why he's
1682640	1688960	a half no i'm sorry child then what happened to him his dad is the elf though you think so
1688960	1694160	this is the real bouncy that's why he's light brown that's racist kibbs race is a social
1694160	1702640	construct oh that's the evil looking sword he's got the sign sorry just stand there at attention
1705360	1708160	mean to be fair it's the most elven thing they've done so far
1708720	1712640	we wait in full armor what happens if you fall off the boat
1717360	1719920	very descriptive thank you strange how
1722320	1730080	on my way is there a tin can look like it like in the background i'm pretty sure that was a tin
1730160	1732480	can in the background there better than a starbucks cup
1738000	1740080	you're the only one who let me hit it
1742240	1745360	listen he's desperate okay well the warden's fucked up a bit
1749440	1752560	maybe you should have warned the garrison instead of your girlfriend
1753440	1757760	still standing there they've been standing there for fucking days
1761040	1767920	no one can take the sword from you no one's doing anything on the ship they're just standing see the
1767920	1774880	writers think that overs overly ceremonious will be very elven delicate i mean again to be fair
1774880	1779360	this is the most elven they've been so far yeah but even when they get on the ships to valinor
1779360	1787200	and the other movies like they don't wear their full battle garb no no but give them a point for
1787200	1795600	trying i don't give them a point for being amazon barge listen i like my knife i want to stab
1795600	1802720	somebody with it now this is actually a pro second amendment message never give up your arms damn
1802720	1812960	oh my god valinor is an arwelian nightmare so how does luminor work like uh like valinor
1812960	1818560	yeah that's i mean it's our valinor it's like the land of the see i'm not super familiar but
1818560	1823280	i've been starting to read up on the lore a lot more but basically it's like a magical land where
1823280	1827920	nothing dies and so that's why the immortals like elves that go there you know that's where
1827920	1833120	they belong they don't belong in middle earth i see it's the land of the valor the valor
1834160	1838080	so can just anybody sail there or do only elves though how to
1838560	1844480	uh only else mortals can exist in the land works there's sometimes rare exceptions but that's why
1844480	1850560	there's the van then alcom frodo was able to go there they made an exception for him because he
1850560	1855120	did and you know that was only because he was going to die anyways like he would die in valinor
1855760	1859600	it's a mercy because mortals aren't allowed to valinor because they apparently like it's sort
1859600	1865680	of alluded that they age too quickly but immortals are fine there it's also because it's nice to have
1865680	1872560	the ethnostates i think they brought all the ring bears so they brought frodo sam and bilbo
1874320	1878160	yep because like you guys are in it you can you can come on
1880560	1886400	you can join our ethno state you're your exception you guys are honorary ways you can come in
1886400	1897920	nice to follow yeah i reckon i can swim to shore from here i'll just jump out
1899520	1904400	like she literally did no way she's gonna swim all the way back home
1909120	1912720	do you understand writers how far she's gonna have to swim now
1913360	1919920	isn't like a thousand miles like she'll never make it of the atlantic ocean she'll never make
1919920	1924640	it because the currents would pull her away even if she swam as hard as she could that's fucking
1924640	1933040	horseshit she doesn't even have like a trifle to hold on to yeah she's basically dead so uh gg
1934160	1941360	you're dead dead if you do that the natural reaction to anyone seeing a meteorite crash
1941360	1946080	nearby wandered towards the burning wreckage especially if you're like a you know primitive
1946080	1953200	civilization you're not terrified or anything also what's in here what well first the meteorite
1953200	1961440	wouldn't look like this but i guess it's a person crying in the show that's how she's crying too
1961440	1967760	everybody's they have water in their eyes wait wait wait that that is sauron that is sauron
1968720	1974560	oh my episode two is up already what yeah yeah yeah so uh they did like an episode one and an
1974560	1985760	episode two in one day you gotta keep going kibs let's spend a few minutes talking about what the
1985760	1993600	fuck we just watched oh god because we watch okay here here's what a pilot's supposed to do right
1993600	1998400	introduce your characters introduce your setting introduce at least get the conflict started this
1998400	2001680	shouldn't be the first time you're exposed to what lord of the rings is it feels like because
2002320	2010480	this pilot relies on so much past knowledge of everything that's come before the only reason
2010480	2017600	that we care about any of this is because of the previous movies they didn't establish anything
2017600	2025600	that makes us care in this dev you're you're being facetious okay they introduced her brother for at
2025600	2035200	least five seconds and then he died hold on they introduced him he maybe had like two minutes or
2035200	2040640	five minutes of screen time before he died and they foreshadow his death in the introduction
2040640	2046000	to his characters like this story is so rushed like we should have gotten a whole like thing
2046000	2050320	about the the war of wrath rather than just like the war of wrath happened and it was bad
2050320	2057760	i was like okay but but yes so what what what happened in gladiator story she she went through
2057760	2063520	the ice she found evidence of sauron nobody believed her she went back she was being sent
2063520	2068480	away she refused and jumped into the ocean like that that's the tldr of it right but
2069200	2074480	yeah so sauron's returning and things are getting corrupted and all things are bad
2075120	2080880	yes so so the other stories actually had stuff kind of happening in them but it really seems
2080880	2087200	up something but like it's kind of setting up something but it doesn't make you care about
2087200	2091760	any of the characters beyond this is these are people that you already know from previous movies
2092720	2098080	because they're doing the same thing because the the completely new characters they're so bland
2098080	2104320	it's it's the same problem with house of dragons like you are expected to know
2105200	2109840	the reason why you should give a shit like you should care about galadriel because it's
2109840	2118480	galadriel it's given you no other reason to give a shit we also established um oh god elrond but
2118480	2123440	we also established i can't remember the guy's name let's call him black elf or belle for short
2123440	2129840	and we also established yeah belle and uh harfoot lady so we have three story arcs that have been
2129840	2134480	prepped so i somehow they're gonna all intermingle i think the harfoot one's gonna have something to
2134480	2140400	do with the sauron dude yeah i have a sneaking suspicion they're all gonna be kept completely
2140400	2144640	separate and i have another sneaking suspicion that they might actually be taking place at
2144640	2150560	vastly different times oh so that would be really weird well they did that with the witcher and it
2150560	2154240	was fine with the witcher with all the different time periods kind of shifting around fine and
2154240	2160080	fine it was it was a decent show the witcher i like the witcher come on you guys are being
2160080	2165760	apologetic just because henry kevl was in it that's it i've established it to be fair the
2165760	2172400	arrival of sauron is a pretty big deal and but he's not obvious he's the stranger this is part
2172400	2178000	of his ploy yep he's pretending he's gonna be he's gonna blend in with the rest of everyone
2178000	2181840	because he's gonna eventually slip his way to numenor and trick the numenorians into
2182400	2186720	trying to break the ban because they'll be like the elves are you know they're they're preventing
2186720	2190720	from going to valor because they're they're holding all their power and immortality and
2190720	2196880	he's like what really that's they're dicks i want the immortality they're why can't we have it arch
2196880	2201280	i know you and i disagree on house of the dragon like you think it's bad i think it's like okay
2201280	2206000	it's not amazing but it's okay i'm gonna beat you we're gonna beat you i feel like house of the
2206000	2211600	dragon actually set up its principal characters to have personalities way more than this because
2211600	2217920	we know that in that show the king is kind of weak and and he doesn't have a grasp on anything
2217920	2222640	we know that that the daughter is is is intelligent but overlooked we know that
2222640	2227760	her uncle he he's the evil uncle who wants the throne like they set up the characters
2227760	2232640	well enough that we can tell who they are based on personality i don't think this show did that
2233280	2238640	they all just seem to be the same bland person i feel like this show is kind of the same though
2238640	2244000	because this show is also and then and then and then and the house of dragon is and then and
2244000	2249120	then and then it tells us rather than really showing us and when it shows us it's overt
2249120	2252960	it's like look his fingers falling off look he knocked over a statue and broke it
2252960	2259840	seeing his house is coming undone foreshadowing it's a little too on the nose that's the thing
2260560	2265040	dev is actually correct here in that house of dragons has done more like it's
2265040	2271360	it's basic bitch shit the king is literally rotting to demonstrate that his realm is falling
2271360	2276960	apart the uh the princess is the only capable individual that can get anything done and her
2276960	2285760	uncle is like yes yes yes yes yes but at least those are characters galadriel's only character
2285760	2291360	here she is it was actually a brilliant uh comparison she is ray she is the cardboard box
2291360	2296640	that speaks she is strong female character and the other characters they they don't even exist
2296640	2302160	like elrond what we knew about elrond well he writes okay cool uh what about gilgalad well he
2302160	2308240	has like leaves that are made of gold uh he's a king and he's wrong actually that's what we know
2308880	2313360	the show hasn't even really told us about his position like what is he king of is this an
2313360	2319520	important title like is he respected well we kind of know he's king of linden because he's
2319520	2324880	in linden that's the thing you know he's king of linden well you'd assume he's king and he's also
2324880	2331280	in linden ads are but what's linden a normal person what's linden is that the entirety like
2331280	2336320	is that all of it they show you on the map what linden is it's next to ariador but the thing is
2336320	2339600	what they don't really show you is like the borders or anything like that yeah exactly and
2339600	2345200	what's ariador yeah it's like i mean the map has only panned past ariador it's never actually done
2345200	2350640	anything there it's just a thing on the map for the newcomer ariador means nothing and we also
2350640	2356720	introduced them to complete the other else i don't dare like okay who's he why why is he in the
2356720	2364640	southlands the southlands as well that is one hell of a skip and a jump and also they keep present
2364640	2370640	they're presenting the southlands as if they were like major allies to morgoth like they would
2370640	2377280	barely have counted in morgoth scheme like that was not a war of men like that was a war in which
2377280	2383360	balrogs were generals the if i remember right they were more like a vassal state fighting alongside
2383360	2389600	his forces but that's about it so for the elves to like set up a garrison there to police their
2389600	2395120	conquered subjects i don't really remember that being a thing because i i think like the only
2395120	2398720	time they're relevant again from what i know is when the numerians start you know setting
2398720	2403680	colonies and building up stuff over there and they've got a full site the worst part is too
2403680	2410000	i'm actually kind of annoyed they're white they should be brown yeah because we're in the south
2410000	2416160	lands these are the people of ruin right so it should be kind of like southerly like a little
2416160	2423520	bit arabic kind of yeah a mix of arab and mongol a little bit more instead they're just they come
2423520	2429920	across as like just european peasants yeah because yeah you're right so like european so i i don't
2429920	2435840	know the lore the way that that that archon kibbs does but i do know that there are certain places
2435840	2442640	where certain human races come from in lord of the rings and every population shouldn't just be
2442640	2448160	mixed race my impression of like southlands weren't they like the people on the boats that
2448160	2453600	showed up like uh at the third movie they have returned to the king they have like big elephants
2453600	2464800	hey yes those guys um actually those are different oh god because those i i know the name but i can't
2464800	2469600	bring it up because this is from the horadrim right yeah horadrim because this is actually to
2469600	2475920	the east the southlands is past the lands of mordor so this should not look like a european
2475920	2481280	village which is it's interesting isn't it like they've got a force in a black elf but in a
2481280	2487920	position where they could actually have a diverse village like now illy law europe the corsairs were
2487920	2492480	coming up the river or the direction where the river leads to goes to os giliath os giliath is
2492480	2497520	the former capital of gondor ministeroth is actually a uh like city fortress kind of thing
2498000	2501600	the that's the thing that the corsairs are actually white because they're full of
2501600	2507360	numerians oh yeah they are i forgot about that they're the black numerians right
2508400	2513280	yes also the black numerians aren't actually black by the way this is they call them black
2513280	2523200	because they turned evil that's racist i'm sorry but i'm not i don't dare and bronwyn
2523200	2528320	like their romance is not explained it's just like they they meet you see them by the well
2528320	2533360	and they're like i'd like to have sex with you i know but i can't see this is just modern writing
2533360	2537840	because it's the forced interracial relationship that does that comes out of nowhere in left field
2538640	2544560	it's not natural there's no buildup for it i mean galadriel got a prequel okay well introduce the
2544560	2549040	other characters then at the very least i don't they're like arriving you know looking around
2549040	2555520	uh being called a black person for a while then he goes like i think you're cute even though you're
2555520	2561040	black something like something to establish a relationship but they're kind of forcing it along
2561040	2567520	the show is rushing he said like you're the only kind touch i felt okay like there's i'm saying
2567520	2574320	i'm sensing that there's like an implied history between them but it's like we're not we're not
2574320	2580480	shown nor was it told well maybe maybe they'll show it to us that's we want to give him the
2580480	2586000	benefit of the doubt and maybe they'll get a flashback back yeah but that's gonna flashbacks
2586000	2591600	work sometimes for twists but this is kind of on the nose because i swear to god that kid that is
2591600	2597360	his kid you think so oh because his ears are being dead left yep his dad also left because of that too
2597360	2602240	remember and and his ears are all hidden by his hair you think it's gonna be i think i think the
2602240	2605760	elf dude's dad originally is gonna hate him and he's like i don't like you but they'd be like
2605760	2608960	actually you're my dad and you know what we're pretty cool actually and then they shake hands
2609760	2617280	he's also found the sword of sauron which is god damn it don't worry about it that's just
2617280	2625280	lying under the floor that's true most of sauron's artifacts kind of have a corrupting influence
2625920	2630720	well i mean it did kind of glow and look at him a bit that's true everybody's gonna turn evil
2631360	2639440	he's still fine this is the thing um well what they established in the uh original movie trilogy
2639440	2645920	boromir is tempted by the ring by just being near it he's willing to kill his compatriots
2645920	2651520	to her normal human touching an artifact of sauron should be a pretty fucking big deal
2652400	2658720	yep remember the council when they were in uh oh god uh the thing with the e basically
2658720	2663680	elrond's uh fortress city place and they were all fighting and bickering because the rings
2663680	2672480	influence is that powerful yeah yes i'm letting like the different magnitude again like the racist
2672480	2678480	boy look at the stories i was like oh i want it um but it's like the him holding it there's it
2678480	2683680	doesn't even look like it's having much of an effect on him yeah you think that he'd be like
2683680	2689120	instantly possessed or something or at least get like mind fucked should we start the second
2689120	2698160	episode are you ready to go yep might as well oh god here we go the last the evil is gone then why
2698160	2708000	is it not gone from in here i'm sorry oh the opening okay we didn't see it the first one
2708000	2708800	let's watch this shit
2711120	2716480	oh my god that the rings for me on a dust game or show well it's nice to have pebbles
2717280	2722080	yeah it's nicer than what twitter said it was yeah no that's not i thought it would be like
2722080	2729280	them fading in like that thing yeah where did that come from then maybe it was a trailer a fan edit
2730080	2736560	or maybe like 4chan did it to like shitpost i don't know ah she's realized that swimming for
2736560	2742640	you know three weeks straight is uh not working out oh glad you what um was your plan
2744800	2748720	that facial expression is the look of oops i'm a bit retarded oh she's just gonna swim it
2750320	2761040	yeah okay she's in in the lore she's a witch right can she cast water walk probably not
2761600	2769680	is this fucking dnd dev convenient underwear very convenient underwear looks you want
2770480	2775200	soran's first act of waking up is to end up in a sex offenders registry okay
2776960	2780560	in before yeah i was thinking like the gandalf too
2781360	2783360	oh
2793760	2797360	also not to mention there hasn't been a handsome elf in the show yet
2800640	2801520	i was about to say
2805120	2810400	the characters are comedically stupid good you know i'm okay if it's hobbits doing this though
2811520	2821040	uh they're harpots actually for legal reasons he's literally named the stranger

2829120	2836000	little nappy nap little sorrow nappies even dark lords got asleep somehow i just know he's
2836400	2843920	important hitler was important he is this literally is would you kill baby hitler this
2843920	2850960	is what's going on here damn pretty the show's asking the hard questions we've got female bilbo
2850960	2856560	and like a female sam they're even repeating some of their goddamn dialogue what's the old saying
2856560	2862960	if it ain't broke don't fix it no no it's a different saying it's like poetry it rhymes
2862960	2867760	god damn it that's fine oh shit my new twitter account's already locked fuck
2868480	2871200	well that's what you get for saying that that was god punishing you

2879120	2885040	no bodies you wanted to keep this pg-13 it's a pg-13 it is actually if you go back to the uh

2906480	2911920	meanwhile black don't think about it run back home in half the time and give me back again
2911920	2917920	before she was that's right they can run super fast they can yeah they've got great direction
2918800	2920480	my good erection
2936080	2940000	at least they're establishing the reason why he's going to be talked into making the rings
2947920	2952960	hot as a dragon's tongue and as pure as starlight the things we could use it to create could
2952960	2960320	transform middle earth nothing bad could ever be created from such a thing don't worry about it
2961360	2967360	have you considered seeking partners outside the confines of our own race feel far outside
2970080	2975120	you gotta be a free marketeer man they don't have montages for when they move across man they just
2975120	2981520	do it indiana jones town you notice that yeah i noticed they had montages they're not like
2981520	2988320	running across the plains anymore it's like uh it's like a loading screen it's like a little
2988320	2995200	picture all right yes calin broad one of the richest and most powerful influential individuals
2995200	3002880	in the entirety of elvenham walks to kazakhdum he's a simple man he wouldn't go on a cart with
3002880	3009440	a bunch of soldiers no luxuries no creature comforts it just not even backpacks how the
3009440	3014400	fuck did they eat wasn't there that special elf bread that keeps you fed yeah but how the fuck
3014400	3022640	much of it will it be carried beyond what you want it is elrond of lindon accompanied by calabrimbor
3022640	3032640	lord of oregano and no one else no all right okay i admit that was kind of funny
3033200	3041360	the dwarves are base now trust me is he gonna walk back again yep a few days all right go ahead and
3041360	3048160	walk back by the way all sorts out by myself i don't know why i brought you motherfucking what
3049440	3059040	so he came all the way out that's actually really like how many weeks must have taken
3060000	3062160	well he's walking back by himself
3064960	3068560	being the doors at their height is pretty cool yeah
3070640	3077680	are all the females beardless so what yeah this is a inconsistency like oh my god
3079760	3085440	isn't the tokens female dwarves like they're supposed to have like full beers yeah
3089440	3094160	they didn't have the stones motherfuck yeah they didn't have the stones to do it like the
3094160	3098640	witcher did i appreciated that which we saw the bearded dwarves they were female that was cool
3098640	3103280	problem is you've already established that he's going to get the workforce
3108880	3112480	yeah that's just the big problem with the prequels you already know what's going to happen right
3113280	3117200	yep oh black dwarfs good fantastic light
3119520	3124800	well you know what in warcraft they have the dark iron dwarves that are they're dark skinned
3124800	3130800	yeah they're literally evil yes they're actually an evil race like personally i disagree now but
3130800	3136320	if you want to say that all black people are evil then this is a hill you can die on dev you're
3136320	3145120	welcome to it looks like a comfy spot right here dev uh hello we're back to the fucking hobbits

3162560	3168880	it's gonna be her credit that the ring didn't affect uh frodo or something oh
3170160	3176880	she's gonna give sauron just enough love that the ring will have some kind of spell on it
3176880	3182080	that doesn't affect hobbits in the same way they're french right eat the snail
3184240	3190960	eat the bugs guys which animal finds the shell is it a snail or is it a crab because a crab

3252800	3258880	well we were complaining before that the elves just seemed like humans maybe this is maybe
3258880	3264000	this is how they make her seem like an actual elf they let her swim home absolutely i mean
3264000	3271680	no human would do this see beast shark in each year don't forget she's got to be a strong
3271680	3274160	independent women that's gonna be about
3277760	3285760	the horns or something or a shipwreck out here maybe they're the numerians
3287840	3289920	sailing west i don't know
3292320	3294560	that's a very convenient piece of wreckage

3369520	3376320	i don't know what i'll do oh she's gonna kill a thing yep name so they're all fuck because
3376320	3382240	they're it's okay they're racist they deserve it there's another raft because why not
3383600	3387760	now he attached his part he planned all of this beforehand you see
3392320	3394400	he's like all right i need to get laid come on board
3395200	3401360	um hello there offices mattress i'm the captain i feel like this is some sort of mini game
3402880	3407440	oh yeah this is when you just tap a a whole bunch to like gain your strength
3409120	3414640	this is the most engaging part of the story so far i think this is the most character moment
3414640	3421040	we've ever had in this show you know i kind of like it though it's something it's something
3421280	3426560	true he's weak-willed i can see the comedy god help me
3429120	3430480	what is that abomination
3432720	3444640	where's the beard told you to to stay out of my head the sargon heads it's a bit of a cameo
3444640	3448080	you know i would have asked sargon to show up but i think it's too late for him might be almost
3448080	3452720	early now well he has to like get up and go to work and he has a wife and kids too so
3452720	3454480	us neats don't have to worry about that
3460400	3468800	so there are no black doors in the lore are there no no i'll say this so far this is the best part
3468800	3476720	of the show at least they're lively they've got personalities yeah i like doors so far and plus
3476800	3483280	they don't look like people they look like dwarves but if only she had a beard i would
3483280	3490880	actually be happy with this scene yeah reacting skills are actually pretty good i like her as a
3490880	3497040	character yeah you know even though she was the face of so many so many derisions towards the
3497040	3502160	show she's actually a pretty enjoyable character yeah i'm not gonna lie surprised the thing is the
3502160	3508560	problem is she's an enjoyable character but she's still a middle finger to the very idea of tolky
3508560	3514480	all they would have to do is paste a fucking fake beard on her and she'd be a great character like
3514480	3520880	that is insult in and of itself also y'all put her in white face yes are we good too
3520880	3523600	is
3526480	3531600	wait what is she pulling on here i'm not sure what she's doing
3538880	3544800	the acting director was like look like you're doing semen things so she's like okay i have
3544800	3551840	no idea what i'm doing it's just a stick that's what she's talking on it's just a stick
3551840	3556320	it's just a stick it's just a stick i don't know what she plans to do with it
3559440	3565600	dame better hope that uh it's just a snake like look at that shot she's just talking
3566240	3573200	fucking stick yeah listen what else you're gonna do on that boat a raft she's trying to she looked
3573200	3580160	dizzy in a shot okay so that's what matters we've got a running montage my god oh never mind it's
3580160	3587920	over evil things are happening
3590960	3598240	hey you kind of match the music stone good job thank you hold on you didn't run to the garrison
3598240	3604960	you run to the bar yep all right unarmed peasants it's the only set they have
3607360	3613920	how do you know that we must spread the word no i will not have this gossip runwin i've seen
3613920	3620560	landslides less dangerous than a wayward tongue without proof oh god it's galadriel all over again
3620560	3626320	she knows the truth and the men won't listen we've done this story before show this story
3627120	3628400	they really like using the same
3645360	3649280	that's a bloody big mice you know when i first saw this tunnel like
3649280	3655040	in the previous scene for some reason i was thinking um fire ants from fallout
3655040	3660000	getting around down there yeah actually i heard a rumor that making a fallout show
3660000	3665040	yeah that's gonna suck the set leaked oh god and it's set in new jersey at least it's mostly
3665040	3672080	destroyed already i mean it's in a wasteland i'm pretty sure elves are supposed to have
3672080	3676800	pretty good night vision so why is he giving away his position by carrying a fucking lantern
3676800	3682320	in the dark ass tunnel okay
3685200	3690880	yeah just keep swimming my dude i'm i'm sure this uh comes up somewhere yeah swim
3690880	3696240	into an underwater oh jesus christ oh that was lucky ah this is the jump scare scene
3697360	3702960	is there a jump scare scene there's jane behind him
3703840	3714400	oh jesus that was so painfully obvious too now she's running home bitch garrison well to be fair
3715600	3721440	like that is where her son is yeah but but but she didn't go here first though either you go
3721440	3728960	to get your kid or you go to get the soldiers you wouldn't go to the bar first yes yeah she
3728960	3732400	went into the bars only to be told oh you're a woman you don't know what you're talking about
3733040	3742160	you're wrong she's tried that already she fucked up she went to the wrong group damn
3742160	3748640	he was like oh you're gonna hide in the closet okay but she has no idea what's in the hole
3748640	3753120	like she'd be safer running we need to have a scary scene though where she's scared in the closet
3753840	3762640	do we do we really that sound right now that sound is the creaking of their rubber suits
3763680	3764960	oh my god lol
3769040	3773120	here it comes yep i think he called it very soon
3774000	3781120	oh it's a soft dress oh no
3787680	3793120	that is a remarkably uh
3793200	3800400	oh jesus okay so this is getting a bit
3805440	3808000	it's just like they're not
3809920	3815600	it's just that they're not a superhuman uh actually apparently they are according to the amazon
3818000	3821920	oh excuse me boy i'm entailed by a fucking metal sword so you know
3823920	3826320	oh strong independent woman
3828560	3836640	why first light i was right there damn strong female wait wait hold on hold on hold on
3836640	3842160	jesus christ this is loud in that scene there was light coming in through the windows in the
3842160	3848640	bar wouldn't you just go now no damn the town's about to go no we gotta wait till the last second
3849280	3854720	we need to get that attention why did they give the goblins a chance to attack them yeah it's not
3854720	3859200	fair dev some of the characters need to die off so they can you know get rid of them gotta make the
3859200	3864960	stakes seem high so it's just very clear why like she went to the bar first it's so she can have
3864960	3868320	that i told you so a little bit yeah yes that was the only reason
3868320	3878000	oh
3887840	3894400	yeah and she's just gone here she goes she's like sinking like a rock now she's tangled
3895200	3898160	yeah good job that's a very good idea woman
3901200	3906160	alla branda says like should i shave her i mean she didn't have sex with me so maybe she's not
3906160	3911600	worth it yeah she kind of she was a little bit but she might have a bit of a prude but yeah that's
3911600	3917360	right she's right though she might because she did say bind see he misinterpreted it
3917360	3927920	you could just haul up the rope fucker oh cop in a feel i see you'll have to sleep with me now
3928640	3934640	i'm gonna take her sword yeah just mind you dagger actually listen he's awake again
3934640	3938240	she passed out a second ago but i guess all about fresh air mister revitalized her
3939680	3941760	oh yeah yeah the fresh air underwater
3943840	3945120	find yourself to me this time
3945120	3951120	oh my god so she was like unconscious underwater and he had to be helped in the end
3955360	3958960	they probably rewrote the scene because like oh it's we can't have the men being strong
3960080	3966800	erases it this is just the hippie commune it's a lantern we use fireflies
3968480	3970000	that's a lot of fireflies in there
3970000	3976000	oh my god he's whispering to like gandalf i clapped when i saw it
3987680	3995840	how did you get to that conclusion the writers needed us to okay damn the bugs died they all
3995840	4006400	just fucking died are dead but the ones inside her lantern are okay yeah yeah magic protected
4006400	4012240	them i guess how many fireflies you got to collect to put in there that's like a several day project
4013280	4017360	well that sucks for them i guess digging to the bell rock
4017840	4018340	okay
4021520	4022880	oh it's the arkenstone
4029680	4036240	are you gonna clap when you see it kibs remember it's dipper dipper not gonna show it though they're
4036240	4042000	too much of a no they didn't show it they didn't have that copyright either they're trying so hard
4042000	4046800	with the member berries it's not even funny do is behaving remarkably calmly for a person with
4046800	4053840	an orc hole in his house they just moved a table over it it's fun it reacts to his blood interesting
4055200	4060080	also did it draw the rolling back or something oh it is yeah reconstructing itself
4061760	4064800	yeah there's definitely something wonky going on with this guy
4066000	4068800	he's a guest mother i will command the old legion soon what
4068800	4076880	i'm calling it numen orient i better be right or barges getting beaten
4079760	4082000	nah this is the end of the episode that's what this is
4087360	4093760	okay so i'd sum that up as a lot happened and nothing happened kibs stop it
4093760	4101120	i can't i'm too lazy he's like how can you be this crazy do i hear noises
4103680	4109840	no it's your imagination yeah the trailer is playing for some reason why is it playing how
4109840	4114240	is it even whatever if i click this button and then pause it and then it will shut up
4114800	4124320	all right yes so episode two we one and two two punch double feature uh-huh that was two
4124320	4132160	hours of my life and i do not feel particularly enriched yeah i kind of i kind of like i don't
4132160	4139920	feel anything really i feel apathy actually about the whole show honestly see like it wasn't
4140480	4146080	a so bad it's good kind of thing you know it was just kind of you know i don't want to be
4146080	4155040	too mean to it i i'm i there was parts of it i liked i'm mildly entertained but yeah like
4155040	4160480	the village setting was so boring yeah like when the galadriel was like nah i'm a swim home
4161280	4169280	yeah that was like that was pretty good hey at least it went as horribly as you'd expect except
4169280	4174080	for you know randomly stumbling brilliant ideas after brilliant ideas this episode like tying
4174080	4181200	herself oh fuck she's like she's been a fuck up this whole time even as the show is trying to
4181200	4186240	tell us that she's implacable and infallible yeah i tried to make her feel like oh she's so smart
4186240	4191520	she knows she's she's right all along is this like and she just it feels like she's just been
4191520	4199040	handed the idiot ball tie yourself to the sinking rack jump into the unending ocean
4199680	4207920	bind yourself to me strong women sinks the symbolism there pull on the stick on on your raft
4208480	4216080	thing the only thing i've enjoyed so far are the dwarves like everything else interesting
4217040	4222080	i like the dwarven city that was like underground and stuff i thought i thought that was cool
4222800	4226480	a little bit of effort actually went into it as well like the images there
4229120	4235360	they had the adorvan like like uh agriculture and like the waterfalls is showing them how how
4235360	4240720	they get food down there it's just like how they live they're showing how they bring light down
4240720	4246960	yeah that's interesting but what is this like just wish we'd seen more of that and we've seen
4246960	4253600	more of that everywhere with like the elven setting and like the human setting even like
4253600	4262480	the human setting doesn't have to be just boring european-esque village it's just but it is but it
4262480	4268480	is yep yeah everyone's choreography is probably the strongest in this entire show and the rest
4268480	4275440	are just kind of wet farts okay that's the problem with the timing here so this is very
4275440	4281280	early for the humans and you see those original hunters and they look very savage like wearing
4281280	4286960	retarded hordes for some reason and yet their civilization is actually pretty fucking advanced
4286960	4291840	like they've got tons of stone structures they're living in settled villages they've got livestock
4291840	4295600	like it's not terribly far off because remember the the humans that helped the elves were gifted
4295600	4300960	that thing barch numenor and so they're on their little island of numenor and this is like their
4300960	4306560	golden age but it's also coming to an end because everything's about to go south well that's another
4306560	4311440	thing too humans and numenoreans are not the same thing either like the numenoreans are superior
4311440	4318640	species wow do you hear this oh my god i mean they lived for 200 years i think that qualifies
4318640	4328720	well hold on arch are they white yes but yes but by now their their lifespans are beginning
4328720	4332960	to shrink and that's where the jealousy is going to kick in they're starting to forget about the
4332960	4338480	whole everything about the ban on balanor and everything else they become arrogant and decadent
4338480	4342160	and i think that's what the show is going to probably show what do you what do you all think
4342160	4350560	of hobo sauron he feels like he he isn't there for any reason other than they were like where we
4350560	4358240	can't have hobbits somehow but how do we make them relevant i know sauron so the hobbits help sauron
4358240	4366480	so you're sorry the harfoot i did the harp like i called it like i am i am seriously calling it
4366480	4371760	like they're gonna do something and they're gonna like help in some way sauron to life
4371760	4376400	it's gonna all be thanks to nori that frody was able to frodo was able to carry the ring
4376400	4381680	it was actually nori the real hero that's what's gonna be sauron's master plan for rebuilding the
4381680	4386240	world was actually like yes i'll help the hobbits because they were my loyal allies and then frodo
4386240	4394160	fucking throws the ring and there's like god why i trusted you oh god what if it turns out
4394160	4399760	yeah let's put the most retarded possible theories okay it's gonna turn out that she
4399760	4406880	that she dies and then reincarnates as frodo he kind of looks a little bit like
4409200	4413440	so actually frodo was had the spirit of a girl the whole time
4413440	4416560	all right just gonna continue doing this as more episodes come out
4417760	4422640	if you want to we can keep doing it every week but jesus this is painful to watch
4423280	4428480	well at least next week it'll be uh only an hour only an hour instead of because there'll be one
4428480	4435200	episode right yeah about an hour long uh this was quite a time dedication but i don't mind
4436400	4441680	like watching anything is like no matter how bad as long as we're watching with like people it can
4441680	4448160	be fun yeah how long is this season because we we haven't even seen isoldo or elendil or
4448160	4454480	eight episodes it's eight episodes in i believe it's eight episodes so six left okay so we're
4454480	4460480	we're a fourth in we haven't even met half of the main characters listen arch they're gonna milk
4460480	4469360	this for five god damn seasons five seasons they're gonna try to drag their heels oh my god
4469360	4476480	amazon lord of the rings a hundred years amazon is warty lord of the rings amazon bought the
4476480	4482880	television rights for lord of the rings for 250 million dollars in 2017 and then set up a five
4482880	4489360	season production worth at least one billion dollars this is the most expensive tv series
4489360	4494800	ever made jesus christ you know what it feels like it feels like a big web meh like there's
4494800	4501040	a lot of production budget stuff in here but by and large my my overall feeling is like like
4501920	4508320	it fine again it's it's the lack of soul like what they're making here is it's it's a lot of
4508320	4514160	the rings we're told but what except actually the dwarves the dwarves are the only thing that
4514160	4519680	i've looked at so far and gone yeah lord of the rings everything else is just people in costumes
4519680	4529920	pretending yeah the elves are just like slightly arrogant like people with pointy ears yeah and
4529920	4535600	their original ears are even all that pointy there there's no magic here like there's no
4536720	4544240	lord of the rings there's no wonder there's no creativity and i die the elves again gill
4544240	4549760	fucking galad is supposed to be one of the mightiest individuals on the side of good like
4549760	4556080	he's a fucking warrior king and he's just some fucking dude like only noticeable because he's
4556080	4564160	probably the only elf with semi-long hair yeah he's just he's just like important elf guy and
4564160	4569200	that's about it wait what what if it what if it what if you know how the elves live for thousands
4569200	4576560	of years right what if it just turns out that elven hair grows so slowly that they just can't
4576560	4582000	grow long hair yet a lot of the younger ones yep it's gonna take him another 100 years another
4582000	4588000	thousand years ago gladriel have long hair like galadriel has long hair as a child that's true
4588000	4593040	oh dev you've been defeated oh yes well hold on hold on as a child though she's an elf she could
4593040	4599680	have been like 60 in that who knows i've been wrecked never hold on hold on hold on does that
4599680	4606560	mean that the loli the loli at the start of the show is legal no dev no that's not
4606640	4616960	oh and thus the end of the series began yeah it it feels like we're just kind of spinning our
4616960	4622880	wheels here you know like two two hours into a show you should you should have more stuff going
4622880	4628160	on than this in my opinion something should be happening so far the most dramatic thing that's
4628160	4633920	happening is that there are probably goblins and they're probably gonna attack some village of
4633920	4639920	humans in the middle of fucking nowhere of no relevance to anyone yeah why are we supposed
4639920	4648080	to care about this village uh because uh dude with the sauron sword there you go yeah i guess
4649600	4654000	it's the only thing i can think of of you three which of you actually watched the kenobi show
4655360	4659600	we all did i have you all did okay yeah and and you know that i made my big
4660240	4666080	giant essay my two and a half hour long video on kenobi okay um i hope you watched it it took me
4666080	4671280	like three weeks to make it but and all all you listening out there too you better watch it too
4671280	4679200	but i do want to point out um one thing i noticed with kenobi is that if you cut all the fat out of
4679200	4685600	it it's like an okay story it's not great because and that's why i mentioned in that video that
4685600	4690400	there's a guy who took all the all the footage cut it into a two and a half hour movie and it
4690400	4698640	was fine and the more that i watch new tv i'm realizing like for some reason all these new
4698640	4705120	shows they just move so slowly and i think they're trying to mistake moving slow for being epic or
4705120	4710400	they're making that mistake rather and it's like you know sometimes like i i get it like you have
4710400	4715440	a huge story in a massive world and you want to really take it in but you can't just do nothing
4715440	4721200	you know you you the problem is too there is superfluous characters like out on there and
4721200	4729680	bronwyn i don't fucking care halbrand who the fuck is that halford's what it's like we can cut
4729680	4737040	a lot of these characters just right out i have a feeling that after this season is over someone's
4737040	4742160	gonna cut this into a movie like kenobi and it'll probably be like an okay lord of the rings film
4742160	4747680	not gonna be great but it'll be okay if they were just focusing on elrond so far i would have been
4747680	4753040	like okay that was all right like elrond's character he uh he is not elrond like he he
4753040	4760560	cannot follow up agent smith he just kind of brim bore too is just again all of these characters
4760560	4766320	are deeply flawed because they're just fucking people like there's nothing elven about them
4766880	4773280	i don't really never feel feel the majesty as much as when when like um witnessing the elves
4773280	4778800	as they were portrayed in the movies this has none of the mad juice there's there's no like
4779360	4785520	yeah there's no like glow or like ethereal aspect about them they're just like well also
4787680	4792240	what helped is that aside from legolas you didn't see much of them they were there for a few scenes
4792320	4796320	and they would like flow around they would like kind of glide around the place and that would
4796320	4800080	be about it because if you see too much of them you realize that they are just people
4800080	4804640	there's also the style in which it is shot like the lord of the rings movies are very
4805680	4813600	warm kind of a little bright almost they're very magical and inviting they're in color whereas
4813600	4818480	here you've got the classical fucking tv show where everything looks fucking cold and dark
4818480	4826320	and grim and realistic and yeah i guess that's just like the 2020 look yeah well it the 2020
4826320	4833680	look is like the inheritor of the 2008 fallout 3 brown and bloom look you know we're to make it
4833680	4837440	look more realistic they just make it look darker and it's like well sometimes you can make things
4837440	4841920	pretty bright and it looks pretty good sometimes you have to have the you know that spark of hope
4842720	4851120	looks cold and boring and sickly like this is the least majestic person imaginable just a
4851120	4856000	drenched house cat well to be fair she is swimming back home that's true
4860160	4864240	yes the entire length of the island i want to point out that none of that happened in
4864240	4870880	the original lore though like this is all well because that's stupid this is all a ridiculous
4870880	4876800	contrivance to have her in the middle of the ocean to meet halibran who's drifting
4879440	4885200	don't worry about it don't think about it as for what i think is good you know i i i'm also
4885200	4890240	enjoying the dwarf storyline they have character i like i like them uh them getting along with
4890240	4896640	alrond um i don't mind the hobo sauron stuff i can see what they're going for and what they're
4896640	4902160	going for could actually be quite quite good they're just not doing it that well but like the
4902160	4908160	the the the the bone of the story is is actually decent it's it's the galadriel stuff that just
4908160	4914880	seems to be a complete fucking train wreck the galadriel thing is a train wreck and black elf i
4914880	4922720	just don't care about that's right i forgot about him i didn't even mention him the worst part is
4922720	4930560	right now he was in a hole he was in a hole yeah he's just he just fucked up yeah he's just gone
4930560	4934800	because the problem is this is actually only going to get worse because right now we have village in
4934800	4940960	the middle of bumfuck nowhere story arc we have elrond story arc we have galadriel story arc and
4940960	4946800	we're gonna get elendil story arc and isildur story arc and the queen lady as well like we're
4946800	4955520	only going to get more characters disparate spread across this huge universe i can only
4955520	4962880	hope that the converge at some point but like well it is a lot to keep track of all at once
4962880	4967280	i think everyone just wants to do game of thrones now you know yeah that was a big thing with a
4967280	4971040	billion characters like we can just do that just introduce a shit ton of people it's like well
4971600	4974480	game of thrones worked for a specific reason and it only kind of worked at the end
4975280	4980800	yeah and it fails too i remember very vividly reading through the last like couple of game
4980800	4985200	of thrones books and thinking to myself god could you fuck off i want to get back to the characters
4985200	4990640	i care about yep oh bloat of characters just because you have lots of characters your story
4990640	4997440	doesn't inherently mean good care a good story or an epic for that matter well is that all we
4997440	5005360	have to say about this is this is this the end my final verdict is meh not worth a billion dollars
5005920	5010160	no not worth about jesus christ not worth a billion dollars um how about this considering
5010160	5017280	that uh you know august and early september seems to be just a torrent of shit is this as bad as
5017280	5021360	the other shows that have recently come out that are everyone's talking about right now oh god this
5021360	5027920	is nowhere near as bad as halo or as fucking kenobi like this is just mediocre or or is she
5027920	5034880	hulk she hulks a fucking nightmare jesus i dare not watch that oh no i i watched the first episode
5034880	5038560	and i was like i can't i can't i can't fucking like naomi refused to watch it with me she was
5038560	5043520	like nope not the same well because her and i we sat down to watch the halo show because she was
5043520	5048320	like an xbox kid growing up so she said i want to watch halo so we watch it and it was like a fucking
5048320	5054720	there's a fucking holocaust watching that thing the i think it depends on the scale you're judging
5054720	5061680	it by because pablo schreiber the tv show was bad in that it wasn't about halo in the slightest it
5061680	5068960	was a story about pablo traveling the galaxy it was it was just a and kenobi was the same kenobi
5068960	5074240	has nothing to do with selves it is a just a big fat middle finger to the star wars universe where
5074240	5080960	every character acts like a complete fucking retard like the organa's calling kenobi on his
5080960	5087280	phone like again and again i know you're in hiding and shit but he is in danger what is this thing
5087280	5093440	this thing is just bloat it is mud like i can't even judge it because i don't even know what's
5093440	5098880	fucking happening the character's stories have progressed not at all like galadriel's story is
5098880	5103600	the one that's progressed the most and the only thing that's happened there is she knows silence
5103600	5108400	alive nobody believes her and she jumped in the ocean like two hours later she's finally
5108400	5114560	being recovered from the ocean this whole show just feels like just sort of forgettable and i
5114560	5118160	think that's probably i think that makes it arguably worse than the other ones because
5118160	5123920	they're memorable because they're about there this show there's nothing really to talk about
5123920	5129840	like it's just kind of it's there it's it goes at the pace of a snail and it's not very good
5129840	5133040	do you know what it reminds me of you know what reminds me of it reminds me of the um the new
5133040	5138800	harry potter movies the wizarding world movies right um the um the fantastic beast they're
5138800	5142640	trying to make that into a series and no one really cares and i've seen a couple of them
5142640	5146720	and they're not bad movies they're just very forgettable movies no one's gonna no one's gonna
5146720	5150320	remember those in 20 years the way they'll remember harry potter like the originals and
5150320	5155040	that'll probably be the same with this in 20 years time no one will be right we'll be re-watching
5155040	5159600	this shit but they'll re-watch the original movies yeah people will remember the good stories
5159600	5166080	no one will remember these things like kenobi even halo they'll be forgotten yep and it has to
5166080	5172000	do with the lack of soul because you look at this and it tells you it's lord of the rings like the
5172000	5176080	characters have the names of the lord of the rings they even have the little stairs and shit but
5176080	5182480	there is nothing lord of the rings here like there is no magic majesty there's no mystery there's
5182480	5188800	nothing that makes you feel like this is a lord of the rings property beyond names and set pieces
5188800	5193440	i mean i i would i wouldn't i wouldn't use sargon's term the progressive skin suit for
5193440	5197520	this one i don't really see it fully but it's a skin suit of some type that's for sure i'll
5197520	5204160	give it this much like as in terms of actual story there hasn't been any obvious progressivism
5204160	5211120	beyond every female character being the only competent people in the room but yeah so that's
5211120	5217760	the current year and the diversity hires but again that's behind the scenes politics the show itself
5218400	5225600	hasn't got any like political views so far it doesn't i guess i noticed i didn't bring it up
5225600	5231680	but i noticed one but i it's only like half a political view you'll notice that like all of the
5231680	5236480	all the not hobbits they're all very isolationist and i was like are they are they are they going
5236480	5242320	to do that do a trump thing later about about yeah but the hobbits are the isolationists yeah
5242320	5245760	yeah but that's why i didn't bring it up because i was like maybe maybe not but there are hobbits
5245760	5247760	they're hobbits tm there's not hobbits
5254720	5260240	well it is midnight and i need to i need to edit this all night and then put it up tomorrow and
