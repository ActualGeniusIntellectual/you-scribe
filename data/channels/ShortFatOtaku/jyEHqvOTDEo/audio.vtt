00:00.000 --> 00:08.080
As you can see by that timer on the screen, the Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power

00:08.080 --> 00:09.680
comes out in 45 seconds.

00:09.680 --> 00:10.680
Are you guys ready?

00:10.680 --> 00:11.680
No.

00:11.680 --> 00:12.680
We can't wait.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.680
This is good.

00:13.680 --> 00:18.120
And I say that with a full sarcasm.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.200
I'm here with Lilith and Arch and Kibs.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.200
Hello everyone.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.200
How's it going?

00:22.200 --> 00:23.200
Hello everyone.

00:23.200 --> 00:24.480
Arch and Kibs.

00:24.480 --> 00:29.280
So last night I watched the Fellowship of the Ring extended edition with Naomi just

00:29.280 --> 00:33.160
to have like a taste of something good before I knew this was going to come out.

00:33.160 --> 00:34.320
And you know what?

00:34.320 --> 00:35.320
It still holds up.

00:35.320 --> 00:39.580
It's a bit goofy in that 1999 way, but it still holds up generally.

00:39.580 --> 00:40.580
You know what I mean?

00:40.580 --> 00:43.880
It's going to be a classic probably for all time, honestly.

00:43.880 --> 00:45.920
Peter Jackson did a good job with those movies.

00:45.920 --> 00:50.880
The first three are just always going to be like the Lord of the Rings movies.

00:50.880 --> 00:51.880
Yeah.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.120
Before the movies, I actually really wasn't that interested in Lord of the Rings.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.680
I became interested in it after.

00:55.680 --> 01:07.480
In fact, my first Lord of the Rings experience was that god-awful Super Nintendo game, which

01:07.480 --> 01:10.680
turned me off of the entire franchise for like a decade.

01:10.680 --> 01:11.680
Damn.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.680
I don't even know what game you're talking about.

01:12.680 --> 01:14.500
Why is there an animated series?

01:14.500 --> 01:17.880
The fucking animated movies.

01:17.880 --> 01:23.800
Oh yeah.

01:23.800 --> 01:27.600
They're definitely products of their time because the style is ancient, but they are

01:27.600 --> 01:28.600
one-of-a-kind movies.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.520
I forget the name of the animator who did that.

01:30.520 --> 01:36.120
I remember being super scared of Sauron as a kid.

01:36.120 --> 01:43.960
Like when Sauron came on, my eyes would just be fixed like, oh, he's looking at me.

01:43.960 --> 01:44.960
Well now he's M&M.

01:44.960 --> 01:47.600
That might be a priest of Melkor.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.600
Maybe.

01:48.600 --> 01:49.600
We'll see.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.840
There's conflicting stuff about it, but if that's what Sauron looks like, I'm going to

01:52.840 --> 01:53.840
lose my shit.

01:53.840 --> 01:58.920
At some point, I'll have to do like an actual proper video about this show.

01:58.920 --> 02:03.600
This is just going to be like our series debut watch party since we're all hanging out tonight

02:03.600 --> 02:04.900
and watching it.

02:04.900 --> 02:09.760
But I mean, there's been so much stuff coming out about just how bad the show looks, how

02:09.760 --> 02:11.680
the costumes are shit.

02:11.680 --> 02:16.560
Apparently the intro looks like it's something out of a daytime soap opera.

02:16.560 --> 02:19.480
It's a drastic variation in color.

02:19.480 --> 02:20.480
Right.

02:20.480 --> 02:21.560
I've seen the intro.

02:21.560 --> 02:23.040
It looks like a complete joke.

02:23.040 --> 02:26.800
Are we going to watch like some step wives slapping each other?

02:26.800 --> 02:27.800
Nice.

02:27.800 --> 02:28.800
What's going on here?

02:28.800 --> 02:31.960
Dude, if you could have two elven wives, wouldn't you?

02:31.960 --> 02:33.960
Elves are for enslaving.

02:33.960 --> 02:37.900
They're going to get canceled.

02:37.900 --> 02:42.760
It's the variation in the quality that I think has stood out the most to a lot of people

02:42.760 --> 02:45.480
because some of the gear does not look bad.

02:45.480 --> 02:48.280
Like Galadriel's plate armor looks like plate armor.

02:48.280 --> 02:50.800
She shouldn't be wearing it, but beyond that.

02:50.920 --> 02:56.180
And then you've got that lamellar style armor that the Numenoreans wear, which looks like

02:56.180 --> 03:01.480
some kind of a t-shirt with a scale male pattern painted onto it.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.480
Oh, I saw that.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.480
Yeah.

03:03.480 --> 03:04.480
I don't get it.

03:04.480 --> 03:05.480
Why does it look like cheap?

03:05.480 --> 03:11.360
This is like an Amazon Prime show, isn't it right?

03:11.360 --> 03:14.720
Like you would imagine they have lots of lots of money.

03:14.720 --> 03:20.760
You would think they'd be able to afford to pay the say custom designers a little more.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.160
You definitely think, yeah.

03:22.160 --> 03:26.640
But the one thing I will say, you could definitely tell, at least from the trailer, the hand-picked

03:26.640 --> 03:31.520
CGI scenes, like there was a serious amount of effort and money put into those.

03:31.520 --> 03:35.760
When they're like, here's the trailer shots that will make everyone want to watch this.

03:35.760 --> 03:40.680
There's a bunch of CG and then a bunch of characters that just look really cringy.

03:40.680 --> 03:42.840
Yeah, the character designs are bad.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.360
The CGI scene shots don't look half bad.

03:45.360 --> 03:49.320
Yeah, we're going to have to see how this all comes together, and I'm a little bit skeptical

03:49.320 --> 03:50.640
about this whole show.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.440
I think it's just going to be a train wreck, honestly.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.040
Hopefully it'll be a fun train wreck.

03:54.040 --> 03:56.040
I'm hoping in mind, maybe.

03:56.040 --> 04:05.160
I'm hoping it won't be as bad as everybody's is, but it probably will be in all that likelihood.

04:05.160 --> 04:09.000
If it is, okay, if this is a train wreck, it's going to be a train wreck that we're

04:09.000 --> 04:12.320
going to have to live with for five seasons because they've already ordered five seasons

04:12.320 --> 04:13.320
of it.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.080
I can't, like if it's bombs, they're going to cancel it.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.080
I hope to God.

04:18.080 --> 04:23.440
This is the survival of Amazon Studios on the line.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.800
This will not be canceled.

04:25.800 --> 04:29.320
They will push this turd almost no matter what.

04:29.320 --> 04:36.680
Well, there was one that basically said that this will determine prime video going forward.

04:36.680 --> 04:39.560
There's the meme of everyone saying, no fucking hate watching.

04:39.560 --> 04:40.560
Sorry, guys.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.240
We're doing it so that you don't have to, okay?

04:42.240 --> 04:45.280
We'll do it because we're the YouTubers, okay?

04:45.280 --> 04:47.960
You guys, no fucking hate watching out there, all right?

04:47.960 --> 04:48.840
Yeah.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.840
Special exception for us because we're part of the elite now.

04:51.840 --> 04:55.680
Dev laughs, but he's like, yeah, that's true.

04:55.680 --> 04:56.680
We are the new bourgeois.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.040
It doesn't work.

04:59.040 --> 05:07.400
Not like refusing to watch it isn't going to work because we make up 0.0000% of Amazon's

05:07.400 --> 05:09.080
market cap here.

05:09.080 --> 05:10.480
That's not going to make a difference.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.680
Us watching it and honestly reviewing it will.

05:13.680 --> 05:17.400
Yeah, it's true because people will see the review and then be like, oh, well, this sucks.

05:17.400 --> 05:21.320
And then if you have 10,000 of those or 100,000 bad reviews, that does add up.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.840
You have the Gronton Tomato scores and stuff.

05:22.840 --> 05:28.880
Those 100,000 bad reviews is far more powerful than 100,000 people who didn't watch it.

05:28.880 --> 05:32.840
That's one of the reasons why I felt compelled to do the Kenobi video, even though it was

05:32.840 --> 05:35.880
kind of a little bit old by the time I did it, I was like, you know what?

05:35.880 --> 05:38.560
I should try my hand at doing this sort of thing.

05:38.560 --> 05:42.120
So Kibs, Kibs is the one controlling the video feed.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.440
We're already 10 minutes behind.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.440
You're ready?

05:44.440 --> 05:46.440
Kibs, Twitter already knows about this.

05:46.480 --> 05:50.960
Kibs, I'm letting you Twitter already knows we have to catch up if you have to be involved

05:50.960 --> 05:51.960
in the newest thing.

05:51.960 --> 05:57.160
I have to get I have to figure out how this works even because it's like the episodes

05:57.160 --> 05:58.160
are out.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.280
There it is.

05:59.280 --> 06:00.280
They just came out.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.040
Let's watch this shit.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.040
Here we go.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.040
It's starting.

06:04.040 --> 06:09.020
I also have the pleasure to announce that the episodes are already up on the torrent

06:09.020 --> 06:10.520
sites as well.

06:10.520 --> 06:16.080
So if you don't want to support Prime, I'm not suggesting alternatives.

06:16.080 --> 06:20.480
You can hate watch on the seven seas, so to speak.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.280
You're her fidgety.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.560
Nothing is evil in the beginning.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.160
This is how Google began.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.160
Nothing's evil in the beginning.

06:29.160 --> 06:33.160
But even then, there was light.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.160
You mean our Mary Sue?

06:36.160 --> 06:41.160
Even you could have possibly believed there was a scrapbook float.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.040
It's not going to float.

06:43.040 --> 06:46.760
I hate how the elves are just people.

06:46.760 --> 06:47.760
Are these elves?

06:47.760 --> 06:48.760
Wait, I can't even tell.

06:48.760 --> 06:51.020
They've got like regular ears.

06:51.020 --> 06:52.020
You show them.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.020
They're slightly pointy.

06:53.020 --> 06:55.020
Like, look, they're slightly pointy.

06:55.020 --> 06:56.020
Yeah, she's an elf.

06:56.020 --> 06:57.020
Yeah, I guess.

06:57.020 --> 06:58.020
Oh, my God.

06:58.020 --> 06:59.020
It's a little fucking spawn.

06:59.020 --> 07:00.020
Whee!

07:00.020 --> 07:02.240
Oh, it's a magic origami.

07:02.240 --> 07:05.080
Galadriel made a magic spawn.

07:05.080 --> 07:09.520
Oh, evil toxic masculinity.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.800
Toxic fucking white boy males at it again.

07:12.800 --> 07:17.400
Wow, this story is already really bad.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.080
These are elves.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.160
They look like people.

07:20.160 --> 07:22.400
They speak like people.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.400
Like humans.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.400
What the fuck?

07:24.400 --> 07:28.100
Yeah, the ears aren't pointed enough, you know?

07:28.100 --> 07:30.480
It's the way they shoot it, too.

07:30.480 --> 07:32.800
The way they did it in the movies was actually brilliant.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.320
It gave them an in the luminescence.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.600
Yeah, they kind of glowed.

07:36.600 --> 07:42.320
You know, at this point, I think I preferred the three long pointed ears, like a foot long.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.520
You see those in Warcraft's highlighters?

07:44.520 --> 07:46.840
This guy's barely got pointed ears at all.

07:46.840 --> 07:49.100
Also, they should not be talking about darkness.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.360
This is the first age.

07:50.360 --> 07:53.280
They don't even know darkness exists yet.

07:53.280 --> 07:58.560
Ah, that's that's her brother, isn't it, Finrod?

07:58.560 --> 07:59.560
If I had to guess, yes.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.880
But you must learn to discern them for yourself.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.560
I won't always be here to speak them to you.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.360
Oh, no.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.080
Come along.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.080
Foreshadowing much?

08:11.080 --> 08:13.280
God, this is really bad.

08:13.280 --> 08:16.000
Death flags abound.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.080
We have two death flags on them already.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.920
Nice and subtle.

08:22.920 --> 08:28.500
The symbolism of him walking away over the horizon and she not following and her crying.

08:28.500 --> 08:31.280
And she's talking about death.

08:31.280 --> 08:36.880
Oh my God, Story, can you stop?

08:36.880 --> 08:40.440
The two whatchama doozies, I forget their names.

08:40.440 --> 08:41.440
The Elden Ringtrees.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.880
Oh, doing a bit of a time skip, I see.

08:44.880 --> 08:45.880
Just a bit.

08:45.880 --> 08:46.880
Oh, my Jesus.

08:46.880 --> 08:47.880
OK.

08:47.880 --> 08:48.880
Yeah, we.

08:48.880 --> 08:49.880
All right.

08:49.880 --> 08:52.960
We're skipping to this part, fair enough.

08:52.960 --> 08:56.280
How many how many years have we skipped now?

08:56.280 --> 08:57.280
Quite.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.400
I think a thousand, maybe over now.

08:59.920 --> 09:07.920
They're now basically pursuing Morgoth to recover the light of Valinor, a place known

09:07.920 --> 09:10.080
as Middle Earth.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.080
Oh, my God.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.080
I clapped.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.080
I clapped when I saw it.

09:14.080 --> 09:17.040
Oh, God, I hate this shot.

09:17.040 --> 09:20.000
You see, this helmet symbolizes dead soldiers.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.720
Don't worry, it's not just that helmet.

09:23.720 --> 09:28.000
Yeah, here we go.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.720
That's good stuff right there.

09:29.720 --> 09:36.720
So what I shot, we did is collect all the helmets of the elves died.

09:36.720 --> 09:42.920
It is the most unelven thing ever to just pile up those helmets of dead elven soldiers.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.440
Hey, have you guys heard that orcs are black coated?

09:45.440 --> 09:47.440
I don't know what you're talking about, Dev.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.040
I don't want to get cancelled.

09:49.040 --> 09:55.200
Oh, my God, we time skipped to his death even.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.080
So how many years now?

09:57.080 --> 09:58.080
How many years?

09:58.080 --> 10:02.800
Honestly, we're in the thousands, and that's kind of all I know.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.680
I think we're out of the first agent of the second now, aren't we?

10:05.680 --> 10:07.360
Yeah, we're in the second age now.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.600
So we skipped over the entire first stage.

10:10.600 --> 10:11.600
That's good.

10:11.600 --> 10:16.920
Because remember, Lord of the Rings takes place during the third age.

10:16.920 --> 10:20.880
He became a girlboss.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.040
Gaslight Gatekeep Girlboss.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.040
Yes.

10:24.040 --> 10:28.480
Galadriel is personally chasing us.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.960
I assume she didn't originally do this, did she?

10:31.960 --> 10:33.100
No.

10:33.100 --> 10:38.800
Is it just me or is their voices really soft with the music overpowering?

10:38.800 --> 10:40.520
That's been TV and movies for the past decade.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.400
Look at how strong she is.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.160
She's way ahead of everybody.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.560
Of course, they're holding her back.

10:47.560 --> 10:55.960
This was the show I was demonstrating.

10:55.960 --> 11:01.400
Oh, the fuck boy is keeping the girlboss down?

11:01.400 --> 11:03.600
He'll be wrong enough to apologize.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.600
Or die.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.200
She doesn't care about her men, though.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.200
Jesus Christ.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.440
Considering that I did just watch Fellowship, there was that scene where they were on the

11:10.440 --> 11:13.200
mountain, and they were like, we have to turn back.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.200
And then they did.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.200
Galadriel is far stronger than I.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.200
That's abandoned.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.200
She's gonna abandon her own men.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.200
Feels like how empowered she is.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.200
She's like, no, we keep moving.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.200
Oh, no.

11:25.200 --> 11:36.680
My fucking bad command has gotten one of these elves, like, fucking badly injured.

11:36.680 --> 11:37.680
But there it is.

11:37.680 --> 11:41.400
She was right all along.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.240
It's just Elsa's palace.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.280
I hate these elves.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.280
They're not elves.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.280
They're not token elves, at least.

11:52.280 --> 11:56.280
Galadriel just punched through an ice wolf the best.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.280
Well, hold on.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.080
I don't fully know this lore.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.280
Do the elves have super strength like some elves do in this?

12:02.280 --> 12:06.280
They are stronger than mortal men, if I remember right.

12:06.280 --> 12:07.280
Faster.

12:07.280 --> 12:12.680
But not, not punching through a solid wall of ice with their fucking hands in two blows

12:13.120 --> 12:15.120
Probably not that.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.120
Her girl energy makes that possible.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.120
Girl energy?

12:19.120 --> 12:21.120
See, we're in the second age now.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.120
It's second wave elven feminism.

12:25.120 --> 12:28.120
Don't worry, she's super smart and knows everything.

12:28.120 --> 12:31.120
She's a special snowflake, in fact.

12:33.120 --> 12:37.120
That's not how he works, but details.

12:37.120 --> 12:41.120
According to Amazon, actually, it is.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.560
According to Jeff Bezos.

12:43.560 --> 12:49.560
Actually, Jeff Bezos said this isn't his fault.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.560
The show.

12:50.560 --> 12:51.560
Wait, what?

12:51.560 --> 12:52.560
Yeah.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.560
Apologize.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.560
He apologized before the show started.

12:55.560 --> 12:56.560
No way.

12:56.560 --> 12:57.560
Yeah.

12:57.560 --> 12:59.560
I'm sorry, guys.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.560
That's hilarious of Joe.

13:01.560 --> 13:02.560
Jeez.

13:02.560 --> 13:08.560
Literally, what Lou had pointed out, the men are only holding her back.

13:08.560 --> 13:10.560
They're constantly questioning.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
There's something here.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
He wasn't here.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Can we go home and he's a bitch?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
I'm right.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
He's always gotta be right.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
As we'll probably see throughout the entire thing.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
She's always right.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
I mean, she's already flawless.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
What has she done wrong?

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
Even when she was a kid, she was perfect, but the children were holding her back.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
The white males were holding her back, really.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
She...

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Oh, shit.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
You know, these guys aren't acting like elves, by the way.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
Bumbling around an ancient ruin like a bunch of muppets.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.440
That's because she has to save them.

13:42.440 --> 13:45.440
In a lot of stories, elves are just like humans with pointed ears.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.440
Maybe they have more magic, maybe they're stronger.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.440
Like Vulcans, basically, sometimes.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.440
Or like in Warcraft, they're just like other people.

13:51.440 --> 13:56.440
But in Lord of the Rings, aren't they supposed to be like almost godlike?

13:56.440 --> 13:57.440
Fine.

13:57.440 --> 14:00.440
Now, fastly superior to humans.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.440
Yeah.

14:01.440 --> 14:07.440
And the easy thing about you is an actual scene of a fucking human.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.440
I love how right I was.

14:09.880 --> 14:10.880
Christ.

14:10.880 --> 14:11.880
She...

14:11.880 --> 14:15.880
They couldn't do anything to it, but only she could.

14:15.880 --> 14:16.880
Yep.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.880
She's the only confident one of the bunch.

14:18.880 --> 14:19.880
Also, I thought...

14:19.880 --> 14:21.880
I think she's such a bitch.

14:21.880 --> 14:22.880
Uh-oh.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.880
The fuckboy's gonna say something.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.880
Gotta hold the girlboss down.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.880
All these white men holding her back.

14:28.880 --> 14:30.880
Fucking white people, am I right?

14:30.880 --> 14:32.880
Are you...

14:32.880 --> 14:36.880
Are you literally, like, laying down your arms?

14:37.320 --> 14:39.320
No, serious...

14:39.320 --> 14:40.320
Oh, that's...

14:40.320 --> 14:41.320
Ah, fuck me.

14:41.320 --> 14:46.320
They laid down their arms before her feet like a bunch of fucking retard.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.320
Right, so we're off to a horrific start.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.320
Oh, god, is it the retarded people?

14:53.320 --> 14:54.320
Yes, it is.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.320
Yes, it is.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.320
Why do they have those?

14:56.320 --> 14:58.320
Like the wind would blow them over.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.320
Yes, it would.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.320
I love the antler people.

15:01.320 --> 15:02.320
Look at that.

15:02.320 --> 15:03.320
What is that?

15:03.320 --> 15:05.320
They just have giant antlers on their back.

15:05.760 --> 15:07.760
Okay, so this was shown off early on.

15:07.760 --> 15:10.760
Yeah, so these are like hunters, but they wear giant antlers for some reason.

15:10.760 --> 15:11.760
And they just look retarded.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.760
And they were like, look at the new Lord of the Rings.

15:13.760 --> 15:15.760
And this is like the first picture they showed.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.760
And these people, they just look so fucking stupid.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.760
This is the early second age, they're talking about barstools?

15:21.760 --> 15:23.760
These should be fucking neolithic savages.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.760
I have to guess.

15:25.760 --> 15:29.760
I would say they're like wearing the antlers to appear bigger to animals.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.760
See, that's not wrong.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.760
But like, that would scare away predators.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.200
But you'd have a hard time hunting like that.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.200
Oh god, we have the harfoots.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.200
Oh no.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.200
Don't worry, we have a black one too.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.200
Don't ask me how.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.200
So what are these guys?

15:44.200 --> 15:46.200
Are these guys just like Kokiri or something?

15:46.200 --> 15:47.200
Like primitive poppets.

15:47.200 --> 15:52.200
Yes, but Amazon can't call them hobbits because they don't have the rights to the hobbits.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.200
Wait, they actually don't?

15:53.200 --> 15:54.200
Really?

15:54.200 --> 15:55.200
Nope.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.200
They don't.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.200
That's why these are harfoots.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.200
These aren't canon.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.200
Wait, hold on.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.200
Hold on.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.200
It's pseudo.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.200
Wait a second.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.200
Explain this to me.

16:03.640 --> 16:04.640
They've got access to the...

16:04.640 --> 16:05.640
Oh god, what's the English word?

16:05.640 --> 16:06.640
You know, the list of things that's in the book.

16:06.640 --> 16:07.640
But they don't have anything to do with the actual Lord of the Rings books.

16:07.640 --> 16:08.640
They've got like the summaries and stuff.

16:08.640 --> 16:09.640
Oh, but not the actual main stories.

16:09.640 --> 16:10.640
Okay.

16:10.640 --> 16:11.640
No.

16:11.640 --> 16:12.640
Which means that they don't actually own hobbit hobbits,

16:12.640 --> 16:13.640
and so these aren't hobbits.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.640
These are harfoots.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.640
And that's why they've specifically said, Lenny Henry here in fact specifically said,

16:15.640 --> 16:16.640
that the harfoots weren't hobbits.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.640
Now, that's bullshit according to the lore, but...

16:17.640 --> 16:18.640
I don't know.

16:18.640 --> 16:19.640
I don't know.

16:19.640 --> 16:20.640
I don't know.

16:20.640 --> 16:21.640
I don't know.

16:21.640 --> 16:22.640
I don't know.

16:22.640 --> 16:23.640
I don't know.

16:23.640 --> 16:24.640
I don't know.

16:24.640 --> 16:25.640
I don't know.

16:25.640 --> 16:26.640
Like, Shunkus.

16:26.640 --> 16:27.640
You guys were all thinking it.

16:27.640 --> 16:28.640
Yep.

16:28.640 --> 16:29.640
A little bit.

16:29.640 --> 16:42.000
Look at the way they're shooting this.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.920
They're shooting from down and up all the time.

16:44.920 --> 16:49.140
The hobbits don't look like hobbits, they look like, again, just fucking people.

16:49.140 --> 16:55.360
Yeah, so I recall seeing a making of the original Lord of the Rings way back in the day.

16:55.360 --> 17:00.400
showed like all the camera angle tricks to make um to make elijah wood look so much smaller than

17:00.400 --> 17:05.280
everyone else right yeah they built the cart with like the seat in the back and like all that stuff

17:05.280 --> 17:10.160
they really made them look like they were tiny people and this i don't get that feeling from

17:10.160 --> 17:18.240
this at all why do you got leaves in your hair because they're quirky their culture it's their

17:18.240 --> 17:26.320
culture basically it's a a very lazy way to make them look oh they're like either finicky

17:26.320 --> 17:33.040
so i'm guessing they're like tree ground uh hobbits i'm guessing well the thing is

17:33.840 --> 17:40.000
in the show they're described as no uh nomadic people that travel with the growing seasons

17:40.880 --> 17:45.680
for all the sense that makes and they're supposed to be super stealthy so i'm assuming that's why

17:45.920 --> 17:53.760
they've got branches in their hair oh that's their camo not wolf ah fuck me

17:55.520 --> 17:59.200
i heard you're just gonna have an aneurysm watching this the thing is i'm not even the

17:59.200 --> 18:06.080
biggest like lord of the rings lore fanboy person but it's just basic shit like this pisses me off

18:06.080 --> 18:13.280
because they know this isn't a wolf and yet they call it a wolf anyways all wrong quote unquote

18:13.360 --> 18:21.520
it doesn't look like l running mr anderson ah they're doing they're already sabotaging

18:21.520 --> 18:26.480
his character how's that nice you know you notice that notice how he's already making errors and

18:26.480 --> 18:33.040
scratching out words he's unrefined not thinking clearly his guidance from a strong female

18:33.040 --> 18:39.600
character i mean i think aileron is already like a thousand years old but details details

18:39.600 --> 18:51.920
the writers don't know that

18:53.520 --> 18:58.160
wait this is the exact same as house of the dragon it's the same story where like the girl

18:58.160 --> 19:02.720
the girl boss flies off in the dragon and gets the job done and comes back and the king is mad

19:02.720 --> 19:08.080
that she did it all on her own but doesn't get recognized for her work yeah it's the same fucking

19:08.080 --> 19:13.520
story it's it's the classic strong female character she's the only one who knows

19:13.520 --> 19:20.880
and ever nobody believes her everybody else are morons she's gotta be proven right yeah everybody's

19:20.880 --> 19:27.120
gonna be like oh you're right oh you know that story isn't necessarily bad john snow did that

19:27.120 --> 19:30.480
was pretty well done with him and the white walkers it was well done in mass effect when

19:30.480 --> 19:35.360
no one believed shepherd about the reapers but like yeah there are other stories you can do with

19:35.360 --> 19:40.320
girl characters you know anime is full of stories you can do with girl characters there are but this

19:40.320 --> 19:47.120
is the only strong female character hollywood knows like this is is their strong female character

19:47.120 --> 19:52.160
sadly it's sadly true for a lot of mainstream writers and that's why we see it regurgitated

19:52.160 --> 19:56.480
in multiple shows because they they're creatively bankrupt and they don't know how to write female

19:56.480 --> 19:58.800
characters she's adventurous by the way

20:05.840 --> 20:12.320
look she's female frodo oh my jesus she is well isn't this more isn't this more female

20:12.320 --> 20:16.640
bilbo because frodo frodo was kind of reluctant to go on the journey actually yeah that's actually

20:16.640 --> 20:21.200
more apt because bilbo was the one who had that wanderer's lust but was like holding himself back

20:21.200 --> 20:26.400
and then finally gave in yeah frodo i mean i just watched fellowship the ring frodo he was more like

20:27.040 --> 20:32.080
he did it because he was a good person he knew it had to be done but he didn't really want to

20:33.360 --> 20:37.440
he was a reluctant hero but he understood that uh gandalf couldn't take the ring and that he

20:37.440 --> 20:48.480
had to take it he was the ring bearer somehow i feel like you know adriel might have an objection

20:49.040 --> 20:56.960
soon look at how mad she is yes jesus christ she's just fucking glaring

20:59.680 --> 21:02.800
it's a ceremony for her you can at least be nice for the second right

21:03.920 --> 21:10.000
wait i thought the whole point of this story was that everyone was going going to valinor yeah

21:10.800 --> 21:16.480
no no the elves pursued across the sea and that's why they founded various elven kingdoms like

21:16.560 --> 21:21.920
linden where they're right now because they were hunting the uh the things that were stolen by

21:21.920 --> 21:28.480
oh fuck i can't remember but all elves have a calling to go back to valinor right you know i

21:28.480 --> 21:36.240
will say like it it looks good a lot of the scene compositions are are the production i don't know

21:36.240 --> 21:42.320
about the scene composition but like the production value is okay my annoyance is in the the lack of

21:42.320 --> 21:49.360
the representation of these are not people i feel a bit too human yeah yep they're a bit stiff

21:50.880 --> 22:00.240
like those wooden carvings oh god damn it but like galadriel is basically just ray

22:01.040 --> 22:05.920
from from the star wars sequels that's fairly accurate i'd say just in different clothing

22:06.720 --> 22:12.800
every female protagonist has to be ray no don't and uh if you have objecthood

22:12.800 --> 22:19.840
you're a bigot and you hate strong empowered women obviously it is over the evil is gone

22:23.200 --> 22:28.960
oh my god literally my feelings that's a you problem lady ah yes my lived experiences

22:29.440 --> 22:36.960
what she ironically just pulled that well the problem too is galadriel has not

22:37.680 --> 22:44.160
seen galadriel was not with the army galadriel has not fought sauron my friend

22:47.120 --> 22:49.760
damn friend zone but the other way around

22:50.240 --> 22:52.560
hahaha

23:00.240 --> 23:05.280
i mean at least the map's done nicely that looks pretty nice but that's about it i want to run my

23:05.280 --> 23:14.480
hand through it i'll bet it feels nice get your greasy paws off me map that's so textury it looks

23:14.480 --> 23:27.040
very textory that's true i'm sorry kibs you racist you look at a black woman is this the

23:27.040 --> 23:33.360
person to laughter i'm sorry but like when it comes to cultural you have this like european town

23:34.000 --> 23:40.320
and then there's just a random black lady and she has like the black head scarf and and like the

23:41.040 --> 23:43.040
like the circles hanging that's like an african thing

23:44.640 --> 23:47.840
we just got random diversity scattered everywhere

23:49.600 --> 23:55.120
and the worst part it feels like a quota doesn't it oh speaking of diversity hires we got a new

23:55.120 --> 24:03.600
character it's a black elf so is he supposed to be some kind of dark elf or is it literally just

24:03.600 --> 24:15.520
a black elf okay yep they're all fair-skinned also like i think they've made have fucked up

24:15.520 --> 24:21.520
because they mentioned this is the south lands i mean this should be the lands of like

24:22.320 --> 24:26.640
let it go i didn't see where the map was painting

24:28.800 --> 24:32.560
now still honestly because uh this doesn't look like thinking

24:33.440 --> 24:39.280
by the way racism is bad in case you were unaware racism is indeed bad

24:40.000 --> 24:45.840
unless it's against elves thank you amazon prime for showing us i hate his hair most of all like

24:45.840 --> 24:51.120
sure okay so he's black or portrait hold on look at his breastplate though what about it

24:51.120 --> 24:57.680
it's made of wood or something it's made of plastic those are the finest costumes at spirit

24:57.680 --> 25:05.280
halloween okay his hair is the thing that annoys me the most because okay he's like it's the

25:05.280 --> 25:09.600
current year they've got to have black elbows because reasons but at least they could have

25:09.600 --> 25:17.440
given him long flowing hair instead like he is the most anti-elf you can imagine like in in tone in

25:17.440 --> 25:23.520
demeaner in appearance because elves are supposed to have long beautiful hair give him long dread

25:23.520 --> 25:31.280
locks that's not beautiful we got an interracial relationship now yep kib called it kib genius

25:32.640 --> 25:38.640
but another short-haired elf they all seem to be short-haired now pretty much really

25:40.400 --> 25:47.200
the elves are talking about their life we gotta have vulgarity you know again they're just

25:47.200 --> 25:52.240
people that's the thing they're just fucking people with people's concerns

25:54.480 --> 26:00.400
they're just humans they're not even elves my point is that's a cool shot only twice

26:00.400 --> 26:06.960
in known he waited till now to speak his point after like three hours of walking

26:08.800 --> 26:13.440
listen you just wait for three hours you know my point is actually

26:14.400 --> 26:18.480
it's like what what the fuck were you talking about maybe they're just elves from a different

26:18.480 --> 26:27.120
region idk that region's called amazon land of amazon basil's high king

26:29.440 --> 26:35.680
do you notice also every time they pronounce a name or a place name they change their

26:35.680 --> 26:41.600
pronunciation drastically not only they can just talk always talk like that that's the problem

26:42.160 --> 26:47.920
most of the time they speak like just regular fucking humans and then when they occasionally

26:47.920 --> 26:54.240
inadvertently have to say something that's related to lord of the rings their pronunciation changes

26:55.200 --> 26:59.920
to be fair arch you're barely speaking like a human right now damn he's more elf than these

26:59.920 --> 27:07.360
characters she's got the hots for that black elf though look at her he knows

27:07.600 --> 27:12.640
you know why are you at my home or make

27:16.400 --> 27:17.600
oh jesus

27:21.840 --> 27:28.960
that's fucking racist all right time for the the action to brew up fellas here we go

27:29.200 --> 27:30.800
where are you going dramatic music

27:33.200 --> 27:37.360
so obviously the cow's been grazing in corrupted lands

27:39.840 --> 27:44.000
corrupted lands they're unaware of you know do they do any reconnaissance whenever we're

27:44.000 --> 27:50.080
garrisoned here they just sort of chilled in their little fort and that just waited

27:50.080 --> 27:54.400
yeah weren't they there for like 79 years or something they weren't patrolling around

27:54.400 --> 28:02.640
attention they're just sitting there twiddling their thumbs it's a lie maybe that's why he's

28:02.640 --> 28:08.960
a half no i'm sorry child then what happened to him his dad is the elf though you think so

28:08.960 --> 28:14.160
this is the real bouncy that's why he's light brown that's racist kibbs race is a social

28:14.160 --> 28:22.640
construct oh that's the evil looking sword he's got the sign sorry just stand there at attention

28:25.360 --> 28:28.160
mean to be fair it's the most elven thing they've done so far

28:28.720 --> 28:32.640
we wait in full armor what happens if you fall off the boat

28:37.360 --> 28:39.920
very descriptive thank you strange how

28:42.320 --> 28:50.080
on my way is there a tin can look like it like in the background i'm pretty sure that was a tin

28:50.160 --> 28:52.480
can in the background there better than a starbucks cup

28:58.000 --> 29:00.080
you're the only one who let me hit it

29:02.240 --> 29:05.360
listen he's desperate okay well the warden's fucked up a bit

29:09.440 --> 29:12.560
maybe you should have warned the garrison instead of your girlfriend

29:13.440 --> 29:17.760
still standing there they've been standing there for fucking days

29:21.040 --> 29:27.920
no one can take the sword from you no one's doing anything on the ship they're just standing see the

29:27.920 --> 29:34.880
writers think that overs overly ceremonious will be very elven delicate i mean again to be fair

29:34.880 --> 29:39.360
this is the most elven they've been so far yeah but even when they get on the ships to valinor

29:39.360 --> 29:47.200
and the other movies like they don't wear their full battle garb no no but give them a point for

29:47.200 --> 29:55.600
trying i don't give them a point for being amazon barge listen i like my knife i want to stab

29:55.600 --> 30:02.720
somebody with it now this is actually a pro second amendment message never give up your arms damn

30:02.720 --> 30:12.960
oh my god valinor is an arwelian nightmare so how does luminor work like uh like valinor

30:12.960 --> 30:18.560
yeah that's i mean it's our valinor it's like the land of the see i'm not super familiar but

30:18.560 --> 30:23.280
i've been starting to read up on the lore a lot more but basically it's like a magical land where

30:23.280 --> 30:27.920
nothing dies and so that's why the immortals like elves that go there you know that's where

30:27.920 --> 30:33.120
they belong they don't belong in middle earth i see it's the land of the valor the valor

30:34.160 --> 30:38.080
so can just anybody sail there or do only elves though how to

30:38.560 --> 30:44.480
uh only else mortals can exist in the land works there's sometimes rare exceptions but that's why

30:44.480 --> 30:50.560
there's the van then alcom frodo was able to go there they made an exception for him because he

30:50.560 --> 30:55.120
did and you know that was only because he was going to die anyways like he would die in valinor

30:55.760 --> 30:59.600
it's a mercy because mortals aren't allowed to valinor because they apparently like it's sort

30:59.600 --> 31:05.680
of alluded that they age too quickly but immortals are fine there it's also because it's nice to have

31:05.680 --> 31:12.560
the ethnostates i think they brought all the ring bears so they brought frodo sam and bilbo

31:14.320 --> 31:18.160
yep because like you guys are in it you can you can come on

31:20.560 --> 31:26.400
you can join our ethno state you're your exception you guys are honorary ways you can come in

31:26.400 --> 31:37.920
nice to follow yeah i reckon i can swim to shore from here i'll just jump out

31:39.520 --> 31:44.400
like she literally did no way she's gonna swim all the way back home

31:49.120 --> 31:52.720
do you understand writers how far she's gonna have to swim now

31:53.360 --> 31:59.920
isn't like a thousand miles like she'll never make it of the atlantic ocean she'll never make

31:59.920 --> 32:04.640
it because the currents would pull her away even if she swam as hard as she could that's fucking

32:04.640 --> 32:13.040
horseshit she doesn't even have like a trifle to hold on to yeah she's basically dead so uh gg

32:14.160 --> 32:21.360
you're dead dead if you do that the natural reaction to anyone seeing a meteorite crash

32:21.360 --> 32:26.080
nearby wandered towards the burning wreckage especially if you're like a you know primitive

32:26.080 --> 32:33.200
civilization you're not terrified or anything also what's in here what well first the meteorite

32:33.200 --> 32:41.440
wouldn't look like this but i guess it's a person crying in the show that's how she's crying too

32:41.440 --> 32:47.760
everybody's they have water in their eyes wait wait wait that that is sauron that is sauron

32:48.720 --> 32:54.560
oh my episode two is up already what yeah yeah yeah so uh they did like an episode one and an

32:54.560 --> 33:05.760
episode two in one day you gotta keep going kibs let's spend a few minutes talking about what the

33:05.760 --> 33:13.600
fuck we just watched oh god because we watch okay here here's what a pilot's supposed to do right

33:13.600 --> 33:18.400
introduce your characters introduce your setting introduce at least get the conflict started this

33:18.400 --> 33:21.680
shouldn't be the first time you're exposed to what lord of the rings is it feels like because

33:22.320 --> 33:30.480
this pilot relies on so much past knowledge of everything that's come before the only reason

33:30.480 --> 33:37.600
that we care about any of this is because of the previous movies they didn't establish anything

33:37.600 --> 33:45.600
that makes us care in this dev you're you're being facetious okay they introduced her brother for at

33:45.600 --> 33:55.200
least five seconds and then he died hold on they introduced him he maybe had like two minutes or

33:55.200 --> 34:00.640
five minutes of screen time before he died and they foreshadow his death in the introduction

34:00.640 --> 34:06.000
to his characters like this story is so rushed like we should have gotten a whole like thing

34:06.000 --> 34:10.320
about the the war of wrath rather than just like the war of wrath happened and it was bad

34:10.320 --> 34:17.760
i was like okay but but yes so what what what happened in gladiator story she she went through

34:17.760 --> 34:23.520
the ice she found evidence of sauron nobody believed her she went back she was being sent

34:23.520 --> 34:28.480
away she refused and jumped into the ocean like that that's the tldr of it right but

34:29.200 --> 34:34.480
yeah so sauron's returning and things are getting corrupted and all things are bad

34:35.120 --> 34:40.880
yes so so the other stories actually had stuff kind of happening in them but it really seems

34:40.880 --> 34:47.200
up something but like it's kind of setting up something but it doesn't make you care about

34:47.200 --> 34:51.760
any of the characters beyond this is these are people that you already know from previous movies

34:52.720 --> 34:58.080
because they're doing the same thing because the the completely new characters they're so bland

34:58.080 --> 35:04.320
it's it's the same problem with house of dragons like you are expected to know

35:05.200 --> 35:09.840
the reason why you should give a shit like you should care about galadriel because it's

35:09.840 --> 35:18.480
galadriel it's given you no other reason to give a shit we also established um oh god elrond but

35:18.480 --> 35:23.440
we also established i can't remember the guy's name let's call him black elf or belle for short

35:23.440 --> 35:29.840
and we also established yeah belle and uh harfoot lady so we have three story arcs that have been

35:29.840 --> 35:34.480
prepped so i somehow they're gonna all intermingle i think the harfoot one's gonna have something to

35:34.480 --> 35:40.400
do with the sauron dude yeah i have a sneaking suspicion they're all gonna be kept completely

35:40.400 --> 35:44.640
separate and i have another sneaking suspicion that they might actually be taking place at

35:44.640 --> 35:50.560
vastly different times oh so that would be really weird well they did that with the witcher and it

35:50.560 --> 35:54.240
was fine with the witcher with all the different time periods kind of shifting around fine and

35:54.240 --> 36:00.080
fine it was it was a decent show the witcher i like the witcher come on you guys are being

36:00.080 --> 36:05.760
apologetic just because henry kevl was in it that's it i've established it to be fair the

36:05.760 --> 36:12.400
arrival of sauron is a pretty big deal and but he's not obvious he's the stranger this is part

36:12.400 --> 36:18.000
of his ploy yep he's pretending he's gonna be he's gonna blend in with the rest of everyone

36:18.000 --> 36:21.840
because he's gonna eventually slip his way to numenor and trick the numenorians into

36:22.400 --> 36:26.720
trying to break the ban because they'll be like the elves are you know they're they're preventing

36:26.720 --> 36:30.720
from going to valor because they're they're holding all their power and immortality and

36:30.720 --> 36:36.880
he's like what really that's they're dicks i want the immortality they're why can't we have it arch

36:36.880 --> 36:41.280
i know you and i disagree on house of the dragon like you think it's bad i think it's like okay

36:41.280 --> 36:46.000
it's not amazing but it's okay i'm gonna beat you we're gonna beat you i feel like house of the

36:46.000 --> 36:51.600
dragon actually set up its principal characters to have personalities way more than this because

36:51.600 --> 36:57.920
we know that in that show the king is kind of weak and and he doesn't have a grasp on anything

36:57.920 --> 37:02.640
we know that that the daughter is is is intelligent but overlooked we know that

37:02.640 --> 37:07.760
her uncle he he's the evil uncle who wants the throne like they set up the characters

37:07.760 --> 37:12.640
well enough that we can tell who they are based on personality i don't think this show did that

37:13.280 --> 37:18.640
they all just seem to be the same bland person i feel like this show is kind of the same though

37:18.640 --> 37:24.000
because this show is also and then and then and then and the house of dragon is and then and

37:24.000 --> 37:29.120
then and then it tells us rather than really showing us and when it shows us it's overt

37:29.120 --> 37:32.960
it's like look his fingers falling off look he knocked over a statue and broke it

37:32.960 --> 37:39.840
seeing his house is coming undone foreshadowing it's a little too on the nose that's the thing

37:40.560 --> 37:45.040
dev is actually correct here in that house of dragons has done more like it's

37:45.040 --> 37:51.360
it's basic bitch shit the king is literally rotting to demonstrate that his realm is falling

37:51.360 --> 37:56.960
apart the uh the princess is the only capable individual that can get anything done and her

37:56.960 --> 38:05.760
uncle is like yes yes yes yes yes but at least those are characters galadriel's only character

38:05.760 --> 38:11.360
here she is it was actually a brilliant uh comparison she is ray she is the cardboard box

38:11.360 --> 38:16.640
that speaks she is strong female character and the other characters they they don't even exist

38:16.640 --> 38:22.160
like elrond what we knew about elrond well he writes okay cool uh what about gilgalad well he

38:22.160 --> 38:28.240
has like leaves that are made of gold uh he's a king and he's wrong actually that's what we know

38:28.880 --> 38:33.360
the show hasn't even really told us about his position like what is he king of is this an

38:33.360 --> 38:39.520
important title like is he respected well we kind of know he's king of linden because he's

38:39.520 --> 38:44.880
in linden that's the thing you know he's king of linden well you'd assume he's king and he's also

38:44.880 --> 38:51.280
in linden ads are but what's linden a normal person what's linden is that the entirety like

38:51.280 --> 38:56.320
is that all of it they show you on the map what linden is it's next to ariador but the thing is

38:56.320 --> 38:59.600
what they don't really show you is like the borders or anything like that yeah exactly and

38:59.600 --> 39:05.200
what's ariador yeah it's like i mean the map has only panned past ariador it's never actually done

39:05.200 --> 39:10.640
anything there it's just a thing on the map for the newcomer ariador means nothing and we also

39:10.640 --> 39:16.720
introduced them to complete the other else i don't dare like okay who's he why why is he in the

39:16.720 --> 39:24.640
southlands the southlands as well that is one hell of a skip and a jump and also they keep present

39:24.640 --> 39:30.640
they're presenting the southlands as if they were like major allies to morgoth like they would

39:30.640 --> 39:37.280
barely have counted in morgoth scheme like that was not a war of men like that was a war in which

39:37.280 --> 39:43.360
balrogs were generals the if i remember right they were more like a vassal state fighting alongside

39:43.360 --> 39:49.600
his forces but that's about it so for the elves to like set up a garrison there to police their

39:49.600 --> 39:55.120
conquered subjects i don't really remember that being a thing because i i think like the only

39:55.120 --> 39:58.720
time they're relevant again from what i know is when the numerians start you know setting

39:58.720 --> 40:03.680
colonies and building up stuff over there and they've got a full site the worst part is too

40:03.680 --> 40:10.000
i'm actually kind of annoyed they're white they should be brown yeah because we're in the south

40:10.000 --> 40:16.160
lands these are the people of ruin right so it should be kind of like southerly like a little

40:16.160 --> 40:23.520
bit arabic kind of yeah a mix of arab and mongol a little bit more instead they're just they come

40:23.520 --> 40:29.920
across as like just european peasants yeah because yeah you're right so like european so i i don't

40:29.920 --> 40:35.840
know the lore the way that that that archon kibbs does but i do know that there are certain places

40:35.840 --> 40:42.640
where certain human races come from in lord of the rings and every population shouldn't just be

40:42.640 --> 40:48.160
mixed race my impression of like southlands weren't they like the people on the boats that

40:48.160 --> 40:53.600
showed up like uh at the third movie they have returned to the king they have like big elephants

40:53.600 --> 41:04.800
hey yes those guys um actually those are different oh god because those i i know the name but i can't

41:04.800 --> 41:09.600
bring it up because this is from the horadrim right yeah horadrim because this is actually to

41:09.600 --> 41:15.920
the east the southlands is past the lands of mordor so this should not look like a european

41:15.920 --> 41:21.280
village which is it's interesting isn't it like they've got a force in a black elf but in a

41:21.280 --> 41:27.920
position where they could actually have a diverse village like now illy law europe the corsairs were

41:27.920 --> 41:32.480
coming up the river or the direction where the river leads to goes to os giliath os giliath is

41:32.480 --> 41:37.520
the former capital of gondor ministeroth is actually a uh like city fortress kind of thing

41:38.000 --> 41:41.600
the that's the thing that the corsairs are actually white because they're full of

41:41.600 --> 41:47.360
numerians oh yeah they are i forgot about that they're the black numerians right

41:48.400 --> 41:53.280
yes also the black numerians aren't actually black by the way this is they call them black

41:53.280 --> 42:03.200
because they turned evil that's racist i'm sorry but i'm not i don't dare and bronwyn

42:03.200 --> 42:08.320
like their romance is not explained it's just like they they meet you see them by the well

42:08.320 --> 42:13.360
and they're like i'd like to have sex with you i know but i can't see this is just modern writing

42:13.360 --> 42:17.840
because it's the forced interracial relationship that does that comes out of nowhere in left field

42:18.640 --> 42:24.560
it's not natural there's no buildup for it i mean galadriel got a prequel okay well introduce the

42:24.560 --> 42:29.040
other characters then at the very least i don't they're like arriving you know looking around

42:29.040 --> 42:35.520
uh being called a black person for a while then he goes like i think you're cute even though you're

42:35.520 --> 42:41.040
black something like something to establish a relationship but they're kind of forcing it along

42:41.040 --> 42:47.520
the show is rushing he said like you're the only kind touch i felt okay like there's i'm saying

42:47.520 --> 42:54.320
i'm sensing that there's like an implied history between them but it's like we're not we're not

42:54.320 --> 43:00.480
shown nor was it told well maybe maybe they'll show it to us that's we want to give him the

43:00.480 --> 43:06.000
benefit of the doubt and maybe they'll get a flashback back yeah but that's gonna flashbacks

43:06.000 --> 43:11.600
work sometimes for twists but this is kind of on the nose because i swear to god that kid that is

43:11.600 --> 43:17.360
his kid you think so oh because his ears are being dead left yep his dad also left because of that too

43:17.360 --> 43:22.240
remember and and his ears are all hidden by his hair you think it's gonna be i think i think the

43:22.240 --> 43:25.760
elf dude's dad originally is gonna hate him and he's like i don't like you but they'd be like

43:25.760 --> 43:28.960
actually you're my dad and you know what we're pretty cool actually and then they shake hands

43:29.760 --> 43:37.280
he's also found the sword of sauron which is god damn it don't worry about it that's just

43:37.280 --> 43:45.280
lying under the floor that's true most of sauron's artifacts kind of have a corrupting influence

43:45.920 --> 43:50.720
well i mean it did kind of glow and look at him a bit that's true everybody's gonna turn evil

43:51.360 --> 43:59.440
he's still fine this is the thing um well what they established in the uh original movie trilogy

43:59.440 --> 44:05.920
boromir is tempted by the ring by just being near it he's willing to kill his compatriots

44:05.920 --> 44:11.520
to her normal human touching an artifact of sauron should be a pretty fucking big deal

44:12.400 --> 44:18.720
yep remember the council when they were in uh oh god uh the thing with the e basically

44:18.720 --> 44:23.680
elrond's uh fortress city place and they were all fighting and bickering because the rings

44:23.680 --> 44:32.480
influence is that powerful yeah yes i'm letting like the different magnitude again like the racist

44:32.480 --> 44:38.480
boy look at the stories i was like oh i want it um but it's like the him holding it there's it

44:38.480 --> 44:43.680
doesn't even look like it's having much of an effect on him yeah you think that he'd be like

44:43.680 --> 44:49.120
instantly possessed or something or at least get like mind fucked should we start the second

44:49.120 --> 44:58.160
episode are you ready to go yep might as well oh god here we go the last the evil is gone then why

44:58.160 --> 45:08.000

45:17.280 --> 45:22.080
yeah it's nicer than what twitter said it was yeah no that's not i thought it would be like

45:22.080 --> 45:29.280
them fading in like that thing yeah where did that come from then maybe it was a trailer a fan edit

45:30.080 --> 45:36.560

45:36.560 --> 45:42.640

46:33.760 --> 46:37.360
also not to mention there hasn't been a handsome elf in the show yet

46:40.640 --> 46:41.520

46:45.120 --> 46:50.400

46:51.520 --> 47:01.040

47:30.960 --> 47:36.560
and like a female sam they're even repeating some of their goddamn dialogue what's the old saying

47:36.560 --> 47:42.960

48:38.800 --> 48:40.480
my good erection

48:56.080 --> 49:00.000
at least they're establishing the reason why he's going to be talked into making the rings

49:07.920 --> 49:12.960
hot as a dragon's tongue and as pure as starlight the things we could use it to create could

49:12.960 --> 49:20.320
transform middle earth nothing bad could ever be created from such a thing don't worry about it

49:21.360 --> 49:27.360
have you considered seeking partners outside the confines of our own race feel far outside

49:30.080 --> 49:35.120

running across the plains anymore it's like uh it's like a loading screen it's like a little

49:48.320 --> 49:55.200
picture all right yes calin broad one of the richest and most powerful influential individuals

49:55.200 --> 50:02.880
in the entirety of elvenham walks to kazakhdum he's a simple man he wouldn't go on a cart with

50:02.880 --> 50:09.440
a bunch of soldiers no luxuries no creature comforts it just not even backpacks how the

50:09.440 --> 50:14.400
fuck did they eat wasn't there that special elf bread that keeps you fed yeah but how the fuck

50:14.400 --> 50:22.640
much of it will it be carried beyond what you want it is elrond of lindon accompanied by calabrimbor

50:22.640 --> 50:32.640
lord of oregano and no one else no all right okay i admit that was kind of funny

50:33.200 --> 50:41.360
the dwarves are base now trust me is he gonna walk back again yep a few days all right go ahead and

50:41.360 --> 50:48.160
walk back by the way all sorts out by myself i don't know why i brought you motherfucking what

50:49.440 --> 50:59.040
so he came all the way out that's actually really like how many weeks must have taken

51:00.000 --> 51:02.160
well he's walking back by himself

51:04.960 --> 51:08.560
being the doors at their height is pretty cool yeah

51:10.640 --> 51:17.680
are all the females beardless so what yeah this is a inconsistency like oh my god

51:19.760 --> 51:25.440
isn't the tokens female dwarves like they're supposed to have like full beers yeah

51:29.440 --> 51:34.160
they didn't have the stones motherfuck yeah they didn't have the stones to do it like the

51:34.160 --> 51:38.640
witcher did i appreciated that which we saw the bearded dwarves they were female that was cool

51:38.640 --> 51:43.280
problem is you've already established that he's going to get the workforce

51:48.880 --> 51:52.480
yeah that's just the big problem with the prequels you already know what's going to happen right

51:53.280 --> 51:57.200
yep oh black dwarfs good fantastic light

51:59.520 --> 52:04.800
well you know what in warcraft they have the dark iron dwarves that are they're dark skinned

52:04.800 --> 52:10.800
yeah they're literally evil yes they're actually an evil race like personally i disagree now but

52:10.800 --> 52:16.320
if you want to say that all black people are evil then this is a hill you can die on dev you're

52:16.320 --> 52:25.120
welcome to it looks like a comfy spot right here dev uh hello we're back to the fucking hobbits

52:25.120 --> 52:31.840
not hobbits you mean the store brand hobbit he's being holy

52:38.080 --> 52:41.600
it turns out this is actually skyrim hold on i know what's gonna happen

52:42.560 --> 52:48.880
it's gonna be her credit that the ring didn't affect uh frodo or something oh

52:50.160 --> 52:56.880
she's gonna give sauron just enough love that the ring will have some kind of spell on it

52:56.880 --> 53:02.080
that doesn't affect hobbits in the same way they're french right eat the snail

53:04.240 --> 53:10.960
eat the bugs guys which animal finds the shell is it a snail or is it a crab because a crab

53:10.960 --> 53:16.400
that finds the shell right and the snails grow their shells the uh hermit crab finds their

53:17.120 --> 53:20.640
shell um snails they're just like um they grow them

53:23.520 --> 53:29.120
he's out of mana guys he can't cast anymore my god i hate the hobbit parts

53:31.280 --> 53:38.800
they're pretty bad aren't they i like i like angry hobos are on the can you migrate

53:41.840 --> 53:50.720
any migrants they're migrants arch i also want to point out here nomads do not grow crops

53:51.600 --> 53:58.560

53:59.360 --> 54:04.320
holy shit she's just giving her just gonna be her swimming for like 30 minutes

54:04.960 --> 54:10.880
oh this is fantastic though and ironically i love the fact that she's just gonna swim home

54:12.800 --> 54:18.880
well we were complaining before that the elves just seemed like humans maybe this is maybe

54:18.880 --> 54:24.000
this is how they make her seem like an actual elf they let her swim home absolutely i mean

54:24.000 --> 54:31.680
no human would do this see beast shark in each year don't forget she's got to be a strong

54:31.680 --> 54:34.160
independent women that's gonna be about

54:37.760 --> 54:45.760
the horns or something or a shipwreck out here maybe they're the numerians

54:47.840 --> 54:49.920
sailing west i don't know

54:52.320 --> 54:54.560
that's a very convenient piece of wreckage

54:54.560 --> 55:02.960
only the women's are the good guys only the women let her on jesus man she is flat as a pancake

55:04.320 --> 55:07.920
oh my god what a waste of water i need you to tell her all our affairs why not

55:08.800 --> 55:12.320
does she doesn't matter looks can be yeah like unironically why not

55:13.040 --> 55:15.120
like you're all gonna die dude come on yeah

55:15.120 --> 55:25.040
and this is such a pointless thing like they're worried like yeah we can't bring her aboard

55:25.040 --> 55:31.600
you're at the you're floating wreckage in the middle of god knows what wait until we can see

55:31.600 --> 55:39.280
the sails corsairs probably these waters do you want to be skinned alive corsairs who's fucking

55:39.280 --> 55:46.240
corsairs nice come back and pick you up is it gonna be a ghost ship as a hound no it's being

55:46.240 --> 56:00.880
warm yep okay trailer shot yeah okay that would have destroyed this raft that would have no it's

56:00.880 --> 56:06.320
it's still sturdy down oh my god can you believe the racism about these humans

56:09.520 --> 56:16.320
i don't know what i'll do oh she's gonna kill a thing yep name so they're all fuck because

56:16.320 --> 56:22.240
they're it's okay they're racist they deserve it there's another raft because why not

56:23.600 --> 56:27.760
now he attached his part he planned all of this beforehand you see

56:32.320 --> 56:34.400
he's like all right i need to get laid come on board

56:35.200 --> 56:41.360
um hello there offices mattress i'm the captain i feel like this is some sort of mini game

56:42.880 --> 56:47.440
oh yeah this is when you just tap a a whole bunch to like gain your strength

56:49.120 --> 56:54.640
this is the most engaging part of the story so far i think this is the most character moment

56:54.640 --> 57:01.040
we've ever had in this show you know i kind of like it though it's something it's something

57:01.280 --> 57:06.560
true he's weak-willed i can see the comedy god help me

57:09.120 --> 57:10.480
what is that abomination

57:12.720 --> 57:24.640
where's the beard told you to to stay out of my head the sargon heads it's a bit of a cameo

57:24.640 --> 57:28.080
you know i would have asked sargon to show up but i think it's too late for him might be almost

57:28.080 --> 57:32.720
early now well he has to like get up and go to work and he has a wife and kids too so

57:32.720 --> 57:34.480
us neats don't have to worry about that

57:40.400 --> 57:48.800
so there are no black doors in the lore are there no no i'll say this so far this is the best part

57:48.800 --> 57:56.720
of the show at least they're lively they've got personalities yeah i like doors so far and plus

57:56.800 --> 58:03.280
they don't look like people they look like dwarves but if only she had a beard i would

58:03.280 --> 58:10.880
actually be happy with this scene yeah reacting skills are actually pretty good i like her as a

58:10.880 --> 58:17.040
character yeah you know even though she was the face of so many so many derisions towards the

58:17.040 --> 58:22.160
show she's actually a pretty enjoyable character yeah i'm not gonna lie surprised the thing is the

58:22.160 --> 58:28.560
problem is she's an enjoyable character but she's still a middle finger to the very idea of tolky

58:28.560 --> 58:34.480
all they would have to do is paste a fucking fake beard on her and she'd be a great character like

58:34.480 --> 58:40.880
that is insult in and of itself also y'all put her in white face yes are we good too

58:40.880 --> 58:43.600
is

58:46.480 --> 58:51.600
wait what is she pulling on here i'm not sure what she's doing

58:58.880 --> 59:04.800
the acting director was like look like you're doing semen things so she's like okay i have

59:04.800 --> 59:11.840
no idea what i'm doing it's just a stick that's what she's talking on it's just a stick

59:11.840 --> 59:16.320
it's just a stick it's just a stick i don't know what she plans to do with it

59:19.440 --> 59:25.600
dame better hope that uh it's just a snake like look at that shot she's just talking

59:26.240 --> 59:33.200
fucking stick yeah listen what else you're gonna do on that boat a raft she's trying to she looked

59:33.200 --> 59:40.160
dizzy in a shot okay so that's what matters we've got a running montage my god oh never mind it's

59:40.160 --> 59:47.920
over evil things are happening

59:50.960 --> 59:58.240
hey you kind of match the music stone good job thank you hold on you didn't run to the garrison

59:58.240 --> 01:00:04.960
you run to the bar yep all right unarmed peasants it's the only set they have

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:13.920
how do you know that we must spread the word no i will not have this gossip runwin i've seen

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:20.560
landslides less dangerous than a wayward tongue without proof oh god it's galadriel all over again

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:26.320
she knows the truth and the men won't listen we've done this story before show this story

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.400
they really like using the same

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:49.280
that's a bloody big mice you know when i first saw this tunnel like

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:55.040
in the previous scene for some reason i was thinking um fire ants from fallout

01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:00.000
getting around down there yeah actually i heard a rumor that making a fallout show

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.040
yeah that's gonna suck the set leaked oh god and it's set in new jersey at least it's mostly

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:12.080
destroyed already i mean it's in a wasteland i'm pretty sure elves are supposed to have

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.800
pretty good night vision so why is he giving away his position by carrying a fucking lantern

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:22.320
in the dark ass tunnel okay

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:30.880
yeah just keep swimming my dude i'm i'm sure this uh comes up somewhere yeah swim

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:36.240
into an underwater oh jesus christ oh that was lucky ah this is the jump scare scene

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:42.960
is there a jump scare scene there's jane behind him

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:54.400
oh jesus that was so painfully obvious too now she's running home bitch garrison well to be fair

01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:01.440
like that is where her son is yeah but but but she didn't go here first though either you go

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:08.960
to get your kid or you go to get the soldiers you wouldn't go to the bar first yes yeah she

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.400
went into the bars only to be told oh you're a woman you don't know what you're talking about

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:22.160
you're wrong she's tried that already she fucked up she went to the wrong group damn

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:28.640
he was like oh you're gonna hide in the closet okay but she has no idea what's in the hole

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:33.120
like she'd be safer running we need to have a scary scene though where she's scared in the closet

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:42.640
do we do we really that sound right now that sound is the creaking of their rubber suits

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.960
oh my god lol

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:53.120
here it comes yep i think he called it very soon

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:01.120
oh it's a soft dress oh no

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:13.120
that is a remarkably uh

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:20.400
oh jesus okay so this is getting a bit

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.000
it's just like they're not

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:35.600
it's just that they're not a superhuman uh actually apparently they are according to the amazon

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.920
oh excuse me boy i'm entailed by a fucking metal sword so you know

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.320
oh strong independent woman

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:56.640
why first light i was right there damn strong female wait wait hold on hold on hold on

01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:02.160
jesus christ this is loud in that scene there was light coming in through the windows in the

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:08.640
bar wouldn't you just go now no damn the town's about to go no we gotta wait till the last second

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:14.720
we need to get that attention why did they give the goblins a chance to attack them yeah it's not

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.200
fair dev some of the characters need to die off so they can you know get rid of them gotta make the

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:24.960
stakes seem high so it's just very clear why like she went to the bar first it's so she can have

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.320
that i told you so a little bit yeah yes that was the only reason

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:38.000
oh

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:54.400
yeah and she's just gone here she goes she's like sinking like a rock now she's tangled

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.160
yeah good job that's a very good idea woman

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:06.160
alla branda says like should i shave her i mean she didn't have sex with me so maybe she's not

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:11.600
worth it yeah she kind of she was a little bit but she might have a bit of a prude but yeah that's

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:17.360
right she's right though she might because she did say bind see he misinterpreted it

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:27.920
you could just haul up the rope fucker oh cop in a feel i see you'll have to sleep with me now

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:34.640
i'm gonna take her sword yeah just mind you dagger actually listen he's awake again

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:38.240
she passed out a second ago but i guess all about fresh air mister revitalized her

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.760
oh yeah yeah the fresh air underwater

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.120
find yourself to me this time

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:51.120
oh my god so she was like unconscious underwater and he had to be helped in the end

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:58.960
they probably rewrote the scene because like oh it's we can't have the men being strong

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:06.800
erases it this is just the hippie commune it's a lantern we use fireflies

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.000
that's a lot of fireflies in there

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:16.000
oh my god he's whispering to like gandalf i clapped when i saw it

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:35.840
how did you get to that conclusion the writers needed us to okay damn the bugs died they all

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:46.400
just fucking died are dead but the ones inside her lantern are okay yeah yeah magic protected

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:52.240
them i guess how many fireflies you got to collect to put in there that's like a several day project

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:57.360
well that sucks for them i guess digging to the bell rock

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:58.340
okay

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.880
oh it's the arkenstone

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:16.240
are you gonna clap when you see it kibs remember it's dipper dipper not gonna show it though they're

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:22.000
too much of a no they didn't show it they didn't have that copyright either they're trying so hard

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.800
with the member berries it's not even funny do is behaving remarkably calmly for a person with

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:33.840
an orc hole in his house they just moved a table over it it's fun it reacts to his blood interesting

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:40.080
also did it draw the rolling back or something oh it is yeah reconstructing itself

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:44.800
yeah there's definitely something wonky going on with this guy

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.800
he's a guest mother i will command the old legion soon what

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:56.880
i'm calling it numen orient i better be right or barges getting beaten

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.000
nah this is the end of the episode that's what this is

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:13.760
okay so i'd sum that up as a lot happened and nothing happened kibs stop it

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:21.120
i can't i'm too lazy he's like how can you be this crazy do i hear noises

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:29.840
no it's your imagination yeah the trailer is playing for some reason why is it playing how

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:34.240
is it even whatever if i click this button and then pause it and then it will shut up

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:44.320
all right yes so episode two we one and two two punch double feature uh-huh that was two

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:52.160
hours of my life and i do not feel particularly enriched yeah i kind of i kind of like i don't

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:59.920
feel anything really i feel apathy actually about the whole show honestly see like it wasn't

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:06.080
a so bad it's good kind of thing you know it was just kind of you know i don't want to be

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:15.040
too mean to it i i'm i there was parts of it i liked i'm mildly entertained but yeah like

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:20.480
the village setting was so boring yeah like when the galadriel was like nah i'm a swim home

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:29.280
yeah that was like that was pretty good hey at least it went as horribly as you'd expect except

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:34.080
for you know randomly stumbling brilliant ideas after brilliant ideas this episode like tying

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:41.200
herself oh fuck she's like she's been a fuck up this whole time even as the show is trying to

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:46.240
tell us that she's implacable and infallible yeah i tried to make her feel like oh she's so smart

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:51.520
she knows she's she's right all along is this like and she just it feels like she's just been

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:59.040
handed the idiot ball tie yourself to the sinking rack jump into the unending ocean

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:07.920
bind yourself to me strong women sinks the symbolism there pull on the stick on on your raft

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:16.080
thing the only thing i've enjoyed so far are the dwarves like everything else interesting

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:22.080
i like the dwarven city that was like underground and stuff i thought i thought that was cool

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:26.480
a little bit of effort actually went into it as well like the images there

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:35.360
they had the adorvan like like uh agriculture and like the waterfalls is showing them how how

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:40.720
they get food down there it's just like how they live they're showing how they bring light down

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:46.960
yeah that's interesting but what is this like just wish we'd seen more of that and we've seen

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:53.600
more of that everywhere with like the elven setting and like the human setting even like

01:10:53.600 --> 01:11:02.480
the human setting doesn't have to be just boring european-esque village it's just but it is but it

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:08.480
is yep yeah everyone's choreography is probably the strongest in this entire show and the rest

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:15.440
are just kind of wet farts okay that's the problem with the timing here so this is very

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:21.280
early for the humans and you see those original hunters and they look very savage like wearing

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:26.960
retarded hordes for some reason and yet their civilization is actually pretty fucking advanced

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:31.840
like they've got tons of stone structures they're living in settled villages they've got livestock

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.600
like it's not terribly far off because remember the the humans that helped the elves were gifted

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:40.960
that thing barch numenor and so they're on their little island of numenor and this is like their

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:46.560
golden age but it's also coming to an end because everything's about to go south well that's another

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:51.440
thing too humans and numenoreans are not the same thing either like the numenoreans are superior

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:58.640
species wow do you hear this oh my god i mean they lived for 200 years i think that qualifies

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:08.720
well hold on arch are they white yes but yes but by now their their lifespans are beginning

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:12.960
to shrink and that's where the jealousy is going to kick in they're starting to forget about the

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:18.480
whole everything about the ban on balanor and everything else they become arrogant and decadent

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:22.160
and i think that's what the show is going to probably show what do you what do you all think

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:30.560
of hobo sauron he feels like he he isn't there for any reason other than they were like where we

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:38.240
can't have hobbits somehow but how do we make them relevant i know sauron so the hobbits help sauron

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:46.480
so you're sorry the harfoot i did the harp like i called it like i am i am seriously calling it

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:51.760
like they're gonna do something and they're gonna like help in some way sauron to life

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:56.400
it's gonna all be thanks to nori that frody was able to frodo was able to carry the ring

01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:01.680
it was actually nori the real hero that's what's gonna be sauron's master plan for rebuilding the

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:06.240
world was actually like yes i'll help the hobbits because they were my loyal allies and then frodo

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:14.160
fucking throws the ring and there's like god why i trusted you oh god what if it turns out

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:19.760
yeah let's put the most retarded possible theories okay it's gonna turn out that she

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:26.880
that she dies and then reincarnates as frodo he kind of looks a little bit like

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:33.440
so actually frodo was had the spirit of a girl the whole time

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.560
all right just gonna continue doing this as more episodes come out

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:42.640
if you want to we can keep doing it every week but jesus this is painful to watch

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:48.480
well at least next week it'll be uh only an hour only an hour instead of because there'll be one

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:55.200
episode right yeah about an hour long uh this was quite a time dedication but i don't mind

01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:01.680
like watching anything is like no matter how bad as long as we're watching with like people it can

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:08.160
be fun yeah how long is this season because we we haven't even seen isoldo or elendil or

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:14.480
eight episodes it's eight episodes in i believe it's eight episodes so six left okay so we're

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:20.480
we're a fourth in we haven't even met half of the main characters listen arch they're gonna milk

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:29.360
this for five god damn seasons five seasons they're gonna try to drag their heels oh my god

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:36.480
amazon lord of the rings a hundred years amazon is warty lord of the rings amazon bought the

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:42.880
television rights for lord of the rings for 250 million dollars in 2017 and then set up a five

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:49.360
season production worth at least one billion dollars this is the most expensive tv series

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:54.800
ever made jesus christ you know what it feels like it feels like a big web meh like there's

01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:01.040
a lot of production budget stuff in here but by and large my my overall feeling is like like

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:08.320
it fine again it's it's the lack of soul like what they're making here is it's it's a lot of

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:14.160
the rings we're told but what except actually the dwarves the dwarves are the only thing that

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:19.680
i've looked at so far and gone yeah lord of the rings everything else is just people in costumes

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:29.920
pretending yeah the elves are just like slightly arrogant like people with pointy ears yeah and

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:35.600
their original ears are even all that pointy there there's no magic here like there's no

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:44.240
lord of the rings there's no wonder there's no creativity and i die the elves again gill

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:49.760
fucking galad is supposed to be one of the mightiest individuals on the side of good like

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:56.080
he's a fucking warrior king and he's just some fucking dude like only noticeable because he's

01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:04.160
probably the only elf with semi-long hair yeah he's just he's just like important elf guy and

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:09.200
that's about it wait what what if it what if it what if you know how the elves live for thousands

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:16.560
of years right what if it just turns out that elven hair grows so slowly that they just can't

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:22.000
grow long hair yet a lot of the younger ones yep it's gonna take him another 100 years another

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:28.000
thousand years ago gladriel have long hair like galadriel has long hair as a child that's true

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.040
oh dev you've been defeated oh yes well hold on hold on as a child though she's an elf she could

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:39.680
have been like 60 in that who knows i've been wrecked never hold on hold on hold on does that

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:46.560
mean that the loli the loli at the start of the show is legal no dev no that's not

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:56.960
oh and thus the end of the series began yeah it it feels like we're just kind of spinning our

01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:02.880
wheels here you know like two two hours into a show you should you should have more stuff going

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:08.160
on than this in my opinion something should be happening so far the most dramatic thing that's

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:13.920
happening is that there are probably goblins and they're probably gonna attack some village of

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:19.920
humans in the middle of fucking nowhere of no relevance to anyone yeah why are we supposed

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:28.080
to care about this village uh because uh dude with the sauron sword there you go yeah i guess

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:34.000
it's the only thing i can think of of you three which of you actually watched the kenobi show

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:39.600
we all did i have you all did okay yeah and and you know that i made my big

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:46.080
giant essay my two and a half hour long video on kenobi okay um i hope you watched it it took me

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:51.280
like three weeks to make it but and all all you listening out there too you better watch it too

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:59.200
but i do want to point out um one thing i noticed with kenobi is that if you cut all the fat out of

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:05.600
it it's like an okay story it's not great because and that's why i mentioned in that video that

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:10.400
there's a guy who took all the all the footage cut it into a two and a half hour movie and it

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:18.640
was fine and the more that i watch new tv i'm realizing like for some reason all these new

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:25.120
shows they just move so slowly and i think they're trying to mistake moving slow for being epic or

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:30.400
they're making that mistake rather and it's like you know sometimes like i i get it like you have

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:35.440
a huge story in a massive world and you want to really take it in but you can't just do nothing

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:41.200
you know you you the problem is too there is superfluous characters like out on there and

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:49.680
bronwyn i don't fucking care halbrand who the fuck is that halford's what it's like we can cut

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:57.040
a lot of these characters just right out i have a feeling that after this season is over someone's

01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:02.160
gonna cut this into a movie like kenobi and it'll probably be like an okay lord of the rings film

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:07.680
not gonna be great but it'll be okay if they were just focusing on elrond so far i would have been

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:13.040
like okay that was all right like elrond's character he uh he is not elrond like he he

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:20.560
cannot follow up agent smith he just kind of brim bore too is just again all of these characters

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:26.320
are deeply flawed because they're just fucking people like there's nothing elven about them

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:33.280
i don't really never feel feel the majesty as much as when when like um witnessing the elves

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:38.800
as they were portrayed in the movies this has none of the mad juice there's there's no like

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:45.520
yeah there's no like glow or like ethereal aspect about them they're just like well also

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:52.240
what helped is that aside from legolas you didn't see much of them they were there for a few scenes

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:56.320
and they would like flow around they would like kind of glide around the place and that would

01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:00.080
be about it because if you see too much of them you realize that they are just people

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:04.640
there's also the style in which it is shot like the lord of the rings movies are very

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:13.600
warm kind of a little bright almost they're very magical and inviting they're in color whereas

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:18.480
here you've got the classical fucking tv show where everything looks fucking cold and dark

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:26.320
and grim and realistic and yeah i guess that's just like the 2020 look yeah well it the 2020

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:33.680
look is like the inheritor of the 2008 fallout 3 brown and bloom look you know we're to make it

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:37.440
look more realistic they just make it look darker and it's like well sometimes you can make things

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:41.920
pretty bright and it looks pretty good sometimes you have to have the you know that spark of hope

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:51.120
looks cold and boring and sickly like this is the least majestic person imaginable just a

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:56.000
drenched house cat well to be fair she is swimming back home that's true

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:04.240
yes the entire length of the island i want to point out that none of that happened in

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:10.880
the original lore though like this is all well because that's stupid this is all a ridiculous

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:16.800
contrivance to have her in the middle of the ocean to meet halibran who's drifting

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:25.200
don't worry about it don't think about it as for what i think is good you know i i i'm also

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:30.240
enjoying the dwarf storyline they have character i like i like them uh them getting along with

01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:36.640
alrond um i don't mind the hobo sauron stuff i can see what they're going for and what they're

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:42.160
going for could actually be quite quite good they're just not doing it that well but like the

01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:48.160
the the the the bone of the story is is actually decent it's it's the galadriel stuff that just

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:54.880
seems to be a complete fucking train wreck the galadriel thing is a train wreck and black elf i

01:21:54.880 --> 01:22:02.720
just don't care about that's right i forgot about him i didn't even mention him the worst part is

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:10.560
right now he was in a hole he was in a hole yeah he's just he just fucked up yeah he's just gone

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:14.800
because the problem is this is actually only going to get worse because right now we have village in

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:20.960
the middle of bumfuck nowhere story arc we have elrond story arc we have galadriel story arc and

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:26.800
we're gonna get elendil story arc and isildur story arc and the queen lady as well like we're

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:35.520
only going to get more characters disparate spread across this huge universe i can only

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:42.880
hope that the converge at some point but like well it is a lot to keep track of all at once

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:47.280
i think everyone just wants to do game of thrones now you know yeah that was a big thing with a

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:51.040
billion characters like we can just do that just introduce a shit ton of people it's like well

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:54.480
game of thrones worked for a specific reason and it only kind of worked at the end

01:22:55.280 --> 01:23:00.800
yeah and it fails too i remember very vividly reading through the last like couple of game

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:05.200
of thrones books and thinking to myself god could you fuck off i want to get back to the characters

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:10.640
i care about yep oh bloat of characters just because you have lots of characters your story

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:17.440
doesn't inherently mean good care a good story or an epic for that matter well is that all we

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:25.360
have to say about this is this is this the end my final verdict is meh not worth a billion dollars

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:30.160
no not worth about jesus christ not worth a billion dollars um how about this considering

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:37.280
that uh you know august and early september seems to be just a torrent of shit is this as bad as

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:41.360
the other shows that have recently come out that are everyone's talking about right now oh god this

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:47.920
is nowhere near as bad as halo or as fucking kenobi like this is just mediocre or or is she

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:54.880
hulk she hulks a fucking nightmare jesus i dare not watch that oh no i i watched the first episode

01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:58.560
and i was like i can't i can't i can't fucking like naomi refused to watch it with me she was

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:03.520
like nope not the same well because her and i we sat down to watch the halo show because she was

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:08.320
like an xbox kid growing up so she said i want to watch halo so we watch it and it was like a fucking

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:14.720
there's a fucking holocaust watching that thing the i think it depends on the scale you're judging

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:21.680
it by because pablo schreiber the tv show was bad in that it wasn't about halo in the slightest it

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:28.960
was a story about pablo traveling the galaxy it was it was just a and kenobi was the same kenobi

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:34.240
has nothing to do with selves it is a just a big fat middle finger to the star wars universe where

01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:40.960
every character acts like a complete fucking retard like the organa's calling kenobi on his

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:47.280
phone like again and again i know you're in hiding and shit but he is in danger what is this thing

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:53.440
this thing is just bloat it is mud like i can't even judge it because i don't even know what's

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:58.880
fucking happening the character's stories have progressed not at all like galadriel's story is

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:03.600
the one that's progressed the most and the only thing that's happened there is she knows silence

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:08.400
alive nobody believes her and she jumped in the ocean like two hours later she's finally

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:14.560
being recovered from the ocean this whole show just feels like just sort of forgettable and i

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:18.160
think that's probably i think that makes it arguably worse than the other ones because

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:23.920
they're memorable because they're about there this show there's nothing really to talk about

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:29.840
like it's just kind of it's there it's it goes at the pace of a snail and it's not very good

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:33.040
do you know what it reminds me of you know what reminds me of it reminds me of the um the new

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:38.800
harry potter movies the wizarding world movies right um the um the fantastic beast they're

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:42.640
trying to make that into a series and no one really cares and i've seen a couple of them

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:46.720
and they're not bad movies they're just very forgettable movies no one's gonna no one's gonna

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:50.320
remember those in 20 years the way they'll remember harry potter like the originals and

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:55.040
that'll probably be the same with this in 20 years time no one will be right we'll be re-watching

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:59.600
this shit but they'll re-watch the original movies yeah people will remember the good stories

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:06.080
no one will remember these things like kenobi even halo they'll be forgotten yep and it has to

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:12.000
do with the lack of soul because you look at this and it tells you it's lord of the rings like the

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.080
characters have the names of the lord of the rings they even have the little stairs and shit but

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:22.480
there is nothing lord of the rings here like there is no magic majesty there's no mystery there's

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:28.800
nothing that makes you feel like this is a lord of the rings property beyond names and set pieces

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:33.440
i mean i i would i wouldn't i wouldn't use sargon's term the progressive skin suit for

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:37.520
this one i don't really see it fully but it's a skin suit of some type that's for sure i'll

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:44.160
give it this much like as in terms of actual story there hasn't been any obvious progressivism

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:51.120
beyond every female character being the only competent people in the room but yeah so that's

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:57.760
the current year and the diversity hires but again that's behind the scenes politics the show itself

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:05.600
hasn't got any like political views so far it doesn't i guess i noticed i didn't bring it up

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:11.680
but i noticed one but i it's only like half a political view you'll notice that like all of the

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:16.480
all the not hobbits they're all very isolationist and i was like are they are they are they going

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:22.320
to do that do a trump thing later about about yeah but the hobbits are the isolationists yeah

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.760
yeah but that's why i didn't bring it up because i was like maybe maybe not but there are hobbits

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.760
they're hobbits tm there's not hobbits

01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:40.240
