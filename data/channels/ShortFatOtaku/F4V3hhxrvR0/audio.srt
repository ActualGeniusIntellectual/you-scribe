1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,560
Gather around, kids. Today I'm going to explain to you some dumb internet nonsense,

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,520
something that you'll never need to know or learn about if you just log off, but is

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,560
nonetheless floating around the more deranged online spaces.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,160
This won't be on the test, any test. This is entirely useless information and will occupy

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,980
valuable brain space from now until the end of your existence. You have a large but finite

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,040
number of thoughts you're able to think before you die. And fair warning, you will

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,100
be wasting a few of those precious neurons on this topic if you keep watching.

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,900
So what is code switching? Otherwise known as code mixing or language alteration, code

9
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:49,120
switching began as a term used to describe the behavior of multilingual people when switching

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,260
between two different environments that also necessitated a switch in language, which carried

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,900
with it a switch in mode of thought.

12
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,940
The first time the term was ever used was in the 1951 anthropology book, Language of

13
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,980
the Sierra Muac, a study of the languages of California's native tribes. It was used

14
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,540
there to describe the common practice of those people in the modern era switching language

15
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,240
mid-sentence when talking amongst people who knew both languages. Sometimes these language

16
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,180
switches can become languages of their own, pulling from both parent languages and being

17
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,340
partially understandable by their parent speakers, like Afrikaans or Tagalog. Code switching

18
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,480
also refers to the practice of changing tone or dialect while changing language. A great

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,820
example of this personally is my old college roommate. He was from a pretty rich family

20
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,620
in Taiwan. When he spoke English with us, he was pretty down to earth, but when he spoke

21
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,520
Chinese to his parents on the phone, the words and tone of voice that he used made him sound

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,960
like a snobby rich kid.

23
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,320
But most commonly in the West, code switching is used to refer to the tendency among black

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Americans to switch between African-American vernacular English when in a casual setting

25
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,040
to a more formal and more white-sounding accent and word choice when in professional settings.

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,320
Of course, within progressive circles, this means that when white people code switch,

27
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,020
they're being racist. The first time this became a terminally online discourse cycle

28
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:15,000
was back in 2019, when AOC code switched between the voice that she commonly uses in interviews

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:42,080
and a very overemphasized Latin accent when saying Spanish words.

30
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,720
Liberals when a white person code switches. Dude, that is seriously racist, man. What

31
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,160
the fuck? Liberals when AOC code switches. Dude, that's totally okay. She can do it.

32
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
She's a Latina.

33
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,680
Innuendo Studios is someone with a huge amount of deep lore behind him that I'll have to

34
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,860
cover one day. Now's not the time. But he is a leftoid through and through. He said

35
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,400
in response to this whole thing, white people code switch all the time. They dial up and

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,000
down southern accents. Slang, vulgarity, working class dialects. Don't say code switching

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,760
when you mean to say, why is it okay for Latina to talk like a Latina, but not for

38
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,500
white folks to do it as a joke? Somebody replied to him with, he's pretty much just interpreting

39
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,920
code switching as deliberate racial parodies. That's going to spread like wildfire now,

40
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,800
isn't it? And he said, it's an extreme version of values neutral governance. If it's okay

41
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,420
for you to talk like a Latina, it should be okay for everyone to talk like a Latina.

42
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,400
This 2019 discourse was the first time I'd ever encountered the concept of code switching

43
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,440
and it was pretty interesting to me. So I decided to look into it. Innuendo Studios

44
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,840
is drawing a line between code switching and talking like a Latina. But if the rest

45
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,420
of this video is anything to go by, yeah, it literally is just talking like a Latina

46
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:52,520
in this case. Also, yes, of course anybody can talk like a Latina, you fucking segregationist.

47
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,120
Used in the terminally online culture warrior progressive kind of way, code switching refers

48
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,120
to jumping between two cultural spaces or communities and adopting different codes in

49
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,040
order to operate within them. These codes, they're kind of like masks that you can wear.

50
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,500
You're restricted by your demographics and adopting the wrong mask is cultural appropriation.

51
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,440
To use the AOC example, she's a racial minority. So if we follow progressive morality, she

52
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,180
can adopt the Latina code as part of that minority, but she can also adopt the white

53
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,080
code since she lives in a white dominated culture. And in order to access white institutions

54
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,380
and white spaces, she has to assimilate herself into whiteness. The more extreme racial activists

55
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,400
on the left consider this to be a capitulation to white supremacy and that these institutions

56
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:40,020
should be made explicitly non-white by privileging not only non-white people, but non-white codes.

57
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,940
This is why you often see stuff about how certain positive behaviors like hard work

58
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,400
or punctuality, they are white behaviors because they're white coded and therefore our society

59
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,700
views them as positive only because they're white. This renders all people who actually

60
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,400
perform these behaviors as white regardless of their actual race.

61
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,440
Do you believe that you have a different relationship with the social and political systems in society

62
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:07,660
based on who you are? You are a white, I'm assuming, I'm assuming middle-class Asian

63
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,660
American.

64
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,500
He must have misspoke, right?

65
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,120
White presenting, I should say.

66
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,940
You know what, dude? Mad props for the double down. Call him a fucking cracker, man. Fucking

67
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,580
go for it, dude.

68
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,580
I'm white presenting?

69
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,580
Wait, wait, wait.

70
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,580
What the what?

71
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,580
I can be white presenting Asian.

72
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,580
What the heck?

73
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,580
Let me rephrase that. Let me rephrase that.

74
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,580
Can you look at me right now? This is what, you know.

75
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,440
I can simplify that for you. I can simplify that for you if that upset you.

76
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,160
To be white now doesn't simply mean to have those genetics. It can also mean to be white

77
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,680
coded even if you're black.

78
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,520
If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump and you ain't black.

79
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,060
Which gets us into the codes themselves. Coding is progressive speak for describing

80
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,420
a person who adopts the qualities of a demographic without actually being a member of that demographic,

81
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,200
often with the implication that we should treat this person as if they are a member

82
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,580
of the demographic that they're coding themselves as, even if they aren't.

83
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,080
Of course, this concept fell flat on its face years before it was ever popularized with

84
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,580
popular transracial activists Shaun King and Rachel Dolezal. These people were laughed

85
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,700
at by the right wing and decried by the left wing as weird racists back during the internet

86
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,460
of five to seven years ago.

87
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,420
But in today's progressive terms, why wouldn't they just be black coded? Oh, I forgot because

88
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,340
whites can't code switch. That's racist. That British person who tried to transition

89
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,420
to being a Korean proved that.

90
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:42,460
Now coding doesn't have to refer only to behaviors but also to stereotypical features.

91
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,980
In other words, coding gives progressives a way to be racist. Appealing to stereotypes

92
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,440
before that was just racist. For example, you wouldn't say that this Arab woman has

93
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,980
dark skin and wavy black hair and other features that are common to her race, because if you

94
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,560
did that, you'd be racially profiling her, you bigot. But instead, you can simply describe

95
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,300
her features as racially coded and hey, problem solved.

96
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,060
This is just so ridiculous. In both cases, you'd be describing the physical features

97
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,420
that are common to a group of people. However, when you do it, you're stereotyping and you're

98
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,700
a racist. But when they do it, they're just describing features that are racially coded.

99
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,180
This conversation gets especially cancerous once we start talking about fictional characters.

100
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,480
Starfire is a common example. She's an alien with orange skin and wild untamed orange hair.

101
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,640
Black activists in the comic scene have been screaming for years that Starfire is black

102
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,380
coded, and that the more recent iterations of the character where her hair is straight

103
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,220
have been whitewashing a black character and therefore racist. Their argument relies almost

104
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,120
entirely on stereotypes of what black women should look like. An argument that would make

105
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,500
you a racist if you made it. Also, it's just factually wrong. As per her creator, Starfire

106
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:55,540
was based off of Iris Chacon, a Puerto Rican model from the 1970s, who had that exact red

107
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,520
hairstyle and orange California tan. Even some of the outfits she used in her photo

108
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,920
shoots were partially adopted as Starfire's superhero costume. But nonetheless, the progs

109
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,880
scream and cry about how racist it is if you deny that Starfire is black coded. You might

110
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,560
ask, why don't they just go for actual black characters that are commonly seen with Starfire,

111
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,660
like Cyborg and Bumblebee? They're both heroes, they're both positive black representation

112
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,960
for young black comic readers. Why would you fight over Starfire when there's already

113
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,120
actual black characters? The answer's obvious. Cyborg and Bumblebee's blackness is indisputable,

114
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,960
and therefore it's inconsequential. There's no argument to be had, no other interpretation

115
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,380
any reasonable person could come up with. There's nothing here to go viral, no hill

116
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:41,660
to die on, no virtue to signal. Nobody blinks an eye when you say that Cyborg is black coded,

117
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,260
because he's fucking black. But saying that Starfire is black coded? That's how you get

118
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:50,260
clicks on the internet. There are other non-human characters that progressives give the black

119
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,500
coded treatment to, but that conversation almost always plays out the exact same way.

120
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,460
So let's move on to queer coding. What's queer coding? Well, it's when a platonic heterosexual

121
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,580
friendship exists, and therefore gay people demand that they're gay. A great example

122
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,260
of this is Frodo and Sam from Lord of the Rings. Frodo and Sam aren't actually gay

123
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,360
in canon, they're simply good friends. But because their relationship is queer coded,

124
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,820
in the online LGBTQ community, in the gay canon, they're a couple. Authorial intent

125
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,580
doesn't matter, they will subvert and take away your spaces after all. The argument that

126
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,180
they commonly give for this is that in the past, to write about openly gay relationships

127
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,860
meant that you might get thrown in jail for obscenity. There's probably some truth to

128
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,920
that, that some characters would have been written to be more open about it had their

129
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,240
authors lived in a different time. Hell, even in the 90s, though they wouldn't have

130
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,240
been thrown in jail for it, on Deep Space Nine, Garak was censored from being bisexual

131
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,880
by the studio, which was the writer's original intent for that character. But for Frodo and

132
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,280
Sam? No. Tolkien was a devout Christian. Remember that whole thing with Spider-Gwen a couple

133
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,840
months ago, where people were transvestigating her as having large hands and wide shoulders,

134
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,620
and that haircut and the trans flag in her room meant that she had to be trans? It turns

135
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,480
out she wasn't. She was a cis woman, just a trans ally. But everyone's favorite stalker

136
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,320
brainlet, Quinton of Quinton Reviews, stated, even if she isn't canonically trans, I think

137
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,240
it's starting to seem pretty likely that her arc in the film was written as transcoded.

138
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,640
And I feel that's more important. This is the common lefty media analysis take nowadays.

139
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,640
What the actual story is doesn't matter. What the author originally intended can be

140
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,960
ignored. What matters is the coding. What politics can we overlay onto this media in

141
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,720
order to claim it as our cultural space? Here's the most cancerous one of all. Minor coding.

142
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,720
Yes, that is exactly how it sounds. When an of-age character has certain qualities that

143
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,680
are coded to be underage. Anime is full of these. Short, cute women in their late teens

144
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,600
or their 20s or even their 30s. Where, if you happen to mention that you like these

145
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,200
shows online, a ton of weird culture-warrior-obsessed progs will burst out of the woodwork to shriek

146
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,560
that you must be a pedophile. I remember when Elon Musk went viral for liking pictures of

147
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,900
Death Note's Misa Amane, a character who ranges between 19 and 24. And these Twitteroids

148
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,860
were out here saying, I'm sorry, but if you're like 50 years old, like in this,

149
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,580
you are a pedophile. Why? Not because of Misa's actual age, but because she's minor coded.

150
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,640
Here's another example that went viral when during this person's list of role-playing

151
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,920
tips for online RPs and tabletops and stuff like that, one of them was, don't lewd minor

152
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,340
coded characters. A minor coded character is a character who is considered an adult,

153
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,720
but exhibits so many child-like traits that it doesn't matter if they're an adult

154
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,940
or not, and thus they promote pedophilia and child porn. Typical traits of a minor

155
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:29,840
coded character include 1. A child-like appearance. The 1000-year-old dragon excuse, if you will.

156
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,340
2. Child-like hobbies. If they play with toys or exhibit other child-like traits, this is

157
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:41,160
a red flag. 3. Their height. Any girl under 5'7 is basically a red flag for being minor

158
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,160
coded, since that's the common height for children. Common height for children, jeez.

159
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,200
That's right, lads. If a girl character is under 5'7, she's minor coded, even

160
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,280
though the average height of a real-life woman is 5'4. This person got fucking destroyed

161
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,740
for this ridiculous take, the idea that adults acting childish promotes pedophilia. I guess

162
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,260
I promote pedophilia because I act childish every day. Uh, don't clip that. Again, like

163
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,600
the black-coded thing, there's tons of examples of this shit. They're easy enough to find

164
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,980
online, so let's move on. Now, Dev, you might ask, we're just talking about TV shows

165
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,140
and movies, who cares? Well, watch the Gramsci video already. But also, more importantly,

166
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,260
this doesn't stop at media. They actually treat real people like this. Cosplayers who

167
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,060
are of age, short, and flat-chested have been harassed for posting pictures of themselves

168
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:32,700
because their adult bodies apparently promote pedophilia. This person was demanded to provide

169
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,620
proof that they actually had small boobs so that they could be allowed to draw artwork

170
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,700
of their own characters who were also flat-chested. This person genuinely believes that the existence

171
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:47,140
of petite people promotes pedophilia. Here's a picture of an of-age Japanese model. Again,

172
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,500
flat chest. Apparently, according to progressives, if you find her attractive, you're a pedophile.

173
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,320
And finally, my friend V went viral with this take back during the ugly woman in video games

174
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,780
safe horny thing, posting not even a racy picture or anything, nothing underage, nothing

175
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,740
weird, just a random attractive woman's face. And this was called vaguely pedophilic. That's

176
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,820
right guys, if a woman is attractive at all, you're a pedophile now. Why? Because attraction

177
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,580
itself is obviously minor coded. Old people are ugly, young people are hot, therefore,

178
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,180
if you're attracted to any hot person ever, you're a pedophile. This sort of thing does

179
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,100
also happen to black people too, not just black characters, where if a black person

180
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,580
doesn't behave according to black stereotypes, they're white coded or they're whitewashed

181
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:31,340
or something. But I hate to say it, I guess I'm just kind of used to that level of retardation

182
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,820
at this point. I'm used to watching progressives shit on black people for not acting black.

183
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,700
I'm not used to the age thing though. And that brings us into the age gap discourse.

184
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,900
Have you ever noticed how progressives freak the fuck out whenever two of age people get

185
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,300
into a relationship if the age gap is too large for them? This conversation went viral

186
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,820
and boy it will make your head spin. I got called Jeffrey Epstein by a child because

187
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,180
I once dared to say that it's not grooming for a 21 year old to have sex with someone

188
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,880
in their thirties. Sorry to say, but the dude is kind of right. That age range is very much

189
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,080
a yellow light. Some are certainly mature enough to engage in sexual intercourse but

190
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,640
we have different standards. Pro tip, if you're in your thirties, don't fool with post miners.

191
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,920
Post miners now guys. That whole extended adolescence thing has gone a bit too far now,

192
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,960
hasn't it? You've heard of those pro-pedophile leftists? Well guess what? Meet the leftists

193
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,700
who are so anti-pedophile that they don't want younger adults fucking other adults.

194
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,600
People in their twenties are legal adults. If we can join the army, drink and take drugs,

195
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,820
pay taxes and have a job, then by god we can date people who are older. There is nothing

196
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,000
wrong with requiring a test in order to be licensed to engage in sex. My whole point

197
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,240
is that the post miner age range has tons of stunted development people, especially

198
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,660
neurodivergent people, and this protects them from older predators. So, while this is an

199
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,960
obviously retarded moral standard, it's still not even one that they hold themselves. Hey

200
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:57,780
all, I recently became the owner of a kid fur age regression chat room. It's for everyone

201
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:02,280
and anyone looking for a chill space to air your little or middle space feels. Marked

202
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,100
eighteen and up. If this guy believes that post miners, people who are over eighteen

203
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,860
but still relatively young, in their twenties, that they can't consent with older adults

204
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,380
in their thirties or more, why is he running a kink space for them? He is specifically

205
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,780
describing kinks that stunted development people have. This guy is violating his own

206
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,820
fucked up morality that normal people don't even adhere to. That's probably the most

207
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,740
retarded age gap discourse that I've seen. But it's not the only one. I've seen people

208
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,060
calling pedophile over thirty year olds dating twenty two year olds, forty five year olds

209
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,020
dating seventy nine year olds, Tom Cruise's age gap in the latest Mission Impossible sixty

210
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:40,100
one and forty one, and nineteen year olds dating twenty two year olds. Yes, for real.

211
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:45,220
All of these fucking people are totally cool with newly turned eighteen year olds immediately

212
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,460
spreading their asshole on only fans for less than the price of a fucking McDouble because

213
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,540
sex work is empowering, while at the same time morphing into Chris Hansen the minute

214
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,740
that a twenty three year old minor coded post minor woman identified uterus owner goes

215
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,620
on a date with a pedophilic twenty nine year old straight white male.

216
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,540
Anyway, that's the end of my saved up collection of cringe on codes and code switching. Most

217
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:10,140
of this stuff is people's natural puritanical tendencies bubbling back up and filtering

218
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,060
through the progressive repression. Basically, when someone is talking about codes, they're

219
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,580
trying to convince you of something that isn't, but looks like it is. That character is not

220
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,140
actually black. That woman is not actually underage. That person is not actually trans.

221
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,140
Those friends aren't actually gay, but they want society to treat those things as if they

222
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,460
were the case. Why? For some of them because it's good for their politics. For others

223
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,660
because it's good for their fetishes. And yet for others because they're fucking insane.
