0	10560	Gather around, kids. Today I'm going to explain to you some dumb internet nonsense,
10560	14520	something that you'll never need to know or learn about if you just log off, but is
14520	18560	nonetheless floating around the more deranged online spaces.
18560	23160	This won't be on the test, any test. This is entirely useless information and will occupy
23160	28980	valuable brain space from now until the end of your existence. You have a large but finite
28980	33040	number of thoughts you're able to think before you die. And fair warning, you will
33040	38100	be wasting a few of those precious neurons on this topic if you keep watching.
38100	43900	So what is code switching? Otherwise known as code mixing or language alteration, code
43900	49120	switching began as a term used to describe the behavior of multilingual people when switching
49120	54260	between two different environments that also necessitated a switch in language, which carried
54260	55900	with it a switch in mode of thought.
55900	60940	The first time the term was ever used was in the 1951 anthropology book, Language of
60940	65980	the Sierra Muac, a study of the languages of California's native tribes. It was used
65980	70540	there to describe the common practice of those people in the modern era switching language
70540	75240	mid-sentence when talking amongst people who knew both languages. Sometimes these language
75240	80180	switches can become languages of their own, pulling from both parent languages and being
80180	85340	partially understandable by their parent speakers, like Afrikaans or Tagalog. Code switching
85340	90480	also refers to the practice of changing tone or dialect while changing language. A great
90480	94820	example of this personally is my old college roommate. He was from a pretty rich family
94820	98620	in Taiwan. When he spoke English with us, he was pretty down to earth, but when he spoke
98620	103520	Chinese to his parents on the phone, the words and tone of voice that he used made him sound
103520	104960	like a snobby rich kid.
104960	109320	But most commonly in the West, code switching is used to refer to the tendency among black
109320	114320	Americans to switch between African-American vernacular English when in a casual setting
114320	120040	to a more formal and more white-sounding accent and word choice when in professional settings.
120040	124320	Of course, within progressive circles, this means that when white people code switch,
124320	129020	they're being racist. The first time this became a terminally online discourse cycle
129020	135000	was back in 2019, when AOC code switched between the voice that she commonly uses in interviews
135000	162080	and a very overemphasized Latin accent when saying Spanish words.
162080	165720	Liberals when a white person code switches. Dude, that is seriously racist, man. What
165720	170160	the fuck? Liberals when AOC code switches. Dude, that's totally okay. She can do it.
170160	171160	She's a Latina.
171160	175680	Innuendo Studios is someone with a huge amount of deep lore behind him that I'll have to
175680	179860	cover one day. Now's not the time. But he is a leftoid through and through. He said
179860	184400	in response to this whole thing, white people code switch all the time. They dial up and
184400	190000	down southern accents. Slang, vulgarity, working class dialects. Don't say code switching
190000	193760	when you mean to say, why is it okay for Latina to talk like a Latina, but not for
193760	198500	white folks to do it as a joke? Somebody replied to him with, he's pretty much just interpreting
198500	202920	code switching as deliberate racial parodies. That's going to spread like wildfire now,
202920	207800	isn't it? And he said, it's an extreme version of values neutral governance. If it's okay
207800	211420	for you to talk like a Latina, it should be okay for everyone to talk like a Latina.
211420	215400	This 2019 discourse was the first time I'd ever encountered the concept of code switching
215400	218440	and it was pretty interesting to me. So I decided to look into it. Innuendo Studios
218440	222840	is drawing a line between code switching and talking like a Latina. But if the rest
222840	226420	of this video is anything to go by, yeah, it literally is just talking like a Latina
226420	232520	in this case. Also, yes, of course anybody can talk like a Latina, you fucking segregationist.
232520	237120	Used in the terminally online culture warrior progressive kind of way, code switching refers
237120	242120	to jumping between two cultural spaces or communities and adopting different codes in
242120	246040	order to operate within them. These codes, they're kind of like masks that you can wear.
246040	250500	You're restricted by your demographics and adopting the wrong mask is cultural appropriation.
250500	255440	To use the AOC example, she's a racial minority. So if we follow progressive morality, she
255440	259180	can adopt the Latina code as part of that minority, but she can also adopt the white
259180	264080	code since she lives in a white dominated culture. And in order to access white institutions
264080	269380	and white spaces, she has to assimilate herself into whiteness. The more extreme racial activists
269380	273400	on the left consider this to be a capitulation to white supremacy and that these institutions
273400	280020	should be made explicitly non-white by privileging not only non-white people, but non-white codes.
280020	283940	This is why you often see stuff about how certain positive behaviors like hard work
283940	288400	or punctuality, they are white behaviors because they're white coded and therefore our society
288400	292700	views them as positive only because they're white. This renders all people who actually
292700	296400	perform these behaviors as white regardless of their actual race.
296400	300440	Do you believe that you have a different relationship with the social and political systems in society
300440	307660	based on who you are? You are a white, I'm assuming, I'm assuming middle-class Asian
307660	310660	American.
310660	312500	He must have misspoke, right?
312500	317120	White presenting, I should say.
317120	321940	You know what, dude? Mad props for the double down. Call him a fucking cracker, man. Fucking
321940	325580	go for it, dude.
325580	326580	I'm white presenting?
326580	327580	Wait, wait, wait.
327580	328580	What the what?
328580	330580	I can be white presenting Asian.
330580	331580	What the heck?
331580	333580	Let me rephrase that. Let me rephrase that.
333580	337580	Can you look at me right now? This is what, you know.
337580	341440	I can simplify that for you. I can simplify that for you if that upset you.
341440	346160	To be white now doesn't simply mean to have those genetics. It can also mean to be white
346160	347680	coded even if you're black.
347680	352520	If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump and you ain't black.
352520	357060	Which gets us into the codes themselves. Coding is progressive speak for describing
357060	362420	a person who adopts the qualities of a demographic without actually being a member of that demographic,
362420	366200	often with the implication that we should treat this person as if they are a member
366200	369580	of the demographic that they're coding themselves as, even if they aren't.
369580	374080	Of course, this concept fell flat on its face years before it was ever popularized with
374080	379580	popular transracial activists Shaun King and Rachel Dolezal. These people were laughed
379580	384700	at by the right wing and decried by the left wing as weird racists back during the internet
384700	386460	of five to seven years ago.
386460	391420	But in today's progressive terms, why wouldn't they just be black coded? Oh, I forgot because
391420	395340	whites can't code switch. That's racist. That British person who tried to transition
395340	397420	to being a Korean proved that.
397420	402460	Now coding doesn't have to refer only to behaviors but also to stereotypical features.
402460	406980	In other words, coding gives progressives a way to be racist. Appealing to stereotypes
406980	411440	before that was just racist. For example, you wouldn't say that this Arab woman has
411440	415980	dark skin and wavy black hair and other features that are common to her race, because if you
415980	420560	did that, you'd be racially profiling her, you bigot. But instead, you can simply describe
420560	424300	her features as racially coded and hey, problem solved.
424300	428060	This is just so ridiculous. In both cases, you'd be describing the physical features
428060	432420	that are common to a group of people. However, when you do it, you're stereotyping and you're
432420	436700	a racist. But when they do it, they're just describing features that are racially coded.
436700	441180	This conversation gets especially cancerous once we start talking about fictional characters.
441180	446480	Starfire is a common example. She's an alien with orange skin and wild untamed orange hair.
446480	450640	Black activists in the comic scene have been screaming for years that Starfire is black
450640	454380	coded, and that the more recent iterations of the character where her hair is straight
454380	459220	have been whitewashing a black character and therefore racist. Their argument relies almost
459220	464120	entirely on stereotypes of what black women should look like. An argument that would make
464120	469500	you a racist if you made it. Also, it's just factually wrong. As per her creator, Starfire
469500	475540	was based off of Iris Chacon, a Puerto Rican model from the 1970s, who had that exact red
475540	480520	hairstyle and orange California tan. Even some of the outfits she used in her photo
480520	485920	shoots were partially adopted as Starfire's superhero costume. But nonetheless, the progs
485920	490880	scream and cry about how racist it is if you deny that Starfire is black coded. You might
490880	495560	ask, why don't they just go for actual black characters that are commonly seen with Starfire,
495560	499660	like Cyborg and Bumblebee? They're both heroes, they're both positive black representation
499660	503960	for young black comic readers. Why would you fight over Starfire when there's already
503960	509120	actual black characters? The answer's obvious. Cyborg and Bumblebee's blackness is indisputable,
509120	512960	and therefore it's inconsequential. There's no argument to be had, no other interpretation
512960	516380	any reasonable person could come up with. There's nothing here to go viral, no hill
516380	521660	to die on, no virtue to signal. Nobody blinks an eye when you say that Cyborg is black coded,
521660	525260	because he's fucking black. But saying that Starfire is black coded? That's how you get
525260	530260	clicks on the internet. There are other non-human characters that progressives give the black
530260	534500	coded treatment to, but that conversation almost always plays out the exact same way.
534500	539460	So let's move on to queer coding. What's queer coding? Well, it's when a platonic heterosexual
539460	543580	friendship exists, and therefore gay people demand that they're gay. A great example
543580	547260	of this is Frodo and Sam from Lord of the Rings. Frodo and Sam aren't actually gay
547260	551360	in canon, they're simply good friends. But because their relationship is queer coded,
551360	556820	in the online LGBTQ community, in the gay canon, they're a couple. Authorial intent
556820	560580	doesn't matter, they will subvert and take away your spaces after all. The argument that
560580	565180	they commonly give for this is that in the past, to write about openly gay relationships
565180	568860	meant that you might get thrown in jail for obscenity. There's probably some truth to
568860	571920	that, that some characters would have been written to be more open about it had their
571920	575240	authors lived in a different time. Hell, even in the 90s, though they wouldn't have
575240	579240	been thrown in jail for it, on Deep Space Nine, Garak was censored from being bisexual
579240	582880	by the studio, which was the writer's original intent for that character. But for Frodo and
582880	587280	Sam? No. Tolkien was a devout Christian. Remember that whole thing with Spider-Gwen a couple
587280	591840	months ago, where people were transvestigating her as having large hands and wide shoulders,
591840	595620	and that haircut and the trans flag in her room meant that she had to be trans? It turns
595620	599480	out she wasn't. She was a cis woman, just a trans ally. But everyone's favorite stalker
599480	604320	brainlet, Quinton of Quinton Reviews, stated, even if she isn't canonically trans, I think
604320	608240	it's starting to seem pretty likely that her arc in the film was written as transcoded.
608240	613640	And I feel that's more important. This is the common lefty media analysis take nowadays.
613640	616640	What the actual story is doesn't matter. What the author originally intended can be
616640	620960	ignored. What matters is the coding. What politics can we overlay onto this media in
620960	625720	order to claim it as our cultural space? Here's the most cancerous one of all. Minor coding.
625960	630720	Yes, that is exactly how it sounds. When an of-age character has certain qualities that
630720	635680	are coded to be underage. Anime is full of these. Short, cute women in their late teens
635680	638600	or their 20s or even their 30s. Where, if you happen to mention that you like these
638600	644200	shows online, a ton of weird culture-warrior-obsessed progs will burst out of the woodwork to shriek
644200	648560	that you must be a pedophile. I remember when Elon Musk went viral for liking pictures of
648560	653900	Death Note's Misa Amane, a character who ranges between 19 and 24. And these Twitteroids
653900	657860	were out here saying, I'm sorry, but if you're like 50 years old, like in this,
657860	662580	you are a pedophile. Why? Not because of Misa's actual age, but because she's minor coded.
662580	666640	Here's another example that went viral when during this person's list of role-playing
666640	671920	tips for online RPs and tabletops and stuff like that, one of them was, don't lewd minor
671920	676340	coded characters. A minor coded character is a character who is considered an adult,
676340	679720	but exhibits so many child-like traits that it doesn't matter if they're an adult
679720	683940	or not, and thus they promote pedophilia and child porn. Typical traits of a minor
683940	689840	coded character include 1. A child-like appearance. The 1000-year-old dragon excuse, if you will.
689840	694340	2. Child-like hobbies. If they play with toys or exhibit other child-like traits, this is
694340	701160	a red flag. 3. Their height. Any girl under 5'7 is basically a red flag for being minor
701160	706160	coded, since that's the common height for children. Common height for children, jeez.
706160	710200	That's right, lads. If a girl character is under 5'7, she's minor coded, even
710200	715280	though the average height of a real-life woman is 5'4. This person got fucking destroyed
715280	719740	for this ridiculous take, the idea that adults acting childish promotes pedophilia. I guess
719740	724260	I promote pedophilia because I act childish every day. Uh, don't clip that. Again, like
724260	728600	the black-coded thing, there's tons of examples of this shit. They're easy enough to find
728600	732980	online, so let's move on. Now, Dev, you might ask, we're just talking about TV shows
732980	738140	and movies, who cares? Well, watch the Gramsci video already. But also, more importantly,
738140	742260	this doesn't stop at media. They actually treat real people like this. Cosplayers who
742260	747060	are of age, short, and flat-chested have been harassed for posting pictures of themselves
747060	752700	because their adult bodies apparently promote pedophilia. This person was demanded to provide
752700	756620	proof that they actually had small boobs so that they could be allowed to draw artwork
756620	761700	of their own characters who were also flat-chested. This person genuinely believes that the existence
761700	767140	of petite people promotes pedophilia. Here's a picture of an of-age Japanese model. Again,
767140	771500	flat chest. Apparently, according to progressives, if you find her attractive, you're a pedophile.
771500	776320	And finally, my friend V went viral with this take back during the ugly woman in video games
776320	780780	safe horny thing, posting not even a racy picture or anything, nothing underage, nothing
780780	785740	weird, just a random attractive woman's face. And this was called vaguely pedophilic. That's
785740	789820	right guys, if a woman is attractive at all, you're a pedophile now. Why? Because attraction
789820	794580	itself is obviously minor coded. Old people are ugly, young people are hot, therefore,
794580	799180	if you're attracted to any hot person ever, you're a pedophile. This sort of thing does
799180	803100	also happen to black people too, not just black characters, where if a black person
803100	806580	doesn't behave according to black stereotypes, they're white coded or they're whitewashed
806580	811340	or something. But I hate to say it, I guess I'm just kind of used to that level of retardation
811340	815820	at this point. I'm used to watching progressives shit on black people for not acting black.
815820	820700	I'm not used to the age thing though. And that brings us into the age gap discourse.
820700	824900	Have you ever noticed how progressives freak the fuck out whenever two of age people get
824900	829300	into a relationship if the age gap is too large for them? This conversation went viral
829300	833820	and boy it will make your head spin. I got called Jeffrey Epstein by a child because
833820	838180	I once dared to say that it's not grooming for a 21 year old to have sex with someone
838180	842880	in their thirties. Sorry to say, but the dude is kind of right. That age range is very much
842880	847080	a yellow light. Some are certainly mature enough to engage in sexual intercourse but
847080	852640	we have different standards. Pro tip, if you're in your thirties, don't fool with post miners.
852640	856920	Post miners now guys. That whole extended adolescence thing has gone a bit too far now,
856920	860960	hasn't it? You've heard of those pro-pedophile leftists? Well guess what? Meet the leftists
860960	865700	who are so anti-pedophile that they don't want younger adults fucking other adults.
865700	869600	People in their twenties are legal adults. If we can join the army, drink and take drugs,
869600	873820	pay taxes and have a job, then by god we can date people who are older. There is nothing
873820	878000	wrong with requiring a test in order to be licensed to engage in sex. My whole point
878000	882240	is that the post miner age range has tons of stunted development people, especially
882240	886660	neurodivergent people, and this protects them from older predators. So, while this is an
886660	891960	obviously retarded moral standard, it's still not even one that they hold themselves. Hey
891960	897780	all, I recently became the owner of a kid fur age regression chat room. It's for everyone
897780	902280	and anyone looking for a chill space to air your little or middle space feels. Marked
902280	906100	eighteen and up. If this guy believes that post miners, people who are over eighteen
906100	909860	but still relatively young, in their twenties, that they can't consent with older adults
909860	914380	in their thirties or more, why is he running a kink space for them? He is specifically
914380	918780	describing kinks that stunted development people have. This guy is violating his own
918780	922820	fucked up morality that normal people don't even adhere to. That's probably the most
922820	926740	retarded age gap discourse that I've seen. But it's not the only one. I've seen people
926740	931060	calling pedophile over thirty year olds dating twenty two year olds, forty five year olds
931060	935020	dating seventy nine year olds, Tom Cruise's age gap in the latest Mission Impossible sixty
935020	940100	one and forty one, and nineteen year olds dating twenty two year olds. Yes, for real.
940100	945220	All of these fucking people are totally cool with newly turned eighteen year olds immediately
945220	949460	spreading their asshole on only fans for less than the price of a fucking McDouble because
949460	953540	sex work is empowering, while at the same time morphing into Chris Hansen the minute
953540	957740	that a twenty three year old minor coded post minor woman identified uterus owner goes
957740	960620	on a date with a pedophilic twenty nine year old straight white male.
960620	965540	Anyway, that's the end of my saved up collection of cringe on codes and code switching. Most
965540	970140	of this stuff is people's natural puritanical tendencies bubbling back up and filtering
970140	974060	through the progressive repression. Basically, when someone is talking about codes, they're
974060	977580	trying to convince you of something that isn't, but looks like it is. That character is not
977580	981140	actually black. That woman is not actually underage. That person is not actually trans.
981140	985140	Those friends aren't actually gay, but they want society to treat those things as if they
985140	989460	were the case. Why? For some of them because it's good for their politics. For others
989460	993660	because it's good for their fetishes. And yet for others because they're fucking insane.
