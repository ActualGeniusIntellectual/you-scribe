00:00.000 --> 00:10.560
Gather around, kids. Today I'm going to explain to you some dumb internet nonsense,

00:10.560 --> 00:14.520
something that you'll never need to know or learn about if you just log off, but is

00:14.520 --> 00:18.560
nonetheless floating around the more deranged online spaces.

00:18.560 --> 00:23.160
This won't be on the test, any test. This is entirely useless information and will occupy

00:23.160 --> 00:28.980
valuable brain space from now until the end of your existence. You have a large but finite

00:28.980 --> 00:33.040
number of thoughts you're able to think before you die. And fair warning, you will

00:33.040 --> 00:38.100
be wasting a few of those precious neurons on this topic if you keep watching.

00:38.100 --> 00:43.900
So what is code switching? Otherwise known as code mixing or language alteration, code

00:43.900 --> 00:49.120
switching began as a term used to describe the behavior of multilingual people when switching

00:49.120 --> 00:54.260
between two different environments that also necessitated a switch in language, which carried

00:54.260 --> 00:55.900
with it a switch in mode of thought.

00:55.900 --> 01:00.940
The first time the term was ever used was in the 1951 anthropology book, Language of

01:00.940 --> 01:05.980
the Sierra Muac, a study of the languages of California's native tribes. It was used

01:05.980 --> 01:10.540
there to describe the common practice of those people in the modern era switching language

01:10.540 --> 01:15.240
mid-sentence when talking amongst people who knew both languages. Sometimes these language

01:15.240 --> 01:20.180
switches can become languages of their own, pulling from both parent languages and being

01:20.180 --> 01:25.340
partially understandable by their parent speakers, like Afrikaans or Tagalog. Code switching

01:25.340 --> 01:30.480
also refers to the practice of changing tone or dialect while changing language. A great

01:30.480 --> 01:34.820
example of this personally is my old college roommate. He was from a pretty rich family

01:34.820 --> 01:38.620
in Taiwan. When he spoke English with us, he was pretty down to earth, but when he spoke

01:38.620 --> 01:43.520
Chinese to his parents on the phone, the words and tone of voice that he used made him sound

01:43.520 --> 01:44.960
like a snobby rich kid.

01:44.960 --> 01:49.320
But most commonly in the West, code switching is used to refer to the tendency among black

01:49.320 --> 01:54.320
Americans to switch between African-American vernacular English when in a casual setting

01:54.320 --> 02:00.040
to a more formal and more white-sounding accent and word choice when in professional settings.

02:00.040 --> 02:04.320
Of course, within progressive circles, this means that when white people code switch,

02:04.320 --> 02:09.020
they're being racist. The first time this became a terminally online discourse cycle

02:09.020 --> 02:15.000
was back in 2019, when AOC code switched between the voice that she commonly uses in interviews

02:15.000 --> 02:42.080
and a very overemphasized Latin accent when saying Spanish words.

02:42.080 --> 02:45.720
Liberals when a white person code switches. Dude, that is seriously racist, man. What

02:45.720 --> 02:50.160
the fuck? Liberals when AOC code switches. Dude, that's totally okay. She can do it.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.160
She's a Latina.

02:51.160 --> 02:55.680
Innuendo Studios is someone with a huge amount of deep lore behind him that I'll have to

02:55.680 --> 02:59.860
cover one day. Now's not the time. But he is a leftoid through and through. He said

02:59.860 --> 03:04.400
in response to this whole thing, white people code switch all the time. They dial up and

03:04.400 --> 03:10.000
down southern accents. Slang, vulgarity, working class dialects. Don't say code switching

03:10.000 --> 03:13.760
when you mean to say, why is it okay for Latina to talk like a Latina, but not for

03:13.760 --> 03:18.500
white folks to do it as a joke? Somebody replied to him with, he's pretty much just interpreting

03:18.500 --> 03:22.920
code switching as deliberate racial parodies. That's going to spread like wildfire now,

03:22.920 --> 03:27.800
isn't it? And he said, it's an extreme version of values neutral governance. If it's okay

03:27.800 --> 03:31.420
for you to talk like a Latina, it should be okay for everyone to talk like a Latina.

03:31.420 --> 03:35.400
This 2019 discourse was the first time I'd ever encountered the concept of code switching

03:35.400 --> 03:38.440
and it was pretty interesting to me. So I decided to look into it. Innuendo Studios

03:38.440 --> 03:42.840
is drawing a line between code switching and talking like a Latina. But if the rest

03:42.840 --> 03:46.420
of this video is anything to go by, yeah, it literally is just talking like a Latina

03:46.420 --> 03:52.520
in this case. Also, yes, of course anybody can talk like a Latina, you fucking segregationist.

03:52.520 --> 03:57.120
Used in the terminally online culture warrior progressive kind of way, code switching refers

03:57.120 --> 04:02.120
to jumping between two cultural spaces or communities and adopting different codes in

04:02.120 --> 04:06.040
order to operate within them. These codes, they're kind of like masks that you can wear.

04:06.040 --> 04:10.500
You're restricted by your demographics and adopting the wrong mask is cultural appropriation.

04:10.500 --> 04:15.440
To use the AOC example, she's a racial minority. So if we follow progressive morality, she

04:15.440 --> 04:19.180
can adopt the Latina code as part of that minority, but she can also adopt the white

04:19.180 --> 04:24.080
code since she lives in a white dominated culture. And in order to access white institutions

04:24.080 --> 04:29.380
and white spaces, she has to assimilate herself into whiteness. The more extreme racial activists

04:29.380 --> 04:33.400
on the left consider this to be a capitulation to white supremacy and that these institutions

04:33.400 --> 04:40.020
should be made explicitly non-white by privileging not only non-white people, but non-white codes.

04:40.020 --> 04:43.940
This is why you often see stuff about how certain positive behaviors like hard work

04:43.940 --> 04:48.400
or punctuality, they are white behaviors because they're white coded and therefore our society

04:48.400 --> 04:52.700
views them as positive only because they're white. This renders all people who actually

04:52.700 --> 04:56.400
perform these behaviors as white regardless of their actual race.

04:56.400 --> 05:00.440
Do you believe that you have a different relationship with the social and political systems in society

05:00.440 --> 05:07.660
based on who you are? You are a white, I'm assuming, I'm assuming middle-class Asian

05:07.660 --> 05:10.660
American.

05:10.660 --> 05:12.500
He must have misspoke, right?

05:12.500 --> 05:17.120
White presenting, I should say.

05:17.120 --> 05:21.940
You know what, dude? Mad props for the double down. Call him a fucking cracker, man. Fucking

05:21.940 --> 05:25.580
go for it, dude.

05:25.580 --> 05:26.580
I'm white presenting?

05:26.580 --> 05:27.580
Wait, wait, wait.

05:27.580 --> 05:28.580
What the what?

05:28.580 --> 05:30.580
I can be white presenting Asian.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.580
What the heck?

05:31.580 --> 05:33.580
Let me rephrase that. Let me rephrase that.

05:33.580 --> 05:37.580
Can you look at me right now? This is what, you know.

05:37.580 --> 05:41.440
I can simplify that for you. I can simplify that for you if that upset you.

05:41.440 --> 05:46.160
To be white now doesn't simply mean to have those genetics. It can also mean to be white

05:46.160 --> 05:47.680
coded even if you're black.

05:47.680 --> 05:52.520
If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump and you ain't black.

05:52.520 --> 05:57.060
Which gets us into the codes themselves. Coding is progressive speak for describing

05:57.060 --> 06:02.420
a person who adopts the qualities of a demographic without actually being a member of that demographic,

06:02.420 --> 06:06.200
often with the implication that we should treat this person as if they are a member

06:06.200 --> 06:09.580
of the demographic that they're coding themselves as, even if they aren't.

06:09.580 --> 06:14.080
Of course, this concept fell flat on its face years before it was ever popularized with

06:14.080 --> 06:19.580
popular transracial activists Shaun King and Rachel Dolezal. These people were laughed

06:19.580 --> 06:24.700
at by the right wing and decried by the left wing as weird racists back during the internet

06:24.700 --> 06:26.460
of five to seven years ago.

06:26.460 --> 06:31.420
But in today's progressive terms, why wouldn't they just be black coded? Oh, I forgot because

06:31.420 --> 06:35.340
whites can't code switch. That's racist. That British person who tried to transition

06:35.340 --> 06:37.420
to being a Korean proved that.

06:37.420 --> 06:42.460
Now coding doesn't have to refer only to behaviors but also to stereotypical features.

06:42.460 --> 06:46.980
In other words, coding gives progressives a way to be racist. Appealing to stereotypes

06:46.980 --> 06:51.440
before that was just racist. For example, you wouldn't say that this Arab woman has

06:51.440 --> 06:55.980
dark skin and wavy black hair and other features that are common to her race, because if you

06:55.980 --> 07:00.560
did that, you'd be racially profiling her, you bigot. But instead, you can simply describe

07:00.560 --> 07:04.300
her features as racially coded and hey, problem solved.

07:04.300 --> 07:08.060
This is just so ridiculous. In both cases, you'd be describing the physical features

07:08.060 --> 07:12.420
that are common to a group of people. However, when you do it, you're stereotyping and you're

07:12.420 --> 07:16.700
a racist. But when they do it, they're just describing features that are racially coded.

07:16.700 --> 07:21.180
This conversation gets especially cancerous once we start talking about fictional characters.

07:21.180 --> 07:26.480
Starfire is a common example. She's an alien with orange skin and wild untamed orange hair.

07:26.480 --> 07:30.640
Black activists in the comic scene have been screaming for years that Starfire is black

07:30.640 --> 07:34.380
coded, and that the more recent iterations of the character where her hair is straight

07:34.380 --> 07:39.220
have been whitewashing a black character and therefore racist. Their argument relies almost

07:39.220 --> 07:44.120
entirely on stereotypes of what black women should look like. An argument that would make

07:44.120 --> 07:49.500
you a racist if you made it. Also, it's just factually wrong. As per her creator, Starfire

07:49.500 --> 07:55.540
was based off of Iris Chacon, a Puerto Rican model from the 1970s, who had that exact red

07:55.540 --> 08:00.520
hairstyle and orange California tan. Even some of the outfits she used in her photo

08:00.520 --> 08:05.920
shoots were partially adopted as Starfire's superhero costume. But nonetheless, the progs

08:05.920 --> 08:10.880
scream and cry about how racist it is if you deny that Starfire is black coded. You might

08:10.880 --> 08:15.560
ask, why don't they just go for actual black characters that are commonly seen with Starfire,

08:15.560 --> 08:19.660
like Cyborg and Bumblebee? They're both heroes, they're both positive black representation

08:19.660 --> 08:23.960
for young black comic readers. Why would you fight over Starfire when there's already

08:23.960 --> 08:29.120
actual black characters? The answer's obvious. Cyborg and Bumblebee's blackness is indisputable,

08:29.120 --> 08:32.960
and therefore it's inconsequential. There's no argument to be had, no other interpretation

08:32.960 --> 08:36.380
any reasonable person could come up with. There's nothing here to go viral, no hill

08:36.380 --> 08:41.660
to die on, no virtue to signal. Nobody blinks an eye when you say that Cyborg is black coded,

08:41.660 --> 08:45.260
because he's fucking black. But saying that Starfire is black coded? That's how you get

08:45.260 --> 08:50.260
clicks on the internet. There are other non-human characters that progressives give the black

08:50.260 --> 08:54.500
coded treatment to, but that conversation almost always plays out the exact same way.

08:54.500 --> 08:59.460
So let's move on to queer coding. What's queer coding? Well, it's when a platonic heterosexual

08:59.460 --> 09:03.580
friendship exists, and therefore gay people demand that they're gay. A great example

09:03.580 --> 09:07.260
of this is Frodo and Sam from Lord of the Rings. Frodo and Sam aren't actually gay

09:07.260 --> 09:11.360
in canon, they're simply good friends. But because their relationship is queer coded,

09:11.360 --> 09:16.820
in the online LGBTQ community, in the gay canon, they're a couple. Authorial intent

09:16.820 --> 09:20.580
doesn't matter, they will subvert and take away your spaces after all. The argument that

09:20.580 --> 09:25.180
they commonly give for this is that in the past, to write about openly gay relationships

09:25.180 --> 09:28.860
meant that you might get thrown in jail for obscenity. There's probably some truth to

09:28.860 --> 09:31.920
that, that some characters would have been written to be more open about it had their

09:31.920 --> 09:35.240
authors lived in a different time. Hell, even in the 90s, though they wouldn't have

09:35.240 --> 09:39.240
been thrown in jail for it, on Deep Space Nine, Garak was censored from being bisexual

09:39.240 --> 09:42.880
by the studio, which was the writer's original intent for that character. But for Frodo and

09:42.880 --> 09:47.280
Sam? No. Tolkien was a devout Christian. Remember that whole thing with Spider-Gwen a couple

09:47.280 --> 09:51.840
months ago, where people were transvestigating her as having large hands and wide shoulders,

09:51.840 --> 09:55.620
and that haircut and the trans flag in her room meant that she had to be trans? It turns

09:55.620 --> 09:59.480
out she wasn't. She was a cis woman, just a trans ally. But everyone's favorite stalker

09:59.480 --> 10:04.320
brainlet, Quinton of Quinton Reviews, stated, even if she isn't canonically trans, I think

10:04.320 --> 10:08.240
it's starting to seem pretty likely that her arc in the film was written as transcoded.

10:08.240 --> 10:13.640
And I feel that's more important. This is the common lefty media analysis take nowadays.

10:13.640 --> 10:16.640
What the actual story is doesn't matter. What the author originally intended can be

10:16.640 --> 10:20.960
ignored. What matters is the coding. What politics can we overlay onto this media in

10:20.960 --> 10:25.720
order to claim it as our cultural space? Here's the most cancerous one of all. Minor coding.

10:25.960 --> 10:30.720
Yes, that is exactly how it sounds. When an of-age character has certain qualities that

10:30.720 --> 10:35.680
are coded to be underage. Anime is full of these. Short, cute women in their late teens

10:35.680 --> 10:38.600
or their 20s or even their 30s. Where, if you happen to mention that you like these

10:38.600 --> 10:44.200
shows online, a ton of weird culture-warrior-obsessed progs will burst out of the woodwork to shriek

10:44.200 --> 10:48.560
that you must be a pedophile. I remember when Elon Musk went viral for liking pictures of

10:48.560 --> 10:53.900
Death Note's Misa Amane, a character who ranges between 19 and 24. And these Twitteroids

10:53.900 --> 10:57.860
were out here saying, I'm sorry, but if you're like 50 years old, like in this,

10:57.860 --> 11:02.580
you are a pedophile. Why? Not because of Misa's actual age, but because she's minor coded.

11:02.580 --> 11:06.640
Here's another example that went viral when during this person's list of role-playing

11:06.640 --> 11:11.920
tips for online RPs and tabletops and stuff like that, one of them was, don't lewd minor

11:11.920 --> 11:16.340
coded characters. A minor coded character is a character who is considered an adult,

11:16.340 --> 11:19.720
but exhibits so many child-like traits that it doesn't matter if they're an adult

11:19.720 --> 11:23.940
or not, and thus they promote pedophilia and child porn. Typical traits of a minor

11:23.940 --> 11:29.840
coded character include 1. A child-like appearance. The 1000-year-old dragon excuse, if you will.

11:29.840 --> 11:34.340
2. Child-like hobbies. If they play with toys or exhibit other child-like traits, this is

11:34.340 --> 11:41.160
a red flag. 3. Their height. Any girl under 5'7 is basically a red flag for being minor

11:41.160 --> 11:46.160
coded, since that's the common height for children. Common height for children, jeez.

11:46.160 --> 11:50.200
That's right, lads. If a girl character is under 5'7, she's minor coded, even

11:50.200 --> 11:55.280
though the average height of a real-life woman is 5'4. This person got fucking destroyed

11:55.280 --> 11:59.740
for this ridiculous take, the idea that adults acting childish promotes pedophilia. I guess

11:59.740 --> 12:04.260
I promote pedophilia because I act childish every day. Uh, don't clip that. Again, like

12:04.260 --> 12:08.600
the black-coded thing, there's tons of examples of this shit. They're easy enough to find

12:08.600 --> 12:12.980
online, so let's move on. Now, Dev, you might ask, we're just talking about TV shows

12:12.980 --> 12:18.140
and movies, who cares? Well, watch the Gramsci video already. But also, more importantly,

12:18.140 --> 12:22.260
this doesn't stop at media. They actually treat real people like this. Cosplayers who

12:22.260 --> 12:27.060
are of age, short, and flat-chested have been harassed for posting pictures of themselves

12:27.060 --> 12:32.700
because their adult bodies apparently promote pedophilia. This person was demanded to provide

12:32.700 --> 12:36.620
proof that they actually had small boobs so that they could be allowed to draw artwork

12:36.620 --> 12:41.700
of their own characters who were also flat-chested. This person genuinely believes that the existence

12:41.700 --> 12:47.140
of petite people promotes pedophilia. Here's a picture of an of-age Japanese model. Again,

12:47.140 --> 12:51.500
flat chest. Apparently, according to progressives, if you find her attractive, you're a pedophile.

12:51.500 --> 12:56.320
And finally, my friend V went viral with this take back during the ugly woman in video games

12:56.320 --> 13:00.780
safe horny thing, posting not even a racy picture or anything, nothing underage, nothing

13:00.780 --> 13:05.740
weird, just a random attractive woman's face. And this was called vaguely pedophilic. That's

13:05.740 --> 13:09.820
right guys, if a woman is attractive at all, you're a pedophile now. Why? Because attraction

13:09.820 --> 13:14.580
itself is obviously minor coded. Old people are ugly, young people are hot, therefore,

13:14.580 --> 13:19.180
if you're attracted to any hot person ever, you're a pedophile. This sort of thing does

13:19.180 --> 13:23.100
also happen to black people too, not just black characters, where if a black person

13:23.100 --> 13:26.580
doesn't behave according to black stereotypes, they're white coded or they're whitewashed

13:26.580 --> 13:31.340
or something. But I hate to say it, I guess I'm just kind of used to that level of retardation

13:31.340 --> 13:35.820
at this point. I'm used to watching progressives shit on black people for not acting black.

13:35.820 --> 13:40.700
I'm not used to the age thing though. And that brings us into the age gap discourse.

13:40.700 --> 13:44.900
Have you ever noticed how progressives freak the fuck out whenever two of age people get

13:44.900 --> 13:49.300
into a relationship if the age gap is too large for them? This conversation went viral

13:49.300 --> 13:53.820
and boy it will make your head spin. I got called Jeffrey Epstein by a child because

13:53.820 --> 13:58.180
I once dared to say that it's not grooming for a 21 year old to have sex with someone

13:58.180 --> 14:02.880
in their thirties. Sorry to say, but the dude is kind of right. That age range is very much

14:02.880 --> 14:07.080
a yellow light. Some are certainly mature enough to engage in sexual intercourse but

14:07.080 --> 14:12.640
we have different standards. Pro tip, if you're in your thirties, don't fool with post miners.

14:12.640 --> 14:16.920
Post miners now guys. That whole extended adolescence thing has gone a bit too far now,

14:16.920 --> 14:20.960
hasn't it? You've heard of those pro-pedophile leftists? Well guess what? Meet the leftists

14:20.960 --> 14:25.700
who are so anti-pedophile that they don't want younger adults fucking other adults.

14:25.700 --> 14:29.600
People in their twenties are legal adults. If we can join the army, drink and take drugs,

14:29.600 --> 14:33.820
pay taxes and have a job, then by god we can date people who are older. There is nothing

14:33.820 --> 14:38.000
wrong with requiring a test in order to be licensed to engage in sex. My whole point

14:38.000 --> 14:42.240
is that the post miner age range has tons of stunted development people, especially

14:42.240 --> 14:46.660
neurodivergent people, and this protects them from older predators. So, while this is an

14:46.660 --> 14:51.960
obviously retarded moral standard, it's still not even one that they hold themselves. Hey

14:51.960 --> 14:57.780
all, I recently became the owner of a kid fur age regression chat room. It's for everyone

14:57.780 --> 15:02.280
and anyone looking for a chill space to air your little or middle space feels. Marked

15:02.280 --> 15:06.100
eighteen and up. If this guy believes that post miners, people who are over eighteen

15:06.100 --> 15:09.860
but still relatively young, in their twenties, that they can't consent with older adults

15:09.860 --> 15:14.380
in their thirties or more, why is he running a kink space for them? He is specifically

15:14.380 --> 15:18.780
describing kinks that stunted development people have. This guy is violating his own

15:18.780 --> 15:22.820
fucked up morality that normal people don't even adhere to. That's probably the most

15:22.820 --> 15:26.740
retarded age gap discourse that I've seen. But it's not the only one. I've seen people

15:26.740 --> 15:31.060
calling pedophile over thirty year olds dating twenty two year olds, forty five year olds

15:31.060 --> 15:35.020
dating seventy nine year olds, Tom Cruise's age gap in the latest Mission Impossible sixty

15:35.020 --> 15:40.100
one and forty one, and nineteen year olds dating twenty two year olds. Yes, for real.

15:40.100 --> 15:45.220
All of these fucking people are totally cool with newly turned eighteen year olds immediately

15:45.220 --> 15:49.460
spreading their asshole on only fans for less than the price of a fucking McDouble because

15:49.460 --> 15:53.540
sex work is empowering, while at the same time morphing into Chris Hansen the minute

15:53.540 --> 15:57.740
that a twenty three year old minor coded post minor woman identified uterus owner goes

15:57.740 --> 16:00.620
on a date with a pedophilic twenty nine year old straight white male.

16:00.620 --> 16:05.540
Anyway, that's the end of my saved up collection of cringe on codes and code switching. Most

16:05.540 --> 16:10.140
of this stuff is people's natural puritanical tendencies bubbling back up and filtering

16:10.140 --> 16:14.060
through the progressive repression. Basically, when someone is talking about codes, they're

16:14.060 --> 16:17.580
trying to convince you of something that isn't, but looks like it is. That character is not

16:17.580 --> 16:21.140
actually black. That woman is not actually underage. That person is not actually trans.

16:21.140 --> 16:25.140
Those friends aren't actually gay, but they want society to treat those things as if they

16:25.140 --> 16:29.460
were the case. Why? For some of them because it's good for their politics. For others

16:29.460 --> 16:33.660
because it's good for their fetishes. And yet for others because they're fucking insane.
