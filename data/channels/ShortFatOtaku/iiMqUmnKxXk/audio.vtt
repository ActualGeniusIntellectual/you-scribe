00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
It's often been said that people don't read Nietzsche, they only read quotations

00:04.000 --> 00:08.760
of him online and consider them to be cool, although I think that tendency started long

00:08.760 --> 00:10.400
before the internet was even invented.

00:10.400 --> 00:14.280
It's no stretch to say that he's probably the most frequently misinterpreted philosopher

00:14.280 --> 00:15.280
of all time.

00:15.280 --> 00:20.520
Hell, when Germany can create not one but two totalitarian ideologies, justified by

00:20.520 --> 00:25.160
his philosophy, while simultaneously running counter to it, you know you've got somebody

00:25.160 --> 00:26.960
on your hands that's pretty tough to read.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.960
I'd like to bring up one specific Nietzschean quote though, God is dead.

00:30.960 --> 00:35.200
Whenever it's repeated in the modern era, it's done so triumphantly, considered to

00:35.200 --> 00:39.160
be a statement of humanity's moving past the dogma and ignorance of religion, into

00:39.160 --> 00:42.080
a modern era of reason and science.

00:42.080 --> 00:46.920
And fair enough, Nietzsche had many criticisms to levy against religion in his writings.

00:46.920 --> 00:52.480
But the phrase, God is dead was stated not triumphantly, but sorrowfully, and in a state

00:52.480 --> 00:53.480
of blind panic.

00:53.760 --> 00:57.480
I actually had the opportunity to read some of Nietzsche's writings, thanks intro to

00:57.480 --> 01:01.600
philosophy, and one passage I was able to study with a bit more depth was the famous

01:01.600 --> 01:03.380
God is dead excerpt.

01:03.380 --> 01:07.820
Nietzsche used that phrase multiple times, but the one that everyone quotes is from section

01:07.820 --> 01:10.520
125 of The Gay Science.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.840
Just so we're all on the same page, here it is.

01:23.480 --> 01:28.360
Why is he lost? said one.

01:28.360 --> 01:30.520
Has he strayed away like a child? said another.

01:30.520 --> 01:32.100
Or does he keep himself hidden?

01:32.100 --> 01:33.300
Is he afraid of us?

01:33.300 --> 01:34.580
Has he taken a sea voyage?

01:34.580 --> 01:35.680
Has he immigrated?

01:35.680 --> 01:38.120
The people cried out laughingly, all in a hubbub.

01:38.120 --> 01:42.040
The insane man jumped into their midst and transfixed them with his glances.

01:42.040 --> 01:44.120
Where is God gone? he called out.

01:44.120 --> 01:46.720
I mean to tell you, we have killed him, you and I.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.460
We are all his murderers.

01:48.460 --> 01:49.540
But how have we done it?

01:49.540 --> 01:51.140
How are we able to drink up the sea?

01:51.140 --> 01:53.940
Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the whole horizon?

01:53.940 --> 01:56.680
What did we do when we loosened this earth from its sun?

01:56.680 --> 01:58.000
Whither now does it move?

01:58.000 --> 01:59.080
Whither do we move?

01:59.080 --> 02:00.360
Away from all suns?

02:00.360 --> 02:02.800
Do we not dash on unceasingly?

02:02.800 --> 02:05.740
Backwards sideways forwards in all directions?

02:05.740 --> 02:07.680
Is there still an above and below?

02:07.680 --> 02:11.200
Do we not stray as though through infinite nothingness?

02:11.200 --> 02:13.920
Does not empty space breathe upon us?

02:13.920 --> 02:15.440
Has it not become colder?

02:15.440 --> 02:18.860
Does not night come on continually, darker and darker?

02:18.860 --> 02:21.760
Shall we not have to light lanterns in the morning?

02:21.760 --> 02:25.500
Do we not hear the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God?

02:25.500 --> 02:30.320
Do we not smell the defined putrefaction, for even gods putrefy?

02:30.320 --> 02:33.420
God is dead, God remains dead, and we have killed him.

02:33.420 --> 02:37.400
How shall we console ourselves, the most murderous of all murderers?

02:37.400 --> 02:41.560
The holiest and the mightiest that the world has hitherto possessed has bled to death under

02:41.560 --> 02:43.000
our knife.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.640
Who will wipe the blood from us?

02:44.640 --> 02:46.840
With what water could we cleanse ourselves?

02:46.860 --> 02:49.860
What lustrums, what sacred games shall we have to devise?

02:49.860 --> 02:52.960
Is not the magnitude of this deed too great for us?

02:52.960 --> 02:57.860
Shall we not ourselves have to become as gods, merely to seem worthy of it?

02:57.860 --> 03:01.940
There never was a greater event, and on account of it, all who are born after us belong to

03:01.940 --> 03:04.340
a higher history than any history hitherto.

03:04.340 --> 03:07.600
Here the madman was silent, and looked again at his hearers.

03:07.600 --> 03:11.040
They were also silent, and looked at him in surprise.

03:11.040 --> 03:15.820
At last he threw his lantern on the ground, so that it broke in pieces and was extinguished.

03:15.820 --> 03:19.560
I come too early, he then said, I am not yet at the right time.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.560
This prodigious event is still on its way, and is travelling.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.640
It has not yet reached men's ears.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.500
Lightning and thunder need time.

03:26.500 --> 03:30.620
Deeds need time, even after they're done, to be seen and heard.

03:30.620 --> 03:34.120
This deed is as yet further from them than the furthest star, and yet they have done

03:34.120 --> 03:35.120
it.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.800
There is nothing about the death of God that is considered to be triumphant in the tale

03:37.800 --> 03:38.800
of the madman.

03:38.800 --> 03:44.000
Despite Nietzsche's many criticisms of religion, he realized one very important thing.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.800
The collective morality of Western civilization, and its unique focus on the sovereign individual,

03:48.800 --> 03:52.100
was built on the foundation of the belief in God.

03:52.100 --> 03:55.860
Even for those people that didn't actually believe in God themselves, the ethical system

03:55.860 --> 03:59.540
that they operated on was formed by a society based in the Christian faith.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.740
And it's no surprise, look at the coordinates of Christianity.

04:02.740 --> 04:07.280
When Christ was asked, which of the many rules is the most important, if in practical situations

04:07.280 --> 04:11.160
they come into conflict which one takes priority, he said, Love thy neighbor.

04:11.180 --> 04:15.660
And Christ himself is, eventually, unjustly nailed to a cross and tortured to death.

04:15.660 --> 04:18.600
But he doesn't go into the situation naively, nor does he run from it.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.600
He sees it coming, he does the right thing, and he bears his burdens.

04:21.600 --> 04:25.300
Even if you don't believe in the metaphysical aspects of the faith, and I certainly don't

04:25.300 --> 04:30.000
as an atheist, how could it be anything but the case that that specific story would eventually

04:30.000 --> 04:35.100
spawn a civilization that values individual rights and rewards individual responsibility?

04:35.100 --> 04:38.660
And when we eventually progressed to a point that faith in God himself was no longer a

04:39.140 --> 04:42.500
When we became intelligent enough to actually understand that Christ was not the son of

04:42.500 --> 04:47.220
the divine, but simply the ideal man which we all aspire to reach in our own way, as

04:47.220 --> 04:51.900
expressed in a tale told by primitives, well, what else was going to happen to us, if not

04:51.900 --> 04:53.700
the complete collapse of our ethical systems?

04:53.700 --> 04:56.780
It's like the fruit of the poisonous tree from a legal perspective.

04:56.780 --> 05:01.460
If you remove belief in God, then nearly 2000 years of moral innovation and advancement

05:01.460 --> 05:02.460
go with it.

05:02.460 --> 05:04.160
That's the point of the tale of the madman.

05:04.160 --> 05:08.260
Those people who laugh at the madman for looking for God are those who follow the morality

05:08.860 --> 05:11.660
of a social system that they are fundamentally at odds with and they just don't know it

05:11.660 --> 05:12.660
yet.

05:12.660 --> 05:16.140
For them, all it'll take is one foundational event to push them over the edge into nihilism

05:16.140 --> 05:17.540
and lack of meaning.

05:17.540 --> 05:22.220
Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the whole horizon sounds to me like Nietzsche's prediction

05:22.220 --> 05:24.220
of the creation of postmodernism.

05:24.220 --> 05:27.940
With God dead and all of the moral grounding that sprung from him collapsed, of course

05:27.940 --> 05:32.260
we would create a philosophy where nothing has any inherent meaning, nothing is concrete,

05:32.260 --> 05:35.060
and it's all just a product of human systems.

05:35.060 --> 05:39.540
Natural barriers, like say horizons, would have to be wiped away as a product not of

05:39.540 --> 05:41.740
the natural world but human corruption.

05:41.740 --> 05:45.420
With what water could we cleanse ourselves, what lustrums, what sacred game shall we have

05:45.420 --> 05:49.820
to devise, sounds, to me, like the predictions of the multitude of new systems that would

05:49.820 --> 05:53.980
rise to prominence in the 20th century in an attempt to forge a new morality after God

05:53.980 --> 05:55.900
had been swept away.

05:55.900 --> 06:00.820
In his other writings, Nietzsche accurately predicted, back in the late 1800s, the absolute

06:00.820 --> 06:05.040
catastrophe of both the fascist state and the communist revolutions that would grip

06:05.040 --> 06:09.340
the world decades after his death, as well as the over 100 million dead their efforts

06:09.340 --> 06:10.340
would bring.

06:10.340 --> 06:13.180
I don't think Nietzsche's argument was that, therefore, we should have remained in

06:13.180 --> 06:17.180
ignorance about the nature of the metaphysical, and simply continued to believe in God blindly

06:17.180 --> 06:21.620
for the rest of eternity, but I do think he understood that even as a move away from religion

06:21.620 --> 06:25.380
was necessary for modern science to flourish, it would also cause a complete undermining

06:25.380 --> 06:29.000
of any sense of morality, and that we were in for a lot of suffering and death until

06:29.000 --> 06:32.240
we all figured out how to maintain a moral structure without a foundation, and that's

06:32.240 --> 06:34.520
a problem we still haven't solved, in a sense.

06:34.520 --> 06:38.320
Now I know what you're thinking, Dev, this video is about the universal basic income,

06:38.320 --> 06:42.520
and you haven't even mentioned it yet, you're right, but that's because the problem of

06:42.520 --> 06:45.720
the death of God and the problem of automation are the same problem.

06:45.720 --> 06:49.360
When the moral rug was pulled out from beneath our collective feet, humanity scrambled to

06:49.360 --> 06:52.680
cling to whatever they could that would provide them a structure, a morality they could adopt

06:52.680 --> 06:54.560
in place of the old faith.

06:54.560 --> 06:58.680
Fascist Italy settled on the state, Nazi Germany settled on the race, the communists settled

06:58.680 --> 07:02.920
on the worker, the Americans settled on freedom, and though freedom has some problems, it's

07:02.920 --> 07:06.400
probably the most solid choice so far as it at least emulates the concept of the sovereign

07:06.400 --> 07:09.800
individual in Christ without actually needing a Christ-like figure to aspire to.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.740
But everyone suffered, and on some level still suffers, from a lack of meaning in their lives.

07:13.740 --> 07:16.960
The argument against religion is that the meaning that it provides to people is fundamentally

07:16.960 --> 07:21.720
false, maybe so, but it's still meaning, it's still a beacon that can light your

07:21.720 --> 07:25.560
way, even if only to point to a place where you can develop a new sense of meaning.

07:25.560 --> 07:29.360
But if God is dead, if there's no more meaning to be derived from religion because

07:29.360 --> 07:32.280
we've basically become too smart for it, where do we go now?

07:32.280 --> 07:36.120
The fundamental question is what do we do when our lives lack an objective?

07:36.120 --> 07:40.600
And the universal basic income is a really, really bad answer to that question.

07:40.600 --> 07:44.300
The assumption is that automation will eventually reduce the total number of jobs.

07:44.300 --> 07:47.720
The new industries that are springing up to create and maintain automated systems will

07:47.720 --> 07:51.640
require fewer working people in them than the jobs they replaced.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.360
Maybe that's the case, maybe not.

07:53.360 --> 07:54.360
I'm not sure.

07:54.360 --> 07:57.440
It might be that it's not the case, that we will fundamentally never run out of work

07:57.440 --> 08:01.200
to do, and that the automation problem will solve itself over time, as people move into

08:01.200 --> 08:03.080
emerging industries.

08:03.080 --> 08:06.660
But for the sake of argument, let's assume that it is the case, that the new jobs that

08:06.660 --> 08:10.380
spring up as a result of automation won't be enough to employ all the people who have

08:10.380 --> 08:11.920
lost their jobs to the machine.

08:11.920 --> 08:14.980
Is the solution really to give them a universal basic income?

08:14.980 --> 08:19.680
Is the solution actually that the state comes in to nurse them on that UBI teat, since they

08:19.680 --> 08:23.240
have become like children, unable to provide for themselves, and no longer afforded the

08:23.240 --> 08:26.120
dignity of standing on their own two feet like adults?

08:26.120 --> 08:28.560
Is throwing money at the problem really the solution?

08:28.560 --> 08:32.080
Because I think we all know what happens when you give someone who has no direction in life

08:32.080 --> 08:35.880
a whole bunch of money, instantly all of their worst vices are indulged, and they're worse

08:35.880 --> 08:36.880
off for it.

08:36.880 --> 08:40.540
If somebody's job is replaced by a robot, and they've turned into an alcoholic recluse

08:40.540 --> 08:44.000
who does nothing but watch TV and drink all day, do you actually think that handing them

08:44.000 --> 08:47.360
a bag of government issued money is going to help the situation out, or will he just

08:47.360 --> 08:48.840
drink himself to death?

08:48.840 --> 08:52.240
It would seem to me that the proponents of the universal basic income believe that the

08:52.240 --> 08:55.080
problem they're tackling is unemployed people don't have money.

08:55.080 --> 08:58.600
But I think it's more like unemployed people don't have anything to do with their lives.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.980
There's also other problems to consider.

09:00.980 --> 09:04.700
The larger a state's bureaucracy, generally, the less free the people living within that

09:04.700 --> 09:05.700
state are.

09:05.700 --> 09:08.460
Europe was a location where peasants could generally grow their own food.

09:08.460 --> 09:12.460
As a result of this, Europe's society developed futilely, and political power was devolved

09:12.460 --> 09:17.560
down to landowners and local lords, which eventually evolved into the first modern democracies.

09:17.560 --> 09:21.920
To contrast, the Middle East, lacking access to water in the same way as Europe, required

09:21.920 --> 09:26.080
large-scale irrigation projects to cultivate, which was not a task that individual peasant

09:26.080 --> 09:27.080
families could handle.

09:27.080 --> 09:32.040
A centralized state was required, and as a result, a culture of absolute monarchies,

09:32.040 --> 09:35.760
and later, absolute theocracies and dictatorships was established.

09:35.760 --> 09:39.500
I don't think it would be a good idea for us to restructure things such that the average

09:39.500 --> 09:42.360
person's economic dependence is shunted through the state.

09:42.360 --> 09:46.640
That's already happened, to a lesser extent, to the United States' black population.

09:46.640 --> 09:50.500
And look at the absolute ruin the welfare state has wrought upon the black family.

09:50.500 --> 09:54.080
Or you can look at banana republics, or nations based solely on oil extraction.

09:54.080 --> 09:57.260
Situations where local participation in the economy of the state is minimal.

09:57.260 --> 09:59.300
They're all autocratic governments.

09:59.300 --> 10:03.300
In essence, a nation that generates its wealth from its citizens needs to keep those citizens

10:03.300 --> 10:05.180
happy to survive.

10:05.180 --> 10:06.440
That means human rights.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.980
A nation that generates its wealth from its resources simply needs to maintain a military

10:09.980 --> 10:14.620
that can protect those resources, whether that's an oil well or an automated factory.

10:14.620 --> 10:16.220
Human rights no longer figure into the picture.

10:16.220 --> 10:21.180
A universal basic income makes the people unnecessary components of the state, and that

10:21.180 --> 10:23.900
is a road we do not want to go down.

10:23.900 --> 10:25.020
Automation will continue.

10:25.020 --> 10:26.780
Pandora's box has already been opened.

10:26.780 --> 10:30.180
It's another form of advancement, much in the same way that our reasoning shifted away

10:30.180 --> 10:32.300
from religion and towards science.

10:32.300 --> 10:36.460
And like the death of God, automation is another chapter in the problem of meaning.

10:36.460 --> 10:38.100
What do I do with my life?

10:38.100 --> 10:39.740
What do I spend my time working towards?

10:39.740 --> 10:41.000
What do I value?

10:41.000 --> 10:44.980
The tribulations that happen to a religious person when he ceases to believe in God, and

10:44.980 --> 10:49.180
the tribulations that happen to a proud family man that loses his breadwinner job are the

10:49.180 --> 10:52.580
same tribulations, they suffer from the same problem.

10:52.580 --> 10:54.260
So what solves it?

10:54.260 --> 10:56.260
I'm not sure exactly.

10:56.260 --> 10:59.180
But I do know that having a purpose is way more important than having money.

10:59.180 --> 11:03.060
I mean, money's not nothing, but the provision of money without purpose seems to lead people

11:03.060 --> 11:08.220
to ruin, while taking on responsibility seems to lead people to purpose, at least eventually.

11:08.220 --> 11:12.140
So society needs mechanisms that allow people to discover their purpose and begin to provide

11:12.140 --> 11:13.580
meaning for their own lives.

11:13.580 --> 11:17.820
And this meaning must, in some way, necessarily also provide money, because the dangers of

11:17.820 --> 11:21.600
having all economic activity flow through the state's mechanisms is just too high.

11:21.600 --> 11:25.500
The desire of the people for human rights, protected by the state, as demanded from our

11:25.500 --> 11:29.260
current position of relative strength, may be enough to safeguard us from our descent

11:29.260 --> 11:33.540
into servitude, only so long as those rights include the right to earn our own living through

11:33.540 --> 11:36.120
our own work, rather than living off of handouts.

11:36.120 --> 11:40.260
If that means that the responsibility is on us for the creation of entirely new industries

11:40.260 --> 11:42.380
to replace the old ones, then so be it.

11:42.380 --> 11:46.220
Better for us to grope around in the unknown, in an attempt to find our own prosperity,

11:46.220 --> 11:48.340
than to settle for what the state feels we're worth.

11:48.340 --> 11:52.160
The last time we encountered this problem, Nietzsche predicted death on a scale we had

11:52.160 --> 11:54.300
never seen before, and he was right.

11:54.300 --> 11:56.060
We can't repeat those same mistakes.
