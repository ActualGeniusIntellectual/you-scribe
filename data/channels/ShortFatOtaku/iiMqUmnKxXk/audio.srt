1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's often been said that people don't read Nietzsche, they only read quotations

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,760
of him online and consider them to be cool, although I think that tendency started long

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,400
before the internet was even invented.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,280
It's no stretch to say that he's probably the most frequently misinterpreted philosopher

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,280
of all time.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,520
Hell, when Germany can create not one but two totalitarian ideologies, justified by

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,160
his philosophy, while simultaneously running counter to it, you know you've got somebody

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,960
on your hands that's pretty tough to read.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,960
I'd like to bring up one specific Nietzschean quote though, God is dead.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,200
Whenever it's repeated in the modern era, it's done so triumphantly, considered to

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,160
be a statement of humanity's moving past the dogma and ignorance of religion, into

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,080
a modern era of reason and science.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,920
And fair enough, Nietzsche had many criticisms to levy against religion in his writings.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,480
But the phrase, God is dead was stated not triumphantly, but sorrowfully, and in a state

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,480
of blind panic.

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,480
I actually had the opportunity to read some of Nietzsche's writings, thanks intro to

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,600
philosophy, and one passage I was able to study with a bit more depth was the famous

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,380
God is dead excerpt.

19
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,820
Nietzsche used that phrase multiple times, but the one that everyone quotes is from section

20
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,520
125 of The Gay Science.

21
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,840
Just so we're all on the same page, here it is.

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,360
Why is he lost? said one.

23
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,520
Has he strayed away like a child? said another.

24
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,100
Or does he keep himself hidden?

25
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,300
Is he afraid of us?

26
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,580
Has he taken a sea voyage?

27
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,680
Has he immigrated?

28
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,120
The people cried out laughingly, all in a hubbub.

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,040
The insane man jumped into their midst and transfixed them with his glances.

30
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,120
Where is God gone? he called out.

31
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,720
I mean to tell you, we have killed him, you and I.

32
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,460
We are all his murderers.

33
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,540
But how have we done it?

34
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,140
How are we able to drink up the sea?

35
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,940
Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the whole horizon?

36
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,680
What did we do when we loosened this earth from its sun?

37
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,000
Whither now does it move?

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,080
Whither do we move?

39
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,360
Away from all suns?

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,800
Do we not dash on unceasingly?

41
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,740
Backwards sideways forwards in all directions?

42
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,680
Is there still an above and below?

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,200
Do we not stray as though through infinite nothingness?

44
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,920
Does not empty space breathe upon us?

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,440
Has it not become colder?

46
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,860
Does not night come on continually, darker and darker?

47
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,760
Shall we not have to light lanterns in the morning?

48
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,500
Do we not hear the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God?

49
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,320
Do we not smell the defined putrefaction, for even gods putrefy?

50
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,420
God is dead, God remains dead, and we have killed him.

51
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,400
How shall we console ourselves, the most murderous of all murderers?

52
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,560
The holiest and the mightiest that the world has hitherto possessed has bled to death under

53
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,000
our knife.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,640
Who will wipe the blood from us?

55
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,840
With what water could we cleanse ourselves?

56
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,860
What lustrums, what sacred games shall we have to devise?

57
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,960
Is not the magnitude of this deed too great for us?

58
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,860
Shall we not ourselves have to become as gods, merely to seem worthy of it?

59
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,940
There never was a greater event, and on account of it, all who are born after us belong to

60
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,340
a higher history than any history hitherto.

61
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,600
Here the madman was silent, and looked again at his hearers.

62
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,040
They were also silent, and looked at him in surprise.

63
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,820
At last he threw his lantern on the ground, so that it broke in pieces and was extinguished.

64
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,560
I come too early, he then said, I am not yet at the right time.

65
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,560
This prodigious event is still on its way, and is travelling.

66
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,640
It has not yet reached men's ears.

67
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,500
Lightning and thunder need time.

68
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,620
Deeds need time, even after they're done, to be seen and heard.

69
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,120
This deed is as yet further from them than the furthest star, and yet they have done

70
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
it.

71
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,800
There is nothing about the death of God that is considered to be triumphant in the tale

72
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
of the madman.

73
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,000
Despite Nietzsche's many criticisms of religion, he realized one very important thing.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,800
The collective morality of Western civilization, and its unique focus on the sovereign individual,

75
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,100
was built on the foundation of the belief in God.

76
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,860
Even for those people that didn't actually believe in God themselves, the ethical system

77
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,540
that they operated on was formed by a society based in the Christian faith.

78
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,740
And it's no surprise, look at the coordinates of Christianity.

79
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,280
When Christ was asked, which of the many rules is the most important, if in practical situations

80
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,160
they come into conflict which one takes priority, he said, Love thy neighbor.

81
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,660
And Christ himself is, eventually, unjustly nailed to a cross and tortured to death.

82
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,600
But he doesn't go into the situation naively, nor does he run from it.

83
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
He sees it coming, he does the right thing, and he bears his burdens.

84
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,300
Even if you don't believe in the metaphysical aspects of the faith, and I certainly don't

85
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,000
as an atheist, how could it be anything but the case that that specific story would eventually

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,100
spawn a civilization that values individual rights and rewards individual responsibility?

87
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,660
And when we eventually progressed to a point that faith in God himself was no longer a

88
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,500
When we became intelligent enough to actually understand that Christ was not the son of

89
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,220
the divine, but simply the ideal man which we all aspire to reach in our own way, as

90
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,900
expressed in a tale told by primitives, well, what else was going to happen to us, if not

91
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,700
the complete collapse of our ethical systems?

92
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,780
It's like the fruit of the poisonous tree from a legal perspective.

93
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,460
If you remove belief in God, then nearly 2000 years of moral innovation and advancement

94
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,460
go with it.

95
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,160
That's the point of the tale of the madman.

96
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,260
Those people who laugh at the madman for looking for God are those who follow the morality

97
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,660
of a social system that they are fundamentally at odds with and they just don't know it

98
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,660
yet.

99
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,140
For them, all it'll take is one foundational event to push them over the edge into nihilism

100
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,540
and lack of meaning.

101
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,220
Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the whole horizon sounds to me like Nietzsche's prediction

102
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,220
of the creation of postmodernism.

103
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,940
With God dead and all of the moral grounding that sprung from him collapsed, of course

104
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,260
we would create a philosophy where nothing has any inherent meaning, nothing is concrete,

105
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,060
and it's all just a product of human systems.

106
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,540
Natural barriers, like say horizons, would have to be wiped away as a product not of

107
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,740
the natural world but human corruption.

108
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,420
With what water could we cleanse ourselves, what lustrums, what sacred game shall we have

109
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,820
to devise, sounds, to me, like the predictions of the multitude of new systems that would

110
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,980
rise to prominence in the 20th century in an attempt to forge a new morality after God

111
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,900
had been swept away.

112
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,820
In his other writings, Nietzsche accurately predicted, back in the late 1800s, the absolute

113
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,040
catastrophe of both the fascist state and the communist revolutions that would grip

114
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,340
the world decades after his death, as well as the over 100 million dead their efforts

115
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,340
would bring.

116
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,180
I don't think Nietzsche's argument was that, therefore, we should have remained in

117
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,180
ignorance about the nature of the metaphysical, and simply continued to believe in God blindly

118
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,620
for the rest of eternity, but I do think he understood that even as a move away from religion

119
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,380
was necessary for modern science to flourish, it would also cause a complete undermining

120
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,000
of any sense of morality, and that we were in for a lot of suffering and death until

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,240
we all figured out how to maintain a moral structure without a foundation, and that's

122
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,520
a problem we still haven't solved, in a sense.

123
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,320
Now I know what you're thinking, Dev, this video is about the universal basic income,

124
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,520
and you haven't even mentioned it yet, you're right, but that's because the problem of

125
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,720
the death of God and the problem of automation are the same problem.

126
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,360
When the moral rug was pulled out from beneath our collective feet, humanity scrambled to

127
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,680
cling to whatever they could that would provide them a structure, a morality they could adopt

128
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,560
in place of the old faith.

129
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,680
Fascist Italy settled on the state, Nazi Germany settled on the race, the communists settled

130
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,920
on the worker, the Americans settled on freedom, and though freedom has some problems, it's

131
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,400
probably the most solid choice so far as it at least emulates the concept of the sovereign

132
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,800
individual in Christ without actually needing a Christ-like figure to aspire to.

133
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,740
But everyone suffered, and on some level still suffers, from a lack of meaning in their lives.

134
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,960
The argument against religion is that the meaning that it provides to people is fundamentally

135
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,720
false, maybe so, but it's still meaning, it's still a beacon that can light your

136
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,560
way, even if only to point to a place where you can develop a new sense of meaning.

137
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,360
But if God is dead, if there's no more meaning to be derived from religion because

138
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,280
we've basically become too smart for it, where do we go now?

139
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,120
The fundamental question is what do we do when our lives lack an objective?

140
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,600
And the universal basic income is a really, really bad answer to that question.

141
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,300
The assumption is that automation will eventually reduce the total number of jobs.

142
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,720
The new industries that are springing up to create and maintain automated systems will

143
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,640
require fewer working people in them than the jobs they replaced.

144
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,360
Maybe that's the case, maybe not.

145
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
I'm not sure.

146
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,440
It might be that it's not the case, that we will fundamentally never run out of work

147
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,200
to do, and that the automation problem will solve itself over time, as people move into

148
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,080
emerging industries.

149
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,660
But for the sake of argument, let's assume that it is the case, that the new jobs that

150
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,380
spring up as a result of automation won't be enough to employ all the people who have

151
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,920
lost their jobs to the machine.

152
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,980
Is the solution really to give them a universal basic income?

153
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,680
Is the solution actually that the state comes in to nurse them on that UBI teat, since they

154
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,240
have become like children, unable to provide for themselves, and no longer afforded the

155
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,120
dignity of standing on their own two feet like adults?

156
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,560
Is throwing money at the problem really the solution?

157
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,080
Because I think we all know what happens when you give someone who has no direction in life

158
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,880
a whole bunch of money, instantly all of their worst vices are indulged, and they're worse

159
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,880
off for it.

160
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,540
If somebody's job is replaced by a robot, and they've turned into an alcoholic recluse

161
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,000
who does nothing but watch TV and drink all day, do you actually think that handing them

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,360
a bag of government issued money is going to help the situation out, or will he just

163
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,840
drink himself to death?

164
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,240
It would seem to me that the proponents of the universal basic income believe that the

165
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,080
problem they're tackling is unemployed people don't have money.

166
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,600
But I think it's more like unemployed people don't have anything to do with their lives.

167
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,980
There's also other problems to consider.

168
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,700
The larger a state's bureaucracy, generally, the less free the people living within that

169
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,700
state are.

170
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,460
Europe was a location where peasants could generally grow their own food.

171
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,460
As a result of this, Europe's society developed futilely, and political power was devolved

172
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,560
down to landowners and local lords, which eventually evolved into the first modern democracies.

173
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,920
To contrast, the Middle East, lacking access to water in the same way as Europe, required

174
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,080
large-scale irrigation projects to cultivate, which was not a task that individual peasant

175
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
families could handle.

176
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,040
A centralized state was required, and as a result, a culture of absolute monarchies,

177
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,760
and later, absolute theocracies and dictatorships was established.

178
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,500
I don't think it would be a good idea for us to restructure things such that the average

179
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,360
person's economic dependence is shunted through the state.

180
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,640
That's already happened, to a lesser extent, to the United States' black population.

181
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,500
And look at the absolute ruin the welfare state has wrought upon the black family.

182
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,080
Or you can look at banana republics, or nations based solely on oil extraction.

183
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,260
Situations where local participation in the economy of the state is minimal.

184
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,300
They're all autocratic governments.

185
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,300
In essence, a nation that generates its wealth from its citizens needs to keep those citizens

186
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,180
happy to survive.

187
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,440
That means human rights.

188
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,980
A nation that generates its wealth from its resources simply needs to maintain a military

189
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,620
that can protect those resources, whether that's an oil well or an automated factory.

190
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,220
Human rights no longer figure into the picture.

191
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,180
A universal basic income makes the people unnecessary components of the state, and that

192
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,900
is a road we do not want to go down.

193
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,020
Automation will continue.

194
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,780
Pandora's box has already been opened.

195
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,180
It's another form of advancement, much in the same way that our reasoning shifted away

196
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,300
from religion and towards science.

197
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,460
And like the death of God, automation is another chapter in the problem of meaning.

198
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,100
What do I do with my life?

199
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,740
What do I spend my time working towards?

200
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,000
What do I value?

201
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,980
The tribulations that happen to a religious person when he ceases to believe in God, and

202
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,180
the tribulations that happen to a proud family man that loses his breadwinner job are the

203
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,580
same tribulations, they suffer from the same problem.

204
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,260
So what solves it?

205
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,260
I'm not sure exactly.

206
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,180
But I do know that having a purpose is way more important than having money.

207
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,060
I mean, money's not nothing, but the provision of money without purpose seems to lead people

208
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,220
to ruin, while taking on responsibility seems to lead people to purpose, at least eventually.

209
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,140
So society needs mechanisms that allow people to discover their purpose and begin to provide

210
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,580
meaning for their own lives.

211
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,820
And this meaning must, in some way, necessarily also provide money, because the dangers of

212
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,600
having all economic activity flow through the state's mechanisms is just too high.

213
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,500
The desire of the people for human rights, protected by the state, as demanded from our

214
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,260
current position of relative strength, may be enough to safeguard us from our descent

215
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,540
into servitude, only so long as those rights include the right to earn our own living through

216
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,120
our own work, rather than living off of handouts.

217
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,260
If that means that the responsibility is on us for the creation of entirely new industries

218
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,380
to replace the old ones, then so be it.

219
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,220
Better for us to grope around in the unknown, in an attempt to find our own prosperity,

220
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,340
than to settle for what the state feels we're worth.

221
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,160
The last time we encountered this problem, Nietzsche predicted death on a scale we had

222
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,300
never seen before, and he was right.

223
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,060
We can't repeat those same mistakes.
