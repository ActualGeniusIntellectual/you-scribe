0	4000	It's often been said that people don't read Nietzsche, they only read quotations
4000	8760	of him online and consider them to be cool, although I think that tendency started long
8760	10400	before the internet was even invented.
10400	14280	It's no stretch to say that he's probably the most frequently misinterpreted philosopher
14280	15280	of all time.
15280	20520	Hell, when Germany can create not one but two totalitarian ideologies, justified by
20520	25160	his philosophy, while simultaneously running counter to it, you know you've got somebody
25160	26960	on your hands that's pretty tough to read.
27000	30960	I'd like to bring up one specific Nietzschean quote though, God is dead.
30960	35200	Whenever it's repeated in the modern era, it's done so triumphantly, considered to
35200	39160	be a statement of humanity's moving past the dogma and ignorance of religion, into
39160	42080	a modern era of reason and science.
42080	46920	And fair enough, Nietzsche had many criticisms to levy against religion in his writings.
46920	52480	But the phrase, God is dead was stated not triumphantly, but sorrowfully, and in a state
52480	53480	of blind panic.
53760	57480	I actually had the opportunity to read some of Nietzsche's writings, thanks intro to
57480	61600	philosophy, and one passage I was able to study with a bit more depth was the famous
61600	63380	God is dead excerpt.
63380	67820	Nietzsche used that phrase multiple times, but the one that everyone quotes is from section
67820	70520	125 of The Gay Science.
70520	72840	Just so we're all on the same page, here it is.
83480	88360	Why is he lost? said one.
88360	90520	Has he strayed away like a child? said another.
90520	92100	Or does he keep himself hidden?
92100	93300	Is he afraid of us?
93300	94580	Has he taken a sea voyage?
94580	95680	Has he immigrated?
95680	98120	The people cried out laughingly, all in a hubbub.
98120	102040	The insane man jumped into their midst and transfixed them with his glances.
102040	104120	Where is God gone? he called out.
104120	106720	I mean to tell you, we have killed him, you and I.
106720	108460	We are all his murderers.
108460	109540	But how have we done it?
109540	111140	How are we able to drink up the sea?
111140	113940	Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the whole horizon?
113940	116680	What did we do when we loosened this earth from its sun?
116680	118000	Whither now does it move?
118000	119080	Whither do we move?
119080	120360	Away from all suns?
120360	122800	Do we not dash on unceasingly?
122800	125740	Backwards sideways forwards in all directions?
125740	127680	Is there still an above and below?
127680	131200	Do we not stray as though through infinite nothingness?
131200	133920	Does not empty space breathe upon us?
133920	135440	Has it not become colder?
135440	138860	Does not night come on continually, darker and darker?
138860	141760	Shall we not have to light lanterns in the morning?
141760	145500	Do we not hear the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God?
145500	150320	Do we not smell the defined putrefaction, for even gods putrefy?
150320	153420	God is dead, God remains dead, and we have killed him.
153420	157400	How shall we console ourselves, the most murderous of all murderers?
157400	161560	The holiest and the mightiest that the world has hitherto possessed has bled to death under
161560	163000	our knife.
163000	164640	Who will wipe the blood from us?
164640	166840	With what water could we cleanse ourselves?
166860	169860	What lustrums, what sacred games shall we have to devise?
169860	172960	Is not the magnitude of this deed too great for us?
172960	177860	Shall we not ourselves have to become as gods, merely to seem worthy of it?
177860	181940	There never was a greater event, and on account of it, all who are born after us belong to
181940	184340	a higher history than any history hitherto.
184340	187600	Here the madman was silent, and looked again at his hearers.
187600	191040	They were also silent, and looked at him in surprise.
191040	195820	At last he threw his lantern on the ground, so that it broke in pieces and was extinguished.
195820	199560	I come too early, he then said, I am not yet at the right time.
199560	202560	This prodigious event is still on its way, and is travelling.
202560	204640	It has not yet reached men's ears.
204640	206500	Lightning and thunder need time.
206500	210620	Deeds need time, even after they're done, to be seen and heard.
210620	214120	This deed is as yet further from them than the furthest star, and yet they have done
214120	215120	it.
215120	217800	There is nothing about the death of God that is considered to be triumphant in the tale
217800	218800	of the madman.
218800	224000	Despite Nietzsche's many criticisms of religion, he realized one very important thing.
224000	228800	The collective morality of Western civilization, and its unique focus on the sovereign individual,
228800	232100	was built on the foundation of the belief in God.
232100	235860	Even for those people that didn't actually believe in God themselves, the ethical system
235860	239540	that they operated on was formed by a society based in the Christian faith.
239540	242740	And it's no surprise, look at the coordinates of Christianity.
242740	247280	When Christ was asked, which of the many rules is the most important, if in practical situations
247280	251160	they come into conflict which one takes priority, he said, Love thy neighbor.
251180	255660	And Christ himself is, eventually, unjustly nailed to a cross and tortured to death.
255660	258600	But he doesn't go into the situation naively, nor does he run from it.
258600	261600	He sees it coming, he does the right thing, and he bears his burdens.
261600	265300	Even if you don't believe in the metaphysical aspects of the faith, and I certainly don't
265300	270000	as an atheist, how could it be anything but the case that that specific story would eventually
270000	275100	spawn a civilization that values individual rights and rewards individual responsibility?
275100	278660	And when we eventually progressed to a point that faith in God himself was no longer a
279140	282500	When we became intelligent enough to actually understand that Christ was not the son of
282500	287220	the divine, but simply the ideal man which we all aspire to reach in our own way, as
287220	291900	expressed in a tale told by primitives, well, what else was going to happen to us, if not
291900	293700	the complete collapse of our ethical systems?
293700	296780	It's like the fruit of the poisonous tree from a legal perspective.
296780	301460	If you remove belief in God, then nearly 2000 years of moral innovation and advancement
301460	302460	go with it.
302460	304160	That's the point of the tale of the madman.
304160	308260	Those people who laugh at the madman for looking for God are those who follow the morality
308860	311660	of a social system that they are fundamentally at odds with and they just don't know it
311660	312660	yet.
312660	316140	For them, all it'll take is one foundational event to push them over the edge into nihilism
316140	317540	and lack of meaning.
317540	322220	Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the whole horizon sounds to me like Nietzsche's prediction
322220	324220	of the creation of postmodernism.
324220	327940	With God dead and all of the moral grounding that sprung from him collapsed, of course
327940	332260	we would create a philosophy where nothing has any inherent meaning, nothing is concrete,
332260	335060	and it's all just a product of human systems.
335060	339540	Natural barriers, like say horizons, would have to be wiped away as a product not of
339540	341740	the natural world but human corruption.
341740	345420	With what water could we cleanse ourselves, what lustrums, what sacred game shall we have
345420	349820	to devise, sounds, to me, like the predictions of the multitude of new systems that would
349820	353980	rise to prominence in the 20th century in an attempt to forge a new morality after God
353980	355900	had been swept away.
355900	360820	In his other writings, Nietzsche accurately predicted, back in the late 1800s, the absolute
360820	365040	catastrophe of both the fascist state and the communist revolutions that would grip
365040	369340	the world decades after his death, as well as the over 100 million dead their efforts
369340	370340	would bring.
370340	373180	I don't think Nietzsche's argument was that, therefore, we should have remained in
373180	377180	ignorance about the nature of the metaphysical, and simply continued to believe in God blindly
377180	381620	for the rest of eternity, but I do think he understood that even as a move away from religion
381620	385380	was necessary for modern science to flourish, it would also cause a complete undermining
385380	389000	of any sense of morality, and that we were in for a lot of suffering and death until
389000	392240	we all figured out how to maintain a moral structure without a foundation, and that's
392240	394520	a problem we still haven't solved, in a sense.
394520	398320	Now I know what you're thinking, Dev, this video is about the universal basic income,
398320	402520	and you haven't even mentioned it yet, you're right, but that's because the problem of
402520	405720	the death of God and the problem of automation are the same problem.
405720	409360	When the moral rug was pulled out from beneath our collective feet, humanity scrambled to
409360	412680	cling to whatever they could that would provide them a structure, a morality they could adopt
412680	414560	in place of the old faith.
414560	418680	Fascist Italy settled on the state, Nazi Germany settled on the race, the communists settled
418680	422920	on the worker, the Americans settled on freedom, and though freedom has some problems, it's
422920	426400	probably the most solid choice so far as it at least emulates the concept of the sovereign
426400	429800	individual in Christ without actually needing a Christ-like figure to aspire to.
429800	433740	But everyone suffered, and on some level still suffers, from a lack of meaning in their lives.
433740	436960	The argument against religion is that the meaning that it provides to people is fundamentally
436960	441720	false, maybe so, but it's still meaning, it's still a beacon that can light your
441720	445560	way, even if only to point to a place where you can develop a new sense of meaning.
445560	449360	But if God is dead, if there's no more meaning to be derived from religion because
449360	452280	we've basically become too smart for it, where do we go now?
452280	456120	The fundamental question is what do we do when our lives lack an objective?
456120	460600	And the universal basic income is a really, really bad answer to that question.
460600	464300	The assumption is that automation will eventually reduce the total number of jobs.
464300	467720	The new industries that are springing up to create and maintain automated systems will
467720	471640	require fewer working people in them than the jobs they replaced.
471640	473360	Maybe that's the case, maybe not.
473360	474360	I'm not sure.
474360	477440	It might be that it's not the case, that we will fundamentally never run out of work
477440	481200	to do, and that the automation problem will solve itself over time, as people move into
481200	483080	emerging industries.
483080	486660	But for the sake of argument, let's assume that it is the case, that the new jobs that
486660	490380	spring up as a result of automation won't be enough to employ all the people who have
490380	491920	lost their jobs to the machine.
491920	494980	Is the solution really to give them a universal basic income?
494980	499680	Is the solution actually that the state comes in to nurse them on that UBI teat, since they
499680	503240	have become like children, unable to provide for themselves, and no longer afforded the
503240	506120	dignity of standing on their own two feet like adults?
506120	508560	Is throwing money at the problem really the solution?
508560	512080	Because I think we all know what happens when you give someone who has no direction in life
512080	515880	a whole bunch of money, instantly all of their worst vices are indulged, and they're worse
515880	516880	off for it.
516880	520540	If somebody's job is replaced by a robot, and they've turned into an alcoholic recluse
520540	524000	who does nothing but watch TV and drink all day, do you actually think that handing them
524000	527360	a bag of government issued money is going to help the situation out, or will he just
527360	528840	drink himself to death?
528840	532240	It would seem to me that the proponents of the universal basic income believe that the
532240	535080	problem they're tackling is unemployed people don't have money.
535080	538600	But I think it's more like unemployed people don't have anything to do with their lives.
538600	540980	There's also other problems to consider.
540980	544700	The larger a state's bureaucracy, generally, the less free the people living within that
544700	545700	state are.
545700	548460	Europe was a location where peasants could generally grow their own food.
548460	552460	As a result of this, Europe's society developed futilely, and political power was devolved
552460	557560	down to landowners and local lords, which eventually evolved into the first modern democracies.
557560	561920	To contrast, the Middle East, lacking access to water in the same way as Europe, required
561920	566080	large-scale irrigation projects to cultivate, which was not a task that individual peasant
566080	567080	families could handle.
567080	572040	A centralized state was required, and as a result, a culture of absolute monarchies,
572040	575760	and later, absolute theocracies and dictatorships was established.
575760	579500	I don't think it would be a good idea for us to restructure things such that the average
579500	582360	person's economic dependence is shunted through the state.
582360	586640	That's already happened, to a lesser extent, to the United States' black population.
586640	590500	And look at the absolute ruin the welfare state has wrought upon the black family.
590500	594080	Or you can look at banana republics, or nations based solely on oil extraction.
594080	597260	Situations where local participation in the economy of the state is minimal.
597260	599300	They're all autocratic governments.
599300	603300	In essence, a nation that generates its wealth from its citizens needs to keep those citizens
603300	605180	happy to survive.
605180	606440	That means human rights.
606440	609980	A nation that generates its wealth from its resources simply needs to maintain a military
609980	614620	that can protect those resources, whether that's an oil well or an automated factory.
614620	616220	Human rights no longer figure into the picture.
616220	621180	A universal basic income makes the people unnecessary components of the state, and that
621180	623900	is a road we do not want to go down.
623900	625020	Automation will continue.
625020	626780	Pandora's box has already been opened.
626780	630180	It's another form of advancement, much in the same way that our reasoning shifted away
630180	632300	from religion and towards science.
632300	636460	And like the death of God, automation is another chapter in the problem of meaning.
636460	638100	What do I do with my life?
638100	639740	What do I spend my time working towards?
639740	641000	What do I value?
641000	644980	The tribulations that happen to a religious person when he ceases to believe in God, and
644980	649180	the tribulations that happen to a proud family man that loses his breadwinner job are the
649180	652580	same tribulations, they suffer from the same problem.
652580	654260	So what solves it?
654260	656260	I'm not sure exactly.
656260	659180	But I do know that having a purpose is way more important than having money.
659180	663060	I mean, money's not nothing, but the provision of money without purpose seems to lead people
663060	668220	to ruin, while taking on responsibility seems to lead people to purpose, at least eventually.
668220	672140	So society needs mechanisms that allow people to discover their purpose and begin to provide
672140	673580	meaning for their own lives.
673580	677820	And this meaning must, in some way, necessarily also provide money, because the dangers of
677820	681600	having all economic activity flow through the state's mechanisms is just too high.
681600	685500	The desire of the people for human rights, protected by the state, as demanded from our
685500	689260	current position of relative strength, may be enough to safeguard us from our descent
689260	693540	into servitude, only so long as those rights include the right to earn our own living through
693540	696120	our own work, rather than living off of handouts.
696120	700260	If that means that the responsibility is on us for the creation of entirely new industries
700260	702380	to replace the old ones, then so be it.
702380	706220	Better for us to grope around in the unknown, in an attempt to find our own prosperity,
706220	708340	than to settle for what the state feels we're worth.
708340	712160	The last time we encountered this problem, Nietzsche predicted death on a scale we had
712160	714300	never seen before, and he was right.
714300	716060	We can't repeat those same mistakes.
