0	4640	So everything is up on the Bitchute channel, finally, it's all, it's all been uploaded.
4640	8240	If you've been watching the feed on your Bitchute account and wondering why
8800	12560	it's basically been spammed by my uploads, it's because I've uploaded the entire backlog,
12560	17600	so if anything doesn't work, let me know and I'll re-upload it. But this should be everything.
17600	22720	The next site I'm working on uploading everything to is Odyssey, that's odyssey.com,
22720	27680	and they have a real handy feature that Bitchute says it has, but it doesn't really
27680	32240	work all that well in my opinion. It's the auto-uploader, and actually Odyssey's will just take
32240	38320	the entire account, so that's currently happening right now. All 463 videos are being uploaded to
38320	42240	my Odyssey channel, so I won't have to do it manually, that's quite nice. And any videos
42240	46960	that happen to be missing I'll just put up manually, it's not a big deal. And here it is,
46960	56240	it's at odyssey.com slash at, short ferotaku, there's an at in the URL, okay I guess, I mean,
56240	59920	alright, so that's what it is. Just look up short ferotaku, you'll probably find me on there.
59920	62400	Continue setting up your account, what's this, I thought I finished it.
65440	73360	It's just confetti. There's nothing here, it's just confetti. Okay, well anyway, head over to
73360	79760	short ferotaku on Odyssey, that will be another alt-tech platform that I'm currently prioritizing
79760	83760	once I start making content again, which by the way will be very soon. Basically once I have all
83760	88560	my alt-tech channels set up, if YouTube hasn't re-monetized me by then, I'll just forge ahead
88560	93280	on these ones, because frankly, these places seem to be the future, don't they? Alright guys,
93280	95600	I'll see you later, thanks very much, I love you.
