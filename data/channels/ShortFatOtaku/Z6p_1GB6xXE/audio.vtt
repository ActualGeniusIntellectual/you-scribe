So everything is up on the Bitchute channel, finally, it's all, it's all been uploaded.

00:04.640 --> 00:08.240
If you've been watching the feed on your Bitchute account and wondering why

00:08.800 --> 00:12.560
it's basically been spammed by my uploads, it's because I've uploaded the entire backlog,

00:12.560 --> 00:17.600
so if anything doesn't work, let me know and I'll re-upload it. But this should be everything.

00:17.600 --> 00:22.720
The next site I'm working on uploading everything to is Odyssey, that's odyssey.com,

00:22.720 --> 00:27.680
and they have a real handy feature that Bitchute says it has, but it doesn't really

00:27.680 --> 00:32.240
work all that well in my opinion. It's the auto-uploader, and actually Odyssey's will just take

00:32.240 --> 00:38.320
the entire account, so that's currently happening right now. All 463 videos are being uploaded to

00:38.320 --> 00:42.240
my Odyssey channel, so I won't have to do it manually, that's quite nice. And any videos

00:42.240 --> 00:46.960
that happen to be missing I'll just put up manually, it's not a big deal. And here it is,

00:46.960 --> 00:56.240
it's at odyssey.com slash at, short ferotaku, there's an at in the URL, okay I guess, I mean,

00:56.240 --> 00:59.920
alright, so that's what it is. Just look up short ferotaku, you'll probably find me on there.

00:59.920 --> 01:02.400
Continue setting up your account, what's this, I thought I finished it.

01:05.440 --> 01:13.360
It's just confetti. There's nothing here, it's just confetti. Okay, well anyway, head over to

01:13.360 --> 01:19.760
short ferotaku on Odyssey, that will be another alt-tech platform that I'm currently prioritizing

01:19.760 --> 01:23.760
once I start making content again, which by the way will be very soon. Basically once I have all

01:23.760 --> 01:28.560
my alt-tech channels set up, if YouTube hasn't re-monetized me by then, I'll just forge ahead

01:28.560 --> 01:33.280
on these ones, because frankly, these places seem to be the future, don't they? Alright guys,

01:33.280 --> 01:35.600
I'll see you later, thanks very much, I love you.
