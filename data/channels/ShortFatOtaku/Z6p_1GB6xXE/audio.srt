00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
So everything is up on the Bitchute channel, finally, it's all, it's all been uploaded.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,240
If you've been watching the feed on your Bitchute account and wondering why

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,560
it's basically been spammed by my uploads, it's because I've uploaded the entire backlog,

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,600
so if anything doesn't work, let me know and I'll re-upload it. But this should be everything.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,720
The next site I'm working on uploading everything to is Odyssey, that's odyssey.com,

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,680
and they have a real handy feature that Bitchute says it has, but it doesn't really

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,240
work all that well in my opinion. It's the auto-uploader, and actually Odyssey's will just take

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,320
the entire account, so that's currently happening right now. All 463 videos are being uploaded to

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,240
my Odyssey channel, so I won't have to do it manually, that's quite nice. And any videos

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,960
that happen to be missing I'll just put up manually, it's not a big deal. And here it is,

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:56,240
it's at odyssey.com slash at, short ferotaku, there's an at in the URL, okay I guess, I mean,

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,920
alright, so that's what it is. Just look up short ferotaku, you'll probably find me on there.

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,400
Continue setting up your account, what's this, I thought I finished it.

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:13,360
It's just confetti. There's nothing here, it's just confetti. Okay, well anyway, head over to

15
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,760
short ferotaku on Odyssey, that will be another alt-tech platform that I'm currently prioritizing

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,760
once I start making content again, which by the way will be very soon. Basically once I have all

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,560
my alt-tech channels set up, if YouTube hasn't re-monetized me by then, I'll just forge ahead

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,280
on these ones, because frankly, these places seem to be the future, don't they? Alright guys,

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,600
I'll see you later, thanks very much, I love you.
