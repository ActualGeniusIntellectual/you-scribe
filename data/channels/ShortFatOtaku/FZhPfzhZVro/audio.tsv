0	11280	Hello, my friends. Welcome to TikTok Tuesday. No waiting, no nonsense. Let's jump right
11280	12280	into it.
12280	16400	Oh, it's a fight at the cafe. Transphobic.
16400	29760	Oh, is the trans person working there? I think so.
29760	38000	Hi, get out. You are trespassing now. You are trespassing. Get out. Get out. You are
38000	39000	trespassing.
39000	42320	Apparently you are trespassing. Since something sounds phobic.
42320	48880	Did you? Oh shit, she attacked her. Oh. That's beyond the pale now.
48880	52920	You want to leave me the phone. You want to leave me the phone. Let go of me. I've got
52920	53920	plenty of witnesses.
53920	58240	Nope. Listen, you don't get the phone. Even if they called you a slur, you don't get their
58240	61000	phone, dude. Or sorry, dudette.
61000	66000	Man, Karen's versus Tranny's. Whoever wins, we lose. This is one of those cases where
66000	69240	you can't really tell like who actually started it, who's in the right, who's in the wrong.
69240	73440	What I do know is that as the employee of the establishment, the trans person seems
73440	76680	to be in the right to just kick them out. They can do that. They're an employee. They
76680	80400	work there. The customer doesn't have a unilateral right to be there. They are guests and they
80400	85760	can be kicked out at any time. However, the trans person basically loses the encounter
85760	88200	the minute that she decides to attack the cameraman.
88200	91880	You got to remember that even if you might be right in one case, you can't let your moral
91880	94160	righteousness destroy your position.
94160	106160	Looks like an airport. Whoa. Dude, dude. Airports. You don't want to screw around in an airport.
106160	117160	You put on a no-fly list. What are they doing? What warrants this reaction? Oh, the fight's
117160	135360	breaking out. Yeah, this is a fast track to put on a federal list, guys. Come on. My God.
135360	139160	What happened? Was there flight delayed or something? Whatever it was, it can't be worth
139160	143240	getting banned from flying for life. Jeez, you guys got to think ahead to the future,
143240	145520	not just, you know, get mad in the moment.
145520	150760	I got a zero on a project proposal in my class because I use the term biological women, which
150760	154720	is apparently not allowed anymore. She even said it was a good project proposal.
154720	159000	Hold on, hold on. I got to pause this and read this. Olivia, this is a solid proposal.
159000	163100	However, the terms biological women are exclusionary and are not allowed in this course as they
163100	173220	further reinforce heteronormativity. Is this like a biology class? I mean, it's bad anywhere,
173220	175140	but it's especially bad in biology class.
175140	180380	And I 100% know that this is like the most biased grade ever because my project is about
180380	185700	transgenders competing in biological women's sports. How am I supposed to do my final project
185700	190020	if I can't use the word biological women? But that's what my project is about.
190020	195140	I wonder if she used the term cis woman, since that is the accepted progressive speak
195140	198500	for this sort of thing. If she did trans women, cis women and compared them as two different
198500	203460	classes, or would that be like implying that trans women are somehow different from cis
203460	209920	women, even though they are, right? But there is like a push in the very fringe of the activist
209920	214140	ideology to erase all differences between trans and cis women. That's why you just call
214140	217820	them all women. And it's like, well, I mean, some men have penises and it's like, well,
217820	220740	is there a difference between the women who have penises and the women who don't? No,
220740	225120	you bigot. So I don't know. Like she probably could have avoided this, but it's still fucking
225120	227700	retarded isn't it? Like you should be able to say biological women because that's what
227700	231020	they are. I gotta be honest, I'm actually like a little bit triggered right now. I'm
231020	234520	recording some videos ahead of time because I'm going out of town. And so I've done like
234520	239580	three tonight and I'm at like the end of my rope now. I'm like, Oh God, trans activists
239580	248700	dumps bottles of urine outside UK equality and human rights ministry. What? Oh, just
248700	255420	put them in. That'll do it, right? Just put the urine in. Are you going to dump it on
255420	264100	the guy? Or is that the end of it? Nope. Oh, how much piss are you guys pissing? Oh, you're
264100	272460	just dumping it everywhere. Oh, like this is just stupid. Isn't it? I mean, you're putting
272460	275460	on the sidewalk, so it's not going to matter. You don't have the balls to do it inside or
275460	280860	dump it on the windows or anything, but still this is, this is dumb. Ain't it? The UK equalities
280860	285620	minister or whatever it was, you are literally attacking your own progressive institution.
285620	289220	These people are probably like anarchists or socialists. And so they view this as like,
289220	293140	as like bourgeois progressivism or something. Just another example of the left eating its
293140	298300	own. Oh, there's music in this one. Maybe I'll, maybe I'll mute this one. I don't want
298300	304300	to get nuked off YouTube. Let's see. Buildings destroyed in 2020 Minneapolis riots. Let's
304300	310260	see them. That's the police department. Oh yeah. That was gone. They took out a police
310260	315620	department. I remember Sophia Narwhit saying that. That's a liquor store. I assume that
315620	321900	was like looted to fuck. Yep. That's gone. Of course. Is it still gone? Or has it been
322340	328380	the Denny's or do they get the Denny's? Oh, the Denny's is gone. The building looks fucked.
328380	336020	That's Popeye's right. Burn down the Popeye's. Oh, it's just like, it's just gone. The Perkins
336020	340980	restaurant. Yep. That's just man. They, they, the, the riot literally turned this place
340980	347740	into a ghost town. There's like, wow. With the whole building's gone. Like there's just
347740	352940	nothing left. I think this is going to be the famous like anarchist camp, right? Yep.
352940	357180	Where there's people, there's power. Yeah. Whose lives did they actually make better?
357180	360900	Who did they help? It seems like these riots ultimately just made things worse for the
360900	364300	people living in these neighborhoods. You know, these stores are gone. These restaurants
364300	367340	are gone. Where are they getting their stuff? It's the same thing with all like the, the
367340	372140	shoplifting and all the looting videos that we've seen on TikTok Tuesday in the past.
372140	375020	You know, eventually these Walmarts or whatever, they just shut down. They're not going to
375020	379180	keep restocking just so you can go in there and steal everything, you know, and that destroys
379180	383100	your community. Like where are you going to be able to get your stuff? It's, it's ultimately
383100	390820	self-defeating the way these people behave.
390820	407100	This is the alpha guys. You know why this person owns the night? You want to know why?
407100	413420	All day breakfast, baby. You head over at like 2 AM. You got to get some of those breakfast
413420	420420	sandwiches, get some flapjacks. Oh yeah. I'm just wondering what the heck is in our
420420	429580	water supply? What the heck is in our oxygen supply of the metallic oxide salts that create
429580	440740	a rainbow effect in a sprinkler? What? It's just light refracting. It's just like going
440740	470420	through water. Yeah. Why not? Yes, it was. Ooh. Oh. It is a nation. It is a nation. It
470420	477100	is a nation. What's in the water? You're drinking lady. So for most of this video,
477100	481840	I thought it was just like some schizoid, right? But as soon as she said we as a nation,
481840	485860	now I'm thinking it might be like, like a right-oid, you know, someone who's like extremely
485860	490460	anti-LGBT, you know, very plugged into the whole pride discourse. Maybe they just like
490460	493940	scrolling on tech talk. They see all this nonsense and they're like, Oh my God, the
493940	498100	government hates the straight so much that they're putting rainbows in the air to turn
498100	503820	people gay. What would you want his income to be? Oh God hit me with that doomer shit.
503820	512580	Oh my God, lady. These, these bitches don't know anything about money. What? That's like
512580	519040	less, that's like less than 1% of the entire fucking... 150 maybe to 250,000 a year. Most
519040	523540	people make like $37,000 a year or something. I was just having this conversation with my
523540	531060	friend. Yeah. It was like, you have to manifest a husband, girl. My husband needs to be looking
531060	537340	like 600,000. Holy fuck. You said you want 500k, but what do you think the median income is? What's
537340	547620	the median? What's the median? 60k? 70k? It is $45,000. 45, yeah. OMG. I think it's 250,000. Are
547620	555660	you fucking for real? What? No, it's not. Are you fucking for real? Are you bitches for real?
555660	560460	Holy shit. Like, like, okay, this can't be the average one. These have to be like some entitled
560460	566380	fucking LA, New York, Miami bitches. All right. These gotta be girls who are like used to just
566380	571860	money being thrown around constantly. No, no idea what it means to actually work. I refuse to believe
571860	576740	this is the average woman. No, I I'm, I will not take the black pill today. I refuse. Okay. Maybe
576780	580100	everyone but me knew this, but I just learned from the book I'm reading. I'll put it right here.
580100	586780	Okay. That the three meals a day thing. Wait a second. Refusing compulsory sexuality, a black
586780	593860	asexual lens on our sex obsessed culture. This looks more like a slideshow slide than a book.
593860	598140	I wonder if this is a real thing or if it's just like one of those, like only only online books.
598140	602380	Let's just start over real quick though. Okay. Maybe everyone but me knew this, but I just
602380	605940	learned from the book I'm reading. I'll put it right here. That the three meals a day thing,
606020	611220	breakfast, lunch, and dinner is from colonialism. Of course. Of course it is. When the European
611220	615620	colonizers came and saw the indigenous people eating when they were hungry, they were like,
615620	621940	they're savages. They are uncivilized because the white Europeans differentiated themselves from
621940	628100	animals who would graze for their food when they were hungry by setting distinct meal times that
628100	633700	correlated with time of day. I'm not sure it's quite so simple. That is why we eat three meals
633700	639460	a day instead of just eating when we're hungry. Oh fuck dude. I've been getting in touch with my
639460	645620	Aboriginal side this whole time. Fellas, is it white supremacy to not just overly stuff yourselves
645620	650020	and get mega fat? Actually considering obesity rates and race in the United States, maybe it is.
650020	653700	I don't fucking know. But like, this is obviously stupid, right? You know, everything that the
653700	658740	modern world does is white supremacy or is colonialism or some nonsense. And it's like,
658740	663780	no, sometimes people just do things because that way is better than doing other things.
664420	669540	Okay, so this is gonna go mad, but the harsh reality is that trans women are actually
669540	674340	biologically women. No, no, it's like super shocking, but the most important sex determining
674340	678100	organ in your body. It's actually your brain. And there's a lot of
680340	686740	Sorry, dude, but you're not you're not female are very much in alignment with gender identity.
686740	693060	I know shocker. What is this music? Fuck tries to tell you Oh, sex and gender sex and gender. It's
693060	697300	so different. The truth is, it's a lot more complicated than that. And anybody who tries
697300	703220	to call trans women biological males are coping. Nope, you're coping, seething and dilating over
703220	708980	there. Nice argument. But I've depicted myself as the Chad and you as the whoa jack. No, dude, no,
708980	714340	I've gone over this many times before on channel on social media, we're all over the place, right?
714340	720820	Sex is the trait that determines what gametes you produce, because trans women produce either small
720820	726900	gametes, making them males, or no gametes, making them eunuchs. They never produce large gametes,
726900	732420	therefore they are never females. That's how it is. Sorry, between this clip and the one earlier
732420	736820	about the student who couldn't use biological woman in her project early does feel like the
736820	740580	next wave of trans activism is declaring how there's just no difference between a trans
740580	745140	woman and a cis woman. Considering how many L's trans activism has taken recently, you think now
745140	748660	is the time to moderate your position and come to an agreement rather than radicalize further. But
748660	754340	hey, what do I know? Alright guys, TikTok time is over. I hope you haven't lost the will to live yet.
755300	759780	Just remember, the internet is not real life. Most of the things you see are curated and presented
759780	764900	to you for you to be outraged. Don't worry, people out there in the real world, in meat space as they
764900	769620	called it back in the early 90s, they're not like any of the stuff you've seen today. It's generally
769620	773380	alright out there, okay? I will see you guys next time. I love you.
