00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,280
Hello, my friends. Welcome to TikTok Tuesday. No waiting, no nonsense. Let's jump right

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,280
into it.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,400
Oh, it's a fight at the cafe. Transphobic.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:29,760
Oh, is the trans person working there? I think so.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:38,000
Hi, get out. You are trespassing now. You are trespassing. Get out. Get out. You are

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
trespassing.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,320
Apparently you are trespassing. Since something sounds phobic.

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,880
Did you? Oh shit, she attacked her. Oh. That's beyond the pale now.

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,920
You want to leave me the phone. You want to leave me the phone. Let go of me. I've got

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,920
plenty of witnesses.

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,240
Nope. Listen, you don't get the phone. Even if they called you a slur, you don't get their

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,000
phone, dude. Or sorry, dudette.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Man, Karen's versus Tranny's. Whoever wins, we lose. This is one of those cases where

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,240
you can't really tell like who actually started it, who's in the right, who's in the wrong.

15
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,440
What I do know is that as the employee of the establishment, the trans person seems

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,680
to be in the right to just kick them out. They can do that. They're an employee. They

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,400
work there. The customer doesn't have a unilateral right to be there. They are guests and they

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,760
can be kicked out at any time. However, the trans person basically loses the encounter

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,200
the minute that she decides to attack the cameraman.

20
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,880
You got to remember that even if you might be right in one case, you can't let your moral

21
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,160
righteousness destroy your position.

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:46,160
Looks like an airport. Whoa. Dude, dude. Airports. You don't want to screw around in an airport.

23
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:57,160
You put on a no-fly list. What are they doing? What warrants this reaction? Oh, the fight's

24
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:15,360
breaking out. Yeah, this is a fast track to put on a federal list, guys. Come on. My God.

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,160
What happened? Was there flight delayed or something? Whatever it was, it can't be worth

26
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,240
getting banned from flying for life. Jeez, you guys got to think ahead to the future,

27
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,520
not just, you know, get mad in the moment.

28
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,760
I got a zero on a project proposal in my class because I use the term biological women, which

29
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,720
is apparently not allowed anymore. She even said it was a good project proposal.

30
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,000
Hold on, hold on. I got to pause this and read this. Olivia, this is a solid proposal.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,100
However, the terms biological women are exclusionary and are not allowed in this course as they

32
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:53,220
further reinforce heteronormativity. Is this like a biology class? I mean, it's bad anywhere,

33
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,140
but it's especially bad in biology class.

34
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,380
And I 100% know that this is like the most biased grade ever because my project is about

35
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,700
transgenders competing in biological women's sports. How am I supposed to do my final project

36
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,020
if I can't use the word biological women? But that's what my project is about.

37
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:15,140
I wonder if she used the term cis woman, since that is the accepted progressive speak

38
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,500
for this sort of thing. If she did trans women, cis women and compared them as two different

39
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,460
classes, or would that be like implying that trans women are somehow different from cis

40
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:29,920
women, even though they are, right? But there is like a push in the very fringe of the activist

41
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,140
ideology to erase all differences between trans and cis women. That's why you just call

42
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,820
them all women. And it's like, well, I mean, some men have penises and it's like, well,

43
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,740
is there a difference between the women who have penises and the women who don't? No,

44
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,120
you bigot. So I don't know. Like she probably could have avoided this, but it's still fucking

45
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,700
retarded isn't it? Like you should be able to say biological women because that's what

46
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,020
they are. I gotta be honest, I'm actually like a little bit triggered right now. I'm

47
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,520
recording some videos ahead of time because I'm going out of town. And so I've done like

48
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,580
three tonight and I'm at like the end of my rope now. I'm like, Oh God, trans activists

49
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:08,700
dumps bottles of urine outside UK equality and human rights ministry. What? Oh, just

50
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:15,420
put them in. That'll do it, right? Just put the urine in. Are you going to dump it on

51
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:24,100
the guy? Or is that the end of it? Nope. Oh, how much piss are you guys pissing? Oh, you're

52
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:32,460
just dumping it everywhere. Oh, like this is just stupid. Isn't it? I mean, you're putting

53
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,460
on the sidewalk, so it's not going to matter. You don't have the balls to do it inside or

54
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,860
dump it on the windows or anything, but still this is, this is dumb. Ain't it? The UK equalities

55
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,620
minister or whatever it was, you are literally attacking your own progressive institution.

56
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,220
These people are probably like anarchists or socialists. And so they view this as like,

57
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,140
as like bourgeois progressivism or something. Just another example of the left eating its

58
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,300
own. Oh, there's music in this one. Maybe I'll, maybe I'll mute this one. I don't want

59
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:04,300
to get nuked off YouTube. Let's see. Buildings destroyed in 2020 Minneapolis riots. Let's

60
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,260
see them. That's the police department. Oh yeah. That was gone. They took out a police

61
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,620
department. I remember Sophia Narwhit saying that. That's a liquor store. I assume that

62
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,900
was like looted to fuck. Yep. That's gone. Of course. Is it still gone? Or has it been

63
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:28,380
the Denny's or do they get the Denny's? Oh, the Denny's is gone. The building looks fucked.

64
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:36,020
That's Popeye's right. Burn down the Popeye's. Oh, it's just like, it's just gone. The Perkins

65
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,980
restaurant. Yep. That's just man. They, they, the, the riot literally turned this place

66
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:47,740
into a ghost town. There's like, wow. With the whole building's gone. Like there's just

67
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,940
nothing left. I think this is going to be the famous like anarchist camp, right? Yep.

68
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,180
Where there's people, there's power. Yeah. Whose lives did they actually make better?

69
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,900
Who did they help? It seems like these riots ultimately just made things worse for the

70
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,300
people living in these neighborhoods. You know, these stores are gone. These restaurants

71
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,340
are gone. Where are they getting their stuff? It's the same thing with all like the, the

72
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,140
shoplifting and all the looting videos that we've seen on TikTok Tuesday in the past.

73
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,020
You know, eventually these Walmarts or whatever, they just shut down. They're not going to

74
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,180
keep restocking just so you can go in there and steal everything, you know, and that destroys

75
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,100
your community. Like where are you going to be able to get your stuff? It's, it's ultimately

76
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:30,820
self-defeating the way these people behave.

77
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:47,100
This is the alpha guys. You know why this person owns the night? You want to know why?

78
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:53,420
All day breakfast, baby. You head over at like 2 AM. You got to get some of those breakfast

79
00:06:53,420 --> 00:07:00,420
sandwiches, get some flapjacks. Oh yeah. I'm just wondering what the heck is in our

80
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:09,580
water supply? What the heck is in our oxygen supply of the metallic oxide salts that create

81
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:20,740
a rainbow effect in a sprinkler? What? It's just light refracting. It's just like going

82
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:50,420
through water. Yeah. Why not? Yes, it was. Ooh. Oh. It is a nation. It is a nation. It

83
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:57,100
is a nation. What's in the water? You're drinking lady. So for most of this video,

84
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,840
I thought it was just like some schizoid, right? But as soon as she said we as a nation,

85
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,860
now I'm thinking it might be like, like a right-oid, you know, someone who's like extremely

86
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,460
anti-LGBT, you know, very plugged into the whole pride discourse. Maybe they just like

87
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,940
scrolling on tech talk. They see all this nonsense and they're like, Oh my God, the

88
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,100
government hates the straight so much that they're putting rainbows in the air to turn

89
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,820
people gay. What would you want his income to be? Oh God hit me with that doomer shit.

90
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:32,580
Oh my God, lady. These, these bitches don't know anything about money. What? That's like

91
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:39,040
less, that's like less than 1% of the entire fucking... 150 maybe to 250,000 a year. Most

92
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,540
people make like $37,000 a year or something. I was just having this conversation with my

93
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:51,060
friend. Yeah. It was like, you have to manifest a husband, girl. My husband needs to be looking

94
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:57,340
like 600,000. Holy fuck. You said you want 500k, but what do you think the median income is? What's

95
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:07,620
the median? What's the median? 60k? 70k? It is $45,000. 45, yeah. OMG. I think it's 250,000. Are

96
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:15,660
you fucking for real? What? No, it's not. Are you fucking for real? Are you bitches for real?

97
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,460
Holy shit. Like, like, okay, this can't be the average one. These have to be like some entitled

98
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:26,380
fucking LA, New York, Miami bitches. All right. These gotta be girls who are like used to just

99
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,860
money being thrown around constantly. No, no idea what it means to actually work. I refuse to believe

100
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,740
this is the average woman. No, I I'm, I will not take the black pill today. I refuse. Okay. Maybe

101
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,100
everyone but me knew this, but I just learned from the book I'm reading. I'll put it right here.

102
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:46,780
Okay. That the three meals a day thing. Wait a second. Refusing compulsory sexuality, a black

103
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:53,860
asexual lens on our sex obsessed culture. This looks more like a slideshow slide than a book.

104
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,140
I wonder if this is a real thing or if it's just like one of those, like only only online books.

105
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,380
Let's just start over real quick though. Okay. Maybe everyone but me knew this, but I just

106
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,940
learned from the book I'm reading. I'll put it right here. That the three meals a day thing,

107
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:11,220
breakfast, lunch, and dinner is from colonialism. Of course. Of course it is. When the European

108
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,620
colonizers came and saw the indigenous people eating when they were hungry, they were like,

109
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:21,940
they're savages. They are uncivilized because the white Europeans differentiated themselves from

110
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:28,100
animals who would graze for their food when they were hungry by setting distinct meal times that

111
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,700
correlated with time of day. I'm not sure it's quite so simple. That is why we eat three meals

112
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:39,460
a day instead of just eating when we're hungry. Oh fuck dude. I've been getting in touch with my

113
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:45,620
Aboriginal side this whole time. Fellas, is it white supremacy to not just overly stuff yourselves

114
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,020
and get mega fat? Actually considering obesity rates and race in the United States, maybe it is.

115
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,700
I don't fucking know. But like, this is obviously stupid, right? You know, everything that the

116
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,740
modern world does is white supremacy or is colonialism or some nonsense. And it's like,

117
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,780
no, sometimes people just do things because that way is better than doing other things.

118
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,540
Okay, so this is gonna go mad, but the harsh reality is that trans women are actually

119
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,340
biologically women. No, no, it's like super shocking, but the most important sex determining

120
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,100
organ in your body. It's actually your brain. And there's a lot of

121
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:26,740
Sorry, dude, but you're not you're not female are very much in alignment with gender identity.

122
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:33,060
I know shocker. What is this music? Fuck tries to tell you Oh, sex and gender sex and gender. It's

123
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,300
so different. The truth is, it's a lot more complicated than that. And anybody who tries

124
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:43,220
to call trans women biological males are coping. Nope, you're coping, seething and dilating over

125
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,980
there. Nice argument. But I've depicted myself as the Chad and you as the whoa jack. No, dude, no,

126
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,340
I've gone over this many times before on channel on social media, we're all over the place, right?

127
00:11:54,340 --> 00:12:00,820
Sex is the trait that determines what gametes you produce, because trans women produce either small

128
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:06,900
gametes, making them males, or no gametes, making them eunuchs. They never produce large gametes,

129
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:12,420
therefore they are never females. That's how it is. Sorry, between this clip and the one earlier

130
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,820
about the student who couldn't use biological woman in her project early does feel like the

131
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,580
next wave of trans activism is declaring how there's just no difference between a trans

132
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:25,140
woman and a cis woman. Considering how many L's trans activism has taken recently, you think now

133
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,660
is the time to moderate your position and come to an agreement rather than radicalize further. But

134
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:34,340
hey, what do I know? Alright guys, TikTok time is over. I hope you haven't lost the will to live yet.

135
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,780
Just remember, the internet is not real life. Most of the things you see are curated and presented

136
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:44,900
to you for you to be outraged. Don't worry, people out there in the real world, in meat space as they

137
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,620
called it back in the early 90s, they're not like any of the stuff you've seen today. It's generally

138
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,380
alright out there, okay? I will see you guys next time. I love you.
