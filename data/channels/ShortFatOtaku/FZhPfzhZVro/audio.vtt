00:00.000 --> 00:11.280
Hello, my friends. Welcome to TikTok Tuesday. No waiting, no nonsense. Let's jump right

00:11.280 --> 00:12.280
into it.

00:12.280 --> 00:16.400
Oh, it's a fight at the cafe. Transphobic.

00:16.400 --> 00:29.760
Oh, is the trans person working there? I think so.

00:29.760 --> 00:38.000
Hi, get out. You are trespassing now. You are trespassing. Get out. Get out. You are

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
trespassing.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.320
Apparently you are trespassing. Since something sounds phobic.

00:42.320 --> 00:48.880
Did you? Oh shit, she attacked her. Oh. That's beyond the pale now.

00:48.880 --> 00:52.920
You want to leave me the phone. You want to leave me the phone. Let go of me. I've got

00:52.920 --> 00:53.920
plenty of witnesses.

00:53.920 --> 00:58.240
Nope. Listen, you don't get the phone. Even if they called you a slur, you don't get their

00:58.240 --> 01:01.000
phone, dude. Or sorry, dudette.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
Man, Karen's versus Tranny's. Whoever wins, we lose. This is one of those cases where

01:06.000 --> 01:09.240
you can't really tell like who actually started it, who's in the right, who's in the wrong.

01:09.240 --> 01:13.440
What I do know is that as the employee of the establishment, the trans person seems

01:13.440 --> 01:16.680
to be in the right to just kick them out. They can do that. They're an employee. They

01:16.680 --> 01:20.400
work there. The customer doesn't have a unilateral right to be there. They are guests and they

01:20.400 --> 01:25.760
can be kicked out at any time. However, the trans person basically loses the encounter

01:25.760 --> 01:28.200
the minute that she decides to attack the cameraman.

01:28.200 --> 01:31.880
You got to remember that even if you might be right in one case, you can't let your moral

01:31.880 --> 01:34.160
righteousness destroy your position.

01:34.160 --> 01:46.160
Looks like an airport. Whoa. Dude, dude. Airports. You don't want to screw around in an airport.

01:46.160 --> 01:57.160
You put on a no-fly list. What are they doing? What warrants this reaction? Oh, the fight's

01:57.160 --> 02:15.360
breaking out. Yeah, this is a fast track to put on a federal list, guys. Come on. My God.

02:15.360 --> 02:19.160
What happened? Was there flight delayed or something? Whatever it was, it can't be worth

02:19.160 --> 02:23.240
getting banned from flying for life. Jeez, you guys got to think ahead to the future,

02:23.240 --> 02:25.520
not just, you know, get mad in the moment.

02:25.520 --> 02:30.760
I got a zero on a project proposal in my class because I use the term biological women, which

02:30.760 --> 02:34.720
is apparently not allowed anymore. She even said it was a good project proposal.

02:34.720 --> 02:39.000
Hold on, hold on. I got to pause this and read this. Olivia, this is a solid proposal.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.100
However, the terms biological women are exclusionary and are not allowed in this course as they

02:43.100 --> 02:53.220
further reinforce heteronormativity. Is this like a biology class? I mean, it's bad anywhere,

02:53.220 --> 02:55.140
but it's especially bad in biology class.

02:55.140 --> 03:00.380
And I 100% know that this is like the most biased grade ever because my project is about

03:00.380 --> 03:05.700
transgenders competing in biological women's sports. How am I supposed to do my final project

03:05.700 --> 03:10.020
if I can't use the word biological women? But that's what my project is about.

03:10.020 --> 03:15.140
I wonder if she used the term cis woman, since that is the accepted progressive speak

03:15.140 --> 03:18.500
for this sort of thing. If she did trans women, cis women and compared them as two different

03:18.500 --> 03:23.460
classes, or would that be like implying that trans women are somehow different from cis

03:23.460 --> 03:29.920
women, even though they are, right? But there is like a push in the very fringe of the activist

03:29.920 --> 03:34.140
ideology to erase all differences between trans and cis women. That's why you just call

03:34.140 --> 03:37.820
them all women. And it's like, well, I mean, some men have penises and it's like, well,

03:37.820 --> 03:40.740
is there a difference between the women who have penises and the women who don't? No,

03:40.740 --> 03:45.120
you bigot. So I don't know. Like she probably could have avoided this, but it's still fucking

03:45.120 --> 03:47.700
retarded isn't it? Like you should be able to say biological women because that's what

03:47.700 --> 03:51.020
they are. I gotta be honest, I'm actually like a little bit triggered right now. I'm

03:51.020 --> 03:54.520
recording some videos ahead of time because I'm going out of town. And so I've done like

03:54.520 --> 03:59.580
three tonight and I'm at like the end of my rope now. I'm like, Oh God, trans activists

03:59.580 --> 04:08.700
dumps bottles of urine outside UK equality and human rights ministry. What? Oh, just

04:08.700 --> 04:15.420
put them in. That'll do it, right? Just put the urine in. Are you going to dump it on

04:15.420 --> 04:24.100
the guy? Or is that the end of it? Nope. Oh, how much piss are you guys pissing? Oh, you're

04:24.100 --> 04:32.460
just dumping it everywhere. Oh, like this is just stupid. Isn't it? I mean, you're putting

04:32.460 --> 04:35.460
on the sidewalk, so it's not going to matter. You don't have the balls to do it inside or

04:35.460 --> 04:40.860
dump it on the windows or anything, but still this is, this is dumb. Ain't it? The UK equalities

04:40.860 --> 04:45.620
minister or whatever it was, you are literally attacking your own progressive institution.

04:45.620 --> 04:49.220
These people are probably like anarchists or socialists. And so they view this as like,

04:49.220 --> 04:53.140
as like bourgeois progressivism or something. Just another example of the left eating its

04:53.140 --> 04:58.300
own. Oh, there's music in this one. Maybe I'll, maybe I'll mute this one. I don't want

04:58.300 --> 05:04.300
to get nuked off YouTube. Let's see. Buildings destroyed in 2020 Minneapolis riots. Let's

05:04.300 --> 05:10.260
see them. That's the police department. Oh yeah. That was gone. They took out a police

05:10.260 --> 05:15.620
department. I remember Sophia Narwhit saying that. That's a liquor store. I assume that

05:15.620 --> 05:21.900
was like looted to fuck. Yep. That's gone. Of course. Is it still gone? Or has it been

05:22.340 --> 05:28.380
the Denny's or do they get the Denny's? Oh, the Denny's is gone. The building looks fucked.

05:28.380 --> 05:36.020
That's Popeye's right. Burn down the Popeye's. Oh, it's just like, it's just gone. The Perkins

05:36.020 --> 05:40.980
restaurant. Yep. That's just man. They, they, the, the riot literally turned this place

05:40.980 --> 05:47.740
into a ghost town. There's like, wow. With the whole building's gone. Like there's just

05:47.740 --> 05:52.940
nothing left. I think this is going to be the famous like anarchist camp, right? Yep.

05:52.940 --> 05:57.180
Where there's people, there's power. Yeah. Whose lives did they actually make better?

05:57.180 --> 06:00.900
Who did they help? It seems like these riots ultimately just made things worse for the

06:00.900 --> 06:04.300
people living in these neighborhoods. You know, these stores are gone. These restaurants

06:04.300 --> 06:07.340
are gone. Where are they getting their stuff? It's the same thing with all like the, the

06:07.340 --> 06:12.140
shoplifting and all the looting videos that we've seen on TikTok Tuesday in the past.

06:12.140 --> 06:15.020
You know, eventually these Walmarts or whatever, they just shut down. They're not going to

06:15.020 --> 06:19.180
keep restocking just so you can go in there and steal everything, you know, and that destroys

06:19.180 --> 06:23.100
your community. Like where are you going to be able to get your stuff? It's, it's ultimately

06:23.100 --> 06:30.820
self-defeating the way these people behave.

06:30.820 --> 06:47.100
This is the alpha guys. You know why this person owns the night? You want to know why?

06:47.100 --> 06:53.420
All day breakfast, baby. You head over at like 2 AM. You got to get some of those breakfast

06:53.420 --> 07:00.420
sandwiches, get some flapjacks. Oh yeah. I'm just wondering what the heck is in our

07:00.420 --> 07:09.580
water supply? What the heck is in our oxygen supply of the metallic oxide salts that create

07:09.580 --> 07:20.740
a rainbow effect in a sprinkler? What? It's just light refracting. It's just like going

07:20.740 --> 07:50.420
through water. Yeah. Why not? Yes, it was. Ooh. Oh. It is a nation. It is a nation. It

07:50.420 --> 07:57.100
is a nation. What's in the water? You're drinking lady. So for most of this video,

07:57.100 --> 08:01.840
I thought it was just like some schizoid, right? But as soon as she said we as a nation,

08:01.840 --> 08:05.860
now I'm thinking it might be like, like a right-oid, you know, someone who's like extremely

08:05.860 --> 08:10.460
anti-LGBT, you know, very plugged into the whole pride discourse. Maybe they just like

08:10.460 --> 08:13.940
scrolling on tech talk. They see all this nonsense and they're like, Oh my God, the

08:13.940 --> 08:18.100
government hates the straight so much that they're putting rainbows in the air to turn

08:18.100 --> 08:23.820
people gay. What would you want his income to be? Oh God hit me with that doomer shit.

08:23.820 --> 08:32.580
Oh my God, lady. These, these bitches don't know anything about money. What? That's like

08:32.580 --> 08:39.040
less, that's like less than 1% of the entire fucking... 150 maybe to 250,000 a year. Most

08:39.040 --> 08:43.540
people make like $37,000 a year or something. I was just having this conversation with my

08:43.540 --> 08:51.060
friend. Yeah. It was like, you have to manifest a husband, girl. My husband needs to be looking

08:51.060 --> 08:57.340
like 600,000. Holy fuck. You said you want 500k, but what do you think the median income is? What's

08:57.340 --> 09:07.620
the median? What's the median? 60k? 70k? It is $45,000. 45, yeah. OMG. I think it's 250,000. Are

09:07.620 --> 09:15.660
you fucking for real? What? No, it's not. Are you fucking for real? Are you bitches for real?

09:15.660 --> 09:20.460
Holy shit. Like, like, okay, this can't be the average one. These have to be like some entitled

09:20.460 --> 09:26.380
fucking LA, New York, Miami bitches. All right. These gotta be girls who are like used to just

09:26.380 --> 09:31.860
money being thrown around constantly. No, no idea what it means to actually work. I refuse to believe

09:31.860 --> 09:36.740
this is the average woman. No, I I'm, I will not take the black pill today. I refuse. Okay. Maybe

09:36.780 --> 09:40.100
everyone but me knew this, but I just learned from the book I'm reading. I'll put it right here.

09:40.100 --> 09:46.780
Okay. That the three meals a day thing. Wait a second. Refusing compulsory sexuality, a black

09:46.780 --> 09:53.860
asexual lens on our sex obsessed culture. This looks more like a slideshow slide than a book.

09:53.860 --> 09:58.140
I wonder if this is a real thing or if it's just like one of those, like only only online books.

09:58.140 --> 10:02.380
Let's just start over real quick though. Okay. Maybe everyone but me knew this, but I just

10:02.380 --> 10:05.940
learned from the book I'm reading. I'll put it right here. That the three meals a day thing,

10:06.020 --> 10:11.220
breakfast, lunch, and dinner is from colonialism. Of course. Of course it is. When the European

10:11.220 --> 10:15.620
colonizers came and saw the indigenous people eating when they were hungry, they were like,

10:15.620 --> 10:21.940
they're savages. They are uncivilized because the white Europeans differentiated themselves from

10:21.940 --> 10:28.100
animals who would graze for their food when they were hungry by setting distinct meal times that

10:28.100 --> 10:33.700
correlated with time of day. I'm not sure it's quite so simple. That is why we eat three meals

10:33.700 --> 10:39.460
a day instead of just eating when we're hungry. Oh fuck dude. I've been getting in touch with my

10:39.460 --> 10:45.620
Aboriginal side this whole time. Fellas, is it white supremacy to not just overly stuff yourselves

10:45.620 --> 10:50.020
and get mega fat? Actually considering obesity rates and race in the United States, maybe it is.

10:50.020 --> 10:53.700
I don't fucking know. But like, this is obviously stupid, right? You know, everything that the

10:53.700 --> 10:58.740
modern world does is white supremacy or is colonialism or some nonsense. And it's like,

10:58.740 --> 11:03.780
no, sometimes people just do things because that way is better than doing other things.

11:04.420 --> 11:09.540
Okay, so this is gonna go mad, but the harsh reality is that trans women are actually

11:09.540 --> 11:14.340
biologically women. No, no, it's like super shocking, but the most important sex determining

11:14.340 --> 11:18.100
organ in your body. It's actually your brain. And there's a lot of

11:20.340 --> 11:26.740
Sorry, dude, but you're not you're not female are very much in alignment with gender identity.

11:26.740 --> 11:33.060
I know shocker. What is this music? Fuck tries to tell you Oh, sex and gender sex and gender. It's

11:33.060 --> 11:37.300
so different. The truth is, it's a lot more complicated than that. And anybody who tries

11:37.300 --> 11:43.220
to call trans women biological males are coping. Nope, you're coping, seething and dilating over

11:43.220 --> 11:48.980
there. Nice argument. But I've depicted myself as the Chad and you as the whoa jack. No, dude, no,

11:48.980 --> 11:54.340
I've gone over this many times before on channel on social media, we're all over the place, right?

11:54.340 --> 12:00.820
Sex is the trait that determines what gametes you produce, because trans women produce either small

12:00.820 --> 12:06.900
gametes, making them males, or no gametes, making them eunuchs. They never produce large gametes,

12:06.900 --> 12:12.420
therefore they are never females. That's how it is. Sorry, between this clip and the one earlier

12:12.420 --> 12:16.820
about the student who couldn't use biological woman in her project early does feel like the

12:16.820 --> 12:20.580
next wave of trans activism is declaring how there's just no difference between a trans

12:20.580 --> 12:25.140
woman and a cis woman. Considering how many L's trans activism has taken recently, you think now

12:25.140 --> 12:28.660
is the time to moderate your position and come to an agreement rather than radicalize further. But

12:28.660 --> 12:34.340
hey, what do I know? Alright guys, TikTok time is over. I hope you haven't lost the will to live yet.

12:35.300 --> 12:39.780
Just remember, the internet is not real life. Most of the things you see are curated and presented

12:39.780 --> 12:44.900
to you for you to be outraged. Don't worry, people out there in the real world, in meat space as they

12:44.900 --> 12:49.620
called it back in the early 90s, they're not like any of the stuff you've seen today. It's generally

12:49.620 --> 12:53.380
alright out there, okay? I will see you guys next time. I love you.
