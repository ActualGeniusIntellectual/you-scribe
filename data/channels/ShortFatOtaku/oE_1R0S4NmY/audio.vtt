00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
Hello, welcome to SJ Weekly. No coffee slurps this time because I don't have any coffee.

00:04.880 --> 00:10.320
Instead, I have chocolate-coated roasted coffee beans. Check this out.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.880
They're really crunchy and I feel like they're loaded with caffeine.

00:18.880 --> 00:24.080
Let's start with, a college student was told to remove a fuck nazis sign because it wasn't

00:24.080 --> 00:28.560
inclusive. This email tells me the university cares more about the feelings of nazis and the

00:28.560 --> 00:33.200
safety of their students. Well, let's be honest, this is the endpoint of identity politics.

00:33.200 --> 00:38.400
If you can racialize a non-racial group like, say, Muslims, they're very clearly a religion,

00:38.400 --> 00:43.920
not a race, and the process of racializing them is to collectivize them together through shared

00:43.920 --> 00:50.160
beliefs and values and behaviors, and then consider them outsiders within the main society,

00:50.160 --> 00:56.640
you can obviously also do that to nazis, which basically makes nazis a minority race. So I'm not

00:56.640 --> 01:01.040
surprised that the university did this. Nicole Parson said she was fed up with her university's

01:01.040 --> 01:06.000
silence over a string of hate crimes on campus when she put up a sign in her dorm window that

01:06.000 --> 01:11.600
read, fuck nazis, you are not welcome here. I wonder what these hate crimes on campus were.

01:12.880 --> 01:17.520
Were they somebody posting flyers that say something like, you know, it's okay to be

01:17.520 --> 01:22.800
white or something nonsensical like that? Very clearly not a hate crime. In my opinion,

01:22.800 --> 01:29.280
she should be allowed to leave this up. In fact, it's obviously regressive SJW bullshit,

01:29.280 --> 01:34.160
but it's her dorm. It's her freedom of speech. She shouldn't have to take it down.

01:34.160 --> 01:38.400
A week after posting the sign in her dorm window, she received an email from a resident director

01:38.400 --> 01:42.880
asking her to remove the sign over issues of inclusion. The email says I'm one of the

01:42.880 --> 01:47.840
residence directors at UMass Amherst and currently the RD on call for East Side. I'm emailing you

01:47.840 --> 01:52.240
today in regards to a phone call I've received concerning a sign that is placed in your window.

01:52.240 --> 01:55.840
From this conversation, it appears to be that the sign mentioned can be paraphrased

01:55.840 --> 02:00.080
as nazis are not welcome here. Though the sign is permitted under freedom of speech,

02:00.080 --> 02:04.000
I would also like to discuss the impact on the community that the sign has had.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.360
There are some in the community who have expressed that the sign should be taken down

02:07.360 --> 02:12.080
as it has created mixed emotions in the community on how to proceed, issues of inclusion,

02:12.080 --> 02:16.080
and the ability to be active members of their community. While residence education cannot

02:16.080 --> 02:20.320
force you or your roommate to take the sign down, I am asking that you or your roommate take the

02:20.320 --> 02:24.320
sign down so that all students can be part of an inclusive residential experience as well as

02:24.320 --> 02:29.280
having a respectful environment to be a part of here on campus. So as it turns out, she's not

02:29.280 --> 02:34.400
even being forced to take it down. It's just that somebody complained and then these people,

02:34.400 --> 02:38.160
being the cucks that they are, are saying that, oh, somebody feels bad about this,

02:38.160 --> 02:43.360
so can you please take it down? No, you know what? She should leave it up. She's probably stupid,

02:43.360 --> 02:47.840
and the reason she put up the sign is also probably stupid, but it's her right and she

02:47.840 --> 02:52.480
should leave it up. I was in absolute shock. This email tells me that university cares more about

02:52.480 --> 02:55.680
the feelings of Nazis and the safety of their students. You know what? The university shouldn't

02:55.680 --> 02:59.920
care about either of those things. The university should care about providing an education. If

02:59.920 --> 03:04.080
people want to have political disagreements and exchange points of view, that's their business.

03:04.080 --> 03:07.360
As long as it doesn't become violent, the university should not be stepping in.

03:07.360 --> 03:11.760
Here's a great tweet from Bro Team Pill. I've always respected this guy's stuff.

03:11.760 --> 03:16.640
Gamers, important warning, do not bring your meme shit to class or to anywhere.

03:41.760 --> 03:52.000
Wow, I gotta say, the students going to school now seem to be fucking cucks as well.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.640
There are obvious issues with Diablo Immortal. I did a video talking about it earlier,

03:56.640 --> 04:00.560
but I guess they just found it offensive, so they had to talk about it at school or something,

04:00.560 --> 04:05.360
which is just surreal. When I was in high school, talking about video game stuff at school would

04:05.360 --> 04:10.000
mean that the teacher would tell us to shut up. Main Teen says struggles with gender identity

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
led to brutal stabbing deaths of parents and pet dog. Jesus Christ. Andrea Balser has been

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
sentenced to 40 years after admitting to killing her parents in October 2016.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.360
I know there are a lot of people that would just attribute this to the fact that she's trans.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.440
I wouldn't necessarily go that far, though there does seem to be some kind of correlation between

04:31.440 --> 04:36.480
being trans and other mental issues, for obvious reasons. A teenager who said she killed her

04:36.480 --> 04:39.440
parents and the family's pet dog because of struggles with her gender identity has been

04:39.440 --> 04:44.320
sentenced to 40 years in jail. She was 17 at the time when she snapped and fatally stabbed

04:44.320 --> 04:48.880
her parents. That's fucking insane. Balser alleged she was struggling to deal with her

04:48.880 --> 04:53.200
transition from male to female and that her family offered her no support during this time.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.680
She also claimed she was molested for years by her mother and physically and mentally

04:57.680 --> 05:03.600
abused by her father, accusations the rest of the family denied. This is fucked, man.

05:04.560 --> 05:09.920
Assuming that she's telling the truth, and she might be. Families do like to cover this

05:09.920 --> 05:15.680
kind of thing up. Assuming she's telling the truth, she seems to be a victim who has become

05:15.680 --> 05:22.400
a perpetrator. Assuming that she's not, and she just used that as a cover story, it's very clear

05:22.400 --> 05:30.720
that this was somebody who needed help and didn't get it. It's very common for families to not offer

05:30.800 --> 05:36.240
support when people start to transition, and so I'm not surprised that something like this happened.

05:37.040 --> 05:42.000
I'm not trying to excuse it away. Very clearly, she still takes the blame for stabbing people,

05:42.000 --> 05:46.960
no matter what the actual truth is. Her brother told the court that her claims that she did not

05:46.960 --> 05:51.840
receive any support during her transition were an insult to our family, an insult to society,

05:51.840 --> 05:57.120
and an insult to the LGBTQ community. There was no hatred, there was no malice, there was no ill will.

05:57.120 --> 06:02.240
There was resignation, to be sure, but ultimately there was acceptance. To justify these killings

06:02.240 --> 06:06.560
because of sexual identity or gender dysphoria beliefs is a truly cowardly act. Andrea should

06:06.560 --> 06:10.960
be ashamed of herself for it, and the judge did say he did not take her struggles with gender

06:10.960 --> 06:15.440
identity into account when sentencing her. This is just a sad situation all around. I know there's a

06:15.440 --> 06:21.440
meme floating around right now about how trans activists, especially radical trans activists,

06:21.440 --> 06:28.080
claim that anybody who basically is not a radical trans activist, their belief harms and kills

06:28.080 --> 06:33.280
trans people. You know, misgendering them or using the wrong pronouns or whatever. It literally kills

06:33.280 --> 06:38.640
trans people, and the meme is that, well, it turns out that being trans actually kills people. I can

06:38.640 --> 06:42.400
see why you might get a chuckle out of that. There's some dark humor there, but this is just a sad

06:42.400 --> 06:48.560
situation. Y'all, this is real. There is a sexy eagle ad on fur affinity that leads to healthcare.gov.

06:49.440 --> 06:50.880
Are you fucking, are you serious?

06:56.320 --> 06:59.360
You wouldn't bang an eagle without having healthcare insurance?

07:08.480 --> 07:12.720
I, uh, I don't think I'd bang an eagle at all, thank you very much. On the BBC,

07:12.720 --> 07:18.080
girls are more likely to face loneliness. All right. Young women are more likely than

07:18.080 --> 07:21.120
young men to have feelings of loneliness. According to a study from the office for

07:21.120 --> 07:25.200
national statistics, one in 10 young people in the UK often feel lonely.

07:26.240 --> 07:30.480
Is, is this really worth, I can see how it can be worth a study, but is this really worth an

07:30.480 --> 07:34.880
article on? Like everyone feels lonely sometimes, you know, sometimes you want to hang out with

07:34.880 --> 07:39.760
somebody and nobody's available. So you got to spend like an evening by yourself and you go like,

07:39.760 --> 07:43.520
oh, that's kind of lonely. You know, there's a difference between feeling lonely once in a while

07:43.520 --> 07:48.000
and like having no friends. The study found a stigma attached to loneliness with young people

07:48.000 --> 07:54.240
fearing it would be seen as failing. Um, maybe, maybe that's a new thing. I know that I never

07:54.240 --> 07:58.240
felt a stigma attached to loneliness, at least not like short-term loneliness. I think everyone

07:58.240 --> 08:01.280
has nights once in a while where you want to see somebody but can't, and then you're just like,

08:01.280 --> 08:04.800
oh, well, I guess I'm by myself. It doesn't, it doesn't feel like you're failing. It feels like

08:04.800 --> 08:10.480
you're lonely and maybe you're bored. I can see though, if you, you know, can't maintain friendships

08:10.480 --> 08:14.880
or something that it would, it could be seen as failing. I can see that. The, there were young

08:14.880 --> 08:19.280
people who used social media to cover up their feelings and pretend their lives were not lonely.

08:20.240 --> 08:25.760
I can see that too, because social media is just one giant fucking parade where everyone compares

08:25.760 --> 08:29.600
the shitty parts of their own lives to the good parts of other people's lives. It's actually been

08:29.600 --> 08:33.840
a, been a problem for me too. You know, I think everyone has this problem. Like I've, I've logged

08:33.840 --> 08:38.720
in and seen high school and college friends doing some pretty incredible things with their lives,

08:38.720 --> 08:44.080
things that I wish that I'd be doing, but that I'm not. And part of me is like, well, I guess I'm

08:44.080 --> 08:50.000
just a failure. And you know, maybe I am, but part of me also recognizes that those are highlights.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.560
Those aren't the average times of their life. It's the best times of their life. I could post some

08:54.560 --> 08:59.600
pretty remarkable things that I've done. And I'm sure some of them during their lower points would

08:59.600 --> 09:04.400
look at that and also feel the same way. The study from the ONS looks at the extent of loneliness

09:04.400 --> 09:10.720
among people aged between 10 and 24. There were about 11% who often felt lonely and a 34% who

09:10.720 --> 09:15.680
sometimes felt lonely with more girls than boys feeling this way. And this is why the BBC is

09:15.680 --> 09:20.720
talking about it. It's a gendered issue for them. It's a girl's issue. Of course it is. But let's

09:20.720 --> 09:24.960
actually look at that study from the ONS. I have it right here. Children's and young people's

09:24.960 --> 09:30.000
experiences of loneliness 2018. And this is how you can tell that the BBC only read the headlines

09:30.000 --> 09:34.320
of the study and just picked out things that fit with their worldview. You have the headline of

09:34.320 --> 09:38.880
this section in the study, girls report experiencing loneliness slightly more often than boys.

09:38.880 --> 09:43.280
Okay, that's fine. That's what the BBC printed. Here's the actual content. On the loneliness

09:43.280 --> 09:50.080
scale, boys were more likely than girls to score three, the lowest score, with 38.5% of boys and

09:50.080 --> 09:55.520
29.9% of girls scoring in this way respectively. This means that boys were more likely than girls

09:55.520 --> 10:01.520
to say hardly ever or never. What this means is that boys are not lonely more than girls.

10:01.520 --> 10:05.920
But that doesn't necessarily mean that the inverse is true, that girls are actually more lonely than

10:05.920 --> 10:09.520
boys. Girls were more likely to score four, five, and six in the scale, suggesting that

10:09.520 --> 10:13.760
they were more likely than boys to choose the response some of the time. So there are more

10:13.760 --> 10:20.400
girls who are sometimes lonely than boys. However, when asked directly how often they feel lonely,

10:20.400 --> 10:27.920
we found no significant differences between boys and girls. 12.6% of boys reported that they often

10:27.920 --> 10:34.160
felt lonely compared with 10.1% of girls, while over half of boys and half of girls reported

10:34.160 --> 10:38.560
that they hardly ever or never felt lonely. So as it turns out, when it comes to constant

10:38.560 --> 10:44.080
loneliness, there's actually 2% more boys. It's not even that big of a gap, but it's still

10:44.080 --> 10:48.960
ultimately a boy's problem. So the BBC did not actually read the contents of the study.

10:49.760 --> 10:55.680
They just printed what looked good to them. You can see on this graph that on the left side,

10:55.680 --> 11:01.440
there are more boys than girls that don't feel lonely at all. In the middle, there are more girls

11:01.440 --> 11:06.560
than boys that sometimes feel lonely. And then on the right, there are more boys than girls that

11:06.560 --> 11:11.520
always feel lonely. This honestly doesn't surprise me because in general, and in almost every

11:11.520 --> 11:17.920
measurement, men seem to hang out at the extremes more than women on average. This works out across

11:17.920 --> 11:23.920
most metrics, whether we're talking about life success or earnings or average strength or average

11:23.920 --> 11:28.800
intelligence or creativity. I'm not saying that women can't excel at any of these things. They

11:28.800 --> 11:33.600
obviously can, but men are more likely to boom or bust while women are more likely to hang out

11:33.600 --> 11:38.000
around the average. But of course, the BBC doesn't care about any of that kind of nuance. They just

11:38.000 --> 11:42.800
want to print what they want to print. This is an older article, May 15th, 2018. Israel has the

11:42.800 --> 11:47.520
right and obligation to defend its border with deadly force by David French on the National

11:47.520 --> 11:51.440
Review. Israeli border police officers take positions during a Palestinian protest of the

11:51.440 --> 11:55.760
US embassy move to Jerusalem. Would you let people who want to kill you into your home?

11:55.760 --> 12:00.480
One of the enduring mysteries of modern political discourse is the way in which smart people who

12:00.480 --> 12:05.520
are not remotely anti-Semitic impose curious, unworkable double standards on the nation of

12:05.520 --> 12:11.120
Israel. Let's take, for example, the response of many on the left to the so-called Great Return

12:11.120 --> 12:16.240
March, an effort by thousands of Gazans to storm the Israeli border. A nation has the right to

12:16.240 --> 12:20.800
protect its integrity of its border, and that right is supplemented by an inherent right of

12:20.800 --> 12:26.160
self-defense in the face of a hostile foreign power. Yeah, it's all reasonable, isn't it?

12:26.160 --> 12:30.240
This David French guy knows what he's talking about. Oh, here's David French on October 30th,

12:30.240 --> 12:35.520
2018. It's time to calm down about the caravan. What happened to the nation having a right to

12:35.520 --> 12:39.760
protect its border? What happened to the right of self-defense? When Gazans were marching on

12:39.760 --> 12:44.160
Israel, it was a big deal. Honestly, it's hard to think of a response less measured and more

12:44.160 --> 12:48.000
effective at undermining moderate support for immigration restrictions than the reaction of

12:48.080 --> 12:52.160
the president and key allies. The president's tweets have conveyed extraordinary alarm.

12:52.160 --> 12:56.160
Here are some selected entries. I have alerted border patrol and military this is a national

12:56.160 --> 13:00.880
emergency. Must change laws. Many gang members and some very bad people are mixing to the caravan

13:00.880 --> 13:04.240
heading to our border. Please go back. You will not be admitted into the United States.

13:04.240 --> 13:09.680
This is the exact same thing that you said Israel should do. This is an invasion of our country and

13:09.680 --> 13:15.360
our military is waiting for you. Trump's right. And it's exactly what you said it was completely

13:15.360 --> 13:20.960
fine for Israel to do. Let's finish off with some slate fun. I'm so sorry to report that

13:20.960 --> 13:27.040
Ted Cruz's new beard looks great. Sometimes every once in a while, you have to admit that somebody

13:27.040 --> 13:31.680
that you may disagree with politically or ideologically is not a complete fucking scumbag

13:31.680 --> 13:36.800
serial killer. I have no particular fondness for the subject and it brings me no pleasure to cover

13:36.800 --> 13:42.960
it. But as a truth seeking journalist, I feel I must write what follows. Senator Ted Cruz's new

13:42.960 --> 13:49.280
beard looks great. I bet that is the first time ever a slate journalist has written an inconvenient

13:49.280 --> 13:54.400
truth. Cruz showed up in the senate with a filled out salt and pepper beard giving his face a

13:54.400 --> 13:59.360
defined jawline and its first ever hints of ruggedness and affability. Cruz's new beard

13:59.360 --> 14:05.440
serves as a proof point for a few aesthetic and economic theories. First, beards are contouring

14:05.440 --> 14:09.840
for men. Men who complain that women who wear a ton of makeup or don sunglasses in their tinder

14:09.840 --> 14:14.560
profiles are scamming men into thinking they're hotter than they are had better never grow facial

14:14.560 --> 14:19.120
hair because beards are capable of facial trickery. I think there's a big difference there. Beards are

14:19.120 --> 14:24.640
a natural part of what men are and makeup isn't. You have to take makeup off at the end of the day.

14:24.640 --> 14:30.240
The beard can just stay. I'm sorry for the lack of videos this week, guys, but that giant Mastercard

14:30.240 --> 14:34.160
project that I put out yesterday sucked up like five days of my time. And I'm also sorry about

14:34.160 --> 14:38.640
this SJ Weekly being shorter than normal. That's because I have a stream to prepare for tonight.

14:38.640 --> 14:44.640
It's the December community stream. It's happening tonight at 730 EST. If you're a Twitch sub or a

14:45.920 --> 14:51.840
Patreon Donator, you are eligible to join us on a voice call while we watch Star Wars The Holiday

14:51.840 --> 14:55.920
Special. And of course, you can always still watch in the chat room with us as well. In terms of

14:55.920 --> 15:00.640
channel support, I still have to stick with Patreon, unfortunately, because there are as of

15:00.640 --> 15:05.200
yet no viable alternatives. Let's keep our fingers crossed that we can figure something out. In any

15:05.200 --> 15:07.520
case, I hope to see you guys tonight.
