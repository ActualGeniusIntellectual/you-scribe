00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Hello, welcome to SJ Weekly. No coffee slurps this time because I don't have any coffee.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,320
Instead, I have chocolate-coated roasted coffee beans. Check this out.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,880
They're really crunchy and I feel like they're loaded with caffeine.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,080
Let's start with, a college student was told to remove a fuck nazis sign because it wasn't

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,560
inclusive. This email tells me the university cares more about the feelings of nazis and the

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,200
safety of their students. Well, let's be honest, this is the endpoint of identity politics.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,400
If you can racialize a non-racial group like, say, Muslims, they're very clearly a religion,

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,920
not a race, and the process of racializing them is to collectivize them together through shared

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,160
beliefs and values and behaviors, and then consider them outsiders within the main society,

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,640
you can obviously also do that to nazis, which basically makes nazis a minority race. So I'm not

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,040
surprised that the university did this. Nicole Parson said she was fed up with her university's

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,000
silence over a string of hate crimes on campus when she put up a sign in her dorm window that

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,600
read, fuck nazis, you are not welcome here. I wonder what these hate crimes on campus were.

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,520
Were they somebody posting flyers that say something like, you know, it's okay to be

15
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,800
white or something nonsensical like that? Very clearly not a hate crime. In my opinion,

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:29,280
she should be allowed to leave this up. In fact, it's obviously regressive SJW bullshit,

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,160
but it's her dorm. It's her freedom of speech. She shouldn't have to take it down.

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,400
A week after posting the sign in her dorm window, she received an email from a resident director

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,880
asking her to remove the sign over issues of inclusion. The email says I'm one of the

20
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,840
residence directors at UMass Amherst and currently the RD on call for East Side. I'm emailing you

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,240
today in regards to a phone call I've received concerning a sign that is placed in your window.

22
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,840
From this conversation, it appears to be that the sign mentioned can be paraphrased

23
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,080
as nazis are not welcome here. Though the sign is permitted under freedom of speech,

24
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,000
I would also like to discuss the impact on the community that the sign has had.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,360
There are some in the community who have expressed that the sign should be taken down

26
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,080
as it has created mixed emotions in the community on how to proceed, issues of inclusion,

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,080
and the ability to be active members of their community. While residence education cannot

28
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,320
force you or your roommate to take the sign down, I am asking that you or your roommate take the

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,320
sign down so that all students can be part of an inclusive residential experience as well as

30
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,280
having a respectful environment to be a part of here on campus. So as it turns out, she's not

31
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,400
even being forced to take it down. It's just that somebody complained and then these people,

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,160
being the cucks that they are, are saying that, oh, somebody feels bad about this,

33
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,360
so can you please take it down? No, you know what? She should leave it up. She's probably stupid,

34
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,840
and the reason she put up the sign is also probably stupid, but it's her right and she

35
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,480
should leave it up. I was in absolute shock. This email tells me that university cares more about

36
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,680
the feelings of Nazis and the safety of their students. You know what? The university shouldn't

37
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,920
care about either of those things. The university should care about providing an education. If

38
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,080
people want to have political disagreements and exchange points of view, that's their business.

39
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,360
As long as it doesn't become violent, the university should not be stepping in.

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,760
Here's a great tweet from Bro Team Pill. I've always respected this guy's stuff.

41
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,640
Gamers, important warning, do not bring your meme shit to class or to anywhere.

42
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:52,000
Wow, I gotta say, the students going to school now seem to be fucking cucks as well.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,640
There are obvious issues with Diablo Immortal. I did a video talking about it earlier,

44
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,560
but I guess they just found it offensive, so they had to talk about it at school or something,

45
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,360
which is just surreal. When I was in high school, talking about video game stuff at school would

46
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,000
mean that the teacher would tell us to shut up. Main Teen says struggles with gender identity

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
led to brutal stabbing deaths of parents and pet dog. Jesus Christ. Andrea Balser has been

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
sentenced to 40 years after admitting to killing her parents in October 2016.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,360
I know there are a lot of people that would just attribute this to the fact that she's trans.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,440
I wouldn't necessarily go that far, though there does seem to be some kind of correlation between

51
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,480
being trans and other mental issues, for obvious reasons. A teenager who said she killed her

52
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,440
parents and the family's pet dog because of struggles with her gender identity has been

53
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,320
sentenced to 40 years in jail. She was 17 at the time when she snapped and fatally stabbed

54
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,880
her parents. That's fucking insane. Balser alleged she was struggling to deal with her

55
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,200
transition from male to female and that her family offered her no support during this time.

56
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,680
She also claimed she was molested for years by her mother and physically and mentally

57
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,600
abused by her father, accusations the rest of the family denied. This is fucked, man.

58
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,920
Assuming that she's telling the truth, and she might be. Families do like to cover this

59
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,680
kind of thing up. Assuming she's telling the truth, she seems to be a victim who has become

60
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,400
a perpetrator. Assuming that she's not, and she just used that as a cover story, it's very clear

61
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:30,720
that this was somebody who needed help and didn't get it. It's very common for families to not offer

62
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,240
support when people start to transition, and so I'm not surprised that something like this happened.

63
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm not trying to excuse it away. Very clearly, she still takes the blame for stabbing people,

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,960
no matter what the actual truth is. Her brother told the court that her claims that she did not

65
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,840
receive any support during her transition were an insult to our family, an insult to society,

66
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,120
and an insult to the LGBTQ community. There was no hatred, there was no malice, there was no ill will.

67
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,240
There was resignation, to be sure, but ultimately there was acceptance. To justify these killings

68
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,560
because of sexual identity or gender dysphoria beliefs is a truly cowardly act. Andrea should

69
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,960
be ashamed of herself for it, and the judge did say he did not take her struggles with gender

70
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,440
identity into account when sentencing her. This is just a sad situation all around. I know there's a

71
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,440
meme floating around right now about how trans activists, especially radical trans activists,

72
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:28,080
claim that anybody who basically is not a radical trans activist, their belief harms and kills

73
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,280
trans people. You know, misgendering them or using the wrong pronouns or whatever. It literally kills

74
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,640
trans people, and the meme is that, well, it turns out that being trans actually kills people. I can

75
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,400
see why you might get a chuckle out of that. There's some dark humor there, but this is just a sad

76
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,560
situation. Y'all, this is real. There is a sexy eagle ad on fur affinity that leads to healthcare.gov.

77
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,880
Are you fucking, are you serious?

78
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,360
You wouldn't bang an eagle without having healthcare insurance?

79
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,720
I, uh, I don't think I'd bang an eagle at all, thank you very much. On the BBC,

80
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,080
girls are more likely to face loneliness. All right. Young women are more likely than

81
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,120
young men to have feelings of loneliness. According to a study from the office for

82
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,200
national statistics, one in 10 young people in the UK often feel lonely.

83
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,480
Is, is this really worth, I can see how it can be worth a study, but is this really worth an

84
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,880
article on? Like everyone feels lonely sometimes, you know, sometimes you want to hang out with

85
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,760
somebody and nobody's available. So you got to spend like an evening by yourself and you go like,

86
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,520
oh, that's kind of lonely. You know, there's a difference between feeling lonely once in a while

87
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,000
and like having no friends. The study found a stigma attached to loneliness with young people

88
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,240
fearing it would be seen as failing. Um, maybe, maybe that's a new thing. I know that I never

89
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,240
felt a stigma attached to loneliness, at least not like short-term loneliness. I think everyone

90
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,280
has nights once in a while where you want to see somebody but can't, and then you're just like,

91
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,800
oh, well, I guess I'm by myself. It doesn't, it doesn't feel like you're failing. It feels like

92
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,480
you're lonely and maybe you're bored. I can see though, if you, you know, can't maintain friendships

93
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,880
or something that it would, it could be seen as failing. I can see that. The, there were young

94
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,280
people who used social media to cover up their feelings and pretend their lives were not lonely.

95
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,760
I can see that too, because social media is just one giant fucking parade where everyone compares

96
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,600
the shitty parts of their own lives to the good parts of other people's lives. It's actually been

97
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,840
a, been a problem for me too. You know, I think everyone has this problem. Like I've, I've logged

98
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,720
in and seen high school and college friends doing some pretty incredible things with their lives,

99
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,080
things that I wish that I'd be doing, but that I'm not. And part of me is like, well, I guess I'm

100
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,000
just a failure. And you know, maybe I am, but part of me also recognizes that those are highlights.

101
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,560
Those aren't the average times of their life. It's the best times of their life. I could post some

102
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,600
pretty remarkable things that I've done. And I'm sure some of them during their lower points would

103
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,400
look at that and also feel the same way. The study from the ONS looks at the extent of loneliness

104
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,720
among people aged between 10 and 24. There were about 11% who often felt lonely and a 34% who

105
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,680
sometimes felt lonely with more girls than boys feeling this way. And this is why the BBC is

106
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,720
talking about it. It's a gendered issue for them. It's a girl's issue. Of course it is. But let's

107
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,960
actually look at that study from the ONS. I have it right here. Children's and young people's

108
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,000
experiences of loneliness 2018. And this is how you can tell that the BBC only read the headlines

109
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,320
of the study and just picked out things that fit with their worldview. You have the headline of

110
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,880
this section in the study, girls report experiencing loneliness slightly more often than boys.

111
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,280
Okay, that's fine. That's what the BBC printed. Here's the actual content. On the loneliness

112
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:50,080
scale, boys were more likely than girls to score three, the lowest score, with 38.5% of boys and

113
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,520
29.9% of girls scoring in this way respectively. This means that boys were more likely than girls

114
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:01,520
to say hardly ever or never. What this means is that boys are not lonely more than girls.

115
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,920
But that doesn't necessarily mean that the inverse is true, that girls are actually more lonely than

116
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,520
boys. Girls were more likely to score four, five, and six in the scale, suggesting that

117
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,760
they were more likely than boys to choose the response some of the time. So there are more

118
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,400
girls who are sometimes lonely than boys. However, when asked directly how often they feel lonely,

119
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:27,920
we found no significant differences between boys and girls. 12.6% of boys reported that they often

120
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,160
felt lonely compared with 10.1% of girls, while over half of boys and half of girls reported

121
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,560
that they hardly ever or never felt lonely. So as it turns out, when it comes to constant

122
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,080
loneliness, there's actually 2% more boys. It's not even that big of a gap, but it's still

123
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,960
ultimately a boy's problem. So the BBC did not actually read the contents of the study.

124
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,680
They just printed what looked good to them. You can see on this graph that on the left side,

125
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,440
there are more boys than girls that don't feel lonely at all. In the middle, there are more girls

126
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,560
than boys that sometimes feel lonely. And then on the right, there are more boys than girls that

127
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,520
always feel lonely. This honestly doesn't surprise me because in general, and in almost every

128
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,920
measurement, men seem to hang out at the extremes more than women on average. This works out across

129
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,920
most metrics, whether we're talking about life success or earnings or average strength or average

130
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,800
intelligence or creativity. I'm not saying that women can't excel at any of these things. They

131
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,600
obviously can, but men are more likely to boom or bust while women are more likely to hang out

132
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,000
around the average. But of course, the BBC doesn't care about any of that kind of nuance. They just

133
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,800
want to print what they want to print. This is an older article, May 15th, 2018. Israel has the

134
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,520
right and obligation to defend its border with deadly force by David French on the National

135
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,440
Review. Israeli border police officers take positions during a Palestinian protest of the

136
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,760
US embassy move to Jerusalem. Would you let people who want to kill you into your home?

137
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,480
One of the enduring mysteries of modern political discourse is the way in which smart people who

138
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,520
are not remotely anti-Semitic impose curious, unworkable double standards on the nation of

139
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:11,120
Israel. Let's take, for example, the response of many on the left to the so-called Great Return

140
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,240
March, an effort by thousands of Gazans to storm the Israeli border. A nation has the right to

141
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,800
protect its integrity of its border, and that right is supplemented by an inherent right of

142
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,160
self-defense in the face of a hostile foreign power. Yeah, it's all reasonable, isn't it?

143
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,240
This David French guy knows what he's talking about. Oh, here's David French on October 30th,

144
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,520
2018. It's time to calm down about the caravan. What happened to the nation having a right to

145
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,760
protect its border? What happened to the right of self-defense? When Gazans were marching on

146
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,160
Israel, it was a big deal. Honestly, it's hard to think of a response less measured and more

147
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,000
effective at undermining moderate support for immigration restrictions than the reaction of

148
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,160
the president and key allies. The president's tweets have conveyed extraordinary alarm.

149
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,160
Here are some selected entries. I have alerted border patrol and military this is a national

150
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,880
emergency. Must change laws. Many gang members and some very bad people are mixing to the caravan

151
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,240
heading to our border. Please go back. You will not be admitted into the United States.

152
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,680
This is the exact same thing that you said Israel should do. This is an invasion of our country and

153
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,360
our military is waiting for you. Trump's right. And it's exactly what you said it was completely

154
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,960
fine for Israel to do. Let's finish off with some slate fun. I'm so sorry to report that

155
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:27,040
Ted Cruz's new beard looks great. Sometimes every once in a while, you have to admit that somebody

156
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,680
that you may disagree with politically or ideologically is not a complete fucking scumbag

157
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,800
serial killer. I have no particular fondness for the subject and it brings me no pleasure to cover

158
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,960
it. But as a truth seeking journalist, I feel I must write what follows. Senator Ted Cruz's new

159
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:49,280
beard looks great. I bet that is the first time ever a slate journalist has written an inconvenient

160
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,400
truth. Cruz showed up in the senate with a filled out salt and pepper beard giving his face a

161
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,360
defined jawline and its first ever hints of ruggedness and affability. Cruz's new beard

162
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,440
serves as a proof point for a few aesthetic and economic theories. First, beards are contouring

163
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,840
for men. Men who complain that women who wear a ton of makeup or don sunglasses in their tinder

164
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,560
profiles are scamming men into thinking they're hotter than they are had better never grow facial

165
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,120
hair because beards are capable of facial trickery. I think there's a big difference there. Beards are

166
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,640
a natural part of what men are and makeup isn't. You have to take makeup off at the end of the day.

167
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,240
The beard can just stay. I'm sorry for the lack of videos this week, guys, but that giant Mastercard

168
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,160
project that I put out yesterday sucked up like five days of my time. And I'm also sorry about

169
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,640
this SJ Weekly being shorter than normal. That's because I have a stream to prepare for tonight.

170
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:44,640
It's the December community stream. It's happening tonight at 730 EST. If you're a Twitch sub or a

171
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,840
Patreon Donator, you are eligible to join us on a voice call while we watch Star Wars The Holiday

172
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,920
Special. And of course, you can always still watch in the chat room with us as well. In terms of

173
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,640
channel support, I still have to stick with Patreon, unfortunately, because there are as of

174
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,200
yet no viable alternatives. Let's keep our fingers crossed that we can figure something out. In any

175
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,520
case, I hope to see you guys tonight.
