0	4880	Hello, welcome to SJ Weekly. No coffee slurps this time because I don't have any coffee.
4880	10320	Instead, I have chocolate-coated roasted coffee beans. Check this out.
15440	18880	They're really crunchy and I feel like they're loaded with caffeine.
18880	24080	Let's start with, a college student was told to remove a fuck nazis sign because it wasn't
24080	28560	inclusive. This email tells me the university cares more about the feelings of nazis and the
28560	33200	safety of their students. Well, let's be honest, this is the endpoint of identity politics.
33200	38400	If you can racialize a non-racial group like, say, Muslims, they're very clearly a religion,
38400	43920	not a race, and the process of racializing them is to collectivize them together through shared
43920	50160	beliefs and values and behaviors, and then consider them outsiders within the main society,
50160	56640	you can obviously also do that to nazis, which basically makes nazis a minority race. So I'm not
56640	61040	surprised that the university did this. Nicole Parson said she was fed up with her university's
61040	66000	silence over a string of hate crimes on campus when she put up a sign in her dorm window that
66000	71600	read, fuck nazis, you are not welcome here. I wonder what these hate crimes on campus were.
72880	77520	Were they somebody posting flyers that say something like, you know, it's okay to be
77520	82800	white or something nonsensical like that? Very clearly not a hate crime. In my opinion,
82800	89280	she should be allowed to leave this up. In fact, it's obviously regressive SJW bullshit,
89280	94160	but it's her dorm. It's her freedom of speech. She shouldn't have to take it down.
94160	98400	A week after posting the sign in her dorm window, she received an email from a resident director
98400	102880	asking her to remove the sign over issues of inclusion. The email says I'm one of the
102880	107840	residence directors at UMass Amherst and currently the RD on call for East Side. I'm emailing you
107840	112240	today in regards to a phone call I've received concerning a sign that is placed in your window.
112240	115840	From this conversation, it appears to be that the sign mentioned can be paraphrased
115840	120080	as nazis are not welcome here. Though the sign is permitted under freedom of speech,
120080	124000	I would also like to discuss the impact on the community that the sign has had.
124000	127360	There are some in the community who have expressed that the sign should be taken down
127360	132080	as it has created mixed emotions in the community on how to proceed, issues of inclusion,
132080	136080	and the ability to be active members of their community. While residence education cannot
136080	140320	force you or your roommate to take the sign down, I am asking that you or your roommate take the
140320	144320	sign down so that all students can be part of an inclusive residential experience as well as
144320	149280	having a respectful environment to be a part of here on campus. So as it turns out, she's not
149280	154400	even being forced to take it down. It's just that somebody complained and then these people,
154400	158160	being the cucks that they are, are saying that, oh, somebody feels bad about this,
158160	163360	so can you please take it down? No, you know what? She should leave it up. She's probably stupid,
163360	167840	and the reason she put up the sign is also probably stupid, but it's her right and she
167840	172480	should leave it up. I was in absolute shock. This email tells me that university cares more about
172480	175680	the feelings of Nazis and the safety of their students. You know what? The university shouldn't
175680	179920	care about either of those things. The university should care about providing an education. If
179920	184080	people want to have political disagreements and exchange points of view, that's their business.
184080	187360	As long as it doesn't become violent, the university should not be stepping in.
187360	191760	Here's a great tweet from Bro Team Pill. I've always respected this guy's stuff.
191760	196640	Gamers, important warning, do not bring your meme shit to class or to anywhere.
221760	232000	Wow, I gotta say, the students going to school now seem to be fucking cucks as well.
232000	236640	There are obvious issues with Diablo Immortal. I did a video talking about it earlier,
236640	240560	but I guess they just found it offensive, so they had to talk about it at school or something,
240560	245360	which is just surreal. When I was in high school, talking about video game stuff at school would
245360	250000	mean that the teacher would tell us to shut up. Main Teen says struggles with gender identity
250000	256000	led to brutal stabbing deaths of parents and pet dog. Jesus Christ. Andrea Balser has been
256000	260000	sentenced to 40 years after admitting to killing her parents in October 2016.
260000	265360	I know there are a lot of people that would just attribute this to the fact that she's trans.
266000	271440	I wouldn't necessarily go that far, though there does seem to be some kind of correlation between
271440	276480	being trans and other mental issues, for obvious reasons. A teenager who said she killed her
276480	279440	parents and the family's pet dog because of struggles with her gender identity has been
279440	284320	sentenced to 40 years in jail. She was 17 at the time when she snapped and fatally stabbed
284320	288880	her parents. That's fucking insane. Balser alleged she was struggling to deal with her
288880	293200	transition from male to female and that her family offered her no support during this time.
293200	297680	She also claimed she was molested for years by her mother and physically and mentally
297680	303600	abused by her father, accusations the rest of the family denied. This is fucked, man.
304560	309920	Assuming that she's telling the truth, and she might be. Families do like to cover this
309920	315680	kind of thing up. Assuming she's telling the truth, she seems to be a victim who has become
315680	322400	a perpetrator. Assuming that she's not, and she just used that as a cover story, it's very clear
322400	330720	that this was somebody who needed help and didn't get it. It's very common for families to not offer
330800	336240	support when people start to transition, and so I'm not surprised that something like this happened.
337040	342000	I'm not trying to excuse it away. Very clearly, she still takes the blame for stabbing people,
342000	346960	no matter what the actual truth is. Her brother told the court that her claims that she did not
346960	351840	receive any support during her transition were an insult to our family, an insult to society,
351840	357120	and an insult to the LGBTQ community. There was no hatred, there was no malice, there was no ill will.
357120	362240	There was resignation, to be sure, but ultimately there was acceptance. To justify these killings
362240	366560	because of sexual identity or gender dysphoria beliefs is a truly cowardly act. Andrea should
366560	370960	be ashamed of herself for it, and the judge did say he did not take her struggles with gender
370960	375440	identity into account when sentencing her. This is just a sad situation all around. I know there's a
375440	381440	meme floating around right now about how trans activists, especially radical trans activists,
381440	388080	claim that anybody who basically is not a radical trans activist, their belief harms and kills
388080	393280	trans people. You know, misgendering them or using the wrong pronouns or whatever. It literally kills
393280	398640	trans people, and the meme is that, well, it turns out that being trans actually kills people. I can
398640	402400	see why you might get a chuckle out of that. There's some dark humor there, but this is just a sad
402400	408560	situation. Y'all, this is real. There is a sexy eagle ad on fur affinity that leads to healthcare.gov.
409440	410880	Are you fucking, are you serious?
416320	419360	You wouldn't bang an eagle without having healthcare insurance?
428480	432720	I, uh, I don't think I'd bang an eagle at all, thank you very much. On the BBC,
432720	438080	girls are more likely to face loneliness. All right. Young women are more likely than
438080	441120	young men to have feelings of loneliness. According to a study from the office for
441120	445200	national statistics, one in 10 young people in the UK often feel lonely.
446240	450480	Is, is this really worth, I can see how it can be worth a study, but is this really worth an
450480	454880	article on? Like everyone feels lonely sometimes, you know, sometimes you want to hang out with
454880	459760	somebody and nobody's available. So you got to spend like an evening by yourself and you go like,
459760	463520	oh, that's kind of lonely. You know, there's a difference between feeling lonely once in a while
463520	468000	and like having no friends. The study found a stigma attached to loneliness with young people
468000	474240	fearing it would be seen as failing. Um, maybe, maybe that's a new thing. I know that I never
474240	478240	felt a stigma attached to loneliness, at least not like short-term loneliness. I think everyone
478240	481280	has nights once in a while where you want to see somebody but can't, and then you're just like,
481280	484800	oh, well, I guess I'm by myself. It doesn't, it doesn't feel like you're failing. It feels like
484800	490480	you're lonely and maybe you're bored. I can see though, if you, you know, can't maintain friendships
490480	494880	or something that it would, it could be seen as failing. I can see that. The, there were young
494880	499280	people who used social media to cover up their feelings and pretend their lives were not lonely.
500240	505760	I can see that too, because social media is just one giant fucking parade where everyone compares
505760	509600	the shitty parts of their own lives to the good parts of other people's lives. It's actually been
509600	513840	a, been a problem for me too. You know, I think everyone has this problem. Like I've, I've logged
513840	518720	in and seen high school and college friends doing some pretty incredible things with their lives,
518720	524080	things that I wish that I'd be doing, but that I'm not. And part of me is like, well, I guess I'm
524080	530000	just a failure. And you know, maybe I am, but part of me also recognizes that those are highlights.
530000	534560	Those aren't the average times of their life. It's the best times of their life. I could post some
534560	539600	pretty remarkable things that I've done. And I'm sure some of them during their lower points would
539600	544400	look at that and also feel the same way. The study from the ONS looks at the extent of loneliness
544400	550720	among people aged between 10 and 24. There were about 11% who often felt lonely and a 34% who
550720	555680	sometimes felt lonely with more girls than boys feeling this way. And this is why the BBC is
555680	560720	talking about it. It's a gendered issue for them. It's a girl's issue. Of course it is. But let's
560720	564960	actually look at that study from the ONS. I have it right here. Children's and young people's
564960	570000	experiences of loneliness 2018. And this is how you can tell that the BBC only read the headlines
570000	574320	of the study and just picked out things that fit with their worldview. You have the headline of
574320	578880	this section in the study, girls report experiencing loneliness slightly more often than boys.
578880	583280	Okay, that's fine. That's what the BBC printed. Here's the actual content. On the loneliness
583280	590080	scale, boys were more likely than girls to score three, the lowest score, with 38.5% of boys and
590080	595520	29.9% of girls scoring in this way respectively. This means that boys were more likely than girls
595520	601520	to say hardly ever or never. What this means is that boys are not lonely more than girls.
601520	605920	But that doesn't necessarily mean that the inverse is true, that girls are actually more lonely than
605920	609520	boys. Girls were more likely to score four, five, and six in the scale, suggesting that
609520	613760	they were more likely than boys to choose the response some of the time. So there are more
613760	620400	girls who are sometimes lonely than boys. However, when asked directly how often they feel lonely,
620400	627920	we found no significant differences between boys and girls. 12.6% of boys reported that they often
627920	634160	felt lonely compared with 10.1% of girls, while over half of boys and half of girls reported
634160	638560	that they hardly ever or never felt lonely. So as it turns out, when it comes to constant
638560	644080	loneliness, there's actually 2% more boys. It's not even that big of a gap, but it's still
644080	648960	ultimately a boy's problem. So the BBC did not actually read the contents of the study.
649760	655680	They just printed what looked good to them. You can see on this graph that on the left side,
655680	661440	there are more boys than girls that don't feel lonely at all. In the middle, there are more girls
661440	666560	than boys that sometimes feel lonely. And then on the right, there are more boys than girls that
666560	671520	always feel lonely. This honestly doesn't surprise me because in general, and in almost every
671520	677920	measurement, men seem to hang out at the extremes more than women on average. This works out across
677920	683920	most metrics, whether we're talking about life success or earnings or average strength or average
683920	688800	intelligence or creativity. I'm not saying that women can't excel at any of these things. They
688800	693600	obviously can, but men are more likely to boom or bust while women are more likely to hang out
693600	698000	around the average. But of course, the BBC doesn't care about any of that kind of nuance. They just
698000	702800	want to print what they want to print. This is an older article, May 15th, 2018. Israel has the
702800	707520	right and obligation to defend its border with deadly force by David French on the National
707520	711440	Review. Israeli border police officers take positions during a Palestinian protest of the
711440	715760	US embassy move to Jerusalem. Would you let people who want to kill you into your home?
715760	720480	One of the enduring mysteries of modern political discourse is the way in which smart people who
720480	725520	are not remotely anti-Semitic impose curious, unworkable double standards on the nation of
725520	731120	Israel. Let's take, for example, the response of many on the left to the so-called Great Return
731120	736240	March, an effort by thousands of Gazans to storm the Israeli border. A nation has the right to
736240	740800	protect its integrity of its border, and that right is supplemented by an inherent right of
740800	746160	self-defense in the face of a hostile foreign power. Yeah, it's all reasonable, isn't it?
746160	750240	This David French guy knows what he's talking about. Oh, here's David French on October 30th,
750240	755520	2018. It's time to calm down about the caravan. What happened to the nation having a right to
755520	759760	protect its border? What happened to the right of self-defense? When Gazans were marching on
759760	764160	Israel, it was a big deal. Honestly, it's hard to think of a response less measured and more
764160	768000	effective at undermining moderate support for immigration restrictions than the reaction of
768080	772160	the president and key allies. The president's tweets have conveyed extraordinary alarm.
772160	776160	Here are some selected entries. I have alerted border patrol and military this is a national
776160	780880	emergency. Must change laws. Many gang members and some very bad people are mixing to the caravan
780880	784240	heading to our border. Please go back. You will not be admitted into the United States.
784240	789680	This is the exact same thing that you said Israel should do. This is an invasion of our country and
789680	795360	our military is waiting for you. Trump's right. And it's exactly what you said it was completely
795360	800960	fine for Israel to do. Let's finish off with some slate fun. I'm so sorry to report that
800960	807040	Ted Cruz's new beard looks great. Sometimes every once in a while, you have to admit that somebody
807040	811680	that you may disagree with politically or ideologically is not a complete fucking scumbag
811680	816800	serial killer. I have no particular fondness for the subject and it brings me no pleasure to cover
816800	822960	it. But as a truth seeking journalist, I feel I must write what follows. Senator Ted Cruz's new
822960	829280	beard looks great. I bet that is the first time ever a slate journalist has written an inconvenient
829280	834400	truth. Cruz showed up in the senate with a filled out salt and pepper beard giving his face a
834400	839360	defined jawline and its first ever hints of ruggedness and affability. Cruz's new beard
839360	845440	serves as a proof point for a few aesthetic and economic theories. First, beards are contouring
845440	849840	for men. Men who complain that women who wear a ton of makeup or don sunglasses in their tinder
849840	854560	profiles are scamming men into thinking they're hotter than they are had better never grow facial
854560	859120	hair because beards are capable of facial trickery. I think there's a big difference there. Beards are
859120	864640	a natural part of what men are and makeup isn't. You have to take makeup off at the end of the day.
864640	870240	The beard can just stay. I'm sorry for the lack of videos this week, guys, but that giant Mastercard
870240	874160	project that I put out yesterday sucked up like five days of my time. And I'm also sorry about
874160	878640	this SJ Weekly being shorter than normal. That's because I have a stream to prepare for tonight.
878640	884640	It's the December community stream. It's happening tonight at 730 EST. If you're a Twitch sub or a
885920	891840	Patreon Donator, you are eligible to join us on a voice call while we watch Star Wars The Holiday
891840	895920	Special. And of course, you can always still watch in the chat room with us as well. In terms of
895920	900640	channel support, I still have to stick with Patreon, unfortunately, because there are as of
900640	905200	yet no viable alternatives. Let's keep our fingers crossed that we can figure something out. In any
905200	907520	case, I hope to see you guys tonight.
