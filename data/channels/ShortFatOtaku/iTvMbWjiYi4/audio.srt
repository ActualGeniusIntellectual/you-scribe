1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Oh boy, it's been a long time since I've been here, eh? At this point, I have been gone long enough

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,800
that you guys deserve to hear about what I've been doing, what I haven't been doing,

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,840
when I'm coming back, which by the way is right now, and what the plans are. So let's go over it.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,400
Back during the first presidential debate, which was I think September 29th, 2020,

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,640
putting it nearly six months ago, jeez, time flies. I was streaming the debate with Scrump

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,320
and Arch Warhammer and a few other people, a few of my friends, Lilith was there,

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,800
and Scrump, being the naughty boy that he is, said the gamer words. Now, none of us knew this

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,560
at the time, but we were actually on the front page of YouTube, which is why we had I think

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:46,000
nearly 5,000 people watching. If you were to go to youtube.com and just go there logged out,

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,920
you would see my channel on the front. I was certainly getting more traffic than some of the

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,440
news network streams of the 2020 presidential debates, but being on the front page of YouTube,

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,400
combined with gamer words, combined with the fact that I am not one of those lucky pre-approved

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,240
progressive channels that YouTube likes to protect, well, I got demonetized. And yes,

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,640
through some people that know people and through some back alley stuff, I did eventually find out

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,360
that it was because of Scrump. So you can all go and yell at him if you like. But the point is,

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,240
I had at least a fair shot at getting demonetized. So I said, you know what? No,

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,720
I'm not going to work for free YouTube. I'm not just going to make videos and have you run ads

18
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,120
on them and then take all the revenue. I'm going to apply to get my monetization back,

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,200
which I did. It took until about mid January, but I did. And in the meantime, I'm going to do some

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,080
other things. I ordered some new artwork and I ordered some new music and I got to work on a

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,040
rebrand. I started re-uploading my backlog to other sites like Bitchute and Odyssey and others.

22
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,080
In fact, the only one that I kind of forgot about was Dailymotion. I'll get on that a bit.

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,600
Dailymotion kind of sucks though, because you can only really upload like five videos a day.

24
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,400
So to upload my entire backlog, it's going to take a while, you know? In the 11th hour,

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,240
it actually felt like I wasn't going to get my channel back. So I started another channel

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,520
called Devtrospective. And to be honest, I like the name enough that I might actually turn

27
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,960
this channel, Shrek Fight Otaku, into Devtrospective. Because frankly,

28
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,160
SFO, it's funny, but it doesn't really match what I do anymore. Like I still like anime.

29
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,800
I'm still short. I'm still fat. I'm still an otaku. But that name was picked before because

30
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,000
back in 2009 we were doing anime reviews, and we're not really doing that on this channel

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,840
anymore. So I'm not sure exactly what I want to do. Maybe the channel can be Devtrospective,

32
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,160
or the series can be Devtrospective, and SFO can be the person who does it. At the same time,

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,960
Dev is my name. I don't mind being called Dev at all. But that is where I've been.

34
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,600
And for the most part, it's been my side channel, my Game Boomers channel over on Twitch,

35
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,120
that has been keeping me afloat. And yes, Game Boomers is not nearly as successful as SFO right

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,400
now, but I treat it just as seriously. I stream there like five times a week, and I get enough

37
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,480
money to live. So it's pretty good, all things considered. By the way, if you haven't checked

38
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,320
it out yet, you should totally check it out, am I right? But this story doesn't account for

39
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,800
everything. Around late December, early January, my house had some renovations go on, and I found

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,000
myself unable to do anything. Unable to do any SFO recordings, even if I wanted to. Unable to do the

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,720
Game Boomers streams, because the room being renovated was literally the Game Boomers studio.

42
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,360
And then, in resetting up everything for Game Boomers, I didn't have the help that I thought

43
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,680
I would. I was expecting my roommate to be back at that time, he wasn't back from his travels yet,

44
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,280
so I had to kind of do it all myself. That added a few more days to the rebuilding of the studio.

45
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,560
Basically a bunch of things happened all at once, back in early January, that kept me from coming

46
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,400
back to Game Boomers until like the end of January. So for a good solid month there,

47
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,640
unless you were seeing me on Discord, like talking to the community a little bit,

48
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,680
I was gone. I was like, I was gone from the internet. And although Game Boomers, again,

49
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,720
is not as successful as SFO, the income that I get from it is more regular, and it is a little bit

50
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,000
easier to do. So my priority was getting that back up, just so I could have something while I

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,200
tried to rebuild SFO. While all this was going down, I realized I'd been watching a fair amount

52
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,840
of BreadTube. And guys, don't worry, I'm not a BreadTuber, I'm not a socialist, I'm not

53
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,920
interested in converting to those ideas at all. I will always be a liberal. A liberal the way that

54
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,360
it's supposed to be known as, not the way that Rush Limbaugh used it to describe a socialist.

55
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,480
No, no, no. I am a liberal. I am within the liberal tent of politics. I view what smooth

56
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,880
brains call the far left and the far right with an equal amount of disdain. But I realized that

57
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,200
there are a lot of liberal commentators who don't quite know what BreadTube believes,

58
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,160
or why they believe what they do. And I will say, after having watched a few months worth

59
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,680
of their content, I'm not convinced by anything that they've had to say. But at the very least,

60
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:10,160
I now know with more certainty why I oppose them. At this point, the only like lefty tubers

61
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:17,200
that I think have any kind of good arguments, or quality, or any kind of moral ground to stand on

62
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,800
whatsoever are probably like Destiny, who's not really considered a leftist, and ContraPoints.

63
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,240
That's it. Lindsay Ellis every once in a while, but everyone else just, they seem to be like,

64
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,400
they seem to be really hypocritical, and honestly pretty garbage. And we will be able to get into

65
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,800
why that is in the coming weeks as I make my return. Because at the same time, I've also been,

66
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,080
admittedly very slowly, chewing through a stack of interesting books that will help.

67
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,560
If there is one lesson that I've taken away from from Kraut, it's that when you have to argue your

68
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:59,120
position, don't do so on a live stream where charisma rules the day, where people are interested

69
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,360
in 30 second sound bites, and the crowd is only out for blood, not truth. Do so by reading,

70
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,080
and then presenting what you've learned in a logical, coherent way. And I think, among all of,

71
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,400
I don't know what you want to call it, like LibTube, I know Kraut hates LibTube, but among

72
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,520
all of liberal YouTube, Kraut is one of the better people at that for sure. And so is Sargon with his

73
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,760
book club. I know those two hate each other, it's like oil and water at this point, but they do seem

74
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,280
to be like the liberal and conservative side of the same coin. So I definitely appreciate both

75
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,080
their perspectives. Point is, I've been reading, and we will talk about the books again as the

76
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,200
weeks go on. And yes, at some point, I did just kind of get in my own head, you know?

77
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,480
I've described this multiple times over the years. Whenever you take a break, you feel like your

78
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,360
return has to be amazing and huge, and so you work on it, but then that work makes it take longer,

79
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,520
so then you feel like it has to be even bigger, and then you get into like a self-defeating spiral

80
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,480
when you're putting anything out. And I think it was a lot of people who said this, but I think it

81
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,320
was eventually ArchWarhammer who said, you know, just put something out. Put something out that's

82
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,800
bad. Put out a terrible video so that you're at least started again. And it's like, yeah,

83
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,720
fair enough. There's also one final topic that I can't completely cover because it is legal in

84
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,400
nature. This has been happening over the past week or two, I think. Don't worry, I'm fine.

85
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,640
It's not like a dank situation where I'm going to be like thrown away for speech or something,

86
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,480
but there is something that I can't completely talk about. I know some people have learned some

87
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:37,600
details, but there's more to it than I've even told them. And even though I can't say anything

88
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:47,200
about it, it has occupied some time and made some things harder than they had to be. I'm sure I'll

89
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,280
be able to talk to you about it at some point, sometime down the line. It'll definitely come up.

90
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,320
In fact, Lilith has said she wanted to record a podcast on it because she personally found it so

91
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:06,880
egregious. And I want to, but we have to wait. So yes, I'm back. If you see this video,

92
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:13,520
that means that SFO has officially returned. I'm here. There will be videos. There will be

93
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,800
more content. I'll be expanding some things. Maybe I'll do something approximating a regular book

94
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,280
club. I've approached Lilith with the possibility of us doing regular streams.

95
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,280
I'm going to figure a few things out, but the content to SFO is back.

96
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:36,800
Now, if you want to ask some more details about this, when you see this video, I'm streaming.

97
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,560
Again, it's over on Game Boomers. Game Boomers is kind of where I like to relax after the day's

98
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,960
work. I'll go over there. I'll play some games. I'll usually talk with the chat room because

99
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:52,080
on Game Boomers, there's maybe 50 viewers. On SFO, there's maybe 500 or sometimes more.

100
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,440
So it's hard to answer every question on SFO, but on Game Boomers, generally I can relax with

101
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,160
people and we can hang out. We can have a good time. It's not always going to be about questioning

102
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,560
me because sometimes my friends are there. Sometimes we just, we crack jokes. Sometimes

103
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,160
it's a comedy thing. Sometimes it's about me playing video games somewhat badly,

104
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,040
but I think I'm pretty good. I think I'm pretty good. But the point is that it's a variety show.

105
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,600
Politics is not banned, but it is a variety show. But when this video uploads, I'll be there. I'll

106
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,640
be hanging out. I'll be talking with people who want to see what the details are, what's going

107
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,280
on with the channel. I'll answer some questions and it will hopefully be a good time. So if you're

108
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,960
watching this, go over there right now, twitch.tv slash Game Boomers and watch this channel because

109
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,040
SFO content is coming soon.

110
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,320
Oh, how soon do you ask? Well, here's the recording of the next video.

111
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,280
I just got to edit it, so you'll see it tomorrow.
