00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
Oh boy, it's been a long time since I've been here, eh? At this point, I have been gone long enough

00:04.480 --> 00:08.800
that you guys deserve to hear about what I've been doing, what I haven't been doing,

00:08.800 --> 00:13.840
when I'm coming back, which by the way is right now, and what the plans are. So let's go over it.

00:13.840 --> 00:18.400
Back during the first presidential debate, which was I think September 29th, 2020,

00:18.960 --> 00:24.640
putting it nearly six months ago, jeez, time flies. I was streaming the debate with Scrump

00:24.640 --> 00:28.320
and Arch Warhammer and a few other people, a few of my friends, Lilith was there,

00:28.320 --> 00:34.800
and Scrump, being the naughty boy that he is, said the gamer words. Now, none of us knew this

00:34.800 --> 00:38.560
at the time, but we were actually on the front page of YouTube, which is why we had I think

00:38.560 --> 00:46.000
nearly 5,000 people watching. If you were to go to youtube.com and just go there logged out,

00:46.000 --> 00:49.920
you would see my channel on the front. I was certainly getting more traffic than some of the

00:49.920 --> 00:55.440
news network streams of the 2020 presidential debates, but being on the front page of YouTube,

00:55.440 --> 01:00.400
combined with gamer words, combined with the fact that I am not one of those lucky pre-approved

01:00.400 --> 01:06.240
progressive channels that YouTube likes to protect, well, I got demonetized. And yes,

01:06.240 --> 01:10.640
through some people that know people and through some back alley stuff, I did eventually find out

01:10.640 --> 01:15.360
that it was because of Scrump. So you can all go and yell at him if you like. But the point is,

01:15.360 --> 01:20.240
I had at least a fair shot at getting demonetized. So I said, you know what? No,

01:20.240 --> 01:24.720
I'm not going to work for free YouTube. I'm not just going to make videos and have you run ads

01:24.720 --> 01:29.120
on them and then take all the revenue. I'm going to apply to get my monetization back,

01:29.120 --> 01:35.200
which I did. It took until about mid January, but I did. And in the meantime, I'm going to do some

01:35.200 --> 01:40.080
other things. I ordered some new artwork and I ordered some new music and I got to work on a

01:40.080 --> 01:45.040
rebrand. I started re-uploading my backlog to other sites like Bitchute and Odyssey and others.

01:46.080 --> 01:50.080
In fact, the only one that I kind of forgot about was Dailymotion. I'll get on that a bit.

01:50.080 --> 01:53.600
Dailymotion kind of sucks though, because you can only really upload like five videos a day.

01:54.320 --> 01:58.400
So to upload my entire backlog, it's going to take a while, you know? In the 11th hour,

01:58.400 --> 02:02.240
it actually felt like I wasn't going to get my channel back. So I started another channel

02:02.240 --> 02:07.520
called Devtrospective. And to be honest, I like the name enough that I might actually turn

02:08.320 --> 02:12.960
this channel, Shrek Fight Otaku, into Devtrospective. Because frankly,

02:12.960 --> 02:18.160
SFO, it's funny, but it doesn't really match what I do anymore. Like I still like anime.

02:18.160 --> 02:22.800
I'm still short. I'm still fat. I'm still an otaku. But that name was picked before because

02:23.840 --> 02:28.000
back in 2009 we were doing anime reviews, and we're not really doing that on this channel

02:28.000 --> 02:31.840
anymore. So I'm not sure exactly what I want to do. Maybe the channel can be Devtrospective,

02:31.840 --> 02:36.160
or the series can be Devtrospective, and SFO can be the person who does it. At the same time,

02:36.800 --> 02:40.960
Dev is my name. I don't mind being called Dev at all. But that is where I've been.

02:41.840 --> 02:47.600
And for the most part, it's been my side channel, my Game Boomers channel over on Twitch,

02:47.600 --> 02:53.120
that has been keeping me afloat. And yes, Game Boomers is not nearly as successful as SFO right

02:53.120 --> 02:58.400
now, but I treat it just as seriously. I stream there like five times a week, and I get enough

02:58.400 --> 03:02.480
money to live. So it's pretty good, all things considered. By the way, if you haven't checked

03:02.480 --> 03:06.320
it out yet, you should totally check it out, am I right? But this story doesn't account for

03:06.320 --> 03:12.800
everything. Around late December, early January, my house had some renovations go on, and I found

03:12.800 --> 03:18.000
myself unable to do anything. Unable to do any SFO recordings, even if I wanted to. Unable to do the

03:18.000 --> 03:22.720
Game Boomers streams, because the room being renovated was literally the Game Boomers studio.

03:22.720 --> 03:29.360
And then, in resetting up everything for Game Boomers, I didn't have the help that I thought

03:29.360 --> 03:33.680
I would. I was expecting my roommate to be back at that time, he wasn't back from his travels yet,

03:33.680 --> 03:39.280
so I had to kind of do it all myself. That added a few more days to the rebuilding of the studio.

03:39.840 --> 03:44.560
Basically a bunch of things happened all at once, back in early January, that kept me from coming

03:44.560 --> 03:50.400
back to Game Boomers until like the end of January. So for a good solid month there,

03:51.360 --> 03:54.640
unless you were seeing me on Discord, like talking to the community a little bit,

03:55.280 --> 03:59.680
I was gone. I was like, I was gone from the internet. And although Game Boomers, again,

03:59.680 --> 04:06.720
is not as successful as SFO, the income that I get from it is more regular, and it is a little bit

04:06.720 --> 04:12.000
easier to do. So my priority was getting that back up, just so I could have something while I

04:12.000 --> 04:19.200
tried to rebuild SFO. While all this was going down, I realized I'd been watching a fair amount

04:19.200 --> 04:23.840
of BreadTube. And guys, don't worry, I'm not a BreadTuber, I'm not a socialist, I'm not

04:23.840 --> 04:29.920
interested in converting to those ideas at all. I will always be a liberal. A liberal the way that

04:29.920 --> 04:35.360
it's supposed to be known as, not the way that Rush Limbaugh used it to describe a socialist.

04:35.360 --> 04:40.480
No, no, no. I am a liberal. I am within the liberal tent of politics. I view what smooth

04:40.480 --> 04:46.880
brains call the far left and the far right with an equal amount of disdain. But I realized that

04:46.960 --> 04:51.200
there are a lot of liberal commentators who don't quite know what BreadTube believes,

04:51.200 --> 04:56.160
or why they believe what they do. And I will say, after having watched a few months worth

04:56.160 --> 05:01.680
of their content, I'm not convinced by anything that they've had to say. But at the very least,

05:02.320 --> 05:10.160
I now know with more certainty why I oppose them. At this point, the only like lefty tubers

05:10.160 --> 05:17.200
that I think have any kind of good arguments, or quality, or any kind of moral ground to stand on

05:17.200 --> 05:22.800
whatsoever are probably like Destiny, who's not really considered a leftist, and ContraPoints.

05:22.800 --> 05:28.240
That's it. Lindsay Ellis every once in a while, but everyone else just, they seem to be like,

05:29.120 --> 05:34.400
they seem to be really hypocritical, and honestly pretty garbage. And we will be able to get into

05:34.400 --> 05:38.800
why that is in the coming weeks as I make my return. Because at the same time, I've also been,

05:39.440 --> 05:46.080
admittedly very slowly, chewing through a stack of interesting books that will help.

05:46.080 --> 05:52.560
If there is one lesson that I've taken away from from Kraut, it's that when you have to argue your

05:52.560 --> 05:59.120
position, don't do so on a live stream where charisma rules the day, where people are interested

05:59.120 --> 06:05.360
in 30 second sound bites, and the crowd is only out for blood, not truth. Do so by reading,

06:05.360 --> 06:12.080
and then presenting what you've learned in a logical, coherent way. And I think, among all of,

06:12.080 --> 06:16.400
I don't know what you want to call it, like LibTube, I know Kraut hates LibTube, but among

06:16.400 --> 06:21.520
all of liberal YouTube, Kraut is one of the better people at that for sure. And so is Sargon with his

06:21.520 --> 06:25.760
book club. I know those two hate each other, it's like oil and water at this point, but they do seem

06:25.760 --> 06:31.280
to be like the liberal and conservative side of the same coin. So I definitely appreciate both

06:31.280 --> 06:36.080
their perspectives. Point is, I've been reading, and we will talk about the books again as the

06:36.080 --> 06:41.200
weeks go on. And yes, at some point, I did just kind of get in my own head, you know?

06:41.200 --> 06:46.480
I've described this multiple times over the years. Whenever you take a break, you feel like your

06:46.480 --> 06:51.360
return has to be amazing and huge, and so you work on it, but then that work makes it take longer,

06:51.360 --> 06:55.520
so then you feel like it has to be even bigger, and then you get into like a self-defeating spiral

06:55.520 --> 06:58.480
when you're putting anything out. And I think it was a lot of people who said this, but I think it

06:58.480 --> 07:02.320
was eventually ArchWarhammer who said, you know, just put something out. Put something out that's

07:02.320 --> 07:06.800
bad. Put out a terrible video so that you're at least started again. And it's like, yeah,

07:06.800 --> 07:12.720
fair enough. There's also one final topic that I can't completely cover because it is legal in

07:12.720 --> 07:18.400
nature. This has been happening over the past week or two, I think. Don't worry, I'm fine.

07:20.080 --> 07:24.640
It's not like a dank situation where I'm going to be like thrown away for speech or something,

07:25.440 --> 07:30.480
but there is something that I can't completely talk about. I know some people have learned some

07:30.480 --> 07:37.600
details, but there's more to it than I've even told them. And even though I can't say anything

07:37.600 --> 07:47.200
about it, it has occupied some time and made some things harder than they had to be. I'm sure I'll

07:47.200 --> 07:51.280
be able to talk to you about it at some point, sometime down the line. It'll definitely come up.

07:52.240 --> 07:58.320
In fact, Lilith has said she wanted to record a podcast on it because she personally found it so

07:58.960 --> 08:06.880
egregious. And I want to, but we have to wait. So yes, I'm back. If you see this video,

08:06.880 --> 08:13.520
that means that SFO has officially returned. I'm here. There will be videos. There will be

08:13.520 --> 08:18.800
more content. I'll be expanding some things. Maybe I'll do something approximating a regular book

08:18.800 --> 08:23.280
club. I've approached Lilith with the possibility of us doing regular streams.

08:24.480 --> 08:29.280
I'm going to figure a few things out, but the content to SFO is back.

08:29.920 --> 08:36.800
Now, if you want to ask some more details about this, when you see this video, I'm streaming.

08:36.800 --> 08:40.560
Again, it's over on Game Boomers. Game Boomers is kind of where I like to relax after the day's

08:40.560 --> 08:44.960
work. I'll go over there. I'll play some games. I'll usually talk with the chat room because

08:45.680 --> 08:52.080
on Game Boomers, there's maybe 50 viewers. On SFO, there's maybe 500 or sometimes more.

08:52.080 --> 08:57.440
So it's hard to answer every question on SFO, but on Game Boomers, generally I can relax with

08:57.440 --> 09:02.160
people and we can hang out. We can have a good time. It's not always going to be about questioning

09:02.160 --> 09:06.560
me because sometimes my friends are there. Sometimes we just, we crack jokes. Sometimes

09:06.560 --> 09:12.160
it's a comedy thing. Sometimes it's about me playing video games somewhat badly,

09:12.960 --> 09:17.040
but I think I'm pretty good. I think I'm pretty good. But the point is that it's a variety show.

09:17.040 --> 09:21.600
Politics is not banned, but it is a variety show. But when this video uploads, I'll be there. I'll

09:21.600 --> 09:26.640
be hanging out. I'll be talking with people who want to see what the details are, what's going

09:26.640 --> 09:33.280
on with the channel. I'll answer some questions and it will hopefully be a good time. So if you're

09:33.280 --> 09:38.960
watching this, go over there right now, twitch.tv slash Game Boomers and watch this channel because

09:39.440 --> 09:41.040
SFO content is coming soon.

09:43.760 --> 09:48.320
Oh, how soon do you ask? Well, here's the recording of the next video.

09:48.320 --> 09:51.280
I just got to edit it, so you'll see it tomorrow.
