0	4480	Oh boy, it's been a long time since I've been here, eh? At this point, I have been gone long enough
4480	8800	that you guys deserve to hear about what I've been doing, what I haven't been doing,
8800	13840	when I'm coming back, which by the way is right now, and what the plans are. So let's go over it.
13840	18400	Back during the first presidential debate, which was I think September 29th, 2020,
18960	24640	putting it nearly six months ago, jeez, time flies. I was streaming the debate with Scrump
24640	28320	and Arch Warhammer and a few other people, a few of my friends, Lilith was there,
28320	34800	and Scrump, being the naughty boy that he is, said the gamer words. Now, none of us knew this
34800	38560	at the time, but we were actually on the front page of YouTube, which is why we had I think
38560	46000	nearly 5,000 people watching. If you were to go to youtube.com and just go there logged out,
46000	49920	you would see my channel on the front. I was certainly getting more traffic than some of the
49920	55440	news network streams of the 2020 presidential debates, but being on the front page of YouTube,
55440	60400	combined with gamer words, combined with the fact that I am not one of those lucky pre-approved
60400	66240	progressive channels that YouTube likes to protect, well, I got demonetized. And yes,
66240	70640	through some people that know people and through some back alley stuff, I did eventually find out
70640	75360	that it was because of Scrump. So you can all go and yell at him if you like. But the point is,
75360	80240	I had at least a fair shot at getting demonetized. So I said, you know what? No,
80240	84720	I'm not going to work for free YouTube. I'm not just going to make videos and have you run ads
84720	89120	on them and then take all the revenue. I'm going to apply to get my monetization back,
89120	95200	which I did. It took until about mid January, but I did. And in the meantime, I'm going to do some
95200	100080	other things. I ordered some new artwork and I ordered some new music and I got to work on a
100080	105040	rebrand. I started re-uploading my backlog to other sites like Bitchute and Odyssey and others.
106080	110080	In fact, the only one that I kind of forgot about was Dailymotion. I'll get on that a bit.
110080	113600	Dailymotion kind of sucks though, because you can only really upload like five videos a day.
114320	118400	So to upload my entire backlog, it's going to take a while, you know? In the 11th hour,
118400	122240	it actually felt like I wasn't going to get my channel back. So I started another channel
122240	127520	called Devtrospective. And to be honest, I like the name enough that I might actually turn
128320	132960	this channel, Shrek Fight Otaku, into Devtrospective. Because frankly,
132960	138160	SFO, it's funny, but it doesn't really match what I do anymore. Like I still like anime.
138160	142800	I'm still short. I'm still fat. I'm still an otaku. But that name was picked before because
143840	148000	back in 2009 we were doing anime reviews, and we're not really doing that on this channel
148000	151840	anymore. So I'm not sure exactly what I want to do. Maybe the channel can be Devtrospective,
151840	156160	or the series can be Devtrospective, and SFO can be the person who does it. At the same time,
156800	160960	Dev is my name. I don't mind being called Dev at all. But that is where I've been.
161840	167600	And for the most part, it's been my side channel, my Game Boomers channel over on Twitch,
167600	173120	that has been keeping me afloat. And yes, Game Boomers is not nearly as successful as SFO right
173120	178400	now, but I treat it just as seriously. I stream there like five times a week, and I get enough
178400	182480	money to live. So it's pretty good, all things considered. By the way, if you haven't checked
182480	186320	it out yet, you should totally check it out, am I right? But this story doesn't account for
186320	192800	everything. Around late December, early January, my house had some renovations go on, and I found
192800	198000	myself unable to do anything. Unable to do any SFO recordings, even if I wanted to. Unable to do the
198000	202720	Game Boomers streams, because the room being renovated was literally the Game Boomers studio.
202720	209360	And then, in resetting up everything for Game Boomers, I didn't have the help that I thought
209360	213680	I would. I was expecting my roommate to be back at that time, he wasn't back from his travels yet,
213680	219280	so I had to kind of do it all myself. That added a few more days to the rebuilding of the studio.
219840	224560	Basically a bunch of things happened all at once, back in early January, that kept me from coming
224560	230400	back to Game Boomers until like the end of January. So for a good solid month there,
231360	234640	unless you were seeing me on Discord, like talking to the community a little bit,
235280	239680	I was gone. I was like, I was gone from the internet. And although Game Boomers, again,
239680	246720	is not as successful as SFO, the income that I get from it is more regular, and it is a little bit
246720	252000	easier to do. So my priority was getting that back up, just so I could have something while I
252000	259200	tried to rebuild SFO. While all this was going down, I realized I'd been watching a fair amount
259200	263840	of BreadTube. And guys, don't worry, I'm not a BreadTuber, I'm not a socialist, I'm not
263840	269920	interested in converting to those ideas at all. I will always be a liberal. A liberal the way that
269920	275360	it's supposed to be known as, not the way that Rush Limbaugh used it to describe a socialist.
275360	280480	No, no, no. I am a liberal. I am within the liberal tent of politics. I view what smooth
280480	286880	brains call the far left and the far right with an equal amount of disdain. But I realized that
286960	291200	there are a lot of liberal commentators who don't quite know what BreadTube believes,
291200	296160	or why they believe what they do. And I will say, after having watched a few months worth
296160	301680	of their content, I'm not convinced by anything that they've had to say. But at the very least,
302320	310160	I now know with more certainty why I oppose them. At this point, the only like lefty tubers
310160	317200	that I think have any kind of good arguments, or quality, or any kind of moral ground to stand on
317200	322800	whatsoever are probably like Destiny, who's not really considered a leftist, and ContraPoints.
322800	328240	That's it. Lindsay Ellis every once in a while, but everyone else just, they seem to be like,
329120	334400	they seem to be really hypocritical, and honestly pretty garbage. And we will be able to get into
334400	338800	why that is in the coming weeks as I make my return. Because at the same time, I've also been,
339440	346080	admittedly very slowly, chewing through a stack of interesting books that will help.
346080	352560	If there is one lesson that I've taken away from from Kraut, it's that when you have to argue your
352560	359120	position, don't do so on a live stream where charisma rules the day, where people are interested
359120	365360	in 30 second sound bites, and the crowd is only out for blood, not truth. Do so by reading,
365360	372080	and then presenting what you've learned in a logical, coherent way. And I think, among all of,
372080	376400	I don't know what you want to call it, like LibTube, I know Kraut hates LibTube, but among
376400	381520	all of liberal YouTube, Kraut is one of the better people at that for sure. And so is Sargon with his
381520	385760	book club. I know those two hate each other, it's like oil and water at this point, but they do seem
385760	391280	to be like the liberal and conservative side of the same coin. So I definitely appreciate both
391280	396080	their perspectives. Point is, I've been reading, and we will talk about the books again as the
396080	401200	weeks go on. And yes, at some point, I did just kind of get in my own head, you know?
401200	406480	I've described this multiple times over the years. Whenever you take a break, you feel like your
406480	411360	return has to be amazing and huge, and so you work on it, but then that work makes it take longer,
411360	415520	so then you feel like it has to be even bigger, and then you get into like a self-defeating spiral
415520	418480	when you're putting anything out. And I think it was a lot of people who said this, but I think it
418480	422320	was eventually ArchWarhammer who said, you know, just put something out. Put something out that's
422320	426800	bad. Put out a terrible video so that you're at least started again. And it's like, yeah,
426800	432720	fair enough. There's also one final topic that I can't completely cover because it is legal in
432720	438400	nature. This has been happening over the past week or two, I think. Don't worry, I'm fine.
440080	444640	It's not like a dank situation where I'm going to be like thrown away for speech or something,
445440	450480	but there is something that I can't completely talk about. I know some people have learned some
450480	457600	details, but there's more to it than I've even told them. And even though I can't say anything
457600	467200	about it, it has occupied some time and made some things harder than they had to be. I'm sure I'll
467200	471280	be able to talk to you about it at some point, sometime down the line. It'll definitely come up.
472240	478320	In fact, Lilith has said she wanted to record a podcast on it because she personally found it so
478960	486880	egregious. And I want to, but we have to wait. So yes, I'm back. If you see this video,
486880	493520	that means that SFO has officially returned. I'm here. There will be videos. There will be
493520	498800	more content. I'll be expanding some things. Maybe I'll do something approximating a regular book
498800	503280	club. I've approached Lilith with the possibility of us doing regular streams.
504480	509280	I'm going to figure a few things out, but the content to SFO is back.
509920	516800	Now, if you want to ask some more details about this, when you see this video, I'm streaming.
516800	520560	Again, it's over on Game Boomers. Game Boomers is kind of where I like to relax after the day's
520560	524960	work. I'll go over there. I'll play some games. I'll usually talk with the chat room because
525680	532080	on Game Boomers, there's maybe 50 viewers. On SFO, there's maybe 500 or sometimes more.
532080	537440	So it's hard to answer every question on SFO, but on Game Boomers, generally I can relax with
537440	542160	people and we can hang out. We can have a good time. It's not always going to be about questioning
542160	546560	me because sometimes my friends are there. Sometimes we just, we crack jokes. Sometimes
546560	552160	it's a comedy thing. Sometimes it's about me playing video games somewhat badly,
552960	557040	but I think I'm pretty good. I think I'm pretty good. But the point is that it's a variety show.
557040	561600	Politics is not banned, but it is a variety show. But when this video uploads, I'll be there. I'll
561600	566640	be hanging out. I'll be talking with people who want to see what the details are, what's going
566640	573280	on with the channel. I'll answer some questions and it will hopefully be a good time. So if you're
573280	578960	watching this, go over there right now, twitch.tv slash Game Boomers and watch this channel because
579440	581040	SFO content is coming soon.
583760	588320	Oh, how soon do you ask? Well, here's the recording of the next video.
588320	591280	I just got to edit it, so you'll see it tomorrow.
