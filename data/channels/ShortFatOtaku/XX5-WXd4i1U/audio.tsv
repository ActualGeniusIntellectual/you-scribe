0	9480	In the Lizofication video, I spoke about how I tend not to keep up with celebrities.
9480	10480	Well, you know what?
10480	12240	I don't really keep up with internet celebrities either.
12240	13240	Like, look at this.
13240	15040	Here's the banner for the Streamy Awards this year.
15040	17080	I don't know any of these guys.
17080	20160	Looking at this caption, I recognize MatPat, he's the Game Theory guy.
20160	23600	Dylan Mulvaney, since I did a previous video on the whole Bud Light thing.
23600	27520	I only know Rhett and Link because Dave soys out over them regularly.
27520	31120	I'm surprised Smosh is still around, and I know xQc due to my recent appearances on
31120	34680	eFAP and my coverage of the Twitch React meta, though to be honest, I've known about him
34680	35680	for longer than that.
35680	37720	But like, who the fuck are these people?
37720	38720	IconaPop?
38720	40720	BriannaChickenFry?
40720	42080	That's the name you chose?
42080	44720	I always feel strange when a list like this pops up.
44720	46240	Like the internet's kind of left me behind.
46240	49800	The former greats I used to look up to are mostly not so great anymore, both in terms
49800	53760	of them cucking out and disavowing all of their old content due to trolls remorse, and
53760	57180	in terms of them just being way less popular than when I was young.
57180	60700	The next generation has their own set of internet idols, and the old greats are just
60700	64180	kind of coasting by on their established fame, not really doing much anymore.
64180	68300	However, more and more have actually come to cherish not being in touch with things.
68300	70180	Not being on the bleeding edge, you know what I mean?
70180	74060	It's like the internet version of leaving behind the big city in the rat race, and retiring
74060	77040	to a midwestern estate to enjoy the slower pace.
77040	81380	In fact, I say, normalize not being plugged into the latest trends and events.
81380	86640	Haha, I managed to fit all five of YouTube's allowed other video advertisement cards into
86640	87640	the first two minutes.
87640	91840	Therefore, it should come as no surprise that before I started researching this video, I
91840	94600	had no idea of the Little Tay deep lore.
94600	97960	A couple of weeks ago, this was posted on Little Tay's Instagram, and subsequently
97960	98960	went viral.
98960	102780	It is with a heavy heart that we share the devastating news of our beloved Claire's
102780	104240	sudden and tragic passing.
104240	108160	We have no words to express the unbearable loss and indescribable pain.
108160	111520	This outcome was entirely unexpected, and has left us all in shock.
111520	115360	Her brother's passing adds an even more unimaginable depth to our grief.
115360	119960	During this time of immense sorrow, we kindly ask for privacy as we grieve the overwhelming
119960	123520	loss, as the circumstances surrounding Claire and her brother's passing are still under
123520	124520	investigation.
124520	128400	Claire will forever remain in our hearts, her absence leaving an irreplaceable void
128400	130560	that will be felt by all who knew and loved her.
130560	134160	Now, I had no idea what was going on, but I did remember the name, Little Tay, from
134160	136640	PewDiePie's YouTube Rewind of 2018.
136640	138320	Here was her tiny bit in that montage.
138320	140760	Y'all can't afford things like Little Tay.
140760	141760	I wears a belt.
141760	142760	Yeah, that's right.
142760	147460	In 2018, Little Tay was nine years old, and she was going viral for recording vlogs speaking
147460	152400	like a ghetto black rapper, waving money around, sitting in nice cars, showing off jewelry,
152400	154900	insulting the viewer, and even using slurs.
154900	159320	Big name YouTube channels back then were reacting to her taking off, most of them quite negatively,
159320	162040	remarking that she's only nine years old and why is she acting like this?
162040	163040	Where are her parents?
163040	164940	This is clearly going to fuck her up when she gets older.
164940	168480	And then she fell off my radar because I don't follow influencer news until that report of
168480	170120	her death from a couple weeks ago.
170120	174320	She'd be 14 or 15 at this point, and she apparently died under suspicious circumstances
174320	175680	along with her brother.
175680	179920	The place where my mind went first was to that stereotype of an overbearing parent of
179920	184240	a child star, where they push their kid to perform way beyond the line of abuse, and
184240	187560	then accidentally or maybe even intentionally end up killing them.
187560	189200	That was my initial reaction, anyway.
189200	191560	The outcry on the internet took two forms.
191560	193200	The first was like this person's.
193200	194400	Her name isn't Little Tay.
194400	195560	It was Claire Hope.
195560	200280	She was a little girl exploited and potentially abused by her family for fame, wealth, and
200280	201280	influence.
201280	206480	It's a shame that the vapid influencer persona will be her legacy when her life barely began.
206480	208440	Genuinely, rest in peace, Claire.
208440	212440	There's lots of sentiments like this, expressing sorrow over her death and laying the blame
212440	215880	at the feet of her parents for pushing her too far to be a young influencer.
215880	217920	Basically, this is my knee-jerk assumption.
217920	220120	The second form was this person's.
220120	224920	See, when you culturally appropriate black culture, you end up with worms and dirt.
224920	228600	What this person's referring to is the way Little Tay acted and spoke in those viral
228600	232440	2018 videos, using slurs and putting on an act of being ghetto.
232440	236600	Apparently, that justifies her death in the minds of these retards.
236600	241920	In fact, one specific poster who said this is a black Hollywood TV writer and comedian
241920	244980	who mentioned that she didn't care about Little Tay's possible death because she
244980	246880	dropped slurs at nine years old.
246880	247880	Like holy shit, dude.
247880	250960	I can't believe you're out here posting with your real name and your real face in
250960	254840	your whole LA career and your bio, talking about how you don't care about the possibility
254840	259240	a kid died because she dropped gamer words in her youthful ignorance.
259240	261400	This person has actual fucking brain rot.
261400	265160	In any case, the majority of posts about this event have since been deleted, including those
265160	267000	two main examples that I used.
267000	268000	That's why they look kind of weird.
268000	269700	I had to pull them off the internet archive.
269700	270720	Why were they deleted?
270720	273600	Because in the past couple of weeks, as more information came out, it turns out that this
273600	275760	whole thing is fake.
275760	279080	Never complain about me being late to the party ever again, guys.
279080	281360	The full story is never out on day one.
281360	284960	Actually, a lot of stuff still seems to be kind of unknown, but here's all the information
284960	285960	that I've gathered.
285960	289460	Despite it being commonly reported during the death hoax that Little Tay's real name
289460	294380	is Claire Hope, she actually told TMZ recently that her real name is Tay Tian.
294380	298040	Although a lot of her 2018 content revolved around her apparently growing up on the mean
298040	302160	streets of Atlanta, she actually grew up in Vancouver, Canada, with her half-brother Jason
302160	304240	Tian and her mother Angela Tian.
304240	307760	Her mother was a realtor, and a lot of the luxurious property Little Tay recorded her
307760	311580	videos and rap songs in were actually houses her mother was selling.
311580	315600	The most blatant example of her mother using her job for her daughter's online career
315600	319520	was when she borrowed her boss's sports car and shot a video with Little Tay sitting in
319520	321400	the front seat waving cash around.
321400	326060	In fact, it was this continuous use of Angela's client's property and her boss's property
326060	328200	that eventually led to her losing her job.
328200	332580	The Tian family seems to have moved to LA during the peak of Little Tay's virality.
332580	336480	She was influenced to the LA influencer scene, making connections with other content creators
336480	339700	and continuing to go viral with them, even flirting with the idea of signing with a talent
339700	340960	agency at some point.
340960	344760	Her father, back in Canada, Christopher Hope, was a Vancouver-based lawyer, and though he
344760	349120	was no longer in a relationship with Angela Tian, he did share custody of Tay.
349120	352420	Once he caught wind that his daughter was out of the country, he began legal proceedings
352420	355360	to bring her back to Canada, a process that took several months.
355360	359040	The date that Little Tay fell off of the collective internet's radar roughly lines up with the
359040	361720	date that Angela was forced to return her to Canada.
361720	365720	Her father's idea was to make his daughter's career more official, open a trust for her
365720	369740	income, open a business, trademark her brand, obtain a visa so that Tay could legally be
369740	373740	in the USA, and set up alternative schooling plans for a young person who was also working
373740	376320	in the media, none of which Angela had done.
376320	379760	She simply moved the family to America under the guise of going on a vacation and then
379760	381560	just began living there undercover.
381560	384840	So far, this story sounds like a classic case of the mother seeing her daughter's star
384840	388980	potential and going way too crazy with it, but it came out a few months after she initially
388980	392760	went viral that her half-brother also had a lot to do with what was going on.
392800	396640	While some people blamed Angela for allowing Tay to behave as she did, others began to
396640	400840	discover that it was actually her half-brother, Jason, who had control of the Little Tay social
400840	403800	media accounts, and it was him coaching her on what to say.
403800	408440	A leaked video posted by Keemstar on Twitter back in 2018 seems to confirm this.
452760	473680	Also, The Atlantic wrote in their article exposing Little Tay at the time, this testimonial.
473680	477840	I've seen Little Tay cry, said one person who had worked closely with Little Tay in
477840	481440	the past, but asked not to be identified by name for fear of jeopardizing their business
482440	484720	I've seen her brother shout at her.
484720	489160	Once Jason was yelling at her, saying, you're no good, it's no good, she was crying hard.
489160	492360	Anonymous sources aren't the best, but if this is true, that's pretty bad.
492360	494640	Wait a minute though, this old article was written by Taylor Lorenz.
494640	499640	Oh no, I can't do six YouTube cards and link back to my Taylor Lorenz video, fuck.
499640	502760	The fight between Tay's parents ended up ruining her career.
502760	507360	Angela wanted Tay to continue to make boisterous, outlandish content in an attempt to keep going
507360	511520	viral, while Christopher wanted Tay to move more into a traditional music career path
511520	513640	and pursue the rapper side of her shtick.
513640	518080	In June of 2018, several months after she first went viral, her online presence was
518080	520080	wiped clean in an attempted rebrand.
520080	525160	By October of 2018, her official accounts began posting stories of abuse by Tay's father.
525160	528640	Tay's mother denied that her brother posted these stories, and claimed that the account
528640	531480	was hacked and that she had contacted the police about it already.
531480	536080	By 2019, her brother had consolidated all control over Tay's social media, and by
536080	540920	2021, those same social media accounts began to claim abuse by Tay's father again, this
540920	543000	time dropping GoFundMe links.
543000	547160	Tay herself claimed this was a second hack, while Tay's agent, appointed by her father,
547160	551000	claimed that her mother and brother were trying to slander her father with abuse allegations
551000	553280	in order to bring Tay back under their thumb.
553280	557760	Shortly before the apparent death of little Tay and her brother, her YouTube bio was updated
557760	562400	to simply read, help me, and the same words were posted as an image on her Instagram account,
562400	565300	both of which had been inactive for nearly five years.
565300	566860	Then came that post about their death.
566860	569460	Here's what makes this story really fucking weird.
569460	573220	Variety asked little Tay's new management for a statement, and that management actually
573220	574620	confirmed her death.
574620	578020	Christopher, the father, was asked about it, and he didn't give a statement one way or
578020	579020	another.
579020	582540	Reporters asked both the Vancouver and LA police departments, neither of which had heard
582540	583540	anything.
583540	587020	TMZ finally managed to contact Tay directly, who confirmed that she and her brother were
587020	590740	alive and well, that her account had been hacked for a third time, and also to finally
590740	593860	confirm that her real name was not Claire Hope, but Tay Tian.
594220	597500	I'm going to give you my tinfoil hat theory as to what's going on here.
597500	600380	Obviously, the whole series of events is a fucking trash fire.
600380	603380	Mother and half-brother are fighting with the father over the direction of the daughter's
603380	604380	career.
604380	607580	And who knows if the daughter's interests or desires are being taken into account?
607580	608580	Probably not.
608580	611660	You've got multiple supposed hacking attempts, clear differences in how their daughter's
611660	612660	career should be managed.
612660	613920	It's just a whole mess.
613920	618140	The manager that Christopher hired, Harry Sang, seems to have some legal control over
618140	620380	Tay, and they move to make her career more official.
620900	624600	However, the mother has a different idea, and the half-brother controls all the accounts.
624600	629180	In response, the first two hackings happen, first in 2018 and second in 2021, alleging
629180	630460	abuse from the father.
630460	634460	To me, this seems like the mother and brother on one side trying to regain control over
634460	638340	Tay, since the brother owns the social media accounts, and Tay and her father on the other
638340	642580	side, with Tay's father appointing a manager, and the manager opposing the mother and brother.
642580	646220	However, by 2023, Harry Sang is no longer her manager.
646220	650260	He actually cut ties with the whole family two years earlier, and it's his belief that
650300	652300	the death hoax was simply a publicity stunt.
652300	656260	It's this fact, combined with the father simply going no comment, that makes it seem
656260	660380	to me like Tay's mother and brother ultimately won the battle against him, over who's going
660380	662380	to control Tay in her career.
662380	664460	Except at this point, Tay has no fucking career.
664460	667920	She was a flash in the pan five years ago, and the family bickering destroyed any shot
667920	671180	they had of positioning that properly, and springboarding into something more.
671180	674300	The more I researched the story, the more I was reminded of child actors who have their
674300	679500	lives fucking destroyed by their overzealous parents, child musicians or child performers,
679500	681340	or child reality TV stars.
681340	683980	What kind of life do you think those John and Kate plus eight kids are leading?
683980	685420	What about the Duggar kids?
685420	689100	One of them already got caught molesting his sisters and possessing child porn.
689100	693740	How many YouTube family prank channels have been busted for child abuse over the years,
693740	696900	where the kids were forced into it by their parents in order to go viral?
696900	698260	What can be done about this stuff?
698260	702380	Well, some people think that the way forward is to give child influencers the same legal
702380	706500	protections as child actors and child musicians, restricting how long they can work, legal
706500	710420	requirements to put away earnings into a trust for them to inherit when they turn 18,
710420	712820	basically protections to ensure that parents don't abuse their children.
712820	714500	This is probably a good idea.
714500	717620	Other people have asked how the line can be drawn between an underage viral influencer
717620	721500	whose accounts rake in the money versus somebody who posts a video of their kids onto YouTube
721500	724780	for their families, and they end up making like 50 cents in ad revenue or something.
724780	727300	However, I think we can handle those distinctions pretty well.
727300	730900	After all, child actor laws don't apply to the kid who acts in the school play, even
730900	733800	if grandma gives them the shiny nickel for their troubles.
733800	736680	Even then, what should be done about people who go viral when they're still underage
736680	738840	but old enough to not be totally retarded?
738840	741880	I'm talking about people who are in high school and manage their channels after school
741880	745880	on the weekend, like Scott the Woz, Kai Sinat, or Sneeko did back in the day.
745880	749360	Or until very recently, iShowSpeed.
749360	753000	When it comes to internet stuff, law tends to trail behind culture, and it seems a little
753000	757360	bit strange for a 15-year-old or a 16-year-old who makes his own YouTube videos and suddenly
757360	761920	goes viral to now have to submit to either his parents or child actor laws.
761920	765820	But maybe that's just how it has to be if we're going to avoid any more Lil Tay situations.
765820	768520	It might take 5 years, it might take 10, who knows.
768520	772000	But at some point, Lil Tay is going to come out as an adult and tell us the story of what
772000	773000	actually went on here.
773000	775340	And I have a suspicion it's probably something horrific.
775340	779500	The moral of the story is, if your kid goes viral online, that's cool.
779500	782000	But man, don't try to control it for them.
782000	783000	Let them do their thing.
783000	786800	Yeah, you can make sure they don't get catfished or get into an unsafe situation or something,
786800	788740	but blowing up on the internet is hard.
788740	793020	It happens to like one in a million, so don't ruin your kid's future for your present.
