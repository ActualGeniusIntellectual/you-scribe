00:00.000 --> 00:09.480
In the Lizofication video, I spoke about how I tend not to keep up with celebrities.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.480
Well, you know what?

00:10.480 --> 00:12.240
I don't really keep up with internet celebrities either.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.240
Like, look at this.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.040
Here's the banner for the Streamy Awards this year.

00:15.040 --> 00:17.080
I don't know any of these guys.

00:17.080 --> 00:20.160
Looking at this caption, I recognize MatPat, he's the Game Theory guy.

00:20.160 --> 00:23.600
Dylan Mulvaney, since I did a previous video on the whole Bud Light thing.

00:23.600 --> 00:27.520
I only know Rhett and Link because Dave soys out over them regularly.

00:27.520 --> 00:31.120
I'm surprised Smosh is still around, and I know xQc due to my recent appearances on

00:31.120 --> 00:34.680
eFAP and my coverage of the Twitch React meta, though to be honest, I've known about him

00:34.680 --> 00:35.680
for longer than that.

00:35.680 --> 00:37.720
But like, who the fuck are these people?

00:37.720 --> 00:38.720
IconaPop?

00:38.720 --> 00:40.720
BriannaChickenFry?

00:40.720 --> 00:42.080
That's the name you chose?

00:42.080 --> 00:44.720
I always feel strange when a list like this pops up.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.240
Like the internet's kind of left me behind.

00:46.240 --> 00:49.800
The former greats I used to look up to are mostly not so great anymore, both in terms

00:49.800 --> 00:53.760
of them cucking out and disavowing all of their old content due to trolls remorse, and

00:53.760 --> 00:57.180
in terms of them just being way less popular than when I was young.

00:57.180 --> 01:00.700
The next generation has their own set of internet idols, and the old greats are just

01:00.700 --> 01:04.180
kind of coasting by on their established fame, not really doing much anymore.

01:04.180 --> 01:08.300
However, more and more have actually come to cherish not being in touch with things.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.180
Not being on the bleeding edge, you know what I mean?

01:10.180 --> 01:14.060
It's like the internet version of leaving behind the big city in the rat race, and retiring

01:14.060 --> 01:17.040
to a midwestern estate to enjoy the slower pace.

01:17.040 --> 01:21.380
In fact, I say, normalize not being plugged into the latest trends and events.

01:21.380 --> 01:26.640
Haha, I managed to fit all five of YouTube's allowed other video advertisement cards into

01:26.640 --> 01:27.640
the first two minutes.

01:27.640 --> 01:31.840
Therefore, it should come as no surprise that before I started researching this video, I

01:31.840 --> 01:34.600
had no idea of the Little Tay deep lore.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.960
A couple of weeks ago, this was posted on Little Tay's Instagram, and subsequently

01:37.960 --> 01:38.960
went viral.

01:38.960 --> 01:42.780
It is with a heavy heart that we share the devastating news of our beloved Claire's

01:42.780 --> 01:44.240
sudden and tragic passing.

01:44.240 --> 01:48.160
We have no words to express the unbearable loss and indescribable pain.

01:48.160 --> 01:51.520
This outcome was entirely unexpected, and has left us all in shock.

01:51.520 --> 01:55.360
Her brother's passing adds an even more unimaginable depth to our grief.

01:55.360 --> 01:59.960
During this time of immense sorrow, we kindly ask for privacy as we grieve the overwhelming

01:59.960 --> 02:03.520
loss, as the circumstances surrounding Claire and her brother's passing are still under

02:03.520 --> 02:04.520
investigation.

02:04.520 --> 02:08.400
Claire will forever remain in our hearts, her absence leaving an irreplaceable void

02:08.400 --> 02:10.560
that will be felt by all who knew and loved her.

02:10.560 --> 02:14.160
Now, I had no idea what was going on, but I did remember the name, Little Tay, from

02:14.160 --> 02:16.640
PewDiePie's YouTube Rewind of 2018.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.320
Here was her tiny bit in that montage.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.760
Y'all can't afford things like Little Tay.

02:20.760 --> 02:21.760
I wears a belt.

02:21.760 --> 02:22.760
Yeah, that's right.

02:22.760 --> 02:27.460
In 2018, Little Tay was nine years old, and she was going viral for recording vlogs speaking

02:27.460 --> 02:32.400
like a ghetto black rapper, waving money around, sitting in nice cars, showing off jewelry,

02:32.400 --> 02:34.900
insulting the viewer, and even using slurs.

02:34.900 --> 02:39.320
Big name YouTube channels back then were reacting to her taking off, most of them quite negatively,

02:39.320 --> 02:42.040
remarking that she's only nine years old and why is she acting like this?

02:42.040 --> 02:43.040
Where are her parents?

02:43.040 --> 02:44.940
This is clearly going to fuck her up when she gets older.

02:44.940 --> 02:48.480
And then she fell off my radar because I don't follow influencer news until that report of

02:48.480 --> 02:50.120
her death from a couple weeks ago.

02:50.120 --> 02:54.320
She'd be 14 or 15 at this point, and she apparently died under suspicious circumstances

02:54.320 --> 02:55.680
along with her brother.

02:55.680 --> 02:59.920
The place where my mind went first was to that stereotype of an overbearing parent of

02:59.920 --> 03:04.240
a child star, where they push their kid to perform way beyond the line of abuse, and

03:04.240 --> 03:07.560
then accidentally or maybe even intentionally end up killing them.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.200
That was my initial reaction, anyway.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.560
The outcry on the internet took two forms.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.200
The first was like this person's.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.400
Her name isn't Little Tay.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.560
It was Claire Hope.

03:15.560 --> 03:20.280
She was a little girl exploited and potentially abused by her family for fame, wealth, and

03:20.280 --> 03:21.280
influence.

03:21.280 --> 03:26.480
It's a shame that the vapid influencer persona will be her legacy when her life barely began.

03:26.480 --> 03:28.440
Genuinely, rest in peace, Claire.

03:28.440 --> 03:32.440
There's lots of sentiments like this, expressing sorrow over her death and laying the blame

03:32.440 --> 03:35.880
at the feet of her parents for pushing her too far to be a young influencer.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.920
Basically, this is my knee-jerk assumption.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.120
The second form was this person's.

03:40.120 --> 03:44.920
See, when you culturally appropriate black culture, you end up with worms and dirt.

03:44.920 --> 03:48.600
What this person's referring to is the way Little Tay acted and spoke in those viral

03:48.600 --> 03:52.440
2018 videos, using slurs and putting on an act of being ghetto.

03:52.440 --> 03:56.600
Apparently, that justifies her death in the minds of these retards.

03:56.600 --> 04:01.920
In fact, one specific poster who said this is a black Hollywood TV writer and comedian

04:01.920 --> 04:04.980
who mentioned that she didn't care about Little Tay's possible death because she

04:04.980 --> 04:06.880
dropped slurs at nine years old.

04:06.880 --> 04:07.880
Like holy shit, dude.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.960
I can't believe you're out here posting with your real name and your real face in

04:10.960 --> 04:14.840
your whole LA career and your bio, talking about how you don't care about the possibility

04:14.840 --> 04:19.240
a kid died because she dropped gamer words in her youthful ignorance.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.400
This person has actual fucking brain rot.

04:21.400 --> 04:25.160
In any case, the majority of posts about this event have since been deleted, including those

04:25.160 --> 04:27.000
two main examples that I used.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
That's why they look kind of weird.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.700
I had to pull them off the internet archive.

04:29.700 --> 04:30.720
Why were they deleted?

04:30.720 --> 04:33.600
Because in the past couple of weeks, as more information came out, it turns out that this

04:33.600 --> 04:35.760
whole thing is fake.

04:35.760 --> 04:39.080
Never complain about me being late to the party ever again, guys.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.360
The full story is never out on day one.

04:41.360 --> 04:44.960
Actually, a lot of stuff still seems to be kind of unknown, but here's all the information

04:44.960 --> 04:45.960
that I've gathered.

04:45.960 --> 04:49.460
Despite it being commonly reported during the death hoax that Little Tay's real name

04:49.460 --> 04:54.380
is Claire Hope, she actually told TMZ recently that her real name is Tay Tian.

04:54.380 --> 04:58.040
Although a lot of her 2018 content revolved around her apparently growing up on the mean

04:58.040 --> 05:02.160
streets of Atlanta, she actually grew up in Vancouver, Canada, with her half-brother Jason

05:02.160 --> 05:04.240
Tian and her mother Angela Tian.

05:04.240 --> 05:07.760
Her mother was a realtor, and a lot of the luxurious property Little Tay recorded her

05:07.760 --> 05:11.580
videos and rap songs in were actually houses her mother was selling.

05:11.580 --> 05:15.600
The most blatant example of her mother using her job for her daughter's online career

05:15.600 --> 05:19.520
was when she borrowed her boss's sports car and shot a video with Little Tay sitting in

05:19.520 --> 05:21.400
the front seat waving cash around.

05:21.400 --> 05:26.060
In fact, it was this continuous use of Angela's client's property and her boss's property

05:26.060 --> 05:28.200
that eventually led to her losing her job.

05:28.200 --> 05:32.580
The Tian family seems to have moved to LA during the peak of Little Tay's virality.

05:32.580 --> 05:36.480
She was influenced to the LA influencer scene, making connections with other content creators

05:36.480 --> 05:39.700
and continuing to go viral with them, even flirting with the idea of signing with a talent

05:39.700 --> 05:40.960
agency at some point.

05:40.960 --> 05:44.760
Her father, back in Canada, Christopher Hope, was a Vancouver-based lawyer, and though he

05:44.760 --> 05:49.120
was no longer in a relationship with Angela Tian, he did share custody of Tay.

05:49.120 --> 05:52.420
Once he caught wind that his daughter was out of the country, he began legal proceedings

05:52.420 --> 05:55.360
to bring her back to Canada, a process that took several months.

05:55.360 --> 05:59.040
The date that Little Tay fell off of the collective internet's radar roughly lines up with the

05:59.040 --> 06:01.720
date that Angela was forced to return her to Canada.

06:01.720 --> 06:05.720
Her father's idea was to make his daughter's career more official, open a trust for her

06:05.720 --> 06:09.740
income, open a business, trademark her brand, obtain a visa so that Tay could legally be

06:09.740 --> 06:13.740
in the USA, and set up alternative schooling plans for a young person who was also working

06:13.740 --> 06:16.320
in the media, none of which Angela had done.

06:16.320 --> 06:19.760
She simply moved the family to America under the guise of going on a vacation and then

06:19.760 --> 06:21.560
just began living there undercover.

06:21.560 --> 06:24.840
So far, this story sounds like a classic case of the mother seeing her daughter's star

06:24.840 --> 06:28.980
potential and going way too crazy with it, but it came out a few months after she initially

06:28.980 --> 06:32.760
went viral that her half-brother also had a lot to do with what was going on.

06:32.800 --> 06:36.640
While some people blamed Angela for allowing Tay to behave as she did, others began to

06:36.640 --> 06:40.840
discover that it was actually her half-brother, Jason, who had control of the Little Tay social

06:40.840 --> 06:43.800
media accounts, and it was him coaching her on what to say.

06:43.800 --> 06:48.440
A leaked video posted by Keemstar on Twitter back in 2018 seems to confirm this.

07:32.760 --> 07:53.680
Also, The Atlantic wrote in their article exposing Little Tay at the time, this testimonial.

07:53.680 --> 07:57.840
I've seen Little Tay cry, said one person who had worked closely with Little Tay in

07:57.840 --> 08:01.440
the past, but asked not to be identified by name for fear of jeopardizing their business

08:02.440 --> 08:04.720
I've seen her brother shout at her.

08:04.720 --> 08:09.160
Once Jason was yelling at her, saying, you're no good, it's no good, she was crying hard.

08:09.160 --> 08:12.360
Anonymous sources aren't the best, but if this is true, that's pretty bad.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.640
Wait a minute though, this old article was written by Taylor Lorenz.

08:14.640 --> 08:19.640
Oh no, I can't do six YouTube cards and link back to my Taylor Lorenz video, fuck.

08:19.640 --> 08:22.760
The fight between Tay's parents ended up ruining her career.

08:22.760 --> 08:27.360
Angela wanted Tay to continue to make boisterous, outlandish content in an attempt to keep going

08:27.360 --> 08:31.520
viral, while Christopher wanted Tay to move more into a traditional music career path

08:31.520 --> 08:33.640
and pursue the rapper side of her shtick.

08:33.640 --> 08:38.080
In June of 2018, several months after she first went viral, her online presence was

08:38.080 --> 08:40.080
wiped clean in an attempted rebrand.

08:40.080 --> 08:45.160
By October of 2018, her official accounts began posting stories of abuse by Tay's father.

08:45.160 --> 08:48.640
Tay's mother denied that her brother posted these stories, and claimed that the account

08:48.640 --> 08:51.480
was hacked and that she had contacted the police about it already.

08:51.480 --> 08:56.080
By 2019, her brother had consolidated all control over Tay's social media, and by

08:56.080 --> 09:00.920
2021, those same social media accounts began to claim abuse by Tay's father again, this

09:00.920 --> 09:03.000
time dropping GoFundMe links.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.160
Tay herself claimed this was a second hack, while Tay's agent, appointed by her father,

09:07.160 --> 09:11.000
claimed that her mother and brother were trying to slander her father with abuse allegations

09:11.000 --> 09:13.280
in order to bring Tay back under their thumb.

09:13.280 --> 09:17.760
Shortly before the apparent death of little Tay and her brother, her YouTube bio was updated

09:17.760 --> 09:22.400
to simply read, help me, and the same words were posted as an image on her Instagram account,

09:22.400 --> 09:25.300
both of which had been inactive for nearly five years.

09:25.300 --> 09:26.860
Then came that post about their death.

09:26.860 --> 09:29.460
Here's what makes this story really fucking weird.

09:29.460 --> 09:33.220
Variety asked little Tay's new management for a statement, and that management actually

09:33.220 --> 09:34.620
confirmed her death.

09:34.620 --> 09:38.020
Christopher, the father, was asked about it, and he didn't give a statement one way or

09:38.020 --> 09:39.020
another.

09:39.020 --> 09:42.540
Reporters asked both the Vancouver and LA police departments, neither of which had heard

09:42.540 --> 09:43.540
anything.

09:43.540 --> 09:47.020
TMZ finally managed to contact Tay directly, who confirmed that she and her brother were

09:47.020 --> 09:50.740
alive and well, that her account had been hacked for a third time, and also to finally

09:50.740 --> 09:53.860
confirm that her real name was not Claire Hope, but Tay Tian.

09:54.220 --> 09:57.500
I'm going to give you my tinfoil hat theory as to what's going on here.

09:57.500 --> 10:00.380
Obviously, the whole series of events is a fucking trash fire.

10:00.380 --> 10:03.380
Mother and half-brother are fighting with the father over the direction of the daughter's

10:03.380 --> 10:04.380
career.

10:04.380 --> 10:07.580
And who knows if the daughter's interests or desires are being taken into account?

10:07.580 --> 10:08.580
Probably not.

10:08.580 --> 10:11.660
You've got multiple supposed hacking attempts, clear differences in how their daughter's

10:11.660 --> 10:12.660
career should be managed.

10:12.660 --> 10:13.920
It's just a whole mess.

10:13.920 --> 10:18.140
The manager that Christopher hired, Harry Sang, seems to have some legal control over

10:18.140 --> 10:20.380
Tay, and they move to make her career more official.

10:20.900 --> 10:24.600
However, the mother has a different idea, and the half-brother controls all the accounts.

10:24.600 --> 10:29.180
In response, the first two hackings happen, first in 2018 and second in 2021, alleging

10:29.180 --> 10:30.460
abuse from the father.

10:30.460 --> 10:34.460
To me, this seems like the mother and brother on one side trying to regain control over

10:34.460 --> 10:38.340
Tay, since the brother owns the social media accounts, and Tay and her father on the other

10:38.340 --> 10:42.580
side, with Tay's father appointing a manager, and the manager opposing the mother and brother.

10:42.580 --> 10:46.220
However, by 2023, Harry Sang is no longer her manager.

10:46.220 --> 10:50.260
He actually cut ties with the whole family two years earlier, and it's his belief that

10:50.300 --> 10:52.300
the death hoax was simply a publicity stunt.

10:52.300 --> 10:56.260
It's this fact, combined with the father simply going no comment, that makes it seem

10:56.260 --> 11:00.380
to me like Tay's mother and brother ultimately won the battle against him, over who's going

11:00.380 --> 11:02.380
to control Tay in her career.

11:02.380 --> 11:04.460
Except at this point, Tay has no fucking career.

11:04.460 --> 11:07.920
She was a flash in the pan five years ago, and the family bickering destroyed any shot

11:07.920 --> 11:11.180
they had of positioning that properly, and springboarding into something more.

11:11.180 --> 11:14.300
The more I researched the story, the more I was reminded of child actors who have their

11:14.300 --> 11:19.500
lives fucking destroyed by their overzealous parents, child musicians or child performers,

11:19.500 --> 11:21.340
or child reality TV stars.

11:21.340 --> 11:23.980
What kind of life do you think those John and Kate plus eight kids are leading?

11:23.980 --> 11:25.420
What about the Duggar kids?

11:25.420 --> 11:29.100
One of them already got caught molesting his sisters and possessing child porn.

11:29.100 --> 11:33.740
How many YouTube family prank channels have been busted for child abuse over the years,

11:33.740 --> 11:36.900
where the kids were forced into it by their parents in order to go viral?

11:36.900 --> 11:38.260
What can be done about this stuff?

11:38.260 --> 11:42.380
Well, some people think that the way forward is to give child influencers the same legal

11:42.380 --> 11:46.500
protections as child actors and child musicians, restricting how long they can work, legal

11:46.500 --> 11:50.420
requirements to put away earnings into a trust for them to inherit when they turn 18,

11:50.420 --> 11:52.820
basically protections to ensure that parents don't abuse their children.

11:52.820 --> 11:54.500
This is probably a good idea.

11:54.500 --> 11:57.620
Other people have asked how the line can be drawn between an underage viral influencer

11:57.620 --> 12:01.500
whose accounts rake in the money versus somebody who posts a video of their kids onto YouTube

12:01.500 --> 12:04.780
for their families, and they end up making like 50 cents in ad revenue or something.

12:04.780 --> 12:07.300
However, I think we can handle those distinctions pretty well.

12:07.300 --> 12:10.900
After all, child actor laws don't apply to the kid who acts in the school play, even

12:10.900 --> 12:13.800
if grandma gives them the shiny nickel for their troubles.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.680
Even then, what should be done about people who go viral when they're still underage

12:16.680 --> 12:18.840
but old enough to not be totally retarded?

12:18.840 --> 12:21.880
I'm talking about people who are in high school and manage their channels after school

12:21.880 --> 12:25.880
on the weekend, like Scott the Woz, Kai Sinat, or Sneeko did back in the day.

12:25.880 --> 12:29.360
Or until very recently, iShowSpeed.

12:29.360 --> 12:33.000
When it comes to internet stuff, law tends to trail behind culture, and it seems a little

12:33.000 --> 12:37.360
bit strange for a 15-year-old or a 16-year-old who makes his own YouTube videos and suddenly

12:37.360 --> 12:41.920
goes viral to now have to submit to either his parents or child actor laws.

12:41.920 --> 12:45.820
But maybe that's just how it has to be if we're going to avoid any more Lil Tay situations.

12:45.820 --> 12:48.520
It might take 5 years, it might take 10, who knows.

12:48.520 --> 12:52.000
But at some point, Lil Tay is going to come out as an adult and tell us the story of what

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
actually went on here.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.340
And I have a suspicion it's probably something horrific.

12:55.340 --> 12:59.500
The moral of the story is, if your kid goes viral online, that's cool.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.000
But man, don't try to control it for them.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Let them do their thing.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.800
Yeah, you can make sure they don't get catfished or get into an unsafe situation or something,

13:06.800 --> 13:08.740
but blowing up on the internet is hard.

13:08.740 --> 13:13.020
It happens to like one in a million, so don't ruin your kid's future for your present.
