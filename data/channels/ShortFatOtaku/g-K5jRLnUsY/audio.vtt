Hey guys, got an announcement for you.

00:01.560 --> 00:03.280
You got a crust hanging off your lip.

00:03.280 --> 00:06.400
So for everyone who watches this for Gamergate, this is good news for you.

00:06.400 --> 00:11.600
I did an interview, a four part interview with Paper Mario about all things related

00:11.600 --> 00:12.600
to Gamergate.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.680
It was a lot of fun.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.960
It's kind of noteworthy because he is a subscriber.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.600
What are you coughing about?

00:17.600 --> 00:19.080
His name isn't Paper Mario.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.880
Oh shit, it's Photo Mario.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.640
Oh my fucking god!

00:23.640 --> 00:29.960
Everyone just looks up Paper Mario.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.840
It's just one of those games.

00:32.840 --> 00:38.800
So I did a series of Gamergate interviews with Proto Mario and it was actually really

00:38.800 --> 00:45.400
cool and we talked about all things Gamergate over a course of like four parts of videos.

00:45.400 --> 00:50.640
It's actually kind of noteworthy because he is a YouTuber with like 250,000 subscribers

00:50.640 --> 00:55.040
and he does have an open letter to anybody who's in Gamergate or even opposed to it to

00:55.040 --> 00:56.480
go over and talk to him.

00:56.480 --> 01:00.600
He'll listen to pretty much every side of it and just give everyone publication just

01:00.600 --> 01:02.600
to kind of talk about the issues.

01:02.600 --> 01:06.840
So if you want to go see my interview, you can go check out the link.

01:06.840 --> 01:14.160
If you want to go talk to him, he's more than willing to talk to anybody so go have some

01:14.160 --> 01:16.440
ethics.

01:16.440 --> 01:22.200
And as for our next Gamergate video, it is coming in a few days so come say hi when that

01:22.200 --> 01:24.200
comes out.

01:24.200 --> 01:29.760
Are you like just eating shit in bed last night?

01:29.760 --> 01:32.680
Eating like some ghetto nachos or some KFCs?

01:32.680 --> 01:35.680
Again dude, my lips are really chapped.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.680
Yeah, so is your asshole.

01:37.680 --> 01:41.800
I know, that's why I've got to put chapstick on though and then put it back.

01:41.800 --> 01:47.120
Man, when someone actually says like the expression chapped asshole, do they actually like, they

01:47.120 --> 01:50.600
just like a dry asshole that just cracks when you take a shit?

01:50.600 --> 01:53.600
Are we talking about the literal meme or the textual meme?

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
I don't know, whatever.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.160
I'd deliver a lot of those because people say that, like it's actually the thing they're

01:58.160 --> 01:59.160
comparing it to.

01:59.160 --> 02:02.720
I think it's just like just dried, like red.

02:02.720 --> 02:05.720
So do you like, do you like chapstick your asshole?

02:05.720 --> 02:06.720
I don't think so.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.760
I think you just let it in the store.

02:08.760 --> 02:12.720
Is there asshole chapstick that you could like put on it?

02:12.720 --> 02:14.720
Operation Age.

02:14.720 --> 02:15.720
Oh, Anosol!

02:15.720 --> 02:17.720
Anosol is an actual thing?

02:17.720 --> 02:18.720
Yeah, it is.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.720
It's a legitimate thing.

02:20.840 --> 02:22.840
Okay, well, let's try it, Dave.

02:22.840 --> 02:23.840
Together.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.840
You want to like share a stick of it?

02:27.840 --> 02:30.840
Oh my god, I'm so wrong on so many levels.
