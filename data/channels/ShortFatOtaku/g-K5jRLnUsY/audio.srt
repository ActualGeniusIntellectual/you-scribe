00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
Hey guys, got an announcement for you.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,280
You got a crust hanging off your lip.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,400
So for everyone who watches this for Gamergate, this is good news for you.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,600
I did an interview, a four part interview with Paper Mario about all things related

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,600
to Gamergate.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,680
It was a lot of fun.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,960
It's kind of noteworthy because he is a subscriber.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,600
What are you coughing about?

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,080
His name isn't Paper Mario.

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,880
Oh shit, it's Photo Mario.

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,640
Oh my fucking god!

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,960
Everyone just looks up Paper Mario.

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,840
It's just one of those games.

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,800
So I did a series of Gamergate interviews with Proto Mario and it was actually really

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,400
cool and we talked about all things Gamergate over a course of like four parts of videos.

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,640
It's actually kind of noteworthy because he is a YouTuber with like 250,000 subscribers

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,040
and he does have an open letter to anybody who's in Gamergate or even opposed to it to

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,480
go over and talk to him.

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,600
He'll listen to pretty much every side of it and just give everyone publication just

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
to kind of talk about the issues.

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,840
So if you want to go see my interview, you can go check out the link.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:14,160
If you want to go talk to him, he's more than willing to talk to anybody so go have some

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,440
ethics.

24
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:22,200
And as for our next Gamergate video, it is coming in a few days so come say hi when that

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
comes out.

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,760
Are you like just eating shit in bed last night?

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,680
Eating like some ghetto nachos or some KFCs?

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,680
Again dude, my lips are really chapped.

29
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,680
Yeah, so is your asshole.

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,800
I know, that's why I've got to put chapstick on though and then put it back.

31
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,120
Man, when someone actually says like the expression chapped asshole, do they actually like, they

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,600
just like a dry asshole that just cracks when you take a shit?

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Are we talking about the literal meme or the textual meme?

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't know, whatever.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,160
I'd deliver a lot of those because people say that, like it's actually the thing they're

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
comparing it to.

37
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,720
I think it's just like just dried, like red.

38
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,720
So do you like, do you like chapstick your asshole?

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
I don't think so.

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,760
I think you just let it in the store.

41
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,720
Is there asshole chapstick that you could like put on it?

42
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,720
Operation Age.

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
Oh, Anosol!

44
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,720
Anosol is an actual thing?

45
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,720
Yeah, it is.

46
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
It's a legitimate thing.

47
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,840
Okay, well, let's try it, Dave.

48
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Together.

49
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,840
You want to like share a stick of it?

50
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,840
Oh my god, I'm so wrong on so many levels.
