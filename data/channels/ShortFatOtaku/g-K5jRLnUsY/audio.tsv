0	1560	Hey guys, got an announcement for you.
1560	3280	You got a crust hanging off your lip.
3280	6400	So for everyone who watches this for Gamergate, this is good news for you.
6400	11600	I did an interview, a four part interview with Paper Mario about all things related
11600	12600	to Gamergate.
12600	13680	It was a lot of fun.
13680	15960	It's kind of noteworthy because he is a subscriber.
15960	17600	What are you coughing about?
17600	19080	His name isn't Paper Mario.
19080	20880	Oh shit, it's Photo Mario.
20880	23640	Oh my fucking god!
23640	29960	Everyone just looks up Paper Mario.
29960	32840	It's just one of those games.
32840	38800	So I did a series of Gamergate interviews with Proto Mario and it was actually really
38800	45400	cool and we talked about all things Gamergate over a course of like four parts of videos.
45400	50640	It's actually kind of noteworthy because he is a YouTuber with like 250,000 subscribers
50640	55040	and he does have an open letter to anybody who's in Gamergate or even opposed to it to
55040	56480	go over and talk to him.
56480	60600	He'll listen to pretty much every side of it and just give everyone publication just
60600	62600	to kind of talk about the issues.
62600	66840	So if you want to go see my interview, you can go check out the link.
66840	74160	If you want to go talk to him, he's more than willing to talk to anybody so go have some
74160	76440	ethics.
76440	82200	And as for our next Gamergate video, it is coming in a few days so come say hi when that
82200	84200	comes out.
84200	89760	Are you like just eating shit in bed last night?
89760	92680	Eating like some ghetto nachos or some KFCs?
92680	95680	Again dude, my lips are really chapped.
95680	97680	Yeah, so is your asshole.
97680	101800	I know, that's why I've got to put chapstick on though and then put it back.
101800	107120	Man, when someone actually says like the expression chapped asshole, do they actually like, they
107120	110600	just like a dry asshole that just cracks when you take a shit?
110600	113600	Are we talking about the literal meme or the textual meme?
114000	115000	I don't know, whatever.
115000	118160	I'd deliver a lot of those because people say that, like it's actually the thing they're
118160	119160	comparing it to.
119160	122720	I think it's just like just dried, like red.
122720	125720	So do you like, do you like chapstick your asshole?
125720	126720	I don't think so.
126720	128760	I think you just let it in the store.
128760	132720	Is there asshole chapstick that you could like put on it?
132720	134720	Operation Age.
134720	135720	Oh, Anosol!
135720	137720	Anosol is an actual thing?
137720	138720	Yeah, it is.
138720	140720	It's a legitimate thing.
140840	142840	Okay, well, let's try it, Dave.
142840	143840	Together.
143840	147840	You want to like share a stick of it?
147840	150840	Oh my god, I'm so wrong on so many levels.
