0	10080	Boy, me doing this video has a reasonably high chance that it's going to blow up right
10080	11080	in my face.
11080	13520	PayPal, if you're listening, I just want you to know that this is coming from a place
13520	14520	of love, pal.
14520	18200	I really do want to see you improve, you're so convenient everyone uses you, but your
18200	21020	behavior has left a lot to be desired.
21020	23400	Please don't ban me for honest criticism, okay?
23400	27380	Also, if they do, please consider supporting me on Subscribestar, which processes payouts
27380	28700	without using PayPal.
28700	31580	The cut they take is less than YouTube, Twitch or Patreon as well.
31580	36020	$5 a month on any of those platforms get you into the D-Club, my exclusive supporter-only
36020	38620	Discord, but really, Subscribestar is the best bet.
38620	43040	PayPal's reputation is as one of those ubiquitous internet services that was born out of the
43040	45700	boom of the late 90s and early 2000s.
45700	49660	And as it is so often the case with internet companies, early adopters become today's
49660	50660	monopolies.
50660	52240	That's not a hard and fast rule, of course.
52240	56500	Reddit replaced Digg, Google replaced Yahoo, Facebook replaced Myspace.
56500	60760	But for the most part, internet users don't actually have any loyalty towards a platform.
60760	62420	They go where people already are.
62420	65780	Because overwhelmingly, the product offered on the internet is the attention of others.
65780	71060	This is why, without some massive disruption, Bitchute, Rumble or Odyssey will never dethrone
71060	72220	YouTube or Twitch.
72220	75220	Gab, Parler or Getter will never dethrone Twitter.
75220	78540	Subscribestar will never dethrone Patreon, even though I'd like it to.
78540	81260	And you know, are there even any PayPal alternatives?
81260	84160	Well, if there are, they probably won't dethrone PayPal.
84160	87820	These alternative sites don't add anything new to the user experience.
87820	90920	They're literally the same service with less people on it.
90920	94180	And when it comes to ease of use, really, nothing beats PayPal.
94180	96600	Those two qualities form a feedback loop.
96600	98680	Ease of use leads to more people using PayPal.
98680	101120	More people using PayPal contributes to ease of use.
101120	105040	Of course, monopolies tend to become corrupted over time, without any competition pressure
105040	106260	to keep them on their toes.
106260	107460	And PayPal is no different.
107460	111680	PayPal has a history of playing fast and loose with liberal ideas, like freedom of expression
111680	112680	or privacy rights.
112720	116760	Now, I want to make it clear that, as a private entity, PayPal has their own freedom of expression
116760	118000	and privacy rights.
118000	121500	And forcing them to platform your speech that they don't agree with is a violation of
121500	122680	their rights, too.
122680	125980	We can critique PayPal for deplatforming people on political grounds.
125980	128180	We can even stop using their service for it.
128180	130200	But they are within their rights to do it.
130200	132120	Nonetheless, let's see what they've done.
132120	136920	PayPal's first real controversy of this nature was back in 2011, when PayPal, Amazon,
136920	141880	Visa and Mastercard all, at the same time, dropped WikiLeaks in response to their December
141880	143680	2010 diplomatic cables dump.
143680	149480	PayPal was actually DDoSed by Anonymous at the time, and 13 of the infamous PayPal14
149480	153640	Anonymous members ended up pleading guilty to charges of damaging a protected computer
153640	157280	and felony conspiracy in a California court on December of 2013.
157280	161840	In 2018, PayPal cancelled accounts associated with Gavin McInnis, the Proud Boys movement,
161840	165860	and several Antifa groups, showing that they were going after radicals on both sides and
165860	167720	not simply being partisans.
167720	170200	A PayPal statement on the bannings said,
170200	174180	Striking the necessary balance between upholding free expression and open dialogue and protecting
174180	178800	principles of tolerance, diversity, and respect for all people is a challenge that many companies
178800	180000	are grappling with today.
180000	184040	We work hard to achieve the right balance and to ensure our decisions are values-driven
184040	185300	and not political.
185300	187800	We carefully review accounts and take action as appropriate.
187800	191960	We do not allow PayPal services to be used to promote hate, violence, or other forms
191960	193840	of intolerance that are discriminatory.
193840	196200	In 2019, though, things were shifting.
196200	201320	PayPal banned Infowars and Gab, who, unlike the Proud Boys, aren't the inverted, right-wing
201320	203120	street thug equivalent of Antifa.
203120	207040	Alex Jones and Andrew Torba are inflammatory, but not violent.
207040	211080	PayPal claimed that Infowars promoted hatred and intolerance, while Gab was banned because
211080	214800	the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter had made anti-Semitic posts on the service.
214800	218840	That sounds suspicious to me, because the Christchurch shooting was streamed on Facebook,
218840	221280	and yet that platform still has access to PayPal.
221280	225280	Reddit, Twitter, all of mainstream tech has, at some point, hosted a video of a shooting
225280	230260	or a manifesto or hateful messages, and yet PayPal still serves them, making the Gab claim
230260	231560	ring hollow.
231560	233520	After that, it seemed like the floodgates had opened.
233520	237240	Laura Loomer, Tommy Robinson, and Roosh V all got axed from PayPal.
237240	239320	All three of them are inflammatory, but not violent.
239320	243320	Robert Spencer, Pamela Geller, and The Daily Septic were all banned, but thankfully won
243320	244440	on appeal.
244440	247720	SubscribeStar and Bitchute were both removed from the service, with Bitchute supporters
247720	252520	receiving an email from PayPal implying that Bitchute had cancelled their use of the service,
252520	254600	when it was, in fact, a PayPal ban.
254600	258960	Many other smaller groups and individuals have been unceremoniously thrown off the service,
258960	260800	to no fanfare, because nobody knows about it.
260800	265560	It even got to the point where PayPal banned porn from their service in 2020, with multiple
265560	270380	small artists and creators losing their accounts and sometimes even their account balances.
270380	274680	Even PornHub stopped taking PayPal too, now only accepting payment in crypto.
274680	277720	In fact, that whole losing their account balances thing?
277720	279680	That was the subject of a recent controversy.
279680	284180	PayPal's new acceptable use policy went viral last November, where it was noticed
284180	289240	by people that they claimed the right to withdraw $2,500 from your account if you violate the
289240	290560	acceptable use policy.
290560	294040	Here's what wasn't talked about regarding that story, though.
294040	298320	This policy has actually been in place for a while, long before it went viral.
298320	300960	Here is the text of the PayPal acceptable use policy.
300960	304180	You may not use the PayPal service for activities that 1.
304180	307020	Violate any law, statute, ordinance, or regulation.
307020	310800	This is already troubling to me, because other jurisdictions have wacky laws that I shouldn't
310800	311800	be subject to.
311800	312800	I don't live there.
312800	313800	2.
313800	317600	Relating to transactions involving narcotics, steroids, drugs, cigarettes, promoting illegal
317600	319100	activity, stolen goods.
319100	323360	This is all pretty normal stuff until we get to items that are considered obscene and certain
323360	327360	sexually-oriented materials and services, which are both way too vague, but basically
327360	329280	this is PayPal covering its ass.
329280	330280	3.
330600	334400	Relating to transactions that show the personal information of third parties, aka doxing,
334400	337880	supporting pyramid schemes or Ponzi schemes, association with offshore banking, for the
337880	341000	sale of items that you don't own but expect to own in the future.
341000	342000	Insurance stuff.
342000	344320	This is all just, you can't do shady stuff on PayPal.
344320	345560	Okay, got it.
345560	346560	4.
346560	349660	Involving the sale of products or services identified by government agencies to have
349660	351600	a high likelihood of being fraudulent.
351600	352600	5.
352600	356200	Relating to transactions involving any activity that requires pre-approval without having
356200	357840	obtained the approval.
357840	362120	If you violate any of these rules, you're subject to PayPal's restricted activities
362120	365860	penalties where they say that they can kick you off PayPal, they can keep you banned off
365860	369680	PayPal indefinitely, they can restrict your access to their websites and networks, they
369680	374280	can hold your PayPal balance for 180 days while they determine if your account has any
374280	377680	debts that need to be paid, they can contact people you have bought and sold from, they
377680	382160	can take legal action against you if applicable, and important to this conversation, they can
382160	384240	withdraw damages from your account.
384240	389440	The policy says, if your violation is associated with fraud or the sale of goods that are counterfeit,
389440	391480	then you're on the hook for PayPal's damages.
391480	396320	You agree, by using the PayPal service, that considering PayPal needs to pay for internal
396320	400680	administrative costs to monitor and track violations, pay for damages to the brand and
400680	405520	reputation of PayPal, and pay costs imposed upon it by PayPal's business partners as
405520	409480	a result of your fraud, that you need to pay for all of these costs.
409480	414040	And that 2,500 US dollars, it's also 2,500 Canadian dollars, which is odd considering
414040	415040	the exchange rate.
415040	416840	I guess if you're going to break the law, do it in Canada.
416840	422560	But the idea is that 2,500 US dollars is the average cost of all of these impositions.
422560	427840	Your penalty may be less or more than 2,500 depending on the severity of the violation,
427840	430680	and that PayPal can directly withdraw the penalty from your account.
430680	431860	None of this is new.
431860	436140	What is new, and what made this whole thing go viral in the first place, was when, on
436140	442420	November 3rd, 2022, back on that five-point list, they moved 0.5 to 0.6 and inserted a
442420	447740	new 0.5, which read, involving the sending, posting, or publication of any messages, content,
447740	454340	or materials, that, in PayPal's sole discretion, A, are harmful, obscene, harassing, or objectionable,
454340	459360	B, depict or appear to depict nudity, sexual, or other intimate activities, C, depict or
459360	464660	promote illegal drug use, D, depict or promote violence, criminal activity, cruelty, or self-harm,
464660	470500	E, depict, promote, or incite hatred or discrimination of protected groups or of individuals or groups
470500	475180	based on protected characteristics, example, race, religion, gender or gender identity,
475180	481140	sexual orientation, etc., F, present a risk to user safety or well-being, G, are fraudulent,
481140	485740	promote misinformation, or are unlawful, H, infringe the privacy, intellectual property
485740	491060	rights, or other proprietary rights of any party, or I, are otherwise unfit for publication.
491060	495780	This new policy is significantly more vague and restricting than even the vaguest parts
495780	498620	of the old policy, and this is what made everyone freak out.
498620	503140	PayPal was going to charge you $2,500 for misinformation, and they were the ones who
503140	505180	got to decide what misinformation was.
505180	508340	That's not the only objectionable thing, though, considering how puritanical that whole
508340	512240	section was, but it's the misinformation part that went viral.
512240	515940	After the backlash, PayPal pulled the new policy and reverted to what they had in place
515940	516940	before.
516940	520940	In fact, there's even reports that PayPal was offering people $15 to not close their
520940	525020	accounts after people began to leave PayPal, which is, not going to lie, pretty funny.
525020	526400	Here's the issue, though.
526400	530340	After the story died down and the news cycle moved on, right-leaning accounts on Twitter
530340	535980	began to claim that PayPal had quietly snuck back in the $2,500 penalty now that the outrage
535980	539980	had passed, and people began to react with, I knew it, they were always going to do this,
539980	541960	they were just going to wait until we weren't looking anymore.
541960	543940	But that's actually not the case.
543940	548060	If you go to PayPal's acceptable use policy right now, you'll notice that the new Section
548060	550240	5 is, in fact, not there.
550240	554800	The page is exactly as it was pre-November 3, with no section on misinformation.
554800	559240	And the page showing the punishments for violating this acceptable use policy is also exactly
559240	564980	as it was pre-November 3, with the possibility of a $2,500 fine still there, as it had been
564980	566180	for years.
566180	570980	It turns out, PayPal retaining the right to reach into your account and take $2,500 if
570980	575200	you violate the acceptable use policy has been there since 2015.
575200	580240	PayPal did not sneak the $2,500 clause back in after people stopped paying attention.
580240	584540	It's been there all along, they just didn't implement the new, more restrictive Section
584540	585540	5 rules.
585540	589080	And those rules are still gone, even though people have stopped paying attention.
589080	595140	Meaning, no, you're not going to get charged $2,500 for misinformation, where misinformation
595140	597820	is defined by PayPal at their sole discretion.
597820	600320	The question remains though, why is all of this happening?
600320	603520	What the hell has changed since the Elon Musk days of PayPal?
603520	607340	The current CEO of PayPal, Dan Shulman, gave an interview with the Wall Street Journal
607340	611240	in 2019, talking about why some people get banned and others don't.
611240	615280	He cited Charlottesville as a defining moment for him, where he knew that PayPal had to
615280	616280	change.
616280	620560	He said, the line between free speech and hate isn't taught in college, and it's
620560	624760	not defined in the law, and he believes that businesses need to be a force for good in
624760	626320	the values they believe in.
626320	631520	As for what values are the most core to PayPal, Shulman said diversity and inclusion, of course,
631520	636000	and that he chose to make a visible stand and cancel expansion plans in North Carolina
636000	641040	after that state passed a bill making it mandatory for people to use the bathroom of their biological
641040	642040	sex.
642040	645920	He also made it clear that the Southern Poverty Law Center helps inform PayPal's decisions
645920	651000	on these matters, and in 2021, further partnered with the Anti-Defamation League to help identify
651000	653760	extremist content flowing through PayPal.
653760	658320	It seems to be the attitude of Dan Shulman specifically that's driving a lot of this
658320	659320	stuff.
659320	663160	When PayPal split off from eBay and became its own company in 2015, Shulman was brought
663160	664400	on to take the reins.
664400	669480	PayPal's initial goal was to facilitate easy payments online in the face of a then-new
669480	670480	internet marketplace.
670480	671480	That's it.
671480	676760	But Shulman, after taking power, said publicly, that ship has sailed, that era of PayPal is
676760	677760	over.
677760	680960	I think stepping into the role when I did was certainly a historic moment for PayPal.
680960	684260	I thought when we became an independent company, it would give us a chance to reimagine the
684260	685640	company moving forward.
685640	689340	The new mission of PayPal became democratizing access to money.
689340	693040	On the face of it, that just sounds like more people having access to online finance.
693040	698080	But the word democratizing is used specifically here, to appeal to a majority rule.
698080	702120	A fully democratized money system means that other people get to vote on how you spend
702120	705120	your money, because a democratized system is not a private one.
705120	709900	Shulman refers to all of this as financial inclusion, a topic I went over extensively
709900	712480	in my video a few years back on MasterCard.
712820	714800	It's all about getting more people into the system.
714800	717360	And fair enough, because that added accessibility is pretty good.
717360	721660	But the trade-off is that unlike with cash, your money is now controlled by the service
721660	726440	that you're using, and PayPal isn't shy about wielding that power in a partisan way.
726440	730480	Like I said before, PayPal is a private entity, and Shulman is a private individual.
730480	734520	They have the right to be partisan leftoids and partner with partisan leftoid activist
734520	735840	groups if they want.
735840	740720	But because PayPal holds an effective monopoly right now, there is a very strong moral argument
740720	745600	that either PayPal needs to be made to serve everyone equally regardless of political slant,
745600	749720	accepting of course for money that's actually directly being used to fund violent action,
749720	753840	and then let the political chips fall where they may, or there needs to be an actual market
753840	755320	competitor to PayPal.
755320	760500	And considering how, back when Sargon was banned from Patreon and moved over to Subscribestar,
760500	765160	everyone pulled out a Subscribestar in response including PayPal, they clearly have no intention
765160	767800	of letting an actual competitor organically grow.
767800	772060	This is one of those times where government regulation of PayPal is required to maintain
772060	776400	a level playing field, because PayPal seems to be too partisan right now to serve people
776400	777800	equally of its own volition.
