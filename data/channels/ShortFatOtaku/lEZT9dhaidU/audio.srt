1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,080
Boy, me doing this video has a reasonably high chance that it's going to blow up right

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,080
in my face.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,520
PayPal, if you're listening, I just want you to know that this is coming from a place

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,520
of love, pal.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,200
I really do want to see you improve, you're so convenient everyone uses you, but your

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,020
behavior has left a lot to be desired.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,400
Please don't ban me for honest criticism, okay?

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,380
Also, if they do, please consider supporting me on Subscribestar, which processes payouts

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,700
without using PayPal.

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,580
The cut they take is less than YouTube, Twitch or Patreon as well.

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,020
$5 a month on any of those platforms get you into the D-Club, my exclusive supporter-only

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,620
Discord, but really, Subscribestar is the best bet.

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,040
PayPal's reputation is as one of those ubiquitous internet services that was born out of the

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,700
boom of the late 90s and early 2000s.

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,660
And as it is so often the case with internet companies, early adopters become today's

16
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,660
monopolies.

17
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,240
That's not a hard and fast rule, of course.

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,500
Reddit replaced Digg, Google replaced Yahoo, Facebook replaced Myspace.

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,760
But for the most part, internet users don't actually have any loyalty towards a platform.

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,420
They go where people already are.

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,780
Because overwhelmingly, the product offered on the internet is the attention of others.

22
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,060
This is why, without some massive disruption, Bitchute, Rumble or Odyssey will never dethrone

23
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,220
YouTube or Twitch.

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,220
Gab, Parler or Getter will never dethrone Twitter.

25
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,540
Subscribestar will never dethrone Patreon, even though I'd like it to.

26
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,260
And you know, are there even any PayPal alternatives?

27
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,160
Well, if there are, they probably won't dethrone PayPal.

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,820
These alternative sites don't add anything new to the user experience.

29
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,920
They're literally the same service with less people on it.

30
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,180
And when it comes to ease of use, really, nothing beats PayPal.

31
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,600
Those two qualities form a feedback loop.

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,680
Ease of use leads to more people using PayPal.

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,120
More people using PayPal contributes to ease of use.

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,040
Of course, monopolies tend to become corrupted over time, without any competition pressure

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,260
to keep them on their toes.

36
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,460
And PayPal is no different.

37
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,680
PayPal has a history of playing fast and loose with liberal ideas, like freedom of expression

38
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
or privacy rights.

39
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,760
Now, I want to make it clear that, as a private entity, PayPal has their own freedom of expression

40
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,000
and privacy rights.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,500
And forcing them to platform your speech that they don't agree with is a violation of

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,680
their rights, too.

43
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,980
We can critique PayPal for deplatforming people on political grounds.

44
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,180
We can even stop using their service for it.

45
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,200
But they are within their rights to do it.

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,120
Nonetheless, let's see what they've done.

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,920
PayPal's first real controversy of this nature was back in 2011, when PayPal, Amazon,

48
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,880
Visa and Mastercard all, at the same time, dropped WikiLeaks in response to their December

49
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,680
2010 diplomatic cables dump.

50
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,480
PayPal was actually DDoSed by Anonymous at the time, and 13 of the infamous PayPal14

51
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,640
Anonymous members ended up pleading guilty to charges of damaging a protected computer

52
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,280
and felony conspiracy in a California court on December of 2013.

53
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,840
In 2018, PayPal cancelled accounts associated with Gavin McInnis, the Proud Boys movement,

54
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,860
and several Antifa groups, showing that they were going after radicals on both sides and

55
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,720
not simply being partisans.

56
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,200
A PayPal statement on the bannings said,

57
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,180
Striking the necessary balance between upholding free expression and open dialogue and protecting

58
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,800
principles of tolerance, diversity, and respect for all people is a challenge that many companies

59
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,000
are grappling with today.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,040
We work hard to achieve the right balance and to ensure our decisions are values-driven

61
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,300
and not political.

62
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,800
We carefully review accounts and take action as appropriate.

63
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,960
We do not allow PayPal services to be used to promote hate, violence, or other forms

64
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,840
of intolerance that are discriminatory.

65
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,200
In 2019, though, things were shifting.

66
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,320
PayPal banned Infowars and Gab, who, unlike the Proud Boys, aren't the inverted, right-wing

67
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,120
street thug equivalent of Antifa.

68
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,040
Alex Jones and Andrew Torba are inflammatory, but not violent.

69
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,080
PayPal claimed that Infowars promoted hatred and intolerance, while Gab was banned because

70
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,800
the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter had made anti-Semitic posts on the service.

71
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,840
That sounds suspicious to me, because the Christchurch shooting was streamed on Facebook,

72
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,280
and yet that platform still has access to PayPal.

73
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,280
Reddit, Twitter, all of mainstream tech has, at some point, hosted a video of a shooting

74
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,260
or a manifesto or hateful messages, and yet PayPal still serves them, making the Gab claim

75
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,560
ring hollow.

76
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,520
After that, it seemed like the floodgates had opened.

77
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,240
Laura Loomer, Tommy Robinson, and Roosh V all got axed from PayPal.

78
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,320
All three of them are inflammatory, but not violent.

79
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,320
Robert Spencer, Pamela Geller, and The Daily Septic were all banned, but thankfully won

80
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,440
on appeal.

81
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,720
SubscribeStar and Bitchute were both removed from the service, with Bitchute supporters

82
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,520
receiving an email from PayPal implying that Bitchute had cancelled their use of the service,

83
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,600
when it was, in fact, a PayPal ban.

84
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,960
Many other smaller groups and individuals have been unceremoniously thrown off the service,

85
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,800
to no fanfare, because nobody knows about it.

86
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,560
It even got to the point where PayPal banned porn from their service in 2020, with multiple

87
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,380
small artists and creators losing their accounts and sometimes even their account balances.

88
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,680
Even PornHub stopped taking PayPal too, now only accepting payment in crypto.

89
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,720
In fact, that whole losing their account balances thing?

90
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,680
That was the subject of a recent controversy.

91
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,180
PayPal's new acceptable use policy went viral last November, where it was noticed

92
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,240
by people that they claimed the right to withdraw $2,500 from your account if you violate the

93
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,560
acceptable use policy.

94
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,040
Here's what wasn't talked about regarding that story, though.

95
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,320
This policy has actually been in place for a while, long before it went viral.

96
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,960
Here is the text of the PayPal acceptable use policy.

97
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,180
You may not use the PayPal service for activities that 1.

98
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,020
Violate any law, statute, ordinance, or regulation.

99
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,800
This is already troubling to me, because other jurisdictions have wacky laws that I shouldn't

100
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
be subject to.

101
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
I don't live there.

102
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
2.

103
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,600
Relating to transactions involving narcotics, steroids, drugs, cigarettes, promoting illegal

104
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,100
activity, stolen goods.

105
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,360
This is all pretty normal stuff until we get to items that are considered obscene and certain

106
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,360
sexually-oriented materials and services, which are both way too vague, but basically

107
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,280
this is PayPal covering its ass.

108
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
3.

109
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,400
Relating to transactions that show the personal information of third parties, aka doxing,

110
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,880
supporting pyramid schemes or Ponzi schemes, association with offshore banking, for the

111
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,000
sale of items that you don't own but expect to own in the future.

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Insurance stuff.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,320
This is all just, you can't do shady stuff on PayPal.

114
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,560
Okay, got it.

115
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
4.

116
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,660
Involving the sale of products or services identified by government agencies to have

117
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,600
a high likelihood of being fraudulent.

118
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
5.

119
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,200
Relating to transactions involving any activity that requires pre-approval without having

120
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,840
obtained the approval.

121
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,120
If you violate any of these rules, you're subject to PayPal's restricted activities

122
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,860
penalties where they say that they can kick you off PayPal, they can keep you banned off

123
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,680
PayPal indefinitely, they can restrict your access to their websites and networks, they

124
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,280
can hold your PayPal balance for 180 days while they determine if your account has any

125
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,680
debts that need to be paid, they can contact people you have bought and sold from, they

126
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,160
can take legal action against you if applicable, and important to this conversation, they can

127
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,240
withdraw damages from your account.

128
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,440
The policy says, if your violation is associated with fraud or the sale of goods that are counterfeit,

129
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,480
then you're on the hook for PayPal's damages.

130
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:36,320
You agree, by using the PayPal service, that considering PayPal needs to pay for internal

131
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,680
administrative costs to monitor and track violations, pay for damages to the brand and

132
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,520
reputation of PayPal, and pay costs imposed upon it by PayPal's business partners as

133
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,480
a result of your fraud, that you need to pay for all of these costs.

134
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,040
And that 2,500 US dollars, it's also 2,500 Canadian dollars, which is odd considering

135
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
the exchange rate.

136
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,840
I guess if you're going to break the law, do it in Canada.

137
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,560
But the idea is that 2,500 US dollars is the average cost of all of these impositions.

138
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,840
Your penalty may be less or more than 2,500 depending on the severity of the violation,

139
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,680
and that PayPal can directly withdraw the penalty from your account.

140
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,860
None of this is new.

141
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,140
What is new, and what made this whole thing go viral in the first place, was when, on

142
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:22,420
November 3rd, 2022, back on that five-point list, they moved 0.5 to 0.6 and inserted a

143
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,740
new 0.5, which read, involving the sending, posting, or publication of any messages, content,

144
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:34,340
or materials, that, in PayPal's sole discretion, A, are harmful, obscene, harassing, or objectionable,

145
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,360
B, depict or appear to depict nudity, sexual, or other intimate activities, C, depict or

146
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,660
promote illegal drug use, D, depict or promote violence, criminal activity, cruelty, or self-harm,

147
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:50,500
E, depict, promote, or incite hatred or discrimination of protected groups or of individuals or groups

148
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,180
based on protected characteristics, example, race, religion, gender or gender identity,

149
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:01,140
sexual orientation, etc., F, present a risk to user safety or well-being, G, are fraudulent,

150
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,740
promote misinformation, or are unlawful, H, infringe the privacy, intellectual property

151
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:11,060
rights, or other proprietary rights of any party, or I, are otherwise unfit for publication.

152
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,780
This new policy is significantly more vague and restricting than even the vaguest parts

153
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,620
of the old policy, and this is what made everyone freak out.

154
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,140
PayPal was going to charge you $2,500 for misinformation, and they were the ones who

155
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,180
got to decide what misinformation was.

156
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,340
That's not the only objectionable thing, though, considering how puritanical that whole

157
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,240
section was, but it's the misinformation part that went viral.

158
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,940
After the backlash, PayPal pulled the new policy and reverted to what they had in place

159
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,940
before.

160
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,940
In fact, there's even reports that PayPal was offering people $15 to not close their

161
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,020
accounts after people began to leave PayPal, which is, not going to lie, pretty funny.

162
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,400
Here's the issue, though.

163
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,340
After the story died down and the news cycle moved on, right-leaning accounts on Twitter

164
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,980
began to claim that PayPal had quietly snuck back in the $2,500 penalty now that the outrage

165
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,980
had passed, and people began to react with, I knew it, they were always going to do this,

166
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,960
they were just going to wait until we weren't looking anymore.

167
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,940
But that's actually not the case.

168
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,060
If you go to PayPal's acceptable use policy right now, you'll notice that the new Section

169
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,240
5 is, in fact, not there.

170
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,800
The page is exactly as it was pre-November 3, with no section on misinformation.

171
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,240
And the page showing the punishments for violating this acceptable use policy is also exactly

172
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,980
as it was pre-November 3, with the possibility of a $2,500 fine still there, as it had been

173
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,180
for years.

174
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,980
It turns out, PayPal retaining the right to reach into your account and take $2,500 if

175
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,200
you violate the acceptable use policy has been there since 2015.

176
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,240
PayPal did not sneak the $2,500 clause back in after people stopped paying attention.

177
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,540
It's been there all along, they just didn't implement the new, more restrictive Section

178
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,540
5 rules.

179
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,080
And those rules are still gone, even though people have stopped paying attention.

180
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:55,140
Meaning, no, you're not going to get charged $2,500 for misinformation, where misinformation

181
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,820
is defined by PayPal at their sole discretion.

182
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,320
The question remains though, why is all of this happening?

183
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,520
What the hell has changed since the Elon Musk days of PayPal?

184
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,340
The current CEO of PayPal, Dan Shulman, gave an interview with the Wall Street Journal

185
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,240
in 2019, talking about why some people get banned and others don't.

186
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,280
He cited Charlottesville as a defining moment for him, where he knew that PayPal had to

187
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280
change.

188
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,560
He said, the line between free speech and hate isn't taught in college, and it's

189
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,760
not defined in the law, and he believes that businesses need to be a force for good in

190
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,320
the values they believe in.

191
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,520
As for what values are the most core to PayPal, Shulman said diversity and inclusion, of course,

192
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,000
and that he chose to make a visible stand and cancel expansion plans in North Carolina

193
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,040
after that state passed a bill making it mandatory for people to use the bathroom of their biological

194
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
sex.

195
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,920
He also made it clear that the Southern Poverty Law Center helps inform PayPal's decisions

196
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,000
on these matters, and in 2021, further partnered with the Anti-Defamation League to help identify

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,760
extremist content flowing through PayPal.

198
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,320
It seems to be the attitude of Dan Shulman specifically that's driving a lot of this

199
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,320
stuff.

200
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,160
When PayPal split off from eBay and became its own company in 2015, Shulman was brought

201
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,400
on to take the reins.

202
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,480
PayPal's initial goal was to facilitate easy payments online in the face of a then-new

203
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,480
internet marketplace.

204
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
That's it.

205
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,760
But Shulman, after taking power, said publicly, that ship has sailed, that era of PayPal is

206
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
over.

207
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,960
I think stepping into the role when I did was certainly a historic moment for PayPal.

208
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,260
I thought when we became an independent company, it would give us a chance to reimagine the

209
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,640
company moving forward.

210
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,340
The new mission of PayPal became democratizing access to money.

211
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,040
On the face of it, that just sounds like more people having access to online finance.

212
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,080
But the word democratizing is used specifically here, to appeal to a majority rule.

213
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,120
A fully democratized money system means that other people get to vote on how you spend

214
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,120
your money, because a democratized system is not a private one.

215
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,900
Shulman refers to all of this as financial inclusion, a topic I went over extensively

216
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,480
in my video a few years back on MasterCard.

217
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,800
It's all about getting more people into the system.

218
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,360
And fair enough, because that added accessibility is pretty good.

219
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,660
But the trade-off is that unlike with cash, your money is now controlled by the service

220
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,440
that you're using, and PayPal isn't shy about wielding that power in a partisan way.

221
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,480
Like I said before, PayPal is a private entity, and Shulman is a private individual.

222
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,520
They have the right to be partisan leftoids and partner with partisan leftoid activist

223
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,840
groups if they want.

224
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,720
But because PayPal holds an effective monopoly right now, there is a very strong moral argument

225
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,600
that either PayPal needs to be made to serve everyone equally regardless of political slant,

226
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,720
accepting of course for money that's actually directly being used to fund violent action,

227
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,840
and then let the political chips fall where they may, or there needs to be an actual market

228
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,320
competitor to PayPal.

229
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,500
And considering how, back when Sargon was banned from Patreon and moved over to Subscribestar,

230
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,160
everyone pulled out a Subscribestar in response including PayPal, they clearly have no intention

231
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,800
of letting an actual competitor organically grow.

232
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,060
This is one of those times where government regulation of PayPal is required to maintain

233
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,400
a level playing field, because PayPal seems to be too partisan right now to serve people

234
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,800
equally of its own volition.
