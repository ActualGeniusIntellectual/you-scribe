WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.080
Boy, me doing this video has a reasonably high chance that it's going to blow up right

00:10.080 --> 00:11.080
in my face.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.520
PayPal, if you're listening, I just want you to know that this is coming from a place

00:13.520 --> 00:14.520
of love, pal.

00:14.520 --> 00:18.200
I really do want to see you improve, you're so convenient everyone uses you, but your

00:18.200 --> 00:21.020
behavior has left a lot to be desired.

00:21.020 --> 00:23.400
Please don't ban me for honest criticism, okay?

00:23.400 --> 00:27.380
Also, if they do, please consider supporting me on Subscribestar, which processes payouts

00:27.380 --> 00:28.700
without using PayPal.

00:28.700 --> 00:31.580
The cut they take is less than YouTube, Twitch or Patreon as well.

00:31.580 --> 00:36.020
$5 a month on any of those platforms get you into the D-Club, my exclusive supporter-only

00:36.020 --> 00:38.620
Discord, but really, Subscribestar is the best bet.

00:38.620 --> 00:43.040
PayPal's reputation is as one of those ubiquitous internet services that was born out of the

00:43.040 --> 00:45.700
boom of the late 90s and early 2000s.

00:45.700 --> 00:49.660
And as it is so often the case with internet companies, early adopters become today's

00:49.660 --> 00:50.660
monopolies.

00:50.660 --> 00:52.240
That's not a hard and fast rule, of course.

00:52.240 --> 00:56.500
Reddit replaced Digg, Google replaced Yahoo, Facebook replaced Myspace.

00:56.500 --> 01:00.760
But for the most part, internet users don't actually have any loyalty towards a platform.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.420
They go where people already are.

01:02.420 --> 01:05.780
Because overwhelmingly, the product offered on the internet is the attention of others.

01:05.780 --> 01:11.060
This is why, without some massive disruption, Bitchute, Rumble or Odyssey will never dethrone

01:11.060 --> 01:12.220
YouTube or Twitch.

01:12.220 --> 01:15.220
Gab, Parler or Getter will never dethrone Twitter.

01:15.220 --> 01:18.540
Subscribestar will never dethrone Patreon, even though I'd like it to.

01:18.540 --> 01:21.260
And you know, are there even any PayPal alternatives?

01:21.260 --> 01:24.160
Well, if there are, they probably won't dethrone PayPal.

01:24.160 --> 01:27.820
These alternative sites don't add anything new to the user experience.

01:27.820 --> 01:30.920
They're literally the same service with less people on it.

01:30.920 --> 01:34.180
And when it comes to ease of use, really, nothing beats PayPal.

01:34.180 --> 01:36.600
Those two qualities form a feedback loop.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.680
Ease of use leads to more people using PayPal.

01:38.680 --> 01:41.120
More people using PayPal contributes to ease of use.

01:41.120 --> 01:45.040
Of course, monopolies tend to become corrupted over time, without any competition pressure

01:45.040 --> 01:46.260
to keep them on their toes.

01:46.260 --> 01:47.460
And PayPal is no different.

01:47.460 --> 01:51.680
PayPal has a history of playing fast and loose with liberal ideas, like freedom of expression

01:51.680 --> 01:52.680
or privacy rights.

01:52.720 --> 01:56.760
Now, I want to make it clear that, as a private entity, PayPal has their own freedom of expression

01:56.760 --> 01:58.000
and privacy rights.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.500
And forcing them to platform your speech that they don't agree with is a violation of

02:01.500 --> 02:02.680
their rights, too.

02:02.680 --> 02:05.980
We can critique PayPal for deplatforming people on political grounds.

02:05.980 --> 02:08.180
We can even stop using their service for it.

02:08.180 --> 02:10.200
But they are within their rights to do it.

02:10.200 --> 02:12.120
Nonetheless, let's see what they've done.

02:12.120 --> 02:16.920
PayPal's first real controversy of this nature was back in 2011, when PayPal, Amazon,

02:16.920 --> 02:21.880
Visa and Mastercard all, at the same time, dropped WikiLeaks in response to their December

02:21.880 --> 02:23.680
2010 diplomatic cables dump.

02:23.680 --> 02:29.480
PayPal was actually DDoSed by Anonymous at the time, and 13 of the infamous PayPal14

02:29.480 --> 02:33.640
Anonymous members ended up pleading guilty to charges of damaging a protected computer

02:33.640 --> 02:37.280
and felony conspiracy in a California court on December of 2013.

02:37.280 --> 02:41.840
In 2018, PayPal cancelled accounts associated with Gavin McInnis, the Proud Boys movement,

02:41.840 --> 02:45.860
and several Antifa groups, showing that they were going after radicals on both sides and

02:45.860 --> 02:47.720
not simply being partisans.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.200
A PayPal statement on the bannings said,

02:50.200 --> 02:54.180
Striking the necessary balance between upholding free expression and open dialogue and protecting

02:54.180 --> 02:58.800
principles of tolerance, diversity, and respect for all people is a challenge that many companies

02:58.800 --> 03:00.000
are grappling with today.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.040
We work hard to achieve the right balance and to ensure our decisions are values-driven

03:04.040 --> 03:05.300
and not political.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.800
We carefully review accounts and take action as appropriate.

03:07.800 --> 03:11.960
We do not allow PayPal services to be used to promote hate, violence, or other forms

03:11.960 --> 03:13.840
of intolerance that are discriminatory.

03:13.840 --> 03:16.200
In 2019, though, things were shifting.

03:16.200 --> 03:21.320
PayPal banned Infowars and Gab, who, unlike the Proud Boys, aren't the inverted, right-wing

03:21.320 --> 03:23.120
street thug equivalent of Antifa.

03:23.120 --> 03:27.040
Alex Jones and Andrew Torba are inflammatory, but not violent.

03:27.040 --> 03:31.080
PayPal claimed that Infowars promoted hatred and intolerance, while Gab was banned because

03:31.080 --> 03:34.800
the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter had made anti-Semitic posts on the service.

03:34.800 --> 03:38.840
That sounds suspicious to me, because the Christchurch shooting was streamed on Facebook,

03:38.840 --> 03:41.280
and yet that platform still has access to PayPal.

03:41.280 --> 03:45.280
Reddit, Twitter, all of mainstream tech has, at some point, hosted a video of a shooting

03:45.280 --> 03:50.260
or a manifesto or hateful messages, and yet PayPal still serves them, making the Gab claim

03:50.260 --> 03:51.560
ring hollow.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.520
After that, it seemed like the floodgates had opened.

03:53.520 --> 03:57.240
Laura Loomer, Tommy Robinson, and Roosh V all got axed from PayPal.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.320
All three of them are inflammatory, but not violent.

03:59.320 --> 04:03.320
Robert Spencer, Pamela Geller, and The Daily Septic were all banned, but thankfully won

04:03.320 --> 04:04.440
on appeal.

04:04.440 --> 04:07.720
SubscribeStar and Bitchute were both removed from the service, with Bitchute supporters

04:07.720 --> 04:12.520
receiving an email from PayPal implying that Bitchute had cancelled their use of the service,

04:12.520 --> 04:14.600
when it was, in fact, a PayPal ban.

04:14.600 --> 04:18.960
Many other smaller groups and individuals have been unceremoniously thrown off the service,

04:18.960 --> 04:20.800
to no fanfare, because nobody knows about it.

04:20.800 --> 04:25.560
It even got to the point where PayPal banned porn from their service in 2020, with multiple

04:25.560 --> 04:30.380
small artists and creators losing their accounts and sometimes even their account balances.

04:30.380 --> 04:34.680
Even PornHub stopped taking PayPal too, now only accepting payment in crypto.

04:34.680 --> 04:37.720
In fact, that whole losing their account balances thing?

04:37.720 --> 04:39.680
That was the subject of a recent controversy.

04:39.680 --> 04:44.180
PayPal's new acceptable use policy went viral last November, where it was noticed

04:44.180 --> 04:49.240
by people that they claimed the right to withdraw $2,500 from your account if you violate the

04:49.240 --> 04:50.560
acceptable use policy.

04:50.560 --> 04:54.040
Here's what wasn't talked about regarding that story, though.

04:54.040 --> 04:58.320
This policy has actually been in place for a while, long before it went viral.

04:58.320 --> 05:00.960
Here is the text of the PayPal acceptable use policy.

05:00.960 --> 05:04.180
You may not use the PayPal service for activities that 1.

05:04.180 --> 05:07.020
Violate any law, statute, ordinance, or regulation.

05:07.020 --> 05:10.800
This is already troubling to me, because other jurisdictions have wacky laws that I shouldn't

05:10.800 --> 05:11.800
be subject to.

05:11.800 --> 05:12.800
I don't live there.

05:12.800 --> 05:13.800
2.

05:13.800 --> 05:17.600
Relating to transactions involving narcotics, steroids, drugs, cigarettes, promoting illegal

05:17.600 --> 05:19.100
activity, stolen goods.

05:19.100 --> 05:23.360
This is all pretty normal stuff until we get to items that are considered obscene and certain

05:23.360 --> 05:27.360
sexually-oriented materials and services, which are both way too vague, but basically

05:27.360 --> 05:29.280
this is PayPal covering its ass.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.280
3.

05:30.600 --> 05:34.400
Relating to transactions that show the personal information of third parties, aka doxing,

05:34.400 --> 05:37.880
supporting pyramid schemes or Ponzi schemes, association with offshore banking, for the

05:37.880 --> 05:41.000
sale of items that you don't own but expect to own in the future.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Insurance stuff.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.320
This is all just, you can't do shady stuff on PayPal.

05:44.320 --> 05:45.560
Okay, got it.

05:45.560 --> 05:46.560
4.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.660
Involving the sale of products or services identified by government agencies to have

05:49.660 --> 05:51.600
a high likelihood of being fraudulent.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.600
5.

05:52.600 --> 05:56.200
Relating to transactions involving any activity that requires pre-approval without having

05:56.200 --> 05:57.840
obtained the approval.

05:57.840 --> 06:02.120
If you violate any of these rules, you're subject to PayPal's restricted activities

06:02.120 --> 06:05.860
penalties where they say that they can kick you off PayPal, they can keep you banned off

06:05.860 --> 06:09.680
PayPal indefinitely, they can restrict your access to their websites and networks, they

06:09.680 --> 06:14.280
can hold your PayPal balance for 180 days while they determine if your account has any

06:14.280 --> 06:17.680
debts that need to be paid, they can contact people you have bought and sold from, they

06:17.680 --> 06:22.160
can take legal action against you if applicable, and important to this conversation, they can

06:22.160 --> 06:24.240
withdraw damages from your account.

06:24.240 --> 06:29.440
The policy says, if your violation is associated with fraud or the sale of goods that are counterfeit,

06:29.440 --> 06:31.480
then you're on the hook for PayPal's damages.

06:31.480 --> 06:36.320
You agree, by using the PayPal service, that considering PayPal needs to pay for internal

06:36.320 --> 06:40.680
administrative costs to monitor and track violations, pay for damages to the brand and

06:40.680 --> 06:45.520
reputation of PayPal, and pay costs imposed upon it by PayPal's business partners as

06:45.520 --> 06:49.480
a result of your fraud, that you need to pay for all of these costs.

06:49.480 --> 06:54.040
And that 2,500 US dollars, it's also 2,500 Canadian dollars, which is odd considering

06:54.040 --> 06:55.040
the exchange rate.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.840
I guess if you're going to break the law, do it in Canada.

06:56.840 --> 07:02.560
But the idea is that 2,500 US dollars is the average cost of all of these impositions.

07:02.560 --> 07:07.840
Your penalty may be less or more than 2,500 depending on the severity of the violation,

07:07.840 --> 07:10.680
and that PayPal can directly withdraw the penalty from your account.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.860
None of this is new.

07:11.860 --> 07:16.140
What is new, and what made this whole thing go viral in the first place, was when, on

07:16.140 --> 07:22.420
November 3rd, 2022, back on that five-point list, they moved 0.5 to 0.6 and inserted a

07:22.420 --> 07:27.740
new 0.5, which read, involving the sending, posting, or publication of any messages, content,

07:27.740 --> 07:34.340
or materials, that, in PayPal's sole discretion, A, are harmful, obscene, harassing, or objectionable,

07:34.340 --> 07:39.360
B, depict or appear to depict nudity, sexual, or other intimate activities, C, depict or

07:39.360 --> 07:44.660
promote illegal drug use, D, depict or promote violence, criminal activity, cruelty, or self-harm,

07:44.660 --> 07:50.500
E, depict, promote, or incite hatred or discrimination of protected groups or of individuals or groups

07:50.500 --> 07:55.180
based on protected characteristics, example, race, religion, gender or gender identity,

07:55.180 --> 08:01.140
sexual orientation, etc., F, present a risk to user safety or well-being, G, are fraudulent,

08:01.140 --> 08:05.740
promote misinformation, or are unlawful, H, infringe the privacy, intellectual property

08:05.740 --> 08:11.060
rights, or other proprietary rights of any party, or I, are otherwise unfit for publication.

08:11.060 --> 08:15.780
This new policy is significantly more vague and restricting than even the vaguest parts

08:15.780 --> 08:18.620
of the old policy, and this is what made everyone freak out.

08:18.620 --> 08:23.140
PayPal was going to charge you $2,500 for misinformation, and they were the ones who

08:23.140 --> 08:25.180
got to decide what misinformation was.

08:25.180 --> 08:28.340
That's not the only objectionable thing, though, considering how puritanical that whole

08:28.340 --> 08:32.240
section was, but it's the misinformation part that went viral.

08:32.240 --> 08:35.940
After the backlash, PayPal pulled the new policy and reverted to what they had in place

08:35.940 --> 08:36.940
before.

08:36.940 --> 08:40.940
In fact, there's even reports that PayPal was offering people $15 to not close their

08:40.940 --> 08:45.020
accounts after people began to leave PayPal, which is, not going to lie, pretty funny.

08:45.020 --> 08:46.400
Here's the issue, though.

08:46.400 --> 08:50.340
After the story died down and the news cycle moved on, right-leaning accounts on Twitter

08:50.340 --> 08:55.980
began to claim that PayPal had quietly snuck back in the $2,500 penalty now that the outrage

08:55.980 --> 08:59.980
had passed, and people began to react with, I knew it, they were always going to do this,

08:59.980 --> 09:01.960
they were just going to wait until we weren't looking anymore.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.940
But that's actually not the case.

09:03.940 --> 09:08.060
If you go to PayPal's acceptable use policy right now, you'll notice that the new Section

09:08.060 --> 09:10.240
5 is, in fact, not there.

09:10.240 --> 09:14.800
The page is exactly as it was pre-November 3, with no section on misinformation.

09:14.800 --> 09:19.240
And the page showing the punishments for violating this acceptable use policy is also exactly

09:19.240 --> 09:24.980
as it was pre-November 3, with the possibility of a $2,500 fine still there, as it had been

09:24.980 --> 09:26.180
for years.

09:26.180 --> 09:30.980
It turns out, PayPal retaining the right to reach into your account and take $2,500 if

09:30.980 --> 09:35.200
you violate the acceptable use policy has been there since 2015.

09:35.200 --> 09:40.240
PayPal did not sneak the $2,500 clause back in after people stopped paying attention.

09:40.240 --> 09:44.540
It's been there all along, they just didn't implement the new, more restrictive Section

09:44.540 --> 09:45.540
5 rules.

09:45.540 --> 09:49.080
And those rules are still gone, even though people have stopped paying attention.

09:49.080 --> 09:55.140
Meaning, no, you're not going to get charged $2,500 for misinformation, where misinformation

09:55.140 --> 09:57.820
is defined by PayPal at their sole discretion.

09:57.820 --> 10:00.320
The question remains though, why is all of this happening?

10:00.320 --> 10:03.520
What the hell has changed since the Elon Musk days of PayPal?

10:03.520 --> 10:07.340
The current CEO of PayPal, Dan Shulman, gave an interview with the Wall Street Journal

10:07.340 --> 10:11.240
in 2019, talking about why some people get banned and others don't.

10:11.240 --> 10:15.280
He cited Charlottesville as a defining moment for him, where he knew that PayPal had to

10:15.280 --> 10:16.280
change.

10:16.280 --> 10:20.560
He said, the line between free speech and hate isn't taught in college, and it's

10:20.560 --> 10:24.760
not defined in the law, and he believes that businesses need to be a force for good in

10:24.760 --> 10:26.320
the values they believe in.

10:26.320 --> 10:31.520
As for what values are the most core to PayPal, Shulman said diversity and inclusion, of course,

10:31.520 --> 10:36.000
and that he chose to make a visible stand and cancel expansion plans in North Carolina

10:36.000 --> 10:41.040
after that state passed a bill making it mandatory for people to use the bathroom of their biological

10:41.040 --> 10:42.040
sex.

10:42.040 --> 10:45.920
He also made it clear that the Southern Poverty Law Center helps inform PayPal's decisions

10:45.920 --> 10:51.000
on these matters, and in 2021, further partnered with the Anti-Defamation League to help identify

10:51.000 --> 10:53.760
extremist content flowing through PayPal.

10:53.760 --> 10:58.320
It seems to be the attitude of Dan Shulman specifically that's driving a lot of this

10:58.320 --> 10:59.320
stuff.

10:59.320 --> 11:03.160
When PayPal split off from eBay and became its own company in 2015, Shulman was brought

11:03.160 --> 11:04.400
on to take the reins.

11:04.400 --> 11:09.480
PayPal's initial goal was to facilitate easy payments online in the face of a then-new

11:09.480 --> 11:10.480
internet marketplace.

11:10.480 --> 11:11.480
That's it.

11:11.480 --> 11:16.760
But Shulman, after taking power, said publicly, that ship has sailed, that era of PayPal is

11:16.760 --> 11:17.760
over.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.960
I think stepping into the role when I did was certainly a historic moment for PayPal.

11:20.960 --> 11:24.260
I thought when we became an independent company, it would give us a chance to reimagine the

11:24.260 --> 11:25.640
company moving forward.

11:25.640 --> 11:29.340
The new mission of PayPal became democratizing access to money.

11:29.340 --> 11:33.040
On the face of it, that just sounds like more people having access to online finance.

11:33.040 --> 11:38.080
But the word democratizing is used specifically here, to appeal to a majority rule.

11:38.080 --> 11:42.120
A fully democratized money system means that other people get to vote on how you spend

11:42.120 --> 11:45.120
your money, because a democratized system is not a private one.

11:45.120 --> 11:49.900
Shulman refers to all of this as financial inclusion, a topic I went over extensively

11:49.900 --> 11:52.480
in my video a few years back on MasterCard.

11:52.820 --> 11:54.800
It's all about getting more people into the system.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.360
And fair enough, because that added accessibility is pretty good.

11:57.360 --> 12:01.660
But the trade-off is that unlike with cash, your money is now controlled by the service

12:01.660 --> 12:06.440
that you're using, and PayPal isn't shy about wielding that power in a partisan way.

12:06.440 --> 12:10.480
Like I said before, PayPal is a private entity, and Shulman is a private individual.

12:10.480 --> 12:14.520
They have the right to be partisan leftoids and partner with partisan leftoid activist

12:14.520 --> 12:15.840
groups if they want.

12:15.840 --> 12:20.720
But because PayPal holds an effective monopoly right now, there is a very strong moral argument

12:20.720 --> 12:25.600
that either PayPal needs to be made to serve everyone equally regardless of political slant,

12:25.600 --> 12:29.720
accepting of course for money that's actually directly being used to fund violent action,

12:29.720 --> 12:33.840
and then let the political chips fall where they may, or there needs to be an actual market

12:33.840 --> 12:35.320
competitor to PayPal.

12:35.320 --> 12:40.500
And considering how, back when Sargon was banned from Patreon and moved over to Subscribestar,

12:40.500 --> 12:45.160
everyone pulled out a Subscribestar in response including PayPal, they clearly have no intention

12:45.160 --> 12:47.800
of letting an actual competitor organically grow.

12:47.800 --> 12:52.060
This is one of those times where government regulation of PayPal is required to maintain

12:52.060 --> 12:56.400
a level playing field, because PayPal seems to be too partisan right now to serve people

12:56.400 --> 12:57.800
equally of its own volition.
