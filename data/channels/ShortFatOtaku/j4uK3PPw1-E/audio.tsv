0	9180	Hello everyone, welcome to Tech Talk Tuesday. This is going to be a bit of a different episode
9180	12600	because I might have to cut it short, randomly out of nowhere. Naomi's currently getting
12600	17000	all four of her wisdom teeth out, all at once. She's going to be doing pretty bad when she
17000	21440	gets back, so I'm squeezing this in while she's at the dentist. I'll be taking off as
21440	25800	soon as she's done, so my time is actually very limited today. And for, let's say, the
25800	29800	fifty of you who actually watch my gaming streams, this does mean she's not going to
29800	34240	be around for at least a week. She can only eat liquid foods for like four days, and she
34240	37760	can't really have anything crunchy for another few weeks after that. And also she's going
37760	42440	to be on painkillers and lying around for what the dentist estimates to be maybe a week,
42440	46440	maybe a little bit less. So, no Naomi for a while, and I'm squeezing in this Tech Talk
46440	50400	Tuesday in the spare half an hour or so I have before going to pick her up. So let's
50400	51400	get right to it.
51400	56040	Can you be racist to white people? No. Why not? Educate yourself on racism. You cannot
56040	60640	be racist to white people. Educate yourself. But how? Why? If you look it up, you'll understand.
60640	68000	That's racist. That is racist, you fuck. This person is racist. Yes, because who was enslaved?
68000	73160	White people were enslaved too, by the Ottomans. Have you ever thought like maybe racism. Like
73160	78120	a bunch of Muslim empires enslave white people. Doing that so we fight amongst each other.
78840	83160	I'm being for real. I don't believe in it. Why can't we all just be friends? Why not?
83160	89560	Wow. Wow. That bitch is actually a racist. Listen, I don't buy the intersectional definition
89560	93680	of racism where you can't be racist against white people because white people spent some
93680	98600	time as the world hegemon. That's bullshit. Every group has been an oppressor. Every group
98600	102320	has been oppressed. And this person is just a fucking racist. And she gets away with it
102320	103920	because she's a brown racist.
103920	116880	This is a dead club. No, you can't approach the girl. Not allowed. No flirting allowed.
116880	126040	Here, I'll take you to safety from that sexual contact. There's a concept I have to cover. Maybe
126040	131960	I'll do it in like a main video called safe horny, where the idea is that this sort of normal sexual
131960	135680	interaction between, you know, a decent looking guy, a decent looking girl talking to each other
135680	140840	in a social situation. That's exploitative and terrible. And there's actually a safe horny way
140840	145360	that progressives like because you can tell when that when that ham planet came in and was like,
145360	148880	Nope, you can't talk to her. You know, she thought she was saving that girl from them.
148880	152920	Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is okay to be white.
152920	157720	Another race one. No, that's not it. That's not okay. Why not? It's terrible to be white.
157720	167360	What the fuck? What the fuck? What does she racist? Why is it not okay to be white?
167360	174520	What built civilization?
174520	178640	Too much good or too much bad?
178640	189000	Jesus Christ, these people are just racist. They're just anti white racist. That's it.
189000	194120	Imagine saying being black is bottom of the barrel. You'd be fucking crucified for that.
194120	201260	These people are disgusting. Oh, no, this is from fat pause a queer. I'm I can't wait for the cancer.
201260	210340	The guy at the window called me ma'am or madam like five times a girl. It's not a girl. Yeah,
210340	216780	like, thanks, ma'am. Jesus. At the very end of the interaction. He said have a blessed day.
216780	224180	I get misgendered all the time. What it is what it is. I don't want to explain your you're a woman
224180	229940	though. This is different. This felt very there's nothing masculine about you ladies cranky because
230940	235140	who did you mean with the hero comics? I'm on Andrew Tate like who Donald Trump maybe like who's
235140	239820	who's going to jail here lady, but no man, there's some like expert level delusion when it comes to
239820	244060	people like this. You know, if you see somebody who who passes or puts in a lot of effort to
244060	247540	looking like the other gender, you know, fair enough. It's probably reasonable to be miffed
247540	252700	that someone was impolite enough to misgender you, you know, calling Blair white a he doesn't make any
252700	257060	sense. That seems kind of rude. But this person all you've got is a shaved head lady nothing
257060	259900	masking about you. You're still a woman. You still look like when you still sound like one.
259900	265460	That's it. The reason that you're doing this trans non binary whatever crap is that you're 45. You
265460	269660	have nothing else going on in your life and you're sad and lonely. So you take it out by going on to
269660	275260	tick tock and shitting on the zoomer fast food restaurant worker that called you ma'am when you
275260	289860	are in fact a ma'am. Oh, baby, you're screaming. Jesus Christ, guys. I don't got to imagine I'm
289860	309780	hearing it right now. The feelings fucking mutual. Is this how you contribute to politics? You just
309780	324540	shriek. This person's fucking brain damaged. anarchists not even once. Oh my god. It's just it's
324540	331500	just impotent rage is just screaming because you don't get what you want all the time. And that's
331500	335900	what politics is sometimes you don't get what you want. Sometimes you must compromise. Welcome to the
335900	341660	real fucking world. What is it with leftoids and just shrieking irrationally? I mean, we've seen it
341660	345700	we've seen it now for what five years at least. There's always videos of and it's usually like
345700	350620	some chick comes out and just screams that doesn't have a point. She doesn't say anything. She just
350620	357220	reads at the camera. Why is it to show that you're just a fucking child friendly reminder that there
357220	362620	are no minimum requirements that you need to meet to feel like your gender. If you feel like a girl,
362700	367980	you're a girl. No, I have to wear makeup, or dresses or shave or pass at all. Yes, you do.
367980	372500	What matters most is how you feel. Go get it girly. No, dude, that's not true. Which is why
372500	376380	by the way, you're not a girl. You're a femme boy and a choker and you're even a femme boy.
376380	380500	You're not even feminine enough for that. The pushback against this is that gender is not
380500	385340	only how you feel, but it's how you're perceived. That's the point of it. It's a handshake. It's a
385340	392100	social signifier. Part of being masculine or feminine is looking and acting masculine
392100	396340	or feminine. This is why the feminists of yesteryear said that gender is a performance
396340	400460	because it partially is a performance. But these people doing the whole self ID thing have taken
400460	404140	the performance aspect out of it, but it doesn't function without that. The cold hard truth is if
404140	410340	you're male and you want to be seen as a woman by other people, that is something that is beyond
410340	415340	simply your identity. That is also how you present yourself to those other people,
415340	421500	which requires effort on your part. So yes, you have to pass. The reason that most normies find
421500	427860	this trans stuff intolerable while at the same time being completely respectful of those trans
427860	432780	people who integrate into society and live relatively normal lives is because those people,
432780	437860	the trans activists call them derisively trans assimilationists, they don't want to revolt
437900	442740	against society. They don't want to destroy the gender binary or any of this nonsense. They want
442740	447260	to be left alone to take their titty skittles and have whatever romantic relationships that they
447260	452460	want. They tend not to care about trans women in sports or what letter is beside their sex on their
452460	457900	birth certificate. They just want to be left alone. And that's reasonable. This self ID nonsense is
458020	481220	not reasonable. DNA bone structure chromosomes make you a woman. That's a white supremacist
481220	488060	talking point. What is science white supremacy? Things like bone structure is what white
488060	496820	supremacists do to separate themselves from black people. I'm pretty sure that white people can
496820	501860	separate themselves from black people and vice versa, just based on skin color. It's not hard,
501860	507020	but more importantly, I think this person's never spoken to like an Aboriginal activist before,
507260	511980	because her logic is going to be something like, we're all the same. There are races don't exist.
511980	516100	There are no races. There's no biological differences. Everyone's just one race. The
516100	519860	human race. Okay. Understood. Got it. Right. Okay. If you talk to like an Aboriginal racial
519860	525580	activist, they'll say the wildest shit, dude. They will say that like their race evolved in
525580	530720	North America and like a different location from like a different, like, like strand of biology
530720	534620	than any other race. And that they don't come out of Africa. Like everyone else does. They're like,
534620	540180	man, people are just fucking weird about race and all sides. Just like, just who cares? The
540180	544900	answer to this is who gives a shit. And no talking about the biological differences between men and
544900	550700	women is not white supremacist. Do you like, you have to have lost your fucking brain lady
550700	556180	to think this. That's what they've done. Separate themselves from black people. Like historically,
556180	562140	that's what they've done. White supremacists have said that white people and black people have DNA.
562180	566300	We're different species. We have different bones. We have different muscles. We're not different
566300	573060	species, but there are obviously genetic differences between the races. I don't listen
573060	577300	fellows. If your girl's white and she gives birth to a black baby, don't worry about it. Cause
577300	582300	according to this Hannah chick races don't exist. And now you're doing the same thing with trans
582300	586420	women. Like that's, that's heartbreaking, especially because that same rhetoric will be used
586420	591420	against you in the future. When a scientific truth does not jive with your retarded politics,
591580	598220	it is not the truth that should bend. It is you and your terrible ideas. We can accept that there
598220	603100	are biological differences between different types of people and not use that to put forward
603100	608780	some sort of supremacy narrative or some kind of like segregation, just as we are different.
608780	614340	Therefore we should oppress each other is stupid. We are not different in any way is also stupid.
614340	619500	So this right here is the pedo flag. The top two stripes are blue to represent attraction to young
619500	624420	boys. The mat flag guys represent attraction to young girls. The inner yellow stripes are
624420	629060	to represent childhood and general attraction to minors, regardless of their gender. My name is
629060	634380	Miranda. I use she, her pronouns and I'm a licensed professional counselor and sex therapist in Erie,
634380	643620	Pennsylvania. And today I want to talk about minor attracted persons because they are probably the
643620	651500	most vilified population of folks in our culture. The new woke frontier guys. Without actually
651500	655860	knowing much about them. And those are fucking music in the background though, Jesus, or an
655860	660940	already marginalized population. You may have noticed that I'm using the term minor attracted
660940	667220	person. Marginalizing them is good. Okay. Instead of the more commonly used term, not everything
667220	673500	should be normalized because the term pedophile has moved from being a diagnostic label to being
673540	679700	a judgmental, hurtful insult that we hurl at people in order to harm them or slander them.
679700	685100	Good. They should be judged. I also prefer person first language that recognizes that any label we
685100	690140	might apply to a person is only part of who they are and doesn't represent everything that they
690140	697060	are. We are all... You think this lady has a child skeletons in her closet? And this includes folks
697300	703660	who are attracted to minors. Now, listen, I know that there are tons of gay or trans people out
703660	709100	there who don't like this shit, but this is the next frontier of their activism. When you say the
709100	715020	slogan, love is love. There's no reason that can't be applied to all sorts of weird degenerate shit.
715020	720060	A video doing a deep dive into the whole trans groomer narrative is something that's on the
720060	723740	list. I know I said I was going to get out the trucker video in June, but maybe I'll just preempt
723740	728340	it to July and do this video in June instead. I don't know. I have to think about it. Oh,
728340	732540	it's time to go. Naomi's surgery is done, so I got to get out of here. Wish her well, guys. I
732540	736940	will see you next time. Oh, this also means that I won't be streaming tonight. Dave might stream
736940	740500	without me, but I'll be taking care of her. I'll see you next time, guys. I love you.
