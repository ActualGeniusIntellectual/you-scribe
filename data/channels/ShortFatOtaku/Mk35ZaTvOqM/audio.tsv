0	4740	Check this out. I'm on the the Dumping with Scrump podcast playlist. We've got
4740	10360	the interviewing Sofia Narwhits video right here on Slovenian politics. Okay, the
10360	14920	Skywalker saga is a failure. WHO lied. People died. There's a deleted video.
14920	20600	What's the deleted video, guys? I'll click on this. Oh, a copyright claim. It's
20600	26360	a copyright claim by Muso TNT Limited. Well, it's not actually by Muso TNT
26360	31400	Limited. It's by Sony. The missing Dumping with Scrump is the one on The
31400	36760	Last of Us 2. You know, the one that was comedically titled Let's Play Joel in One
36760	42240	Pro Golf. As you can see, it's still up on my Bitchute. Link in the description to
42240	46280	the Bitchute channel where you can watch this video if you want. I don't know if
46280	50440	I'll upload it on the the SFO backups channel because the copyright appeal is
50440	55240	still going through. We all know at this point that Sony has been basically
55280	60040	trying to scrub the entire internet of criticism of The Last of Us 2 simply
60040	64200	because the game seems to be an absolute shit show. So, link in the description. You
64200	67520	want to watch this podcast here does head over to my Bitchute channel and
67520	70480	while you're over there you might as well subscribe to me there too because I
70480	74240	put all my videos out over there at least most of my videos anyway I try the
74240	78240	the Bitchute like auto connector doesn't seem to work very well for my channel
78240	81120	videos don't go up in a timely manner and I'm not quite sure what to do about
81320	85960	it but who knows in any case the podcast is up over on Bitchute Sony's been
85960	90080	abusing the DMCA regarding my channel as they have been regarding so many other
90080	94080	youtubers and they can suck my dick
