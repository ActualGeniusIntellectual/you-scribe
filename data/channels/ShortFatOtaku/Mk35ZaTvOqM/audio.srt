Check this out. I'm on the the Dumping with Scrump podcast playlist. We've got

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:10,360
the interviewing Sofia Narwhits video right here on Slovenian politics. Okay, the

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,920
Skywalker saga is a failure. WHO lied. People died. There's a deleted video.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,600
What's the deleted video, guys? I'll click on this. Oh, a copyright claim. It's

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,360
a copyright claim by Muso TNT Limited. Well, it's not actually by Muso TNT

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,400
Limited. It's by Sony. The missing Dumping with Scrump is the one on The

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,760
Last of Us 2. You know, the one that was comedically titled Let's Play Joel in One

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,240
Pro Golf. As you can see, it's still up on my Bitchute. Link in the description to

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,280
the Bitchute channel where you can watch this video if you want. I don't know if

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,440
I'll upload it on the the SFO backups channel because the copyright appeal is

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,240
still going through. We all know at this point that Sony has been basically

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,040
trying to scrub the entire internet of criticism of The Last of Us 2 simply

13
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,200
because the game seems to be an absolute shit show. So, link in the description. You

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,520
want to watch this podcast here does head over to my Bitchute channel and

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,480
while you're over there you might as well subscribe to me there too because I

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,240
put all my videos out over there at least most of my videos anyway I try the

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,240
the Bitchute like auto connector doesn't seem to work very well for my channel

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,120
videos don't go up in a timely manner and I'm not quite sure what to do about

19
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,960
it but who knows in any case the podcast is up over on Bitchute Sony's been

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,080
abusing the DMCA regarding my channel as they have been regarding so many other

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,080
youtubers and they can suck my dick
