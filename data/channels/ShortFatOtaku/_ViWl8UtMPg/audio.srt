1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,820
In 2020, one component of Biden's presidential platform was student loan forgiveness. He

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,580
said in April of that year,

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,580
I'm announcing my intention to fight for two new policies. The first is lowering the

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,580
Medicare eligibility age to 60, and the second is forgiving student debt for low-income and

5
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,940
middle-class people who have attended public colleges and universities. More specifically,

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:31,360
I propose to forgive all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,560
public colleges and universities for debt holders earning up to $125,000 a year, with

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,680
appropriate phase-outs to avoid a cliff. The federal government would pay the monthly payment

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,480
in lieu of the borrower until the forgivable portion of the loan was paid off. This was

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,080
an extremely popular position among America's left-leaning voting population. Even though

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,560
the 2020 election seems to be more about people disliking Trump than liking Biden, you could

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,400
make the argument that in so much as people liked Biden, they liked him for student loan

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,280
forgiveness. However, it still wouldn't come for another two years and change. Nancy Pelosi,

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,040
Speaker of the House, famously said in 2021 that the president didn't have the power to

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,140
forgive student debt. And during this period, a lot of progressives on Twitter were screaming

16
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,120
bloody murder that Biden wasn't fulfilling any of his promises. In fact, in a few places,

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,880
like expanding the IRS or finishing the border wall, Biden was doing exactly what Democrats

18
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,880
said Trump would do. 2021 really was the year of memes about Biden's broken promises.

19
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,600
But I can't show you any of those tweets anymore because I got banned off Twitter again.

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,520
Oops. It's really hard to do a blanket search for stuff when you're not logged into a functioning

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,480
account. That's okay, though. I trust that you've seen the Prague screeching about how

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,400
Biden's reneged in his promises. Well, screech no longer. Biden announced last week that

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,720
student loan relief was coming. And it's basically the same program he outlined back in April

24
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,760
of 2020. Borrowers who hold loans to the Department of Education and make less than

25
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,680
$125,000 a year are eligible for up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness if they received

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,600
Pell Grants, which are given to students from low and middle income families. Individuals

27
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,920
who make less than $125,000 a year but did not receive Pell Grants are eligible for $10,000

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,460
in loan forgiveness. Something not being talked about is, as a part of this program, the official

29
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:14,000
end of the COVID student loan freeze was also announced, December 31, 2022. After that,

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,120
loan payments start coming due again.

31
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,640
This info comes from the Politico article, How Biden Finally Got to Yes on Canceling

32
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,740
Student Debt, and it reconfirms something that anybody intelligent should understand,

33
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,240
but also that activists refuse to accept, that the government is a slow-moving bureaucracy.

34
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,560
The president cannot simply will things into existence with the powers of the office. Trump

35
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,380
learned that the hard way during his own tenure, and seems to be relearning it again with the

36
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,720
whole I said it's declassified, so it is, procedure be damned debacle. Presidents have

37
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,080
agendas they want to pursue, but they also have to figure out if they're going to break

38
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,360
something by just haphazardly tugging on the levers of power. Populists don't want to hear

39
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,460
that. They don't care about the stability of institutions, they only care about achieving

40
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,100
their desired end result. That's why whenever an institution delivers a result they don't

41
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,240
like, whether it's Trump losing an election, or Roe v. Wade being overturned, it can't

42
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,780
be that they fairly lost the game, it's that the game must be rigged and needs to be changed

43
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,480
so that they never lose again. The Politico article points out that throughout 2021, back

44
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,080
when Nancy Pelosi was saying the president couldn't forgive student debt, that's

45
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,720
actually what Biden's team thought at the time. White House attorneys were exploring

46
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,600
legal avenues to actually get it done, and back then it seemed like it would be illegal

47
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,720
for him to do. But by January 2022, they came back with a different verdict. It was in fact

48
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,200
legally possible for President Biden to do so, and it's at this point that the Biden

49
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,180
administration began to negotiate with other factions within the government to determine

50
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,320
the appropriate amount of relief. Of course, conservatives online have fired back by pointing

51
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,160
out exactly what kind of education that progs generally get, dissecting Taylor Swift lyrics,

52
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,820
anti-capitalist feminist witchcraft, white supremacy culture workbooks, identifying literally

53
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,840
anything good as toxic whiteness, degrees in feminist dance therapy while an old meme

54
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,820
still checks out. The stereotype of the broke barista who is failing to pay off a useless

55
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,920
degree has at least some basis in reality. We could spend a whole video making fun of

56
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,040
the wacky shit coming out of academia right now. In fact, maybe I'll do that another

57
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,040
time. The point I'm making is, though, when conservatives ask, this is what you want

58
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,040
tax dollars to go towards forgiving, that seems to be a reasonable criticism. These

59
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,760
aren't engineering students with a run of bad luck and would otherwise be indispensable

60
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,860
to American civilization. These are people who went to school for a degree that didn't

61
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,740
increase the value of their labor, and now that they've gone from valueless to valueless

62
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,440
and in debt, they're feeling the pinch. Is that their fault? Well, kinda. They were

63
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,140
18. They did choose to go to school and they're ultimately responsible for their lives. But

64
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,500
unless you're a millennial, you don't know what it was like in the 2000s. The pressure

65
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,480
for everybody to go to a degree mill, even if it meant going into debt, was extreme.

66
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,260
We were all told that getting a degree meant a good job and that a student loan was worth

67
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,180
it. If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't have wasted my time, personally. And I didn't

68
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,060
even have a loan to pay off. For me, it was a combination of help from my parents, working

69
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,700
through school, and grants due to my high marks. So when somebody like Lauren Boebert

70
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:18,020
comes out and says shit like this, there's at least a hint of truth to it. However, I

71
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,180
will say, lesbian dance theory might actually be profitable nowadays, in the age of Tik

72
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,140
Tok dances. Of course, the prongs would rather call her homophobic for the joke than address

73
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,580
the actual issue. Is it good to forgive this debt? It's hard to miss the fact that the

74
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:36,380
same people who object to student loan forgiveness are those who took advantage of PPP loan forgiveness.

75
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,620
The PPP is the Paycheck Protection Program, a loan that businesses could take out to keep

76
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,620
their workforce employed during the pandemic. Rather than lay off workers, businesses could

77
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,740
keep them on, pay them with PPP money, and then pay it back after the pandemic's over.

78
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,520
These loans were also forgiven, and leftoids are noticing the hypocrisy of many rightoids

79
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,620
who oppose student loan forgiveness while at the same time accepting PPP loan forgiveness.

80
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,340
There is a little bit of difference, though. While students were pressured into going into

81
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,220
school like I said, they could still say no in the end. But businesses were forced to

82
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,580
close under threat of government action during the lockdowns. There was no choice to say

83
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,360
no. Even if both groups might have a stick up their ass about their own superiority,

84
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,400
these aren't exactly comparable situations. Lots of people are also saying that they object

85
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,280
to student loan forgiveness because, well, they paid off their loans, so everyone else

86
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,400
should have to as well. One person even confronted Elizabeth Warren with this very point back

87
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:50,960
on the campaign trail when this was all just theoretical.

88
00:06:50,960 --> 00:07:04,280
Yeah, in case you didn't see it through the crowd, she laughed at him and ended the conversation.

89
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,360
But it's a legitimate question. Why should people have their loans forgiven when others

90
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,640
paid them off? And doesn't that mean that the more responsible people who ended up paying

91
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,420
also end up paying for other people's loans through their own taxes? Leftoids like to

92
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,880
make fun of this question by comparing student loans to cancer. And that might get a chuckle

93
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,600
out of me, but I also know that this doesn't actually answer the question because cancer

94
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,200
isn't student loans, believe it or not. Let's try to actually answer the question posed

95
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,120
to Elizabeth Warren in this clip.

96
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,480
In order to do so, we're going to have to dig into MMT a bit. That's modern monetary

97
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,320
theory. I've spoken to both Econoboi and Friended about it before. I know MMT triggers

98
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,360
the fuck out of my audience whenever I bring it up, so I gotta give you guys the trigger

99
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,240
warning. What I'm about to say is descriptive only, not prescriptive. I'm not talking about

100
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,780
what I want to be, I'm talking about what is. So please remember that before you fly

101
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,820
off the handle in the comment section, okay?

102
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:54,000
When the value of a dollar is not pegged to the value of some physical object. When one

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,540
dollar doesn't represent some amount of gold, for example, and is instead printed by the

104
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,940
government, that is fiat currency. In a fiat system, the government has a unique place

105
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,320
in the market. It doesn't necessarily need to keep a balanced budget, like a household

106
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,200
or a business might. For private actors, they have income and expenses. Money goes in, money

107
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,860
goes out. In the past, when we still used gold and silver coins, the government would

108
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,900
operate in the same way. Money in, money out. The king's coffers would literally be a treasury

109
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,940
of gold that could be spent on projects. But in a fiat system, the government doesn't

110
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,060
play the game, the government is the referee of the game. In my video on Bidenflation,

111
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,420
I described how in a fiat system, the total amount of money is pegged to the total amount

112
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,060
of production of the nation that prints it. And how if you just print more money, each

113
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,860
individual dollar is now worth less because the total pool of production hasn't actually

114
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,160
changed. However, I also described that if you print money in such a way that it stimulates

115
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,020
more production, the example I used in the video is giving a small businessman a grant

116
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,280
to build a new productive business. Because both the money supply and the production supply

117
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,820
go up, inflation doesn't happen. Therefore, printing money willy-nilly like in Sri Lanka

118
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,800
or in Venezuela can destroy an economy. But printing money doesn't have to do that if

119
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,240
you do it in a reserved, means-tested way. That is how the government is the referee

120
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,820
of the game, not a player of it like you or I. The government has the power to determine

121
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,580
how much production each dollar is worth. It can print money to make dollars worth less

122
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,240
production, but it can also destroy money to make dollars worth more production. One

123
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,580
of the reasons that both counterfeiting money and destroying money is a crime is because

124
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,540
regulation of the total supply of dollars is something that government wants a monopoly

125
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,940
over. When a private actor goes bankrupt, they've got no more money. They're out

126
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,500
of resources. And unless given outside help, the institution collapses. But governments

127
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,660
can literally just print money if they run out. Yes, that will inflate the dollar. And

128
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,340
that sucks for everyone else because they'll lose some purchasing power. But before, the

129
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,480
government had zero purchasing power, and now it has some purchasing power through the

130
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,160
action of printing money. It's for this reason that conservatives like to point out

131
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,180
that printing money is a wealth transfer from the people to the government because the people

132
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,700
lose purchasing power and the government gains it. This is true, but it's a bit simplistic.

133
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,420
There's more to it than that. Let's say you decide to go down to the tax office in

134
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,880
person and pay your taxes in physical money. After handing your cash over to the government

135
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,880
employee, they might as well take it out back and burn it because it doesn't matter anymore.

136
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,480
It's not like the government is going to use those specific physical dollars to buy

137
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,980
anything. In a fiat system, the government's role is to keep score of the money supply.

138
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,560
When the government gives people money, they increase the money supply in the market. When

139
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,900
the government taxes money back from the people, they decrease the money supply. As the referee

140
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,780
of the game, the government isn't too concerned with balancing their own budget, leading to

141
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:31,260
this famous gaffe. To the person who is about to grab their car keys and go to the ATM and

142
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:37,780
take out $3,000, you say what? You don't need to. Your ATM is safe. Your banks are safe.

143
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,740
There's enough cash in the financial system and there is an infinite amount of cash at

144
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,980
the Federal Reserve. We will do whatever we need to do to make sure that there's enough

145
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,540
cash in the banking system. It's more accurate to say that the government doesn't need to

146
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,340
secure an income source to balance its expenditures. It can borrow against the future by printing

147
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,180
money, but that's a powerful tool that can utterly destroy an economy if it's used irresponsibly.

148
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,840
In this way, taxation actually doesn't serve to fund the government. Taxation serves to

149
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,180
remove money from the economy, lowering the money supply, thereby offsetting the effects

150
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,900
of inflation that comes with printing money to fund the government. This is why Elizabeth

151
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,180
Warren laughed at that guy and why other leftoids are laughing at rightoids right now. They're

152
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,580
technically correct in that taxes don't actually fund the government, and a rightoid who screams

153
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:24,180
stop spending my tax dollars just sounds like a dumb hick. But a lot of them disengage their

154
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,420
brain at that point of the conversation because they believe they can print that shit indefinitely

155
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,300
and that's just not the case. If you want your economy to survive, printing money and

156
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,000
taxation are two knobs that have to be turned in tandem and kept in balance. That's what

157
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,560
the leftoids don't understand. Like I said before, if the government has no purchasing

158
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,620
power left, all it has to do is print money and give it to itself. The resulting inflation

159
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,800
transfers purchasing power from the people to the government, and in order to balance

160
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,300
the resulting inflation, the government can raise taxes on people to lower the money supply

161
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,940
again. But that's not exactly what's happening with student loan forgiveness. It's the universities

162
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,260
that hold the debt. If you go to a university and get a student loan, it's ultimately that

163
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,180
university that has owed money. Let's say you take out a private loan to pay for your degree

164
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,860
from a bank. The bank might pay the university what they're owed, but now the bank is owed money

165
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,020
instead. None of the players involved here are the referee. They're all going to want to see

166
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,340
that debt paid off directly. Now let's say you vanish off the face of the earth. Now there's no

167
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,220
way for anyone to get their money back. The university and the bank are going to look at

168
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,620
each other and be like, well, I'm owed something here. The university is not going to want to give

169
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,300
the cash back and the bank's going to want it back. At that point, it's just a game of who is

170
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,900
left holding the bag. But if it's a government student loan, that's a whole different story.

171
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,940
When you get a student loan from the government, the government essentially prints money and pays

172
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,020
the university with it. This causes some inflation, but the government is hoping that your increased

173
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,740
productive capacity later in life as a result of that education will offset the inflation. If you

174
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,980
can't pay off the debt, the university is in no danger of being hung out to dry because they're

175
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,780
not dealing with another player, they're dealing with the referee. And when the government says,

176
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,900
hey, you've got to pay back those student loans, what's actually happening there is the money you

177
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,260
pay the government disappears from the economy, lowering the money supply, which helps to counter

178
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,540
the inflation caused by your loan in the first place. However, if government student loans are

179
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,620
forgiven, that's more money in the hands of people who took the loans. Great, the left says,

180
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,820
but that's also more money that can be spent on other things instead. Great, the left says again,

181
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,380
but if it's being spent on other things, that's more money in the economy and less money being

182
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:20,260
removed from it to counter inflation. And that's not so great. We already know that inflation is a

183
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,660
method by which purchasing power is siphoned around the economy. So when the government is

184
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,940
no longer shrinking the money supply due to student loan forgiveness, who is gaining and

185
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,260
who is losing purchasing power? Well, the people who are gaining purchasing power are the people

186
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,300
with the loans. That's why they can spend that money and other stuff instead of paying the

187
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,340
government. The people who lose it seem to be people who save liquid money for a rainy day

188
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,820
rather than holding assets. In other words, if your wealth is physical dollars or a number in

189
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,380
a bank account and not stocks or property or something like that, you're the one that is

190
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,700
losing purchasing power when the government forgive student loans. For rich people, they

191
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,940
don't care because that number is already astronomically high. What does it matter to

192
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,260
them if food costs a little bit more? But for poor people who have only a few hundred in their

193
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,940
account and they got to make it stretch for a month, seeing food prices go up is devastating.

194
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,860
They're the ones who lose purchasing power and the people who had their student loans forgiven

195
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,940
get more. While the joke of useless degrees persists for a reason, compared to a high school

196
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,780
dropout, on average, completing high school increases yearly earnings by 25%, attending

197
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:21,060
college increases it by a further 11%, completing college increases that by a further 9%, completing

198
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:26,500
university bachelors increases that by a further 40%, a master's adds another 20%, a doctorate adds

199
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:33,180
25%. In total, your average doctorate earns 218% more than your average high school dropout per

200
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:38,500
year with a 1.1% unemployment rate compared to the high school dropouts 5.4%. In other words,

201
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,860
the people who stand to benefit from Biden's student loan relief are middle-class educated

202
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,140
white-collar workers and the purchasing power that they siphoned to themselves with this program is

203
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:52,060
going to disproportionately affect lower-class uneducated blue-collar workers. This is a wealth

204
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,460
transfer to the middle class and while some of that wealth is coming from the rich, enough of

205
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,380
it is coming from the poor to seriously hurt them. Like look at this person complaining about student

206
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,940
loan interest and how out-of-touch conservatives are when they tell them to just stop buying

207
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,220
Starbucks once a week. Fair enough, you won't actually save very much from not buying Starbucks,

208
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:12,380
but you're also a medical doctor. You're gonna be in the top 1% of society's earners over the

209
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,480
course of your lifetime and here you are whining that you need the feds to forgive your student

210
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,440
loans, a program which will be paid for by the labor of people who will make a whole lot less

211
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,480
than you. This is insanity. Add to that the fact that these people don't seem to know how to hold

212
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,240
on to their money. How the fuck are you earning $250,000 a year and still living paycheck to

213
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,040
paycheck? This is half of all Millennials. What the fuck are you guys buying? Cocaine? I never

214
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,040
thought I'd say this, but this unironically seems like entitled Millennials wanting to get their

215
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,320
way because society and the system are to blame for the collapsed ruin that is their life and it's

216
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,360
the people who are just keeping on working and getting by that are paying for it. So when that

217
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,120
working-class dude was yelling at Elizabeth Warren he's not wrong exactly. It's not that person A

218
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,320
didn't get a break and person B did and they're jealous. It's that person B's break is ultimately

219
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,960
going to be funded by person A. Not directly, not with physical tax dollars, but through the

220
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,760
inflation that will siphon purchasing power from person A's paltry savings into the government and

221
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,700
then the government will use that purchasing power to benefit person B. When you look at it like that

222
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:15,500
Lauren Boebert's earlier comments don't sound so crazy after all. She's too dumb to understand why

223
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,820
she's correct I think, but she's still correct. The problem with Biden's student loan forgiveness

224
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,980
isn't that people got useless degrees and they're crying about needing a bailout even if that might

225
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,900
be kind of true. It's not that people are jealous that they didn't get relief and now somebody else

226
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,940
did and that doesn't seem fair even if that's kind of true too. I don't really care about that stuff.

227
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,380
The real problem with it is that we're already in a time when inflation is running wild and we need

228
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:41,340
to be taking steps to solve the problem, not exacerbate it. Student loan forgiveness, at least

229
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:46,060
right now, exacerbates the inflation problem in a way that disproportionately helps middle class

230
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:51,260
educated progressives at the expense of our most vulnerable population, the very same working class

231
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,020
that progressives claim to support.
