0	10820	In 2020, one component of Biden's presidential platform was student loan forgiveness. He
10820	12580	said in April of that year,
12580	16580	I'm announcing my intention to fight for two new policies. The first is lowering the
16580	21580	Medicare eligibility age to 60, and the second is forgiving student debt for low-income and
21580	25940	middle-class people who have attended public colleges and universities. More specifically,
25940	31360	I propose to forgive all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year
31360	36560	public colleges and universities for debt holders earning up to $125,000 a year, with
36560	40680	appropriate phase-outs to avoid a cliff. The federal government would pay the monthly payment
40680	44480	in lieu of the borrower until the forgivable portion of the loan was paid off. This was
44480	48080	an extremely popular position among America's left-leaning voting population. Even though
48080	52560	the 2020 election seems to be more about people disliking Trump than liking Biden, you could
52560	56400	make the argument that in so much as people liked Biden, they liked him for student loan
56400	61280	forgiveness. However, it still wouldn't come for another two years and change. Nancy Pelosi,
61280	65040	Speaker of the House, famously said in 2021 that the president didn't have the power to
65040	69140	forgive student debt. And during this period, a lot of progressives on Twitter were screaming
69140	74120	bloody murder that Biden wasn't fulfilling any of his promises. In fact, in a few places,
74120	78880	like expanding the IRS or finishing the border wall, Biden was doing exactly what Democrats
78880	83880	said Trump would do. 2021 really was the year of memes about Biden's broken promises.
83880	87600	But I can't show you any of those tweets anymore because I got banned off Twitter again.
87600	91520	Oops. It's really hard to do a blanket search for stuff when you're not logged into a functioning
91520	95480	account. That's okay, though. I trust that you've seen the Prague screeching about how
95480	100400	Biden's reneged in his promises. Well, screech no longer. Biden announced last week that
100400	104720	student loan relief was coming. And it's basically the same program he outlined back in April
104720	108760	of 2020. Borrowers who hold loans to the Department of Education and make less than
108760	114680	$125,000 a year are eligible for up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness if they received
114680	118600	Pell Grants, which are given to students from low and middle income families. Individuals
118600	123920	who make less than $125,000 a year but did not receive Pell Grants are eligible for $10,000
123920	128460	in loan forgiveness. Something not being talked about is, as a part of this program, the official
128460	134000	end of the COVID student loan freeze was also announced, December 31, 2022. After that,
134000	136120	loan payments start coming due again.
136120	140640	This info comes from the Politico article, How Biden Finally Got to Yes on Canceling
140640	144740	Student Debt, and it reconfirms something that anybody intelligent should understand,
144740	149240	but also that activists refuse to accept, that the government is a slow-moving bureaucracy.
149240	153560	The president cannot simply will things into existence with the powers of the office. Trump
153560	157380	learned that the hard way during his own tenure, and seems to be relearning it again with the
157380	161720	whole I said it's declassified, so it is, procedure be damned debacle. Presidents have
161720	165080	agendas they want to pursue, but they also have to figure out if they're going to break
165080	169360	something by just haphazardly tugging on the levers of power. Populists don't want to hear
169360	172460	that. They don't care about the stability of institutions, they only care about achieving
172460	176100	their desired end result. That's why whenever an institution delivers a result they don't
176100	180240	like, whether it's Trump losing an election, or Roe v. Wade being overturned, it can't
180240	184780	be that they fairly lost the game, it's that the game must be rigged and needs to be changed
184780	189480	so that they never lose again. The Politico article points out that throughout 2021, back
189480	193080	when Nancy Pelosi was saying the president couldn't forgive student debt, that's
193080	196720	actually what Biden's team thought at the time. White House attorneys were exploring
196720	200600	legal avenues to actually get it done, and back then it seemed like it would be illegal
200600	205720	for him to do. But by January 2022, they came back with a different verdict. It was in fact
205720	209200	legally possible for President Biden to do so, and it's at this point that the Biden
209200	212180	administration began to negotiate with other factions within the government to determine
212180	216320	the appropriate amount of relief. Of course, conservatives online have fired back by pointing
216320	221160	out exactly what kind of education that progs generally get, dissecting Taylor Swift lyrics,
221160	225820	anti-capitalist feminist witchcraft, white supremacy culture workbooks, identifying literally
225820	230840	anything good as toxic whiteness, degrees in feminist dance therapy while an old meme
230840	234820	still checks out. The stereotype of the broke barista who is failing to pay off a useless
234820	238920	degree has at least some basis in reality. We could spend a whole video making fun of
238920	243040	the wacky shit coming out of academia right now. In fact, maybe I'll do that another
243040	247040	time. The point I'm making is, though, when conservatives ask, this is what you want
247040	251040	tax dollars to go towards forgiving, that seems to be a reasonable criticism. These
251040	254760	aren't engineering students with a run of bad luck and would otherwise be indispensable
254760	258860	to American civilization. These are people who went to school for a degree that didn't
258860	262740	increase the value of their labor, and now that they've gone from valueless to valueless
262740	267440	and in debt, they're feeling the pinch. Is that their fault? Well, kinda. They were
267440	271140	18. They did choose to go to school and they're ultimately responsible for their lives. But
271140	274500	unless you're a millennial, you don't know what it was like in the 2000s. The pressure
274500	278480	for everybody to go to a degree mill, even if it meant going into debt, was extreme.
278480	282260	We were all told that getting a degree meant a good job and that a student loan was worth
282260	286180	it. If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't have wasted my time, personally. And I didn't
286180	290060	even have a loan to pay off. For me, it was a combination of help from my parents, working
290060	294700	through school, and grants due to my high marks. So when somebody like Lauren Boebert
294700	318020	comes out and says shit like this, there's at least a hint of truth to it. However, I
318020	322180	will say, lesbian dance theory might actually be profitable nowadays, in the age of Tik
322180	326140	Tok dances. Of course, the prongs would rather call her homophobic for the joke than address
326140	330580	the actual issue. Is it good to forgive this debt? It's hard to miss the fact that the
330580	336380	same people who object to student loan forgiveness are those who took advantage of PPP loan forgiveness.
336380	340620	The PPP is the Paycheck Protection Program, a loan that businesses could take out to keep
340620	344620	their workforce employed during the pandemic. Rather than lay off workers, businesses could
344620	348740	keep them on, pay them with PPP money, and then pay it back after the pandemic's over.
348740	352520	These loans were also forgiven, and leftoids are noticing the hypocrisy of many rightoids
352520	357620	who oppose student loan forgiveness while at the same time accepting PPP loan forgiveness.
357620	361340	There is a little bit of difference, though. While students were pressured into going into
361340	365220	school like I said, they could still say no in the end. But businesses were forced to
365220	369580	close under threat of government action during the lockdowns. There was no choice to say
369580	373360	no. Even if both groups might have a stick up their ass about their own superiority,
373360	377400	these aren't exactly comparable situations. Lots of people are also saying that they object
377400	381280	to student loan forgiveness because, well, they paid off their loans, so everyone else
381280	385400	should have to as well. One person even confronted Elizabeth Warren with this very point back
385400	410960	on the campaign trail when this was all just theoretical.
410960	424280	Yeah, in case you didn't see it through the crowd, she laughed at him and ended the conversation.
424280	428360	But it's a legitimate question. Why should people have their loans forgiven when others
428360	432640	paid them off? And doesn't that mean that the more responsible people who ended up paying
432640	436420	also end up paying for other people's loans through their own taxes? Leftoids like to
436420	439880	make fun of this question by comparing student loans to cancer. And that might get a chuckle
439880	443600	out of me, but I also know that this doesn't actually answer the question because cancer
443600	448200	isn't student loans, believe it or not. Let's try to actually answer the question posed
448200	450120	to Elizabeth Warren in this clip.
450120	453480	In order to do so, we're going to have to dig into MMT a bit. That's modern monetary
453480	457320	theory. I've spoken to both Econoboi and Friended about it before. I know MMT triggers
457320	460360	the fuck out of my audience whenever I bring it up, so I gotta give you guys the trigger
460360	464240	warning. What I'm about to say is descriptive only, not prescriptive. I'm not talking about
464240	467780	what I want to be, I'm talking about what is. So please remember that before you fly
467780	469820	off the handle in the comment section, okay?
469820	474000	When the value of a dollar is not pegged to the value of some physical object. When one
474000	477540	dollar doesn't represent some amount of gold, for example, and is instead printed by the
477540	481940	government, that is fiat currency. In a fiat system, the government has a unique place
481940	485320	in the market. It doesn't necessarily need to keep a balanced budget, like a household
485320	489200	or a business might. For private actors, they have income and expenses. Money goes in, money
489200	492860	goes out. In the past, when we still used gold and silver coins, the government would
492860	496900	operate in the same way. Money in, money out. The king's coffers would literally be a treasury
496900	500940	of gold that could be spent on projects. But in a fiat system, the government doesn't
500940	505060	play the game, the government is the referee of the game. In my video on Bidenflation,
505060	509420	I described how in a fiat system, the total amount of money is pegged to the total amount
509420	513060	of production of the nation that prints it. And how if you just print more money, each
513060	517860	individual dollar is now worth less because the total pool of production hasn't actually
517860	521160	changed. However, I also described that if you print money in such a way that it stimulates
521160	525020	more production, the example I used in the video is giving a small businessman a grant
525020	529280	to build a new productive business. Because both the money supply and the production supply
529280	533820	go up, inflation doesn't happen. Therefore, printing money willy-nilly like in Sri Lanka
533820	537800	or in Venezuela can destroy an economy. But printing money doesn't have to do that if
537800	542240	you do it in a reserved, means-tested way. That is how the government is the referee
542240	545820	of the game, not a player of it like you or I. The government has the power to determine
545820	549580	how much production each dollar is worth. It can print money to make dollars worth less
549580	553240	production, but it can also destroy money to make dollars worth more production. One
553240	557580	of the reasons that both counterfeiting money and destroying money is a crime is because
557580	561540	regulation of the total supply of dollars is something that government wants a monopoly
561540	564940	over. When a private actor goes bankrupt, they've got no more money. They're out
564940	568500	of resources. And unless given outside help, the institution collapses. But governments
568500	572660	can literally just print money if they run out. Yes, that will inflate the dollar. And
572660	576340	that sucks for everyone else because they'll lose some purchasing power. But before, the
576340	580480	government had zero purchasing power, and now it has some purchasing power through the
580480	584160	action of printing money. It's for this reason that conservatives like to point out
584160	588180	that printing money is a wealth transfer from the people to the government because the people
588180	592700	lose purchasing power and the government gains it. This is true, but it's a bit simplistic.
592700	596420	There's more to it than that. Let's say you decide to go down to the tax office in
596420	600880	person and pay your taxes in physical money. After handing your cash over to the government
600880	604880	employee, they might as well take it out back and burn it because it doesn't matter anymore.
604880	608480	It's not like the government is going to use those specific physical dollars to buy
608480	612980	anything. In a fiat system, the government's role is to keep score of the money supply.
612980	616560	When the government gives people money, they increase the money supply in the market. When
616560	620900	the government taxes money back from the people, they decrease the money supply. As the referee
620900	624780	of the game, the government isn't too concerned with balancing their own budget, leading to
624780	631260	this famous gaffe. To the person who is about to grab their car keys and go to the ATM and
631260	637780	take out $3,000, you say what? You don't need to. Your ATM is safe. Your banks are safe.
637780	641740	There's enough cash in the financial system and there is an infinite amount of cash at
641740	644980	the Federal Reserve. We will do whatever we need to do to make sure that there's enough
644980	648540	cash in the banking system. It's more accurate to say that the government doesn't need to
648540	653340	secure an income source to balance its expenditures. It can borrow against the future by printing
653340	658180	money, but that's a powerful tool that can utterly destroy an economy if it's used irresponsibly.
658180	662840	In this way, taxation actually doesn't serve to fund the government. Taxation serves to
662840	667180	remove money from the economy, lowering the money supply, thereby offsetting the effects
667180	670900	of inflation that comes with printing money to fund the government. This is why Elizabeth
670900	675180	Warren laughed at that guy and why other leftoids are laughing at rightoids right now. They're
675180	679580	technically correct in that taxes don't actually fund the government, and a rightoid who screams
679580	684180	stop spending my tax dollars just sounds like a dumb hick. But a lot of them disengage their
684180	688420	brain at that point of the conversation because they believe they can print that shit indefinitely
688420	692300	and that's just not the case. If you want your economy to survive, printing money and
692300	697000	taxation are two knobs that have to be turned in tandem and kept in balance. That's what
697000	700560	the leftoids don't understand. Like I said before, if the government has no purchasing
700560	704620	power left, all it has to do is print money and give it to itself. The resulting inflation
704620	707800	transfers purchasing power from the people to the government, and in order to balance
707800	711300	the resulting inflation, the government can raise taxes on people to lower the money supply
711300	715940	again. But that's not exactly what's happening with student loan forgiveness. It's the universities
715940	720260	that hold the debt. If you go to a university and get a student loan, it's ultimately that
720260	724180	university that has owed money. Let's say you take out a private loan to pay for your degree
724180	727860	from a bank. The bank might pay the university what they're owed, but now the bank is owed money
727860	732020	instead. None of the players involved here are the referee. They're all going to want to see
732020	736340	that debt paid off directly. Now let's say you vanish off the face of the earth. Now there's no
736340	739220	way for anyone to get their money back. The university and the bank are going to look at
739220	742620	each other and be like, well, I'm owed something here. The university is not going to want to give
742620	746300	the cash back and the bank's going to want it back. At that point, it's just a game of who is
746300	749900	left holding the bag. But if it's a government student loan, that's a whole different story.
750100	753940	When you get a student loan from the government, the government essentially prints money and pays
753940	758020	the university with it. This causes some inflation, but the government is hoping that your increased
758020	762740	productive capacity later in life as a result of that education will offset the inflation. If you
762740	766980	can't pay off the debt, the university is in no danger of being hung out to dry because they're
766980	769780	not dealing with another player, they're dealing with the referee. And when the government says,
769780	773900	hey, you've got to pay back those student loans, what's actually happening there is the money you
773900	778260	pay the government disappears from the economy, lowering the money supply, which helps to counter
778260	782540	the inflation caused by your loan in the first place. However, if government student loans are
782540	786620	forgiven, that's more money in the hands of people who took the loans. Great, the left says,
786620	790820	but that's also more money that can be spent on other things instead. Great, the left says again,
790820	795380	but if it's being spent on other things, that's more money in the economy and less money being
795380	800260	removed from it to counter inflation. And that's not so great. We already know that inflation is a
800260	804660	method by which purchasing power is siphoned around the economy. So when the government is
804660	808940	no longer shrinking the money supply due to student loan forgiveness, who is gaining and
808940	813260	who is losing purchasing power? Well, the people who are gaining purchasing power are the people
813260	816300	with the loans. That's why they can spend that money and other stuff instead of paying the
816300	820340	government. The people who lose it seem to be people who save liquid money for a rainy day
820340	824820	rather than holding assets. In other words, if your wealth is physical dollars or a number in
824820	828380	a bank account and not stocks or property or something like that, you're the one that is
828380	831700	losing purchasing power when the government forgive student loans. For rich people, they
831700	834940	don't care because that number is already astronomically high. What does it matter to
834940	838260	them if food costs a little bit more? But for poor people who have only a few hundred in their
838260	841940	account and they got to make it stretch for a month, seeing food prices go up is devastating.
841940	845860	They're the ones who lose purchasing power and the people who had their student loans forgiven
845860	850940	get more. While the joke of useless degrees persists for a reason, compared to a high school
850940	855780	dropout, on average, completing high school increases yearly earnings by 25%, attending
855780	861060	college increases it by a further 11%, completing college increases that by a further 9%, completing
861060	866500	university bachelors increases that by a further 40%, a master's adds another 20%, a doctorate adds
866500	873180	25%. In total, your average doctorate earns 218% more than your average high school dropout per
873180	878500	year with a 1.1% unemployment rate compared to the high school dropouts 5.4%. In other words,
878500	882860	the people who stand to benefit from Biden's student loan relief are middle-class educated
882860	887140	white-collar workers and the purchasing power that they siphoned to themselves with this program is
887140	892060	going to disproportionately affect lower-class uneducated blue-collar workers. This is a wealth
892060	895460	transfer to the middle class and while some of that wealth is coming from the rich, enough of
895460	899380	it is coming from the poor to seriously hurt them. Like look at this person complaining about student
899380	902940	loan interest and how out-of-touch conservatives are when they tell them to just stop buying
902940	907220	Starbucks once a week. Fair enough, you won't actually save very much from not buying Starbucks,
907220	912380	but you're also a medical doctor. You're gonna be in the top 1% of society's earners over the
912380	916480	course of your lifetime and here you are whining that you need the feds to forgive your student
916480	920440	loans, a program which will be paid for by the labor of people who will make a whole lot less
920440	924480	than you. This is insanity. Add to that the fact that these people don't seem to know how to hold
924480	930240	on to their money. How the fuck are you earning $250,000 a year and still living paycheck to
930240	935040	paycheck? This is half of all Millennials. What the fuck are you guys buying? Cocaine? I never
935040	939040	thought I'd say this, but this unironically seems like entitled Millennials wanting to get their
939040	943320	way because society and the system are to blame for the collapsed ruin that is their life and it's
943360	947360	the people who are just keeping on working and getting by that are paying for it. So when that
947360	952120	working-class dude was yelling at Elizabeth Warren he's not wrong exactly. It's not that person A
952120	957320	didn't get a break and person B did and they're jealous. It's that person B's break is ultimately
957320	961960	going to be funded by person A. Not directly, not with physical tax dollars, but through the
961960	966760	inflation that will siphon purchasing power from person A's paltry savings into the government and
966760	970700	then the government will use that purchasing power to benefit person B. When you look at it like that
970700	975500	Lauren Boebert's earlier comments don't sound so crazy after all. She's too dumb to understand why
975500	979820	she's correct I think, but she's still correct. The problem with Biden's student loan forgiveness
979820	983980	isn't that people got useless degrees and they're crying about needing a bailout even if that might
983980	987900	be kind of true. It's not that people are jealous that they didn't get relief and now somebody else

1001340	1006060	right now, exacerbates the inflation problem in a way that disproportionately helps middle class
1006060	1011260	educated progressives at the expense of our most vulnerable population, the very same working class
1011260	1013020	that progressives claim to support.
