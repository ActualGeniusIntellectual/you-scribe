00:00.000 --> 00:10.820
In 2020, one component of Biden's presidential platform was student loan forgiveness. He

00:10.820 --> 00:12.580
said in April of that year,

00:12.580 --> 00:16.580
I'm announcing my intention to fight for two new policies. The first is lowering the

00:16.580 --> 00:21.580
Medicare eligibility age to 60, and the second is forgiving student debt for low-income and

00:21.580 --> 00:25.940
middle-class people who have attended public colleges and universities. More specifically,

00:25.940 --> 00:31.360
I propose to forgive all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year

00:31.360 --> 00:36.560
public colleges and universities for debt holders earning up to $125,000 a year, with

00:36.560 --> 00:40.680
appropriate phase-outs to avoid a cliff. The federal government would pay the monthly payment

00:40.680 --> 00:44.480
in lieu of the borrower until the forgivable portion of the loan was paid off. This was

00:44.480 --> 00:48.080
an extremely popular position among America's left-leaning voting population. Even though

00:48.080 --> 00:52.560
the 2020 election seems to be more about people disliking Trump than liking Biden, you could

00:52.560 --> 00:56.400
make the argument that in so much as people liked Biden, they liked him for student loan

00:56.400 --> 01:01.280
forgiveness. However, it still wouldn't come for another two years and change. Nancy Pelosi,

01:01.280 --> 01:05.040
Speaker of the House, famously said in 2021 that the president didn't have the power to

01:05.040 --> 01:09.140
forgive student debt. And during this period, a lot of progressives on Twitter were screaming

01:09.140 --> 01:14.120
bloody murder that Biden wasn't fulfilling any of his promises. In fact, in a few places,

01:14.120 --> 01:18.880
like expanding the IRS or finishing the border wall, Biden was doing exactly what Democrats

01:18.880 --> 01:23.880
said Trump would do. 2021 really was the year of memes about Biden's broken promises.

01:23.880 --> 01:27.600
But I can't show you any of those tweets anymore because I got banned off Twitter again.

01:27.600 --> 01:31.520
Oops. It's really hard to do a blanket search for stuff when you're not logged into a functioning

01:31.520 --> 01:35.480
account. That's okay, though. I trust that you've seen the Prague screeching about how

01:35.480 --> 01:40.400
Biden's reneged in his promises. Well, screech no longer. Biden announced last week that

01:40.400 --> 01:44.720
student loan relief was coming. And it's basically the same program he outlined back in April

01:44.720 --> 01:48.760
of 2020. Borrowers who hold loans to the Department of Education and make less than

01:48.760 --> 01:54.680
$125,000 a year are eligible for up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness if they received

01:54.680 --> 01:58.600
Pell Grants, which are given to students from low and middle income families. Individuals

01:58.600 --> 02:03.920
who make less than $125,000 a year but did not receive Pell Grants are eligible for $10,000

02:03.920 --> 02:08.460
in loan forgiveness. Something not being talked about is, as a part of this program, the official

02:08.460 --> 02:14.000
end of the COVID student loan freeze was also announced, December 31, 2022. After that,

02:14.000 --> 02:16.120
loan payments start coming due again.

02:16.120 --> 02:20.640
This info comes from the Politico article, How Biden Finally Got to Yes on Canceling

02:20.640 --> 02:24.740
Student Debt, and it reconfirms something that anybody intelligent should understand,

02:24.740 --> 02:29.240
but also that activists refuse to accept, that the government is a slow-moving bureaucracy.

02:29.240 --> 02:33.560
The president cannot simply will things into existence with the powers of the office. Trump

02:33.560 --> 02:37.380
learned that the hard way during his own tenure, and seems to be relearning it again with the

02:37.380 --> 02:41.720
whole I said it's declassified, so it is, procedure be damned debacle. Presidents have

02:41.720 --> 02:45.080
agendas they want to pursue, but they also have to figure out if they're going to break

02:45.080 --> 02:49.360
something by just haphazardly tugging on the levers of power. Populists don't want to hear

02:49.360 --> 02:52.460
that. They don't care about the stability of institutions, they only care about achieving

02:52.460 --> 02:56.100
their desired end result. That's why whenever an institution delivers a result they don't

02:56.100 --> 03:00.240
like, whether it's Trump losing an election, or Roe v. Wade being overturned, it can't

03:00.240 --> 03:04.780
be that they fairly lost the game, it's that the game must be rigged and needs to be changed

03:04.780 --> 03:09.480
so that they never lose again. The Politico article points out that throughout 2021, back

03:09.480 --> 03:13.080
when Nancy Pelosi was saying the president couldn't forgive student debt, that's

03:13.080 --> 03:16.720
actually what Biden's team thought at the time. White House attorneys were exploring

03:16.720 --> 03:20.600
legal avenues to actually get it done, and back then it seemed like it would be illegal

03:20.600 --> 03:25.720
for him to do. But by January 2022, they came back with a different verdict. It was in fact

03:25.720 --> 03:29.200
legally possible for President Biden to do so, and it's at this point that the Biden

03:29.200 --> 03:32.180
administration began to negotiate with other factions within the government to determine

03:32.180 --> 03:36.320
the appropriate amount of relief. Of course, conservatives online have fired back by pointing

03:36.320 --> 03:41.160
out exactly what kind of education that progs generally get, dissecting Taylor Swift lyrics,

03:41.160 --> 03:45.820
anti-capitalist feminist witchcraft, white supremacy culture workbooks, identifying literally

03:45.820 --> 03:50.840
anything good as toxic whiteness, degrees in feminist dance therapy while an old meme

03:50.840 --> 03:54.820
still checks out. The stereotype of the broke barista who is failing to pay off a useless

03:54.820 --> 03:58.920
degree has at least some basis in reality. We could spend a whole video making fun of

03:58.920 --> 04:03.040
the wacky shit coming out of academia right now. In fact, maybe I'll do that another

04:03.040 --> 04:07.040
time. The point I'm making is, though, when conservatives ask, this is what you want

04:07.040 --> 04:11.040
tax dollars to go towards forgiving, that seems to be a reasonable criticism. These

04:11.040 --> 04:14.760
aren't engineering students with a run of bad luck and would otherwise be indispensable

04:14.760 --> 04:18.860
to American civilization. These are people who went to school for a degree that didn't

04:18.860 --> 04:22.740
increase the value of their labor, and now that they've gone from valueless to valueless

04:22.740 --> 04:27.440
and in debt, they're feeling the pinch. Is that their fault? Well, kinda. They were

04:27.440 --> 04:31.140
18. They did choose to go to school and they're ultimately responsible for their lives. But

04:31.140 --> 04:34.500
unless you're a millennial, you don't know what it was like in the 2000s. The pressure

04:34.500 --> 04:38.480
for everybody to go to a degree mill, even if it meant going into debt, was extreme.

04:38.480 --> 04:42.260
We were all told that getting a degree meant a good job and that a student loan was worth

04:42.260 --> 04:46.180
it. If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't have wasted my time, personally. And I didn't

04:46.180 --> 04:50.060
even have a loan to pay off. For me, it was a combination of help from my parents, working

04:50.060 --> 04:54.700
through school, and grants due to my high marks. So when somebody like Lauren Boebert

04:54.700 --> 05:18.020
comes out and says shit like this, there's at least a hint of truth to it. However, I

05:18.020 --> 05:22.180
will say, lesbian dance theory might actually be profitable nowadays, in the age of Tik

05:22.180 --> 05:26.140
Tok dances. Of course, the prongs would rather call her homophobic for the joke than address

05:26.140 --> 05:30.580
the actual issue. Is it good to forgive this debt? It's hard to miss the fact that the

05:30.580 --> 05:36.380
same people who object to student loan forgiveness are those who took advantage of PPP loan forgiveness.

05:36.380 --> 05:40.620
The PPP is the Paycheck Protection Program, a loan that businesses could take out to keep

05:40.620 --> 05:44.620
their workforce employed during the pandemic. Rather than lay off workers, businesses could

05:44.620 --> 05:48.740
keep them on, pay them with PPP money, and then pay it back after the pandemic's over.

05:48.740 --> 05:52.520
These loans were also forgiven, and leftoids are noticing the hypocrisy of many rightoids

05:52.520 --> 05:57.620
who oppose student loan forgiveness while at the same time accepting PPP loan forgiveness.

05:57.620 --> 06:01.340
There is a little bit of difference, though. While students were pressured into going into

06:01.340 --> 06:05.220
school like I said, they could still say no in the end. But businesses were forced to

06:05.220 --> 06:09.580
close under threat of government action during the lockdowns. There was no choice to say

06:09.580 --> 06:13.360
no. Even if both groups might have a stick up their ass about their own superiority,

06:13.360 --> 06:17.400
these aren't exactly comparable situations. Lots of people are also saying that they object

06:17.400 --> 06:21.280
to student loan forgiveness because, well, they paid off their loans, so everyone else

06:21.280 --> 06:25.400
should have to as well. One person even confronted Elizabeth Warren with this very point back

06:25.400 --> 06:50.960
on the campaign trail when this was all just theoretical.

06:50.960 --> 07:04.280
Yeah, in case you didn't see it through the crowd, she laughed at him and ended the conversation.

07:04.280 --> 07:08.360
But it's a legitimate question. Why should people have their loans forgiven when others

07:08.360 --> 07:12.640
paid them off? And doesn't that mean that the more responsible people who ended up paying

07:12.640 --> 07:16.420
also end up paying for other people's loans through their own taxes? Leftoids like to

07:16.420 --> 07:19.880
make fun of this question by comparing student loans to cancer. And that might get a chuckle

07:19.880 --> 07:23.600
out of me, but I also know that this doesn't actually answer the question because cancer

07:23.600 --> 07:28.200
isn't student loans, believe it or not. Let's try to actually answer the question posed

07:28.200 --> 07:30.120
to Elizabeth Warren in this clip.

07:30.120 --> 07:33.480
In order to do so, we're going to have to dig into MMT a bit. That's modern monetary

07:33.480 --> 07:37.320
theory. I've spoken to both Econoboi and Friended about it before. I know MMT triggers

07:37.320 --> 07:40.360
the fuck out of my audience whenever I bring it up, so I gotta give you guys the trigger

07:40.360 --> 07:44.240
warning. What I'm about to say is descriptive only, not prescriptive. I'm not talking about

07:44.240 --> 07:47.780
what I want to be, I'm talking about what is. So please remember that before you fly

07:47.780 --> 07:49.820
off the handle in the comment section, okay?

07:49.820 --> 07:54.000
When the value of a dollar is not pegged to the value of some physical object. When one

07:54.000 --> 07:57.540
dollar doesn't represent some amount of gold, for example, and is instead printed by the

07:57.540 --> 08:01.940
government, that is fiat currency. In a fiat system, the government has a unique place

08:01.940 --> 08:05.320
in the market. It doesn't necessarily need to keep a balanced budget, like a household

08:05.320 --> 08:09.200
or a business might. For private actors, they have income and expenses. Money goes in, money

08:09.200 --> 08:12.860
goes out. In the past, when we still used gold and silver coins, the government would

08:12.860 --> 08:16.900
operate in the same way. Money in, money out. The king's coffers would literally be a treasury

08:16.900 --> 08:20.940
of gold that could be spent on projects. But in a fiat system, the government doesn't

08:20.940 --> 08:25.060
play the game, the government is the referee of the game. In my video on Bidenflation,

08:25.060 --> 08:29.420
I described how in a fiat system, the total amount of money is pegged to the total amount

08:29.420 --> 08:33.060
of production of the nation that prints it. And how if you just print more money, each

08:33.060 --> 08:37.860
individual dollar is now worth less because the total pool of production hasn't actually

08:37.860 --> 08:41.160
changed. However, I also described that if you print money in such a way that it stimulates

08:41.160 --> 08:45.020
more production, the example I used in the video is giving a small businessman a grant

08:45.020 --> 08:49.280
to build a new productive business. Because both the money supply and the production supply

08:49.280 --> 08:53.820
go up, inflation doesn't happen. Therefore, printing money willy-nilly like in Sri Lanka

08:53.820 --> 08:57.800
or in Venezuela can destroy an economy. But printing money doesn't have to do that if

08:57.800 --> 09:02.240
you do it in a reserved, means-tested way. That is how the government is the referee

09:02.240 --> 09:05.820
of the game, not a player of it like you or I. The government has the power to determine

09:05.820 --> 09:09.580
how much production each dollar is worth. It can print money to make dollars worth less

09:09.580 --> 09:13.240
production, but it can also destroy money to make dollars worth more production. One

09:13.240 --> 09:17.580
of the reasons that both counterfeiting money and destroying money is a crime is because

09:17.580 --> 09:21.540
regulation of the total supply of dollars is something that government wants a monopoly

09:21.540 --> 09:24.940
over. When a private actor goes bankrupt, they've got no more money. They're out

09:24.940 --> 09:28.500
of resources. And unless given outside help, the institution collapses. But governments

09:28.500 --> 09:32.660
can literally just print money if they run out. Yes, that will inflate the dollar. And

09:32.660 --> 09:36.340
that sucks for everyone else because they'll lose some purchasing power. But before, the

09:36.340 --> 09:40.480
government had zero purchasing power, and now it has some purchasing power through the

09:40.480 --> 09:44.160
action of printing money. It's for this reason that conservatives like to point out

09:44.160 --> 09:48.180
that printing money is a wealth transfer from the people to the government because the people

09:48.180 --> 09:52.700
lose purchasing power and the government gains it. This is true, but it's a bit simplistic.

09:52.700 --> 09:56.420
There's more to it than that. Let's say you decide to go down to the tax office in

09:56.420 --> 10:00.880
person and pay your taxes in physical money. After handing your cash over to the government

10:00.880 --> 10:04.880
employee, they might as well take it out back and burn it because it doesn't matter anymore.

10:04.880 --> 10:08.480
It's not like the government is going to use those specific physical dollars to buy

10:08.480 --> 10:12.980
anything. In a fiat system, the government's role is to keep score of the money supply.

10:12.980 --> 10:16.560
When the government gives people money, they increase the money supply in the market. When

10:16.560 --> 10:20.900
the government taxes money back from the people, they decrease the money supply. As the referee

10:20.900 --> 10:24.780
of the game, the government isn't too concerned with balancing their own budget, leading to

10:24.780 --> 10:31.260
this famous gaffe. To the person who is about to grab their car keys and go to the ATM and

10:31.260 --> 10:37.780
take out $3,000, you say what? You don't need to. Your ATM is safe. Your banks are safe.

10:37.780 --> 10:41.740
There's enough cash in the financial system and there is an infinite amount of cash at

10:41.740 --> 10:44.980
the Federal Reserve. We will do whatever we need to do to make sure that there's enough

10:44.980 --> 10:48.540
cash in the banking system. It's more accurate to say that the government doesn't need to

10:48.540 --> 10:53.340
secure an income source to balance its expenditures. It can borrow against the future by printing

10:53.340 --> 10:58.180
money, but that's a powerful tool that can utterly destroy an economy if it's used irresponsibly.

10:58.180 --> 11:02.840
In this way, taxation actually doesn't serve to fund the government. Taxation serves to

11:02.840 --> 11:07.180
remove money from the economy, lowering the money supply, thereby offsetting the effects

11:07.180 --> 11:10.900
of inflation that comes with printing money to fund the government. This is why Elizabeth

11:10.900 --> 11:15.180
Warren laughed at that guy and why other leftoids are laughing at rightoids right now. They're

11:15.180 --> 11:19.580
technically correct in that taxes don't actually fund the government, and a rightoid who screams

11:19.580 --> 11:24.180
stop spending my tax dollars just sounds like a dumb hick. But a lot of them disengage their

11:24.180 --> 11:28.420
brain at that point of the conversation because they believe they can print that shit indefinitely

11:28.420 --> 11:32.300
and that's just not the case. If you want your economy to survive, printing money and

11:32.300 --> 11:37.000
taxation are two knobs that have to be turned in tandem and kept in balance. That's what

11:37.000 --> 11:40.560
the leftoids don't understand. Like I said before, if the government has no purchasing

11:40.560 --> 11:44.620
power left, all it has to do is print money and give it to itself. The resulting inflation

11:44.620 --> 11:47.800
transfers purchasing power from the people to the government, and in order to balance

11:47.800 --> 11:51.300
the resulting inflation, the government can raise taxes on people to lower the money supply

11:51.300 --> 11:55.940
again. But that's not exactly what's happening with student loan forgiveness. It's the universities

11:55.940 --> 12:00.260
that hold the debt. If you go to a university and get a student loan, it's ultimately that

12:00.260 --> 12:04.180
university that has owed money. Let's say you take out a private loan to pay for your degree

12:04.180 --> 12:07.860
from a bank. The bank might pay the university what they're owed, but now the bank is owed money

12:07.860 --> 12:12.020
instead. None of the players involved here are the referee. They're all going to want to see

12:12.020 --> 12:16.340
that debt paid off directly. Now let's say you vanish off the face of the earth. Now there's no

12:16.340 --> 12:19.220
way for anyone to get their money back. The university and the bank are going to look at

12:19.220 --> 12:22.620
each other and be like, well, I'm owed something here. The university is not going to want to give

12:22.620 --> 12:26.300
the cash back and the bank's going to want it back. At that point, it's just a game of who is

12:26.300 --> 12:29.900
left holding the bag. But if it's a government student loan, that's a whole different story.

12:30.100 --> 12:33.940
When you get a student loan from the government, the government essentially prints money and pays

12:33.940 --> 12:38.020
the university with it. This causes some inflation, but the government is hoping that your increased

12:38.020 --> 12:42.740
productive capacity later in life as a result of that education will offset the inflation. If you

12:42.740 --> 12:46.980
can't pay off the debt, the university is in no danger of being hung out to dry because they're

12:46.980 --> 12:49.780
not dealing with another player, they're dealing with the referee. And when the government says,

12:49.780 --> 12:53.900
hey, you've got to pay back those student loans, what's actually happening there is the money you

12:53.900 --> 12:58.260
pay the government disappears from the economy, lowering the money supply, which helps to counter

12:58.260 --> 13:02.540
the inflation caused by your loan in the first place. However, if government student loans are

13:02.540 --> 13:06.620
forgiven, that's more money in the hands of people who took the loans. Great, the left says,

13:06.620 --> 13:10.820
but that's also more money that can be spent on other things instead. Great, the left says again,

13:10.820 --> 13:15.380
but if it's being spent on other things, that's more money in the economy and less money being

13:15.380 --> 13:20.260
removed from it to counter inflation. And that's not so great. We already know that inflation is a

13:20.260 --> 13:24.660
method by which purchasing power is siphoned around the economy. So when the government is

13:24.660 --> 13:28.940
no longer shrinking the money supply due to student loan forgiveness, who is gaining and

13:28.940 --> 13:33.260
who is losing purchasing power? Well, the people who are gaining purchasing power are the people

13:33.260 --> 13:36.300
with the loans. That's why they can spend that money and other stuff instead of paying the

13:36.300 --> 13:40.340
government. The people who lose it seem to be people who save liquid money for a rainy day

13:40.340 --> 13:44.820
rather than holding assets. In other words, if your wealth is physical dollars or a number in

13:44.820 --> 13:48.380
a bank account and not stocks or property or something like that, you're the one that is

13:48.380 --> 13:51.700
losing purchasing power when the government forgive student loans. For rich people, they

13:51.700 --> 13:54.940
don't care because that number is already astronomically high. What does it matter to

13:54.940 --> 13:58.260
them if food costs a little bit more? But for poor people who have only a few hundred in their

13:58.260 --> 14:01.940
account and they got to make it stretch for a month, seeing food prices go up is devastating.

14:01.940 --> 14:05.860
They're the ones who lose purchasing power and the people who had their student loans forgiven

14:05.860 --> 14:10.940
get more. While the joke of useless degrees persists for a reason, compared to a high school

14:10.940 --> 14:15.780
dropout, on average, completing high school increases yearly earnings by 25%, attending

14:15.780 --> 14:21.060
college increases it by a further 11%, completing college increases that by a further 9%, completing

14:21.060 --> 14:26.500
university bachelors increases that by a further 40%, a master's adds another 20%, a doctorate adds

14:26.500 --> 14:33.180
25%. In total, your average doctorate earns 218% more than your average high school dropout per

14:33.180 --> 14:38.500
year with a 1.1% unemployment rate compared to the high school dropouts 5.4%. In other words,

14:38.500 --> 14:42.860
the people who stand to benefit from Biden's student loan relief are middle-class educated

14:42.860 --> 14:47.140
white-collar workers and the purchasing power that they siphoned to themselves with this program is

14:47.140 --> 14:52.060
going to disproportionately affect lower-class uneducated blue-collar workers. This is a wealth

14:52.060 --> 14:55.460
transfer to the middle class and while some of that wealth is coming from the rich, enough of

14:55.460 --> 14:59.380
it is coming from the poor to seriously hurt them. Like look at this person complaining about student

14:59.380 --> 15:02.940
loan interest and how out-of-touch conservatives are when they tell them to just stop buying

15:02.940 --> 15:07.220
Starbucks once a week. Fair enough, you won't actually save very much from not buying Starbucks,

15:07.220 --> 15:12.380
but you're also a medical doctor. You're gonna be in the top 1% of society's earners over the

15:12.380 --> 15:16.480
course of your lifetime and here you are whining that you need the feds to forgive your student

15:16.480 --> 15:20.440
loans, a program which will be paid for by the labor of people who will make a whole lot less

15:20.440 --> 15:24.480
than you. This is insanity. Add to that the fact that these people don't seem to know how to hold

15:24.480 --> 15:30.240
on to their money. How the fuck are you earning $250,000 a year and still living paycheck to

15:30.240 --> 15:35.040
paycheck? This is half of all Millennials. What the fuck are you guys buying? Cocaine? I never

15:35.040 --> 15:39.040
thought I'd say this, but this unironically seems like entitled Millennials wanting to get their

15:39.040 --> 15:43.320
way because society and the system are to blame for the collapsed ruin that is their life and it's

15:43.360 --> 15:47.360
the people who are just keeping on working and getting by that are paying for it. So when that

15:47.360 --> 15:52.120
working-class dude was yelling at Elizabeth Warren he's not wrong exactly. It's not that person A

15:52.120 --> 15:57.320
didn't get a break and person B did and they're jealous. It's that person B's break is ultimately

15:57.320 --> 16:01.960
going to be funded by person A. Not directly, not with physical tax dollars, but through the

16:01.960 --> 16:06.760
inflation that will siphon purchasing power from person A's paltry savings into the government and

16:06.760 --> 16:10.700
then the government will use that purchasing power to benefit person B. When you look at it like that

16:10.700 --> 16:15.500
Lauren Boebert's earlier comments don't sound so crazy after all. She's too dumb to understand why

16:15.500 --> 16:19.820
she's correct I think, but she's still correct. The problem with Biden's student loan forgiveness

16:19.820 --> 16:23.980
isn't that people got useless degrees and they're crying about needing a bailout even if that might

16:23.980 --> 16:27.900
be kind of true. It's not that people are jealous that they didn't get relief and now somebody else

16:27.900 --> 16:31.940
did and that doesn't seem fair even if that's kind of true too. I don't really care about that stuff.

16:31.940 --> 16:36.380
The real problem with it is that we're already in a time when inflation is running wild and we need

16:36.380 --> 16:41.340
to be taking steps to solve the problem, not exacerbate it. Student loan forgiveness, at least

16:41.340 --> 16:46.060
right now, exacerbates the inflation problem in a way that disproportionately helps middle class

16:46.060 --> 16:51.260
educated progressives at the expense of our most vulnerable population, the very same working class

16:51.260 --> 16:53.020
that progressives claim to support.
