0	7000	We are not going to have a Supreme Court that will overturn Roe vs. Wade.
7000	11000	There will be no more Antonin Scalia's and Samuel Alito's added to this court.
11000	14000	We're not going to repeal health reform.
14000	19000	Nobody is going to kill Medicare and make old people in this generation or any other generation
19000	22000	fight it out on the open market to try to get themselves health insurance.
22000	24000	We are not going to do that.
24000	27000	We are not going to give a 20% tax cut to millionaires and billionaires
27000	32000	and expect programs like food stamps and kids health insurance to cover the cost of that tax cut.
32000	36000	We're not going to make you clear it with your boss if you want to get birth control
36000	38000	under the insurance plan that you're on.
38000	40000	We are not going to redefine rape.
40000	45000	We are not going to amend the United States Constitution to stop gay people from getting married.
45000	48000	We are not going to double Guantanamo.
48000	55000	We are not eliminating the Department of Energy or the Department of Education or housing at the federal level.
55000	59000	We are not going to spend $2 trillion on the military that the military does not want.
59000	65000	We are not scaling back on student loans because the country's new plan is that you should borrow money from your parents.
65000	67000	We are not vetoing the DREAM Act.
67000	69000	We are not self-deporting.
69000	71000	We are not letting Detroit go bankrupt.
71000	75000	We are not starting a trade war with China on Inauguration Day in January.
75000	81000	We are not going to have, as a president, a man who once led a mob of friends to run down a scared gay kid
81000	87000	to hold him down and forcibly cut his hair off with a pair of scissors while that kid cried and screamed for help.
87000	90000	And there was no apology, not ever.
90000	93000	We are not going to have a Secretary of State John Bolton.
93000	95000	We are not bringing Dick Cheney back.
95000	99000	We are not going to have a foreign policy shop stocked with architects of the Iraq War.
99000	101000	We are not going to do it.
101000	105000	We had the choice to do that if we wanted to do that as a country.
105000	109000	And we said no last night, loudly.
109000	115000	Now, to be fair, if you are a conservative or if you were rooting for the Republicans, a few things did go your way.
115000	119000	Republicans did not lose that Senate seat that they might have lost in Arizona.
119000	123000	John Kyle's old Senate seat goes to another Republican, to Jeff Flake.
123000	129000	Also, Republicans did not lose that other Senate seat they might have lost in Nevada, the old John Ensign seat that was given to Dean Heller.
129000	133000	It stays with him. It stays Republican, just barely.
133000	141000	And while President Obama carried 28 states last time, he carried 25 or 26 states this time, depending on how Florida goes.
141000	146000	So that means Republicans did lose everything else, but they got back Indiana and also North Carolina.
146000	149000	So it was not a totally hopeless night for Republicans.
149000	155000	Also, hey, remember the crazy Thaddeus McCotter seat in Michigan where Thaddeus McCotter screwed up
155000	161000	and the Republicans ended up having to run this reindeer herder Santa Claus impersonator guy for that seat?
161000	167000	A guy whose own brother says he's crazy and that he will end up in jail if the people of Michigan are crazy enough to elect him?
167000	173000	That guy won. Yeah, the shirtless reindeer guy won. So the Republicans have him.
173000	179000	Big picture in the House, thanks mostly to redistricting, the Republicans were not in danger of losing the House,
179000	186000	and they didn't lose it, even though the Republican majority appears to have shrunk there, and even though they did get the reindeer guy.
187000	194000	But in terms, honestly, of what went well for Republicans in this election, that was pretty much it. It is a short list.
194000	198000	You want to talk about what went well on the other side last night?
198000	205000	Here, I'm actually going to pause for a second to give you a chance to hit pause on your DVR in case you want to go make popcorn or something?
205000	209000	Maybe mix a drink? You are going to want to settle in for this, so get comfortable. Go ahead, I'll give you a second.
209000	217000	Okay, you back? Ready? Here we go.
217000	225000	So last night, the Democratic senator who was supposed to be the most endangered incumbent in the country not only won, she won by 16 points.
225000	232000	Republican Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts, who was so stuffed with hedge fund money that he burped credit default swaps.
232000	238000	Scott Brown lost by a lot to the nation's foremost authority on the economic rights of the middle class.
238000	249000	After marriage rights for same-sex couples were voted down in state after state after state for years, more than 30 times in a row, this year all changed in Maine.
249000	256000	They voted on marriage equality and they voted for it. In Maryland, they voted on marriage equality and they voted for it.
256000	262000	In Minnesota, they were asked to vote against marriage equality and Minnesota refused to ban it.
262000	273000	In Washington state, the vote is not called yet. They are still counting the vote and we will be watching it closely, but if you are on the pro-gay right side in Washington state, it should be noted that it is looking pretty good.
273000	280000	In Iowa, anti-gay activists were sure that they were going to turf out a judge for ruling in favor of marriage equality.
280000	287000	They had done it before to a bunch of other judges. They had been successful every time they had tried before, but not this one, not this time.
287000	294000	Judge Wiggins in Iowa keeps his seat. Nevada elects its first African-American congressman this year.
294000	302000	America gets our first openly gay United States senator. America gets our first ever Asian-American woman senator from Hawaii.
302000	310000	Her seat in the House, I should note, gets filled by this woman, a Democratic Iraq War veteran.
310000	317000	I'm going to tell you right now that her name is Tulsi Gabbard because she is on the fast track to being very famous someday. Tulsi Gabbard.
317000	323000	Speaking of Iraq War veterans, Tammy Duckworth, veteran helicopter pilot. She lost both of her legs in Iraq.
323000	330000	She is going to Congress and she is sending home the opponent who mocked her for her war record, Joe Walsh.
330000	336000	California relaxed its three-strikes-you're-out law and rejected a law to cripple the political power of unions.
336000	341000	Decriminalization of marijuana was approved in Washington and in Colorado.
341000	349000	The astonishing tide of dark money spent against Democratic senators Jon Tester in Montana and Sherrod Brown in Ohio turned out to be pointless.
349000	352000	Both those Democratic senators won. They held onto their seats.
352000	357000	Democrats won a Senate seat in North Dakota, of all places, a seat that nobody thought they could win.
357000	362000	All of these states that had this hugely aggressive total Republican takeover from the 2010 elections,
362000	366000	Ohio and Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Virginia and Florida,
366000	370000	all of those states that went so red in state government in these past couple of years
370000	376000	and that then had these big fights inside their states over how Republicans were governing there.
376000	381000	In Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and we will see about Florida,
381000	387000	last night not only did Republicans lose the presidential election in every single one of those states,
387000	391000	Republicans lost the Senate race in every single one of those states too.
391000	396000	Sherrod Brown, Tammy Baldwin, Debbie Stabenow, Bob Casey, Tim Kaine, Bill Nelson.
396000	403000	Depending on Florida, a Democratic sweep of the presidency and definitely a Democratic sweep of the Senate races.
403000	409000	In those states that the GOP was so excited to have supposedly turned red in a way that was going to stick.
409000	414000	Last night, Democratic women swept every major office in New Hampshire.
414000	419000	Last night, California Democrats won a Democratic supermajority in the State House and in the State Senate.
419000	425000	Not just majorities in California, but supermajorities wherein if the Republicans don't turn up,
425000	429000	any of them, any day at work, nothing will be different in California.
429000	432000	They're completely legislatively irrelevant.
432000	434000	Allen West lost his seat.
434000	438000	More women got elected to the U.S. Senate than at any time in U.S. history.
438000	445000	The Republican presidential nominee and vice presidential nominee both lost their home states.
445000	449000	Missouri and Montana and West Virginia chose Democratic governors.
449000	452000	West Virginia chose its first gay state legislator.
452000	454000	So did North Dakota.
454000	456000	West Virginia and North Dakota, yes, seriously.
456000	459000	Joe Lieberman's old seat went to a real Democrat in Connecticut.
459000	463000	The proportion of young people voting compared to 2008, it went up.
463000	466000	Same with African Americans, up from 2008.
466000	469000	Same with Latinos, up from 2008, not down, up.
469000	474000	If you are a liberal or if you were rooting for the Democrats, last night was a very, very, very big night.
474000	477000	And, oh, yeah, this happened.
477000	482000	President Barack Obama, yes, will go down in history as our nation's first African American president,
482000	489000	but he will also go down in history as the most successful Democratic presidential candidate since FDR.
489000	494000	President Bill Clinton got reelected, too, I know, but only Barack Obama got reelected
494000	499000	with not just big electoral college margins, but also with majority wins in the popular vote.
499000	501000	Twice.
502000	507000	The guy who predicted this outcome almost exactly is Nate Silver, of course,
507000	511000	who writes the political statistics blog FiveThirtyEight at the New York Times.
511000	515000	For accurately predicting, it appears, the exact outcome of the race,
515000	518000	and I mean down to every single state we'll see about Florida,
518000	524000	Nate was, of course, pilloried, pilloried on the right and by right-leaning Beltway media types,
524000	530000	including Politico.com, for having the audacity to print what his poll averages told him was about to happen.
531000	533000	But Nate was right. The polls were right.
533000	538000	Even without Florida being decided, we now know that President Obama won in pretty much exactly the way
538000	541000	the state-by-state polls said he was going to win.
541000	544000	He won with more than 300 electoral votes.
544000	550000	It was not magic, it was just math, math that was completely invisible to the political right.
551000	559000	I believe the minimum result will be 53-47 Romney, over 300 electoral votes,
559000	561000	and the Republicans will pick up the Senate.
561000	564000	I base that on just years and years of experience.
564000	569000	The wild card in what I've projected is I'm projecting Minnesota to go for Romney.
569000	573000	I think Ohioans vote with their wallets. That's why I think Romney's going to win on Tuesday.
573000	579000	Carl, I'm actually with you, except I think you're more optimistic. I got this, Romney, three points.
579000	584000	I think Ohio is going to be a squeaker, maybe an 80, 100, 110,000 vote margin,
584000	586000	but I think the Republicans are likely to take it.
586000	590000	Who's going to win this election? Charles Krauthammer, your best prediction.
591000	597000	Romney, very close, but he'll win the popular by I think about half a point,
597000	600000	electoral college probably, a very narrow margin.
600000	605000	It will be the biggest surprise in recent American political history.
605000	612000	It will rekindle a whole question as to why the media played this race as a nail-biter,
612000	615000	where in fact I think Romney's going to win by quite a bit.
615000	620000	I'm now predicting a 330 electoral vote landslide. Yes, that's right.
620000	622000	330 electoral votes.
622000	627000	Yes, that's right. No, that's not. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
627000	630000	But Republicans and conservatives plainly really believed this stuff.
630000	634000	I mean, they were talking each other into it a little bit, but it's not like they were faking it.
634000	637000	They were so, so, so, so, so, so sure they would win.
637000	642000	They were so sure that these polls must be wrong and that they must be right.
642000	647000	And when the real math of the real world came barreling out of the dark at them last night,
647000	650000	they hid from it. They could not believe it.
652000	658000	Fox News can now project that President Obama will win the crucial battleground state of Ohio.
658000	660000	That's the one we've all been waiting for.
660000	665000	And there's a question now about, you know, what does that mean, Pam?
665000	666000	I mean, does that mean?
666000	668000	That's the presidency.
668000	670000	Do you believe that Ohio has been settled?
670000	671000	No, I don't.
671000	677000	I got the director of the Ohio campaign for Romney on the other end of the line refreshing the page every few seconds.
677000	685000	I think this is premature. We've got to be careful about calling things when we have like 991 votes separating the two candidates and a quarter of the vote yet to count.
685000	690000	Well, folks, so maybe not so fast.
690000	692000	Here's what we're going to do.
692000	697000	Karl Rove said that we should figure out what the deal is with this decision desk.
697000	700000	The decision desk is in a different place.
700000	704000	Meghan, I will escort you down the steps here so you can go interview them.
704000	705000	All right.
705000	706000	Watch your step.
706000	710000	Thank you. Thank you. I don't want to fall in front of all these millions of people.
710000	714000	Meghan is going to go to the decision desk and interview them.
714000	717000	They're way down the hall.
717000	720000	So we'll do a little interrogation and see if they stand by their call.
720000	724000	This is the decision desk. Now we're in the heart of the decision desk room.
724000	729000	You tell me whether you stand by your call on Ohio given the doubts Karl Rove just raised.
729000	731000	We're actually quite comfortable with the call in Ohio.
731000	732000	What do you make of it, Chris?
732000	735000	There just aren't enough Republican votes left.
735000	736000	Percent certainty?
736000	738000	Ninety-nine point nine five percent.
738000	741000	OK. All right. Well, there you have it.
741000	746000	OK, Meghan, I've just called Karl back up from the and he's coming up here to the desk.
746000	750000	He's crunching numbers. He's writing furiously. He's pointing at Bill Hemmer.
750000	752000	A lot of things are going on right now.
752000	754000	All I'm saying is, is that, look, we've had it.
754000	758000	We've had one instance where something was prematurely called.
758000	764000	This seems to me to be a very early or very early call with the folks at Obama headquarters in Chicago.
764000	769000	They're not listening to Carl. They don't care about what Carl said.
769000	774000	Ohio really did go to President Obama last night, and he really did win.
774000	776000	And he really was born in Hawaii.
776000	780000	And he really is legitimately president of the United States again.
780000	784000	And the Bureau of Labor Statistics did not make up a fake unemployment rate last month.
784000	790000	And the Congressional Research Service really can find no evidence that cutting taxes on rich people grows the economy.
790000	793000	And the polls were not skewed to oversample Democrats.
793000	798000	And Nate Silver was not making up fake projections about the election to make conservatives feel bad.
798000	801000	Nate Silver was doing math.
801000	803000	And climate change is real.
803000	806000	And rape really does cause pregnancy sometimes.
806000	808000	And evolution is a thing.
808000	810000	And Benghazi was an attack on us.
810000	812000	It was not a scandal by us.
812000	814000	And nobody is taking away anyone's guns.
814000	816000	And taxes have not gone up.
816000	818000	And the deficit is dropping, actually.
818000	820000	And Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction.
820000	822000	And the moon landing was real.
822000	824000	And FEMA is not building concentration camps.
824000	828000	And U.N. election observers are not taking over Texas.
828000	836000	And moderate reforms of the regulations on the insurance industry and the financial services industry in this country are not the same thing as communism.
836000	841000	Listen, last night was a good night for liberals and for Democrats for very obvious reasons.
841000	844000	But it was also possibly a good night for this country as a whole.
844000	849000	Because in this country, we have a two-party system in government.
849000	856000	And the idea is supposed to be that the two sides both come up with ways to confront and fix the real problems facing our country.
856000	860000	They both propose possible solutions to our real problems.
860000	863000	And we debate between those possible solutions.
863000	866000	And by the process of debate, we pick the best idea.
866000	878000	That competition between good ideas from both sides about real problems in the real country should result in our country having better choices, better options than if only one side is really working on the hard stuff.
878000	891000	And if the Republican Party and the conservative movement and the conservative media is stuck in a vacuum-sealed door-locked spin cycle of telling each other what makes them feel good and denying the factual lived truth of the world,
891000	899000	then we are all deprived as a nation of the constructive debate between competing feasible ideas about real problems.
899000	903000	Last night, the Republicans got shellacked.
903000	906000	And they had no idea it was coming.
906000	915000	And we saw them in real time, in real humiliating time, not believe it even as it was happening to them.
916000	926000	And unless they are going to succeed, they are going to have to pop the factual bubble they have been so happy living inside if they do not want to get shellacked again.
926000	931000	And that will be a painful process for them, I'm sure, but it will be good for the whole country, left, right and center.
931000	934000	You guys, we're counting on you. Wake up.
934000	938000	There's real problems in the world. There are real knowable facts in the world.
938000	942000	Let's accept those and talk about how we might approach our problems differently.
942000	944000	Let's move on from there.
945000	954000	If the Republican Party and the conservative movement and conservative media are forced to do that by the humiliation they were dealt last night, we will all be better off as a nation.
954000	959000	And in that spirit, congratulations everybody.
959000	960000	Big night.
