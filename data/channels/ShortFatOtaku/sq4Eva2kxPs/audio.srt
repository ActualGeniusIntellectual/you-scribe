1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We are not going to have a Supreme Court that will overturn Roe vs. Wade.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There will be no more Antonin Scalia's and Samuel Alito's added to this court.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We're not going to repeal health reform.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Nobody is going to kill Medicare and make old people in this generation or any other generation

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
fight it out on the open market to try to get themselves health insurance.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We are not going to do that.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We are not going to give a 20% tax cut to millionaires and billionaires

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and expect programs like food stamps and kids health insurance to cover the cost of that tax cut.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We're not going to make you clear it with your boss if you want to get birth control

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
under the insurance plan that you're on.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We are not going to redefine rape.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We are not going to amend the United States Constitution to stop gay people from getting married.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are not going to double Guantanamo.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We are not eliminating the Department of Energy or the Department of Education or housing at the federal level.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We are not going to spend $2 trillion on the military that the military does not want.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We are not scaling back on student loans because the country's new plan is that you should borrow money from your parents.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We are not vetoing the DREAM Act.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We are not self-deporting.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We are not letting Detroit go bankrupt.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We are not starting a trade war with China on Inauguration Day in January.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We are not going to have, as a president, a man who once led a mob of friends to run down a scared gay kid

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
to hold him down and forcibly cut his hair off with a pair of scissors while that kid cried and screamed for help.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And there was no apology, not ever.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We are not going to have a Secretary of State John Bolton.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We are not bringing Dick Cheney back.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We are not going to have a foreign policy shop stocked with architects of the Iraq War.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We are not going to do it.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We had the choice to do that if we wanted to do that as a country.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And we said no last night, loudly.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Now, to be fair, if you are a conservative or if you were rooting for the Republicans, a few things did go your way.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Republicans did not lose that Senate seat that they might have lost in Arizona.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
John Kyle's old Senate seat goes to another Republican, to Jeff Flake.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Also, Republicans did not lose that other Senate seat they might have lost in Nevada, the old John Ensign seat that was given to Dean Heller.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It stays with him. It stays Republican, just barely.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And while President Obama carried 28 states last time, he carried 25 or 26 states this time, depending on how Florida goes.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So that means Republicans did lose everything else, but they got back Indiana and also North Carolina.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So it was not a totally hopeless night for Republicans.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Also, hey, remember the crazy Thaddeus McCotter seat in Michigan where Thaddeus McCotter screwed up

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and the Republicans ended up having to run this reindeer herder Santa Claus impersonator guy for that seat?

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
A guy whose own brother says he's crazy and that he will end up in jail if the people of Michigan are crazy enough to elect him?

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That guy won. Yeah, the shirtless reindeer guy won. So the Republicans have him.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Big picture in the House, thanks mostly to redistricting, the Republicans were not in danger of losing the House,

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and they didn't lose it, even though the Republican majority appears to have shrunk there, and even though they did get the reindeer guy.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But in terms, honestly, of what went well for Republicans in this election, that was pretty much it. It is a short list.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You want to talk about what went well on the other side last night?

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Here, I'm actually going to pause for a second to give you a chance to hit pause on your DVR in case you want to go make popcorn or something?

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Maybe mix a drink? You are going to want to settle in for this, so get comfortable. Go ahead, I'll give you a second.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay, you back? Ready? Here we go.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So last night, the Democratic senator who was supposed to be the most endangered incumbent in the country not only won, she won by 16 points.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Republican Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts, who was so stuffed with hedge fund money that he burped credit default swaps.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Scott Brown lost by a lot to the nation's foremost authority on the economic rights of the middle class.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:09,000
After marriage rights for same-sex couples were voted down in state after state after state for years, more than 30 times in a row, this year all changed in Maine.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
They voted on marriage equality and they voted for it. In Maryland, they voted on marriage equality and they voted for it.

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
In Minnesota, they were asked to vote against marriage equality and Minnesota refused to ban it.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:33,000
In Washington state, the vote is not called yet. They are still counting the vote and we will be watching it closely, but if you are on the pro-gay right side in Washington state, it should be noted that it is looking pretty good.

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
In Iowa, anti-gay activists were sure that they were going to turf out a judge for ruling in favor of marriage equality.

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
They had done it before to a bunch of other judges. They had been successful every time they had tried before, but not this one, not this time.

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Judge Wiggins in Iowa keeps his seat. Nevada elects its first African-American congressman this year.

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
America gets our first openly gay United States senator. America gets our first ever Asian-American woman senator from Hawaii.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Her seat in the House, I should note, gets filled by this woman, a Democratic Iraq War veteran.

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm going to tell you right now that her name is Tulsi Gabbard because she is on the fast track to being very famous someday. Tulsi Gabbard.

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Speaking of Iraq War veterans, Tammy Duckworth, veteran helicopter pilot. She lost both of her legs in Iraq.

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
She is going to Congress and she is sending home the opponent who mocked her for her war record, Joe Walsh.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
California relaxed its three-strikes-you're-out law and rejected a law to cripple the political power of unions.

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Decriminalization of marijuana was approved in Washington and in Colorado.

66
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The astonishing tide of dark money spent against Democratic senators Jon Tester in Montana and Sherrod Brown in Ohio turned out to be pointless.

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Both those Democratic senators won. They held onto their seats.

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Democrats won a Senate seat in North Dakota, of all places, a seat that nobody thought they could win.

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
All of these states that had this hugely aggressive total Republican takeover from the 2010 elections,

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Ohio and Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Virginia and Florida,

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
all of those states that went so red in state government in these past couple of years

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and that then had these big fights inside their states over how Republicans were governing there.

73
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
In Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and we will see about Florida,

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
last night not only did Republicans lose the presidential election in every single one of those states,

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Republicans lost the Senate race in every single one of those states too.

76
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Sherrod Brown, Tammy Baldwin, Debbie Stabenow, Bob Casey, Tim Kaine, Bill Nelson.

77
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Depending on Florida, a Democratic sweep of the presidency and definitely a Democratic sweep of the Senate races.

78
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
In those states that the GOP was so excited to have supposedly turned red in a way that was going to stick.

79
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Last night, Democratic women swept every major office in New Hampshire.

80
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Last night, California Democrats won a Democratic supermajority in the State House and in the State Senate.

81
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Not just majorities in California, but supermajorities wherein if the Republicans don't turn up,

82
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
any of them, any day at work, nothing will be different in California.

83
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
They're completely legislatively irrelevant.

84
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Allen West lost his seat.

85
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
More women got elected to the U.S. Senate than at any time in U.S. history.

86
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The Republican presidential nominee and vice presidential nominee both lost their home states.

87
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Missouri and Montana and West Virginia chose Democratic governors.

88
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
West Virginia chose its first gay state legislator.

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So did North Dakota.

90
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
West Virginia and North Dakota, yes, seriously.

91
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Joe Lieberman's old seat went to a real Democrat in Connecticut.

92
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The proportion of young people voting compared to 2008, it went up.

93
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Same with African Americans, up from 2008.

94
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Same with Latinos, up from 2008, not down, up.

95
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
If you are a liberal or if you were rooting for the Democrats, last night was a very, very, very big night.

96
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And, oh, yeah, this happened.

97
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
President Barack Obama, yes, will go down in history as our nation's first African American president,

98
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
but he will also go down in history as the most successful Democratic presidential candidate since FDR.

99
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
President Bill Clinton got reelected, too, I know, but only Barack Obama got reelected

100
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
with not just big electoral college margins, but also with majority wins in the popular vote.

101
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Twice.

102
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The guy who predicted this outcome almost exactly is Nate Silver, of course,

103
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
who writes the political statistics blog FiveThirtyEight at the New York Times.

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
For accurately predicting, it appears, the exact outcome of the race,

105
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and I mean down to every single state we'll see about Florida,

106
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Nate was, of course, pilloried, pilloried on the right and by right-leaning Beltway media types,

107
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
including Politico.com, for having the audacity to print what his poll averages told him was about to happen.

108
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But Nate was right. The polls were right.

109
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Even without Florida being decided, we now know that President Obama won in pretty much exactly the way

110
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
the state-by-state polls said he was going to win.

111
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He won with more than 300 electoral votes.

112
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It was not magic, it was just math, math that was completely invisible to the political right.

113
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I believe the minimum result will be 53-47 Romney, over 300 electoral votes,

114
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and the Republicans will pick up the Senate.

115
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I base that on just years and years of experience.

116
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The wild card in what I've projected is I'm projecting Minnesota to go for Romney.

117
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I think Ohioans vote with their wallets. That's why I think Romney's going to win on Tuesday.

118
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Carl, I'm actually with you, except I think you're more optimistic. I got this, Romney, three points.

119
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I think Ohio is going to be a squeaker, maybe an 80, 100, 110,000 vote margin,

120
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
but I think the Republicans are likely to take it.

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Who's going to win this election? Charles Krauthammer, your best prediction.

122
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Romney, very close, but he'll win the popular by I think about half a point,

123
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
electoral college probably, a very narrow margin.

124
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It will be the biggest surprise in recent American political history.

125
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It will rekindle a whole question as to why the media played this race as a nail-biter,

126
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
where in fact I think Romney's going to win by quite a bit.

127
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm now predicting a 330 electoral vote landslide. Yes, that's right.

128
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
330 electoral votes.

129
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yes, that's right. No, that's not. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

130
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But Republicans and conservatives plainly really believed this stuff.

131
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I mean, they were talking each other into it a little bit, but it's not like they were faking it.

132
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
They were so, so, so, so, so, so sure they would win.

133
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
They were so sure that these polls must be wrong and that they must be right.

134
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And when the real math of the real world came barreling out of the dark at them last night,

135
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
they hid from it. They could not believe it.

136
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Fox News can now project that President Obama will win the crucial battleground state of Ohio.

137
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That's the one we've all been waiting for.

138
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And there's a question now about, you know, what does that mean, Pam?

139
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I mean, does that mean?

140
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's the presidency.

141
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Do you believe that Ohio has been settled?

142
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
No, I don't.

143
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I got the director of the Ohio campaign for Romney on the other end of the line refreshing the page every few seconds.

144
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I think this is premature. We've got to be careful about calling things when we have like 991 votes separating the two candidates and a quarter of the vote yet to count.

145
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Well, folks, so maybe not so fast.

146
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Here's what we're going to do.

147
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Karl Rove said that we should figure out what the deal is with this decision desk.

148
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The decision desk is in a different place.

149
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Meghan, I will escort you down the steps here so you can go interview them.

150
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
All right.

151
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Watch your step.

152
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Thank you. Thank you. I don't want to fall in front of all these millions of people.

153
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Meghan is going to go to the decision desk and interview them.

154
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
They're way down the hall.

155
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So we'll do a little interrogation and see if they stand by their call.

156
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This is the decision desk. Now we're in the heart of the decision desk room.

157
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You tell me whether you stand by your call on Ohio given the doubts Karl Rove just raised.

158
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
We're actually quite comfortable with the call in Ohio.

159
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What do you make of it, Chris?

160
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
There just aren't enough Republican votes left.

161
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Percent certainty?

162
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Ninety-nine point nine five percent.

163
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
OK. All right. Well, there you have it.

164
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
OK, Meghan, I've just called Karl back up from the and he's coming up here to the desk.

165
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
He's crunching numbers. He's writing furiously. He's pointing at Bill Hemmer.

166
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
A lot of things are going on right now.

167
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
All I'm saying is, is that, look, we've had it.

168
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We've had one instance where something was prematurely called.

169
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
This seems to me to be a very early or very early call with the folks at Obama headquarters in Chicago.

170
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
They're not listening to Carl. They don't care about what Carl said.

171
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Ohio really did go to President Obama last night, and he really did win.

172
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And he really was born in Hawaii.

173
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And he really is legitimately president of the United States again.

174
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And the Bureau of Labor Statistics did not make up a fake unemployment rate last month.

175
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And the Congressional Research Service really can find no evidence that cutting taxes on rich people grows the economy.

176
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And the polls were not skewed to oversample Democrats.

177
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And Nate Silver was not making up fake projections about the election to make conservatives feel bad.

178
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Nate Silver was doing math.

179
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And climate change is real.

180
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And rape really does cause pregnancy sometimes.

181
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And evolution is a thing.

182
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And Benghazi was an attack on us.

183
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It was not a scandal by us.

184
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And nobody is taking away anyone's guns.

185
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And taxes have not gone up.

186
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And the deficit is dropping, actually.

187
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction.

188
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And the moon landing was real.

189
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And FEMA is not building concentration camps.

190
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And U.N. election observers are not taking over Texas.

191
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And moderate reforms of the regulations on the insurance industry and the financial services industry in this country are not the same thing as communism.

192
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Listen, last night was a good night for liberals and for Democrats for very obvious reasons.

193
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But it was also possibly a good night for this country as a whole.

194
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Because in this country, we have a two-party system in government.

195
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And the idea is supposed to be that the two sides both come up with ways to confront and fix the real problems facing our country.

196
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
They both propose possible solutions to our real problems.

197
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And we debate between those possible solutions.

198
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And by the process of debate, we pick the best idea.

199
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That competition between good ideas from both sides about real problems in the real country should result in our country having better choices, better options than if only one side is really working on the hard stuff.

200
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And if the Republican Party and the conservative movement and the conservative media is stuck in a vacuum-sealed door-locked spin cycle of telling each other what makes them feel good and denying the factual lived truth of the world,

201
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,000
then we are all deprived as a nation of the constructive debate between competing feasible ideas about real problems.

202
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Last night, the Republicans got shellacked.

203
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And they had no idea it was coming.

204
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And we saw them in real time, in real humiliating time, not believe it even as it was happening to them.

205
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And unless they are going to succeed, they are going to have to pop the factual bubble they have been so happy living inside if they do not want to get shellacked again.

206
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And that will be a painful process for them, I'm sure, but it will be good for the whole country, left, right and center.

207
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You guys, we're counting on you. Wake up.

208
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
There's real problems in the world. There are real knowable facts in the world.

209
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Let's accept those and talk about how we might approach our problems differently.

210
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Let's move on from there.

211
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:54,000
If the Republican Party and the conservative movement and conservative media are forced to do that by the humiliation they were dealt last night, we will all be better off as a nation.

212
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And in that spirit, congratulations everybody.

213
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Big night.
