0	2800	I first met Andy online.
2800	6040	Andy chooses not to identify as a specific gender,
6040	9400	so has asked to be referred to as they.
9400	12240	I went to see Andy the night before the sterilisation.
12240	13960	Ooh. Hello, kitty cat.
13960	15840	What's the cat's name? Peppy.
15840	17520	Peppy? Yeah.
17520	19600	Hello, Peppy.
19600	23400	Why are you doing this? What's motivated you?
23400	26880	I don't know. I just feel like I shouldn't be having children
26880	28520	and I don't want to, you know...
28520	30520	..mental health problems and things like that.
30520	32640	I just don't want to have to pass things on.
32640	35040	I don't know, I just... And obviously the work that I do,
35040	38120	I just don't want to accidentally fall pregnant.
38120	40080	That would be awful.
40080	42520	And what kind of work do you do?
42520	44160	I'm a sex worker.
44160	46640	So, yeah, there's more, I guess,
46640	48760	more risk of getting pregnant, in a way,
48760	50880	because I'm having a lot of sex.
50880	52880	Um...
52880	54920	Ooh. Is that my slippers?
54920	57720	Yeah, I did notice that. I do like them.
57960	60520	It's not My Little Pony, it's, um... It is.
60520	62080	Oh, it is My Little Pony!
62080	64720	Is that your dad? No, it's my uncle.
66400	68320	No, I never met my dad.
68320	69960	You never met him? No.
69960	72200	You've got, you know, My Pony. My Little Pony.
72200	74360	My Little Pony. You've got...
74360	76000	..Mr Squidgy, the hair in the middle.
76000	78840	I mean, you know, they're dolls and ponies.
78840	81560	It's something that children have.
81560	85960	And yet, tomorrow, you're getting permanently sterilised.
85960	90760	Yeah. I'm, like, a five-year-old child in an adult body.
90760	92880	Um, yeah, I don't know.
92880	95520	I guess, like, I had a really difficult childhood,
95520	99360	and for most of it, I wasn't able to be a child.
99360	100880	So I kind of, like, am, like,
100880	103840	reliving my childhood, but, like, as an adult.
105200	107280	Do you talk to your mum? No, no, no.
107280	109720	My mum disowned me.
109720	111640	So, no, I don't want to have a mother.
116960	120880	The New Zealand Shooters Manifesto was titled The Great Replacement,
120880	123200	a reference to the Great Replacement conspiracy theory
123200	125680	that the far-right has believed in for quite a while now.
125680	128000	The basic premise is that the unfettered immigration
128000	130520	of non-white people into white-majority countries,
130520	133200	alongside a socially engineered cultural shift
133200	135120	towards white people not wanting children,
135120	138800	will eventually lead to the replacement of the white populations with non-whites.
138800	140320	Or so the theory goes.
140320	142360	The theory itself is taking centre stage
142360	144200	due to the aforementioned shootings right now,
144800	148240	with the New York Times calling it a racist, sexist doctrine.
148240	150800	I don't see how it could be sexist, but racist?
150800	152240	I'd say that's probable.
152240	154600	However, I don't think anybody actually expects
154600	158960	a serious, unbiased analysis of the facts from the New York Times anymore.
158960	162280	To the left-leaning media and the SJWs on their staff,
162280	164160	The Great Replacement is racist,
164160	167080	because it's a rightist take on race relations.
167080	169520	The facts of the theory don't actually matter.
169520	172240	And unfortunately, the right is the only group at the moment
172240	174040	actually having the race discussion.
174040	176080	The left simply calls you a racist,
176080	179440	if you even entertain the idea of an open discussion on race.
179440	181400	And while that might have worked a decade ago,
181400	185280	everybody's becoming pretty numb to being baselessly called a racist nowadays.
185280	187840	So, without a reasonable alternative from the left
187840	190040	that doesn't boil down to slanderous lies,
190040	192560	The Great Replacement theory continues to propagate.
192560	196840	Natalism is a problem that affects everyone in the world.
196840	199920	Anyone who has been born is a victim of childbirth.
199920	201720	So, let's look at some facts.
201720	204040	The UN commissioned a study on the topic.
204040	205360	Replacement migration.
205360	208280	Is it a solution to declining and aging populations?
208280	211520	United Nations projections indicate that over the next 50 years,
211520	215000	the populations of virtually all countries of Europe as well as Japan
215000	217840	will face population decline and population aging.
217840	220760	The new challenges of declining and aging populations
220760	225000	will require comprehensive reassessments of many established policies and programs,
225000	227480	including those relating to international migration.
227480	229960	Now, this is actually the conversation that needs to happen.
229960	233680	There's a practical concern regarding replacement fertility in Western nations right now.
233680	236440	And immigration is one possible practical answer.
236440	240440	In my opinion, it's not a very good answer if it comes at the expense of social cohesion.
240440	244840	In the past, when various populations migrated to the United States or Canada or whatever,
244840	247560	they did so in order to become Americans and Canadians.
247560	250560	Yeah, Chinatowns and Little Italy's did and do exist.
250560	254080	But in a couple of generations, most of those people integrated.
254080	257880	Frankly, if we're not taking in people from culturally similar nations as our own,
257880	262280	and the people that we do take in aren't willing to assimilate into our host culture over time,
262280	266840	it's going to cause a lot of problems down the road, regardless of the race of the people involved.
266840	273320	Race is ultimately a non-factor if people move to America to be Americans, not hyphen Americans.
273320	277640	Of course, to even discuss this topic in any way other than being an open borders advocate
277640	279880	makes you a racist in the eyes of the radical left.
279880	283400	And so despite its flaws, the great replacement theory marches on.
283400	285760	So when are you guys going to have babies?
285760	289200	Um, I don't even think about that.
289200	289680	Don't?
289680	293120	No, no, you're like, dude, like, I don't want to have a kid right now.
293120	297920	And she's like, I want to have babies or no, no, no, not at all.
297920	299120	When are you guys going to have kids?
299840	300160	Never.
302320	305840	Alongside immigration, the other half of the theory is about the white birth rate.
305840	307600	Without a sustainable birth rate,
307600	312080	non-white immigration into white countries will effectively breed out the white race.
312080	315200	At least this is what proponents of the great replacement theory believe.
315200	318080	But disregarding the fact that even with the low fertility rate,
318080	322000	there's more white people alive today than there ever has been in the history of the world,
322000	325760	there's also the fact that a falling birth rate is not a uniquely white phenomenon.
325760	328720	And I'm not just talking about Japan and South Korea and Taiwan,
328720	331120	places that sport some of the lowest fertility rates on earth
331120	334640	while simultaneously consisting of Asian, not white populations.
334640	339040	But we're seeing the beginnings of a substantial birth rate decline in half of the world's nations.
339040	340960	And that trend doesn't seem to be reversing.
340960	344560	Now, for example, if you were a white nationalist and you took a look at this graph,
344560	346400	it would be all doom and gloom, wouldn't it?
346400	348640	Replacement fertility rate is 2.1.
348640	352320	Your average woman needs to have 2.1 kids to keep the population growing.
352320	355760	Below the 2.1 line are a bunch of European and Asian countries,
355760	358720	and above it are a bunch of African and Middle Eastern countries.
358720	362000	And if you were that white nationalist, you'd say the writing's on the wall
362000	364560	and confidently close the study, secure in your thinking.
364560	368720	But the very next graph shows fertility rates over a 50-year time span,
368720	370080	and it paints a clear picture.
370080	374400	Yeah, Kenya's fertility rate is 4, but in 1970 it was 8.
374400	376480	Botswana's gone from 6 to 3.
376480	379040	South Africa's gone from 5 to 2.5.
379040	382720	Across all human populations, regardless of race or culture,
382720	386480	fertility rates tend to decline as technology and education continues to advance.
386480	390080	It's no secret that the third world is finally beginning to enter the modern era,
390080	392960	nearly a century after we did, but it's now happening.
392960	397920	So why wouldn't their birth rates also be dropping towards that dreaded 2.1 mark over time as well?
397920	400320	White and Asian-majority countries got there first,
400320	404000	because white and Asian-majority countries also became technologically advanced
404000	406880	and educated first, but in at most 100 years,
406880	410240	the third world will face the same fertility problems we're facing now.
410240	414320	Sorry, alt-right, but I don't think your dreaded brown horde is coming.
414320	420000	But I think it's a very bad idea to have kids, especially nowadays, in this modern era.
420640	423440	Another component of the Great Replacement Theory is the push
423440	426800	through media and culture to socialize white people to not have kids.
426800	429840	And maybe, unlike everything else we've been discussing so far,
429840	432080	there's actually something to this part of the theory.
432160	435600	Why not fund the welfare state with a 100% inheritance tax?
435600	439840	The idea that we should be able to pass on our life's accumulated wealth is deeply embedded.
439840	442480	But imagine if we could use that money for the greater good,
442480	446080	because having kids is no longer considered the greater good in our culture,
446080	448720	for basically the first time in our very long history.
448720	452000	How the biggest passion killer for men is trying for a baby.
452000	457120	Attempting to start a family is worse than depression, tiredness, or even erectile dysfunction.
457120	460720	Well, I could introduce you to many an internet fetishist that would disagree,
460720	462160	but the argument is clear.
462160	465120	Sex is no fun if you have to take care of a baby afterwards.
465120	468240	And sex being no fun is the more important thing to consider.
468240	472880	Having children lowers women's lifetime earnings, an outcome known as the child penalty.
472880	475760	Don't have kids. You'll lose your money and career.
475760	478320	Be a strong independent woman who don't need no man.
478320	480560	Until you're 40 and you hate your life, anyway.
480560	483920	Americans value equality more at work than equality at home.
483920	485120	Hey women, hear that?
485120	487520	You're only considered equal if you're not a stay-at-home mom.
487520	491600	If you value equality, you'll forget all about that pesky family thing you've been wanting.
491600	494640	Is it unethical for people to pass their wealth on to their children?
494640	497840	Give it all to the state. Your family is subordinate to the nation.
497840	499440	Your property rights don't matter.
499440	502160	Just don't do it. Why you shouldn't have kids.
502160	505520	So your friends are accidentally, on purpose, having children,
505520	509760	giving each other rings, and doing beautiful, real, rewarding things.
509760	511200	This is why you're not.
511200	514480	This article is particularly special. Of course, it's from Vice.
514560	518960	Maybe you're like me, in your late 20s and starting to feel like you're in the autumn of your life.
518960	522000	Okay, maybe not autumn, but summer is definitely getting colder.
522000	526720	The drug-taking and regular, baggage-free sex is slowing down.
526720	528800	But we're also not dead, so that's nice.
528800	531440	Friends are starting to accidentally, on purpose, have children,
531440	534720	give each other rings, and do beautiful, real, rewarding things together.
534720	535920	And there you are.
535920	539440	In bed on a Saturday at 4pm in yesterday's underwear.
539440	540400	Watching Netflix.
540400	543280	Texting your housemate to open the door for your menu log guy,
543280	545120	because you can't bring yourself to go out there.
545120	548400	I ward off those confused, jealous, self-pitying pangs
548400	550720	when a friend reaches a milestone that's light years ahead of me,
550720	552720	by reminding myself milestones are forever.
552720	554320	This goes especially for kids.
554320	556960	You can't divorce kids for a dude you met in Belize.
556960	558720	To be clear, my friend's children are beautiful,
558720	561920	and when they fall asleep in my arms I feel like the chaotic nature of existence
561920	563360	makes a tiny bit of sense.
563360	565440	But there's a lot of fuckness ahead for parents.
565440	567200	How do you know your kid won't be an asshole?
567200	570000	And what if they get pregnant at 15 and you're a grandparent at 40?
570000	573200	I find keeping that stuff in the forefront of your mind gets me through.
573200	575600	This person's life sounds so empty.
575600	578400	By my late 20s, I was getting pretty fucking tired
578400	580720	of the nonsense I had got up to in my early 20s.
580720	583040	And this person also sounds like they're tired of it too,
583040	586800	but since they can't find anybody who can actually stand them for longer than one night,
586800	589840	they're deep in denial about how the party ended a few years ago.
589840	593200	There's very good reasons to not have kids, don't get me wrong,
593200	595040	but none of them are presented here.
595040	599120	The only thing here is rationalization is designed to cover up loneliness.
599120	600400	Here's another vice a-
600400	601360	AHHH!
601360	604800	Jesus, I didn't expect that to be staring me in the face when I clicked the link.
604800	608960	The people choosing to be sterilized in their 20s, inside the child-free movement.
608960	612880	I'm actually a proponent of child freedom on the grounds of individual human rights and autonomy,
612880	615200	but you also probably shouldn't be getting sterilized
615200	617280	until a lot of other pieces in your life are set.
617280	620400	Sterilization is something that should probably happen when you have a committed partner
620400	624720	and you've both seriously decided that you're not having any more, or any at all.
624720	626160	But listen to this clown.
626160	627760	I honestly don't like kids.
627760	630160	They're germy and annoying and gross.
630160	631680	The 19 year old explains.
631680	633840	Hey, uh, Caitlin from Philadelphia?
633840	635280	You're still a kid yourself.
635280	637840	Puberty doesn't even end until 25.
637840	642080	I know that some people know they don't want kids from a young age, and that's fine,
642080	645680	but it's also exceedingly rare for them to keep that attitude as they mature.
645680	647600	Motherhood is bad for a woman's health.
647600	649600	Alright, I'm sure it is on some level.
649600	652000	But here's something off to the side that I've noticed.
652080	656240	There's a lot of stock photos of race-mixed families in a whole ton of articles.
656240	657520	That's fine, of course.
657520	661120	But why is it that on the articles that paint parenthood in a negative light,
661120	663440	it's almost always entirely white families?
664320	665040	Huh.
665040	665760	Makes you think.
666320	668000	Parents, the children will be fine.
668000	669280	Spend their inheritance.
669280	671120	Don't leave anything to your kids.
671120	672000	Give it to charity.
672000	672880	Give it to the state.
672880	673760	Spend it frivolously.
673760	674560	Who cares?
674560	676400	Just make sure you neglect your family.
676400	677840	It's a moral imperative.
677840	681600	Millennials are buying homes because of their dogs, not their children or marriages.
681600	684320	Is this another example of millennials ruining everything?
684320	686880	It should be illegal to be a stay-at-home mom.
686880	688720	You know, we've come full circle.
688720	692080	At one point in history, the state forced women to stay in the house,
692080	694960	using violence when necessary to keep them compliant.
694960	698160	And after years of struggle, women have finally won the right
698160	701040	to have the state use violence on them to get them to leave the house.
701600	702400	Feminism.
702400	704880	And we haven't even gotten to the cheating part of it.
704880	706080	Oh, the cheating.
706080	709440	Why men should give their wives a cheat pass this Christmas.
709440	712160	My wife wants to have a baby, but says it won't be mine.
712160	716080	When a boyfriend joins the marriage, they agreed she could have sex on the side
716080	718080	as long as he didn't have to know about it.
718080	719520	Then she fell in love.
719520	720720	Modern love.
720720	723280	I kiss one good night, but not the other.
723280	726480	One is my boyfriend of 10 years, the other is my husband.
726480	730160	I secretly date people who aren't my boyfriend, but I don't think it's cheating.
730160	732080	All right, allow me to set the stage.
732080	736560	Let's say you're a shitty female journo, living in your hyper-left urban bubble.
736560	740400	Empowered by the feminarchy, you enjoy sexual encounters behind the back
740400	742560	of your soy boy beta male boyfriend.
742560	746400	And despite your best efforts, you're both close to being discovered
746400	750880	and there's some deep, dark, problematic part of you that feels guilty about what you've done.
750880	756240	Do you A. Come clean like an adult, face the consequence of a messy breakup,
756240	761040	but use the opportunity to polish yourself up and work towards a healthier way of living?
761040	766720	Or B. Write articles normalizing infidelity in the hopes that society will take your side
766720	769120	in being an absolutely shit human being.
769120	774400	And we've got everybody's favorite drool sock, Ocasio-Cortez, asking the tough questions.
774400	776000	Is it okay to still have children?
776720	778480	Well, maybe not for you.
778480	783120	Ocasio-Cortez, the private citizen, is free to have as many shitty takes as she likes.
783120	787040	Ocasio-Cortez, the elected official, has no business asking whether or not
787040	789360	it's appropriate for the population to be reproducing.
789360	791200	That is not the domain of the government.
791200	793280	And yet things are now trending that way.
793280	796000	Gay and trans lessons for primary school students.
796000	800080	In my opinion, it's probably a bit young to be learning about anything sexual at the age of five,
800080	802960	gay or straight, but you'd be a bigot if you objected.
802960	806720	Just like how this dad was a bigot because he objected to his kids having to write
806720	809520	about their conversion to Islam as a school assignment.
809520	813440	If there's one part of the great replacement theory that actually holds water,
813440	815920	it's the push to normalize not having kids.
815920	821120	They began by attacking masculinity and fatherhood like it's inherently flawed and always toxic.
821120	823120	And now they're coming for motherhood and femininity,
823120	826720	like it's a social, financial, and as existential burden on women's equality.
826720	830400	It's a genderless blob agenda where men are like women and women are like men.
830400	833840	Where children are encouraged to be gay or trans at the drop of a hat.
833840	837600	And if you object, the government takes them away because they aren't your kids,
837600	838720	they're the state's kids.
838720	841280	Where wanting to be a stay-at-home mom is problematic,
841280	843920	or wanting to be a strong father figure is oppressive.
843920	848080	Where the complimentary support that men and women bring to each other is actively campaigned
848080	851600	against for a few fleeting moments of freedom from responsibility,
851600	853920	followed by a rapid descent into chaos.
853920	858080	I'm not saying that men wanting to be like women, women wanting to be like men,
858080	862240	people wanting to be gay or trans, whatever, I'm not saying that's bad.
862240	866000	If that's your natural proclivity, all the power to you, go off and enjoy your life.
866000	870560	But there's certainly a cultural push right now to put that on people who may simply be confused,
870640	873920	or on the fence, or having other unrelated problems.
873920	876560	And if it ends up not being what they want out of their life,
876560	878960	their experimentation is often to their detriment,
878960	882400	and then that detriment itself is considered oppressive.
882400	885840	Nothing has damaged both modern society and the individual
885840	888080	more than the destruction of the nuclear family.
888080	891760	Radical feminists talk about smashing the nuclear family all the time,
891760	893920	and they do so at their own peril.
893920	897200	Reasons like these, many more,
897760	901360	and the fact that I don't like to leave things of this magnitude to chance,
902800	906480	all informed my decision to become surgically sterilized.
907040	910800	However, even as this part of the great replacement theory holds water,
910800	914160	it doesn't do so for the reasons the alt-right thinks it does.
914160	918000	It's not part of some grand Jewish plot to breed out the white race
918000	920000	in order to seize direct political power.
920000	922400	Of course, I know there are some within the Democratic Party
922400	925440	that have directly stated this to be their goal, surprisingly enough.
925440	927360	It's no secret that demographic change,
927360	929680	rather than any serious attempt to change policy,
929680	932160	is why California went from Republican to Democrat,
932160	934560	and verifieds on Twitter are thinly veiled
934560	937200	in their endorsement of that tactic in other locations.
937200	941520	In Why the Announcement of a Looming White Minority Makes Demographers Nervous,
941520	945280	Dr. Myers watched as progressives, envisioning political power,
945280	948240	became enamored with the idea of a coming white minority.
948240	951680	He said it was hard to interest them in his work on ways to make the change
951680	954480	seem less threatening to the fearful white Americans.
954480	957360	For instance, by emphasizing the good that can come from immigration.
957360	958400	It was conquest.
958400	960480	Our day has come, he said of their reaction.
960480	962640	They wanted to overpower them with numbers.
962640	964400	It was demographic destiny.
964400	965520	And you know what?
965520	966160	I get it.
966160	969840	A white nationalist reading that article would screech that he was right all along,
969840	973200	and grabbing a tiki torch, loudly exclaim he would not be replaced.
973200	974960	But big picture here.
974960	977120	Do you actually think the Democratic Party,
977120	978880	even if they were willing to do so,
978880	981200	is competent enough to manage a secret scheme
981200	983280	to replace all white people with immigrants?
983280	984000	No.
984000	988160	They're not even competent enough to win elections while having decisive advantages.
988160	991280	There's a simpler solution to everything the Great Replacement talks about.
991280	995200	In terms of the overwhelming media and culture push normalizing not having kids,
995200	998480	through cheating, through transitioning, through just not having them,
998480	1001760	it's less likely to be a Jewish conspiracy to lower the white birth rate,
1001760	1005520	and more likely to be yet another social justice push at equalization.
1005520	1007600	If all modes of living are morally valid,
1007600	1010560	then they all need to be represented equally across the population.
1010560	1012960	Of course, that's wrong for other reasons,
1012960	1015760	but with the fringe exception of the don't perpetuate whiteness,
1015760	1019120	stop having white babies crowd, it's not about white fertility.
1019120	1022160	We've already seen that technology and education have a far greater impact
1022160	1023280	on everybody's fertility,
1023280	1026800	and that a massive population crash across all races is on the way.
1026800	1028240	And as for the media push,
1028240	1031520	it really just seems to be a bunch of lonely, guilty individuals
1031520	1034000	trying to justify their loneliness and their guilt.
1034000	1035440	In terms of immigration,
1035440	1040240	while there might be racist lunatics in the SJW wings of some political parties,
1040240	1042320	masturbating to the idea of a white genocide,
1042320	1045520	they lack both the power and the competence to actually pull it off.
1045520	1048880	It's far more likely that unfettered immigration is a corporatist push
1048880	1050560	to lower the cost of unskilled labour
1050560	1052880	by flooding the marketplace with able-bodied workers,
1052880	1057280	and the social, cultural, racial, and religious consequences of that action
1057280	1058800	simply don't matter to them.
1058800	1062640	But some people see all of this and take the shortcut to white replacement.
1062640	1067440	Why is the CBC telling Canadians to have fewer children to reduce our carbon footprint,
1067440	1070000	while at the same time advocating for increased immigration
1070000	1071520	to make up for declining birth rates?
1071520	1074640	If having fewer people in Canada is good for the environment,
1074640	1077120	why bring in one million new people per year?
1077120	1078240	That's a fair question.
1078880	1081600	The answer is probably something like the common question of
1081600	1085120	why have your own kids when there's orphaned ones out there who need to be adopted?
1085120	1087840	There's a clear difference between people who don't yet exist
1087840	1089920	and people who do but live somewhere else.
1089920	1092400	This doesn't make me an advocate for the migration of
1092400	1095520	one million workers a year into Canada from Islamic countries,
1095520	1097680	but this person is asking the wrong question.
1097680	1099200	Approaching the problem from this angle
1099200	1101760	makes you incapable of offering any real solutions.
1101760	1103360	In the end, regardless of any other factor,
1103360	1106480	there will always be a percentage of the population that will never have kids,
1106480	1109120	no matter how easy their society makes it to have them.
1109120	1112800	And conversely, there will always be a percentage of the population that will always have kids,
1112800	1115120	no matter how hard their society makes it to have them.
1115120	1116800	And both of these things are fine.
1116800	1119280	People are free to do what they like with their lives,
1119280	1122400	even if they choose to lead lives completely devoid of meaning.
1122400	1125440	I'm not saying that having kids is the only path to a meaningful life.
1125440	1126720	There's obviously others.
1126800	1130320	But having kids is very clearly one common path
1130320	1132400	that applies to almost all people on the planet.
1132400	1134960	And this is coming from somebody who doesn't want kids himself.
1134960	1138320	But if the complaint is that white people aren't having kids anymore,
1138320	1141600	we don't need to look at absurd claims like Jewish conspiracies
1141600	1143680	or waves of hostile immigrants or whatever,
1143680	1146400	framing the conversation in this way as a non-starter.
1146400	1149600	Liberalism holds that the individual is more important than the group,
1149600	1153600	that individual human rights constitute a functioning society's first priority,
1153600	1157840	and that, seemingly paradoxically, through exclusive protection of the individual,
1157840	1159840	the group also ends up being protected.
1159840	1163760	Enshrining the supremacy of the individual allows the group to flourish.
1163760	1167440	Other competing political philosophies that begin with group rights
1167440	1169760	sacrifice individuals in the name of the group,
1169760	1173360	and ultimately cause the failure of the group in the long term anyway.
1173360	1178560	If, in a free society, the goals of the individual and the goals of the group are not in alignment.
1178560	1180880	And I do think the alignment of the two forces,
1180960	1185120	rather than one being subservient to the other, is the proper way to conceptualize this,
1185120	1187520	then individuals will be less likely to want kids.
1187520	1192000	Swinging too far to the individualistic side of things leads to an over-reliance on rights,
1192000	1193520	as important as rights are,
1193520	1197120	cultivating a type of narcissism where people are unwilling to give up their position
1197120	1199600	as the center of their own lives to a hypothetical child.
1199600	1202640	On the other hand, swinging too far to the collectivist side of things
1202640	1204320	leads to an authoritarian state,
1204320	1207360	where the structure of the nation is willing to consume its own populace
1207360	1209040	in order to maintain its bureaucracy.
1209040	1211680	And we've seen that, under exceptionally harsh conditions,
1211680	1214400	human fertility falls as people wait to have kids,
1214400	1215920	hoping the future will be better.
1215920	1218560	Unless the state forces all women to be constantly pregnant,
1218560	1220400	the way that Romania did, for example,
1220400	1222560	which leads to its own particular horror show.
1222560	1226000	But when the interests of the individual and the interests of the group align,
1226000	1227760	not only does the birth rate improve,
1227760	1232720	but so does investment, education, entrepreneurship, technological advancement,
1232720	1236160	basically most of the domains required in order to have a fulfilled life.
1236160	1238640	The alt-right may be a great lover of fascism,
1238640	1241840	but ironically enough, their goal of an improved birth rate
1241840	1245120	would be fulfilled not through the heavy hand of a tyrannical regime,
1245120	1249840	but by a non-interfering, Night Watchmen-styled, democratically elected government.
1249840	1252400	The theory of the Great Replacement is a joke.
1252400	1254880	It identifies problems, though not accurately.
1254880	1257760	It fails to identify the correct causes for those problems,
1257760	1262480	and it offers solutions to those problems that are not only wildly incorrect and dysfunctional,
1262480	1267120	but that also lead to bloodbaths, as history has unfortunately shown us.
1267120	1271520	For as much as both Nazis and Communists hate liberals,
1271520	1275600	liberalism is the only political ideology compatible with human life.
