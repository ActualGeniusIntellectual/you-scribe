1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
I first met Andy online.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,040
Andy chooses not to identify as a specific gender,

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,400
so has asked to be referred to as they.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,240
I went to see Andy the night before the sterilisation.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,960
Ooh. Hello, kitty cat.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,840
What's the cat's name? Peppy.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,520
Peppy? Yeah.

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,600
Hello, Peppy.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,400
Why are you doing this? What's motivated you?

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,880
I don't know. I just feel like I shouldn't be having children

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,520
and I don't want to, you know...

12
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,520
..mental health problems and things like that.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,640
I just don't want to have to pass things on.

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,040
I don't know, I just... And obviously the work that I do,

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,120
I just don't want to accidentally fall pregnant.

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,080
That would be awful.

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,520
And what kind of work do you do?

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,160
I'm a sex worker.

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,640
So, yeah, there's more, I guess,

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,760
more risk of getting pregnant, in a way,

21
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,880
because I'm having a lot of sex.

22
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,880
Um...

23
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,920
Ooh. Is that my slippers?

24
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,720
Yeah, I did notice that. I do like them.

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,520
It's not My Little Pony, it's, um... It is.

26
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,080
Oh, it is My Little Pony!

27
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,720
Is that your dad? No, it's my uncle.

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,320
No, I never met my dad.

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,960
You never met him? No.

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,200
You've got, you know, My Pony. My Little Pony.

31
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,360
My Little Pony. You've got...

32
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,000
..Mr Squidgy, the hair in the middle.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,840
I mean, you know, they're dolls and ponies.

34
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,560
It's something that children have.

35
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,960
And yet, tomorrow, you're getting permanently sterilised.

36
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,760
Yeah. I'm, like, a five-year-old child in an adult body.

37
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,880
Um, yeah, I don't know.

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,520
I guess, like, I had a really difficult childhood,

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,360
and for most of it, I wasn't able to be a child.

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,880
So I kind of, like, am, like,

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,840
reliving my childhood, but, like, as an adult.

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,280
Do you talk to your mum? No, no, no.

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,720
My mum disowned me.

44
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,640
So, no, I don't want to have a mother.

45
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,880
The New Zealand Shooters Manifesto was titled The Great Replacement,

46
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,200
a reference to the Great Replacement conspiracy theory

47
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,680
that the far-right has believed in for quite a while now.

48
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,000
The basic premise is that the unfettered immigration

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,520
of non-white people into white-majority countries,

50
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,200
alongside a socially engineered cultural shift

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,120
towards white people not wanting children,

52
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,800
will eventually lead to the replacement of the white populations with non-whites.

53
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,320
Or so the theory goes.

54
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,360
The theory itself is taking centre stage

55
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,200
due to the aforementioned shootings right now,

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,240
with the New York Times calling it a racist, sexist doctrine.

57
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,800
I don't see how it could be sexist, but racist?

58
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,240
I'd say that's probable.

59
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,600
However, I don't think anybody actually expects

60
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,960
a serious, unbiased analysis of the facts from the New York Times anymore.

61
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,280
To the left-leaning media and the SJWs on their staff,

62
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,160
The Great Replacement is racist,

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,080
because it's a rightist take on race relations.

64
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,520
The facts of the theory don't actually matter.

65
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,240
And unfortunately, the right is the only group at the moment

66
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,040
actually having the race discussion.

67
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,080
The left simply calls you a racist,

68
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,440
if you even entertain the idea of an open discussion on race.

69
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,400
And while that might have worked a decade ago,

70
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,280
everybody's becoming pretty numb to being baselessly called a racist nowadays.

71
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,840
So, without a reasonable alternative from the left

72
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,040
that doesn't boil down to slanderous lies,

73
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,560
The Great Replacement theory continues to propagate.

74
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,840
Natalism is a problem that affects everyone in the world.

75
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,920
Anyone who has been born is a victim of childbirth.

76
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,720
So, let's look at some facts.

77
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,040
The UN commissioned a study on the topic.

78
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,360
Replacement migration.

79
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,280
Is it a solution to declining and aging populations?

80
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,520
United Nations projections indicate that over the next 50 years,

81
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,000
the populations of virtually all countries of Europe as well as Japan

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,840
will face population decline and population aging.

83
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,760
The new challenges of declining and aging populations

84
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,000
will require comprehensive reassessments of many established policies and programs,

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,480
including those relating to international migration.

86
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,960
Now, this is actually the conversation that needs to happen.

87
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,680
There's a practical concern regarding replacement fertility in Western nations right now.

88
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,440
And immigration is one possible practical answer.

89
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,440
In my opinion, it's not a very good answer if it comes at the expense of social cohesion.

90
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,840
In the past, when various populations migrated to the United States or Canada or whatever,

91
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,560
they did so in order to become Americans and Canadians.

92
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,560
Yeah, Chinatowns and Little Italy's did and do exist.

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,080
But in a couple of generations, most of those people integrated.

94
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,880
Frankly, if we're not taking in people from culturally similar nations as our own,

95
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,280
and the people that we do take in aren't willing to assimilate into our host culture over time,

96
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,840
it's going to cause a lot of problems down the road, regardless of the race of the people involved.

97
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,320
Race is ultimately a non-factor if people move to America to be Americans, not hyphen Americans.

98
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,640
Of course, to even discuss this topic in any way other than being an open borders advocate

99
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,880
makes you a racist in the eyes of the radical left.

100
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,400
And so despite its flaws, the great replacement theory marches on.

101
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,760
So when are you guys going to have babies?

102
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,200
Um, I don't even think about that.

103
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,680
Don't?

104
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,120
No, no, you're like, dude, like, I don't want to have a kid right now.

105
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,920
And she's like, I want to have babies or no, no, no, not at all.

106
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,120
When are you guys going to have kids?

107
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,160
Never.

108
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,840
Alongside immigration, the other half of the theory is about the white birth rate.

109
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,600
Without a sustainable birth rate,

110
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,080
non-white immigration into white countries will effectively breed out the white race.

111
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,200
At least this is what proponents of the great replacement theory believe.

112
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,080
But disregarding the fact that even with the low fertility rate,

113
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,000
there's more white people alive today than there ever has been in the history of the world,

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,760
there's also the fact that a falling birth rate is not a uniquely white phenomenon.

115
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,720
And I'm not just talking about Japan and South Korea and Taiwan,

116
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,120
places that sport some of the lowest fertility rates on earth

117
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,640
while simultaneously consisting of Asian, not white populations.

118
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,040
But we're seeing the beginnings of a substantial birth rate decline in half of the world's nations.

119
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,960
And that trend doesn't seem to be reversing.

120
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,560
Now, for example, if you were a white nationalist and you took a look at this graph,

121
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,400
it would be all doom and gloom, wouldn't it?

122
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,640
Replacement fertility rate is 2.1.

123
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,320
Your average woman needs to have 2.1 kids to keep the population growing.

124
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,760
Below the 2.1 line are a bunch of European and Asian countries,

125
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,720
and above it are a bunch of African and Middle Eastern countries.

126
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,000
And if you were that white nationalist, you'd say the writing's on the wall

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,560
and confidently close the study, secure in your thinking.

128
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,720
But the very next graph shows fertility rates over a 50-year time span,

129
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,080
and it paints a clear picture.

130
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,400
Yeah, Kenya's fertility rate is 4, but in 1970 it was 8.

131
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,480
Botswana's gone from 6 to 3.

132
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,040
South Africa's gone from 5 to 2.5.

133
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,720
Across all human populations, regardless of race or culture,

134
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,480
fertility rates tend to decline as technology and education continues to advance.

135
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,080
It's no secret that the third world is finally beginning to enter the modern era,

136
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,960
nearly a century after we did, but it's now happening.

137
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,920
So why wouldn't their birth rates also be dropping towards that dreaded 2.1 mark over time as well?

138
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,320
White and Asian-majority countries got there first,

139
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,000
because white and Asian-majority countries also became technologically advanced

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,880
and educated first, but in at most 100 years,

141
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,240
the third world will face the same fertility problems we're facing now.

142
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,320
Sorry, alt-right, but I don't think your dreaded brown horde is coming.

143
00:06:54,320 --> 00:07:00,000
But I think it's a very bad idea to have kids, especially nowadays, in this modern era.

144
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,440
Another component of the Great Replacement Theory is the push

145
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,800
through media and culture to socialize white people to not have kids.

146
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,840
And maybe, unlike everything else we've been discussing so far,

147
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,080
there's actually something to this part of the theory.

148
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,600
Why not fund the welfare state with a 100% inheritance tax?

149
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,840
The idea that we should be able to pass on our life's accumulated wealth is deeply embedded.

150
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,480
But imagine if we could use that money for the greater good,

151
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,080
because having kids is no longer considered the greater good in our culture,

152
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,720
for basically the first time in our very long history.

153
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,000
How the biggest passion killer for men is trying for a baby.

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,120
Attempting to start a family is worse than depression, tiredness, or even erectile dysfunction.

155
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,720
Well, I could introduce you to many an internet fetishist that would disagree,

156
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,160
but the argument is clear.

157
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,120
Sex is no fun if you have to take care of a baby afterwards.

158
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,240
And sex being no fun is the more important thing to consider.

159
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,880
Having children lowers women's lifetime earnings, an outcome known as the child penalty.

160
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,760
Don't have kids. You'll lose your money and career.

161
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,320
Be a strong independent woman who don't need no man.

162
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,560
Until you're 40 and you hate your life, anyway.

163
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,920
Americans value equality more at work than equality at home.

164
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,120
Hey women, hear that?

165
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,520
You're only considered equal if you're not a stay-at-home mom.

166
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,600
If you value equality, you'll forget all about that pesky family thing you've been wanting.

167
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,640
Is it unethical for people to pass their wealth on to their children?

168
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,840
Give it all to the state. Your family is subordinate to the nation.

169
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,440
Your property rights don't matter.

170
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,160
Just don't do it. Why you shouldn't have kids.

171
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,520
So your friends are accidentally, on purpose, having children,

172
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,760
giving each other rings, and doing beautiful, real, rewarding things.

173
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,200
This is why you're not.

174
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,480
This article is particularly special. Of course, it's from Vice.

175
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,960
Maybe you're like me, in your late 20s and starting to feel like you're in the autumn of your life.

176
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay, maybe not autumn, but summer is definitely getting colder.

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,720
The drug-taking and regular, baggage-free sex is slowing down.

178
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,800
But we're also not dead, so that's nice.

179
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,440
Friends are starting to accidentally, on purpose, have children,

180
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,720
give each other rings, and do beautiful, real, rewarding things together.

181
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,920
And there you are.

182
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,440
In bed on a Saturday at 4pm in yesterday's underwear.

183
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,400
Watching Netflix.

184
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,280
Texting your housemate to open the door for your menu log guy,

185
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,120
because you can't bring yourself to go out there.

186
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,400
I ward off those confused, jealous, self-pitying pangs

187
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,720
when a friend reaches a milestone that's light years ahead of me,

188
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
by reminding myself milestones are forever.

189
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,320
This goes especially for kids.

190
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,960
You can't divorce kids for a dude you met in Belize.

191
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,720
To be clear, my friend's children are beautiful,

192
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,920
and when they fall asleep in my arms I feel like the chaotic nature of existence

193
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,360
makes a tiny bit of sense.

194
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,440
But there's a lot of fuckness ahead for parents.

195
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,200
How do you know your kid won't be an asshole?

196
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,000
And what if they get pregnant at 15 and you're a grandparent at 40?

197
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,200
I find keeping that stuff in the forefront of your mind gets me through.

198
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,600
This person's life sounds so empty.

199
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,400
By my late 20s, I was getting pretty fucking tired

200
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,720
of the nonsense I had got up to in my early 20s.

201
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,040
And this person also sounds like they're tired of it too,

202
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,800
but since they can't find anybody who can actually stand them for longer than one night,

203
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,840
they're deep in denial about how the party ended a few years ago.

204
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,200
There's very good reasons to not have kids, don't get me wrong,

205
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,040
but none of them are presented here.

206
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,120
The only thing here is rationalization is designed to cover up loneliness.

207
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,400
Here's another vice a-

208
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,360
AHHH!

209
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,800
Jesus, I didn't expect that to be staring me in the face when I clicked the link.

210
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,960
The people choosing to be sterilized in their 20s, inside the child-free movement.

211
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,880
I'm actually a proponent of child freedom on the grounds of individual human rights and autonomy,

212
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,200
but you also probably shouldn't be getting sterilized

213
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,280
until a lot of other pieces in your life are set.

214
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,400
Sterilization is something that should probably happen when you have a committed partner

215
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,720
and you've both seriously decided that you're not having any more, or any at all.

216
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,160
But listen to this clown.

217
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,760
I honestly don't like kids.

218
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,160
They're germy and annoying and gross.

219
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,680
The 19 year old explains.

220
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,840
Hey, uh, Caitlin from Philadelphia?

221
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,280
You're still a kid yourself.

222
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,840
Puberty doesn't even end until 25.

223
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,080
I know that some people know they don't want kids from a young age, and that's fine,

224
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,680
but it's also exceedingly rare for them to keep that attitude as they mature.

225
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,600
Motherhood is bad for a woman's health.

226
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Alright, I'm sure it is on some level.

227
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,000
But here's something off to the side that I've noticed.

228
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,240
There's a lot of stock photos of race-mixed families in a whole ton of articles.

229
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,520
That's fine, of course.

230
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,120
But why is it that on the articles that paint parenthood in a negative light,

231
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,440
it's almost always entirely white families?

232
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,040
Huh.

233
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,760
Makes you think.

234
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,000
Parents, the children will be fine.

235
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,280
Spend their inheritance.

236
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,120
Don't leave anything to your kids.

237
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,000
Give it to charity.

238
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,880
Give it to the state.

239
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,760
Spend it frivolously.

240
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,560
Who cares?

241
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,400
Just make sure you neglect your family.

242
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,840
It's a moral imperative.

243
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,600
Millennials are buying homes because of their dogs, not their children or marriages.

244
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,320
Is this another example of millennials ruining everything?

245
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,880
It should be illegal to be a stay-at-home mom.

246
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,720
You know, we've come full circle.

247
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,080
At one point in history, the state forced women to stay in the house,

248
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,960
using violence when necessary to keep them compliant.

249
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,160
And after years of struggle, women have finally won the right

250
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,040
to have the state use violence on them to get them to leave the house.

251
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,400
Feminism.

252
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,880
And we haven't even gotten to the cheating part of it.

253
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,080
Oh, the cheating.

254
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,440
Why men should give their wives a cheat pass this Christmas.

255
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,160
My wife wants to have a baby, but says it won't be mine.

256
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,080
When a boyfriend joins the marriage, they agreed she could have sex on the side

257
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,080
as long as he didn't have to know about it.

258
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,520
Then she fell in love.

259
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,720
Modern love.

260
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,280
I kiss one good night, but not the other.

261
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,480
One is my boyfriend of 10 years, the other is my husband.

262
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,160
I secretly date people who aren't my boyfriend, but I don't think it's cheating.

263
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,080
All right, allow me to set the stage.

264
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,560
Let's say you're a shitty female journo, living in your hyper-left urban bubble.

265
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,400
Empowered by the feminarchy, you enjoy sexual encounters behind the back

266
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,560
of your soy boy beta male boyfriend.

267
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,400
And despite your best efforts, you're both close to being discovered

268
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,880
and there's some deep, dark, problematic part of you that feels guilty about what you've done.

269
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,240
Do you A. Come clean like an adult, face the consequence of a messy breakup,

270
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,040
but use the opportunity to polish yourself up and work towards a healthier way of living?

271
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,720
Or B. Write articles normalizing infidelity in the hopes that society will take your side

272
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,120
in being an absolutely shit human being.

273
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,400
And we've got everybody's favorite drool sock, Ocasio-Cortez, asking the tough questions.

274
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,000
Is it okay to still have children?

275
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,480
Well, maybe not for you.

276
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,120
Ocasio-Cortez, the private citizen, is free to have as many shitty takes as she likes.

277
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,040
Ocasio-Cortez, the elected official, has no business asking whether or not

278
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,360
it's appropriate for the population to be reproducing.

279
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,200
That is not the domain of the government.

280
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,280
And yet things are now trending that way.

281
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,000
Gay and trans lessons for primary school students.

282
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,080
In my opinion, it's probably a bit young to be learning about anything sexual at the age of five,

283
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,960
gay or straight, but you'd be a bigot if you objected.

284
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,720
Just like how this dad was a bigot because he objected to his kids having to write

285
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,520
about their conversion to Islam as a school assignment.

286
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,440
If there's one part of the great replacement theory that actually holds water,

287
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,920
it's the push to normalize not having kids.

288
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,120
They began by attacking masculinity and fatherhood like it's inherently flawed and always toxic.

289
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
And now they're coming for motherhood and femininity,

290
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,720
like it's a social, financial, and as existential burden on women's equality.

291
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,400
It's a genderless blob agenda where men are like women and women are like men.

292
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,840
Where children are encouraged to be gay or trans at the drop of a hat.

293
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,600
And if you object, the government takes them away because they aren't your kids,

294
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,720
they're the state's kids.

295
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,280
Where wanting to be a stay-at-home mom is problematic,

296
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,920
or wanting to be a strong father figure is oppressive.

297
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,080
Where the complimentary support that men and women bring to each other is actively campaigned

298
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,600
against for a few fleeting moments of freedom from responsibility,

299
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,920
followed by a rapid descent into chaos.

300
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,080
I'm not saying that men wanting to be like women, women wanting to be like men,

301
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,240
people wanting to be gay or trans, whatever, I'm not saying that's bad.

302
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,000
If that's your natural proclivity, all the power to you, go off and enjoy your life.

303
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,560
But there's certainly a cultural push right now to put that on people who may simply be confused,

304
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,920
or on the fence, or having other unrelated problems.

305
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,560
And if it ends up not being what they want out of their life,

306
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,960
their experimentation is often to their detriment,

307
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,400
and then that detriment itself is considered oppressive.

308
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,840
Nothing has damaged both modern society and the individual

309
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,080
more than the destruction of the nuclear family.

310
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,760
Radical feminists talk about smashing the nuclear family all the time,

311
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,920
and they do so at their own peril.

312
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,200
Reasons like these, many more,

313
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,360
and the fact that I don't like to leave things of this magnitude to chance,

314
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,480
all informed my decision to become surgically sterilized.

315
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,800
However, even as this part of the great replacement theory holds water,

316
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,160
it doesn't do so for the reasons the alt-right thinks it does.

317
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,000
It's not part of some grand Jewish plot to breed out the white race

318
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
in order to seize direct political power.

319
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,400
Of course, I know there are some within the Democratic Party

320
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,440
that have directly stated this to be their goal, surprisingly enough.

321
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,360
It's no secret that demographic change,

322
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,680
rather than any serious attempt to change policy,

323
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,160
is why California went from Republican to Democrat,

324
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,560
and verifieds on Twitter are thinly veiled

325
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,200
in their endorsement of that tactic in other locations.

326
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,520
In Why the Announcement of a Looming White Minority Makes Demographers Nervous,

327
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,280
Dr. Myers watched as progressives, envisioning political power,

328
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,240
became enamored with the idea of a coming white minority.

329
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,680
He said it was hard to interest them in his work on ways to make the change

330
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,480
seem less threatening to the fearful white Americans.

331
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,360
For instance, by emphasizing the good that can come from immigration.

332
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,400
It was conquest.

333
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,480
Our day has come, he said of their reaction.

334
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,640
They wanted to overpower them with numbers.

335
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,400
It was demographic destiny.

336
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,520
And you know what?

337
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,160
I get it.

338
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,840
A white nationalist reading that article would screech that he was right all along,

339
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,200
and grabbing a tiki torch, loudly exclaim he would not be replaced.

340
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,960
But big picture here.

341
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,120
Do you actually think the Democratic Party,

342
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,880
even if they were willing to do so,

343
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,200
is competent enough to manage a secret scheme

344
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,280
to replace all white people with immigrants?

345
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,000
No.

346
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,160
They're not even competent enough to win elections while having decisive advantages.

347
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,280
There's a simpler solution to everything the Great Replacement talks about.

348
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,200
In terms of the overwhelming media and culture push normalizing not having kids,

349
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,480
through cheating, through transitioning, through just not having them,

350
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,760
it's less likely to be a Jewish conspiracy to lower the white birth rate,

351
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,520
and more likely to be yet another social justice push at equalization.

352
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,600
If all modes of living are morally valid,

353
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,560
then they all need to be represented equally across the population.

354
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,960
Of course, that's wrong for other reasons,

355
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,760
but with the fringe exception of the don't perpetuate whiteness,

356
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,120
stop having white babies crowd, it's not about white fertility.

357
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,160
We've already seen that technology and education have a far greater impact

358
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,280
on everybody's fertility,

359
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,800
and that a massive population crash across all races is on the way.

360
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,240
And as for the media push,

361
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,520
it really just seems to be a bunch of lonely, guilty individuals

362
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,000
trying to justify their loneliness and their guilt.

363
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,440
In terms of immigration,

364
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,240
while there might be racist lunatics in the SJW wings of some political parties,

365
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,320
masturbating to the idea of a white genocide,

366
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,520
they lack both the power and the competence to actually pull it off.

367
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,880
It's far more likely that unfettered immigration is a corporatist push

368
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,560
to lower the cost of unskilled labour

369
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,880
by flooding the marketplace with able-bodied workers,

370
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,280
and the social, cultural, racial, and religious consequences of that action

371
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,800
simply don't matter to them.

372
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,640
But some people see all of this and take the shortcut to white replacement.

373
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,440
Why is the CBC telling Canadians to have fewer children to reduce our carbon footprint,

374
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,000
while at the same time advocating for increased immigration

375
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,520
to make up for declining birth rates?

376
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,640
If having fewer people in Canada is good for the environment,

377
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,120
why bring in one million new people per year?

378
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,240
That's a fair question.

379
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,600
The answer is probably something like the common question of

380
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,120
why have your own kids when there's orphaned ones out there who need to be adopted?

381
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,840
There's a clear difference between people who don't yet exist

382
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,920
and people who do but live somewhere else.

383
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,400
This doesn't make me an advocate for the migration of

384
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,520
one million workers a year into Canada from Islamic countries,

385
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,680
but this person is asking the wrong question.

386
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,200
Approaching the problem from this angle

387
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,760
makes you incapable of offering any real solutions.

388
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,360
In the end, regardless of any other factor,

389
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,480
there will always be a percentage of the population that will never have kids,

390
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,120
no matter how easy their society makes it to have them.

391
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,800
And conversely, there will always be a percentage of the population that will always have kids,

392
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,120
no matter how hard their society makes it to have them.

393
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,800
And both of these things are fine.

394
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,280
People are free to do what they like with their lives,

395
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,400
even if they choose to lead lives completely devoid of meaning.

396
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,440
I'm not saying that having kids is the only path to a meaningful life.

397
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,720
There's obviously others.

398
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,320
But having kids is very clearly one common path

399
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,400
that applies to almost all people on the planet.

400
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,960
And this is coming from somebody who doesn't want kids himself.

401
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,320
But if the complaint is that white people aren't having kids anymore,

402
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,600
we don't need to look at absurd claims like Jewish conspiracies

403
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,680
or waves of hostile immigrants or whatever,

404
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,400
framing the conversation in this way as a non-starter.

405
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,600
Liberalism holds that the individual is more important than the group,

406
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,600
that individual human rights constitute a functioning society's first priority,

407
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,840
and that, seemingly paradoxically, through exclusive protection of the individual,

408
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
the group also ends up being protected.

409
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,760
Enshrining the supremacy of the individual allows the group to flourish.

410
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,440
Other competing political philosophies that begin with group rights

411
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,760
sacrifice individuals in the name of the group,

412
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,360
and ultimately cause the failure of the group in the long term anyway.

413
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,560
If, in a free society, the goals of the individual and the goals of the group are not in alignment.

414
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,880
And I do think the alignment of the two forces,

415
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,120
rather than one being subservient to the other, is the proper way to conceptualize this,

416
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,520
then individuals will be less likely to want kids.

417
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,000
Swinging too far to the individualistic side of things leads to an over-reliance on rights,

418
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,520
as important as rights are,

419
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,120
cultivating a type of narcissism where people are unwilling to give up their position

420
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,600
as the center of their own lives to a hypothetical child.

421
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,640
On the other hand, swinging too far to the collectivist side of things

422
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,320
leads to an authoritarian state,

423
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,360
where the structure of the nation is willing to consume its own populace

424
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,040
in order to maintain its bureaucracy.

425
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,680
And we've seen that, under exceptionally harsh conditions,

426
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,400
human fertility falls as people wait to have kids,

427
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,920
hoping the future will be better.

428
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,560
Unless the state forces all women to be constantly pregnant,

429
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,400
the way that Romania did, for example,

430
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,560
which leads to its own particular horror show.

431
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,000
But when the interests of the individual and the interests of the group align,

432
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,760
not only does the birth rate improve,

433
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,720
but so does investment, education, entrepreneurship, technological advancement,

434
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,160
basically most of the domains required in order to have a fulfilled life.

435
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,640
The alt-right may be a great lover of fascism,

436
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,840
but ironically enough, their goal of an improved birth rate

437
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,120
would be fulfilled not through the heavy hand of a tyrannical regime,

438
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,840
but by a non-interfering, Night Watchmen-styled, democratically elected government.

439
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,400
The theory of the Great Replacement is a joke.

440
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,880
It identifies problems, though not accurately.

441
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,760
It fails to identify the correct causes for those problems,

442
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,480
and it offers solutions to those problems that are not only wildly incorrect and dysfunctional,

443
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,120
but that also lead to bloodbaths, as history has unfortunately shown us.

444
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,520
For as much as both Nazis and Communists hate liberals,

445
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,600
liberalism is the only political ideology compatible with human life.
