00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
I first met Andy online.

00:02.800 --> 00:06.040
Andy chooses not to identify as a specific gender,

00:06.040 --> 00:09.400
so has asked to be referred to as they.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.240
I went to see Andy the night before the sterilisation.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.960
Ooh. Hello, kitty cat.

00:13.960 --> 00:15.840
What's the cat's name? Peppy.

00:15.840 --> 00:17.520
Peppy? Yeah.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.600
Hello, Peppy.

00:19.600 --> 00:23.400
Why are you doing this? What's motivated you?

00:23.400 --> 00:26.880
I don't know. I just feel like I shouldn't be having children

00:26.880 --> 00:28.520
and I don't want to, you know...

00:28.520 --> 00:30.520
..mental health problems and things like that.

00:30.520 --> 00:32.640
I just don't want to have to pass things on.

00:32.640 --> 00:35.040
I don't know, I just... And obviously the work that I do,

00:35.040 --> 00:38.120
I just don't want to accidentally fall pregnant.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.080
That would be awful.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.520
And what kind of work do you do?

00:42.520 --> 00:44.160
I'm a sex worker.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.640
So, yeah, there's more, I guess,

00:46.640 --> 00:48.760
more risk of getting pregnant, in a way,

00:48.760 --> 00:50.880
because I'm having a lot of sex.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.880
Um...

00:52.880 --> 00:54.920
Ooh. Is that my slippers?

00:54.920 --> 00:57.720
Yeah, I did notice that. I do like them.

00:57.960 --> 01:00.520
It's not My Little Pony, it's, um... It is.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.080
Oh, it is My Little Pony!

01:02.080 --> 01:04.720
Is that your dad? No, it's my uncle.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.320
No, I never met my dad.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.960
You never met him? No.

01:09.960 --> 01:12.200
You've got, you know, My Pony. My Little Pony.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.360
My Little Pony. You've got...

01:14.360 --> 01:16.000
..Mr Squidgy, the hair in the middle.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.840
I mean, you know, they're dolls and ponies.

01:18.840 --> 01:21.560
It's something that children have.

01:21.560 --> 01:25.960
And yet, tomorrow, you're getting permanently sterilised.

01:25.960 --> 01:30.760
Yeah. I'm, like, a five-year-old child in an adult body.

01:30.760 --> 01:32.880
Um, yeah, I don't know.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.520
I guess, like, I had a really difficult childhood,

01:35.520 --> 01:39.360
and for most of it, I wasn't able to be a child.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.880
So I kind of, like, am, like,

01:40.880 --> 01:43.840
reliving my childhood, but, like, as an adult.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.280
Do you talk to your mum? No, no, no.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.720
My mum disowned me.

01:49.720 --> 01:51.640
So, no, I don't want to have a mother.

01:56.960 --> 02:00.880
The New Zealand Shooters Manifesto was titled The Great Replacement,

02:00.880 --> 02:03.200
a reference to the Great Replacement conspiracy theory

02:03.200 --> 02:05.680
that the far-right has believed in for quite a while now.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.000
The basic premise is that the unfettered immigration

02:08.000 --> 02:10.520
of non-white people into white-majority countries,

02:10.520 --> 02:13.200
alongside a socially engineered cultural shift

02:13.200 --> 02:15.120
towards white people not wanting children,

02:15.120 --> 02:18.800
will eventually lead to the replacement of the white populations with non-whites.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.320
Or so the theory goes.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.360
The theory itself is taking centre stage

02:22.360 --> 02:24.200
due to the aforementioned shootings right now,

02:24.800 --> 02:28.240
with the New York Times calling it a racist, sexist doctrine.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.800
I don't see how it could be sexist, but racist?

02:30.800 --> 02:32.240
I'd say that's probable.

02:32.240 --> 02:34.600
However, I don't think anybody actually expects

02:34.600 --> 02:38.960
a serious, unbiased analysis of the facts from the New York Times anymore.

02:38.960 --> 02:42.280
To the left-leaning media and the SJWs on their staff,

02:42.280 --> 02:44.160
The Great Replacement is racist,

02:44.160 --> 02:47.080
because it's a rightist take on race relations.

02:47.080 --> 02:49.520
The facts of the theory don't actually matter.

02:49.520 --> 02:52.240
And unfortunately, the right is the only group at the moment

02:52.240 --> 02:54.040
actually having the race discussion.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.080
The left simply calls you a racist,

02:56.080 --> 02:59.440
if you even entertain the idea of an open discussion on race.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.400
And while that might have worked a decade ago,

03:01.400 --> 03:05.280
everybody's becoming pretty numb to being baselessly called a racist nowadays.

03:05.280 --> 03:07.840
So, without a reasonable alternative from the left

03:07.840 --> 03:10.040
that doesn't boil down to slanderous lies,

03:10.040 --> 03:12.560
The Great Replacement theory continues to propagate.

03:12.560 --> 03:16.840
Natalism is a problem that affects everyone in the world.

03:16.840 --> 03:19.920
Anyone who has been born is a victim of childbirth.

03:19.920 --> 03:21.720
So, let's look at some facts.

03:21.720 --> 03:24.040
The UN commissioned a study on the topic.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.360
Replacement migration.

03:25.360 --> 03:28.280
Is it a solution to declining and aging populations?

03:28.280 --> 03:31.520
United Nations projections indicate that over the next 50 years,

03:31.520 --> 03:35.000
the populations of virtually all countries of Europe as well as Japan

03:35.000 --> 03:37.840
will face population decline and population aging.

03:37.840 --> 03:40.760
The new challenges of declining and aging populations

03:40.760 --> 03:45.000
will require comprehensive reassessments of many established policies and programs,

03:45.000 --> 03:47.480
including those relating to international migration.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.960
Now, this is actually the conversation that needs to happen.

03:49.960 --> 03:53.680
There's a practical concern regarding replacement fertility in Western nations right now.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.440
And immigration is one possible practical answer.

03:56.440 --> 04:00.440
In my opinion, it's not a very good answer if it comes at the expense of social cohesion.

04:00.440 --> 04:04.840
In the past, when various populations migrated to the United States or Canada or whatever,

04:04.840 --> 04:07.560
they did so in order to become Americans and Canadians.

04:07.560 --> 04:10.560
Yeah, Chinatowns and Little Italy's did and do exist.

04:10.560 --> 04:14.080
But in a couple of generations, most of those people integrated.

04:14.080 --> 04:17.880
Frankly, if we're not taking in people from culturally similar nations as our own,

04:17.880 --> 04:22.280
and the people that we do take in aren't willing to assimilate into our host culture over time,

04:22.280 --> 04:26.840
it's going to cause a lot of problems down the road, regardless of the race of the people involved.

04:26.840 --> 04:33.320
Race is ultimately a non-factor if people move to America to be Americans, not hyphen Americans.

04:33.320 --> 04:37.640
Of course, to even discuss this topic in any way other than being an open borders advocate

04:37.640 --> 04:39.880
makes you a racist in the eyes of the radical left.

04:39.880 --> 04:43.400
And so despite its flaws, the great replacement theory marches on.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.760
So when are you guys going to have babies?

04:45.760 --> 04:49.200
Um, I don't even think about that.

04:49.200 --> 04:49.680
Don't?

04:49.680 --> 04:53.120
No, no, you're like, dude, like, I don't want to have a kid right now.

04:53.120 --> 04:57.920
And she's like, I want to have babies or no, no, no, not at all.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.120
When are you guys going to have kids?

04:59.840 --> 05:00.160
Never.

05:02.320 --> 05:05.840
Alongside immigration, the other half of the theory is about the white birth rate.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.600
Without a sustainable birth rate,

05:07.600 --> 05:12.080
non-white immigration into white countries will effectively breed out the white race.

05:12.080 --> 05:15.200
At least this is what proponents of the great replacement theory believe.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.080
But disregarding the fact that even with the low fertility rate,

05:18.080 --> 05:22.000
there's more white people alive today than there ever has been in the history of the world,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.760
there's also the fact that a falling birth rate is not a uniquely white phenomenon.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.720
And I'm not just talking about Japan and South Korea and Taiwan,

05:28.720 --> 05:31.120
places that sport some of the lowest fertility rates on earth

05:31.120 --> 05:34.640
while simultaneously consisting of Asian, not white populations.

05:34.640 --> 05:39.040
But we're seeing the beginnings of a substantial birth rate decline in half of the world's nations.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.960
And that trend doesn't seem to be reversing.

05:40.960 --> 05:44.560
Now, for example, if you were a white nationalist and you took a look at this graph,

05:44.560 --> 05:46.400
it would be all doom and gloom, wouldn't it?

05:46.400 --> 05:48.640
Replacement fertility rate is 2.1.

05:48.640 --> 05:52.320
Your average woman needs to have 2.1 kids to keep the population growing.

05:52.320 --> 05:55.760
Below the 2.1 line are a bunch of European and Asian countries,

05:55.760 --> 05:58.720
and above it are a bunch of African and Middle Eastern countries.

05:58.720 --> 06:02.000
And if you were that white nationalist, you'd say the writing's on the wall

06:02.000 --> 06:04.560
and confidently close the study, secure in your thinking.

06:04.560 --> 06:08.720
But the very next graph shows fertility rates over a 50-year time span,

06:08.720 --> 06:10.080
and it paints a clear picture.

06:10.080 --> 06:14.400
Yeah, Kenya's fertility rate is 4, but in 1970 it was 8.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.480
Botswana's gone from 6 to 3.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.040
South Africa's gone from 5 to 2.5.

06:19.040 --> 06:22.720
Across all human populations, regardless of race or culture,

06:22.720 --> 06:26.480
fertility rates tend to decline as technology and education continues to advance.

06:26.480 --> 06:30.080
It's no secret that the third world is finally beginning to enter the modern era,

06:30.080 --> 06:32.960
nearly a century after we did, but it's now happening.

06:32.960 --> 06:37.920
So why wouldn't their birth rates also be dropping towards that dreaded 2.1 mark over time as well?

06:37.920 --> 06:40.320
White and Asian-majority countries got there first,

06:40.320 --> 06:44.000
because white and Asian-majority countries also became technologically advanced

06:44.000 --> 06:46.880
and educated first, but in at most 100 years,

06:46.880 --> 06:50.240
the third world will face the same fertility problems we're facing now.

06:50.240 --> 06:54.320
Sorry, alt-right, but I don't think your dreaded brown horde is coming.

06:54.320 --> 07:00.000
But I think it's a very bad idea to have kids, especially nowadays, in this modern era.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.440
Another component of the Great Replacement Theory is the push

07:03.440 --> 07:06.800
through media and culture to socialize white people to not have kids.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.840
And maybe, unlike everything else we've been discussing so far,

07:09.840 --> 07:12.080
there's actually something to this part of the theory.

07:12.160 --> 07:15.600
Why not fund the welfare state with a 100% inheritance tax?

07:15.600 --> 07:19.840
The idea that we should be able to pass on our life's accumulated wealth is deeply embedded.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.480
But imagine if we could use that money for the greater good,

07:22.480 --> 07:26.080
because having kids is no longer considered the greater good in our culture,

07:26.080 --> 07:28.720
for basically the first time in our very long history.

07:28.720 --> 07:32.000
How the biggest passion killer for men is trying for a baby.

07:32.000 --> 07:37.120
Attempting to start a family is worse than depression, tiredness, or even erectile dysfunction.

07:37.120 --> 07:40.720
Well, I could introduce you to many an internet fetishist that would disagree,

07:40.720 --> 07:42.160
but the argument is clear.

07:42.160 --> 07:45.120
Sex is no fun if you have to take care of a baby afterwards.

07:45.120 --> 07:48.240
And sex being no fun is the more important thing to consider.

07:48.240 --> 07:52.880
Having children lowers women's lifetime earnings, an outcome known as the child penalty.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.760
Don't have kids. You'll lose your money and career.

07:55.760 --> 07:58.320
Be a strong independent woman who don't need no man.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.560
Until you're 40 and you hate your life, anyway.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.920
Americans value equality more at work than equality at home.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.120
Hey women, hear that?

08:05.120 --> 08:07.520
You're only considered equal if you're not a stay-at-home mom.

08:07.520 --> 08:11.600
If you value equality, you'll forget all about that pesky family thing you've been wanting.

08:11.600 --> 08:14.640
Is it unethical for people to pass their wealth on to their children?

08:14.640 --> 08:17.840
Give it all to the state. Your family is subordinate to the nation.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.440
Your property rights don't matter.

08:19.440 --> 08:22.160
Just don't do it. Why you shouldn't have kids.

08:22.160 --> 08:25.520
So your friends are accidentally, on purpose, having children,

08:25.520 --> 08:29.760
giving each other rings, and doing beautiful, real, rewarding things.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.200
This is why you're not.

08:31.200 --> 08:34.480
This article is particularly special. Of course, it's from Vice.

08:34.560 --> 08:38.960
Maybe you're like me, in your late 20s and starting to feel like you're in the autumn of your life.

08:38.960 --> 08:42.000
Okay, maybe not autumn, but summer is definitely getting colder.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.720
The drug-taking and regular, baggage-free sex is slowing down.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.800
But we're also not dead, so that's nice.

08:48.800 --> 08:51.440
Friends are starting to accidentally, on purpose, have children,

08:51.440 --> 08:54.720
give each other rings, and do beautiful, real, rewarding things together.

08:54.720 --> 08:55.920
And there you are.

08:55.920 --> 08:59.440
In bed on a Saturday at 4pm in yesterday's underwear.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.400
Watching Netflix.

09:00.400 --> 09:03.280
Texting your housemate to open the door for your menu log guy,

09:03.280 --> 09:05.120
because you can't bring yourself to go out there.

09:05.120 --> 09:08.400
I ward off those confused, jealous, self-pitying pangs

09:08.400 --> 09:10.720
when a friend reaches a milestone that's light years ahead of me,

09:10.720 --> 09:12.720
by reminding myself milestones are forever.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.320
This goes especially for kids.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.960
You can't divorce kids for a dude you met in Belize.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.720
To be clear, my friend's children are beautiful,

09:18.720 --> 09:21.920
and when they fall asleep in my arms I feel like the chaotic nature of existence

09:21.920 --> 09:23.360
makes a tiny bit of sense.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.440
But there's a lot of fuckness ahead for parents.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.200
How do you know your kid won't be an asshole?

09:27.200 --> 09:30.000
And what if they get pregnant at 15 and you're a grandparent at 40?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.200
I find keeping that stuff in the forefront of your mind gets me through.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.600
This person's life sounds so empty.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.400
By my late 20s, I was getting pretty fucking tired

09:38.400 --> 09:40.720
of the nonsense I had got up to in my early 20s.

09:40.720 --> 09:43.040
And this person also sounds like they're tired of it too,

09:43.040 --> 09:46.800
but since they can't find anybody who can actually stand them for longer than one night,

09:46.800 --> 09:49.840
they're deep in denial about how the party ended a few years ago.

09:49.840 --> 09:53.200
There's very good reasons to not have kids, don't get me wrong,

09:53.200 --> 09:55.040
but none of them are presented here.

09:55.040 --> 09:59.120
The only thing here is rationalization is designed to cover up loneliness.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.400
Here's another vice a-

10:00.400 --> 10:01.360
AHHH!

10:01.360 --> 10:04.800
Jesus, I didn't expect that to be staring me in the face when I clicked the link.

10:04.800 --> 10:08.960
The people choosing to be sterilized in their 20s, inside the child-free movement.

10:08.960 --> 10:12.880
I'm actually a proponent of child freedom on the grounds of individual human rights and autonomy,

10:12.880 --> 10:15.200
but you also probably shouldn't be getting sterilized

10:15.200 --> 10:17.280
until a lot of other pieces in your life are set.

10:17.280 --> 10:20.400
Sterilization is something that should probably happen when you have a committed partner

10:20.400 --> 10:24.720
and you've both seriously decided that you're not having any more, or any at all.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.160
But listen to this clown.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.760
I honestly don't like kids.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.160
They're germy and annoying and gross.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.680
The 19 year old explains.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.840
Hey, uh, Caitlin from Philadelphia?

10:33.840 --> 10:35.280
You're still a kid yourself.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.840
Puberty doesn't even end until 25.

10:37.840 --> 10:42.080
I know that some people know they don't want kids from a young age, and that's fine,

10:42.080 --> 10:45.680
but it's also exceedingly rare for them to keep that attitude as they mature.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.600
Motherhood is bad for a woman's health.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.600
Alright, I'm sure it is on some level.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.000
But here's something off to the side that I've noticed.

10:52.080 --> 10:56.240
There's a lot of stock photos of race-mixed families in a whole ton of articles.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.520
That's fine, of course.

10:57.520 --> 11:01.120
But why is it that on the articles that paint parenthood in a negative light,

11:01.120 --> 11:03.440
it's almost always entirely white families?

11:04.320 --> 11:05.040
Huh.

11:05.040 --> 11:05.760
Makes you think.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.000
Parents, the children will be fine.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.280
Spend their inheritance.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.120
Don't leave anything to your kids.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.000
Give it to charity.

11:12.000 --> 11:12.880
Give it to the state.

11:12.880 --> 11:13.760
Spend it frivolously.

11:13.760 --> 11:14.560
Who cares?

11:14.560 --> 11:16.400
Just make sure you neglect your family.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.840
It's a moral imperative.

11:17.840 --> 11:21.600
Millennials are buying homes because of their dogs, not their children or marriages.

11:21.600 --> 11:24.320
Is this another example of millennials ruining everything?

11:24.320 --> 11:26.880
It should be illegal to be a stay-at-home mom.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.720
You know, we've come full circle.

11:28.720 --> 11:32.080
At one point in history, the state forced women to stay in the house,

11:32.080 --> 11:34.960
using violence when necessary to keep them compliant.

11:34.960 --> 11:38.160
And after years of struggle, women have finally won the right

11:38.160 --> 11:41.040
to have the state use violence on them to get them to leave the house.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.400
Feminism.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.880
And we haven't even gotten to the cheating part of it.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.080
Oh, the cheating.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.440
Why men should give their wives a cheat pass this Christmas.

11:49.440 --> 11:52.160
My wife wants to have a baby, but says it won't be mine.

11:52.160 --> 11:56.080
When a boyfriend joins the marriage, they agreed she could have sex on the side

11:56.080 --> 11:58.080
as long as he didn't have to know about it.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.520
Then she fell in love.

11:59.520 --> 12:00.720
Modern love.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.280
I kiss one good night, but not the other.

12:03.280 --> 12:06.480
One is my boyfriend of 10 years, the other is my husband.

12:06.480 --> 12:10.160
I secretly date people who aren't my boyfriend, but I don't think it's cheating.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.080
All right, allow me to set the stage.

12:12.080 --> 12:16.560
Let's say you're a shitty female journo, living in your hyper-left urban bubble.

12:16.560 --> 12:20.400
Empowered by the feminarchy, you enjoy sexual encounters behind the back

12:20.400 --> 12:22.560
of your soy boy beta male boyfriend.

12:22.560 --> 12:26.400
And despite your best efforts, you're both close to being discovered

12:26.400 --> 12:30.880
and there's some deep, dark, problematic part of you that feels guilty about what you've done.

12:30.880 --> 12:36.240
Do you A. Come clean like an adult, face the consequence of a messy breakup,

12:36.240 --> 12:41.040
but use the opportunity to polish yourself up and work towards a healthier way of living?

12:41.040 --> 12:46.720
Or B. Write articles normalizing infidelity in the hopes that society will take your side

12:46.720 --> 12:49.120
in being an absolutely shit human being.

12:49.120 --> 12:54.400
And we've got everybody's favorite drool sock, Ocasio-Cortez, asking the tough questions.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.000
Is it okay to still have children?

12:56.720 --> 12:58.480
Well, maybe not for you.

12:58.480 --> 13:03.120
Ocasio-Cortez, the private citizen, is free to have as many shitty takes as she likes.

13:03.120 --> 13:07.040
Ocasio-Cortez, the elected official, has no business asking whether or not

13:07.040 --> 13:09.360
it's appropriate for the population to be reproducing.

13:09.360 --> 13:11.200
That is not the domain of the government.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.280
And yet things are now trending that way.

13:13.280 --> 13:16.000
Gay and trans lessons for primary school students.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.080
In my opinion, it's probably a bit young to be learning about anything sexual at the age of five,

13:20.080 --> 13:22.960
gay or straight, but you'd be a bigot if you objected.

13:22.960 --> 13:26.720
Just like how this dad was a bigot because he objected to his kids having to write

13:26.720 --> 13:29.520
about their conversion to Islam as a school assignment.

13:29.520 --> 13:33.440
If there's one part of the great replacement theory that actually holds water,

13:33.440 --> 13:35.920
it's the push to normalize not having kids.

13:35.920 --> 13:41.120
They began by attacking masculinity and fatherhood like it's inherently flawed and always toxic.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.120
And now they're coming for motherhood and femininity,

13:43.120 --> 13:46.720
like it's a social, financial, and as existential burden on women's equality.

13:46.720 --> 13:50.400
It's a genderless blob agenda where men are like women and women are like men.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.840
Where children are encouraged to be gay or trans at the drop of a hat.

13:53.840 --> 13:57.600
And if you object, the government takes them away because they aren't your kids,

13:57.600 --> 13:58.720
they're the state's kids.

13:58.720 --> 14:01.280
Where wanting to be a stay-at-home mom is problematic,

14:01.280 --> 14:03.920
or wanting to be a strong father figure is oppressive.

14:03.920 --> 14:08.080
Where the complimentary support that men and women bring to each other is actively campaigned

14:08.080 --> 14:11.600
against for a few fleeting moments of freedom from responsibility,

14:11.600 --> 14:13.920
followed by a rapid descent into chaos.

14:13.920 --> 14:18.080
I'm not saying that men wanting to be like women, women wanting to be like men,

14:18.080 --> 14:22.240
people wanting to be gay or trans, whatever, I'm not saying that's bad.

14:22.240 --> 14:26.000
If that's your natural proclivity, all the power to you, go off and enjoy your life.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.560
But there's certainly a cultural push right now to put that on people who may simply be confused,

14:30.640 --> 14:33.920
or on the fence, or having other unrelated problems.

14:33.920 --> 14:36.560
And if it ends up not being what they want out of their life,

14:36.560 --> 14:38.960
their experimentation is often to their detriment,

14:38.960 --> 14:42.400
and then that detriment itself is considered oppressive.

14:42.400 --> 14:45.840
Nothing has damaged both modern society and the individual

14:45.840 --> 14:48.080
more than the destruction of the nuclear family.

14:48.080 --> 14:51.760
Radical feminists talk about smashing the nuclear family all the time,

14:51.760 --> 14:53.920
and they do so at their own peril.

14:53.920 --> 14:57.200
Reasons like these, many more,

14:57.760 --> 15:01.360
and the fact that I don't like to leave things of this magnitude to chance,

15:02.800 --> 15:06.480
all informed my decision to become surgically sterilized.

15:07.040 --> 15:10.800
However, even as this part of the great replacement theory holds water,

15:10.800 --> 15:14.160
it doesn't do so for the reasons the alt-right thinks it does.

15:14.160 --> 15:18.000
It's not part of some grand Jewish plot to breed out the white race

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
in order to seize direct political power.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.400
Of course, I know there are some within the Democratic Party

15:22.400 --> 15:25.440
that have directly stated this to be their goal, surprisingly enough.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.360
It's no secret that demographic change,

15:27.360 --> 15:29.680
rather than any serious attempt to change policy,

15:29.680 --> 15:32.160
is why California went from Republican to Democrat,

15:32.160 --> 15:34.560
and verifieds on Twitter are thinly veiled

15:34.560 --> 15:37.200
in their endorsement of that tactic in other locations.

15:37.200 --> 15:41.520
In Why the Announcement of a Looming White Minority Makes Demographers Nervous,

15:41.520 --> 15:45.280
Dr. Myers watched as progressives, envisioning political power,

15:45.280 --> 15:48.240
became enamored with the idea of a coming white minority.

15:48.240 --> 15:51.680
He said it was hard to interest them in his work on ways to make the change

15:51.680 --> 15:54.480
seem less threatening to the fearful white Americans.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.360
For instance, by emphasizing the good that can come from immigration.

15:57.360 --> 15:58.400
It was conquest.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.480
Our day has come, he said of their reaction.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.640
They wanted to overpower them with numbers.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.400
It was demographic destiny.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.520
And you know what?

16:05.520 --> 16:06.160
I get it.

16:06.160 --> 16:09.840
A white nationalist reading that article would screech that he was right all along,

16:09.840 --> 16:13.200
and grabbing a tiki torch, loudly exclaim he would not be replaced.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.960
But big picture here.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.120
Do you actually think the Democratic Party,

16:17.120 --> 16:18.880
even if they were willing to do so,

16:18.880 --> 16:21.200
is competent enough to manage a secret scheme

16:21.200 --> 16:23.280
to replace all white people with immigrants?

16:23.280 --> 16:24.000
No.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.160
They're not even competent enough to win elections while having decisive advantages.

16:28.160 --> 16:31.280
There's a simpler solution to everything the Great Replacement talks about.

16:31.280 --> 16:35.200
In terms of the overwhelming media and culture push normalizing not having kids,

16:35.200 --> 16:38.480
through cheating, through transitioning, through just not having them,

16:38.480 --> 16:41.760
it's less likely to be a Jewish conspiracy to lower the white birth rate,

16:41.760 --> 16:45.520
and more likely to be yet another social justice push at equalization.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.600
If all modes of living are morally valid,

16:47.600 --> 16:50.560
then they all need to be represented equally across the population.

16:50.560 --> 16:52.960
Of course, that's wrong for other reasons,

16:52.960 --> 16:55.760
but with the fringe exception of the don't perpetuate whiteness,

16:55.760 --> 16:59.120
stop having white babies crowd, it's not about white fertility.

16:59.120 --> 17:02.160
We've already seen that technology and education have a far greater impact

17:02.160 --> 17:03.280
on everybody's fertility,

17:03.280 --> 17:06.800
and that a massive population crash across all races is on the way.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.240
And as for the media push,

17:08.240 --> 17:11.520
it really just seems to be a bunch of lonely, guilty individuals

17:11.520 --> 17:14.000
trying to justify their loneliness and their guilt.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.440
In terms of immigration,

17:15.440 --> 17:20.240
while there might be racist lunatics in the SJW wings of some political parties,

17:20.240 --> 17:22.320
masturbating to the idea of a white genocide,

17:22.320 --> 17:25.520
they lack both the power and the competence to actually pull it off.

17:25.520 --> 17:28.880
It's far more likely that unfettered immigration is a corporatist push

17:28.880 --> 17:30.560
to lower the cost of unskilled labour

17:30.560 --> 17:32.880
by flooding the marketplace with able-bodied workers,

17:32.880 --> 17:37.280
and the social, cultural, racial, and religious consequences of that action

17:37.280 --> 17:38.800
simply don't matter to them.

17:38.800 --> 17:42.640
But some people see all of this and take the shortcut to white replacement.

17:42.640 --> 17:47.440
Why is the CBC telling Canadians to have fewer children to reduce our carbon footprint,

17:47.440 --> 17:50.000
while at the same time advocating for increased immigration

17:50.000 --> 17:51.520
to make up for declining birth rates?

17:51.520 --> 17:54.640
If having fewer people in Canada is good for the environment,

17:54.640 --> 17:57.120
why bring in one million new people per year?

17:57.120 --> 17:58.240
That's a fair question.

17:58.880 --> 18:01.600
The answer is probably something like the common question of

18:01.600 --> 18:05.120
why have your own kids when there's orphaned ones out there who need to be adopted?

18:05.120 --> 18:07.840
There's a clear difference between people who don't yet exist

18:07.840 --> 18:09.920
and people who do but live somewhere else.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.400
This doesn't make me an advocate for the migration of

18:12.400 --> 18:15.520
one million workers a year into Canada from Islamic countries,

18:15.520 --> 18:17.680
but this person is asking the wrong question.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.200
Approaching the problem from this angle

18:19.200 --> 18:21.760
makes you incapable of offering any real solutions.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.360
In the end, regardless of any other factor,

18:23.360 --> 18:26.480
there will always be a percentage of the population that will never have kids,

18:26.480 --> 18:29.120
no matter how easy their society makes it to have them.

18:29.120 --> 18:32.800
And conversely, there will always be a percentage of the population that will always have kids,

18:32.800 --> 18:35.120
no matter how hard their society makes it to have them.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.800
And both of these things are fine.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.280
People are free to do what they like with their lives,

18:39.280 --> 18:42.400
even if they choose to lead lives completely devoid of meaning.

18:42.400 --> 18:45.440
I'm not saying that having kids is the only path to a meaningful life.

18:45.440 --> 18:46.720
There's obviously others.

18:46.800 --> 18:50.320
But having kids is very clearly one common path

18:50.320 --> 18:52.400
that applies to almost all people on the planet.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.960
And this is coming from somebody who doesn't want kids himself.

18:54.960 --> 18:58.320
But if the complaint is that white people aren't having kids anymore,

18:58.320 --> 19:01.600
we don't need to look at absurd claims like Jewish conspiracies

19:01.600 --> 19:03.680
or waves of hostile immigrants or whatever,

19:03.680 --> 19:06.400
framing the conversation in this way as a non-starter.

19:06.400 --> 19:09.600
Liberalism holds that the individual is more important than the group,

19:09.600 --> 19:13.600
that individual human rights constitute a functioning society's first priority,

19:13.600 --> 19:17.840
and that, seemingly paradoxically, through exclusive protection of the individual,

19:17.840 --> 19:19.840
the group also ends up being protected.

19:19.840 --> 19:23.760
Enshrining the supremacy of the individual allows the group to flourish.

19:23.760 --> 19:27.440
Other competing political philosophies that begin with group rights

19:27.440 --> 19:29.760
sacrifice individuals in the name of the group,

19:29.760 --> 19:33.360
and ultimately cause the failure of the group in the long term anyway.

19:33.360 --> 19:38.560
If, in a free society, the goals of the individual and the goals of the group are not in alignment.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.880
And I do think the alignment of the two forces,

19:40.960 --> 19:45.120
rather than one being subservient to the other, is the proper way to conceptualize this,

19:45.120 --> 19:47.520
then individuals will be less likely to want kids.

19:47.520 --> 19:52.000
Swinging too far to the individualistic side of things leads to an over-reliance on rights,

19:52.000 --> 19:53.520
as important as rights are,

19:53.520 --> 19:57.120
cultivating a type of narcissism where people are unwilling to give up their position

19:57.120 --> 19:59.600
as the center of their own lives to a hypothetical child.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.640
On the other hand, swinging too far to the collectivist side of things

20:02.640 --> 20:04.320
leads to an authoritarian state,

20:04.320 --> 20:07.360
where the structure of the nation is willing to consume its own populace

20:07.360 --> 20:09.040
in order to maintain its bureaucracy.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.680
And we've seen that, under exceptionally harsh conditions,

20:11.680 --> 20:14.400
human fertility falls as people wait to have kids,

20:14.400 --> 20:15.920
hoping the future will be better.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.560
Unless the state forces all women to be constantly pregnant,

20:18.560 --> 20:20.400
the way that Romania did, for example,

20:20.400 --> 20:22.560
which leads to its own particular horror show.

20:22.560 --> 20:26.000
But when the interests of the individual and the interests of the group align,

20:26.000 --> 20:27.760
not only does the birth rate improve,

20:27.760 --> 20:32.720
but so does investment, education, entrepreneurship, technological advancement,

20:32.720 --> 20:36.160
basically most of the domains required in order to have a fulfilled life.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.640
The alt-right may be a great lover of fascism,

20:38.640 --> 20:41.840
but ironically enough, their goal of an improved birth rate

20:41.840 --> 20:45.120
would be fulfilled not through the heavy hand of a tyrannical regime,

20:45.120 --> 20:49.840
but by a non-interfering, Night Watchmen-styled, democratically elected government.

20:49.840 --> 20:52.400
The theory of the Great Replacement is a joke.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.880
It identifies problems, though not accurately.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.760
It fails to identify the correct causes for those problems,

20:57.760 --> 21:02.480
and it offers solutions to those problems that are not only wildly incorrect and dysfunctional,

21:02.480 --> 21:07.120
but that also lead to bloodbaths, as history has unfortunately shown us.

21:07.120 --> 21:11.520
For as much as both Nazis and Communists hate liberals,

21:11.520 --> 21:15.600
liberalism is the only political ideology compatible with human life.
