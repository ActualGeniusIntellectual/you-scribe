1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
I've been thinking about the phrase, the perfect is the enemy of the good.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,640
The basic idea behind the saying is that while the perfect may be perfect, it's also unchanging

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,920
and stagnant.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,340
While the good is good enough, you're not perfect but you're improving every day,

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,740
and therefore you're getting better.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,060
This idea makes sense if you understand that human beings can't actually ever obtain

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,060
the perfect.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,380
This idea has been expressed many times in many different ways, unrelated to Voltaire's

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,980
own formulation of it.

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,080
Several Greek philosophers talked about the golden mean, which is the idea that any virtuous

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,020
quality taken to excess is no longer virtuous, and that moderation is what gives a thing

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,020
its virtue.

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,540
A commonly cited example is the virtue of courage.

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,400
A deficiency of courage is cowardice, but an excess of courage is recklessness.

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,540
In computer programming there's a similar saying, premature optimization is the root

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,780
of all evil.

17
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,140
Consider the possibility that it will take you three hours to program a task into a computer.

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,840
However, it will take you six hours to program a tool that will automate that task repeatedly.

19
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,780
If the task had to be done 10,000 times, it makes complete sense to spend the extra time

20
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,500
making the tool and then simply have it run while you do something else.

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,020
However, if you only have to run the task once, you might as well just manually program

22
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,220
it for three hours rather than making an automated tool for six.

23
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,960
There's a similar problem in space flight.

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,700
If human beings wanted to reach another star system, would we launch a ship right now with

25
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,980
our current technology, going as fast as we can make it, with a bunch of frozen embryos

26
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,140
and a computer system designed to manage a colony and basically grow those embryos into

27
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,140
humans?

28
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,980
Or do we wait 100 years when maybe the ships are faster and the computers would be much

29
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,980
more sophisticated?

30
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,460
Sure, we could begin the task right now, but it would seem like adding that 100 years of

31
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,420
prep time would, in the long run, save us a lot more than 100 years of work in actually

32
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,660
completing the task.

33
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,980
Or consider you're playing a video game and you have to fight a really hard boss.

34
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,420
Maybe you can run in and destroy the boss right now.

35
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,280
You need to go and grind levels or collect materials or something.

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,180
And maybe at some point you over-prepare so that extra time is kind of wasted, at least

37
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,980
in terms of that specific boss fight.

38
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,380
The point is, you can definitely draw a parabolic arc between the amount of investment made

39
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,380
and a payoff.

40
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,740
On the one hand, you have the complete and total failure of the Enterprise because you

41
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,820
failed to prepare.

42
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,380
On the other end, you have so much time wasted in preparation that it doesn't matter that

43
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,520
you actually won.

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,580
You have a victory, but it's become inefficient.

45
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,660
This is also, by the way, the same argument that you can make for lowering taxes actually

46
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,400
increasing tax revenue.

47
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,020
For example, if something is taxed at 100%, well in that case, maybe a large chunk of

48
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,860
the population can't afford to buy that thing regularly, and so sales of it go down,

49
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,140
and so tax revenue goes down.

50
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,660
But let's say you tax it at 20%, suddenly, sales are up.

51
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,180
And as long as sales go up by more than 5 times, which is a definite possibility, then

52
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,180
the government actually collects more tax.

53
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,820
Because even though they're only getting 20% as opposed to 100, that's 80% less tax

54
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,940
the consumer has to pay, which means that they can afford to buy more.

55
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,880
So on that same arc, there's definitely two extremes.

56
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,820
On the one hand, there's no taxes and the government ceases to function.

57
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,060
On the other hand, things are taxed too much and economic activity slows down because people

58
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,060
just can't afford it.

59
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,380
And in the middle, there's that sweet spot where taxes are low enough that people are

60
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,420
buying a lot, and yet they're still high enough that all of those individual purchases

61
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,260
that wouldn't have existed if they were too high are generating even more taxes for

62
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,260
the government.

63
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,500
This is also known as the Pareto Principle.

64
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,540
Alfredo Pareto was an Italian economist, and one of his hobbies was growing beans.

65
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,380
He realized that no matter how many beans he planted, it was 20% of them that actually

66
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,780
produced usable crop, and the other 80% produced either no crop or only enough crop to replant

67
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,980
and not enough to eat.

68
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:38,020
And then of that top 20%, another 20% produced an even more disproportionate amount of harvestable

69
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,020
beans.

70
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,180
And this doesn't just apply to crops.

71
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,260
It applies to the population of cities as compared to the countryside.

72
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,060
It applies to the distribution of matter in our solar system.

73
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,780
It applies to income inequality.

74
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,980
It's also mapped out by the Fibonacci sequence, which is basically a series of numbers where

75
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,660
each entry is the sum of the previous two entries.

76
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,320
Mapping this out into a spiral pattern creates that weird overlay you often see on top of

77
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,820
artwork and photos, meant to describe something aesthetically pleasing.

78
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,180
It's also what you see when you cut a banana in half.

79
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,880
It's also the pattern in which your hair naturally grows.

80
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,780
If you shave your head and look at the crown, you'll see it spiraling outward.

81
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,020
It also describes the movement of flowers as they grow and twist.

82
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:21,540
In short, this idea, this natural inequality, seems to be baked into nature in everything.

83
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,780
In biology?

84
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,780
In physics?

85
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,780
In sociology?

86
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,780
It's something that, on some fundamental level, we can't escape, and it does cause

87
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,780
us serious problems.

88
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,220
If a society becomes too unequal, then for all those masses of people who are stuck with

89
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,840
literally nothing, they have nothing to lose.

90
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,400
And to them, destroying everything might be a better shot at getting ahead than working

91
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
hard.

92
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,140
And that is something that we do have to avoid.

93
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:51,760
So yes, all of these various principles and ideas, they do describe the 99% and 1% divide.

94
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:59,660
They also describe the idea that 1% of the 1% hold 99% of the 1% wealth, as well as 1%

95
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:05,560
of the 1% of the 1%, holding 99% of the 1% of the 1% wealth.

96
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,360
It's not just that the 1% are this monolithic class of hyper-rich people, it in fact keeps

97
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,360
going upward.

98
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,040
However, what this view of economics fundamentally lacks is time.

99
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,420
For example, half of all American citizens, roughly half I think, have a very high chance

100
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,880
of entering the top 10% for at least part of their life.

101
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,800
40% of all middle class people in the United States will be in the 1%, at least for one

102
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
year.

103
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,680
The 1% is not this unchanging class of bankers and fat cats, it constantly churns, people

104
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,440
drop in and out of it all the time.

105
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,760
And when you add time to the equation, you realize that not only does the Pareto Principle,

106
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,040
or the Fibonacci Sequence, or anything else that describes the fundamental inequality

107
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,520
baked into existence, not only do those things describe classes, they also describe you at

108
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,160
different stages of your life.

109
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,680
There will likely be times where you have nothing, and then there will likely be times

110
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,280
where you are wildly successful in at least one thing.

111
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,560
But how does all this relate to the idea of the perfect being the enemy of the good?

112
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,120
Well within the Fibonacci Sequence, the perfect is infinite, and as we all know, no mathematic

113
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,020
sequence ever reaches infinity.

114
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,100
At the end of the day, achieving absolute perfection is impossible, and therefore at

115
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,320
some point, increasing effort results in diminishing returns, and continued activity becomes more

116
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,560
and more inefficient.

117
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,880
This is described by another old proverb, the journey is more important than the destination.

118
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,600
If the destination is perfection, and the journey is being good, then it doesn't actually

119
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,720
matter that you will never reach perfection, because as you continue on the journey, you

120
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,800
will get better at whatever it is you're doing.

121
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,160
This even applies to me, it's better for me to do one video a day, even if some of

122
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,060
the videos are kind of bad, because I get better at my craft by doing them.

123
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,400
If I spend months and months and months working on the perfect video, it's never going to

124
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,760
be perfect, and those months were spent with no content.

125
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,320
Sometimes yes, you do have to set aside time and make a big project, that happens, but

126
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,320
rather than focus on making something truly superb, it's better to constantly try and

127
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,200
fail and improve, because that leads to mastery.

128
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,240
In the realm of politics, this is the utopian's fatal flaw.

129
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,540
Anyone who believes that they can create the perfect world, whether they're religious

130
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,180
and looking to heaven, whether they're communists or socialists, and looking to build the perfectly

131
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,240
equal world where no one suffers, whether they're fascists or Nazis, and they want

132
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,660
the perfectly ordered state, they're all committing what is called the Nirvana Fallacy.

133
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,120
They create a false dichotomy that presents one option that is clearly more advantageous

134
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,120
than the other option.

135
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,320
However, the problem is that the more advantageous option is technically impossible.

136
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,460
This is what you get, for example, when a communist says that their theoretical idea

137
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,260
of what communism is, or should be, is better than the capitalism that we have on the ground

138
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,980
today in the real world.

139
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,840
Well sure, anything that you theorize is certainly going to be better than reality, but that

140
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,540
doesn't mean that the theory works.

141
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:55,080
It's fundamentally a choice between one realistic achievable possibility and one unrealistic

142
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,680
unachievable possibility that could in some way be better.

143
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,140
The ideal is always going to look better than the situation you find yourself in, but that

144
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,940
doesn't mean that the ideal is realistic or achievable.

145
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,940
Again to go back to computer programming, they have another phrase, worse is better,

146
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,400
where basically the idea is, it doesn't matter if your software is technically better

147
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,300
than other software, if it's not easy to use, it's not going to catch on.

148
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,060
Sometimes things are better because they have less functions and therefore they're

149
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,060
more streamlined.

150
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,760
But what happens when some kind of extremist, whether they're a communist or a fascist

151
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,980
or a religious zealot, or any other kind of extremist that could exist, what happens when

152
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,080
they get caught up in this, when they abandon the good for the perfect?

153
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,460
They ignore the tangibly good humble things they could do around them to make things a

154
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:40,480
little bit better, and instead aim directly for the top, the perfect, the ideal.

155
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,140
Well firstly, things have to be purified, that's the source of the purity spiral.

156
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,740
Anyone and anything that is not in a line with perfection itself must be disposed of.

157
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,180
Thankfully online that's just deplatforming and de-personing, but in real life it's consistently

158
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,560
led to mass killings.

159
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,580
Once they've created this hypothetical pure space that will never actually exist, they

160
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,300
then expand the space outward to encompass all of reality, so that not only does the

161
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,100
utopia exist, but nothing other than the utopia exists.

162
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,020
This is why, for example, in the political doctrine of fascism, Mussolini writes that

163
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,940
everything must be within the state, nothing must be outside the state, and nothing must

164
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,940
be against the state.

165
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,300
It's also why the communists claim that communism will never work and will never be

166
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,740
true or real unless the entire world is communist.

167
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,340
But perfection itself is also stagnant and unchanging, therefore it must always have

168
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,260
been, and it must always continue to be.

169
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,860
So any of these people, rather than admitting that they changed, they erase history.

170
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,340
This is why you see a lot of people, for example, disavowing their old edgy pasts, whether it's

171
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,340
Eddie Murphy saying that it was a different time when he made those gay jokes, or any

172
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,900
of those people that I mentioned in my Who I Miss video, people that I used to know,

173
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:55,240
or at least used to look up to, content creators, animators, artists, YouTubers, who ten years

174
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,180
ago would make edgy jokes and now do nothing but virtue signal on Twitter.

175
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:05,260
It's why you get both ISIS and other Islamic groups, destroying both secular artwork and

176
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,540
the religious figures from other faiths, because only those things that are Islamic must be

177
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,660
allowed to exist.

178
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,740
It's why you get the radical left wanting to destroy statues of confederate generals,

179
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,620
or change the names of universities or other institutions.

180
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,880
David King, in his book The Commissar Vanishes, talked about how the Soviets did this as well.

181
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,440
Photos of Stalin and those around him were routinely doctored after the fact to remove

182
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,940
people who had fallen from power, as if they never existed at all.

183
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,960
And of course, with the Nazis, we know where this ultimately led.

184
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,880
The ethnic cleansing of the Jewish population was actually considered to be a cleansing.

185
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,100
It was, in their eyes, making Germany clean.

186
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,800
And the line of logic, should the Nazis had been allowed to exist for longer than say

187
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:52,320
12 years, would have gone from Jews can't exist in Germany, to Jews don't exist in Germany,

188
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,480
to Jews never existed at all.

189
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,040
And of course, I would be remiss in not bringing this up.

190
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,640
It's also how you get that crazy We Was Kangs logic, where you get those absolute brainlets

191
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,960
out there who think that the Vikings and the Celts were black for some reason.

192
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,220
If you're siding with the perfect over the good, then regardless of your political persuasion,

193
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,280
you will inevitably find yourself trying to rewrite the past.

194
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,680
The past is problematic and it must be erased, which is what makes it all the more scary

195
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,760
when you hear, for example, Britain's Supreme Court claim that Parliament was not prorogued.

196
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:30,440
The decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament was unlawful because it had the

197
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:37,080
effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional

198
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,000
functions without reasonable justification.

199
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,640
This court has already concluded that the Prime Minister's advice to Her Majesty was

200
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,680
unlawful, void and of no effect.

201
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,720
This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect

202
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,200
and should be quashed.

203
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,520
This means that when the Royal Commissioners walked into the House of Lords, it was as

204
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,680
if they had walked in with a blank sheet of paper.

205
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,660
The prorogation was also void and of no effect.

206
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,100
Parliament has not been prorogued.

207
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,240
It is one thing for the Supreme Court to disagree with the prorogation of Parliament, for them

208
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,980
to use whatever powers they have to re-open Parliament and to end it being prorogued.

209
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,340
It's another thing entirely for them to say it was never prorogued in the first place.

210
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:34,660
Or, on the other side of the pond, consider Nancy Pelosi saying that Trump was not acquitted,

211
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,420
even though he obviously was.

212
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,700
Besides here, but he was acquitted, his poll ratings are high.

213
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,700
There was no equipment.

214
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,700
By the Senate.

215
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,580
You can't have an acquittal unless you have a trial, and you can't have a trial and have

216
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:49,420
witnesses and documents, so he can say he's acquitted and the headlines can say acquitted,

217
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,260
but he's impeached forever, branded with that and not vindicated.

218
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,900
Yes, Trump was impeached, and yes, he was acquitted, but the past must be rewritten.

219
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,560
Reality itself must be denied.

220
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,560
That was, in fact, the core of the issue in the UK and the US.

221
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,920
A second referendum was desired on Brexit so that it could overwrite the first and pretend

222
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,140
like it never happened.

223
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,400
Trump's impeachment went forward rather than simply trying to oust him in 2020 using the

224
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,800
democratic process, because his presidency, his candidacy, his victory must be erased.

225
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,960
In both of these situations, rather than the left dealing with reality as it is and devising

226
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,680
a better plan for them to move forward, which would be, by the way, pursuing the good, instead

227
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,520
they have to cancel out everything that's happened, which is, fundamentally, pursuing

228
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
the perfect.

229
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,120
The perfect is the enemy of the good, because the perfect is the domain only of the ideologue.

230
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,580
The grounded, rational person will still have an ideal, but will understand that he will

231
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,580
never reach it.

232
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,620
That's not an excuse not to try to reach it, though, because in the trying you become better

233
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,020
and better over time.

234
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,780
Yes, on some level you have to accept that the world has fundamental inequality in it,

235
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,260
and that it's not going away no matter how hard you try.

236
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,940
However, that doesn't mean that everything's lost, because the timeline of your life also

237
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,740
has fundamental inequality in it.

238
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,380
A 40-year-old certainly is not the same person, nor is he in the same place, as he was when

239
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,880
he was 30, or 20, or 10.

240
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,060
The good allows for incremental improvements over time, but the perfect is perfect, and

241
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,020
you are not perfect, nor will you ever be.

242
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,700
So if you're smart, you won't be a perfectionist.

243
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,600
You'll pursue incremental improvement over the ideal.

244
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,560
You'll value being better for the benefits it brings you.

245
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,020
Benefits that perfection can't provide, because perfection assumes you already have them.

246
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,860
And if you don't have them, well then you're not perfect, and you need to be purged.

247
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,620
Anyway, that's my thoughts for today.

248
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,580
Don't aim to be the best person you could possibly be.

249
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,220
Just aim to be better than you were yesterday.

250
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,220
You'll get there eventually.

251
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,220
Thanks for listening, my friends.

252
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,220
I love you.
