0	3760	I've been thinking about the phrase, the perfect is the enemy of the good.
3760	9640	The basic idea behind the saying is that while the perfect may be perfect, it's also unchanging
9640	10920	and stagnant.
10920	15340	While the good is good enough, you're not perfect but you're improving every day,
15340	16740	and therefore you're getting better.
16740	21060	This idea makes sense if you understand that human beings can't actually ever obtain
21060	22060	the perfect.
22060	26380	This idea has been expressed many times in many different ways, unrelated to Voltaire's
26380	27980	own formulation of it.
27980	32080	Several Greek philosophers talked about the golden mean, which is the idea that any virtuous
32080	37020	quality taken to excess is no longer virtuous, and that moderation is what gives a thing
37020	38020	its virtue.
38020	40540	A commonly cited example is the virtue of courage.
40540	45400	A deficiency of courage is cowardice, but an excess of courage is recklessness.
45400	49540	In computer programming there's a similar saying, premature optimization is the root
49540	50780	of all evil.
50780	55140	Consider the possibility that it will take you three hours to program a task into a computer.
55140	59840	However, it will take you six hours to program a tool that will automate that task repeatedly.
59840	64780	If the task had to be done 10,000 times, it makes complete sense to spend the extra time
64780	68500	making the tool and then simply have it run while you do something else.
68500	72020	However, if you only have to run the task once, you might as well just manually program
72020	75220	it for three hours rather than making an automated tool for six.
75220	76960	There's a similar problem in space flight.
76960	80700	If human beings wanted to reach another star system, would we launch a ship right now with
80700	84980	our current technology, going as fast as we can make it, with a bunch of frozen embryos
84980	89140	and a computer system designed to manage a colony and basically grow those embryos into
89140	90140	humans?
90140	92980	Or do we wait 100 years when maybe the ships are faster and the computers would be much
92980	93980	more sophisticated?
93980	98460	Sure, we could begin the task right now, but it would seem like adding that 100 years of
98460	103420	prep time would, in the long run, save us a lot more than 100 years of work in actually
103420	104660	completing the task.
104660	107980	Or consider you're playing a video game and you have to fight a really hard boss.
107980	110420	Maybe you can run in and destroy the boss right now.
110420	113280	You need to go and grind levels or collect materials or something.
113280	117180	And maybe at some point you over-prepare so that extra time is kind of wasted, at least
117180	118980	in terms of that specific boss fight.
118980	123380	The point is, you can definitely draw a parabolic arc between the amount of investment made
123380	124380	and a payoff.
124380	127740	On the one hand, you have the complete and total failure of the Enterprise because you
127740	128820	failed to prepare.
128820	132380	On the other end, you have so much time wasted in preparation that it doesn't matter that
132380	133520	you actually won.
133520	135580	You have a victory, but it's become inefficient.
135580	139660	This is also, by the way, the same argument that you can make for lowering taxes actually
139660	141400	increasing tax revenue.
141400	146020	For example, if something is taxed at 100%, well in that case, maybe a large chunk of
146020	150860	the population can't afford to buy that thing regularly, and so sales of it go down,
150860	152140	and so tax revenue goes down.
152140	155660	But let's say you tax it at 20%, suddenly, sales are up.
155660	160180	And as long as sales go up by more than 5 times, which is a definite possibility, then
160180	162180	the government actually collects more tax.
162180	166820	Because even though they're only getting 20% as opposed to 100, that's 80% less tax
166820	169940	the consumer has to pay, which means that they can afford to buy more.
169940	172880	So on that same arc, there's definitely two extremes.
172880	175820	On the one hand, there's no taxes and the government ceases to function.
175820	180060	On the other hand, things are taxed too much and economic activity slows down because people
180060	181060	just can't afford it.
181060	184380	And in the middle, there's that sweet spot where taxes are low enough that people are
184380	188420	buying a lot, and yet they're still high enough that all of those individual purchases
188420	192260	that wouldn't have existed if they were too high are generating even more taxes for
192260	193260	the government.
193260	195500	This is also known as the Pareto Principle.
195500	200540	Alfredo Pareto was an Italian economist, and one of his hobbies was growing beans.
200540	205380	He realized that no matter how many beans he planted, it was 20% of them that actually
205380	210780	produced usable crop, and the other 80% produced either no crop or only enough crop to replant
210780	211980	and not enough to eat.
211980	218020	And then of that top 20%, another 20% produced an even more disproportionate amount of harvestable
218020	219020	beans.
219020	220180	And this doesn't just apply to crops.
220180	223260	It applies to the population of cities as compared to the countryside.
223260	226060	It applies to the distribution of matter in our solar system.
226060	227780	It applies to income inequality.
227780	231980	It's also mapped out by the Fibonacci sequence, which is basically a series of numbers where
231980	234660	each entry is the sum of the previous two entries.
234660	239320	Mapping this out into a spiral pattern creates that weird overlay you often see on top of
239320	242820	artwork and photos, meant to describe something aesthetically pleasing.
242820	245180	It's also what you see when you cut a banana in half.
245180	247880	It's also the pattern in which your hair naturally grows.
247880	250780	If you shave your head and look at the crown, you'll see it spiraling outward.
250780	254020	It also describes the movement of flowers as they grow and twist.
254020	261540	In short, this idea, this natural inequality, seems to be baked into nature in everything.
261540	262780	In biology?
262780	263780	In physics?
263780	264780	In sociology?
264780	268780	It's something that, on some fundamental level, we can't escape, and it does cause
268780	269780	us serious problems.
269780	274220	If a society becomes too unequal, then for all those masses of people who are stuck with
274220	276840	literally nothing, they have nothing to lose.
276840	282400	And to them, destroying everything might be a better shot at getting ahead than working
282400	283400	hard.
283400	285140	And that is something that we do have to avoid.
285140	291760	So yes, all of these various principles and ideas, they do describe the 99% and 1% divide.
291760	299660	They also describe the idea that 1% of the 1% hold 99% of the 1% wealth, as well as 1%
299660	305560	of the 1% of the 1%, holding 99% of the 1% of the 1% wealth.
305560	311360	It's not just that the 1% are this monolithic class of hyper-rich people, it in fact keeps
311360	312360	going upward.
312360	316040	However, what this view of economics fundamentally lacks is time.
316040	321420	For example, half of all American citizens, roughly half I think, have a very high chance
321420	324880	of entering the top 10% for at least part of their life.
324880	330800	40% of all middle class people in the United States will be in the 1%, at least for one
330800	331800	year.
331800	336680	The 1% is not this unchanging class of bankers and fat cats, it constantly churns, people
336680	338440	drop in and out of it all the time.
338440	343760	And when you add time to the equation, you realize that not only does the Pareto Principle,
343760	348040	or the Fibonacci Sequence, or anything else that describes the fundamental inequality
348040	353520	baked into existence, not only do those things describe classes, they also describe you at
353520	355160	different stages of your life.
355160	358680	There will likely be times where you have nothing, and then there will likely be times
358680	361280	where you are wildly successful in at least one thing.
361280	365560	But how does all this relate to the idea of the perfect being the enemy of the good?
365560	370120	Well within the Fibonacci Sequence, the perfect is infinite, and as we all know, no mathematic
370120	372020	sequence ever reaches infinity.
372020	376100	At the end of the day, achieving absolute perfection is impossible, and therefore at
376100	381320	some point, increasing effort results in diminishing returns, and continued activity becomes more
381320	382560	and more inefficient.
382560	386880	This is described by another old proverb, the journey is more important than the destination.
386880	391600	If the destination is perfection, and the journey is being good, then it doesn't actually
391600	395720	matter that you will never reach perfection, because as you continue on the journey, you
395720	397800	will get better at whatever it is you're doing.
397800	402160	This even applies to me, it's better for me to do one video a day, even if some of
402160	406060	the videos are kind of bad, because I get better at my craft by doing them.
406060	410400	If I spend months and months and months working on the perfect video, it's never going to
410400	413760	be perfect, and those months were spent with no content.
413800	417320	Sometimes yes, you do have to set aside time and make a big project, that happens, but
417320	421320	rather than focus on making something truly superb, it's better to constantly try and
421320	424200	fail and improve, because that leads to mastery.
424200	427240	In the realm of politics, this is the utopian's fatal flaw.
427240	430540	Anyone who believes that they can create the perfect world, whether they're religious
430540	435180	and looking to heaven, whether they're communists or socialists, and looking to build the perfectly
435180	439240	equal world where no one suffers, whether they're fascists or Nazis, and they want
439240	443660	the perfectly ordered state, they're all committing what is called the Nirvana Fallacy.
443660	448120	They create a false dichotomy that presents one option that is clearly more advantageous
448120	449120	than the other option.
449120	453320	However, the problem is that the more advantageous option is technically impossible.
453320	457460	This is what you get, for example, when a communist says that their theoretical idea
457460	462260	of what communism is, or should be, is better than the capitalism that we have on the ground
462260	463980	today in the real world.
463980	467840	Well sure, anything that you theorize is certainly going to be better than reality, but that
467840	469540	doesn't mean that the theory works.
469540	475080	It's fundamentally a choice between one realistic achievable possibility and one unrealistic
475080	478680	unachievable possibility that could in some way be better.
478680	482140	The ideal is always going to look better than the situation you find yourself in, but that
482140	484940	doesn't mean that the ideal is realistic or achievable.
484940	488940	Again to go back to computer programming, they have another phrase, worse is better,
488940	492400	where basically the idea is, it doesn't matter if your software is technically better
492400	496300	than other software, if it's not easy to use, it's not going to catch on.
496300	500060	Sometimes things are better because they have less functions and therefore they're
500060	501060	more streamlined.
501060	504760	But what happens when some kind of extremist, whether they're a communist or a fascist
504760	508980	or a religious zealot, or any other kind of extremist that could exist, what happens when
508980	512080	they get caught up in this, when they abandon the good for the perfect?
512080	516460	They ignore the tangibly good humble things they could do around them to make things a
516460	520480	little bit better, and instead aim directly for the top, the perfect, the ideal.
520480	524140	Well firstly, things have to be purified, that's the source of the purity spiral.
524140	529740	Anyone and anything that is not in a line with perfection itself must be disposed of.
529740	534180	Thankfully online that's just deplatforming and de-personing, but in real life it's consistently
534180	535560	led to mass killings.
535560	539580	Once they've created this hypothetical pure space that will never actually exist, they
539580	544300	then expand the space outward to encompass all of reality, so that not only does the
544300	548100	utopia exist, but nothing other than the utopia exists.
548100	552020	This is why, for example, in the political doctrine of fascism, Mussolini writes that
552020	555940	everything must be within the state, nothing must be outside the state, and nothing must
555940	556940	be against the state.
556940	561300	It's also why the communists claim that communism will never work and will never be
561300	564740	true or real unless the entire world is communist.
564740	569340	But perfection itself is also stagnant and unchanging, therefore it must always have
569340	572260	been, and it must always continue to be.
572260	576860	So any of these people, rather than admitting that they changed, they erase history.
576860	581340	This is why you see a lot of people, for example, disavowing their old edgy pasts, whether it's
581340	585340	Eddie Murphy saying that it was a different time when he made those gay jokes, or any
585340	589900	of those people that I mentioned in my Who I Miss video, people that I used to know,
589900	595240	or at least used to look up to, content creators, animators, artists, YouTubers, who ten years
595240	599180	ago would make edgy jokes and now do nothing but virtue signal on Twitter.
599180	605260	It's why you get both ISIS and other Islamic groups, destroying both secular artwork and
605260	609540	the religious figures from other faiths, because only those things that are Islamic must be
609540	610660	allowed to exist.
610660	614740	It's why you get the radical left wanting to destroy statues of confederate generals,
614740	617620	or change the names of universities or other institutions.
617620	622880	David King, in his book The Commissar Vanishes, talked about how the Soviets did this as well.
622880	627440	Photos of Stalin and those around him were routinely doctored after the fact to remove
627440	630940	people who had fallen from power, as if they never existed at all.
630940	633960	And of course, with the Nazis, we know where this ultimately led.
633960	638880	The ethnic cleansing of the Jewish population was actually considered to be a cleansing.
638880	642100	It was, in their eyes, making Germany clean.
642100	645800	And the line of logic, should the Nazis had been allowed to exist for longer than say
645800	652320	12 years, would have gone from Jews can't exist in Germany, to Jews don't exist in Germany,
652320	654480	to Jews never existed at all.
654480	657040	And of course, I would be remiss in not bringing this up.
657040	661640	It's also how you get that crazy We Was Kangs logic, where you get those absolute brainlets
661640	666960	out there who think that the Vikings and the Celts were black for some reason.
666960	671220	If you're siding with the perfect over the good, then regardless of your political persuasion,
671220	674280	you will inevitably find yourself trying to rewrite the past.
674280	678680	The past is problematic and it must be erased, which is what makes it all the more scary
678680	683760	when you hear, for example, Britain's Supreme Court claim that Parliament was not prorogued.
683760	690440	The decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament was unlawful because it had the
690440	697080	effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional
697080	701000	functions without reasonable justification.
701000	705640	This court has already concluded that the Prime Minister's advice to Her Majesty was
705640	709680	unlawful, void and of no effect.
709680	716720	This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect
716720	719200	and should be quashed.
719200	723520	This means that when the Royal Commissioners walked into the House of Lords, it was as
723520	727680	if they had walked in with a blank sheet of paper.
727680	732660	The prorogation was also void and of no effect.
732660	735100	Parliament has not been prorogued.
735100	739240	It is one thing for the Supreme Court to disagree with the prorogation of Parliament, for them
739240	744980	to use whatever powers they have to re-open Parliament and to end it being prorogued.
744980	749340	It's another thing entirely for them to say it was never prorogued in the first place.
749340	754660	Or, on the other side of the pond, consider Nancy Pelosi saying that Trump was not acquitted,
754660	756420	even though he obviously was.
756420	759700	Besides here, but he was acquitted, his poll ratings are high.
759700	760700	There was no equipment.
760700	761700	By the Senate.
761700	764580	You can't have an acquittal unless you have a trial, and you can't have a trial and have
764580	769420	witnesses and documents, so he can say he's acquitted and the headlines can say acquitted,
769420	773260	but he's impeached forever, branded with that and not vindicated.
773540	778900	Yes, Trump was impeached, and yes, he was acquitted, but the past must be rewritten.
778900	780560	Reality itself must be denied.
780560	783560	That was, in fact, the core of the issue in the UK and the US.
783560	787920	A second referendum was desired on Brexit so that it could overwrite the first and pretend
787920	789140	like it never happened.
789140	793400	Trump's impeachment went forward rather than simply trying to oust him in 2020 using the
793400	798800	democratic process, because his presidency, his candidacy, his victory must be erased.
798840	803960	In both of these situations, rather than the left dealing with reality as it is and devising
803960	808680	a better plan for them to move forward, which would be, by the way, pursuing the good, instead
808680	812520	they have to cancel out everything that's happened, which is, fundamentally, pursuing
812520	813520	the perfect.
813520	818120	The perfect is the enemy of the good, because the perfect is the domain only of the ideologue.
818120	822580	The grounded, rational person will still have an ideal, but will understand that he will
822580	823580	never reach it.
823580	827620	That's not an excuse not to try to reach it, though, because in the trying you become better
827620	829020	and better over time.
829020	833780	Yes, on some level you have to accept that the world has fundamental inequality in it,
833780	836260	and that it's not going away no matter how hard you try.
836260	839940	However, that doesn't mean that everything's lost, because the timeline of your life also
839940	841740	has fundamental inequality in it.
841740	846380	A 40-year-old certainly is not the same person, nor is he in the same place, as he was when
846380	848880	he was 30, or 20, or 10.
848880	854060	The good allows for incremental improvements over time, but the perfect is perfect, and
854060	857020	you are not perfect, nor will you ever be.
857020	859700	So if you're smart, you won't be a perfectionist.
859700	862600	You'll pursue incremental improvement over the ideal.
862600	865560	You'll value being better for the benefits it brings you.
865560	870020	Benefits that perfection can't provide, because perfection assumes you already have them.
870020	873860	And if you don't have them, well then you're not perfect, and you need to be purged.
873860	876620	Anyway, that's my thoughts for today.
876620	879580	Don't aim to be the best person you could possibly be.
879580	881220	Just aim to be better than you were yesterday.
881220	882220	You'll get there eventually.
882220	883220	Thanks for listening, my friends.
883220	884220	I love you.
