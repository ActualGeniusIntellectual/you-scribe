0	7200	This is a video I actually once recorded and am now re-recording, because basically Shu on
7200	12000	Head did her stream on Sargon last night, and if I'm going to be honest about this topic I'm going
12000	16960	to have to incorporate some of what she said into the original script. And the original script
16960	24560	started something like this. Sargon and Shu are both wrong. And they're wrong in different ways
24560	28960	for different reasons, but they're both wrong. For those of you who don't know this is about
28960	33760	some ongoing drama and I'll have the videos for both of them linked in the description if you
33760	38160	want to go back and check it out for yourself. Now when watching those previous videos I realized
38160	44560	that Sargon believes he has stayed exactly the same in terms of his overall political views and
44560	52720	his principles, while Shu has spun off radically left into communism. Meanwhile Shu says she's
52720	58240	stayed the same in her principles, while Sargon is going far right. This is the progression of
58240	63440	Sargon's political compass. I know it looks like shit, I pulled it off of his videos. As you can
63440	70160	see back in 2015 he was libertarian left of center and now he is libertarian right of center. And
70160	75840	here's Shu's political compass. In 2015 she was libertarian left of center and now she is
75840	79920	significantly more libertarian and significantly more left. What's interesting is that when you
79920	84640	look at both of these you realize that they started in the same place, and it's probably
84640	90880	why they were such good friends in 2014 and 2015. But after the massive reorientation of the
90880	97440	political landscape, due to basically Brexit and Trump in 2016, you can see they both shifted. And
97440	102080	it looks like they both shifted in about an equal measure, which is probably why they both believe
102080	107840	the other person has changed wildly while they haven't changed at all. The actual truth is they've
107840	113600	both changed an equal amount. Oh by the way just for comparison's sake this is my political compass.
113600	119680	The blue is where I would have been had this this test existed back in like 2007,
120320	126480	and the red is where I have been for nearly the past decade. Now some people would say that the
126480	131440	fact that I've stayed where I am for as long as I have means that I'm still living in the past or
131440	137200	I'm stagnant or something. However I don't think so. I think it's that I've done a lot of reading
137200	142560	and I've come into some very firmly held beliefs that aren't going to be swayed by the politics of
142560	147120	the day. But we've got Shue talking about how Sargon is now far right and Sargon is talking
147120	151760	about how Shue is far left. And I think to really get a grip on the situation we have to ask the
151760	156720	question, what is the left? Because there are sometimes people who tell me that I'm far right
156720	162960	or I'm right wing or something. Then I ask them, well okay what do you think the left is? Like what
162960	170400	do you think the left edge on the center is? What is the right most political opinion that is still
170400	175200	on the left that you can hold? And these people almost inevitably say dismantling capitalism.
175200	180560	Which means that they they have to think that Shuan heads social democrat policies of keeping
180560	187360	capitalism intact but using taxation to maintain a broad safety net. Which by the way are also my
187360	191760	ideal policies. Those people have to think that that's right wing somehow because capitalism's
191760	196720	still intact. Meanwhile people on the right have called me an actual communist because of my
196720	202000	support for those social safety nets. And I know that like left and right changes based on the
202000	206800	Overton window. I know for example the serfs called me right wing because even though I held
206800	211440	positions that were leftist 20 years ago I haven't changed. And they believe that history is supposed
211440	216320	to go more leftward over time which just it just isn't the case. So it really sounds like left and
216320	223120	right are too nebulous to be used. However I think I've come to the root of the problem. The left
223120	229520	right political spectrum came out of the French revolution and its original meaning was in
229520	235040	relation to hierarchy. At this time the right wing believed that hierarchy was innately destructive
235040	241120	while at the same time being inevitable. So the point of human politics was to understand and
241120	248080	accept the natural hierarchies of the world but to not create any more man-made hierarchies than
248080	254160	were absolutely necessary. This is why you had both your small government types as well as your
254160	258800	monarchists and loyalists on the right because they believed that the monarchy was a hierarchy
258800	264720	of the natural world wherein divine right came from god and so the hierarchy was god kings nobles
264720	269120	and peasants. The left wing meanwhile had a different relationship with hierarchy. They
269120	275120	believed hierarchy was just as destructive as the right wing did however they believed that hierarchy
275120	279840	could be tamed by human intervention. While the right wing did not believe in constructing a
279840	284400	man-made hierarchy because hierarchy itself was destructive the left wing believed that if humans
284400	289840	could replace natural hierarchies with man-made hierarchies they could control them for people's
289840	294880	wider benefit. Their philosophy was not to avoid hierarchy because it's destructive but to harness
294880	300160	hierarchy and make it constructive. This had the strange effect of not only having the monarchists
300160	305360	the anarchists and the proto-libertarians all on the right wing but also the socialists and
305360	312320	the fascists on the left wing because both socialism and fascism seek to create a centralized
312320	318240	planned society which is completely in line with the 1800s leftist philosophy of replacing
318240	323280	natural hierarchy with man-made hierarchy and although it sounds very strange to us nowadays
323280	328640	because on the modern left-right political spectrum we put fascism as far right but George
328640	334800	Valois France's first fascist of any note began his political career as an anarcho-syndicalist.
334800	340480	He viewed fascism as left-wing and as coming out of his own experiences with socialism and he saw
340480	346880	fascism as the natural extension and inheritor of the Jacobin movement from the late 1700s. The
346880	352240	Jacobins were one of the most radically left-wing revolutionary groups within the French Revolution.
352240	357680	They were a group of working-class Paris citizens that played vital roles during the French
357680	362240	Revolution. Of course the modern conception of the left and the right has completely lost
362240	367120	all of this nuance mainly because after it became popularized within the French Republic
367120	372640	the Americans picked it up and as the Americans like to do they completely watered it down beyond
372640	379440	any and all actual meaning. Thanks America. So now modern day political discourse is basically just
379440	385280	shit flinging over who's left who's right who's far left who's far right no you're actually the
385280	390560	radical one no you're actually the radical one when most of it is just a complete misunderstanding
390560	394560	however not all of it and this is where we actually talk about the specific things where
394560	398880	Sargon and Shu are wrong. During Shu's stream she mentioned she didn't understand the link between
398880	404240	communism and woke shit and I don't think Sargon did a very good job at explaining it necessarily
404240	411760	so maybe I can do it in in more layman's terms. I don't understand her objection to woke politics
412480	420800	without also not being a communist. Now he's like I don't understand how you can reject woke shit
420800	428880	and also not be a communist where the fuck did that come from I thought the entire thing was
428880	434880	we are on the left but we're bothered by some things on the left. Woke shit is the application
434880	441600	of Marxist theory to vectors of oppression beyond simply class. Now Shu says that he doesn't mind
441600	446400	being called a class justice warrior and there is definitely this idea among some elements of
446400	452400	the left that there is no war but class war however if you take Marxist theory and apply it
452400	459120	to the social sphere rather than the economic one you get identity politics you get woke shit you
459120	464320	get intersectionality in fact if you take like a women's studies class in university one of the
464320	470080	first things you learn is that the Marxist conception of class and class warfare is simply
470080	476000	one bar on the cage of intersectionality alongside race and gender and sexual orientation
476000	482160	and all these other things. It is very easy to see how woke shit is the natural end result of
482160	486560	Marxist theory. Shu also said in her stream that she doesn't see the problem with socialism even
486560	493040	though she's not a socialist herself. The people who think socialism is some like authoritarian
493040	502720	thing it's not um and so when they think of that they think of like the tankies they think of like
503360	509200	Stalin and all that shit and it scares them and I think that's where these people are coming from
510000	516640	but they're completely different ideologies. And the honest truth is no socialism is just as bad
516640	521840	as fascism for multiple reasons. Firstly if you read the theory and I have I have read the theory
521840	526320	you know I have read Das Kapital uh if you read the theory you can you understand that the
526320	532000	political system and the economic system can't really be disentangled. Comparing Nazis to
532000	543520	socialists is like not valid at all at all no workers rights and shit like that compared to
543520	549360	people who want like racial purity and all this shit are completely two completely completely
549360	553520	different things and dev keeps doing it like I'm friends with dev but he keeps conflating
554240	559520	the socialists to the Nazis. Socialism isn't the government does shit socialism is not workers
559520	566000	rights it's not health care socialism isn't an intact capitalism with safety nets socialism is
566000	571360	property expropriation it is seizing the means of production and you know I get it the old Marxist
571360	576640	conception required a revolution it was going to require a violent uprising of the worker to steal
576640	582080	all of this property and there are new versions of socialism you know you you read your Chomsky
582080	587040	you see the libertarian socialists out there and it's not going to require a violent revolution
587040	591840	guys we're just going to vote it you know you're democratic socialists you're libertarian socialist
591840	596720	you're just going to vote yourself property well that is still fundamentally tyrannical because
596720	602240	let's say you own a business and let's say you've hired some workers and the workers all say okay
602240	608000	we're going to vote that we own your business now and the owner says no fuck off I founded it
608000	612240	you know however many years ago it was I was working on it before I hired any of you
612240	616880	there is no good reason why you should own it simply because you work here and at that point
616880	621440	the democratic socialism the libertarian socialism completely falls apart because either you have to
621440	625920	give up and go home or you're going to have to use violence to take the property now maybe that
625920	629040	state-backed violence and if that's the case you're going to become the Soviet Union a whole
629040	635120	lot faster maybe it's union-based violence maybe it's a grassroots uprising by the workers but all
635120	639600	of these things are still theft and they're all going to lead to an authoritarian state like I've
639600	644480	read Chomsky I had to read him in school I know you don't want to hear this because he's well
644480	649680	regarded among the left he's considered an intellectual people love this guy but when it
649680	655520	comes to his libertarian socialism if ever seriously put into practice it will end up
655520	660720	like its authoritarian brother because you will always have to use extreme amounts of force
660720	666240	to make people play along with it and this is coming from a former Chomsky fan man I had stars
666240	671680	in my eyes about him once too until I decided to read all theory not just socialist theory
671680	675600	in the same way she was also wrong about fascism and I know people are like wait
676240	681200	but nazis were socialist yes because Germany was socialist or well they were you know they
681200	689120	had like health care and shit like that so yeah nazis were they were they adopted the socialist
689120	694080	thing because that was what was popular at the time like to get into power no the fascists did
694080	699040	not simply use socialist rhetoric until they got into power you're probably referencing here
699040	705360	Hitler's 25-point plan which was put up by the Nazi party I think in 1923 and it had a lot of
705360	711040	socialist points on it like it talked about old age welfare it talked about uh care for the middle
711040	716160	and lower classes it talked about the expropriation of land for the purposes of public utility
716160	721840	it talked about outlawing child labor and education programs and things like this this was
721840	728000	not simply a ruse on behalf of the fascists these are actually core components of fascist policy
728000	732800	because again due to the old conception of the left and its relation to hierarchy this is a topic
732800	737440	another video but a lot of people on the left believe that liberal and fascist economics are
737440	741360	identical because they're both capitalist and that's just not the case there actually is a
741360	746800	distinct fascist theory of economics separate from both liberalism and socialism but again that's
746800	751200	another topic for another time I mean there is a reason why in the doctrine of fascism
751200	756400	Mussolini wrote about his political opponents including socialists being reactionaries or how
756400	760720	they wanted to seize the means of production and it was not simply co-opting their language
760720	764720	there's something deeper there and I know where you get this definition of fascism it's where all
764720	770160	of bread tube gets the definition of fascism that they use it's from omberto eco's your fascism
770160	775840	essay and I had the displeasure of reading omberto eco even before I became a youtuber I think in the
775840	780800	class where I read the essay or fascism my political science professor said there's a reason why eco
780800	787360	is known outside of italy for his novels and not his political analysis the 14 points presented
787360	795200	in our fascism are so ridiculously broad that any authoritarianism fascism or otherwise can meet
795200	801520	this criteria even some non-authoritarians can meet this criteria and if this list is how people
801520	807040	on the left identify fascism it is no wonder that they see fascists everywhere it's no wonder that
807040	812640	you think trump is a fascist and frankly trump's not a fascist he's just an idiot eco's work in
812640	818000	terms of political science is considered like the opposite of the gold standard when it comes
818000	824640	to identifying a fascist if you want an actual coherent definition of fascism there's frederick
824640	830000	hayek's the road to serfdom or roger griffin's the nature of fascism or if you just really like
830000	836480	the idea of a checklist you can just run down and mark off very simply check out emilio gentile's
836480	842000	the sacralization of politics I've read these works I've read ur fascism admittedly it's been
842000	846640	a while it was back when I was still in university taking political science but I've read this stuff
846640	852400	and guess what by all those other metrics trump isn't a fascist why the fuck do we know everything
852400	857360	about them but they know nothing about us why the fuck do we use all their correct labels this one's
857360	861360	a libertarian this one's a neo-con this one's a classical liberal this one's a nationalist
861360	867440	and they just turn around and call whole ass libs commies now maybe it's because I consider myself
867440	870880	at least slightly left of center here but I can in fact tell the differences between all the
870880	876080	different flavors of leftism and I do think sargon is wrong to call them all communism there's an
876080	880720	obvious difference between the tankies and the anarcho communists and the anarcho syndicalists
880720	885440	and the libertarian socialists and the social democrats and so on and so forth and you can't
885440	890560	simply boil them all down to just straight communism because frankly communism is the
890560	896960	theorized stateless moneyless classless society that exists after socialism has been perfectly
896960	902240	implemented which is itself a wildly reductionary point of view however the problem with all of
902240	907920	these different flavors of leftism is that once you cross the threshold into property expropriation
907920	913440	like I said earlier they all turn out the same way to take property from those who don't want it
913440	919440	stolen and to legitimize that taking beyond simple thievery you will need some kind of totalitarian
919440	923520	state apparatus it doesn't matter if you call yourself an anarcho communist or whatever the
923520	928480	anarcho part is ultimately meaningless it will by necessity be washed aside in the pursuit of
928480	935360	your own goals all forms of socialism libertarian or not will eventually become the soviet union
935360	939840	the only difference is how long it takes for you to get there all this being said sargon's not
939840	945280	perfect either like I mentioned not everything on the left is simple communism there are in fact
945280	950960	socialists who simply want to be socialists they don't want to advance to the next stage which is
951280	955920	communism they want to implement a socialist society and then stay in a socialist society
955920	958880	i don't agree with them because that would ultimately be tyrannical and would lead to
958880	963600	something that looks a lot like fascism however you can't call them communist because that's not
963600	967520	what they are and that's not what they believe moreover just like how shu says she hasn't shifted
967520	972320	when she actually has sargon you've shifted too you keep calling yourself a liberal but frankly
972320	976160	i don't think you are anymore i think you're a conservative and i'm not using that word in a
976160	981920	negative way at all i don't have a natural knee-jerk reaction to hate conservatives
981920	986800	like a lot of people do you know this yourself you know it better than me that conservatism as
986800	992080	a political tradition comes out of liberalism they are two sides of the same coin the liberals
992080	997040	not in terms of like the mimetic way that the term is used like how the left refers to the libs
997040	1002640	or the right refers to the libs but the actual political philosophy of liberalism it starts at
1002640	1007680	the same premise as conservatism their difference is not on whether or not the state should be
1007680	1012880	overthrown or whether democracy should disappear or anything along those lines the difference is
1013520	1017920	in the minutia of how the system works but they both start from the same premise that the system
1017920	1023040	is fundamentally good that the nation and the culture in which you inhabit is worth preserving
1023040	1028560	on some level the conservatives want to conserve the liberals want to liberate but both still
1028560	1033040	within that framework of the night watchman state and sometimes the liberals are correct for a given
1033040	1039440	situation sometimes the conservatives are so it's not like i'm using the term conservative as a slur
1039440	1044640	i just think at this point sargon that is where you fall politically it's not bad it's not evil
1044640	1049840	it's not wrong it's just you and i don't blame you i mean you're a dad now you've got a son and
1049840	1054080	a daughter and i know that you're trying for more so like who's not going to become a conservative
1054080	1059120	under those conditions it's not bad it's not wrong it's just what it is and speaking of kids
1059120	1062640	yes we're going to have to talk about the whole women have a duty to have kids thing i'm pretty
1062640	1066720	sure you phrase it that way because you want to trigger people primarily and you know fair enough
1066720	1071440	it can be funny sometimes because i also know that you think that men have a duty to have kids it's
1071440	1076080	not just women but what you're appealing to here fundamentally is the duty to contribute to a
1076080	1081120	society that has brought you up and fair enough i just don't think that having children is the
1081120	1085680	only way that you can do that and to be honest i think the capitalist conception of things works
1085680	1090400	quite well if you have money that means you've performed labor or if you're an investor you've
1090400	1095200	taken on risk but for most people it means you've performed labor and that labor is itself your
1095200	1099840	contribution if you can pay for something that means that you have contributed enough so that
1099840	1105920	you may have it you do not need to have kids in order to justify buying your house or paying your
1105920	1110880	grocery bill or whatever it is fundamentally you should have kids because you want to have kids
1110880	1115200	because that's what you want to do with your life and your time and your energy we already know how
1115200	1122080	bad it can be when people who don't want kids have kids how it ruins the parents life how it
1122080	1126880	definitely ruins the child's life it's only a contribution if you want them because if you
1126880	1130880	want them then you're going to raise them right and of course the problem with using the word duty
1130880	1135440	is that most people don't understand i understand but most people don't understand that duty is not
1135440	1139040	something that you're forced to do a duty is something that you voluntarily pick up so when
1139040	1143600	you say something like you have a duty to have children that doesn't mean that you want the state
1143600	1149200	to force you to have children it means that you have a duty and you can choose not to fulfill that
1149200	1154080	duty it is a voluntary burden which is the difference between duty and responsibility
1154080	1159440	where responsibility is not voluntary when you have a responsibility you have to do that thing
1159440	1164640	when you have a duty you should do that thing so i see what you're saying but and this has also been
1164640	1170000	a pretty consistent problem i think is that sargon you often don't properly unpack your
1170000	1175040	points another instance of this is where you say what is the definition of woman again i know what
1175040	1180960	you're saying but most people just think you're crazy frankly because your point is the definition
1180960	1186080	of woman is adult human female it's very simple it's concise and the left does not have a
1186080	1191920	definition of woman that simultaneously includes trans women and also isn't circular i understand
1191920	1196880	your point this applies to both the duty thing and the definition of woman thing i think you
1196880	1202240	forget that you've been doing this for like six years and for most people who are not this deep
1202240	1208240	into it they kind of need some concepts unpacked first you can't simply spring a question on them
1208240	1215680	and then watch as they are confused and then you go haha i owned you well no not really unfortunately
1215680	1220400	the confusion that you're seeing is not them being owned as they struggle to to say something
1220400	1225760	that actually makes coherent sense but rather it's them thinking you're insane you also said
1225760	1230960	on a stream recently that you didn't think universal suffrage was the way to go now you
1230960	1235920	were saying this off hand so maybe you were just i don't know working through an idea and it's not
1235920	1243200	a firmly held belief or something but your logic was that why should people who not net pay into
1243200	1249440	the system through taxation have a vote in where those taxes go through democracy and i get what
1249440	1255360	you're saying but i disagree it's appropriate in the private sector for things to be a little bit
1255360	1260080	more dictatorial i know that the the left-leaning types the socialists they're not going to like to
1260080	1265680	hear that but it's the honest truth if you own your property you have the exclusive right to
1265680	1270960	enjoy that property in any way that you see fit if you own a company you have the exclusive right to
1270960	1277120	control that company to hire and fire to drive it into the ground if you want to but governments
1277120	1283120	aren't companies public property is not private property just as there is a private sphere because
1283120	1288800	not everything is political despite what the left will tell you there is also a public sphere there
1288800	1295440	is a place where within those boundaries everything is actually political and i do think it's important
1295440	1301120	that specifically within that zone everyone has their voice heard because everybody has to live
1301120	1306640	in the country that is created by the government that we vote in it is appropriate for a democratic
1306640	1313280	government to have universal suffrage for the same reasons that it is appropriate for a company
1313280	1320240	not to this is the unfortunate nature of being a content mill like crowder or like ben shapiro
1320240	1325360	or like vosh the serfs and sargon this applies to you too do you recall how christy winters was
1325360	1331520	viewed a few years ago how basically she would constantly release videos and those videos were
1331520	1337200	always like worthy of somebody else just putting on while they play a game on a stream or something
1337200	1342320	and then talking over and laughing at that is what everyone's become including you to an extent
1342320	1346560	yes vosh and the serfs have become this yes crowder and shapiro have become this
1346560	1352160	pacman and kolinsky and everyone else and you everyone nowadays seems to be a constantly
1352160	1356640	producing content mill and all of their opponents simply take that content and create their own
1356640	1363040	content easy response videos laughs even if they don't actually have any real criticism
1363040	1368800	and i mean you and i both know you go and watch vosh critiquing anything and there's never any
1368800	1373520	real criticism there it's usually him like stumbling and going uh what i don't understand
1373520	1378800	how could you possibly uh like there's nothing really there of substance but it feeds his base
1378800	1383040	this is not just an optics complaint because i know you don't care about optics and frankly
1383040	1389920	neither do i it's more like i keep meeting people good people well-intentioned people
1390480	1396240	and you have too i mean remember our conversation with lilith right who have these preconceptions
1396240	1400800	about you that are completely wrong and i know they're completely wrong and you know they're
1400800	1406400	completely wrong but it's because you have allowed people who dislike you to interpret you
1407040	1412480	uncharitably like yeah four years ago the sjw said you were an ethno nationalist and everyone
1412480	1417040	could see it wasn't true but the number of people who are saying it now has increased like a hundred
1417040	1424080	fold and it's all good people who if they knew the truth wouldn't be saying it and in fact i think
1424800	1428560	ceding ground like this has has been a consistent problem with you and how you operate
1429280	1433920	i know you it was you i and arch who had that private conversation about compassion
1434560	1437680	and the nature of compassion and how compassion intersects with politics
1438320	1442640	and how basically conservatives and in some cases liberals to their detriment
1443280	1449040	have completely ceded the idea of compassion to the socialists and we like you and i both know
1449040	1454480	the socialists aren't actually compassionate at all property expropriation is not compassionate
1454480	1458800	despite how they they claim they want to make the world a better place or redistribute or help the
1458800	1464320	poor or whatever it is we we both know exactly what they mean by that exactly what will happen
1464400	1469360	when they do that and it's nothing that that's even remotely related to compassion however the
1469360	1476080	concept of compassion has been ceded to the far left and frankly i think that's a problem because
1476080	1480320	i do think it's possible for there to be a compassionate right there's definitely a space
1480320	1485200	for a compassionate center and i do think that that comes with equal parts self-empowerment
1485200	1490320	and social assistance where it's needed and where it would be productive but simply hand-waving that
1490320	1495360	is bleeding heart hippie leftists is not going to help the situation you've always been content to
1496240	1500400	ignore those people around you who might be working against you and fair enough because
1500400	1506720	most of the time it's just internet shit it's just gay ops right however i've always said that
1507520	1514000	it is better to defeat an opponent on their own turf it is better to accept their terms and still
1514000	1519600	beat them and i know for a fact that is possible with the radical left i know for a fact it's
1519600	1524480	possible with the socialists in the same vein you and i have had a conversation on where it's
1524480	1529280	actually appropriate that the government step in into a marketplace and intervene and i laid out
1529280	1535200	three criteria that you disagreed with but i didn't really understand why i said when something is
1535200	1542960	rarely used but is universally necessary when it is used and is extremely expensive then the
1542960	1548800	government has a mandate to step in maybe communalize the service that everyone pays into
1548800	1552720	a pot and everyone withdraws from it when they need it and ensures that everyone has at least
1552720	1558240	some access to that service and while that's not going to be as efficient as the free market
1558240	1563440	it is going to be more fair so for example this works with roads you are not going to use every
1563440	1568880	single road that your government has built in your country however everyone needs roads and
1568880	1573520	they are expensive to make so it does make sense that the government enforces some minimum of
1573520	1578560	standard beyond what the market would bear this logic makes sense for roads it makes sense for
1578560	1583360	fire and police it makes sense for health care in my opinion but where i break with shu and the
1583360	1589200	socialists is that i don't think it makes sense for food or for housing because in terms of food
1589200	1594320	it's not rarely used it's commonly used it is universally necessary and it's not prohibitively
1594320	1599120	expensive the way that roads or fire or police or health care is and it doesn't work with housing
1599120	1604720	because unlike those four other examples which are services housing is a good when you buy a
1604720	1609840	house you have exclusive rights to that house you own that house as property there is nothing
1609840	1614000	universal about owning a house it is very exclusive in that regard and of course there
1614000	1617840	are other things that you're both wrong about as well i agree with shu on the whole flag burning
1617840	1622640	thing i'm worried about trump talking about making it illegal it should not be illegal at all there
1622640	1628400	are trump simps out there who are saying oh it's only one year no one second in jail is one second
1628400	1633520	too many for burning a flag at the same time i also understand that your point was lost on shu
1633520	1637520	because the issue isn't burning the flag the issue is why do they want to burn it and
1637520	1642640	do they have real grievances and frankly the answer for a lot of them is no a lot of people
1642640	1647040	that you see rioting out there they're not the working poor they're rich kids sometimes middle
1647040	1650560	class kids who have been radicalized and are committing violence thinking they're doing
1650560	1655200	something good simple as that i know that this doesn't apply to shu i know that she's ultimately
1655200	1661040	a patriot but there is definitely a strain of leftism out there that is very anti-american
1661040	1667200	and while the flag burning isn't a problem the whole no trump no wall no usa at all mentality
1667200	1672560	that is behind the flag burning is absolutely a problem and in the same way i think you're
1672560	1677600	also both wrong about george floyd shu called sargon a fentanyl truther which is in my opinion
1677600	1682880	ridiculous a police officer kneeling on the neck of a violent person is standard procedure and
1682880	1688160	almost never actually results in anybody's death and in fact it would not have resulted in george
1688160	1693280	floyd's death had he not been overdosing on fentanyl at the exact same time this is
1693280	1698720	indisputable it's in the autopsy you're not a fentanyl truther for saying this but at the same
1698720	1704000	time you cannot simply believe that the police acted completely appropriately they obviously
1704000	1710160	didn't the police are first responders they do have a duty of care to those that they arrest
1710160	1716080	they have a level of responsibility above and beyond that of an average passerby to make sure
1716080	1721760	that someone doesn't die while in their custody it doesn't matter what george floyd was guilty of
1721760	1727520	he should have seen his day in court that is where justice is served and yes i've seen the body cam
1727520	1732480	footage they were struggling with him it was a nasty situation however when they had him on the
1732480	1738640	ground and he was overdosing their actions absolutely exacerbated the situation and they
1738640	1744720	are responsible for that anyway that's that for now i know i talked about doing sfo streams those
1744720	1750000	will probably be starting tomorrow i think this will probably be the um the last video until i
1750000	1754400	can get a handle on the monetization situation maybe i'll do something else if it strikes me
1754400	1760880	but like i have several very large video essays planned like on the scale of the chas one that
1760880	1765120	i'm just gonna hold off on so uh i'll be streaming probably more carrion tonight on twitch if you
1765120	1772720	want to drop by and i'll be live hopefully tomorrow with some kind of sfo stream so i'll see you there
1772720	1774800	i love you
