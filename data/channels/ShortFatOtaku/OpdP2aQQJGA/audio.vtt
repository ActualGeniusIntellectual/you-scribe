00:00.000 --> 00:07.200
This is a video I actually once recorded and am now re-recording, because basically Shu on

00:07.200 --> 00:12.000
Head did her stream on Sargon last night, and if I'm going to be honest about this topic I'm going

00:12.000 --> 00:16.960
to have to incorporate some of what she said into the original script. And the original script

00:16.960 --> 00:24.560
started something like this. Sargon and Shu are both wrong. And they're wrong in different ways

00:24.560 --> 00:28.960
for different reasons, but they're both wrong. For those of you who don't know this is about

00:28.960 --> 00:33.760
some ongoing drama and I'll have the videos for both of them linked in the description if you

00:33.760 --> 00:38.160
want to go back and check it out for yourself. Now when watching those previous videos I realized

00:38.160 --> 00:44.560
that Sargon believes he has stayed exactly the same in terms of his overall political views and

00:44.560 --> 00:52.720
his principles, while Shu has spun off radically left into communism. Meanwhile Shu says she's

00:52.720 --> 00:58.240
stayed the same in her principles, while Sargon is going far right. This is the progression of

00:58.240 --> 01:03.440
Sargon's political compass. I know it looks like shit, I pulled it off of his videos. As you can

01:03.440 --> 01:10.160
see back in 2015 he was libertarian left of center and now he is libertarian right of center. And

01:10.160 --> 01:15.840
here's Shu's political compass. In 2015 she was libertarian left of center and now she is

01:15.840 --> 01:19.920
significantly more libertarian and significantly more left. What's interesting is that when you

01:19.920 --> 01:24.640
look at both of these you realize that they started in the same place, and it's probably

01:24.640 --> 01:30.880
why they were such good friends in 2014 and 2015. But after the massive reorientation of the

01:30.880 --> 01:37.440
political landscape, due to basically Brexit and Trump in 2016, you can see they both shifted. And

01:37.440 --> 01:42.080
it looks like they both shifted in about an equal measure, which is probably why they both believe

01:42.080 --> 01:47.840
the other person has changed wildly while they haven't changed at all. The actual truth is they've

01:47.840 --> 01:53.600
both changed an equal amount. Oh by the way just for comparison's sake this is my political compass.

01:53.600 --> 01:59.680
The blue is where I would have been had this this test existed back in like 2007,

02:00.320 --> 02:06.480
and the red is where I have been for nearly the past decade. Now some people would say that the

02:06.480 --> 02:11.440
fact that I've stayed where I am for as long as I have means that I'm still living in the past or

02:11.440 --> 02:17.200
I'm stagnant or something. However I don't think so. I think it's that I've done a lot of reading

02:17.200 --> 02:22.560
and I've come into some very firmly held beliefs that aren't going to be swayed by the politics of

02:22.560 --> 02:27.120
the day. But we've got Shue talking about how Sargon is now far right and Sargon is talking

02:27.120 --> 02:31.760
about how Shue is far left. And I think to really get a grip on the situation we have to ask the

02:31.760 --> 02:36.720
question, what is the left? Because there are sometimes people who tell me that I'm far right

02:36.720 --> 02:42.960
or I'm right wing or something. Then I ask them, well okay what do you think the left is? Like what

02:42.960 --> 02:50.400
do you think the left edge on the center is? What is the right most political opinion that is still

02:50.400 --> 02:55.200
on the left that you can hold? And these people almost inevitably say dismantling capitalism.

02:55.200 --> 03:00.560
Which means that they they have to think that Shuan heads social democrat policies of keeping

03:00.560 --> 03:07.360
capitalism intact but using taxation to maintain a broad safety net. Which by the way are also my

03:07.360 --> 03:11.760
ideal policies. Those people have to think that that's right wing somehow because capitalism's

03:11.760 --> 03:16.720
still intact. Meanwhile people on the right have called me an actual communist because of my

03:16.720 --> 03:22.000
support for those social safety nets. And I know that like left and right changes based on the

03:22.000 --> 03:26.800
Overton window. I know for example the serfs called me right wing because even though I held

03:26.800 --> 03:31.440
positions that were leftist 20 years ago I haven't changed. And they believe that history is supposed

03:31.440 --> 03:36.320
to go more leftward over time which just it just isn't the case. So it really sounds like left and

03:36.320 --> 03:43.120
right are too nebulous to be used. However I think I've come to the root of the problem. The left

03:43.120 --> 03:49.520
right political spectrum came out of the French revolution and its original meaning was in

03:49.520 --> 03:55.040
relation to hierarchy. At this time the right wing believed that hierarchy was innately destructive

03:55.040 --> 04:01.120
while at the same time being inevitable. So the point of human politics was to understand and

04:01.120 --> 04:08.080
accept the natural hierarchies of the world but to not create any more man-made hierarchies than

04:08.080 --> 04:14.160
were absolutely necessary. This is why you had both your small government types as well as your

04:14.160 --> 04:18.800
monarchists and loyalists on the right because they believed that the monarchy was a hierarchy

04:18.800 --> 04:24.720
of the natural world wherein divine right came from god and so the hierarchy was god kings nobles

04:24.720 --> 04:29.120
and peasants. The left wing meanwhile had a different relationship with hierarchy. They

04:29.120 --> 04:35.120
believed hierarchy was just as destructive as the right wing did however they believed that hierarchy

04:35.120 --> 04:39.840
could be tamed by human intervention. While the right wing did not believe in constructing a

04:39.840 --> 04:44.400
man-made hierarchy because hierarchy itself was destructive the left wing believed that if humans

04:44.400 --> 04:49.840
could replace natural hierarchies with man-made hierarchies they could control them for people's

04:49.840 --> 04:54.880
wider benefit. Their philosophy was not to avoid hierarchy because it's destructive but to harness

04:54.880 --> 05:00.160
hierarchy and make it constructive. This had the strange effect of not only having the monarchists

05:00.160 --> 05:05.360
the anarchists and the proto-libertarians all on the right wing but also the socialists and

05:05.360 --> 05:12.320
the fascists on the left wing because both socialism and fascism seek to create a centralized

05:12.320 --> 05:18.240
planned society which is completely in line with the 1800s leftist philosophy of replacing

05:18.240 --> 05:23.280
natural hierarchy with man-made hierarchy and although it sounds very strange to us nowadays

05:23.280 --> 05:28.640
because on the modern left-right political spectrum we put fascism as far right but George

05:28.640 --> 05:34.800
Valois France's first fascist of any note began his political career as an anarcho-syndicalist.

05:34.800 --> 05:40.480
He viewed fascism as left-wing and as coming out of his own experiences with socialism and he saw

05:40.480 --> 05:46.880
fascism as the natural extension and inheritor of the Jacobin movement from the late 1700s. The

05:46.880 --> 05:52.240
Jacobins were one of the most radically left-wing revolutionary groups within the French Revolution.

05:52.240 --> 05:57.680
They were a group of working-class Paris citizens that played vital roles during the French

05:57.680 --> 06:02.240
Revolution. Of course the modern conception of the left and the right has completely lost

06:02.240 --> 06:07.120
all of this nuance mainly because after it became popularized within the French Republic

06:07.120 --> 06:12.640
the Americans picked it up and as the Americans like to do they completely watered it down beyond

06:12.640 --> 06:19.440
any and all actual meaning. Thanks America. So now modern day political discourse is basically just

06:19.440 --> 06:25.280
shit flinging over who's left who's right who's far left who's far right no you're actually the

06:25.280 --> 06:30.560
radical one no you're actually the radical one when most of it is just a complete misunderstanding

06:30.560 --> 06:34.560
however not all of it and this is where we actually talk about the specific things where

06:34.560 --> 06:38.880
Sargon and Shu are wrong. During Shu's stream she mentioned she didn't understand the link between

06:38.880 --> 06:44.240
communism and woke shit and I don't think Sargon did a very good job at explaining it necessarily

06:44.240 --> 06:51.760
so maybe I can do it in in more layman's terms. I don't understand her objection to woke politics

06:52.480 --> 07:00.800
without also not being a communist. Now he's like I don't understand how you can reject woke shit

07:00.800 --> 07:08.880
and also not be a communist where the fuck did that come from I thought the entire thing was

07:08.880 --> 07:14.880
we are on the left but we're bothered by some things on the left. Woke shit is the application

07:14.880 --> 07:21.600
of Marxist theory to vectors of oppression beyond simply class. Now Shu says that he doesn't mind

07:21.600 --> 07:26.400
being called a class justice warrior and there is definitely this idea among some elements of

07:26.400 --> 07:32.400
the left that there is no war but class war however if you take Marxist theory and apply it

07:32.400 --> 07:39.120
to the social sphere rather than the economic one you get identity politics you get woke shit you

07:39.120 --> 07:44.320
get intersectionality in fact if you take like a women's studies class in university one of the

07:44.320 --> 07:50.080
first things you learn is that the Marxist conception of class and class warfare is simply

07:50.080 --> 07:56.000
one bar on the cage of intersectionality alongside race and gender and sexual orientation

07:56.000 --> 08:02.160
and all these other things. It is very easy to see how woke shit is the natural end result of

08:02.160 --> 08:06.560
Marxist theory. Shu also said in her stream that she doesn't see the problem with socialism even

08:06.560 --> 08:13.040
though she's not a socialist herself. The people who think socialism is some like authoritarian

08:13.040 --> 08:22.720
thing it's not um and so when they think of that they think of like the tankies they think of like

08:23.360 --> 08:29.200
Stalin and all that shit and it scares them and I think that's where these people are coming from

08:30.000 --> 08:36.640
but they're completely different ideologies. And the honest truth is no socialism is just as bad

08:36.640 --> 08:41.840
as fascism for multiple reasons. Firstly if you read the theory and I have I have read the theory

08:41.840 --> 08:46.320
you know I have read Das Kapital uh if you read the theory you can you understand that the

08:46.320 --> 08:52.000
political system and the economic system can't really be disentangled. Comparing Nazis to

08:52.000 --> 09:03.520
socialists is like not valid at all at all no workers rights and shit like that compared to

09:03.520 --> 09:09.360
people who want like racial purity and all this shit are completely two completely completely

09:09.360 --> 09:13.520
different things and dev keeps doing it like I'm friends with dev but he keeps conflating

09:14.240 --> 09:19.520
the socialists to the Nazis. Socialism isn't the government does shit socialism is not workers

09:19.520 --> 09:26.000
rights it's not health care socialism isn't an intact capitalism with safety nets socialism is

09:26.000 --> 09:31.360
property expropriation it is seizing the means of production and you know I get it the old Marxist

09:31.360 --> 09:36.640
conception required a revolution it was going to require a violent uprising of the worker to steal

09:36.640 --> 09:42.080
all of this property and there are new versions of socialism you know you you read your Chomsky

09:42.080 --> 09:47.040
you see the libertarian socialists out there and it's not going to require a violent revolution

09:47.040 --> 09:51.840
guys we're just going to vote it you know you're democratic socialists you're libertarian socialist

09:51.840 --> 09:56.720
you're just going to vote yourself property well that is still fundamentally tyrannical because

09:56.720 --> 10:02.240
let's say you own a business and let's say you've hired some workers and the workers all say okay

10:02.240 --> 10:08.000
we're going to vote that we own your business now and the owner says no fuck off I founded it

10:08.000 --> 10:12.240
you know however many years ago it was I was working on it before I hired any of you

10:12.240 --> 10:16.880
there is no good reason why you should own it simply because you work here and at that point

10:16.880 --> 10:21.440
the democratic socialism the libertarian socialism completely falls apart because either you have to

10:21.440 --> 10:25.920
give up and go home or you're going to have to use violence to take the property now maybe that

10:25.920 --> 10:29.040
state-backed violence and if that's the case you're going to become the Soviet Union a whole

10:29.040 --> 10:35.120
lot faster maybe it's union-based violence maybe it's a grassroots uprising by the workers but all

10:35.120 --> 10:39.600
of these things are still theft and they're all going to lead to an authoritarian state like I've

10:39.600 --> 10:44.480
read Chomsky I had to read him in school I know you don't want to hear this because he's well

10:44.480 --> 10:49.680
regarded among the left he's considered an intellectual people love this guy but when it

10:49.680 --> 10:55.520
comes to his libertarian socialism if ever seriously put into practice it will end up

10:55.520 --> 11:00.720
like its authoritarian brother because you will always have to use extreme amounts of force

11:00.720 --> 11:06.240
to make people play along with it and this is coming from a former Chomsky fan man I had stars

11:06.240 --> 11:11.680
in my eyes about him once too until I decided to read all theory not just socialist theory

11:11.680 --> 11:15.600
in the same way she was also wrong about fascism and I know people are like wait

11:16.240 --> 11:21.200
but nazis were socialist yes because Germany was socialist or well they were you know they

11:21.200 --> 11:29.120
had like health care and shit like that so yeah nazis were they were they adopted the socialist

11:29.120 --> 11:34.080
thing because that was what was popular at the time like to get into power no the fascists did

11:34.080 --> 11:39.040
not simply use socialist rhetoric until they got into power you're probably referencing here

11:39.040 --> 11:45.360
Hitler's 25-point plan which was put up by the Nazi party I think in 1923 and it had a lot of

11:45.360 --> 11:51.040
socialist points on it like it talked about old age welfare it talked about uh care for the middle

11:51.040 --> 11:56.160
and lower classes it talked about the expropriation of land for the purposes of public utility

11:56.160 --> 12:01.840
it talked about outlawing child labor and education programs and things like this this was

12:01.840 --> 12:08.000
not simply a ruse on behalf of the fascists these are actually core components of fascist policy

12:08.000 --> 12:12.800
because again due to the old conception of the left and its relation to hierarchy this is a topic

12:12.800 --> 12:17.440
another video but a lot of people on the left believe that liberal and fascist economics are

12:17.440 --> 12:21.360
identical because they're both capitalist and that's just not the case there actually is a

12:21.360 --> 12:26.800
distinct fascist theory of economics separate from both liberalism and socialism but again that's

12:26.800 --> 12:31.200
another topic for another time I mean there is a reason why in the doctrine of fascism

12:31.200 --> 12:36.400
Mussolini wrote about his political opponents including socialists being reactionaries or how

12:36.400 --> 12:40.720
they wanted to seize the means of production and it was not simply co-opting their language

12:40.720 --> 12:44.720
there's something deeper there and I know where you get this definition of fascism it's where all

12:44.720 --> 12:50.160
of bread tube gets the definition of fascism that they use it's from omberto eco's your fascism

12:50.160 --> 12:55.840
essay and I had the displeasure of reading omberto eco even before I became a youtuber I think in the

12:55.840 --> 13:00.800
class where I read the essay or fascism my political science professor said there's a reason why eco

13:00.800 --> 13:07.360
is known outside of italy for his novels and not his political analysis the 14 points presented

13:07.360 --> 13:15.200
in our fascism are so ridiculously broad that any authoritarianism fascism or otherwise can meet

13:15.200 --> 13:21.520
this criteria even some non-authoritarians can meet this criteria and if this list is how people

13:21.520 --> 13:27.040
on the left identify fascism it is no wonder that they see fascists everywhere it's no wonder that

13:27.040 --> 13:32.640
you think trump is a fascist and frankly trump's not a fascist he's just an idiot eco's work in

13:32.640 --> 13:38.000
terms of political science is considered like the opposite of the gold standard when it comes

13:38.000 --> 13:44.640
to identifying a fascist if you want an actual coherent definition of fascism there's frederick

13:44.640 --> 13:50.000
hayek's the road to serfdom or roger griffin's the nature of fascism or if you just really like

13:50.000 --> 13:56.480
the idea of a checklist you can just run down and mark off very simply check out emilio gentile's

13:56.480 --> 14:02.000
the sacralization of politics I've read these works I've read ur fascism admittedly it's been

14:02.000 --> 14:06.640
a while it was back when I was still in university taking political science but I've read this stuff

14:06.640 --> 14:12.400
and guess what by all those other metrics trump isn't a fascist why the fuck do we know everything

14:12.400 --> 14:17.360
about them but they know nothing about us why the fuck do we use all their correct labels this one's

14:17.360 --> 14:21.360
a libertarian this one's a neo-con this one's a classical liberal this one's a nationalist

14:21.360 --> 14:27.440
and they just turn around and call whole ass libs commies now maybe it's because I consider myself

14:27.440 --> 14:30.880
at least slightly left of center here but I can in fact tell the differences between all the

14:30.880 --> 14:36.080
different flavors of leftism and I do think sargon is wrong to call them all communism there's an

14:36.080 --> 14:40.720
obvious difference between the tankies and the anarcho communists and the anarcho syndicalists

14:40.720 --> 14:45.440
and the libertarian socialists and the social democrats and so on and so forth and you can't

14:45.440 --> 14:50.560
simply boil them all down to just straight communism because frankly communism is the

14:50.560 --> 14:56.960
theorized stateless moneyless classless society that exists after socialism has been perfectly

14:56.960 --> 15:02.240
implemented which is itself a wildly reductionary point of view however the problem with all of

15:02.240 --> 15:07.920
these different flavors of leftism is that once you cross the threshold into property expropriation

15:07.920 --> 15:13.440
like I said earlier they all turn out the same way to take property from those who don't want it

15:13.440 --> 15:19.440
stolen and to legitimize that taking beyond simple thievery you will need some kind of totalitarian

15:19.440 --> 15:23.520
state apparatus it doesn't matter if you call yourself an anarcho communist or whatever the

15:23.520 --> 15:28.480
anarcho part is ultimately meaningless it will by necessity be washed aside in the pursuit of

15:28.480 --> 15:35.360
your own goals all forms of socialism libertarian or not will eventually become the soviet union

15:35.360 --> 15:39.840
the only difference is how long it takes for you to get there all this being said sargon's not

15:39.840 --> 15:45.280
perfect either like I mentioned not everything on the left is simple communism there are in fact

15:45.280 --> 15:50.960
socialists who simply want to be socialists they don't want to advance to the next stage which is

15:51.280 --> 15:55.920
communism they want to implement a socialist society and then stay in a socialist society

15:55.920 --> 15:58.880
i don't agree with them because that would ultimately be tyrannical and would lead to

15:58.880 --> 16:03.600
something that looks a lot like fascism however you can't call them communist because that's not

16:03.600 --> 16:07.520
what they are and that's not what they believe moreover just like how shu says she hasn't shifted

16:07.520 --> 16:12.320
when she actually has sargon you've shifted too you keep calling yourself a liberal but frankly

16:12.320 --> 16:16.160
i don't think you are anymore i think you're a conservative and i'm not using that word in a

16:16.160 --> 16:21.920
negative way at all i don't have a natural knee-jerk reaction to hate conservatives

16:21.920 --> 16:26.800
like a lot of people do you know this yourself you know it better than me that conservatism as

16:26.800 --> 16:32.080
a political tradition comes out of liberalism they are two sides of the same coin the liberals

16:32.080 --> 16:37.040
not in terms of like the mimetic way that the term is used like how the left refers to the libs

16:37.040 --> 16:42.640
or the right refers to the libs but the actual political philosophy of liberalism it starts at

16:42.640 --> 16:47.680
the same premise as conservatism their difference is not on whether or not the state should be

16:47.680 --> 16:52.880
overthrown or whether democracy should disappear or anything along those lines the difference is

16:53.520 --> 16:57.920
in the minutia of how the system works but they both start from the same premise that the system

16:57.920 --> 17:03.040
is fundamentally good that the nation and the culture in which you inhabit is worth preserving

17:03.040 --> 17:08.560
on some level the conservatives want to conserve the liberals want to liberate but both still

17:08.560 --> 17:13.040
within that framework of the night watchman state and sometimes the liberals are correct for a given

17:13.040 --> 17:19.440
situation sometimes the conservatives are so it's not like i'm using the term conservative as a slur

17:19.440 --> 17:24.640
i just think at this point sargon that is where you fall politically it's not bad it's not evil

17:24.640 --> 17:29.840
it's not wrong it's just you and i don't blame you i mean you're a dad now you've got a son and

17:29.840 --> 17:34.080
a daughter and i know that you're trying for more so like who's not going to become a conservative

17:34.080 --> 17:39.120
under those conditions it's not bad it's not wrong it's just what it is and speaking of kids

17:39.120 --> 17:42.640
yes we're going to have to talk about the whole women have a duty to have kids thing i'm pretty

17:42.640 --> 17:46.720
sure you phrase it that way because you want to trigger people primarily and you know fair enough

17:46.720 --> 17:51.440
it can be funny sometimes because i also know that you think that men have a duty to have kids it's

17:51.440 --> 17:56.080
not just women but what you're appealing to here fundamentally is the duty to contribute to a

17:56.080 --> 18:01.120
society that has brought you up and fair enough i just don't think that having children is the

18:01.120 --> 18:05.680
only way that you can do that and to be honest i think the capitalist conception of things works

18:05.680 --> 18:10.400
quite well if you have money that means you've performed labor or if you're an investor you've

18:10.400 --> 18:15.200
taken on risk but for most people it means you've performed labor and that labor is itself your

18:15.200 --> 18:19.840
contribution if you can pay for something that means that you have contributed enough so that

18:19.840 --> 18:25.920
you may have it you do not need to have kids in order to justify buying your house or paying your

18:25.920 --> 18:30.880
grocery bill or whatever it is fundamentally you should have kids because you want to have kids

18:30.880 --> 18:35.200
because that's what you want to do with your life and your time and your energy we already know how

18:35.200 --> 18:42.080
bad it can be when people who don't want kids have kids how it ruins the parents life how it

18:42.080 --> 18:46.880
definitely ruins the child's life it's only a contribution if you want them because if you

18:46.880 --> 18:50.880
want them then you're going to raise them right and of course the problem with using the word duty

18:50.880 --> 18:55.440
is that most people don't understand i understand but most people don't understand that duty is not

18:55.440 --> 18:59.040
something that you're forced to do a duty is something that you voluntarily pick up so when

18:59.040 --> 19:03.600
you say something like you have a duty to have children that doesn't mean that you want the state

19:03.600 --> 19:09.200
to force you to have children it means that you have a duty and you can choose not to fulfill that

19:09.200 --> 19:14.080
duty it is a voluntary burden which is the difference between duty and responsibility

19:14.080 --> 19:19.440
where responsibility is not voluntary when you have a responsibility you have to do that thing

19:19.440 --> 19:24.640
when you have a duty you should do that thing so i see what you're saying but and this has also been

19:24.640 --> 19:30.000
a pretty consistent problem i think is that sargon you often don't properly unpack your

19:30.000 --> 19:35.040
points another instance of this is where you say what is the definition of woman again i know what

19:35.040 --> 19:40.960
you're saying but most people just think you're crazy frankly because your point is the definition

19:40.960 --> 19:46.080
of woman is adult human female it's very simple it's concise and the left does not have a

19:46.080 --> 19:51.920
definition of woman that simultaneously includes trans women and also isn't circular i understand

19:51.920 --> 19:56.880
your point this applies to both the duty thing and the definition of woman thing i think you

19:56.880 --> 20:02.240
forget that you've been doing this for like six years and for most people who are not this deep

20:02.240 --> 20:08.240
into it they kind of need some concepts unpacked first you can't simply spring a question on them

20:08.240 --> 20:15.680
and then watch as they are confused and then you go haha i owned you well no not really unfortunately

20:15.680 --> 20:20.400
the confusion that you're seeing is not them being owned as they struggle to to say something

20:20.400 --> 20:25.760
that actually makes coherent sense but rather it's them thinking you're insane you also said

20:25.760 --> 20:30.960
on a stream recently that you didn't think universal suffrage was the way to go now you

20:30.960 --> 20:35.920
were saying this off hand so maybe you were just i don't know working through an idea and it's not

20:35.920 --> 20:43.200
a firmly held belief or something but your logic was that why should people who not net pay into

20:43.200 --> 20:49.440
the system through taxation have a vote in where those taxes go through democracy and i get what

20:49.440 --> 20:55.360
you're saying but i disagree it's appropriate in the private sector for things to be a little bit

20:55.360 --> 21:00.080
more dictatorial i know that the the left-leaning types the socialists they're not going to like to

21:00.080 --> 21:05.680
hear that but it's the honest truth if you own your property you have the exclusive right to

21:05.680 --> 21:10.960
enjoy that property in any way that you see fit if you own a company you have the exclusive right to

21:10.960 --> 21:17.120
control that company to hire and fire to drive it into the ground if you want to but governments

21:17.120 --> 21:23.120
aren't companies public property is not private property just as there is a private sphere because

21:23.120 --> 21:28.800
not everything is political despite what the left will tell you there is also a public sphere there

21:28.800 --> 21:35.440
is a place where within those boundaries everything is actually political and i do think it's important

21:35.440 --> 21:41.120
that specifically within that zone everyone has their voice heard because everybody has to live

21:41.120 --> 21:46.640
in the country that is created by the government that we vote in it is appropriate for a democratic

21:46.640 --> 21:53.280
government to have universal suffrage for the same reasons that it is appropriate for a company

21:53.280 --> 22:00.240
not to this is the unfortunate nature of being a content mill like crowder or like ben shapiro

22:00.240 --> 22:05.360
or like vosh the serfs and sargon this applies to you too do you recall how christy winters was

22:05.360 --> 22:11.520
viewed a few years ago how basically she would constantly release videos and those videos were

22:11.520 --> 22:17.200
always like worthy of somebody else just putting on while they play a game on a stream or something

22:17.200 --> 22:22.320
and then talking over and laughing at that is what everyone's become including you to an extent

22:22.320 --> 22:26.560
yes vosh and the serfs have become this yes crowder and shapiro have become this

22:26.560 --> 22:32.160
pacman and kolinsky and everyone else and you everyone nowadays seems to be a constantly

22:32.160 --> 22:36.640
producing content mill and all of their opponents simply take that content and create their own

22:36.640 --> 22:43.040
content easy response videos laughs even if they don't actually have any real criticism

22:43.040 --> 22:48.800
and i mean you and i both know you go and watch vosh critiquing anything and there's never any

22:48.800 --> 22:53.520
real criticism there it's usually him like stumbling and going uh what i don't understand

22:53.520 --> 22:58.800
how could you possibly uh like there's nothing really there of substance but it feeds his base

22:58.800 --> 23:03.040
this is not just an optics complaint because i know you don't care about optics and frankly

23:03.040 --> 23:09.920
neither do i it's more like i keep meeting people good people well-intentioned people

23:10.480 --> 23:16.240
and you have too i mean remember our conversation with lilith right who have these preconceptions

23:16.240 --> 23:20.800
about you that are completely wrong and i know they're completely wrong and you know they're

23:20.800 --> 23:26.400
completely wrong but it's because you have allowed people who dislike you to interpret you

23:27.040 --> 23:32.480
uncharitably like yeah four years ago the sjw said you were an ethno nationalist and everyone

23:32.480 --> 23:37.040
could see it wasn't true but the number of people who are saying it now has increased like a hundred

23:37.040 --> 23:44.080
fold and it's all good people who if they knew the truth wouldn't be saying it and in fact i think

23:44.800 --> 23:48.560
ceding ground like this has has been a consistent problem with you and how you operate

23:49.280 --> 23:53.920
i know you it was you i and arch who had that private conversation about compassion

23:54.560 --> 23:57.680
and the nature of compassion and how compassion intersects with politics

23:58.320 --> 24:02.640
and how basically conservatives and in some cases liberals to their detriment

24:03.280 --> 24:09.040
have completely ceded the idea of compassion to the socialists and we like you and i both know

24:09.040 --> 24:14.480
the socialists aren't actually compassionate at all property expropriation is not compassionate

24:14.480 --> 24:18.800
despite how they they claim they want to make the world a better place or redistribute or help the

24:18.800 --> 24:24.320
poor or whatever it is we we both know exactly what they mean by that exactly what will happen

24:24.400 --> 24:29.360
when they do that and it's nothing that that's even remotely related to compassion however the

24:29.360 --> 24:36.080
concept of compassion has been ceded to the far left and frankly i think that's a problem because

24:36.080 --> 24:40.320
i do think it's possible for there to be a compassionate right there's definitely a space

24:40.320 --> 24:45.200
for a compassionate center and i do think that that comes with equal parts self-empowerment

24:45.200 --> 24:50.320
and social assistance where it's needed and where it would be productive but simply hand-waving that

24:50.320 --> 24:55.360
is bleeding heart hippie leftists is not going to help the situation you've always been content to

24:56.240 --> 25:00.400
ignore those people around you who might be working against you and fair enough because

25:00.400 --> 25:06.720
most of the time it's just internet shit it's just gay ops right however i've always said that

25:07.520 --> 25:14.000
it is better to defeat an opponent on their own turf it is better to accept their terms and still

25:14.000 --> 25:19.600
beat them and i know for a fact that is possible with the radical left i know for a fact it's

25:19.600 --> 25:24.480
possible with the socialists in the same vein you and i have had a conversation on where it's

25:24.480 --> 25:29.280
actually appropriate that the government step in into a marketplace and intervene and i laid out

25:29.280 --> 25:35.200
three criteria that you disagreed with but i didn't really understand why i said when something is

25:35.200 --> 25:42.960
rarely used but is universally necessary when it is used and is extremely expensive then the

25:42.960 --> 25:48.800
government has a mandate to step in maybe communalize the service that everyone pays into

25:48.800 --> 25:52.720
a pot and everyone withdraws from it when they need it and ensures that everyone has at least

25:52.720 --> 25:58.240
some access to that service and while that's not going to be as efficient as the free market

25:58.240 --> 26:03.440
it is going to be more fair so for example this works with roads you are not going to use every

26:03.440 --> 26:08.880
single road that your government has built in your country however everyone needs roads and

26:08.880 --> 26:13.520
they are expensive to make so it does make sense that the government enforces some minimum of

26:13.520 --> 26:18.560
standard beyond what the market would bear this logic makes sense for roads it makes sense for

26:18.560 --> 26:23.360
fire and police it makes sense for health care in my opinion but where i break with shu and the

26:23.360 --> 26:29.200
socialists is that i don't think it makes sense for food or for housing because in terms of food

26:29.200 --> 26:34.320
it's not rarely used it's commonly used it is universally necessary and it's not prohibitively

26:34.320 --> 26:39.120
expensive the way that roads or fire or police or health care is and it doesn't work with housing

26:39.120 --> 26:44.720
because unlike those four other examples which are services housing is a good when you buy a

26:44.720 --> 26:49.840
house you have exclusive rights to that house you own that house as property there is nothing

26:49.840 --> 26:54.000
universal about owning a house it is very exclusive in that regard and of course there

26:54.000 --> 26:57.840
are other things that you're both wrong about as well i agree with shu on the whole flag burning

26:57.840 --> 27:02.640
thing i'm worried about trump talking about making it illegal it should not be illegal at all there

27:02.640 --> 27:08.400
are trump simps out there who are saying oh it's only one year no one second in jail is one second

27:08.400 --> 27:13.520
too many for burning a flag at the same time i also understand that your point was lost on shu

27:13.520 --> 27:17.520
because the issue isn't burning the flag the issue is why do they want to burn it and

27:17.520 --> 27:22.640
do they have real grievances and frankly the answer for a lot of them is no a lot of people

27:22.640 --> 27:27.040
that you see rioting out there they're not the working poor they're rich kids sometimes middle

27:27.040 --> 27:30.560
class kids who have been radicalized and are committing violence thinking they're doing

27:30.560 --> 27:35.200
something good simple as that i know that this doesn't apply to shu i know that she's ultimately

27:35.200 --> 27:41.040
a patriot but there is definitely a strain of leftism out there that is very anti-american

27:41.040 --> 27:47.200
and while the flag burning isn't a problem the whole no trump no wall no usa at all mentality

27:47.200 --> 27:52.560
that is behind the flag burning is absolutely a problem and in the same way i think you're

27:52.560 --> 27:57.600
also both wrong about george floyd shu called sargon a fentanyl truther which is in my opinion

27:57.600 --> 28:02.880
ridiculous a police officer kneeling on the neck of a violent person is standard procedure and

28:02.880 --> 28:08.160
almost never actually results in anybody's death and in fact it would not have resulted in george

28:08.160 --> 28:13.280
floyd's death had he not been overdosing on fentanyl at the exact same time this is

28:13.280 --> 28:18.720
indisputable it's in the autopsy you're not a fentanyl truther for saying this but at the same

28:18.720 --> 28:24.000
time you cannot simply believe that the police acted completely appropriately they obviously

28:24.000 --> 28:30.160
didn't the police are first responders they do have a duty of care to those that they arrest

28:30.160 --> 28:36.080
they have a level of responsibility above and beyond that of an average passerby to make sure

28:36.080 --> 28:41.760
that someone doesn't die while in their custody it doesn't matter what george floyd was guilty of

28:41.760 --> 28:47.520
he should have seen his day in court that is where justice is served and yes i've seen the body cam

28:47.520 --> 28:52.480
footage they were struggling with him it was a nasty situation however when they had him on the

28:52.480 --> 28:58.640
ground and he was overdosing their actions absolutely exacerbated the situation and they

28:58.640 --> 29:04.720
are responsible for that anyway that's that for now i know i talked about doing sfo streams those

29:04.720 --> 29:10.000
will probably be starting tomorrow i think this will probably be the um the last video until i

29:10.000 --> 29:14.400
can get a handle on the monetization situation maybe i'll do something else if it strikes me

29:14.400 --> 29:20.880
but like i have several very large video essays planned like on the scale of the chas one that

29:20.880 --> 29:25.120
i'm just gonna hold off on so uh i'll be streaming probably more carrion tonight on twitch if you

29:25.120 --> 29:32.720
want to drop by and i'll be live hopefully tomorrow with some kind of sfo stream so i'll see you there

29:32.720 --> 29:34.800
i love you
