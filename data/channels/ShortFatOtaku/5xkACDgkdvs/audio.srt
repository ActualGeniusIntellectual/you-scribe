00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Hello everyone and welcome to This Week in Stupid for the 30th of September 2018, because

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,160
I will no longer be producing This Week in Stupid, Dev from Shofar Taku, will be uploading

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,400
content to my main channel. I'm tired though, you know? I'm tired.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,400
Thank you very much, Sargon. Rest assured that while you're sleeping off your low dopamine

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,580
levels, This Week in Stupid is in good hands. And just so I don't break tradition, today

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,300
I have vanilla hazelnut coffee, and man, is it tasty.

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,000
And the subject of this week's episode is university stupidity, so let's jump right

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,460
into it. A mathematician says activists made his paper disappear because its findings offended

9
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,560
them. At behest of a feminist professor, an academic journal's board reportedly threatened

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,820
to harass the journal until it died. Theodore Hill, a retired professor of mathematics at

11
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,280
Georgia Tech, claims that activists successfully pressured the New York Journal of Mathematics

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,240
to delete an article he had written for the academic journal because it considered a politically

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,760
incorrect subject, the achievement gap between men and women at very high levels of human

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:20,520
intelligence. See, it doesn't even say what stance this professor took on this subject,

15
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,920
it's that he was considering it. If you consider it now, you have to be banned, you have to

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,860
be censored, you have to be thrown out, your journal has to be harassed until it dies.

17
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:36,200
The greater male variability hypothesis, first proposed by Charles Darwin, suggests that

18
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,380
there are more men than women at both the bottom and the very top of the distribution

19
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,440
for intelligence scores. More men than women are Nobel Prize winners and chess grand champions,

20
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:51,600
and more men than women are homeless, unemployed, and in prison. Men as a group express greater

21
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,800
variability in aptitude and ability. This difference, of course, need not be innate.

22
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,880
It could be the case that social custom and pressure... hold on a second guys, it's my

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:15,400
girlfriend... hey! What do you want? I'm currently live and the phone's right up against the

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:23,960
mic, say hello! Hi guys, I didn't know you were live. Okay, what's going on? Nope, nevermind,

25
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:30,560
not an important question at all, just leave. Bye. You're worse than V! I'm gonna get in

26
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,400
shit for that later. So the whole point of the greater male variability hypothesis is

27
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:42,400
basically that because men are more biologically disposable than women are, nature kind of

28
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,400
has more free rein to tinker with them and to see what works and what doesn't in terms

29
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,720
of random mutations. And this is obvious because, you know, in order to secure reproduction,

30
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,520
men have to have sex for like, at the very least, the absolute minimum, a couple of minutes,

31
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,760
meanwhile women have to carry the child for nine months. So biologically speaking, men

32
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,480
are just not as valuable. Socially speaking, of course, we can have a completely different

33
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,940
conversation there, but biologically speaking, that is just the way it is. So, if random

34
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,680
mutations have to happen, it's better overall for them to happen in the males of a species

35
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,720
than in the females. Which I think makes sense, because, you know, one woman who gets knocked

36
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,880
out of the game, that's a far bigger hit to a population biologically than one man that

37
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,760
gets knocked out of the game. So, nature will tinker around with random mutations in men,

38
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,880
sometimes they're bad and they become fucking losers, sometimes they're good and they become

39
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,000
gifted geniuses or something. Hill says that he and a co-author came up with a theoretical

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,880
model that would help explain the gap, then attempted to publish a paper about their work

41
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:59,720
in Mathematical Intelligencer. The paper was accepted, though the topic is controversial.

42
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,400
Larry Summers resigned as president of Harvard University, in part due to criticism he received

43
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,000
for broaching the subject of variability at an academic conference. This subject of variability

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:18,400
is one, the truth, and two, it's a political minefield right now, because people just don't

45
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,740
want to hear that maybe there's a biological component to some things. Now you're being

46
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,720
a biological essentialist or something ridiculous like that. As might have been anticipated,

47
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:38,160
the paper was poorly received by feminist scholars. Hill's co-author, Sergei Tabachatkinov,

48
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,040
faced strident opposition at Penn State, where he is employed as a professor of mathematics.

49
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,840
According to Hill, at a faculty meeting the week before, the department head had explained

50
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,740
that sometimes values such as academic freedom and free speech come into conflict with other

51
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,820
values to which Penn State was committed. Well guess what? When that conflict happens,

52
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:04,540
academic freedom and free speech should win. A female colleague had then instructed Sergei

53
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:10,120
that he needed to admit and fight bias, adding that the belief that women have a lesser chance

54
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:16,300
to succeed in mathematics at the very top end is bias. Sergei had said that he had spent

55
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,340
endless hours talking to people who explained that the paper was bad and harmful, and tried

56
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,200
to convince him to withdraw my name to restore peace at the department and to avoid losing

57
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,980
whatever political capital I may still have. This is just basically the SJWs, the feminists,

58
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,540
the postmodernists trying to bully him into capitulation, saying no, it doesn't matter

59
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,140
what your research says, this is a political decision and you have to abide by it. The

60
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:47,220
National Science Foundation eventually wrote to him, asking that he remove from the paper

61
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,780
any acknowledgement that the NSF had helped to fund the research. This was done, according

62
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,480
to Hill, after two Penn State academics, the chair of the Climate and Diversity Committee

63
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:03,060
and the associate head for diversity and equity, had warned the NSF that the paper promotes

64
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,940
ideas detrimental to the advancement of women in science and at odds with the values of

65
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:14,140
the NSF. And also the truth. I mean, this is where it gets particularly ridiculous.

66
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:19,020
You see SJWs in video games, like with the gamergate, or you see Comixgate, or something

67
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:25,780
like that, and those things are obviously bad, but it's like, I mean, I hate to really

68
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:31,860
bring this up, but it really is just entertainment, right? Like, obviously I don't want this to

69
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,720
happen here, but it's not super, super important, but when it happens to suppress legitimate

70
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:46,180
studies, studies with a factual backing, studies with some real meat and potatoes behind them,

71
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:52,240
this is extremely dangerous because now they're saying that their ideology has to take precedent

72
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,880
over reality itself. Mathematical intelligence rescinded its acceptance of the paper. According

73
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,240
to its editor in chief, publishing Hill and Russian's work would create a very real possibility

74
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,520
that the right wing media may pick this up and hype it internationally. Well, guess what?

75
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,420
The Streisand effect kicked in, and now people know about this, you idiots. Moreover, it's

76
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,160
not saying that women can't compete at a high level. It's saying that they're less likely

77
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,100
to be able to do so due to all of these factors. There are still exceptional women. Oh, fuck's

78
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,960
it. Okay. In this Colette piece, Hill claims that a University of Chicago mathematics professor

79
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,080
Amy Wilkinson lobbied the journal to abandon its plans to publish the piece. Sometime later,

80
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,120
an editor at another publication, the New York Journal of Mathematics, wrote to Hill

81
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,400
and offered to publish the paper. Hill accepted, and the article was published. But then, three

82
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,200
days later, the paper had vanished. And a few days after that, a completely different

83
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:58,440
paper by different authors appeared at exactly the same page of the same volume, volume 23,

84
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:07,240
page 1641, where mine had once been. As it turns out, Amy Wilkinson is married to Benson

85
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:13,400
Farb, a member of the NYJM editorial board. Upon discovering that the journal had published

86
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:20,960
my paper, Professor Barb had written a furious email to the NYJM editor-in-chief Mark Steinenberger

87
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,860
demanding that it be deleted at once. Unaware of any of this, I wrote to Steinberger on

88
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,700
November 14th to find out what had happened. I pointed out that if the deletion were permanent,

89
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,900
it would leave me in an impossible position. I would not be able to republish anywhere

90
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,520
else, because I would be unable to sign a copyright form declaring that it had not been

91
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,260
already published elsewhere. Steinberger replied later that day. Half his board, he explained

92
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:51,220
unhappily, had told him that unless he pulled the article, they would all resign and harass

93
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:56,820
the journal he had founded 25 years earlier until it died. Faced with the loss of his

94
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,980
own scientific legacy, he had capitulated. A publication in a dead journal, he offered,

95
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,000
wouldn't help you. This is how far these people are willing to go. They will worm their way

96
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,120
into any institution. They will put themselves on any board. As soon as they have a foot

97
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,260
in the door, they will start bringing in other people who will push their own ideology. And

98
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,820
then as soon as they hit critical mass, as soon as the scale tips, they start censoring

99
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,200
everything they don't like. And the media is complicit in this too, because as we all

100
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,240
know, math is racist. How data is driving inequality on CNN tech of all places. It's

101
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,340
no surprise that inequality in the US is on the rise, but what you might not know is that

102
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:46,220
math is partly to blame. In a new book, Weapons of Math Destruction, Kathy O'Neill details

103
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,580
all the ways that math is essentially being used for evil. My word, not hers. Well, at

104
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,720
least we know who the idiot is then. From targeted advertising and insurance to education

105
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,420
and policing, O'Neill looks at how algorithms and big data are targeting the poor, reinforcing

106
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:09,120
racism, and amplifying inequality. These WMDs, as she calls them, have three key features.

107
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,340
They are opaque, scalable, and unfair. Denied a job because of a personality test? Too bad.

108
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,780
The algorithm said you wouldn't be a good fit. Charged a higher rate for a loan? Well,

109
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:26,220
people in your zip code tend to be riskier borrowers. Received a harsher prison sentence?

110
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,840
Here's the thing, your friends and family have criminal records too, so you're likely

111
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,780
to be a repeat offender. Spoiler alert, the people on the receiving end of these messages

112
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,720
don't actually get the explanation. Here's the interesting thing. One, all this data

113
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,880
collection, it's happening by Facebook and by Google and by Twitter and by all of these

114
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:54,120
big tech companies that also likes to suppress conservatives and is run entirely by leftist

115
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,820
people. Two, all of these situations that you're talking about, the personality tests,

116
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:06,300
it's grouping you in as an individual into a group of people with a similar personality.

117
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,420
The zip code example, you're being grouped into people that you live near. The prison

118
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,780
sentence example, you're being grouped in with your friends and family. These are all

119
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,940
collectivist judgments, not individualist judgments, and that's kind of the problem.

120
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,420
That's why whenever an SJW talks about collectivism, because they're racial activists or they're

121
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,480
gender activists or something, this is the kind of stuff they're ushering in. They're

122
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,760
saying it's okay to judge people based on group characteristics rather than assuming

123
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:40,120
the inherent supremacy of the individual. So now we can do shit like this. Okay. Okay.

124
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,840
Okay. If we're going to say that you are a white male or you are a black female, then

125
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,480
how come we can't say that, oh, you're part of this neighborhood. Oh, you're part of this

126
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:58,480
family. Oh, you're, you're part of this socioeconomic group and just judge you like that. That is

127
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:04,880
what SJWs have brought back from the fucking dark ages of the pre 1960s. Of course, when

128
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,400
data is used by the left, everything's fine. But when it's used by other people, it's suddenly

129
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:17,400
white privilege because the democratic rep said, citing uncomfortable data is white privilege.

130
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,600
Republican Iowa representative Steve King found himself accused of using his white privilege

131
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:30,640
last week after he offered statistics that democratic Louisiana rep Cedric Richmond didn't

132
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,440
like. It all started at a house judiciary committee hearing where King brought up the

133
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,500
high crime rates of Central American nations that many immigrants hail from. King called

134
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,680
the violence of countries like El Salvador shocking, but then pointed out that some cities

135
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,300
in the US have comparable murder rates. And that talk infuriated representative Richmond

136
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,460
who represents parts of New Orleans, one of the cities that he mentioned, we just had

137
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,780
a conversation about this. We're going to lose all civility in this community. If he

138
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,220
thinks it's appropriate to compare New Orleans to Guatemala, Richmond fumed while incorrectly

139
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,140
identifying the nation King was speaking of. Oops. The committee chairman, Republican Virginia

140
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,300
representative Bob Goodlatte tried to calm down the situation by pointing out the obvious.

141
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:18,080
The gentleman from Iowa has the right to make a statistical comparison between two locations,

142
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,120
but that only made the congressional black caucus member get even angrier and bring up

143
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,200
the inevitable KKK comparison. You are comparing the people in the location. That would be

144
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,500
like me comparing him to somebody in the Klan. I don't have the basis to do that. Richmond

145
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,600
retorted to Goodlatte before humble bragging what how civil and bipartisan he is. Okay,

146
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:43,220
I have a feeling that this article might not be completely unbiased. But he said, it's

147
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,880
not appropriate. It's insensitive. And it's nothing more than a traditional white privilege

148
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,000
of let me criticize a minority city. I take it how you want. I'm telling you how I feel.

149
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,800
That's kind of the problem of putting all your chips on collectivism, isn't it? If you

150
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,560
identify as some stripe of racial collectivist, whether it be like a white supremacist, or

151
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:07,520
a Black Lives Matter person or whatever, then other people can just simply judge you based

152
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,400
on the statistical truths of your group. I mean, if you don't want to be judged as individual

153
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:19,880
Cedric Richmond, but rather as a part of a black community, well, then we can judge

154
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:25,080
you by the actions of that black community. I don't think you want that, do you? I don't

155
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,120
think you want to have all the crimes of the black community pinned on your shoulders,

156
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,560
do you? And this is the ultimate problem with collectivism, because it makes all of that

157
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:39,820
data from from the previous article relevant, frankly. And this applies to both collectivism

158
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:46,900
on the left and collectivism on the right. It really seems to be right now the centrists

159
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,880
that are the only group that promotes actual individualism that says no, you can't judge

160
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,000
people because of their race, or their sex, or their economic status, or where they live

161
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,560
or any of that nonsense, you just judge them as individuals, and make individual judgments

162
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,860
as you meet them. That seems to be the only way forward. Because things aren't getting

163
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,780
better. They're getting worse. And right now, SJWs are to blame. They're not the only

164
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,720
collectivists that exist in the world, but they're certainly the ones with the most power

165
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,680
right now. And finally, we get to peak university stupidity with student editor who retweeted

166
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:29,020
article pointing out that women don't have penises is fired from University Journal.

167
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:40,120
A student editor at a top university has been fired in a transphobia row after he tweeted

168
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:48,220
that women don't have penises. Remember when I said that ideology has to take precedence

169
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:54,200
over reality? Angelos Sophakalos, I don't fucking know. Angelos, assistant editor at

170
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,620
Durham University's philosophy journal Critique, was sacked from his post after just three

171
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:07,100
days for writing a tweet deemed transphobic by fellow students. He's 24, he's from Cyprus.

172
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:12,080
He faces disciplinary action last month after he retweeted an article by The Spectator on

173
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:18,960
his Twitter titled, is it a crime to say women don't have penises? With the comment, RT,

174
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:24,820
if women don't have penises. He's technically not even saying here that he thinks women

175
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:32,300
don't have penises. He's simply saying that, is it a crime to say so? And asking his followers

176
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,760
if they think so or not, asking for RTs if they do, retweets. The postgraduate philosophy

177
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,580
and psychology student was dismissed from his position at the university after the tweet

178
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:46,400
sparked outrage. He was also fired from his position as editor of Durham University's

179
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,440
online magazine, The Bubble, and forced to resign as president of Free Speech Society

180
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:59,100
Humanist Students. Oh, oh, really? So he has to resign from the Free Speech Society over

181
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,520
speech? Wait, wait, wait, wait. He didn't even tweet it. So he did actually take a stand

182
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,620
on whether or not women have penises, but he didn't even tweet anything. He simply retweeted

183
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:15,140
somebody else's tweet. He was fired for a retweet. The since deleted tweet has received

184
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,120
backlash from former chair of LGBT humanist Christopher Ward, who claimed that the post

185
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:27,740
was factually incorrect and not worthy of debate. It's fact, so it's factually incorrect

186
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:35,800
that women, that women don't have penises. Okay. I mean, that's one thing, but it's not

187
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:46,060
worthy of debate. So you can't debate whether or not women have penises. I don't know if

188
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:52,380
there's anything more to say beyond this guys. He wrote, as a former chair of LGBT humanist

189
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:57,100
UK, the opposition I experienced from a number of longstanding humanist members to trans

190
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:01,820
people and trans issues was a stain on an otherwise great organization. And here's the

191
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:09,120
new president of humanist students RT-ing horrific transphobic shit. It's, it's not,

192
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,660
it's not even horrific. It's not horrific. Maybe they've watched too much Bible black

193
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,520
or something. I don't fucking know. And of course he's right. He says, he says on Chronicle

194
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,920
live, what I said was a biological fact. We've reached a weird era where we are sacking people

195
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,920
for stating facts. Even if this is an opinion, people shouldn't be sacked for having it.

196
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,000
We should be having healthy discussions instead of silencing people. It seems like we're taking

197
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,180
steps backward. Exactly that this, this, this quotation from the guy, this is exactly what

198
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:45,720
basically this entire video has been about everything that there's the thesis. All right.

199
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:52,680
I'm just glad I'm a, I'm not in school anymore. But I'll be streaming on this channel on the

200
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,780
YouTube channel for once, not the Twitch. I'll be doing the monthly community stream

201
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:03,540
tonight and we're probably going to be watching, um, uh, the third, that guy with the glasses

202
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,580
movie suburban nights and taking a big old shit on it. So if you want to, uh, want to

203
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:14,620
come by and say hi, um, drop in, it'll probably be like 7 PM or 8 PM EST. I'll see you then

204
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,740
guys. I love you.
