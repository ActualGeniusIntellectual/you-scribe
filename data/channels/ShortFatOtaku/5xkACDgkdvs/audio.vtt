Hello everyone and welcome to This Week in Stupid for the 30th of September 2018, because

00:04.680 --> 00:10.160
I will no longer be producing This Week in Stupid, Dev from Shofar Taku, will be uploading

00:10.160 --> 00:16.400
content to my main channel. I'm tired though, you know? I'm tired.

00:16.400 --> 00:21.400
Thank you very much, Sargon. Rest assured that while you're sleeping off your low dopamine

00:21.400 --> 00:26.580
levels, This Week in Stupid is in good hands. And just so I don't break tradition, today

00:26.580 --> 00:33.300
I have vanilla hazelnut coffee, and man, is it tasty.

00:33.300 --> 00:40.000
And the subject of this week's episode is university stupidity, so let's jump right

00:40.000 --> 00:47.460
into it. A mathematician says activists made his paper disappear because its findings offended

00:47.460 --> 00:52.560
them. At behest of a feminist professor, an academic journal's board reportedly threatened

00:52.560 --> 00:57.820
to harass the journal until it died. Theodore Hill, a retired professor of mathematics at

00:57.820 --> 01:03.280
Georgia Tech, claims that activists successfully pressured the New York Journal of Mathematics

01:03.280 --> 01:07.240
to delete an article he had written for the academic journal because it considered a politically

01:07.240 --> 01:12.760
incorrect subject, the achievement gap between men and women at very high levels of human

01:12.760 --> 01:20.520
intelligence. See, it doesn't even say what stance this professor took on this subject,

01:20.520 --> 01:25.920
it's that he was considering it. If you consider it now, you have to be banned, you have to

01:25.920 --> 01:30.860
be censored, you have to be thrown out, your journal has to be harassed until it dies.

01:30.860 --> 01:36.200
The greater male variability hypothesis, first proposed by Charles Darwin, suggests that

01:36.200 --> 01:40.380
there are more men than women at both the bottom and the very top of the distribution

01:40.380 --> 01:45.440
for intelligence scores. More men than women are Nobel Prize winners and chess grand champions,

01:45.440 --> 01:51.600
and more men than women are homeless, unemployed, and in prison. Men as a group express greater

01:51.600 --> 01:57.800
variability in aptitude and ability. This difference, of course, need not be innate.

01:57.800 --> 02:02.880
It could be the case that social custom and pressure... hold on a second guys, it's my

02:02.880 --> 02:15.400
girlfriend... hey! What do you want? I'm currently live and the phone's right up against the

02:15.400 --> 02:23.960
mic, say hello! Hi guys, I didn't know you were live. Okay, what's going on? Nope, nevermind,

02:23.960 --> 02:30.560
not an important question at all, just leave. Bye. You're worse than V! I'm gonna get in

02:30.560 --> 02:35.400
shit for that later. So the whole point of the greater male variability hypothesis is

02:35.400 --> 02:42.400
basically that because men are more biologically disposable than women are, nature kind of

02:42.400 --> 02:47.400
has more free rein to tinker with them and to see what works and what doesn't in terms

02:47.400 --> 02:54.720
of random mutations. And this is obvious because, you know, in order to secure reproduction,

02:54.720 --> 03:01.520
men have to have sex for like, at the very least, the absolute minimum, a couple of minutes,

03:01.520 --> 03:06.760
meanwhile women have to carry the child for nine months. So biologically speaking, men

03:06.760 --> 03:11.480
are just not as valuable. Socially speaking, of course, we can have a completely different

03:11.480 --> 03:17.940
conversation there, but biologically speaking, that is just the way it is. So, if random

03:17.940 --> 03:21.680
mutations have to happen, it's better overall for them to happen in the males of a species

03:21.680 --> 03:27.720
than in the females. Which I think makes sense, because, you know, one woman who gets knocked

03:27.720 --> 03:33.880
out of the game, that's a far bigger hit to a population biologically than one man that

03:33.880 --> 03:38.760
gets knocked out of the game. So, nature will tinker around with random mutations in men,

03:38.760 --> 03:42.880
sometimes they're bad and they become fucking losers, sometimes they're good and they become

03:42.880 --> 03:48.000
gifted geniuses or something. Hill says that he and a co-author came up with a theoretical

03:48.000 --> 03:52.880
model that would help explain the gap, then attempted to publish a paper about their work

03:52.880 --> 03:59.720
in Mathematical Intelligencer. The paper was accepted, though the topic is controversial.

03:59.720 --> 04:04.400
Larry Summers resigned as president of Harvard University, in part due to criticism he received

04:04.400 --> 04:09.000
for broaching the subject of variability at an academic conference. This subject of variability

04:09.000 --> 04:18.400
is one, the truth, and two, it's a political minefield right now, because people just don't

04:18.400 --> 04:23.740
want to hear that maybe there's a biological component to some things. Now you're being

04:23.740 --> 04:28.720
a biological essentialist or something ridiculous like that. As might have been anticipated,

04:28.720 --> 04:38.160
the paper was poorly received by feminist scholars. Hill's co-author, Sergei Tabachatkinov,

04:38.160 --> 04:43.040
faced strident opposition at Penn State, where he is employed as a professor of mathematics.

04:43.040 --> 04:47.840
According to Hill, at a faculty meeting the week before, the department head had explained

04:47.840 --> 04:52.740
that sometimes values such as academic freedom and free speech come into conflict with other

04:52.740 --> 04:58.820
values to which Penn State was committed. Well guess what? When that conflict happens,

04:58.820 --> 05:04.540
academic freedom and free speech should win. A female colleague had then instructed Sergei

05:04.540 --> 05:10.120
that he needed to admit and fight bias, adding that the belief that women have a lesser chance

05:10.120 --> 05:16.300
to succeed in mathematics at the very top end is bias. Sergei had said that he had spent

05:16.300 --> 05:21.340
endless hours talking to people who explained that the paper was bad and harmful, and tried

05:21.340 --> 05:26.200
to convince him to withdraw my name to restore peace at the department and to avoid losing

05:26.200 --> 05:31.980
whatever political capital I may still have. This is just basically the SJWs, the feminists,

05:31.980 --> 05:36.540
the postmodernists trying to bully him into capitulation, saying no, it doesn't matter

05:36.540 --> 05:42.140
what your research says, this is a political decision and you have to abide by it. The

05:42.140 --> 05:47.220
National Science Foundation eventually wrote to him, asking that he remove from the paper

05:47.220 --> 05:51.780
any acknowledgement that the NSF had helped to fund the research. This was done, according

05:51.780 --> 05:57.480
to Hill, after two Penn State academics, the chair of the Climate and Diversity Committee

05:57.480 --> 06:03.060
and the associate head for diversity and equity, had warned the NSF that the paper promotes

06:03.060 --> 06:07.940
ideas detrimental to the advancement of women in science and at odds with the values of

06:07.940 --> 06:14.140
the NSF. And also the truth. I mean, this is where it gets particularly ridiculous.

06:14.140 --> 06:19.020
You see SJWs in video games, like with the gamergate, or you see Comixgate, or something

06:19.020 --> 06:25.780
like that, and those things are obviously bad, but it's like, I mean, I hate to really

06:25.780 --> 06:31.860
bring this up, but it really is just entertainment, right? Like, obviously I don't want this to

06:31.860 --> 06:37.720
happen here, but it's not super, super important, but when it happens to suppress legitimate

06:37.720 --> 06:46.180
studies, studies with a factual backing, studies with some real meat and potatoes behind them,

06:46.180 --> 06:52.240
this is extremely dangerous because now they're saying that their ideology has to take precedent

06:52.240 --> 06:58.880
over reality itself. Mathematical intelligence rescinded its acceptance of the paper. According

06:58.880 --> 07:05.240
to its editor in chief, publishing Hill and Russian's work would create a very real possibility

07:05.240 --> 07:09.520
that the right wing media may pick this up and hype it internationally. Well, guess what?

07:09.520 --> 07:14.420
The Streisand effect kicked in, and now people know about this, you idiots. Moreover, it's

07:14.420 --> 07:18.160
not saying that women can't compete at a high level. It's saying that they're less likely

07:18.160 --> 07:24.100
to be able to do so due to all of these factors. There are still exceptional women. Oh, fuck's

07:24.100 --> 07:28.960
it. Okay. In this Colette piece, Hill claims that a University of Chicago mathematics professor

07:28.960 --> 07:35.080
Amy Wilkinson lobbied the journal to abandon its plans to publish the piece. Sometime later,

07:35.080 --> 07:40.120
an editor at another publication, the New York Journal of Mathematics, wrote to Hill

07:40.120 --> 07:45.400
and offered to publish the paper. Hill accepted, and the article was published. But then, three

07:45.400 --> 07:51.200
days later, the paper had vanished. And a few days after that, a completely different

07:51.200 --> 07:58.440
paper by different authors appeared at exactly the same page of the same volume, volume 23,

07:58.440 --> 08:07.240
page 1641, where mine had once been. As it turns out, Amy Wilkinson is married to Benson

08:07.240 --> 08:13.400
Farb, a member of the NYJM editorial board. Upon discovering that the journal had published

08:13.400 --> 08:20.960
my paper, Professor Barb had written a furious email to the NYJM editor-in-chief Mark Steinenberger

08:20.960 --> 08:26.860
demanding that it be deleted at once. Unaware of any of this, I wrote to Steinberger on

08:26.860 --> 08:31.700
November 14th to find out what had happened. I pointed out that if the deletion were permanent,

08:31.700 --> 08:35.900
it would leave me in an impossible position. I would not be able to republish anywhere

08:35.900 --> 08:39.520
else, because I would be unable to sign a copyright form declaring that it had not been

08:39.520 --> 08:45.260
already published elsewhere. Steinberger replied later that day. Half his board, he explained

08:45.260 --> 08:51.220
unhappily, had told him that unless he pulled the article, they would all resign and harass

08:51.220 --> 08:56.820
the journal he had founded 25 years earlier until it died. Faced with the loss of his

08:56.820 --> 09:02.980
own scientific legacy, he had capitulated. A publication in a dead journal, he offered,

09:02.980 --> 09:07.000
wouldn't help you. This is how far these people are willing to go. They will worm their way

09:07.000 --> 09:12.120
into any institution. They will put themselves on any board. As soon as they have a foot

09:12.120 --> 09:17.260
in the door, they will start bringing in other people who will push their own ideology. And

09:17.260 --> 09:22.820
then as soon as they hit critical mass, as soon as the scale tips, they start censoring

09:22.820 --> 09:27.200
everything they don't like. And the media is complicit in this too, because as we all

09:27.200 --> 09:34.240
know, math is racist. How data is driving inequality on CNN tech of all places. It's

09:34.240 --> 09:39.340
no surprise that inequality in the US is on the rise, but what you might not know is that

09:39.340 --> 09:46.220
math is partly to blame. In a new book, Weapons of Math Destruction, Kathy O'Neill details

09:46.220 --> 09:51.580
all the ways that math is essentially being used for evil. My word, not hers. Well, at

09:51.580 --> 09:56.720
least we know who the idiot is then. From targeted advertising and insurance to education

09:56.720 --> 10:02.420
and policing, O'Neill looks at how algorithms and big data are targeting the poor, reinforcing

10:02.420 --> 10:09.120
racism, and amplifying inequality. These WMDs, as she calls them, have three key features.

10:09.120 --> 10:15.340
They are opaque, scalable, and unfair. Denied a job because of a personality test? Too bad.

10:15.340 --> 10:20.780
The algorithm said you wouldn't be a good fit. Charged a higher rate for a loan? Well,

10:20.780 --> 10:26.220
people in your zip code tend to be riskier borrowers. Received a harsher prison sentence?

10:26.220 --> 10:30.840
Here's the thing, your friends and family have criminal records too, so you're likely

10:30.840 --> 10:34.780
to be a repeat offender. Spoiler alert, the people on the receiving end of these messages

10:34.780 --> 10:39.720
don't actually get the explanation. Here's the interesting thing. One, all this data

10:39.720 --> 10:46.880
collection, it's happening by Facebook and by Google and by Twitter and by all of these

10:46.880 --> 10:54.120
big tech companies that also likes to suppress conservatives and is run entirely by leftist

10:54.120 --> 11:00.820
people. Two, all of these situations that you're talking about, the personality tests,

11:00.820 --> 11:06.300
it's grouping you in as an individual into a group of people with a similar personality.

11:06.300 --> 11:10.420
The zip code example, you're being grouped into people that you live near. The prison

11:10.420 --> 11:14.780
sentence example, you're being grouped in with your friends and family. These are all

11:14.780 --> 11:19.940
collectivist judgments, not individualist judgments, and that's kind of the problem.

11:19.940 --> 11:24.420
That's why whenever an SJW talks about collectivism, because they're racial activists or they're

11:24.420 --> 11:28.480
gender activists or something, this is the kind of stuff they're ushering in. They're

11:28.480 --> 11:33.760
saying it's okay to judge people based on group characteristics rather than assuming

11:33.760 --> 11:40.120
the inherent supremacy of the individual. So now we can do shit like this. Okay. Okay.

11:40.120 --> 11:46.840
Okay. If we're going to say that you are a white male or you are a black female, then

11:46.840 --> 11:51.480
how come we can't say that, oh, you're part of this neighborhood. Oh, you're part of this

11:51.480 --> 11:58.480
family. Oh, you're, you're part of this socioeconomic group and just judge you like that. That is

11:58.520 --> 12:04.880
what SJWs have brought back from the fucking dark ages of the pre 1960s. Of course, when

12:04.880 --> 12:10.400
data is used by the left, everything's fine. But when it's used by other people, it's suddenly

12:10.400 --> 12:17.400
white privilege because the democratic rep said, citing uncomfortable data is white privilege.

12:18.560 --> 12:23.600
Republican Iowa representative Steve King found himself accused of using his white privilege

12:23.640 --> 12:30.640
last week after he offered statistics that democratic Louisiana rep Cedric Richmond didn't

12:30.680 --> 12:34.440
like. It all started at a house judiciary committee hearing where King brought up the

12:34.440 --> 12:39.500
high crime rates of Central American nations that many immigrants hail from. King called

12:39.500 --> 12:44.680
the violence of countries like El Salvador shocking, but then pointed out that some cities

12:44.680 --> 12:50.300
in the US have comparable murder rates. And that talk infuriated representative Richmond

12:50.300 --> 12:54.460
who represents parts of New Orleans, one of the cities that he mentioned, we just had

12:54.460 --> 12:57.780
a conversation about this. We're going to lose all civility in this community. If he

12:57.780 --> 13:02.220
thinks it's appropriate to compare New Orleans to Guatemala, Richmond fumed while incorrectly

13:02.220 --> 13:08.140
identifying the nation King was speaking of. Oops. The committee chairman, Republican Virginia

13:08.140 --> 13:13.300
representative Bob Goodlatte tried to calm down the situation by pointing out the obvious.

13:13.300 --> 13:18.080
The gentleman from Iowa has the right to make a statistical comparison between two locations,

13:18.080 --> 13:22.120
but that only made the congressional black caucus member get even angrier and bring up

13:22.120 --> 13:27.200
the inevitable KKK comparison. You are comparing the people in the location. That would be

13:27.200 --> 13:32.500
like me comparing him to somebody in the Klan. I don't have the basis to do that. Richmond

13:32.500 --> 13:36.600
retorted to Goodlatte before humble bragging what how civil and bipartisan he is. Okay,

13:36.600 --> 13:43.220
I have a feeling that this article might not be completely unbiased. But he said, it's

13:43.220 --> 13:46.880
not appropriate. It's insensitive. And it's nothing more than a traditional white privilege

13:46.880 --> 13:52.000
of let me criticize a minority city. I take it how you want. I'm telling you how I feel.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.800
That's kind of the problem of putting all your chips on collectivism, isn't it? If you

13:55.800 --> 14:01.560
identify as some stripe of racial collectivist, whether it be like a white supremacist, or

14:01.560 --> 14:07.520
a Black Lives Matter person or whatever, then other people can just simply judge you based

14:07.520 --> 14:13.400
on the statistical truths of your group. I mean, if you don't want to be judged as individual

14:13.400 --> 14:19.880
Cedric Richmond, but rather as a part of a black community, well, then we can judge

14:19.880 --> 14:25.080
you by the actions of that black community. I don't think you want that, do you? I don't

14:25.080 --> 14:29.120
think you want to have all the crimes of the black community pinned on your shoulders,

14:29.120 --> 14:33.560
do you? And this is the ultimate problem with collectivism, because it makes all of that

14:33.560 --> 14:39.820
data from from the previous article relevant, frankly. And this applies to both collectivism

14:39.820 --> 14:46.900
on the left and collectivism on the right. It really seems to be right now the centrists

14:46.900 --> 14:50.880
that are the only group that promotes actual individualism that says no, you can't judge

14:50.880 --> 14:57.000
people because of their race, or their sex, or their economic status, or where they live

14:57.000 --> 15:02.560
or any of that nonsense, you just judge them as individuals, and make individual judgments

15:02.560 --> 15:06.860
as you meet them. That seems to be the only way forward. Because things aren't getting

15:06.860 --> 15:11.780
better. They're getting worse. And right now, SJWs are to blame. They're not the only

15:11.780 --> 15:15.720
collectivists that exist in the world, but they're certainly the ones with the most power

15:15.720 --> 15:21.680
right now. And finally, we get to peak university stupidity with student editor who retweeted

15:21.680 --> 15:29.020
article pointing out that women don't have penises is fired from University Journal.

15:29.020 --> 15:40.120
A student editor at a top university has been fired in a transphobia row after he tweeted

15:40.120 --> 15:48.220
that women don't have penises. Remember when I said that ideology has to take precedence

15:48.220 --> 15:54.200
over reality? Angelos Sophakalos, I don't fucking know. Angelos, assistant editor at

15:54.200 --> 15:59.620
Durham University's philosophy journal Critique, was sacked from his post after just three

15:59.620 --> 16:07.100
days for writing a tweet deemed transphobic by fellow students. He's 24, he's from Cyprus.

16:07.100 --> 16:12.080
He faces disciplinary action last month after he retweeted an article by The Spectator on

16:12.080 --> 16:18.960
his Twitter titled, is it a crime to say women don't have penises? With the comment, RT,

16:18.960 --> 16:24.820
if women don't have penises. He's technically not even saying here that he thinks women

16:24.820 --> 16:32.300
don't have penises. He's simply saying that, is it a crime to say so? And asking his followers

16:32.300 --> 16:37.760
if they think so or not, asking for RTs if they do, retweets. The postgraduate philosophy

16:37.760 --> 16:41.580
and psychology student was dismissed from his position at the university after the tweet

16:41.580 --> 16:46.400
sparked outrage. He was also fired from his position as editor of Durham University's

16:46.400 --> 16:51.440
online magazine, The Bubble, and forced to resign as president of Free Speech Society

16:51.440 --> 16:59.100
Humanist Students. Oh, oh, really? So he has to resign from the Free Speech Society over

16:59.100 --> 17:04.520
speech? Wait, wait, wait, wait. He didn't even tweet it. So he did actually take a stand

17:04.520 --> 17:09.620
on whether or not women have penises, but he didn't even tweet anything. He simply retweeted

17:09.620 --> 17:15.140
somebody else's tweet. He was fired for a retweet. The since deleted tweet has received

17:15.140 --> 17:20.120
backlash from former chair of LGBT humanist Christopher Ward, who claimed that the post

17:20.120 --> 17:27.740
was factually incorrect and not worthy of debate. It's fact, so it's factually incorrect

17:27.740 --> 17:35.800
that women, that women don't have penises. Okay. I mean, that's one thing, but it's not

17:35.800 --> 17:46.060
worthy of debate. So you can't debate whether or not women have penises. I don't know if

17:46.060 --> 17:52.380
there's anything more to say beyond this guys. He wrote, as a former chair of LGBT humanist

17:52.380 --> 17:57.100
UK, the opposition I experienced from a number of longstanding humanist members to trans

17:57.100 --> 18:01.820
people and trans issues was a stain on an otherwise great organization. And here's the

18:01.820 --> 18:09.120
new president of humanist students RT-ing horrific transphobic shit. It's, it's not,

18:09.120 --> 18:14.660
it's not even horrific. It's not horrific. Maybe they've watched too much Bible black

18:14.660 --> 18:19.520
or something. I don't fucking know. And of course he's right. He says, he says on Chronicle

18:19.520 --> 18:24.920
live, what I said was a biological fact. We've reached a weird era where we are sacking people

18:24.920 --> 18:29.920
for stating facts. Even if this is an opinion, people shouldn't be sacked for having it.

18:29.920 --> 18:33.000
We should be having healthy discussions instead of silencing people. It seems like we're taking

18:33.000 --> 18:40.180
steps backward. Exactly that this, this, this quotation from the guy, this is exactly what

18:40.180 --> 18:45.720
basically this entire video has been about everything that there's the thesis. All right.

18:45.720 --> 18:52.680
I'm just glad I'm a, I'm not in school anymore. But I'll be streaming on this channel on the

18:52.680 --> 18:56.780
YouTube channel for once, not the Twitch. I'll be doing the monthly community stream

18:56.780 --> 19:03.540
tonight and we're probably going to be watching, um, uh, the third, that guy with the glasses

19:03.540 --> 19:07.580
movie suburban nights and taking a big old shit on it. So if you want to, uh, want to

19:07.580 --> 19:14.620
come by and say hi, um, drop in, it'll probably be like 7 PM or 8 PM EST. I'll see you then

19:14.620 --> 19:15.740
guys. I love you.
