0	4680	Hello everyone and welcome to This Week in Stupid for the 30th of September 2018, because
4680	10160	I will no longer be producing This Week in Stupid, Dev from Shofar Taku, will be uploading
10160	16400	content to my main channel. I'm tired though, you know? I'm tired.
16400	21400	Thank you very much, Sargon. Rest assured that while you're sleeping off your low dopamine
21400	26580	levels, This Week in Stupid is in good hands. And just so I don't break tradition, today
26580	33300	I have vanilla hazelnut coffee, and man, is it tasty.
33300	40000	And the subject of this week's episode is university stupidity, so let's jump right
40000	47460	into it. A mathematician says activists made his paper disappear because its findings offended
47460	52560	them. At behest of a feminist professor, an academic journal's board reportedly threatened
52560	57820	to harass the journal until it died. Theodore Hill, a retired professor of mathematics at
57820	63280	Georgia Tech, claims that activists successfully pressured the New York Journal of Mathematics
63280	67240	to delete an article he had written for the academic journal because it considered a politically
67240	72760	incorrect subject, the achievement gap between men and women at very high levels of human
72760	80520	intelligence. See, it doesn't even say what stance this professor took on this subject,
80520	85920	it's that he was considering it. If you consider it now, you have to be banned, you have to
85920	90860	be censored, you have to be thrown out, your journal has to be harassed until it dies.
90860	96200	The greater male variability hypothesis, first proposed by Charles Darwin, suggests that
96200	100380	there are more men than women at both the bottom and the very top of the distribution
100380	105440	for intelligence scores. More men than women are Nobel Prize winners and chess grand champions,
105440	111600	and more men than women are homeless, unemployed, and in prison. Men as a group express greater
111600	117800	variability in aptitude and ability. This difference, of course, need not be innate.
117800	122880	It could be the case that social custom and pressure... hold on a second guys, it's my
122880	135400	girlfriend... hey! What do you want? I'm currently live and the phone's right up against the
135400	143960	mic, say hello! Hi guys, I didn't know you were live. Okay, what's going on? Nope, nevermind,
143960	150560	not an important question at all, just leave. Bye. You're worse than V! I'm gonna get in
150560	155400	shit for that later. So the whole point of the greater male variability hypothesis is
155400	162400	basically that because men are more biologically disposable than women are, nature kind of
162400	167400	has more free rein to tinker with them and to see what works and what doesn't in terms
167400	174720	of random mutations. And this is obvious because, you know, in order to secure reproduction,
174720	181520	men have to have sex for like, at the very least, the absolute minimum, a couple of minutes,
181520	186760	meanwhile women have to carry the child for nine months. So biologically speaking, men
186760	191480	are just not as valuable. Socially speaking, of course, we can have a completely different
191480	197940	conversation there, but biologically speaking, that is just the way it is. So, if random
197940	201680	mutations have to happen, it's better overall for them to happen in the males of a species
201680	207720	than in the females. Which I think makes sense, because, you know, one woman who gets knocked
207720	213880	out of the game, that's a far bigger hit to a population biologically than one man that
213880	218760	gets knocked out of the game. So, nature will tinker around with random mutations in men,
218760	222880	sometimes they're bad and they become fucking losers, sometimes they're good and they become
222880	228000	gifted geniuses or something. Hill says that he and a co-author came up with a theoretical
228000	232880	model that would help explain the gap, then attempted to publish a paper about their work
232880	239720	in Mathematical Intelligencer. The paper was accepted, though the topic is controversial.
239720	244400	Larry Summers resigned as president of Harvard University, in part due to criticism he received
244400	249000	for broaching the subject of variability at an academic conference. This subject of variability
249000	258400	is one, the truth, and two, it's a political minefield right now, because people just don't
258400	263740	want to hear that maybe there's a biological component to some things. Now you're being
263740	268720	a biological essentialist or something ridiculous like that. As might have been anticipated,
268720	278160	the paper was poorly received by feminist scholars. Hill's co-author, Sergei Tabachatkinov,
278160	283040	faced strident opposition at Penn State, where he is employed as a professor of mathematics.
283040	287840	According to Hill, at a faculty meeting the week before, the department head had explained
287840	292740	that sometimes values such as academic freedom and free speech come into conflict with other
292740	298820	values to which Penn State was committed. Well guess what? When that conflict happens,
298820	304540	academic freedom and free speech should win. A female colleague had then instructed Sergei
304540	310120	that he needed to admit and fight bias, adding that the belief that women have a lesser chance
310120	316300	to succeed in mathematics at the very top end is bias. Sergei had said that he had spent
316300	321340	endless hours talking to people who explained that the paper was bad and harmful, and tried
321340	326200	to convince him to withdraw my name to restore peace at the department and to avoid losing
326200	331980	whatever political capital I may still have. This is just basically the SJWs, the feminists,
331980	336540	the postmodernists trying to bully him into capitulation, saying no, it doesn't matter
336540	342140	what your research says, this is a political decision and you have to abide by it. The
342140	347220	National Science Foundation eventually wrote to him, asking that he remove from the paper
347220	351780	any acknowledgement that the NSF had helped to fund the research. This was done, according
351780	357480	to Hill, after two Penn State academics, the chair of the Climate and Diversity Committee
357480	363060	and the associate head for diversity and equity, had warned the NSF that the paper promotes
363060	367940	ideas detrimental to the advancement of women in science and at odds with the values of
367940	374140	the NSF. And also the truth. I mean, this is where it gets particularly ridiculous.
374140	379020	You see SJWs in video games, like with the gamergate, or you see Comixgate, or something
379020	385780	like that, and those things are obviously bad, but it's like, I mean, I hate to really
385780	391860	bring this up, but it really is just entertainment, right? Like, obviously I don't want this to
391860	397720	happen here, but it's not super, super important, but when it happens to suppress legitimate
397720	406180	studies, studies with a factual backing, studies with some real meat and potatoes behind them,
406180	412240	this is extremely dangerous because now they're saying that their ideology has to take precedent
412240	418880	over reality itself. Mathematical intelligence rescinded its acceptance of the paper. According
418880	425240	to its editor in chief, publishing Hill and Russian's work would create a very real possibility
425240	429520	that the right wing media may pick this up and hype it internationally. Well, guess what?
429520	434420	The Streisand effect kicked in, and now people know about this, you idiots. Moreover, it's
434420	438160	not saying that women can't compete at a high level. It's saying that they're less likely
438160	444100	to be able to do so due to all of these factors. There are still exceptional women. Oh, fuck's
444100	448960	it. Okay. In this Colette piece, Hill claims that a University of Chicago mathematics professor
448960	455080	Amy Wilkinson lobbied the journal to abandon its plans to publish the piece. Sometime later,
455080	460120	an editor at another publication, the New York Journal of Mathematics, wrote to Hill
460120	465400	and offered to publish the paper. Hill accepted, and the article was published. But then, three
465400	471200	days later, the paper had vanished. And a few days after that, a completely different
471200	478440	paper by different authors appeared at exactly the same page of the same volume, volume 23,
478440	487240	page 1641, where mine had once been. As it turns out, Amy Wilkinson is married to Benson
487240	493400	Farb, a member of the NYJM editorial board. Upon discovering that the journal had published
493400	500960	my paper, Professor Barb had written a furious email to the NYJM editor-in-chief Mark Steinenberger
500960	506860	demanding that it be deleted at once. Unaware of any of this, I wrote to Steinberger on
506860	511700	November 14th to find out what had happened. I pointed out that if the deletion were permanent,
511700	515900	it would leave me in an impossible position. I would not be able to republish anywhere
515900	519520	else, because I would be unable to sign a copyright form declaring that it had not been
519520	525260	already published elsewhere. Steinberger replied later that day. Half his board, he explained
525260	531220	unhappily, had told him that unless he pulled the article, they would all resign and harass
531220	536820	the journal he had founded 25 years earlier until it died. Faced with the loss of his
536820	542980	own scientific legacy, he had capitulated. A publication in a dead journal, he offered,
542980	547000	wouldn't help you. This is how far these people are willing to go. They will worm their way
547000	552120	into any institution. They will put themselves on any board. As soon as they have a foot
552120	557260	in the door, they will start bringing in other people who will push their own ideology. And
557260	562820	then as soon as they hit critical mass, as soon as the scale tips, they start censoring
562820	567200	everything they don't like. And the media is complicit in this too, because as we all
567200	574240	know, math is racist. How data is driving inequality on CNN tech of all places. It's
574240	579340	no surprise that inequality in the US is on the rise, but what you might not know is that
579340	586220	math is partly to blame. In a new book, Weapons of Math Destruction, Kathy O'Neill details
586220	591580	all the ways that math is essentially being used for evil. My word, not hers. Well, at
591580	596720	least we know who the idiot is then. From targeted advertising and insurance to education
596720	602420	and policing, O'Neill looks at how algorithms and big data are targeting the poor, reinforcing
602420	609120	racism, and amplifying inequality. These WMDs, as she calls them, have three key features.
609120	615340	They are opaque, scalable, and unfair. Denied a job because of a personality test? Too bad.
615340	620780	The algorithm said you wouldn't be a good fit. Charged a higher rate for a loan? Well,
620780	626220	people in your zip code tend to be riskier borrowers. Received a harsher prison sentence?
626220	630840	Here's the thing, your friends and family have criminal records too, so you're likely
630840	634780	to be a repeat offender. Spoiler alert, the people on the receiving end of these messages
634780	639720	don't actually get the explanation. Here's the interesting thing. One, all this data
639720	646880	collection, it's happening by Facebook and by Google and by Twitter and by all of these
646880	654120	big tech companies that also likes to suppress conservatives and is run entirely by leftist
654120	660820	people. Two, all of these situations that you're talking about, the personality tests,
660820	666300	it's grouping you in as an individual into a group of people with a similar personality.
666300	670420	The zip code example, you're being grouped into people that you live near. The prison
670420	674780	sentence example, you're being grouped in with your friends and family. These are all
674780	679940	collectivist judgments, not individualist judgments, and that's kind of the problem.
679940	684420	That's why whenever an SJW talks about collectivism, because they're racial activists or they're
684420	688480	gender activists or something, this is the kind of stuff they're ushering in. They're
688480	693760	saying it's okay to judge people based on group characteristics rather than assuming
693760	700120	the inherent supremacy of the individual. So now we can do shit like this. Okay. Okay.
700120	706840	Okay. If we're going to say that you are a white male or you are a black female, then
706840	711480	how come we can't say that, oh, you're part of this neighborhood. Oh, you're part of this
711480	718480	family. Oh, you're, you're part of this socioeconomic group and just judge you like that. That is
718520	724880	what SJWs have brought back from the fucking dark ages of the pre 1960s. Of course, when
724880	730400	data is used by the left, everything's fine. But when it's used by other people, it's suddenly
730400	737400	white privilege because the democratic rep said, citing uncomfortable data is white privilege.
738560	743600	Republican Iowa representative Steve King found himself accused of using his white privilege
743640	750640	last week after he offered statistics that democratic Louisiana rep Cedric Richmond didn't
750680	754440	like. It all started at a house judiciary committee hearing where King brought up the
754440	759500	high crime rates of Central American nations that many immigrants hail from. King called
759500	764680	the violence of countries like El Salvador shocking, but then pointed out that some cities
764680	770300	in the US have comparable murder rates. And that talk infuriated representative Richmond
770300	774460	who represents parts of New Orleans, one of the cities that he mentioned, we just had
774460	777780	a conversation about this. We're going to lose all civility in this community. If he
777780	782220	thinks it's appropriate to compare New Orleans to Guatemala, Richmond fumed while incorrectly
782220	788140	identifying the nation King was speaking of. Oops. The committee chairman, Republican Virginia
788140	793300	representative Bob Goodlatte tried to calm down the situation by pointing out the obvious.
793300	798080	The gentleman from Iowa has the right to make a statistical comparison between two locations,
798080	802120	but that only made the congressional black caucus member get even angrier and bring up
802120	807200	the inevitable KKK comparison. You are comparing the people in the location. That would be
807200	812500	like me comparing him to somebody in the Klan. I don't have the basis to do that. Richmond
812500	816600	retorted to Goodlatte before humble bragging what how civil and bipartisan he is. Okay,
816600	823220	I have a feeling that this article might not be completely unbiased. But he said, it's
823220	826880	not appropriate. It's insensitive. And it's nothing more than a traditional white privilege
826880	832000	of let me criticize a minority city. I take it how you want. I'm telling you how I feel.
832000	835800	That's kind of the problem of putting all your chips on collectivism, isn't it? If you
835800	841560	identify as some stripe of racial collectivist, whether it be like a white supremacist, or
841560	847520	a Black Lives Matter person or whatever, then other people can just simply judge you based
847520	853400	on the statistical truths of your group. I mean, if you don't want to be judged as individual
853400	859880	Cedric Richmond, but rather as a part of a black community, well, then we can judge
859880	865080	you by the actions of that black community. I don't think you want that, do you? I don't
865080	869120	think you want to have all the crimes of the black community pinned on your shoulders,
869120	873560	do you? And this is the ultimate problem with collectivism, because it makes all of that
873560	879820	data from from the previous article relevant, frankly. And this applies to both collectivism
879820	886900	on the left and collectivism on the right. It really seems to be right now the centrists
886900	890880	that are the only group that promotes actual individualism that says no, you can't judge
890880	897000	people because of their race, or their sex, or their economic status, or where they live
897000	902560	or any of that nonsense, you just judge them as individuals, and make individual judgments
902560	906860	as you meet them. That seems to be the only way forward. Because things aren't getting
906860	911780	better. They're getting worse. And right now, SJWs are to blame. They're not the only
911780	915720	collectivists that exist in the world, but they're certainly the ones with the most power
915720	921680	right now. And finally, we get to peak university stupidity with student editor who retweeted
921680	929020	article pointing out that women don't have penises is fired from University Journal.
929020	940120	A student editor at a top university has been fired in a transphobia row after he tweeted
940120	948220	that women don't have penises. Remember when I said that ideology has to take precedence
948220	954200	over reality? Angelos Sophakalos, I don't fucking know. Angelos, assistant editor at
954200	959620	Durham University's philosophy journal Critique, was sacked from his post after just three
959620	967100	days for writing a tweet deemed transphobic by fellow students. He's 24, he's from Cyprus.
967100	972080	He faces disciplinary action last month after he retweeted an article by The Spectator on
972080	978960	his Twitter titled, is it a crime to say women don't have penises? With the comment, RT,
978960	984820	if women don't have penises. He's technically not even saying here that he thinks women
984820	992300	don't have penises. He's simply saying that, is it a crime to say so? And asking his followers
992300	997760	if they think so or not, asking for RTs if they do, retweets. The postgraduate philosophy
997760	1001580	and psychology student was dismissed from his position at the university after the tweet
1001580	1006400	sparked outrage. He was also fired from his position as editor of Durham University's
1006400	1011440	online magazine, The Bubble, and forced to resign as president of Free Speech Society
1011440	1019100	Humanist Students. Oh, oh, really? So he has to resign from the Free Speech Society over
1019100	1024520	speech? Wait, wait, wait, wait. He didn't even tweet it. So he did actually take a stand
1024520	1029620	on whether or not women have penises, but he didn't even tweet anything. He simply retweeted
1029620	1035140	somebody else's tweet. He was fired for a retweet. The since deleted tweet has received
1035140	1040120	backlash from former chair of LGBT humanist Christopher Ward, who claimed that the post
1040120	1047740	was factually incorrect and not worthy of debate. It's fact, so it's factually incorrect
1047740	1055800	that women, that women don't have penises. Okay. I mean, that's one thing, but it's not
1055800	1066060	worthy of debate. So you can't debate whether or not women have penises. I don't know if
1066060	1072380	there's anything more to say beyond this guys. He wrote, as a former chair of LGBT humanist
1072380	1077100	UK, the opposition I experienced from a number of longstanding humanist members to trans
1077100	1081820	people and trans issues was a stain on an otherwise great organization. And here's the
1081820	1089120	new president of humanist students RT-ing horrific transphobic shit. It's, it's not,
1089120	1094660	it's not even horrific. It's not horrific. Maybe they've watched too much Bible black
1094660	1099520	or something. I don't fucking know. And of course he's right. He says, he says on Chronicle
1099520	1104920	live, what I said was a biological fact. We've reached a weird era where we are sacking people
1104920	1109920	for stating facts. Even if this is an opinion, people shouldn't be sacked for having it.
1109920	1113000	We should be having healthy discussions instead of silencing people. It seems like we're taking
1113000	1120180	steps backward. Exactly that this, this, this quotation from the guy, this is exactly what
1120180	1125720	basically this entire video has been about everything that there's the thesis. All right.
1125720	1132680	I'm just glad I'm a, I'm not in school anymore. But I'll be streaming on this channel on the
1132680	1136780	YouTube channel for once, not the Twitch. I'll be doing the monthly community stream
1136780	1143540	tonight and we're probably going to be watching, um, uh, the third, that guy with the glasses
1143540	1147580	movie suburban nights and taking a big old shit on it. So if you want to, uh, want to
1147580	1154620	come by and say hi, um, drop in, it'll probably be like 7 PM or 8 PM EST. I'll see you then
1154620	1155740	guys. I love you.
