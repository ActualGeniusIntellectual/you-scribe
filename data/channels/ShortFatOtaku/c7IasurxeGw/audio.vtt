00:00.000 --> 00:05.840
This post is from the twitter account of Comedy Unleashed, London's free-thinking comedy club.

00:05.840 --> 00:10.640
No self-censorship. If it's funny, it's funny. Trying to make a joke that doesn't offend anyone

00:10.640 --> 00:16.000
in 2018. Well, 2019 might be just getting underway, but I have a feeling that sentiment

00:16.000 --> 00:20.400
hasn't really changed yet. I first came to know about Comedy Unleashed and its commitment to

00:20.400 --> 00:25.040
free speech within comedy when this behavioral agreement contract began floating around the

00:25.040 --> 00:29.920
internet. It's basically a form where comedians agree to not make fun of certain topics that

00:29.920 --> 00:34.880
social justice holds as sacred cows. This comedy night aims to provide a safe space for everyone

00:34.880 --> 00:39.680
to come together and share and listen to comedy, with all proceeds donated to UNICEF. This is a

00:39.680 --> 00:44.080
chance for all to be entertained and overjoyed by the different performances here on this day,

00:44.080 --> 00:49.920
the 23rd of January 2019, hence the importance of this contract. This contract has been written to

00:49.920 --> 00:55.200
ensure an environment where joy, love, and acceptance is reciprocated by all. By signing

00:55.200 --> 01:00.320
this contract, you are agreeing to our no tolerance policy with regards to racism, sexism,

01:00.320 --> 01:07.840
classism, ageism, ableism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, xenophobia, islamophobia, anti-religion,

01:07.840 --> 01:12.800
or anti-atheism. All topics must be presented in a way that is respectful and kind. It does not mean

01:12.800 --> 01:17.680
that these topics cannot be discussed, but it must be done in a respectful and non-abusive way. I can

01:17.680 --> 01:22.640
tell you right off the bat, just using the rules of comedy, why this is a disastrous line of thinking.

01:22.640 --> 01:27.680
All comedy, without exception, requires somebody or something to be the butt of the joke. Even the

01:27.680 --> 01:32.720
tamest, least offensive jokes require somebody to end up looking like they've got egg on their face.

01:32.720 --> 01:37.840
Here, let me show you. Here's a list of jokes for kids from redtricycle.com. Why did the student

01:37.840 --> 01:42.160
eat his homework? Because the teacher told him it was a piece of cake. The butt of the joke is the

01:42.160 --> 01:46.560
student that ate his homework. Or I guess the butt of the joke could be you, since you're the one

01:46.560 --> 01:51.920
probably groaning at that terrible pun. The point is though, in comedy, somebody's got to be left

01:51.920 --> 01:57.280
holding the bag. Somebody's the person getting laughed at. When you boil it down, there is no joke

01:57.280 --> 02:02.240
that isn't at the expense of somebody else. At least a little bit. Even when the joke is about an object,

02:02.240 --> 02:07.520
something like, say, an ugly looking car, for example, it still connects back to the car's owner

02:07.520 --> 02:12.000
and whatever tastes they may have. If the person that is the butt of the joke takes offense, and we

02:12.000 --> 02:17.200
use that as an excuse to call that form of comedy over the line, then we will not have any comedy at

02:17.200 --> 02:22.240
all. Especially with how easily triggered people seem to get nowadays. This contract is not, as it

02:22.240 --> 02:26.480
claims, a way to ensure that all are entertained and overjoyed by comedy, but rather that these

02:26.480 --> 02:31.280
topics are not made the butt of the joke. These are the sacred precepts that you must not violate.

02:31.280 --> 02:35.680
And just like a hypothetical variant of this contract from a decade ago may have only contained

02:35.680 --> 02:41.280
racism, sexism, and homophobia, next year's variant will probably tack on a few more isms and phobias,

02:41.280 --> 02:45.840
ever expanding the list of things you cannot joke about because they're just too serious.

02:45.840 --> 02:50.320
And any comedian worth their salt is taking notice of this encroachment into the comedic space.

02:50.320 --> 02:54.400
Konstantin Kissen, when presented with one of these contracts, refused to sign it and turned

02:54.400 --> 02:59.120
down being a part of the UNICEF event. He did post the contract to Comedy Unleashed on Twitter though,

02:59.120 --> 03:02.880
which triggered a relatively predictable backlash from the social justice crowd.

03:02.880 --> 03:07.840
If your jokes align with violence against marginalized folks, then they're not jokes.

03:07.840 --> 03:12.240
They're propaganda. We don't live in a hypersensitive world. People are finally being

03:12.240 --> 03:17.040
held accountable. Except that, when you really think about it, everybody's marginalized.

03:17.040 --> 03:21.840
Everybody's oppressed. Everybody's got some hidden burden they're carrying that you're not privy to,

03:21.840 --> 03:26.000
that maybe even their friends and family aren't privy to. And you're sitting here making these

03:26.000 --> 03:30.080
judgments based solely on what people present to the world. Maybe you're black. So okay,

03:30.080 --> 03:34.400
let's ban racism from comedy. We don't want you to feel uncomfortable. Maybe you're a woman.

03:34.400 --> 03:39.200
Okay, let's ban sexism. Maybe you're a rape victim. So let's ban rape jokes. Maybe you're

03:39.200 --> 03:44.400
a Muslim. So let's ban jokes about Islam. They're Islamophobic. Maybe you're trans. Let's ban jokes

03:44.400 --> 03:49.360
about trans people. They're transphobic. Maybe you're gay. Let's ban gay jokes since they're

03:49.360 --> 03:54.480
homophobic. But why not ban jokes about the family? Maybe somebody in the crowd was abused

03:54.480 --> 03:59.200
by their parents as a child and would be massively triggered by a joke about how the comedian's dad

03:59.200 --> 04:03.280
sucked sometimes. They would definitely be oppressed by it. So we have to ban family-based

04:03.280 --> 04:07.680
humor. How about we ban jokes about cars? Because maybe you lost your sister in a crash. How about

04:07.680 --> 04:12.320
we ban jokes about student loans? Because maybe you're poor and can't afford to send your kid to

04:12.320 --> 04:16.960
a good school. How about we ban jokes about video games? Because maybe as a kid you were relentlessly

04:16.960 --> 04:21.200
bullied and only took solace in retreating to your home and playing games after school.

04:21.200 --> 04:25.360
This is why when you remove the ability to have somebody be the butt of the joke,

04:25.360 --> 04:30.320
you destroy all of comedy. Because everybody is the butt of the joke, at least at some point in

04:30.320 --> 04:35.600
their lives. And everybody also carries some burden with them through life. If offense is

04:35.600 --> 04:40.720
enough to censor comedy, then comedy ceases to exist. I would hate to imagine one of these

04:40.720 --> 04:45.520
nightmarish social justice comedy sets. It would probably be less entertaining than the actual

04:45.520 --> 04:50.880
social justice classes held at the same university. But that is where we're going. And you can tell

04:50.880 --> 04:56.400
exactly how morally bankrupt a censor is based on what they come to the defense of in their censorship

04:56.400 --> 05:01.520
of comedy. Mumkey Jones, recently banned from YouTube permanently for his comedic videos where

05:01.520 --> 05:06.960
the butt of the joke was Elliot Rodger, tweeted that in 2017 he was banned for mocking Sharia law

05:06.960 --> 05:12.080
and in 2018 he was banned for mocking school shooters. Who will YouTube stand behind in 2019?

05:12.080 --> 05:16.080
My money is on pedophiles. No, that's Twitter dude. But I'll have to make another video for

05:16.080 --> 05:20.400
that. The point is, whenever some large tech company censors jokes about an edgy topic,

05:20.400 --> 05:24.880
they are coming to defense of that topic. I'm sure YouTube does not actually support Elliot

05:24.880 --> 05:29.760
Rodger, but in censoring jokes about him and his point of view, they are acting as if they do.

05:29.760 --> 05:34.240
On this topic, recently Louis CK decided to make his big comeback. I was never really a

05:34.240 --> 05:38.720
fan of him even before all of the Me Too shit happened. I just didn't find him funny. He seemed

05:38.720 --> 05:42.560
like he was trying to play to the progressive crowd a bit too much, presumably not fully

05:42.560 --> 05:46.560
understanding that eventually, once they were done with the free speech comedy extremists,

05:46.560 --> 05:50.480
they were going to come for him next. But apparently his return set was filled with edgy

05:50.480 --> 05:55.040
jokes, drawing the ire of the social justice crowd, who had hoped he would just vanish after

05:55.040 --> 06:00.000
his Me Too accusations, which really, to me, just sounded like Louis awkwardly asking women

06:00.000 --> 06:03.760
if they wanted to watch him jerk off. The woman declined, he didn't force the issue,

06:03.760 --> 06:07.840
and I don't personally consider requests for sexual contact to be themselves

06:07.840 --> 06:12.000
sexual assault, unless he persisted after being rejected, which I don't think he did.

06:25.040 --> 06:54.320
Louis CK marks Parkland

06:54.320 --> 06:58.160
Survivors an audio of stand up routine. Comedians said of teen activists,

06:58.160 --> 07:04.080
you're not interesting because you went to a high school where kids got shot. Well, he's not wrong.

07:04.080 --> 07:09.680
CK also mocked political correctness among young people and requests by gender non-binary people

07:09.680 --> 07:14.640
to be addressed by certain pronouns. He also discussed his own bad year, which was set in

07:14.640 --> 07:18.960
train after he admitted to allegations of sexual misconduct. He went on to say he was really

07:18.960 --> 07:23.280
disappointed in the younger generation, calling them boring, for objecting to what they consider

07:23.280 --> 07:27.760
offensive comments. The routine was panned on social media. It was panned on social media

07:27.760 --> 07:31.920
because the only social media accounts The Guardian ever pays attention to is the progressive

07:31.920 --> 07:36.240
social justice cucklord wing of social media. Here's the thing that I can't stop thinking

07:36.240 --> 07:40.880
about regarding Louis CK. Given the broader context of his behavior towards women, delivering

07:40.880 --> 07:45.280
a set about everyone being too sensitive these days feels like a sly way to say the same about

07:45.280 --> 07:50.960
women. No, Jessica Valenti, he made a joke at your expense. And you're protesting too much.

07:50.960 --> 07:56.000
The fact that Louis CK's anti-Asian jokes weren't originally reported speaks volumes

07:56.000 --> 08:01.680
to how casually Americans still treat anti-Asian racism. Oh, so apparently not only was Louis CK's

08:01.680 --> 08:05.600
set taken from the pages of the Satanic Bible itself, but the fact that the media didn't

08:05.600 --> 08:10.640
talk about his Asians have tiny dicks section is the real problem? You know what's the worst,

08:10.640 --> 08:15.360
most boring kind of comedy? The kind where old white men are angry that old white men

08:15.360 --> 08:19.280
can't do or say whatever the fuck they want anymore. You know what's actually the worst

08:19.280 --> 08:25.600
kind of comedy? The neutered, impotent, lacking a punch, social justice approved comedy. And you

08:25.600 --> 08:29.760
know what's the worst kind of comedian? The kind who are too scared to make jokes about anyone,

08:29.760 --> 08:34.320
so they cuck out to people like you and censor themselves and attempt to censor others. If your

08:34.320 --> 08:39.200
jokes are bad, people won't laugh. If your jokes are consistently bad, you'll find that your comedy

08:39.200 --> 08:44.240
career won't pay the bills. And that should be the only consequence of bad comedy, not fucking

08:44.240 --> 08:49.680
witch hunts. Louis CK's new set apparently has a section attacking non-binary people. He thinks

08:49.680 --> 08:54.720
it's wrong to use they as a singular pronoun. I, on the other hand, think it's wrong to sexually

08:54.720 --> 09:00.560
assault people. Now see, that's actually a funny joke and is at the expense of Louis CK, and more

09:00.560 --> 09:05.040
broadly the people who commit sexual assault. It's not necessarily an accurate joke because it's not

09:05.040 --> 09:09.600
clear if Louis CK actually did that, but let's put it aside for a bit. This is a funny joke from an

09:09.600 --> 09:15.840
SJW, at the expense of Louis CK. But because it trivializes sexual assault or whatever,

09:15.840 --> 09:20.720
expect this person to be similarly excommunicated from social justice. This is why progressives

09:20.720 --> 09:25.120
can't do comedy, and hell, why they can't meme. Because every time somebody's on the receiving

09:25.120 --> 09:30.080
end of a joke, somebody else is going to yank a reason out of their ass to call foul. Louis CK

09:30.080 --> 09:34.320
isn't being denied work because he tells stupid, unfunny jokes. He's being denied work because he's

09:34.320 --> 09:39.200
a serial workplace sexual predator. The only problem is, if there were no accusations against

09:39.200 --> 09:43.840
Louis CK, there would still be attempts to deplatform him based on this recent set.

09:43.840 --> 09:47.200
You may have a convenient excuse with him, but that doesn't mean it's the reason.

09:47.200 --> 09:51.280
Count Dankula has never had MeToo accusations hit him, and yet he's still one of the most

09:51.280 --> 09:56.560
maligned comedians to ever exist due to the whole Nazi pug thing. It is always about censoring

09:56.560 --> 10:01.360
speech. It just becomes a bit easier on the optics if the speaker has skeletons in his closet.

10:01.360 --> 10:05.600
I'm happy to throw in with the free speech extremist lot, but to me free speech is even

10:05.600 --> 10:10.240
more important when it comes to comedy. Think of it this way. Whenever a story wants to show

10:10.240 --> 10:14.720
a king to truly be a tyrant, they don't show him killing rivals or starving peasants,

10:14.720 --> 10:19.120
although they might also show him doing those things. They first show him executing his court

10:19.120 --> 10:23.520
jester, because the court jester is always the person most willing to tell the king the truth,

10:23.520 --> 10:27.280
and not pull any punches about it. And he can do this because he wraps it in comedy,

10:27.280 --> 10:32.480
but the truth is always still there. The funniest, goofiest characters in any archetypal story are

10:32.480 --> 10:37.440
also always the most wise. The one person that the hero turns to for wisdom just as much as for

10:37.440 --> 10:42.320
laughs. A good king knows that the fool is just as much of a hero as he is, that the fool is willing

10:42.320 --> 10:46.240
to look foolish if it means confronting the truth. They're willing to be seen as incompetent,

10:46.240 --> 10:50.160
so that they may learn to be competent. They're willing to be seen as dumb, so that they may

10:50.160 --> 10:54.640
acquire knowledge. They're willing to be seen as weak, so that they may grow strong. The heroic

10:54.640 --> 10:59.600
fool is looked down upon, but is constantly growing, and is always oriented towards the good,

10:59.600 --> 11:04.080
as best as they're able. The tyrannical king already believes that they know the good perfectly,

11:04.080 --> 11:09.040
and so they judge, but never truly grow or comprehend. In the progressive war on comedy,

11:09.040 --> 11:12.400
social justice is executing the court jesters of our culture.
