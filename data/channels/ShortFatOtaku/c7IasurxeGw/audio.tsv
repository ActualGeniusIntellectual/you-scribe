0	5840	This post is from the twitter account of Comedy Unleashed, London's free-thinking comedy club.
5840	10640	No self-censorship. If it's funny, it's funny. Trying to make a joke that doesn't offend anyone
10640	16000	in 2018. Well, 2019 might be just getting underway, but I have a feeling that sentiment
16000	20400	hasn't really changed yet. I first came to know about Comedy Unleashed and its commitment to
20400	25040	free speech within comedy when this behavioral agreement contract began floating around the
25040	29920	internet. It's basically a form where comedians agree to not make fun of certain topics that
29920	34880	social justice holds as sacred cows. This comedy night aims to provide a safe space for everyone
34880	39680	to come together and share and listen to comedy, with all proceeds donated to UNICEF. This is a
39680	44080	chance for all to be entertained and overjoyed by the different performances here on this day,
44080	49920	the 23rd of January 2019, hence the importance of this contract. This contract has been written to
49920	55200	ensure an environment where joy, love, and acceptance is reciprocated by all. By signing
55200	60320	this contract, you are agreeing to our no tolerance policy with regards to racism, sexism,
60320	67840	classism, ageism, ableism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, xenophobia, islamophobia, anti-religion,
67840	72800	or anti-atheism. All topics must be presented in a way that is respectful and kind. It does not mean
72800	77680	that these topics cannot be discussed, but it must be done in a respectful and non-abusive way. I can
77680	82640	tell you right off the bat, just using the rules of comedy, why this is a disastrous line of thinking.
82640	87680	All comedy, without exception, requires somebody or something to be the butt of the joke. Even the
87680	92720	tamest, least offensive jokes require somebody to end up looking like they've got egg on their face.
92720	97840	Here, let me show you. Here's a list of jokes for kids from redtricycle.com. Why did the student
97840	102160	eat his homework? Because the teacher told him it was a piece of cake. The butt of the joke is the
102160	106560	student that ate his homework. Or I guess the butt of the joke could be you, since you're the one
106560	111920	probably groaning at that terrible pun. The point is though, in comedy, somebody's got to be left
111920	117280	holding the bag. Somebody's the person getting laughed at. When you boil it down, there is no joke
117280	122240	that isn't at the expense of somebody else. At least a little bit. Even when the joke is about an object,
122240	127520	something like, say, an ugly looking car, for example, it still connects back to the car's owner
127520	132000	and whatever tastes they may have. If the person that is the butt of the joke takes offense, and we
132000	137200	use that as an excuse to call that form of comedy over the line, then we will not have any comedy at
137200	142240	all. Especially with how easily triggered people seem to get nowadays. This contract is not, as it
142240	146480	claims, a way to ensure that all are entertained and overjoyed by comedy, but rather that these
146480	151280	topics are not made the butt of the joke. These are the sacred precepts that you must not violate.
151280	155680	And just like a hypothetical variant of this contract from a decade ago may have only contained
155680	161280	racism, sexism, and homophobia, next year's variant will probably tack on a few more isms and phobias,
161280	165840	ever expanding the list of things you cannot joke about because they're just too serious.
165840	170320	And any comedian worth their salt is taking notice of this encroachment into the comedic space.
170320	174400	Konstantin Kissen, when presented with one of these contracts, refused to sign it and turned
174400	179120	down being a part of the UNICEF event. He did post the contract to Comedy Unleashed on Twitter though,
179120	182880	which triggered a relatively predictable backlash from the social justice crowd.
182880	187840	If your jokes align with violence against marginalized folks, then they're not jokes.
187840	192240	They're propaganda. We don't live in a hypersensitive world. People are finally being
192240	197040	held accountable. Except that, when you really think about it, everybody's marginalized.
197040	201840	Everybody's oppressed. Everybody's got some hidden burden they're carrying that you're not privy to,
201840	206000	that maybe even their friends and family aren't privy to. And you're sitting here making these
206000	210080	judgments based solely on what people present to the world. Maybe you're black. So okay,
210080	214400	let's ban racism from comedy. We don't want you to feel uncomfortable. Maybe you're a woman.
214400	219200	Okay, let's ban sexism. Maybe you're a rape victim. So let's ban rape jokes. Maybe you're
219200	224400	a Muslim. So let's ban jokes about Islam. They're Islamophobic. Maybe you're trans. Let's ban jokes
224400	229360	about trans people. They're transphobic. Maybe you're gay. Let's ban gay jokes since they're
229360	234480	homophobic. But why not ban jokes about the family? Maybe somebody in the crowd was abused
234480	239200	by their parents as a child and would be massively triggered by a joke about how the comedian's dad
239200	243280	sucked sometimes. They would definitely be oppressed by it. So we have to ban family-based
243280	247680	humor. How about we ban jokes about cars? Because maybe you lost your sister in a crash. How about
247680	252320	we ban jokes about student loans? Because maybe you're poor and can't afford to send your kid to
252320	256960	a good school. How about we ban jokes about video games? Because maybe as a kid you were relentlessly
256960	261200	bullied and only took solace in retreating to your home and playing games after school.
261200	265360	This is why when you remove the ability to have somebody be the butt of the joke,
265360	270320	you destroy all of comedy. Because everybody is the butt of the joke, at least at some point in
270320	275600	their lives. And everybody also carries some burden with them through life. If offense is
275600	280720	enough to censor comedy, then comedy ceases to exist. I would hate to imagine one of these
280720	285520	nightmarish social justice comedy sets. It would probably be less entertaining than the actual
285520	290880	social justice classes held at the same university. But that is where we're going. And you can tell
290880	296400	exactly how morally bankrupt a censor is based on what they come to the defense of in their censorship
296400	301520	of comedy. Mumkey Jones, recently banned from YouTube permanently for his comedic videos where
301520	306960	the butt of the joke was Elliot Rodger, tweeted that in 2017 he was banned for mocking Sharia law
306960	312080	and in 2018 he was banned for mocking school shooters. Who will YouTube stand behind in 2019?
312080	316080	My money is on pedophiles. No, that's Twitter dude. But I'll have to make another video for
316080	320400	that. The point is, whenever some large tech company censors jokes about an edgy topic,
320400	324880	they are coming to defense of that topic. I'm sure YouTube does not actually support Elliot
324880	329760	Rodger, but in censoring jokes about him and his point of view, they are acting as if they do.
329760	334240	On this topic, recently Louis CK decided to make his big comeback. I was never really a
334240	338720	fan of him even before all of the Me Too shit happened. I just didn't find him funny. He seemed
338720	342560	like he was trying to play to the progressive crowd a bit too much, presumably not fully
342560	346560	understanding that eventually, once they were done with the free speech comedy extremists,
346560	350480	they were going to come for him next. But apparently his return set was filled with edgy
350480	355040	jokes, drawing the ire of the social justice crowd, who had hoped he would just vanish after
355040	360000	his Me Too accusations, which really, to me, just sounded like Louis awkwardly asking women
360000	363760	if they wanted to watch him jerk off. The woman declined, he didn't force the issue,
363760	367840	and I don't personally consider requests for sexual contact to be themselves
367840	372000	sexual assault, unless he persisted after being rejected, which I don't think he did.
385040	414320	Louis CK marks Parkland
414320	418160	Survivors an audio of stand up routine. Comedians said of teen activists,
418160	424080	you're not interesting because you went to a high school where kids got shot. Well, he's not wrong.
424080	429680	CK also mocked political correctness among young people and requests by gender non-binary people
429680	434640	to be addressed by certain pronouns. He also discussed his own bad year, which was set in
434640	438960	train after he admitted to allegations of sexual misconduct. He went on to say he was really
438960	443280	disappointed in the younger generation, calling them boring, for objecting to what they consider
443280	447760	offensive comments. The routine was panned on social media. It was panned on social media
447760	451920	because the only social media accounts The Guardian ever pays attention to is the progressive
451920	456240	social justice cucklord wing of social media. Here's the thing that I can't stop thinking
456240	460880	about regarding Louis CK. Given the broader context of his behavior towards women, delivering
460880	465280	a set about everyone being too sensitive these days feels like a sly way to say the same about
465280	470960	women. No, Jessica Valenti, he made a joke at your expense. And you're protesting too much.
470960	476000	The fact that Louis CK's anti-Asian jokes weren't originally reported speaks volumes
476000	481680	to how casually Americans still treat anti-Asian racism. Oh, so apparently not only was Louis CK's
481680	485600	set taken from the pages of the Satanic Bible itself, but the fact that the media didn't
485600	490640	talk about his Asians have tiny dicks section is the real problem? You know what's the worst,
490640	495360	most boring kind of comedy? The kind where old white men are angry that old white men
495360	499280	can't do or say whatever the fuck they want anymore. You know what's actually the worst
499280	505600	kind of comedy? The neutered, impotent, lacking a punch, social justice approved comedy. And you
505600	509760	know what's the worst kind of comedian? The kind who are too scared to make jokes about anyone,
509760	514320	so they cuck out to people like you and censor themselves and attempt to censor others. If your
514320	519200	jokes are bad, people won't laugh. If your jokes are consistently bad, you'll find that your comedy
519200	524240	career won't pay the bills. And that should be the only consequence of bad comedy, not fucking
524240	529680	witch hunts. Louis CK's new set apparently has a section attacking non-binary people. He thinks
529680	534720	it's wrong to use they as a singular pronoun. I, on the other hand, think it's wrong to sexually
534720	540560	assault people. Now see, that's actually a funny joke and is at the expense of Louis CK, and more
540560	545040	broadly the people who commit sexual assault. It's not necessarily an accurate joke because it's not
545040	549600	clear if Louis CK actually did that, but let's put it aside for a bit. This is a funny joke from an
549600	555840	SJW, at the expense of Louis CK. But because it trivializes sexual assault or whatever,
555840	560720	expect this person to be similarly excommunicated from social justice. This is why progressives
560720	565120	can't do comedy, and hell, why they can't meme. Because every time somebody's on the receiving
565120	570080	end of a joke, somebody else is going to yank a reason out of their ass to call foul. Louis CK
570080	574320	isn't being denied work because he tells stupid, unfunny jokes. He's being denied work because he's
574320	579200	a serial workplace sexual predator. The only problem is, if there were no accusations against
579200	583840	Louis CK, there would still be attempts to deplatform him based on this recent set.
583840	587200	You may have a convenient excuse with him, but that doesn't mean it's the reason.
587200	591280	Count Dankula has never had MeToo accusations hit him, and yet he's still one of the most
591280	596560	maligned comedians to ever exist due to the whole Nazi pug thing. It is always about censoring
596560	601360	speech. It just becomes a bit easier on the optics if the speaker has skeletons in his closet.
601360	605600	I'm happy to throw in with the free speech extremist lot, but to me free speech is even
605600	610240	more important when it comes to comedy. Think of it this way. Whenever a story wants to show
610240	614720	a king to truly be a tyrant, they don't show him killing rivals or starving peasants,
614720	619120	although they might also show him doing those things. They first show him executing his court
619120	623520	jester, because the court jester is always the person most willing to tell the king the truth,
623520	627280	and not pull any punches about it. And he can do this because he wraps it in comedy,
627280	632480	but the truth is always still there. The funniest, goofiest characters in any archetypal story are
632480	637440	also always the most wise. The one person that the hero turns to for wisdom just as much as for
637440	642320	laughs. A good king knows that the fool is just as much of a hero as he is, that the fool is willing
642320	646240	to look foolish if it means confronting the truth. They're willing to be seen as incompetent,
646240	650160	so that they may learn to be competent. They're willing to be seen as dumb, so that they may
650160	654640	acquire knowledge. They're willing to be seen as weak, so that they may grow strong. The heroic
654640	659600	fool is looked down upon, but is constantly growing, and is always oriented towards the good,
659600	664080	as best as they're able. The tyrannical king already believes that they know the good perfectly,
664080	669040	and so they judge, but never truly grow or comprehend. In the progressive war on comedy,
669040	672400	social justice is executing the court jesters of our culture.
