00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
This post is from the twitter account of Comedy Unleashed, London's free-thinking comedy club.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,640
No self-censorship. If it's funny, it's funny. Trying to make a joke that doesn't offend anyone

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
in 2018. Well, 2019 might be just getting underway, but I have a feeling that sentiment

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,400
hasn't really changed yet. I first came to know about Comedy Unleashed and its commitment to

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,040
free speech within comedy when this behavioral agreement contract began floating around the

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,920
internet. It's basically a form where comedians agree to not make fun of certain topics that

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,880
social justice holds as sacred cows. This comedy night aims to provide a safe space for everyone

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,680
to come together and share and listen to comedy, with all proceeds donated to UNICEF. This is a

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,080
chance for all to be entertained and overjoyed by the different performances here on this day,

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,920
the 23rd of January 2019, hence the importance of this contract. This contract has been written to

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,200
ensure an environment where joy, love, and acceptance is reciprocated by all. By signing

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,320
this contract, you are agreeing to our no tolerance policy with regards to racism, sexism,

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:07,840
classism, ageism, ableism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, xenophobia, islamophobia, anti-religion,

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,800
or anti-atheism. All topics must be presented in a way that is respectful and kind. It does not mean

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,680
that these topics cannot be discussed, but it must be done in a respectful and non-abusive way. I can

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,640
tell you right off the bat, just using the rules of comedy, why this is a disastrous line of thinking.

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,680
All comedy, without exception, requires somebody or something to be the butt of the joke. Even the

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,720
tamest, least offensive jokes require somebody to end up looking like they've got egg on their face.

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,840
Here, let me show you. Here's a list of jokes for kids from redtricycle.com. Why did the student

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,160
eat his homework? Because the teacher told him it was a piece of cake. The butt of the joke is the

21
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,560
student that ate his homework. Or I guess the butt of the joke could be you, since you're the one

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,920
probably groaning at that terrible pun. The point is though, in comedy, somebody's got to be left

23
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,280
holding the bag. Somebody's the person getting laughed at. When you boil it down, there is no joke

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,240
that isn't at the expense of somebody else. At least a little bit. Even when the joke is about an object,

25
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,520
something like, say, an ugly looking car, for example, it still connects back to the car's owner

26
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,000
and whatever tastes they may have. If the person that is the butt of the joke takes offense, and we

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,200
use that as an excuse to call that form of comedy over the line, then we will not have any comedy at

28
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,240
all. Especially with how easily triggered people seem to get nowadays. This contract is not, as it

29
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,480
claims, a way to ensure that all are entertained and overjoyed by comedy, but rather that these

30
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,280
topics are not made the butt of the joke. These are the sacred precepts that you must not violate.

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,680
And just like a hypothetical variant of this contract from a decade ago may have only contained

32
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,280
racism, sexism, and homophobia, next year's variant will probably tack on a few more isms and phobias,

33
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,840
ever expanding the list of things you cannot joke about because they're just too serious.

34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,320
And any comedian worth their salt is taking notice of this encroachment into the comedic space.

35
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,400
Konstantin Kissen, when presented with one of these contracts, refused to sign it and turned

36
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,120
down being a part of the UNICEF event. He did post the contract to Comedy Unleashed on Twitter though,

37
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,880
which triggered a relatively predictable backlash from the social justice crowd.

38
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,840
If your jokes align with violence against marginalized folks, then they're not jokes.

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,240
They're propaganda. We don't live in a hypersensitive world. People are finally being

40
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,040
held accountable. Except that, when you really think about it, everybody's marginalized.

41
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,840
Everybody's oppressed. Everybody's got some hidden burden they're carrying that you're not privy to,

42
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,000
that maybe even their friends and family aren't privy to. And you're sitting here making these

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,080
judgments based solely on what people present to the world. Maybe you're black. So okay,

44
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,400
let's ban racism from comedy. We don't want you to feel uncomfortable. Maybe you're a woman.

45
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,200
Okay, let's ban sexism. Maybe you're a rape victim. So let's ban rape jokes. Maybe you're

46
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,400
a Muslim. So let's ban jokes about Islam. They're Islamophobic. Maybe you're trans. Let's ban jokes

47
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,360
about trans people. They're transphobic. Maybe you're gay. Let's ban gay jokes since they're

48
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,480
homophobic. But why not ban jokes about the family? Maybe somebody in the crowd was abused

49
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,200
by their parents as a child and would be massively triggered by a joke about how the comedian's dad

50
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,280
sucked sometimes. They would definitely be oppressed by it. So we have to ban family-based

51
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,680
humor. How about we ban jokes about cars? Because maybe you lost your sister in a crash. How about

52
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,320
we ban jokes about student loans? Because maybe you're poor and can't afford to send your kid to

53
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,960
a good school. How about we ban jokes about video games? Because maybe as a kid you were relentlessly

54
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,200
bullied and only took solace in retreating to your home and playing games after school.

55
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,360
This is why when you remove the ability to have somebody be the butt of the joke,

56
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,320
you destroy all of comedy. Because everybody is the butt of the joke, at least at some point in

57
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,600
their lives. And everybody also carries some burden with them through life. If offense is

58
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,720
enough to censor comedy, then comedy ceases to exist. I would hate to imagine one of these

59
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,520
nightmarish social justice comedy sets. It would probably be less entertaining than the actual

60
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,880
social justice classes held at the same university. But that is where we're going. And you can tell

61
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,400
exactly how morally bankrupt a censor is based on what they come to the defense of in their censorship

62
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,520
of comedy. Mumkey Jones, recently banned from YouTube permanently for his comedic videos where

63
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,960
the butt of the joke was Elliot Rodger, tweeted that in 2017 he was banned for mocking Sharia law

64
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,080
and in 2018 he was banned for mocking school shooters. Who will YouTube stand behind in 2019?

65
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,080
My money is on pedophiles. No, that's Twitter dude. But I'll have to make another video for

66
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,400
that. The point is, whenever some large tech company censors jokes about an edgy topic,

67
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,880
they are coming to defense of that topic. I'm sure YouTube does not actually support Elliot

68
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,760
Rodger, but in censoring jokes about him and his point of view, they are acting as if they do.

69
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,240
On this topic, recently Louis CK decided to make his big comeback. I was never really a

70
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,720
fan of him even before all of the Me Too shit happened. I just didn't find him funny. He seemed

71
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,560
like he was trying to play to the progressive crowd a bit too much, presumably not fully

72
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,560
understanding that eventually, once they were done with the free speech comedy extremists,

73
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,480
they were going to come for him next. But apparently his return set was filled with edgy

74
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,040
jokes, drawing the ire of the social justice crowd, who had hoped he would just vanish after

75
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,000
his Me Too accusations, which really, to me, just sounded like Louis awkwardly asking women

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,760
if they wanted to watch him jerk off. The woman declined, he didn't force the issue,

77
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,840
and I don't personally consider requests for sexual contact to be themselves

78
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,000
sexual assault, unless he persisted after being rejected, which I don't think he did.

79
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:54,320
Louis CK marks Parkland

80
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,160
Survivors an audio of stand up routine. Comedians said of teen activists,

81
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,080
you're not interesting because you went to a high school where kids got shot. Well, he's not wrong.

82
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,680
CK also mocked political correctness among young people and requests by gender non-binary people

83
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,640
to be addressed by certain pronouns. He also discussed his own bad year, which was set in

84
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,960
train after he admitted to allegations of sexual misconduct. He went on to say he was really

85
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,280
disappointed in the younger generation, calling them boring, for objecting to what they consider

86
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,760
offensive comments. The routine was panned on social media. It was panned on social media

87
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,920
because the only social media accounts The Guardian ever pays attention to is the progressive

88
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,240
social justice cucklord wing of social media. Here's the thing that I can't stop thinking

89
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,880
about regarding Louis CK. Given the broader context of his behavior towards women, delivering

90
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,280
a set about everyone being too sensitive these days feels like a sly way to say the same about

91
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,960
women. No, Jessica Valenti, he made a joke at your expense. And you're protesting too much.

92
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,000
The fact that Louis CK's anti-Asian jokes weren't originally reported speaks volumes

93
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,680
to how casually Americans still treat anti-Asian racism. Oh, so apparently not only was Louis CK's

94
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,600
set taken from the pages of the Satanic Bible itself, but the fact that the media didn't

95
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,640
talk about his Asians have tiny dicks section is the real problem? You know what's the worst,

96
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,360
most boring kind of comedy? The kind where old white men are angry that old white men

97
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,280
can't do or say whatever the fuck they want anymore. You know what's actually the worst

98
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,600
kind of comedy? The neutered, impotent, lacking a punch, social justice approved comedy. And you

99
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,760
know what's the worst kind of comedian? The kind who are too scared to make jokes about anyone,

100
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,320
so they cuck out to people like you and censor themselves and attempt to censor others. If your

101
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,200
jokes are bad, people won't laugh. If your jokes are consistently bad, you'll find that your comedy

102
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,240
career won't pay the bills. And that should be the only consequence of bad comedy, not fucking

103
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,680
witch hunts. Louis CK's new set apparently has a section attacking non-binary people. He thinks

104
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,720
it's wrong to use they as a singular pronoun. I, on the other hand, think it's wrong to sexually

105
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,560
assault people. Now see, that's actually a funny joke and is at the expense of Louis CK, and more

106
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,040
broadly the people who commit sexual assault. It's not necessarily an accurate joke because it's not

107
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,600
clear if Louis CK actually did that, but let's put it aside for a bit. This is a funny joke from an

108
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,840
SJW, at the expense of Louis CK. But because it trivializes sexual assault or whatever,

109
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,720
expect this person to be similarly excommunicated from social justice. This is why progressives

110
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,120
can't do comedy, and hell, why they can't meme. Because every time somebody's on the receiving

111
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,080
end of a joke, somebody else is going to yank a reason out of their ass to call foul. Louis CK

112
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,320
isn't being denied work because he tells stupid, unfunny jokes. He's being denied work because he's

113
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,200
a serial workplace sexual predator. The only problem is, if there were no accusations against

114
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,840
Louis CK, there would still be attempts to deplatform him based on this recent set.

115
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,200
You may have a convenient excuse with him, but that doesn't mean it's the reason.

116
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,280
Count Dankula has never had MeToo accusations hit him, and yet he's still one of the most

117
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,560
maligned comedians to ever exist due to the whole Nazi pug thing. It is always about censoring

118
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,360
speech. It just becomes a bit easier on the optics if the speaker has skeletons in his closet.

119
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,600
I'm happy to throw in with the free speech extremist lot, but to me free speech is even

120
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,240
more important when it comes to comedy. Think of it this way. Whenever a story wants to show

121
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,720
a king to truly be a tyrant, they don't show him killing rivals or starving peasants,

122
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,120
although they might also show him doing those things. They first show him executing his court

123
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,520
jester, because the court jester is always the person most willing to tell the king the truth,

124
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,280
and not pull any punches about it. And he can do this because he wraps it in comedy,

125
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,480
but the truth is always still there. The funniest, goofiest characters in any archetypal story are

126
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,440
also always the most wise. The one person that the hero turns to for wisdom just as much as for

127
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,320
laughs. A good king knows that the fool is just as much of a hero as he is, that the fool is willing

128
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,240
to look foolish if it means confronting the truth. They're willing to be seen as incompetent,

129
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,160
so that they may learn to be competent. They're willing to be seen as dumb, so that they may

130
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,640
acquire knowledge. They're willing to be seen as weak, so that they may grow strong. The heroic

131
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,600
fool is looked down upon, but is constantly growing, and is always oriented towards the good,

132
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,080
as best as they're able. The tyrannical king already believes that they know the good perfectly,

133
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,040
and so they judge, but never truly grow or comprehend. In the progressive war on comedy,

134
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,400
social justice is executing the court jesters of our culture.
