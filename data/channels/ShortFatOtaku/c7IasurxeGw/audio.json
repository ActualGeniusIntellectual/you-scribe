{"text": " This post is from the twitter account of Comedy Unleashed, London's free-thinking comedy club. No self-censorship. If it's funny, it's funny. Trying to make a joke that doesn't offend anyone in 2018. Well, 2019 might be just getting underway, but I have a feeling that sentiment hasn't really changed yet. I first came to know about Comedy Unleashed and its commitment to free speech within comedy when this behavioral agreement contract began floating around the internet. It's basically a form where comedians agree to not make fun of certain topics that social justice holds as sacred cows. This comedy night aims to provide a safe space for everyone to come together and share and listen to comedy, with all proceeds donated to UNICEF. This is a chance for all to be entertained and overjoyed by the different performances here on this day, the 23rd of January 2019, hence the importance of this contract. This contract has been written to ensure an environment where joy, love, and acceptance is reciprocated by all. By signing this contract, you are agreeing to our no tolerance policy with regards to racism, sexism, classism, ageism, ableism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, xenophobia, islamophobia, anti-religion, or anti-atheism. All topics must be presented in a way that is respectful and kind. It does not mean that these topics cannot be discussed, but it must be done in a respectful and non-abusive way. I can tell you right off the bat, just using the rules of comedy, why this is a disastrous line of thinking. All comedy, without exception, requires somebody or something to be the butt of the joke. Even the tamest, least offensive jokes require somebody to end up looking like they've got egg on their face. Here, let me show you. Here's a list of jokes for kids from redtricycle.com. Why did the student eat his homework? Because the teacher told him it was a piece of cake. The butt of the joke is the student that ate his homework. Or I guess the butt of the joke could be you, since you're the one probably groaning at that terrible pun. The point is though, in comedy, somebody's got to be left holding the bag. Somebody's the person getting laughed at. When you boil it down, there is no joke that isn't at the expense of somebody else. At least a little bit. Even when the joke is about an object, something like, say, an ugly looking car, for example, it still connects back to the car's owner and whatever tastes they may have. If the person that is the butt of the joke takes offense, and we use that as an excuse to call that form of comedy over the line, then we will not have any comedy at all. Especially with how easily triggered people seem to get nowadays. This contract is not, as it claims, a way to ensure that all are entertained and overjoyed by comedy, but rather that these topics are not made the butt of the joke. These are the sacred precepts that you must not violate. And just like a hypothetical variant of this contract from a decade ago may have only contained racism, sexism, and homophobia, next year's variant will probably tack on a few more isms and phobias, ever expanding the list of things you cannot joke about because they're just too serious. And any comedian worth their salt is taking notice of this encroachment into the comedic space. Konstantin Kissen, when presented with one of these contracts, refused to sign it and turned down being a part of the UNICEF event. He did post the contract to Comedy Unleashed on Twitter though, which triggered a relatively predictable backlash from the social justice crowd. If your jokes align with violence against marginalized folks, then they're not jokes. They're propaganda. We don't live in a hypersensitive world. People are finally being held accountable. Except that, when you really think about it, everybody's marginalized. Everybody's oppressed. Everybody's got some hidden burden they're carrying that you're not privy to, that maybe even their friends and family aren't privy to. And you're sitting here making these judgments based solely on what people present to the world. Maybe you're black. So okay, let's ban racism from comedy. We don't want you to feel uncomfortable. Maybe you're a woman. Okay, let's ban sexism. Maybe you're a rape victim. So let's ban rape jokes. Maybe you're a Muslim. So let's ban jokes about Islam. They're Islamophobic. Maybe you're trans. Let's ban jokes about trans people. They're transphobic. Maybe you're gay. Let's ban gay jokes since they're homophobic. But why not ban jokes about the family? Maybe somebody in the crowd was abused by their parents as a child and would be massively triggered by a joke about how the comedian's dad sucked sometimes. They would definitely be oppressed by it. So we have to ban family-based humor. How about we ban jokes about cars? Because maybe you lost your sister in a crash. How about we ban jokes about student loans? Because maybe you're poor and can't afford to send your kid to a good school. How about we ban jokes about video games? Because maybe as a kid you were relentlessly bullied and only took solace in retreating to your home and playing games after school. This is why when you remove the ability to have somebody be the butt of the joke, you destroy all of comedy. Because everybody is the butt of the joke, at least at some point in their lives. And everybody also carries some burden with them through life. If offense is enough to censor comedy, then comedy ceases to exist. I would hate to imagine one of these nightmarish social justice comedy sets. It would probably be less entertaining than the actual social justice classes held at the same university. But that is where we're going. And you can tell exactly how morally bankrupt a censor is based on what they come to the defense of in their censorship of comedy. Mumkey Jones, recently banned from YouTube permanently for his comedic videos where the butt of the joke was Elliot Rodger, tweeted that in 2017 he was banned for mocking Sharia law and in 2018 he was banned for mocking school shooters. Who will YouTube stand behind in 2019? My money is on pedophiles. No, that's Twitter dude. But I'll have to make another video for that. The point is, whenever some large tech company censors jokes about an edgy topic, they are coming to defense of that topic. I'm sure YouTube does not actually support Elliot Rodger, but in censoring jokes about him and his point of view, they are acting as if they do. On this topic, recently Louis CK decided to make his big comeback. I was never really a fan of him even before all of the Me Too shit happened. I just didn't find him funny. He seemed like he was trying to play to the progressive crowd a bit too much, presumably not fully understanding that eventually, once they were done with the free speech comedy extremists, they were going to come for him next. But apparently his return set was filled with edgy jokes, drawing the ire of the social justice crowd, who had hoped he would just vanish after his Me Too accusations, which really, to me, just sounded like Louis awkwardly asking women if they wanted to watch him jerk off. The woman declined, he didn't force the issue, and I don't personally consider requests for sexual contact to be themselves sexual assault, unless he persisted after being rejected, which I don't think he did. Louis CK marks Parkland Survivors an audio of stand up routine. Comedians said of teen activists, you're not interesting because you went to a high school where kids got shot. Well, he's not wrong. CK also mocked political correctness among young people and requests by gender non-binary people to be addressed by certain pronouns. He also discussed his own bad year, which was set in train after he admitted to allegations of sexual misconduct. He went on to say he was really disappointed in the younger generation, calling them boring, for objecting to what they consider offensive comments. The routine was panned on social media. It was panned on social media because the only social media accounts The Guardian ever pays attention to is the progressive social justice cucklord wing of social media. Here's the thing that I can't stop thinking about regarding Louis CK. Given the broader context of his behavior towards women, delivering a set about everyone being too sensitive these days feels like a sly way to say the same about women. No, Jessica Valenti, he made a joke at your expense. And you're protesting too much. The fact that Louis CK's anti-Asian jokes weren't originally reported speaks volumes to how casually Americans still treat anti-Asian racism. Oh, so apparently not only was Louis CK's set taken from the pages of the Satanic Bible itself, but the fact that the media didn't talk about his Asians have tiny dicks section is the real problem? You know what's the worst, most boring kind of comedy? The kind where old white men are angry that old white men can't do or say whatever the fuck they want anymore. You know what's actually the worst kind of comedy? The neutered, impotent, lacking a punch, social justice approved comedy. And you know what's the worst kind of comedian? The kind who are too scared to make jokes about anyone, so they cuck out to people like you and censor themselves and attempt to censor others. If your jokes are bad, people won't laugh. If your jokes are consistently bad, you'll find that your comedy career won't pay the bills. And that should be the only consequence of bad comedy, not fucking witch hunts. Louis CK's new set apparently has a section attacking non-binary people. He thinks it's wrong to use they as a singular pronoun. I, on the other hand, think it's wrong to sexually assault people. Now see, that's actually a funny joke and is at the expense of Louis CK, and more broadly the people who commit sexual assault. It's not necessarily an accurate joke because it's not clear if Louis CK actually did that, but let's put it aside for a bit. This is a funny joke from an SJW, at the expense of Louis CK. But because it trivializes sexual assault or whatever, expect this person to be similarly excommunicated from social justice. This is why progressives can't do comedy, and hell, why they can't meme. Because every time somebody's on the receiving end of a joke, somebody else is going to yank a reason out of their ass to call foul. Louis CK isn't being denied work because he tells stupid, unfunny jokes. He's being denied work because he's a serial workplace sexual predator. The only problem is, if there were no accusations against Louis CK, there would still be attempts to deplatform him based on this recent set. You may have a convenient excuse with him, but that doesn't mean it's the reason. Count Dankula has never had MeToo accusations hit him, and yet he's still one of the most maligned comedians to ever exist due to the whole Nazi pug thing. It is always about censoring speech. It just becomes a bit easier on the optics if the speaker has skeletons in his closet. I'm happy to throw in with the free speech extremist lot, but to me free speech is even more important when it comes to comedy. Think of it this way. Whenever a story wants to show a king to truly be a tyrant, they don't show him killing rivals or starving peasants, although they might also show him doing those things. They first show him executing his court jester, because the court jester is always the person most willing to tell the king the truth, and not pull any punches about it. And he can do this because he wraps it in comedy, but the truth is always still there. The funniest, goofiest characters in any archetypal story are also always the most wise. The one person that the hero turns to for wisdom just as much as for laughs. A good king knows that the fool is just as much of a hero as he is, that the fool is willing to look foolish if it means confronting the truth. They're willing to be seen as incompetent, so that they may learn to be competent. They're willing to be seen as dumb, so that they may acquire knowledge. They're willing to be seen as weak, so that they may grow strong. The heroic fool is looked down upon, but is constantly growing, and is always oriented towards the good, as best as they're able. The tyrannical king already believes that they know the good perfectly, and so they judge, but never truly grow or comprehend. In the progressive war on comedy, social justice is executing the court jesters of our culture.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 5.84, "text": " This post is from the twitter account of Comedy Unleashed, London's free-thinking comedy club.", "tokens": [50363, 770, 1281, 318, 422, 262, 17044, 1848, 286, 22329, 44747, 11, 3576, 338, 1479, 12, 28973, 10997, 3430, 13, 50655], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.0936655771164667, "compression_ratio": 1.6547619047619047, "no_speech_prob": 0.0016429884126409888}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 5.84, "end": 10.64, "text": " No self-censorship.
