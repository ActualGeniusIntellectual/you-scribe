0	3880	I guess my channel is going to turn into Pewdiepie's at least for a little bit because I'm actually
3880	6680	going to do a meme review believe it or not.
6680	9600	This is not the kind of thing I usually do but this is actually somewhat relevant and
9600	12960	in fact it is a meme that I am really, really enjoying.
12960	15480	Doesn't Pewds have a song for meme review anyway?
15480	16480	Yeah.
16480	20600	Isn't it like, leave your entries in the subreddit bros.
20600	23640	No wait that's, that's L-W-I-A well you know it's all basically the same show anyway it
23640	24640	seems like.
24640	26400	It's okay I like Pewdiepie quite a bit.
26400	28580	But anyway, meme review.
28580	30740	This article popped up about a month ago.
30740	35920	The canals of Venice run clear as coronavirus halts traffic, bringing back the lagoon waters
35920	37480	of ancient times.
37480	42280	The popular tourist destination is in lockdown with visitors staying away and residents self-isolating.
42280	46940	An absence of boats has caused the once turbid waters to clear, revealing fish populations.
46940	47940	Oh that's real cool.
47940	51660	Yeah and here in the article you got these screenshots where you can see the fish swimming
51660	54380	around and how clear the waters are.
54380	55980	It's actually kind of neat.
55980	60900	And in fact the European Space Agency released two pictures, one from recently and one from
60900	61900	about a year ago.
61900	64900	And you can actually see the difference.
64900	69300	You can actually see how Venice has changed from space.
69300	71220	It's kind of interesting.
71220	73960	And you have other similar events too like this one.
73960	74960	Nature is healing.
74960	77580	New pollution free world thanks to COVID-19.
77580	79860	The pyramids in Egypt are now visible from Theca road.
79860	83700	And you know what that would actually be a really breathtaking view to behold yourself.
83700	89580	The point is that there's two phrases nature is healing and we are the virus.
89580	94780	If you search those on Twitter you will get some extreme ridiculousness.
94780	95780	It's pretty awesome.
95780	98860	Sharks are finally enjoying the wilderness now that humans are gone.
98860	99860	We are the virus.
99860	100860	What is this?
100860	101860	Yeah.
101860	112820	You know I can't find it anywhere.
112820	116820	Is he going to jump in?
116820	117820	Yep.
117820	118820	Okay.
118820	120940	I can't find the video anymore.
120940	125420	But a few weeks ago there was a video of a guy who was walking around an abandoned city
125420	131580	in like a T-Rex like animatronic T-Rex suit and the police were yelling at him.
131580	136300	And it was playing the Jurassic Park theme.
136300	140020	Now that the smog has cleared up we can see Denver all the way from New York.
140020	141020	The earth is healing.
141020	142020	We are the virus.
142020	144820	Oh is that like the halo remastered?
144820	145820	Man that actually looks pretty good.
145820	149020	I wonder if it'd be worth playing on Game Boomers probably honestly.
149020	150020	The earth is healing.
150020	151220	We are the virus.
151220	153340	Don't do it Mr. Bird.
153340	154340	You're going to get lung cancer.
154340	157860	You're going to have a pre-existing condition and COVID will get you.
157860	159580	The Daleks are returning to England.
159580	160900	The world is healing itself.
161540	164180	You know I never liked Doctor Who.
164180	170340	Even back during the good seasons people call certain doctors like better doctors than others.
170340	171340	I never understood it.
171340	172340	I never got it.
172340	173340	You know?
173340	174340	I was always more of a Star Trek guy.
174340	177140	Well I mean until recently obviously but still.
177140	179420	This picture was taken downtown just yesterday.
179420	180940	Nature is returning.
180940	181940	We are the virus.
181940	182940	Jesus.
182940	187180	Man the Cats movie really was just nightmarish wasn't it?
187180	189300	And you know they're making a new one too with the same technology.
189300	192900	They're doing like a live-action Robin Hood where it's Robin Hood as like an anthropomorphic
192900	194620	fox furry kind of guy.
194620	197460	You think one box office flop is enough Disney?
197460	198940	Cows are returning to the sea.
198940	200380	Nature is healing.
200380	201620	We are the virus.
201620	203420	How did they get this picture?
203420	205020	That's like a real cow.
205020	208380	They just okay.
208380	211140	For the first time in four generations the headphone jack is returning.
211140	212140	Nature is healing.
212140	213140	We are the virus.
213140	214140	Yeah well you know what?
214140	217740	If you were a big brain like me you'd still be using what I have right here.
217740	224980	This this old Galaxy S2 it still has it's from like 2009 or whatever and it still has
224980	225980	the old headphone jack.
225980	228580	Let's listen to these ancient sound effects dude.
228580	235580	I don't know I just never felt the need to get a new phone to be honest.
235580	238180	Like this one still works.
238180	241740	I think the text of this one is actually the original text that started the meme.
241740	244460	Here's an unexpected side effect of the pandemic.
244460	249580	Since the humans are inside the native wildlife is returning for the first time in years.
249580	251540	Nature is healing and we are the virus.
251540	254620	Now this picture obviously isn't the first picture like like whatever whatever picture
254620	258920	started this meme it was a serious post it's just that this text went viral.
258920	263660	I do like that people are taking the opportunity to dress up like complete idiots in really
263660	267460	weird suits and do things outside.
267460	269300	Crabs are back in the airports.
269300	270300	Nature is healing.
270300	271380	What's this video?
271380	272380	Who flew with crabs?
272380	275180	What is this video?
275180	282220	Oh god someone actually put like crabs they put crab someone put like a box full of crabs
282220	288020	in in in the luggage in the plane and now they're just all over the place.
288020	291100	Oh my god why why would anyone do this?
291100	295100	I'm kind of half expecting the the crab dance to start playing here and I guess normally
295100	298740	I'd cut that in for a gag but last time I did that I got copyright struck on YouTube
298740	301300	so you'll just have to imagine it I guess.
301300	314980	Nature is healing man look at the hips on her damn girl you uh you want to get together
314980	319780	some time and do some photosynthesis together cookies have returned to the sewing kits nature
319780	323920	is healing we are the virus yeah I do have even though I've never actually eaten any
323920	327180	of these cookies before in my life I really don't like them I have about five of these
327180	330700	containers around the house just various things stuck in them just because usually
330700	334640	like my parents were throwing them out I need a container so I'd take one or like they would
334640	340140	give me something that they had that was in a container and now I have it I think I've
340140	344400	actually seen more of these containers with random things in them than with the actual
344400	349500	cookies the rest of the space needles have returned to Seattle the earth is healing it
349500	353420	actually looks a little bit more like an alien invasion to me to be honest maybe that's what
353420	356820	it actually is though guys or or you know what it's probably something even worse I
356860	363340	think the original Seattle space needle is probably a giant 5g tower causing coronavirus
363340	367900	for the entire world that's what's happening there we go I've solved it pasta is returning
367900	372640	to its native habitat in Tesco nature is healing you know where I am locally we've actually
372640	379140	kind of got past the uh the the shortages stage you can still only buy like two of certain
379140	383160	items in grocery stores but the the shelves are pretty much stocked now like they're they're
383160	387400	okay I actually went to the grocery store yesterday and and the cashiers are wearing
387400	392000	like face shields not just like breathing masks but like the full like like covers your
392000	395560	whole head face shield and there's tape on the ground that says okay make sure to stay
395560	398720	six feet apart from each other etc and it's like okay but I have some acquaintances that
398720	402340	work at the store and I asked them like hey are you guys actually doing anything meaningfully
402340	406480	different like in in the background and they're all like no we're just working as usual because
406480	410200	I mean what's gonna happen right it's like okay yeah fair enough there really does seem
410200	414140	to be more of a perception of a problem than an actual problem at least in some locations
414140	418400	right now because everyone in Italy is quarantined the natural wildlife has returned to the water
418400	425760	and forests we have the virus excuse me this is obviously a faked photo both of those pictures
425760	431400	are of New York style pepperoni pizzas those are not authentic Italian pizzas so obviously
431400	436840	someone set this up wildlife is returning to the Scottish streets nature was what the
436840	441760	fuck is this this just has to be some Scottish thing that I don't get maybe it's just because
441760	445620	I don't know Scottish people have red hair I don't know maybe Dankula can fill me in
445620	449560	or something with everyone on lockdown the trucks have returned to their water holes
449560	454480	oh isn't nature beautiful I wonder what actually happened here like is this just a Photoshop
454480	459380	or did did two trucks actually just drive into the river I've seen more ridiculous things
459380	463680	to be honest I just took this beautiful photo what's actually interesting about this photo
463680	466580	is I don't know if you guys know but this is actually a real picture I know that we
466580	471420	just have it ingrained in our heads now that it's the Windows XP default desktop theme
471420	476860	and it looks very computer-generated of how perfect it is but it actually is a real photo
476860	481220	yeah according to the internet the picture is named bliss and it was originally taken
481220	494780	here this is in California something like take the take these these stats here maybe
494780	499900	plug them into Google Maps and see what I can get and here it is Microsoft Windows XP
499900	509020	background photo site yeah check this out it's going to okay can I I can't Street View
509020	519220	it okay maybe I can just take a look at it from over here yeah okay I could see it this
519220	524140	is definitely the spot okay fair enough fair enough you get you got me good job wildlife
524140	529260	versus her into the city nature is healing as it just blows fire all across Tokyo there's
529260	535220	a period of time I was probably between like 16 and 18 when I was a little bit of an insomniac
535220	539180	and I would actually spend my nights either playing video games which I did quite a bit
539180	545940	or I watched late night TV and what was on late night TV often were really badly translated
545940	551700	Asian movies I actually got to see the clones of Bruce Lee then for the first time it's
551700	558060	a terrible movie however however I did in fact get to see some some Godzilla films and
558060	562020	you know this stuff like this this this cool animatronic stuff or like this cool stop-motion
562020	566020	stuff sometimes it's like people in suits walking around like a set that is obviously
566020	570420	just a bunch of buildings I really have a respect for like this era of filmmaking it's
570420	576380	not the same when they do it in CG you know here's my friend vague commander day 37 women
576380	581620	are returning to the kitchen nature is healing we are the virus and this is from the twitch
581620	589540	stream of one Ava quarantine girlfriend I went to school for philosophy wanting to discover truth
589540	597340	and justice but all I found out was that I was gay and trans I don't know if this qualifies as
597980	604820	women return to the kitchen maybe let's let's watch the video get my old headphones out guys
604820	616740	it's a layer cake it's a layer cake I did it look at that look at that that feel when men
616740	622060	make better women than women but I can't just steal PewDiePie schtick forever it is pretty
622060	626580	fun to just check out the current memes and laugh at their best iterations but it wouldn't
626580	633140	be an SFO video if I didn't try to at least end it with some kind of point or a vision or something
633140	638140	the reason this meme has been relatively successful at least kind of low-key is because of how it's
638140	643580	framed the whole nature is healing we are the virus thing as if human beings aren't part of
643580	648900	nature as if we don't exist alongside it as if we don't deserve a habitat just like every other
648900	654060	creature on the planet does but there's definitely this almost anti-humanist undercurrent but below
654060	659140	it with the whole we are the virus thing as if humanity is the problem the mere existence of
659140	663740	humanity is what is what makes everything terrible and at least in these people's minds I do think
663740	667460	that humanity on the whole is probably a good thing I don't know if that's a controversial
667460	672260	opinion nowadays but it's definitely how I feel even just avoiding any kind of religious arguments
672260	678940	which I am apt to do because I'm an atheist I do think that humanity is probably relatively unique
678940	684540	at least insofar as we know because we are definitely the first time that the universe
684540	689660	has been able to observe itself we are part of the universe we are made up of the same matter that
689660	694620	has always existed and yet we're also cognizant I think that's important I think that's different
694620	699100	and I think it's special I think it's worth preserving and this idea that the planet will
699100	703900	be better off without us it's like better off for who you might make the argument that yeah okay
703900	710340	mankind has done a tremendous number on mother nature but she gets her revenge on us and then
710340	716380	some we all get diseases we all get viruses obviously we all get sick we all die eventually
716380	721420	but if you think back like a year or two ago or even longer to be honest a lot of the the more
721420	728820	extreme climate alarmists were saying that unless humanity completely shuts down everything we are
728820	732580	doomed there will never be another generation of humans we're going to destroy the planet so much
732580	736700	it'll be completely uninhabitable you know I I do definitely believe that climate change is at
736700	741180	least partially man-made but I certainly don't buy the most doomerist of predictions when it comes to
741180	747020	this stuff but still that was always the claim we must shut everything down and the economic cost
747020	751900	be damned well at this point we've done that haven't we we are destroying our own economies
751900	756460	and forcing everyone to stay inside in order to get a handle on the coronavirus and in doing so
756460	763100	worldwide emissions have dropped tremendously and yet global lockdowns might reduce co2 emissions
763100	768380	but won't halt the climate crisis scientists say there's a difference between co2 emissions
768380	772780	and atmospheric concentrations of co2 well what the hell else do you want from us then we have now
772780	777580	unwillingly and not for the reasons that you initially wanted but we have now put into place
777580	782100	all of the recommendations you were looking for and apparently it's still not enough so what else
782100	786660	is there if it just so happens that climate change is irreversible and and I don't think that it is
786660	791580	well then screw it if turning into a complete fascist state where no one is allowed to leave
791580	797500	the house and all economic activity must be stopped using state force is still not enough
797500	802700	then it's not fucking worth it but most importantly I still do think that human ingenuity will solve
802700	807580	this problem you have this line here there's a difference between co2 emissions and atmospheric
807580	813140	concentrations of co2 okay so even if we stop all co2 emissions there's still all that extra co2
813140	817500	floating around on the atmosphere that we already put there and eventually the the plants and the
817500	822340	oceans will absorb that co2 and it'll kind of level out if we all happen to disappear but at
822340	826780	the same time there's still no reason why human ingenuity can't also speed that process along
826780	833660	there are ways to extract co2 from the air and I do have great hope that our cleverness will still
833660	839900	save us yet both in terms of the climate crisis and in terms of coronavirus but in the end the
839900	844700	reason why the climate activists wanted a global lockdown and now that they have one they're saying
844700	849740	that it's not enough is because we can't beat climate change under capitalism socialism is
849740	854180	the only way yes it's never really been about saving the planet it's always been about implementing
854180	860460	socialism that's why AOC's Green New Deal was chock full of socialism that's why other climate
860460	866260	activists always talk about not just the climate the science behind it but also about pushing
866260	871300	social justice bullshit the climate has always been their sneaky backdoor to bringing socialism
871300	876620	about because while there are many good arguments against socialism the honest truth is there's not
876620	881040	that many good arguments against environmentalism truthfully think about it for a minute even if
881040	886620	you don't believe that humanity is causing climate change we still do want the planet to be
886620	892700	inhabitable by humans even if its natural cycles make it so that it's not in the future if that is
892700	896340	the case we should probably work towards keeping things as they are secondly there's still no
896340	901500	problem with cleaning up the environment anyway like okay if you don't believe that climate change
901500	905980	is being caused by co2 emissions that humans are putting out fine you can still believe that all
905980	910420	the plastic in the ocean was put there by humans and didn't just naturally appear there you can
910420	914860	still feel like cleaning up oil spills and rescuing animals from their negative effects
914860	919940	is probably still a good thing and thirdly even if you don't believe in climate change getting off
919940	925380	of foreign oil and starting to use local renewable resources for our energy can only be a good thing
925380	930460	politically so because when you really think about it there's actually not really that much that's
930460	935620	bad about environmentalism that is what they're using to sneak socialism in and of course I
935620	940900	completely disagree with the whole point of this article here it is absolutely possible to be an
941140	945180	environmentalist and a capitalist and of course this is all something that we know very well
945180	950180	because of this this article from last year extinction rebellion isn't about the climate
950180	954580	extinction rebellion by the way it was a radical protest group regarding the climate I don't think
954580	958940	they really exist anymore they kind of had their 15 minutes of fame in 2019 and they died out but
958940	964540	this guy here says yes yes I know the climate is breaking down it's urgent an emergency we only got
964540	968860	a few years left to fix it but extinction rebellion isn't about the climate the climates breakdown is
968860	972620	a symptom of a toxic system that has infected the ways we relate to each other as humans and
972620	976780	to all life this was exacerbated when European civilization was spread around the globe through
976780	981740	cruelty and violence especially over the last 600 years of colonialism although the roots of
981740	987340	the infections go much further back see this is this is all about socialism it is all about
987340	994620	anti-western hatred this is all about post-modernist narcissism the delusion of white supremacy centers
994620	998380	whiteness in the experience of white people the delusion of the patriarchy centers the male
998460	1002460	experience the delusions of Eurocentrism and includes the notion that Europeans know what's
1002460	1008140	best for the listen how does any of this relate to the environment oh it doesn't oh you're just a
1008140	1012380	fucking Marxist trying to sneak all this shit in the back door get the fuck out of here extinction
1012380	1016460	rebellion isn't about the climate it's not even about climate justice although that's important
1016460	1020860	if we only talk about the climate we're missing the deeper problems plaguing our culture for these
1020860	1028060	people if capitalism actually managed to achieve all of the goals of environmentalism but didn't
1028060	1032060	implement socialism then it would still be a failure because they don't actually give a
1032060	1036780	shit about the environment and that's why i enjoy this meme because frankly it makes fun of the way
1036780	1041900	that these sanctimonious snobs actually feel about the environment they post a picture of a
1041900	1046460	deer running through their backyard or something they go oh nature is so beautiful humans are so
1046460	1051100	terrible and it's like fuck off man there are legitimate criticisms to be made regarding our
1051100	1055660	relationship with the environment but if your analysis of the situation ends with humans being
