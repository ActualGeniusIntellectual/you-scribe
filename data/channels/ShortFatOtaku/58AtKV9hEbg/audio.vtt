00:00.000 --> 00:03.880
I guess my channel is going to turn into Pewdiepie's at least for a little bit because I'm actually

00:03.880 --> 00:06.680
going to do a meme review believe it or not.

00:06.680 --> 00:09.600
This is not the kind of thing I usually do but this is actually somewhat relevant and

00:09.600 --> 00:12.960
in fact it is a meme that I am really, really enjoying.

00:12.960 --> 00:15.480
Doesn't Pewds have a song for meme review anyway?

00:15.480 --> 00:16.480
Yeah.

00:16.480 --> 00:20.600
Isn't it like, leave your entries in the subreddit bros.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.640
No wait that's, that's L-W-I-A well you know it's all basically the same show anyway it

00:23.640 --> 00:24.640
seems like.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.400
It's okay I like Pewdiepie quite a bit.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.580
But anyway, meme review.

00:28.580 --> 00:30.740
This article popped up about a month ago.

00:30.740 --> 00:35.920
The canals of Venice run clear as coronavirus halts traffic, bringing back the lagoon waters

00:35.920 --> 00:37.480
of ancient times.

00:37.480 --> 00:42.280
The popular tourist destination is in lockdown with visitors staying away and residents self-isolating.

00:42.280 --> 00:46.940
An absence of boats has caused the once turbid waters to clear, revealing fish populations.

00:46.940 --> 00:47.940
Oh that's real cool.

00:47.940 --> 00:51.660
Yeah and here in the article you got these screenshots where you can see the fish swimming

00:51.660 --> 00:54.380
around and how clear the waters are.

00:54.380 --> 00:55.980
It's actually kind of neat.

00:55.980 --> 01:00.900
And in fact the European Space Agency released two pictures, one from recently and one from

01:00.900 --> 01:01.900
about a year ago.

01:01.900 --> 01:04.900
And you can actually see the difference.

01:04.900 --> 01:09.300
You can actually see how Venice has changed from space.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.220
It's kind of interesting.

01:11.220 --> 01:13.960
And you have other similar events too like this one.

01:13.960 --> 01:14.960
Nature is healing.

01:14.960 --> 01:17.580
New pollution free world thanks to COVID-19.

01:17.580 --> 01:19.860
The pyramids in Egypt are now visible from Theca road.

01:19.860 --> 01:23.700
And you know what that would actually be a really breathtaking view to behold yourself.

01:23.700 --> 01:29.580
The point is that there's two phrases nature is healing and we are the virus.

01:29.580 --> 01:34.780
If you search those on Twitter you will get some extreme ridiculousness.

01:34.780 --> 01:35.780
It's pretty awesome.

01:35.780 --> 01:38.860
Sharks are finally enjoying the wilderness now that humans are gone.

01:38.860 --> 01:39.860
We are the virus.

01:39.860 --> 01:40.860
What is this?

01:40.860 --> 01:41.860
Yeah.

01:41.860 --> 01:52.820
You know I can't find it anywhere.

01:52.820 --> 01:56.820
Is he going to jump in?

01:56.820 --> 01:57.820
Yep.

01:57.820 --> 01:58.820
Okay.

01:58.820 --> 02:00.940
I can't find the video anymore.

02:00.940 --> 02:05.420
But a few weeks ago there was a video of a guy who was walking around an abandoned city

02:05.420 --> 02:11.580
in like a T-Rex like animatronic T-Rex suit and the police were yelling at him.

02:11.580 --> 02:16.300
And it was playing the Jurassic Park theme.

02:16.300 --> 02:20.020
Now that the smog has cleared up we can see Denver all the way from New York.

02:20.020 --> 02:21.020
The earth is healing.

02:21.020 --> 02:22.020
We are the virus.

02:22.020 --> 02:24.820
Oh is that like the halo remastered?

02:24.820 --> 02:25.820
Man that actually looks pretty good.

02:25.820 --> 02:29.020
I wonder if it'd be worth playing on Game Boomers probably honestly.

02:29.020 --> 02:30.020
The earth is healing.

02:30.020 --> 02:31.220
We are the virus.

02:31.220 --> 02:33.340
Don't do it Mr. Bird.

02:33.340 --> 02:34.340
You're going to get lung cancer.

02:34.340 --> 02:37.860
You're going to have a pre-existing condition and COVID will get you.

02:37.860 --> 02:39.580
The Daleks are returning to England.

02:39.580 --> 02:40.900
The world is healing itself.

02:41.540 --> 02:44.180
You know I never liked Doctor Who.

02:44.180 --> 02:50.340
Even back during the good seasons people call certain doctors like better doctors than others.

02:50.340 --> 02:51.340
I never understood it.

02:51.340 --> 02:52.340
I never got it.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.340
You know?

02:53.340 --> 02:54.340
I was always more of a Star Trek guy.

02:54.340 --> 02:57.140
Well I mean until recently obviously but still.

02:57.140 --> 02:59.420
This picture was taken downtown just yesterday.

02:59.420 --> 03:00.940
Nature is returning.

03:00.940 --> 03:01.940
We are the virus.

03:01.940 --> 03:02.940
Jesus.

03:02.940 --> 03:07.180
Man the Cats movie really was just nightmarish wasn't it?

03:07.180 --> 03:09.300
And you know they're making a new one too with the same technology.

03:09.300 --> 03:12.900
They're doing like a live-action Robin Hood where it's Robin Hood as like an anthropomorphic

03:12.900 --> 03:14.620
fox furry kind of guy.

03:14.620 --> 03:17.460
You think one box office flop is enough Disney?

03:17.460 --> 03:18.940
Cows are returning to the sea.

03:18.940 --> 03:20.380
Nature is healing.

03:20.380 --> 03:21.620
We are the virus.

03:21.620 --> 03:23.420
How did they get this picture?

03:23.420 --> 03:25.020
That's like a real cow.

03:25.020 --> 03:28.380
They just okay.

03:28.380 --> 03:31.140
For the first time in four generations the headphone jack is returning.

03:31.140 --> 03:32.140
Nature is healing.

03:32.140 --> 03:33.140
We are the virus.

03:33.140 --> 03:34.140
Yeah well you know what?

03:34.140 --> 03:37.740
If you were a big brain like me you'd still be using what I have right here.

03:37.740 --> 03:44.980
This this old Galaxy S2 it still has it's from like 2009 or whatever and it still has

03:44.980 --> 03:45.980
the old headphone jack.

03:45.980 --> 03:48.580
Let's listen to these ancient sound effects dude.

03:48.580 --> 03:55.580
I don't know I just never felt the need to get a new phone to be honest.

03:55.580 --> 03:58.180
Like this one still works.

03:58.180 --> 04:01.740
I think the text of this one is actually the original text that started the meme.

04:01.740 --> 04:04.460
Here's an unexpected side effect of the pandemic.

04:04.460 --> 04:09.580
Since the humans are inside the native wildlife is returning for the first time in years.

04:09.580 --> 04:11.540
Nature is healing and we are the virus.

04:11.540 --> 04:14.620
Now this picture obviously isn't the first picture like like whatever whatever picture

04:14.620 --> 04:18.920
started this meme it was a serious post it's just that this text went viral.

04:18.920 --> 04:23.660
I do like that people are taking the opportunity to dress up like complete idiots in really

04:23.660 --> 04:27.460
weird suits and do things outside.

04:27.460 --> 04:29.300
Crabs are back in the airports.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.300
Nature is healing.

04:30.300 --> 04:31.380
What's this video?

04:31.380 --> 04:32.380
Who flew with crabs?

04:32.380 --> 04:35.180
What is this video?

04:35.180 --> 04:42.220
Oh god someone actually put like crabs they put crab someone put like a box full of crabs

04:42.220 --> 04:48.020
in in in the luggage in the plane and now they're just all over the place.

04:48.020 --> 04:51.100
Oh my god why why would anyone do this?

04:51.100 --> 04:55.100
I'm kind of half expecting the the crab dance to start playing here and I guess normally

04:55.100 --> 04:58.740
I'd cut that in for a gag but last time I did that I got copyright struck on YouTube

04:58.740 --> 05:01.300
so you'll just have to imagine it I guess.

05:01.300 --> 05:14.980
Nature is healing man look at the hips on her damn girl you uh you want to get together

05:14.980 --> 05:19.780
some time and do some photosynthesis together cookies have returned to the sewing kits nature

05:19.780 --> 05:23.920
is healing we are the virus yeah I do have even though I've never actually eaten any

05:23.920 --> 05:27.180
of these cookies before in my life I really don't like them I have about five of these

05:27.180 --> 05:30.700
containers around the house just various things stuck in them just because usually

05:30.700 --> 05:34.640
like my parents were throwing them out I need a container so I'd take one or like they would

05:34.640 --> 05:40.140
give me something that they had that was in a container and now I have it I think I've

05:40.140 --> 05:44.400
actually seen more of these containers with random things in them than with the actual

05:44.400 --> 05:49.500
cookies the rest of the space needles have returned to Seattle the earth is healing it

05:49.500 --> 05:53.420
actually looks a little bit more like an alien invasion to me to be honest maybe that's what

05:53.420 --> 05:56.820
it actually is though guys or or you know what it's probably something even worse I

05:56.860 --> 06:03.340
think the original Seattle space needle is probably a giant 5g tower causing coronavirus

06:03.340 --> 06:07.900
for the entire world that's what's happening there we go I've solved it pasta is returning

06:07.900 --> 06:12.640
to its native habitat in Tesco nature is healing you know where I am locally we've actually

06:12.640 --> 06:19.140
kind of got past the uh the the shortages stage you can still only buy like two of certain

06:19.140 --> 06:23.160
items in grocery stores but the the shelves are pretty much stocked now like they're they're

06:23.160 --> 06:27.400
okay I actually went to the grocery store yesterday and and the cashiers are wearing

06:27.400 --> 06:32.000
like face shields not just like breathing masks but like the full like like covers your

06:32.000 --> 06:35.560
whole head face shield and there's tape on the ground that says okay make sure to stay

06:35.560 --> 06:38.720
six feet apart from each other etc and it's like okay but I have some acquaintances that

06:38.720 --> 06:42.340
work at the store and I asked them like hey are you guys actually doing anything meaningfully

06:42.340 --> 06:46.480
different like in in the background and they're all like no we're just working as usual because

06:46.480 --> 06:50.200
I mean what's gonna happen right it's like okay yeah fair enough there really does seem

06:50.200 --> 06:54.140
to be more of a perception of a problem than an actual problem at least in some locations

06:54.140 --> 06:58.400
right now because everyone in Italy is quarantined the natural wildlife has returned to the water

06:58.400 --> 07:05.760
and forests we have the virus excuse me this is obviously a faked photo both of those pictures

07:05.760 --> 07:11.400
are of New York style pepperoni pizzas those are not authentic Italian pizzas so obviously

07:11.400 --> 07:16.840
someone set this up wildlife is returning to the Scottish streets nature was what the

07:16.840 --> 07:21.760
fuck is this this just has to be some Scottish thing that I don't get maybe it's just because

07:21.760 --> 07:25.620
I don't know Scottish people have red hair I don't know maybe Dankula can fill me in

07:25.620 --> 07:29.560
or something with everyone on lockdown the trucks have returned to their water holes

07:29.560 --> 07:34.480
oh isn't nature beautiful I wonder what actually happened here like is this just a Photoshop

07:34.480 --> 07:39.380
or did did two trucks actually just drive into the river I've seen more ridiculous things

07:39.380 --> 07:43.680
to be honest I just took this beautiful photo what's actually interesting about this photo

07:43.680 --> 07:46.580
is I don't know if you guys know but this is actually a real picture I know that we

07:46.580 --> 07:51.420
just have it ingrained in our heads now that it's the Windows XP default desktop theme

07:51.420 --> 07:56.860
and it looks very computer-generated of how perfect it is but it actually is a real photo

07:56.860 --> 08:01.220
yeah according to the internet the picture is named bliss and it was originally taken

08:01.220 --> 08:14.780
here this is in California something like take the take these these stats here maybe

08:14.780 --> 08:19.900
plug them into Google Maps and see what I can get and here it is Microsoft Windows XP

08:19.900 --> 08:29.020
background photo site yeah check this out it's going to okay can I I can't Street View

08:29.020 --> 08:39.220
it okay maybe I can just take a look at it from over here yeah okay I could see it this

08:39.220 --> 08:44.140
is definitely the spot okay fair enough fair enough you get you got me good job wildlife

08:44.140 --> 08:49.260
versus her into the city nature is healing as it just blows fire all across Tokyo there's

08:49.260 --> 08:55.220
a period of time I was probably between like 16 and 18 when I was a little bit of an insomniac

08:55.220 --> 08:59.180
and I would actually spend my nights either playing video games which I did quite a bit

08:59.180 --> 09:05.940
or I watched late night TV and what was on late night TV often were really badly translated

09:05.940 --> 09:11.700
Asian movies I actually got to see the clones of Bruce Lee then for the first time it's

09:11.700 --> 09:18.060
a terrible movie however however I did in fact get to see some some Godzilla films and

09:18.060 --> 09:22.020
you know this stuff like this this this cool animatronic stuff or like this cool stop-motion

09:22.020 --> 09:26.020
stuff sometimes it's like people in suits walking around like a set that is obviously

09:26.020 --> 09:30.420
just a bunch of buildings I really have a respect for like this era of filmmaking it's

09:30.420 --> 09:36.380
not the same when they do it in CG you know here's my friend vague commander day 37 women

09:36.380 --> 09:41.620
are returning to the kitchen nature is healing we are the virus and this is from the twitch

09:41.620 --> 09:49.540
stream of one Ava quarantine girlfriend I went to school for philosophy wanting to discover truth

09:49.540 --> 09:57.340
and justice but all I found out was that I was gay and trans I don't know if this qualifies as

09:57.980 --> 10:04.820
women return to the kitchen maybe let's let's watch the video get my old headphones out guys

10:04.820 --> 10:16.740
it's a layer cake it's a layer cake I did it look at that look at that that feel when men

10:16.740 --> 10:22.060
make better women than women but I can't just steal PewDiePie schtick forever it is pretty

10:22.060 --> 10:26.580
fun to just check out the current memes and laugh at their best iterations but it wouldn't

10:26.580 --> 10:33.140
be an SFO video if I didn't try to at least end it with some kind of point or a vision or something

10:33.140 --> 10:38.140
the reason this meme has been relatively successful at least kind of low-key is because of how it's

10:38.140 --> 10:43.580
framed the whole nature is healing we are the virus thing as if human beings aren't part of

10:43.580 --> 10:48.900
nature as if we don't exist alongside it as if we don't deserve a habitat just like every other

10:48.900 --> 10:54.060
creature on the planet does but there's definitely this almost anti-humanist undercurrent but below

10:54.060 --> 10:59.140
it with the whole we are the virus thing as if humanity is the problem the mere existence of

10:59.140 --> 11:03.740
humanity is what is what makes everything terrible and at least in these people's minds I do think

11:03.740 --> 11:07.460
that humanity on the whole is probably a good thing I don't know if that's a controversial

11:07.460 --> 11:12.260
opinion nowadays but it's definitely how I feel even just avoiding any kind of religious arguments

11:12.260 --> 11:18.940
which I am apt to do because I'm an atheist I do think that humanity is probably relatively unique

11:18.940 --> 11:24.540
at least insofar as we know because we are definitely the first time that the universe

11:24.540 --> 11:29.660
has been able to observe itself we are part of the universe we are made up of the same matter that

11:29.660 --> 11:34.620
has always existed and yet we're also cognizant I think that's important I think that's different

11:34.620 --> 11:39.100
and I think it's special I think it's worth preserving and this idea that the planet will

11:39.100 --> 11:43.900
be better off without us it's like better off for who you might make the argument that yeah okay

11:43.900 --> 11:50.340
mankind has done a tremendous number on mother nature but she gets her revenge on us and then

11:50.340 --> 11:56.380
some we all get diseases we all get viruses obviously we all get sick we all die eventually

11:56.380 --> 12:01.420
but if you think back like a year or two ago or even longer to be honest a lot of the the more

12:01.420 --> 12:08.820
extreme climate alarmists were saying that unless humanity completely shuts down everything we are

12:08.820 --> 12:12.580
doomed there will never be another generation of humans we're going to destroy the planet so much

12:12.580 --> 12:16.700
it'll be completely uninhabitable you know I I do definitely believe that climate change is at

12:16.700 --> 12:21.180
least partially man-made but I certainly don't buy the most doomerist of predictions when it comes to

12:21.180 --> 12:27.020
this stuff but still that was always the claim we must shut everything down and the economic cost

12:27.020 --> 12:31.900
be damned well at this point we've done that haven't we we are destroying our own economies

12:31.900 --> 12:36.460
and forcing everyone to stay inside in order to get a handle on the coronavirus and in doing so

12:36.460 --> 12:43.100
worldwide emissions have dropped tremendously and yet global lockdowns might reduce co2 emissions

12:43.100 --> 12:48.380
but won't halt the climate crisis scientists say there's a difference between co2 emissions

12:48.380 --> 12:52.780
and atmospheric concentrations of co2 well what the hell else do you want from us then we have now

12:52.780 --> 12:57.580
unwillingly and not for the reasons that you initially wanted but we have now put into place

12:57.580 --> 13:02.100
all of the recommendations you were looking for and apparently it's still not enough so what else

13:02.100 --> 13:06.660
is there if it just so happens that climate change is irreversible and and I don't think that it is

13:06.660 --> 13:11.580
well then screw it if turning into a complete fascist state where no one is allowed to leave

13:11.580 --> 13:17.500
the house and all economic activity must be stopped using state force is still not enough

13:17.500 --> 13:22.700
then it's not fucking worth it but most importantly I still do think that human ingenuity will solve

13:22.700 --> 13:27.580
this problem you have this line here there's a difference between co2 emissions and atmospheric

13:27.580 --> 13:33.140
concentrations of co2 okay so even if we stop all co2 emissions there's still all that extra co2

13:33.140 --> 13:37.500
floating around on the atmosphere that we already put there and eventually the the plants and the

13:37.500 --> 13:42.340
oceans will absorb that co2 and it'll kind of level out if we all happen to disappear but at

13:42.340 --> 13:46.780
the same time there's still no reason why human ingenuity can't also speed that process along

13:46.780 --> 13:53.660
there are ways to extract co2 from the air and I do have great hope that our cleverness will still

13:53.660 --> 13:59.900
save us yet both in terms of the climate crisis and in terms of coronavirus but in the end the

13:59.900 --> 14:04.700
reason why the climate activists wanted a global lockdown and now that they have one they're saying

14:04.700 --> 14:09.740
that it's not enough is because we can't beat climate change under capitalism socialism is

14:09.740 --> 14:14.180
the only way yes it's never really been about saving the planet it's always been about implementing

14:14.180 --> 14:20.460
socialism that's why AOC's Green New Deal was chock full of socialism that's why other climate

14:20.460 --> 14:26.260
activists always talk about not just the climate the science behind it but also about pushing

14:26.260 --> 14:31.300
social justice bullshit the climate has always been their sneaky backdoor to bringing socialism

14:31.300 --> 14:36.620
about because while there are many good arguments against socialism the honest truth is there's not

14:36.620 --> 14:41.040
that many good arguments against environmentalism truthfully think about it for a minute even if

14:41.040 --> 14:46.620
you don't believe that humanity is causing climate change we still do want the planet to be

14:46.620 --> 14:52.700
inhabitable by humans even if its natural cycles make it so that it's not in the future if that is

14:52.700 --> 14:56.340
the case we should probably work towards keeping things as they are secondly there's still no

14:56.340 --> 15:01.500
problem with cleaning up the environment anyway like okay if you don't believe that climate change

15:01.500 --> 15:05.980
is being caused by co2 emissions that humans are putting out fine you can still believe that all

15:05.980 --> 15:10.420
the plastic in the ocean was put there by humans and didn't just naturally appear there you can

15:10.420 --> 15:14.860
still feel like cleaning up oil spills and rescuing animals from their negative effects

15:14.860 --> 15:19.940
is probably still a good thing and thirdly even if you don't believe in climate change getting off

15:19.940 --> 15:25.380
of foreign oil and starting to use local renewable resources for our energy can only be a good thing

15:25.380 --> 15:30.460
politically so because when you really think about it there's actually not really that much that's

15:30.460 --> 15:35.620
bad about environmentalism that is what they're using to sneak socialism in and of course I

15:35.620 --> 15:40.900
completely disagree with the whole point of this article here it is absolutely possible to be an

15:41.140 --> 15:45.180
environmentalist and a capitalist and of course this is all something that we know very well

15:45.180 --> 15:50.180
because of this this article from last year extinction rebellion isn't about the climate

15:50.180 --> 15:54.580
extinction rebellion by the way it was a radical protest group regarding the climate I don't think

15:54.580 --> 15:58.940
they really exist anymore they kind of had their 15 minutes of fame in 2019 and they died out but

15:58.940 --> 16:04.540
this guy here says yes yes I know the climate is breaking down it's urgent an emergency we only got

16:04.540 --> 16:08.860
a few years left to fix it but extinction rebellion isn't about the climate the climates breakdown is

16:08.860 --> 16:12.620
a symptom of a toxic system that has infected the ways we relate to each other as humans and

16:12.620 --> 16:16.780
to all life this was exacerbated when European civilization was spread around the globe through

16:16.780 --> 16:21.740
cruelty and violence especially over the last 600 years of colonialism although the roots of

16:21.740 --> 16:27.340
the infections go much further back see this is this is all about socialism it is all about

16:27.340 --> 16:34.620
anti-western hatred this is all about post-modernist narcissism the delusion of white supremacy centers

16:34.620 --> 16:38.380
whiteness in the experience of white people the delusion of the patriarchy centers the male

16:38.460 --> 16:42.460
experience the delusions of Eurocentrism and includes the notion that Europeans know what's

16:42.460 --> 16:48.140
best for the listen how does any of this relate to the environment oh it doesn't oh you're just a

16:48.140 --> 16:52.380
fucking Marxist trying to sneak all this shit in the back door get the fuck out of here extinction

16:52.380 --> 16:56.460
rebellion isn't about the climate it's not even about climate justice although that's important

16:56.460 --> 17:00.860
if we only talk about the climate we're missing the deeper problems plaguing our culture for these

17:00.860 --> 17:08.060
people if capitalism actually managed to achieve all of the goals of environmentalism but didn't

17:08.060 --> 17:12.060
implement socialism then it would still be a failure because they don't actually give a

17:12.060 --> 17:16.780
shit about the environment and that's why i enjoy this meme because frankly it makes fun of the way

17:16.780 --> 17:21.900
that these sanctimonious snobs actually feel about the environment they post a picture of a

17:21.900 --> 17:26.460
deer running through their backyard or something they go oh nature is so beautiful humans are so

17:26.460 --> 17:31.100
terrible and it's like fuck off man there are legitimate criticisms to be made regarding our

17:31.100 --> 17:35.660
relationship with the environment but if your analysis of the situation ends with humans being

17:35.660 --> 17:40.860
extinct as a moral good i just don't want to fucking hear it you sound like an absolute lunatic

17:40.860 --> 17:45.660
and the only way i would ever go along with your ideas is if you make yourself extinct first
