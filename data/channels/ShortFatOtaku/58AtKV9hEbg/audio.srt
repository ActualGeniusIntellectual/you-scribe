1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
I guess my channel is going to turn into Pewdiepie's at least for a little bit because I'm actually

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,680
going to do a meme review believe it or not.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,600
This is not the kind of thing I usually do but this is actually somewhat relevant and

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,960
in fact it is a meme that I am really, really enjoying.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,480
Doesn't Pewds have a song for meme review anyway?

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,480
Yeah.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,600
Isn't it like, leave your entries in the subreddit bros.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,640
No wait that's, that's L-W-I-A well you know it's all basically the same show anyway it

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,640
seems like.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,400
It's okay I like Pewdiepie quite a bit.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,580
But anyway, meme review.

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,740
This article popped up about a month ago.

13
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,920
The canals of Venice run clear as coronavirus halts traffic, bringing back the lagoon waters

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,480
of ancient times.

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,280
The popular tourist destination is in lockdown with visitors staying away and residents self-isolating.

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,940
An absence of boats has caused the once turbid waters to clear, revealing fish populations.

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:47,940
Oh that's real cool.

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,660
Yeah and here in the article you got these screenshots where you can see the fish swimming

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,380
around and how clear the waters are.

20
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,980
It's actually kind of neat.

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,900
And in fact the European Space Agency released two pictures, one from recently and one from

22
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,900
about a year ago.

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,900
And you can actually see the difference.

24
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,300
You can actually see how Venice has changed from space.

25
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,220
It's kind of interesting.

26
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,960
And you have other similar events too like this one.

27
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,960
Nature is healing.

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,580
New pollution free world thanks to COVID-19.

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,860
The pyramids in Egypt are now visible from Theca road.

30
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,700
And you know what that would actually be a really breathtaking view to behold yourself.

31
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,580
The point is that there's two phrases nature is healing and we are the virus.

32
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,780
If you search those on Twitter you will get some extreme ridiculousness.

33
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,780
It's pretty awesome.

34
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,860
Sharks are finally enjoying the wilderness now that humans are gone.

35
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,860
We are the virus.

36
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,860
What is this?

37
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,860
Yeah.

38
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:52,820
You know I can't find it anywhere.

39
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,820
Is he going to jump in?

40
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,820
Yep.

41
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,820
Okay.

42
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,940
I can't find the video anymore.

43
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,420
But a few weeks ago there was a video of a guy who was walking around an abandoned city

44
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:11,580
in like a T-Rex like animatronic T-Rex suit and the police were yelling at him.

45
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,300
And it was playing the Jurassic Park theme.

46
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,020
Now that the smog has cleared up we can see Denver all the way from New York.

47
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,020
The earth is healing.

48
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,020
We are the virus.

49
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,820
Oh is that like the halo remastered?

50
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,820
Man that actually looks pretty good.

51
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,020
I wonder if it'd be worth playing on Game Boomers probably honestly.

52
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,020
The earth is healing.

53
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,220
We are the virus.

54
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,340
Don't do it Mr. Bird.

55
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,340
You're going to get lung cancer.

56
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,860
You're going to have a pre-existing condition and COVID will get you.

57
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,580
The Daleks are returning to England.

58
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,900
The world is healing itself.

59
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,180
You know I never liked Doctor Who.

60
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:50,340
Even back during the good seasons people call certain doctors like better doctors than others.

61
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,340
I never understood it.

62
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,340
I never got it.

63
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,340
You know?

64
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,340
I was always more of a Star Trek guy.

65
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,140
Well I mean until recently obviously but still.

66
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,420
This picture was taken downtown just yesterday.

67
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,940
Nature is returning.

68
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,940
We are the virus.

69
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,940
Jesus.

70
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,180
Man the Cats movie really was just nightmarish wasn't it?

71
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,300
And you know they're making a new one too with the same technology.

72
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,900
They're doing like a live-action Robin Hood where it's Robin Hood as like an anthropomorphic

73
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,620
fox furry kind of guy.

74
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,460
You think one box office flop is enough Disney?

75
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,940
Cows are returning to the sea.

76
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,380
Nature is healing.

77
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,620
We are the virus.

78
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,420
How did they get this picture?

79
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,020
That's like a real cow.

80
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,380
They just okay.

81
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,140
For the first time in four generations the headphone jack is returning.

82
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,140
Nature is healing.

83
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,140
We are the virus.

84
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,140
Yeah well you know what?

85
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,740
If you were a big brain like me you'd still be using what I have right here.

86
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:44,980
This this old Galaxy S2 it still has it's from like 2009 or whatever and it still has

87
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,980
the old headphone jack.

88
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,580
Let's listen to these ancient sound effects dude.

89
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:55,580
I don't know I just never felt the need to get a new phone to be honest.

90
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,180
Like this one still works.

91
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,740
I think the text of this one is actually the original text that started the meme.

92
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,460
Here's an unexpected side effect of the pandemic.

93
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:09,580
Since the humans are inside the native wildlife is returning for the first time in years.

94
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,540
Nature is healing and we are the virus.

95
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,620
Now this picture obviously isn't the first picture like like whatever whatever picture

96
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,920
started this meme it was a serious post it's just that this text went viral.

97
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,660
I do like that people are taking the opportunity to dress up like complete idiots in really

98
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,460
weird suits and do things outside.

99
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,300
Crabs are back in the airports.

100
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,300
Nature is healing.

101
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,380
What's this video?

102
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,380
Who flew with crabs?

103
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,180
What is this video?

104
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:42,220
Oh god someone actually put like crabs they put crab someone put like a box full of crabs

105
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:48,020
in in in the luggage in the plane and now they're just all over the place.

106
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,100
Oh my god why why would anyone do this?

107
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,100
I'm kind of half expecting the the crab dance to start playing here and I guess normally

108
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,740
I'd cut that in for a gag but last time I did that I got copyright struck on YouTube

109
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,300
so you'll just have to imagine it I guess.

110
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:14,980
Nature is healing man look at the hips on her damn girl you uh you want to get together

111
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,780
some time and do some photosynthesis together cookies have returned to the sewing kits nature

112
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,920
is healing we are the virus yeah I do have even though I've never actually eaten any

113
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,180
of these cookies before in my life I really don't like them I have about five of these

114
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,700
containers around the house just various things stuck in them just because usually

115
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,640
like my parents were throwing them out I need a container so I'd take one or like they would

116
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,140
give me something that they had that was in a container and now I have it I think I've

117
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,400
actually seen more of these containers with random things in them than with the actual

118
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,500
cookies the rest of the space needles have returned to Seattle the earth is healing it

119
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,420
actually looks a little bit more like an alien invasion to me to be honest maybe that's what

120
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,820
it actually is though guys or or you know what it's probably something even worse I

121
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:03,340
think the original Seattle space needle is probably a giant 5g tower causing coronavirus

122
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,900
for the entire world that's what's happening there we go I've solved it pasta is returning

123
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,640
to its native habitat in Tesco nature is healing you know where I am locally we've actually

124
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:19,140
kind of got past the uh the the shortages stage you can still only buy like two of certain

125
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,160
items in grocery stores but the the shelves are pretty much stocked now like they're they're

126
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,400
okay I actually went to the grocery store yesterday and and the cashiers are wearing

127
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,000
like face shields not just like breathing masks but like the full like like covers your

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,560
whole head face shield and there's tape on the ground that says okay make sure to stay

129
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,720
six feet apart from each other etc and it's like okay but I have some acquaintances that

130
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,340
work at the store and I asked them like hey are you guys actually doing anything meaningfully

131
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,480
different like in in the background and they're all like no we're just working as usual because

132
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,200
I mean what's gonna happen right it's like okay yeah fair enough there really does seem

133
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,140
to be more of a perception of a problem than an actual problem at least in some locations

134
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,400
right now because everyone in Italy is quarantined the natural wildlife has returned to the water

135
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:05,760
and forests we have the virus excuse me this is obviously a faked photo both of those pictures

136
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,400
are of New York style pepperoni pizzas those are not authentic Italian pizzas so obviously

137
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,840
someone set this up wildlife is returning to the Scottish streets nature was what the

138
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,760
fuck is this this just has to be some Scottish thing that I don't get maybe it's just because

139
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,620
I don't know Scottish people have red hair I don't know maybe Dankula can fill me in

140
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,560
or something with everyone on lockdown the trucks have returned to their water holes

141
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,480
oh isn't nature beautiful I wonder what actually happened here like is this just a Photoshop

142
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,380
or did did two trucks actually just drive into the river I've seen more ridiculous things

143
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,680
to be honest I just took this beautiful photo what's actually interesting about this photo

144
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,580
is I don't know if you guys know but this is actually a real picture I know that we

145
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,420
just have it ingrained in our heads now that it's the Windows XP default desktop theme

146
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,860
and it looks very computer-generated of how perfect it is but it actually is a real photo

147
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,220
yeah according to the internet the picture is named bliss and it was originally taken

148
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:14,780
here this is in California something like take the take these these stats here maybe

149
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:19,900
plug them into Google Maps and see what I can get and here it is Microsoft Windows XP

150
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:29,020
background photo site yeah check this out it's going to okay can I I can't Street View

151
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:39,220
it okay maybe I can just take a look at it from over here yeah okay I could see it this

152
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:44,140
is definitely the spot okay fair enough fair enough you get you got me good job wildlife

153
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,260
versus her into the city nature is healing as it just blows fire all across Tokyo there's

154
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:55,220
a period of time I was probably between like 16 and 18 when I was a little bit of an insomniac

155
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,180
and I would actually spend my nights either playing video games which I did quite a bit

156
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:05,940
or I watched late night TV and what was on late night TV often were really badly translated

157
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:11,700
Asian movies I actually got to see the clones of Bruce Lee then for the first time it's

158
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:18,060
a terrible movie however however I did in fact get to see some some Godzilla films and

159
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,020
you know this stuff like this this this cool animatronic stuff or like this cool stop-motion

160
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,020
stuff sometimes it's like people in suits walking around like a set that is obviously

161
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:30,420
just a bunch of buildings I really have a respect for like this era of filmmaking it's

162
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:36,380
not the same when they do it in CG you know here's my friend vague commander day 37 women

163
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,620
are returning to the kitchen nature is healing we are the virus and this is from the twitch

164
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:49,540
stream of one Ava quarantine girlfriend I went to school for philosophy wanting to discover truth

165
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:57,340
and justice but all I found out was that I was gay and trans I don't know if this qualifies as

166
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:04,820
women return to the kitchen maybe let's let's watch the video get my old headphones out guys

167
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:16,740
it's a layer cake it's a layer cake I did it look at that look at that that feel when men

168
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:22,060
make better women than women but I can't just steal PewDiePie schtick forever it is pretty

169
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,580
fun to just check out the current memes and laugh at their best iterations but it wouldn't

170
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:33,140
be an SFO video if I didn't try to at least end it with some kind of point or a vision or something

171
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,140
the reason this meme has been relatively successful at least kind of low-key is because of how it's

172
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:43,580
framed the whole nature is healing we are the virus thing as if human beings aren't part of

173
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,900
nature as if we don't exist alongside it as if we don't deserve a habitat just like every other

174
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:54,060
creature on the planet does but there's definitely this almost anti-humanist undercurrent but below

175
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,140
it with the whole we are the virus thing as if humanity is the problem the mere existence of

176
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,740
humanity is what is what makes everything terrible and at least in these people's minds I do think

177
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,460
that humanity on the whole is probably a good thing I don't know if that's a controversial

178
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:12,260
opinion nowadays but it's definitely how I feel even just avoiding any kind of religious arguments

179
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:18,940
which I am apt to do because I'm an atheist I do think that humanity is probably relatively unique

180
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:24,540
at least insofar as we know because we are definitely the first time that the universe

181
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,660
has been able to observe itself we are part of the universe we are made up of the same matter that

182
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,620
has always existed and yet we're also cognizant I think that's important I think that's different

183
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,100
and I think it's special I think it's worth preserving and this idea that the planet will

184
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,900
be better off without us it's like better off for who you might make the argument that yeah okay

185
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:50,340
mankind has done a tremendous number on mother nature but she gets her revenge on us and then

186
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:56,380
some we all get diseases we all get viruses obviously we all get sick we all die eventually

187
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:01,420
but if you think back like a year or two ago or even longer to be honest a lot of the the more

188
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:08,820
extreme climate alarmists were saying that unless humanity completely shuts down everything we are

189
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,580
doomed there will never be another generation of humans we're going to destroy the planet so much

190
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,700
it'll be completely uninhabitable you know I I do definitely believe that climate change is at

191
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,180
least partially man-made but I certainly don't buy the most doomerist of predictions when it comes to

192
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:27,020
this stuff but still that was always the claim we must shut everything down and the economic cost

193
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,900
be damned well at this point we've done that haven't we we are destroying our own economies

194
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,460
and forcing everyone to stay inside in order to get a handle on the coronavirus and in doing so

195
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:43,100
worldwide emissions have dropped tremendously and yet global lockdowns might reduce co2 emissions

196
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,380
but won't halt the climate crisis scientists say there's a difference between co2 emissions

197
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,780
and atmospheric concentrations of co2 well what the hell else do you want from us then we have now

198
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,580
unwillingly and not for the reasons that you initially wanted but we have now put into place

199
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:02,100
all of the recommendations you were looking for and apparently it's still not enough so what else

200
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,660
is there if it just so happens that climate change is irreversible and and I don't think that it is

201
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,580
well then screw it if turning into a complete fascist state where no one is allowed to leave

202
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:17,500
the house and all economic activity must be stopped using state force is still not enough

203
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,700
then it's not fucking worth it but most importantly I still do think that human ingenuity will solve

204
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,580
this problem you have this line here there's a difference between co2 emissions and atmospheric

205
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:33,140
concentrations of co2 okay so even if we stop all co2 emissions there's still all that extra co2

206
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,500
floating around on the atmosphere that we already put there and eventually the the plants and the

207
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,340
oceans will absorb that co2 and it'll kind of level out if we all happen to disappear but at

208
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,780
the same time there's still no reason why human ingenuity can't also speed that process along

209
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:53,660
there are ways to extract co2 from the air and I do have great hope that our cleverness will still

210
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:59,900
save us yet both in terms of the climate crisis and in terms of coronavirus but in the end the

211
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,700
reason why the climate activists wanted a global lockdown and now that they have one they're saying

212
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,740
that it's not enough is because we can't beat climate change under capitalism socialism is

213
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,180
the only way yes it's never really been about saving the planet it's always been about implementing

214
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:20,460
socialism that's why AOC's Green New Deal was chock full of socialism that's why other climate

215
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:26,260
activists always talk about not just the climate the science behind it but also about pushing

216
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:31,300
social justice bullshit the climate has always been their sneaky backdoor to bringing socialism

217
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,620
about because while there are many good arguments against socialism the honest truth is there's not

218
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,040
that many good arguments against environmentalism truthfully think about it for a minute even if

219
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,620
you don't believe that humanity is causing climate change we still do want the planet to be

220
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:52,700
inhabitable by humans even if its natural cycles make it so that it's not in the future if that is

221
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,340
the case we should probably work towards keeping things as they are secondly there's still no

222
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:01,500
problem with cleaning up the environment anyway like okay if you don't believe that climate change

223
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,980
is being caused by co2 emissions that humans are putting out fine you can still believe that all

224
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,420
the plastic in the ocean was put there by humans and didn't just naturally appear there you can

225
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,860
still feel like cleaning up oil spills and rescuing animals from their negative effects

226
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,940
is probably still a good thing and thirdly even if you don't believe in climate change getting off

227
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:25,380
of foreign oil and starting to use local renewable resources for our energy can only be a good thing

228
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:30,460
politically so because when you really think about it there's actually not really that much that's

229
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:35,620
bad about environmentalism that is what they're using to sneak socialism in and of course I

230
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,900
completely disagree with the whole point of this article here it is absolutely possible to be an

231
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,180
environmentalist and a capitalist and of course this is all something that we know very well

232
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:50,180
because of this this article from last year extinction rebellion isn't about the climate

233
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,580
extinction rebellion by the way it was a radical protest group regarding the climate I don't think

234
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,940
they really exist anymore they kind of had their 15 minutes of fame in 2019 and they died out but

235
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:04,540
this guy here says yes yes I know the climate is breaking down it's urgent an emergency we only got

236
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,860
a few years left to fix it but extinction rebellion isn't about the climate the climates breakdown is

237
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,620
a symptom of a toxic system that has infected the ways we relate to each other as humans and

238
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,780
to all life this was exacerbated when European civilization was spread around the globe through

239
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,740
cruelty and violence especially over the last 600 years of colonialism although the roots of

240
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:27,340
the infections go much further back see this is this is all about socialism it is all about

241
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:34,620
anti-western hatred this is all about post-modernist narcissism the delusion of white supremacy centers

242
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,380
whiteness in the experience of white people the delusion of the patriarchy centers the male

243
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,460
experience the delusions of Eurocentrism and includes the notion that Europeans know what's

244
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:48,140
best for the listen how does any of this relate to the environment oh it doesn't oh you're just a

245
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,380
fucking Marxist trying to sneak all this shit in the back door get the fuck out of here extinction

246
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,460
rebellion isn't about the climate it's not even about climate justice although that's important

247
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,860
if we only talk about the climate we're missing the deeper problems plaguing our culture for these

248
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:08,060
people if capitalism actually managed to achieve all of the goals of environmentalism but didn't

249
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,060
implement socialism then it would still be a failure because they don't actually give a

250
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,780
shit about the environment and that's why i enjoy this meme because frankly it makes fun of the way

251
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,900
that these sanctimonious snobs actually feel about the environment they post a picture of a

252
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,460
deer running through their backyard or something they go oh nature is so beautiful humans are so

253
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:31,100
terrible and it's like fuck off man there are legitimate criticisms to be made regarding our

254
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,660
relationship with the environment but if your analysis of the situation ends with humans being

255
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,860
extinct as a moral good i just don't want to fucking hear it you sound like an absolute lunatic

256
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,660
and the only way i would ever go along with your ideas is if you make yourself extinct first
