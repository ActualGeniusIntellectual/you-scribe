00:00.000 --> 00:10.200
Another E3 has come and gone, and this one was probably the worst I've ever seen.

00:10.200 --> 00:15.160
If you don't know what E3 is, well, I think I explained it in detail in my Politics of

00:15.160 --> 00:19.800
E3 video, but the short version is, every year around this time, video game companies

00:19.800 --> 00:24.600
come together in LA to hold a giant convention called the Electronics Entertainment Expo,

00:24.600 --> 00:27.640
or E3 for short, where they show off what's coming down the pipe.

00:27.640 --> 00:30.360
Or at least that's what it was pre-coronavirus.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.240
Now a lot of it is just done online.

00:32.240 --> 00:36.880
But when there's not a pandemic on, members of the press, as well as YouTubers and streamers

00:36.880 --> 00:40.840
and anybody else who gets an invite, can attend this convention and play demos of games and

00:40.840 --> 00:42.360
sometimes even interview developers.

00:42.360 --> 00:47.800
For the rest of us who don't get to go to E3, it consists mainly of the press conferences.

00:47.800 --> 00:51.240
Now a normal press conference in any other industry is really boring.

00:51.240 --> 00:53.080
It's meant for the press, after all.

00:53.080 --> 00:56.840
It's all about sales figures and projections and graphs that the Zoomer intern whipped

00:56.840 --> 00:59.760
up because of the only one in the company who knows how to use a computer.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.840
But a gaming press conference, that's a whole different story.

01:02.840 --> 01:06.960
They're light shows with pumping music and giant screens where everyone's favorite developers

01:06.960 --> 01:09.020
show up to discuss what their next project is.

01:09.020 --> 01:13.400
And if you're really unlucky, you might get an awful dance number or a celebrity who knows

01:13.400 --> 01:14.920
nothing about video games on the stage.

01:14.920 --> 01:19.800
Yeah, you know, I don't need Elijah Wood woodenly delivering teleprompter lies about the new

01:19.800 --> 01:20.800
Xbox.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.320
You see what I did there?

01:22.320 --> 01:24.420
This was not always the case though.

01:24.420 --> 01:29.580
At one point, gaming press conferences were just like their boring mainstream counterparts.

01:29.580 --> 01:32.220
That changed during E3 1995.

01:32.220 --> 01:34.720
Now this was way back before the internet of today.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.960
Most of us were reading up on E3 through special issues of Nintendo Power like I was.

01:38.960 --> 01:42.460
But thankfully, somebody with a camera in the crowd recorded the whole thing.

01:42.460 --> 01:47.300
After Sega had hyped up the release of their latest Saturn console with a price point of

01:47.300 --> 01:51.660
$399, Sony's press conference consisted of just this.

01:54.420 --> 02:06.420
$299.

02:06.420 --> 02:11.780
Tom Kalinske of Sega was in the audience and said to his co-workers, oh shit at that announcement.

02:11.780 --> 02:15.960
This was the beginning of the end of Sega and nearly the end of Nintendo as the PlayStation

02:15.960 --> 02:18.020
took the top dog spot for a little while.

02:18.020 --> 02:22.400
But more importantly for us, this began the transformation of E3 press conferences from

02:22.400 --> 02:28.920
boring official numbers-focused events, mainly for corporate-facing audiences, into bombastic

02:28.920 --> 02:33.760
shit-talking marketing roundhouses where new games, hardware, and price points are announced

02:33.760 --> 02:35.080
to a lot of fanfare.

02:35.080 --> 02:39.840
VPs of companies began to double as beloved figures by gamers like Phil Spencer of Xbox,

02:39.840 --> 02:44.000
Todd Howard of Bethesda, and Reggie Fils-Aime of Nintendo, and overall the event became

02:44.000 --> 02:47.160
consumer-focused, designed to generate hype among the fans.

02:47.160 --> 02:51.760
E3 would remain in this ultra-fun state for approximately 20 years.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.640
Players genuinely look forward to these events.

02:53.640 --> 02:58.160
Personally, I still fondly remember Reggie showing up at the 2004 E3 to swing his dick

03:28.160 --> 03:58.140
by hand.

03:58.140 --> 04:02.100
People loved to get excited about these events, watch official streams of the conferences,

04:02.100 --> 04:04.700
post on the internet about them from forums to 4chan.

04:04.700 --> 04:09.220
Even when a company had a truly awful showing, like Sony's 2006 conference for example,

04:09.220 --> 04:12.260
they at least turned into memes that we could all enjoy.

04:12.260 --> 04:32.140
The point is, E3 was something special for a lot of us.

04:32.140 --> 04:35.020
The last truly great E3 was 2015.

04:35.020 --> 04:38.860
That was the one where the game trailer guys freaked out over Final Fantasy VII and Shenmue

05:05.020 --> 05:12.660
Yeah, Sony won that year.

05:12.660 --> 05:18.420
I'm bringing all this up because E3 2016 would mark a slow spiral of the event, and not necessarily

05:18.420 --> 05:21.400
because companies would have no games or poor showings.

05:21.400 --> 05:25.380
They certainly sometimes would have those things, but the important part of the conversation

05:25.380 --> 05:28.040
is what they chose to replace the games with.

05:28.040 --> 05:32.860
In the past, a company with not much to show, if they attended E3 at all, would either have

05:32.860 --> 05:35.100
a shorter conference or fill it with fluff.

05:35.100 --> 05:39.100
Nintendo in 2015 comes to mind, the Wii U was a dead system, so they filled the show

05:39.100 --> 05:44.100
with stuff like skits starring puppet versions of Miyamoto, Iwata, and Reggie, or a delicate

05:44.100 --> 05:48.060
look at the original hand-drawn level designs of the first Mario game.

05:48.060 --> 05:51.620
And you know, this stuff is interesting, but it's not new game announcements.

05:51.620 --> 05:55.880
Nowadays, instead of filling it with something that's interesting, they fill it with diversity.

05:55.880 --> 05:59.900
If you watched this year's E3 with me on my twitch channel, you already know this,

05:59.900 --> 06:06.180
E3 2021 was the worst E3 in the history of the event, with 2020 being the second worst,

06:06.180 --> 06:08.820
2019 being the third worst, and so on.

06:08.820 --> 06:12.060
And diversity, woke BS is a big reason for it.

06:12.060 --> 06:16.060
Now it's not the only reason, another big part of it is the shift away to many events

06:16.060 --> 06:17.580
streamed throughout the year.

06:17.580 --> 06:21.580
Nintendo began the trend in 2013, with their Nintendo Direct events happening multiple

06:21.580 --> 06:24.200
times per year, sometimes even once every two months.

06:24.200 --> 06:28.960
Sony followed suit with the state of play, Microsoft with Inside Xbox, and now even smaller

06:28.960 --> 06:30.220
developers are doing them.

06:30.220 --> 06:35.640
In the past, game devs had basically two opportunities to get eyeballs on their new projects, E3

06:35.640 --> 06:37.900
in June, and the Tokyo Game Show in September.

06:37.900 --> 06:41.740
There were some smaller ones like GDC or whatever, but these were the ones that really mattered.

06:41.740 --> 06:44.680
But hey, nowadays, Nintendo has a YouTube channel with 8 million subs.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.400
They can stream their announcements whenever they want.

06:46.400 --> 06:50.240
The convenience of the internet means there's no longer any need to save up announcements

06:50.240 --> 06:51.660
for one giant event.

06:51.660 --> 06:55.980
At the same time, Iwata's declining health during this period also likely made the idea

06:55.980 --> 07:00.300
of digital-only events a lot more appealing, likely kickstarting this trend.

07:00.300 --> 07:02.420
And of course, coronavirus certainly ramped it up.

07:02.420 --> 07:07.440
With more and more small online events, the big ones like E3 either had to shrink in size,

07:07.440 --> 07:11.480
like Nintendo going from several hours to approximately 45 minutes a pop, or padded

07:11.480 --> 07:13.120
out with something.

07:13.120 --> 07:16.260
And nowadays, that something is generally wokeness.

07:16.260 --> 07:22.640
The two biggest culprits are E3 2020's Games for Change virtual convention and E3 2021's

07:22.640 --> 07:24.480
Take Two interactive presentation.

07:24.480 --> 07:29.380
In 2020, the activist group Games for Change held a virtual convention, meaning you'd

07:29.380 --> 07:34.100
go to their website and click various auditoriums, which were a series of streams all being broadcast

07:34.100 --> 07:35.100
at the same time.

07:35.100 --> 07:39.420
And the whole thing was woke, pandering BS about the toxicity of gamers, how hard it

07:39.420 --> 07:42.540
was for a minority in the games industry, you know the drill.

07:42.540 --> 07:46.260
Anita Sarkeesian was even there, and I got banned from her chat asking why she hasn't

07:46.260 --> 07:47.260
paid her employees.

07:47.260 --> 07:49.380
Ah, those are good memories.

07:49.380 --> 07:54.260
In 2021, Take Two interactive booked a slot on E3's official stream.

07:54.260 --> 07:58.440
Take Two being a video game company, we all thought they had games to announce, but instead

07:58.440 --> 08:03.040
we were treated to an hour-long Zoom call about diversity and inclusion, where again,

08:03.040 --> 08:07.120
the talking heads from various activist groups talked about the toxicity of gamers, how hard

08:07.120 --> 08:10.060
it was for a minority in the games industry, etc etc.

08:10.060 --> 08:13.980
At least with Games for Change, it already sounded like something stupid from the get-go.

08:13.980 --> 08:16.440
But Take Two is a video game company.

08:16.440 --> 08:17.800
Where are the fucking games?

08:17.800 --> 08:21.320
Like okay okay, Square Enix's presentation this year sucked balls.

08:21.320 --> 08:25.940
They spent 20 minutes on Marvel games I didn't give a shit about, 10 minutes on Life is Strange,

08:25.940 --> 08:29.860
5 minutes on Mobile Garbage, and 5 minutes on games that actually interested me.

08:29.860 --> 08:31.340
But at least it was all games.

08:31.340 --> 08:35.520
I might not personally like Marvel games, but somebody out there does, and that person

08:35.520 --> 08:40.200
was watching that entirely too long demonstration of Guardians of the Galaxy jizzing their pants

08:40.200 --> 08:41.200
the whole time.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.200
Good for them.

08:42.200 --> 08:45.420
I can at least appreciate that they showed games, even if I didn't like them.

08:45.420 --> 08:46.860
But Take Two showed nothing.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.940
They lectured to their audiences about diversity and inclusion.

08:49.940 --> 08:53.500
Like even if you were to take the politics out of it, like let's say you were actually

08:53.500 --> 08:55.860
pro-woke bullshit for some reason.

08:55.860 --> 08:57.660
Is this the moment where you want to see it?

08:57.660 --> 09:01.240
Maybe you're some pink-haired soy boy who really likes Take Two's games.

09:01.240 --> 09:05.100
Maybe you want to see news in the new Red Dead Redemption or Grand Theft Auto or Bioshock

09:05.100 --> 09:06.100
or something.

09:06.100 --> 09:08.420
And you tune in and end up watching this.

09:08.420 --> 09:12.460
Even if your politics align with these people, you're still going to be disappointed because

09:12.460 --> 09:15.580
they're talking all politics and no games.

09:15.580 --> 09:17.580
This year's E3 had a lot of flubs.

09:17.580 --> 09:21.980
Xbox and Nintendo were the only ones who actually showed off games that gamers wanted to see.

09:21.980 --> 09:23.740
Square Enix gave us a great meme in the form of

09:23.740 --> 09:25.360
Chaos.

09:25.360 --> 09:28.140
We must kill Chaos.

09:28.140 --> 09:31.220
My quest is to kill Chaos.

09:31.220 --> 09:32.220
Chaos will die.

09:32.220 --> 09:34.580
I can't fucking stand Chaos.

09:34.580 --> 09:36.020
He pisses me off.

09:36.020 --> 09:37.240
Chaos won't escape.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.980
Chaos killed my wife and fucked my dog.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.620
Ubisoft presented Gay Dancers for Diversity.

09:42.620 --> 09:47.220
The PC gaming show filled up more airtime with a stupid robot plotline involving the

09:47.220 --> 09:50.020
E-celeb hosts than actual game reveals.

09:50.020 --> 09:53.860
Capcom desperately tried to revive a failing Street Fighter esports scene.

09:53.860 --> 09:57.340
Bandai Namco literally forgot to tell people that their event had ended.

09:57.340 --> 09:58.660
Okay, we'll fight.

09:58.660 --> 10:00.340
Okay, well, we've done it before.

10:00.340 --> 10:01.340
Hold on.

10:01.340 --> 10:02.340
Just a minute.

10:02.340 --> 10:03.340
I'll be a little brother.

10:03.340 --> 10:04.340
Was that it?

10:04.340 --> 10:06.380
Now we're apparently watching Play For All?

10:06.380 --> 10:09.140
Okay, that was supposed to have started seven minutes ago.

10:09.140 --> 10:10.140
Okay.

10:10.140 --> 10:11.140
What are you doing?

10:11.140 --> 10:12.620
You're still watching these cucks.

10:12.620 --> 10:16.060
What are you doing over at IGN?

10:16.060 --> 10:18.780
IGN is Greg Miller, so that's why.

10:18.780 --> 10:19.780
What are you doing?

10:19.780 --> 10:24.740
You're still watching these cucks.

10:24.740 --> 10:26.300
What did we get piped into?

10:26.300 --> 10:28.580
Hey, Dimitri, what have you found?

10:28.580 --> 10:32.020
Wait, is that it?

10:32.020 --> 10:33.020
Wait.

10:33.020 --> 10:35.700
Thank you, Red Eyes Black Dragon.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.140
I appreciate the- That's it.

10:37.140 --> 10:38.140
Good card.

10:38.140 --> 10:39.140
Thank you for showing.

10:39.140 --> 10:41.860
Wait, did it end without us realizing?

10:41.860 --> 10:43.820
I'm streaming too.

10:43.820 --> 10:44.980
Hold on.

10:44.980 --> 10:45.980
Hold on.

10:45.980 --> 10:46.980
Wait, no.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.780
Is this the end of it already?

10:48.780 --> 10:49.780
I'm streaming too.

10:49.780 --> 10:51.780
Thank you again, Red Eyes Black Dragon.

10:51.780 --> 10:52.780
Thank you.

10:52.780 --> 10:54.780
That was it, bro.

10:54.780 --> 10:55.780
Hey, Dev.

10:55.780 --> 10:56.780
Holy shit.

10:56.780 --> 10:57.780
It ended.

10:57.780 --> 10:58.780
Should we do it?

10:58.780 --> 10:59.780
That was it.

10:59.780 --> 11:00.780
Okay.

11:00.780 --> 11:01.780
Thank you for the sub.

11:01.780 --> 11:02.780
I didn't realize it ended.

11:02.780 --> 11:03.780
Where is it?

11:03.780 --> 11:04.780
Oh, my God.

11:04.780 --> 11:05.780
Oh, my God.

11:05.780 --> 11:06.780
Oh, my God.

11:06.780 --> 11:07.780
Oh, my God.

11:07.780 --> 11:08.780
Oh, my God.

11:08.780 --> 11:09.780
Oh, my God.

11:09.780 --> 11:10.780
Oh, my God.

11:10.780 --> 11:11.780
Oh, my God.

11:11.780 --> 11:12.780
Oh, my God.

11:12.780 --> 11:13.780
Oh, my God.

11:14.580 --> 11:15.580
Let's go.

11:15.580 --> 11:17.820
Okay, this is officially the worst E3 ever.

11:17.820 --> 11:21.260
But at least they all involved video games on some level.

11:21.260 --> 11:26.780
These all contributed to E3 being shit, but nothing like Take-Two broadcasting an HR meeting.

11:26.780 --> 11:28.500
Let's say you're a normie watching E3.

11:28.500 --> 11:32.760
Well, okay, normies don't watch E3, but games are becoming a bit more mainstream.

11:32.760 --> 11:37.540
Let's say you're interested in E3, but you don't have time to seek out all the OG conference

11:37.540 --> 11:38.540
feeds like I do.

11:38.540 --> 11:41.300
Let's say you just want to turn it on the background while you work or whatever.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.300
Well, you're in luck.

11:42.300 --> 11:45.700
The official E3 YouTube channel streamed all day for four days.

11:45.700 --> 11:49.340
When the conferences actually happened, they would cut away to high-quality feeds of them,

11:49.340 --> 11:52.620
but they filled in the in-between time with absolute garbage.

11:52.620 --> 11:58.100
Get lectured at by the likes of Anita Sarkeesian, OK Boomer Girl, Egoraptor, and Drag Queen

11:58.100 --> 11:59.100
Story Hour.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.140
Remember 2019's Soy Wars Kid?

12:01.140 --> 12:02.140
Act like it's so nonchalant.

12:02.140 --> 12:03.140
You're making a Star Wars game.

12:03.140 --> 12:06.140
I mean, I think from, you know, go clap and I'm going to stop you.

12:06.140 --> 12:07.140
Keep it going.

12:07.140 --> 12:08.500
They're making a Star Wars game.

12:08.500 --> 12:09.500
Please clap.

12:09.500 --> 12:13.440
It's like Tim responsibly socially distanced from everybody else, sitting on the most uncomfortable

12:13.440 --> 12:14.860
chairs imaginable.

12:14.860 --> 12:19.260
Listen in on Latinx or BIPOC folk describe their video game struggles.

12:19.260 --> 12:26.740
When you're playing like a custom character creator in a game, the character will be black

12:26.740 --> 12:32.340
but have very European-focused features, so it looks like the character's in blackface

12:32.340 --> 12:36.460
and it's not a nice experience for you to have when you're playing the game.

12:36.460 --> 12:39.340
I was literally playing a game yesterday where I created my own character and I literally

12:40.180 --> 12:44.100
just disengaged because I don't like this character, she doesn't really represent me

12:44.100 --> 12:47.000
and she looks weird and the hair is weird and it just feels off.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.080
And that's a game that's recently just come out.

12:49.080 --> 12:51.380
So we still have a lot of work to do in this space.

12:51.380 --> 12:56.100
A lot of people online right now are declaring E3 to be dead and yeah, it's not looking too

12:56.100 --> 12:57.100
good.

12:57.100 --> 13:00.100
They're also declaring video games to be dead, but I don't know about that.

13:00.100 --> 13:04.640
I do think that E3 is a shell of its former self, but its content hasn't died.

13:04.640 --> 13:08.300
It's simply in the process of shifting location, kind of like how real learning no longer takes

13:08.300 --> 13:09.860
place at schools or universities.

13:09.860 --> 13:14.500
The Guerrilla Collective and Summer Games Fest events took place before E3 and while

13:14.500 --> 13:17.920
they were kind of cringey and certainly had some woke talking points, guess what else

13:17.920 --> 13:18.920
they had?

13:18.920 --> 13:19.920
Games!

13:19.920 --> 13:21.280
Over a hundred video games!

13:21.280 --> 13:24.500
Some of the most interesting looking games coming this year were announced at events

13:24.500 --> 13:26.620
happening before E3 even started.

13:26.620 --> 13:31.420
I did a video a few weeks ago about my problems with the get woke, go broke hypothesis and

13:31.420 --> 13:34.400
my main contention with it is that it's not a universal thing.

13:34.400 --> 13:38.320
Wokeness is a heavy indicator that something is going to be shit, but it's certainly possible

13:38.320 --> 13:41.720
to have something that's simultaneously good and still woke, especially when it comes to

13:41.720 --> 13:42.720
video games.

13:42.720 --> 13:46.940
A woke video game can still have good art and music and controls and level design.

13:46.940 --> 13:51.360
The issue is that if something is bad, wokeness is often the cover up tactic.

13:51.360 --> 13:55.380
If you don't like our shitty movie filled with queef jokes, you're a fascist!

13:55.380 --> 14:00.480
But after seeing E3 this year, I think I have to tack on an addendum to that thesis.

14:00.480 --> 14:04.080
The get woke, go broke phenomenon doesn't destroy talent.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.200
It simply shifts it to a new location.

14:06.200 --> 14:10.200
Disney might own Star Wars, but the people who made Star Wars good have moved on.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.420
That does mean that there's a higher chance for Star Wars to be shit, sure, but it also

14:13.420 --> 14:16.780
means that those people are now somewhere else doing something else, and there's a good

14:16.780 --> 14:18.580
chance those new projects are good too.

14:18.580 --> 14:19.880
Same with video games.

14:19.880 --> 14:24.200
BioWare staff have all cycled out, and so Mass Effect Andromeda was a living nightmare,

14:24.200 --> 14:27.240
but those people are now doing their own thing in different studios.

14:27.240 --> 14:30.840
YouTube was once a community, now it's a TV channel, and Bitchute has taken up the mantle

14:30.840 --> 14:34.440
of a fun, unregulated video site that YouTube abandoned years ago.

14:34.440 --> 14:38.020
Awesome Games Done Quick used to be the premier speedrunning event.

14:38.020 --> 14:43.460
Now it's filled with woke activist garbage, and jokes about, uh, trans dilator stations

14:43.460 --> 14:44.460
for some reason.

14:44.460 --> 14:45.460
I don't quite get that one.

14:45.460 --> 14:48.720
But that doesn't mean that speedrunning is dead, it just means that the forefront of

14:48.720 --> 14:52.300
the speedrunning community is taking place somewhere else right now, and the same goes

14:52.300 --> 14:53.300
for E3.

14:53.300 --> 14:56.740
E3 was once a fun event, but nowadays it's like the Zombie Simpsons.

14:56.740 --> 14:59.420
That doesn't mean that quality itself has been destroyed.

14:59.420 --> 15:04.220
The magic that made E3 what it was will resurface in some form somewhere else down the line.

15:04.220 --> 15:07.400
Good games are still being made, they're just not being made in the same place.

15:07.400 --> 15:10.840
Nannying progs will always attempt to take over communities others have built, but they

15:10.840 --> 15:15.600
will never actually be on the advancing edge themselves, creating that new wild west, where

15:15.600 --> 15:19.560
real innovation is happening, where real fun is being had.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.720
That's us, and that process is already underway.

15:21.720 --> 15:25.920
So if you ever despair at this commonly held notion that leftists are taking over everything,

15:25.920 --> 15:28.580
I gotta remind you, it's always been this way.

15:28.580 --> 15:32.120
The ideal has always been a shifting, moving target.

15:32.120 --> 15:37.000
Human structures built to capture that ideal always end up decaying as it moves on, and

15:37.000 --> 15:39.120
you just gotta start looking for the good stuff again.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.120
It's out there.

15:40.120 --> 15:41.120
Believe me.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.920
Anyway, E3 still sucks, I'm gonna continue hate watching it until it dies, because I

15:43.920 --> 15:47.720
personally love a good trainwreck, but there are real games that came out of E3 for sure.

15:47.720 --> 15:51.620
I'm gonna stream a bunch of demos on Twitch shortly after this video drops, so hit up

15:51.620 --> 15:55.120
twitch.tv slash game boomers if you're watching this on release.

15:55.120 --> 15:58.300
And if you're not, hit it up anyway, because I stream there almost every night.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.320
I'll see you there.

15:59.320 --> 16:00.600
Alright, that about does it for me.

16:00.600 --> 16:01.600
I'll see you later.

16:01.600 --> 16:02.100
I love you.
