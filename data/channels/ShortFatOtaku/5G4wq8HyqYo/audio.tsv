0	10200	Another E3 has come and gone, and this one was probably the worst I've ever seen.
10200	15160	If you don't know what E3 is, well, I think I explained it in detail in my Politics of
15160	19800	E3 video, but the short version is, every year around this time, video game companies
19800	24600	come together in LA to hold a giant convention called the Electronics Entertainment Expo,
24600	27640	or E3 for short, where they show off what's coming down the pipe.
27640	30360	Or at least that's what it was pre-coronavirus.
30360	32240	Now a lot of it is just done online.
32240	36880	But when there's not a pandemic on, members of the press, as well as YouTubers and streamers
36880	40840	and anybody else who gets an invite, can attend this convention and play demos of games and
40840	42360	sometimes even interview developers.
42360	47800	For the rest of us who don't get to go to E3, it consists mainly of the press conferences.
47800	51240	Now a normal press conference in any other industry is really boring.
51240	53080	It's meant for the press, after all.
53080	56840	It's all about sales figures and projections and graphs that the Zoomer intern whipped
56840	59760	up because of the only one in the company who knows how to use a computer.
59760	62840	But a gaming press conference, that's a whole different story.
62840	66960	They're light shows with pumping music and giant screens where everyone's favorite developers
66960	69020	show up to discuss what their next project is.
69020	73400	And if you're really unlucky, you might get an awful dance number or a celebrity who knows
73400	74920	nothing about video games on the stage.
74920	79800	Yeah, you know, I don't need Elijah Wood woodenly delivering teleprompter lies about the new
79800	80800	Xbox.
80800	82320	You see what I did there?
82320	84420	This was not always the case though.
84420	89580	At one point, gaming press conferences were just like their boring mainstream counterparts.
89580	92220	That changed during E3 1995.
92220	94720	Now this was way back before the internet of today.
94720	98960	Most of us were reading up on E3 through special issues of Nintendo Power like I was.
98960	102460	But thankfully, somebody with a camera in the crowd recorded the whole thing.
102460	107300	After Sega had hyped up the release of their latest Saturn console with a price point of
107300	111660	$399, Sony's press conference consisted of just this.
114420	126420	$299.
126420	131780	Tom Kalinske of Sega was in the audience and said to his co-workers, oh shit at that announcement.
131780	135960	This was the beginning of the end of Sega and nearly the end of Nintendo as the PlayStation
135960	138020	took the top dog spot for a little while.
138020	142400	But more importantly for us, this began the transformation of E3 press conferences from
142400	148920	boring official numbers-focused events, mainly for corporate-facing audiences, into bombastic
148920	153760	shit-talking marketing roundhouses where new games, hardware, and price points are announced
153760	155080	to a lot of fanfare.
155080	159840	VPs of companies began to double as beloved figures by gamers like Phil Spencer of Xbox,
159840	164000	Todd Howard of Bethesda, and Reggie Fils-Aime of Nintendo, and overall the event became
164000	167160	consumer-focused, designed to generate hype among the fans.
167160	171760	E3 would remain in this ultra-fun state for approximately 20 years.
171760	173640	Players genuinely look forward to these events.
173640	178160	Personally, I still fondly remember Reggie showing up at the 2004 E3 to swing his dick
208160	238140	by hand.
238140	242100	People loved to get excited about these events, watch official streams of the conferences,
242100	244700	post on the internet about them from forums to 4chan.
244700	249220	Even when a company had a truly awful showing, like Sony's 2006 conference for example,
249220	252260	they at least turned into memes that we could all enjoy.
252260	272140	The point is, E3 was something special for a lot of us.
272140	275020	The last truly great E3 was 2015.
275020	278860	That was the one where the game trailer guys freaked out over Final Fantasy VII and Shenmue
305020	312660	Yeah, Sony won that year.
312660	318420	I'm bringing all this up because E3 2016 would mark a slow spiral of the event, and not necessarily
318420	321400	because companies would have no games or poor showings.
321400	325380	They certainly sometimes would have those things, but the important part of the conversation
325380	328040	is what they chose to replace the games with.
328040	332860	In the past, a company with not much to show, if they attended E3 at all, would either have
332860	335100	a shorter conference or fill it with fluff.
335100	339100	Nintendo in 2015 comes to mind, the Wii U was a dead system, so they filled the show
339100	344100	with stuff like skits starring puppet versions of Miyamoto, Iwata, and Reggie, or a delicate
344100	348060	look at the original hand-drawn level designs of the first Mario game.
348060	351620	And you know, this stuff is interesting, but it's not new game announcements.
351620	355880	Nowadays, instead of filling it with something that's interesting, they fill it with diversity.
355880	359900	If you watched this year's E3 with me on my twitch channel, you already know this,
359900	366180	E3 2021 was the worst E3 in the history of the event, with 2020 being the second worst,
366180	368820	2019 being the third worst, and so on.
368820	372060	And diversity, woke BS is a big reason for it.
372060	376060	Now it's not the only reason, another big part of it is the shift away to many events
376060	377580	streamed throughout the year.
377580	381580	Nintendo began the trend in 2013, with their Nintendo Direct events happening multiple
381580	384200	times per year, sometimes even once every two months.
384200	388960	Sony followed suit with the state of play, Microsoft with Inside Xbox, and now even smaller
388960	390220	developers are doing them.
390220	395640	In the past, game devs had basically two opportunities to get eyeballs on their new projects, E3
395640	397900	in June, and the Tokyo Game Show in September.
397900	401740	There were some smaller ones like GDC or whatever, but these were the ones that really mattered.
401740	404680	But hey, nowadays, Nintendo has a YouTube channel with 8 million subs.
404680	406400	They can stream their announcements whenever they want.
406400	410240	The convenience of the internet means there's no longer any need to save up announcements
410240	411660	for one giant event.
411660	415980	At the same time, Iwata's declining health during this period also likely made the idea
415980	420300	of digital-only events a lot more appealing, likely kickstarting this trend.
420300	422420	And of course, coronavirus certainly ramped it up.
422420	427440	With more and more small online events, the big ones like E3 either had to shrink in size,
427440	431480	like Nintendo going from several hours to approximately 45 minutes a pop, or padded
431480	433120	out with something.
433120	436260	And nowadays, that something is generally wokeness.
436260	442640	The two biggest culprits are E3 2020's Games for Change virtual convention and E3 2021's
442640	444480	Take Two interactive presentation.
444480	449380	In 2020, the activist group Games for Change held a virtual convention, meaning you'd
449380	454100	go to their website and click various auditoriums, which were a series of streams all being broadcast
454100	455100	at the same time.
455100	459420	And the whole thing was woke, pandering BS about the toxicity of gamers, how hard it
459420	462540	was for a minority in the games industry, you know the drill.
462540	466260	Anita Sarkeesian was even there, and I got banned from her chat asking why she hasn't
466260	467260	paid her employees.
467260	469380	Ah, those are good memories.
469380	474260	In 2021, Take Two interactive booked a slot on E3's official stream.
474260	478440	Take Two being a video game company, we all thought they had games to announce, but instead
478440	483040	we were treated to an hour-long Zoom call about diversity and inclusion, where again,
483040	487120	the talking heads from various activist groups talked about the toxicity of gamers, how hard
487120	490060	it was for a minority in the games industry, etc etc.
490060	493980	At least with Games for Change, it already sounded like something stupid from the get-go.
493980	496440	But Take Two is a video game company.
496440	497800	Where are the fucking games?
497800	501320	Like okay okay, Square Enix's presentation this year sucked balls.
501320	505940	They spent 20 minutes on Marvel games I didn't give a shit about, 10 minutes on Life is Strange,
505940	509860	5 minutes on Mobile Garbage, and 5 minutes on games that actually interested me.
509860	511340	But at least it was all games.
511340	515520	I might not personally like Marvel games, but somebody out there does, and that person
515520	520200	was watching that entirely too long demonstration of Guardians of the Galaxy jizzing their pants
520200	521200	the whole time.
521200	522200	Good for them.
522200	525420	I can at least appreciate that they showed games, even if I didn't like them.
525420	526860	But Take Two showed nothing.
526860	529940	They lectured to their audiences about diversity and inclusion.
529940	533500	Like even if you were to take the politics out of it, like let's say you were actually
533500	535860	pro-woke bullshit for some reason.
535860	537660	Is this the moment where you want to see it?
537660	541240	Maybe you're some pink-haired soy boy who really likes Take Two's games.
541240	545100	Maybe you want to see news in the new Red Dead Redemption or Grand Theft Auto or Bioshock
545100	546100	or something.
546100	548420	And you tune in and end up watching this.
548420	552460	Even if your politics align with these people, you're still going to be disappointed because
552460	555580	they're talking all politics and no games.
555580	557580	This year's E3 had a lot of flubs.
557580	561980	Xbox and Nintendo were the only ones who actually showed off games that gamers wanted to see.
561980	563740	Square Enix gave us a great meme in the form of
563740	565360	Chaos.
565360	568140	We must kill Chaos.
568140	571220	My quest is to kill Chaos.
571220	572220	Chaos will die.
572220	574580	I can't fucking stand Chaos.
574580	576020	He pisses me off.
576020	577240	Chaos won't escape.
577240	579980	Chaos killed my wife and fucked my dog.
579980	582620	Ubisoft presented Gay Dancers for Diversity.
582620	587220	The PC gaming show filled up more airtime with a stupid robot plotline involving the
587220	590020	E-celeb hosts than actual game reveals.
590020	593860	Capcom desperately tried to revive a failing Street Fighter esports scene.
593860	597340	Bandai Namco literally forgot to tell people that their event had ended.
597340	598660	Okay, we'll fight.
598660	600340	Okay, well, we've done it before.
600340	601340	Hold on.
601340	602340	Just a minute.
602340	603340	I'll be a little brother.
603340	604340	Was that it?
604340	606380	Now we're apparently watching Play For All?
606380	609140	Okay, that was supposed to have started seven minutes ago.
609140	610140	Okay.
610140	611140	What are you doing?
611140	612620	You're still watching these cucks.
612620	616060	What are you doing over at IGN?
616060	618780	IGN is Greg Miller, so that's why.
618780	619780	What are you doing?
619780	624740	You're still watching these cucks.
624740	626300	What did we get piped into?
626300	628580	Hey, Dimitri, what have you found?
628580	632020	Wait, is that it?
632020	633020	Wait.
633020	635700	Thank you, Red Eyes Black Dragon.
635700	637140	I appreciate the- That's it.
637140	638140	Good card.
638140	639140	Thank you for showing.
639140	641860	Wait, did it end without us realizing?
641860	643820	I'm streaming too.
643820	644980	Hold on.
644980	645980	Hold on.
645980	646980	Wait, no.
646980	648780	Is this the end of it already?
648780	649780	I'm streaming too.
649780	651780	Thank you again, Red Eyes Black Dragon.
651780	652780	Thank you.
652780	654780	That was it, bro.
654780	655780	Hey, Dev.
655780	656780	Holy shit.
656780	657780	It ended.
657780	658780	Should we do it?
658780	659780	That was it.
659780	660780	Okay.
660780	661780	Thank you for the sub.
661780	662780	I didn't realize it ended.
662780	663780	Where is it?
663780	664780	Oh, my God.
664780	665780	Oh, my God.
665780	666780	Oh, my God.
666780	667780	Oh, my God.
667780	668780	Oh, my God.
668780	669780	Oh, my God.
669780	670780	Oh, my God.
670780	671780	Oh, my God.
671780	672780	Oh, my God.
672780	673780	Oh, my God.
674580	675580	Let's go.
675580	677820	Okay, this is officially the worst E3 ever.
677820	681260	But at least they all involved video games on some level.
681260	686780	These all contributed to E3 being shit, but nothing like Take-Two broadcasting an HR meeting.
686780	688500	Let's say you're a normie watching E3.
688500	692760	Well, okay, normies don't watch E3, but games are becoming a bit more mainstream.
692760	697540	Let's say you're interested in E3, but you don't have time to seek out all the OG conference
697540	698540	feeds like I do.
698540	701300	Let's say you just want to turn it on the background while you work or whatever.
701300	702300	Well, you're in luck.
702300	705700	The official E3 YouTube channel streamed all day for four days.
705700	709340	When the conferences actually happened, they would cut away to high-quality feeds of them,
709340	712620	but they filled in the in-between time with absolute garbage.
712620	718100	Get lectured at by the likes of Anita Sarkeesian, OK Boomer Girl, Egoraptor, and Drag Queen
718100	719100	Story Hour.
719100	721140	Remember 2019's Soy Wars Kid?
721140	722140	Act like it's so nonchalant.
722140	723140	You're making a Star Wars game.
723140	726140	I mean, I think from, you know, go clap and I'm going to stop you.
726140	727140	Keep it going.
727140	728500	They're making a Star Wars game.
728500	729500	Please clap.
729500	733440	It's like Tim responsibly socially distanced from everybody else, sitting on the most uncomfortable
733440	734860	chairs imaginable.
734860	739260	Listen in on Latinx or BIPOC folk describe their video game struggles.
739260	746740	When you're playing like a custom character creator in a game, the character will be black
746740	752340	but have very European-focused features, so it looks like the character's in blackface
752340	756460	and it's not a nice experience for you to have when you're playing the game.
756460	759340	I was literally playing a game yesterday where I created my own character and I literally
760180	764100	just disengaged because I don't like this character, she doesn't really represent me
764100	767000	and she looks weird and the hair is weird and it just feels off.
767000	769080	And that's a game that's recently just come out.
769080	771380	So we still have a lot of work to do in this space.
771380	776100	A lot of people online right now are declaring E3 to be dead and yeah, it's not looking too
776100	777100	good.
777100	780100	They're also declaring video games to be dead, but I don't know about that.
780100	784640	I do think that E3 is a shell of its former self, but its content hasn't died.
784640	788300	It's simply in the process of shifting location, kind of like how real learning no longer takes
788300	789860	place at schools or universities.
789860	794500	The Guerrilla Collective and Summer Games Fest events took place before E3 and while
794500	797920	they were kind of cringey and certainly had some woke talking points, guess what else
797920	798920	they had?
798920	799920	Games!
799920	801280	Over a hundred video games!
801280	804500	Some of the most interesting looking games coming this year were announced at events
804500	806620	happening before E3 even started.
806620	811420	I did a video a few weeks ago about my problems with the get woke, go broke hypothesis and
811420	814400	my main contention with it is that it's not a universal thing.
814400	818320	Wokeness is a heavy indicator that something is going to be shit, but it's certainly possible
818320	821720	to have something that's simultaneously good and still woke, especially when it comes to
821720	822720	video games.
822720	826940	A woke video game can still have good art and music and controls and level design.
826940	831360	The issue is that if something is bad, wokeness is often the cover up tactic.
831360	835380	If you don't like our shitty movie filled with queef jokes, you're a fascist!
835380	840480	But after seeing E3 this year, I think I have to tack on an addendum to that thesis.
840480	844080	The get woke, go broke phenomenon doesn't destroy talent.
844080	846200	It simply shifts it to a new location.
846200	850200	Disney might own Star Wars, but the people who made Star Wars good have moved on.
850200	853420	That does mean that there's a higher chance for Star Wars to be shit, sure, but it also
853420	856780	means that those people are now somewhere else doing something else, and there's a good
856780	858580	chance those new projects are good too.
858580	859880	Same with video games.
859880	864200	BioWare staff have all cycled out, and so Mass Effect Andromeda was a living nightmare,
864200	867240	but those people are now doing their own thing in different studios.
867240	870840	YouTube was once a community, now it's a TV channel, and Bitchute has taken up the mantle
870840	874440	of a fun, unregulated video site that YouTube abandoned years ago.
874440	878020	Awesome Games Done Quick used to be the premier speedrunning event.
878020	883460	Now it's filled with woke activist garbage, and jokes about, uh, trans dilator stations
883460	884460	for some reason.
884460	885460	I don't quite get that one.
885460	888720	But that doesn't mean that speedrunning is dead, it just means that the forefront of
888720	892300	the speedrunning community is taking place somewhere else right now, and the same goes
892300	893300	for E3.
893300	896740	E3 was once a fun event, but nowadays it's like the Zombie Simpsons.
896740	899420	That doesn't mean that quality itself has been destroyed.
899420	904220	The magic that made E3 what it was will resurface in some form somewhere else down the line.
904220	907400	Good games are still being made, they're just not being made in the same place.
907400	910840	Nannying progs will always attempt to take over communities others have built, but they
910840	915600	will never actually be on the advancing edge themselves, creating that new wild west, where
915600	919560	real innovation is happening, where real fun is being had.
919560	921720	That's us, and that process is already underway.
921720	925920	So if you ever despair at this commonly held notion that leftists are taking over everything,
925920	928580	I gotta remind you, it's always been this way.
928580	932120	The ideal has always been a shifting, moving target.
932120	937000	Human structures built to capture that ideal always end up decaying as it moves on, and
937000	939120	you just gotta start looking for the good stuff again.
939120	940120	It's out there.
940120	941120	Believe me.
941120	943920	Anyway, E3 still sucks, I'm gonna continue hate watching it until it dies, because I
943920	947720	personally love a good trainwreck, but there are real games that came out of E3 for sure.
947720	951620	I'm gonna stream a bunch of demos on Twitch shortly after this video drops, so hit up
951620	955120	twitch.tv slash game boomers if you're watching this on release.
955120	958300	And if you're not, hit it up anyway, because I stream there almost every night.
958320	959320	I'll see you there.
959320	960600	Alright, that about does it for me.
960600	961600	I'll see you later.
961600	962100	I love you.
