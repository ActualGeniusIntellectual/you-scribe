1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
Another E3 has come and gone, and this one was probably the worst I've ever seen.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,160
If you don't know what E3 is, well, I think I explained it in detail in my Politics of

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,800
E3 video, but the short version is, every year around this time, video game companies

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,600
come together in LA to hold a giant convention called the Electronics Entertainment Expo,

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,640
or E3 for short, where they show off what's coming down the pipe.

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,360
Or at least that's what it was pre-coronavirus.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,240
Now a lot of it is just done online.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,880
But when there's not a pandemic on, members of the press, as well as YouTubers and streamers

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,840
and anybody else who gets an invite, can attend this convention and play demos of games and

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,360
sometimes even interview developers.

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,800
For the rest of us who don't get to go to E3, it consists mainly of the press conferences.

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,240
Now a normal press conference in any other industry is really boring.

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,080
It's meant for the press, after all.

14
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,840
It's all about sales figures and projections and graphs that the Zoomer intern whipped

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,760
up because of the only one in the company who knows how to use a computer.

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,840
But a gaming press conference, that's a whole different story.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,960
They're light shows with pumping music and giant screens where everyone's favorite developers

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,020
show up to discuss what their next project is.

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,400
And if you're really unlucky, you might get an awful dance number or a celebrity who knows

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,920
nothing about video games on the stage.

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,800
Yeah, you know, I don't need Elijah Wood woodenly delivering teleprompter lies about the new

22
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
Xbox.

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,320
You see what I did there?

24
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,420
This was not always the case though.

25
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,580
At one point, gaming press conferences were just like their boring mainstream counterparts.

26
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,220
That changed during E3 1995.

27
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,720
Now this was way back before the internet of today.

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,960
Most of us were reading up on E3 through special issues of Nintendo Power like I was.

29
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,460
But thankfully, somebody with a camera in the crowd recorded the whole thing.

30
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,300
After Sega had hyped up the release of their latest Saturn console with a price point of

31
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,660
$399, Sony's press conference consisted of just this.

32
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:06,420
$299.

33
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,780
Tom Kalinske of Sega was in the audience and said to his co-workers, oh shit at that announcement.

34
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,960
This was the beginning of the end of Sega and nearly the end of Nintendo as the PlayStation

35
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,020
took the top dog spot for a little while.

36
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,400
But more importantly for us, this began the transformation of E3 press conferences from

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,920
boring official numbers-focused events, mainly for corporate-facing audiences, into bombastic

38
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,760
shit-talking marketing roundhouses where new games, hardware, and price points are announced

39
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,080
to a lot of fanfare.

40
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,840
VPs of companies began to double as beloved figures by gamers like Phil Spencer of Xbox,

41
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,000
Todd Howard of Bethesda, and Reggie Fils-Aime of Nintendo, and overall the event became

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,160
consumer-focused, designed to generate hype among the fans.

43
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,760
E3 would remain in this ultra-fun state for approximately 20 years.

44
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,640
Players genuinely look forward to these events.

45
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,160
Personally, I still fondly remember Reggie showing up at the 2004 E3 to swing his dick

46
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:58,140
by hand.

47
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,100
People loved to get excited about these events, watch official streams of the conferences,

48
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,700
post on the internet about them from forums to 4chan.

49
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,220
Even when a company had a truly awful showing, like Sony's 2006 conference for example,

50
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,260
they at least turned into memes that we could all enjoy.

51
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:32,140
The point is, E3 was something special for a lot of us.

52
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,020
The last truly great E3 was 2015.

53
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,860
That was the one where the game trailer guys freaked out over Final Fantasy VII and Shenmue

54
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:12,660
Yeah, Sony won that year.

55
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,420
I'm bringing all this up because E3 2016 would mark a slow spiral of the event, and not necessarily

56
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,400
because companies would have no games or poor showings.

57
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,380
They certainly sometimes would have those things, but the important part of the conversation

58
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,040
is what they chose to replace the games with.

59
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,860
In the past, a company with not much to show, if they attended E3 at all, would either have

60
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,100
a shorter conference or fill it with fluff.

61
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,100
Nintendo in 2015 comes to mind, the Wii U was a dead system, so they filled the show

62
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,100
with stuff like skits starring puppet versions of Miyamoto, Iwata, and Reggie, or a delicate

63
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,060
look at the original hand-drawn level designs of the first Mario game.

64
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,620
And you know, this stuff is interesting, but it's not new game announcements.

65
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,880
Nowadays, instead of filling it with something that's interesting, they fill it with diversity.

66
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,900
If you watched this year's E3 with me on my twitch channel, you already know this,

67
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:06,180
E3 2021 was the worst E3 in the history of the event, with 2020 being the second worst,

68
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,820
2019 being the third worst, and so on.

69
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,060
And diversity, woke BS is a big reason for it.

70
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,060
Now it's not the only reason, another big part of it is the shift away to many events

71
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,580
streamed throughout the year.

72
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,580
Nintendo began the trend in 2013, with their Nintendo Direct events happening multiple

73
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,200
times per year, sometimes even once every two months.

74
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,960
Sony followed suit with the state of play, Microsoft with Inside Xbox, and now even smaller

75
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,220
developers are doing them.

76
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:35,640
In the past, game devs had basically two opportunities to get eyeballs on their new projects, E3

77
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,900
in June, and the Tokyo Game Show in September.

78
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,740
There were some smaller ones like GDC or whatever, but these were the ones that really mattered.

79
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,680
But hey, nowadays, Nintendo has a YouTube channel with 8 million subs.

80
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,400
They can stream their announcements whenever they want.

81
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,240
The convenience of the internet means there's no longer any need to save up announcements

82
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,660
for one giant event.

83
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,980
At the same time, Iwata's declining health during this period also likely made the idea

84
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,300
of digital-only events a lot more appealing, likely kickstarting this trend.

85
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,420
And of course, coronavirus certainly ramped it up.

86
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,440
With more and more small online events, the big ones like E3 either had to shrink in size,

87
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,480
like Nintendo going from several hours to approximately 45 minutes a pop, or padded

88
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,120
out with something.

89
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,260
And nowadays, that something is generally wokeness.

90
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:22,640
The two biggest culprits are E3 2020's Games for Change virtual convention and E3 2021's

91
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,480
Take Two interactive presentation.

92
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,380
In 2020, the activist group Games for Change held a virtual convention, meaning you'd

93
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,100
go to their website and click various auditoriums, which were a series of streams all being broadcast

94
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,100
at the same time.

95
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,420
And the whole thing was woke, pandering BS about the toxicity of gamers, how hard it

96
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,540
was for a minority in the games industry, you know the drill.

97
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,260
Anita Sarkeesian was even there, and I got banned from her chat asking why she hasn't

98
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,260
paid her employees.

99
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,380
Ah, those are good memories.

100
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,260
In 2021, Take Two interactive booked a slot on E3's official stream.

101
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,440
Take Two being a video game company, we all thought they had games to announce, but instead

102
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,040
we were treated to an hour-long Zoom call about diversity and inclusion, where again,

103
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,120
the talking heads from various activist groups talked about the toxicity of gamers, how hard

104
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,060
it was for a minority in the games industry, etc etc.

105
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,980
At least with Games for Change, it already sounded like something stupid from the get-go.

106
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,440
But Take Two is a video game company.

107
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,800
Where are the fucking games?

108
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,320
Like okay okay, Square Enix's presentation this year sucked balls.

109
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,940
They spent 20 minutes on Marvel games I didn't give a shit about, 10 minutes on Life is Strange,

110
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,860
5 minutes on Mobile Garbage, and 5 minutes on games that actually interested me.

111
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,340
But at least it was all games.

112
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,520
I might not personally like Marvel games, but somebody out there does, and that person

113
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,200
was watching that entirely too long demonstration of Guardians of the Galaxy jizzing their pants

114
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
the whole time.

115
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Good for them.

116
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,420
I can at least appreciate that they showed games, even if I didn't like them.

117
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,860
But Take Two showed nothing.

118
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,940
They lectured to their audiences about diversity and inclusion.

119
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,500
Like even if you were to take the politics out of it, like let's say you were actually

120
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,860
pro-woke bullshit for some reason.

121
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,660
Is this the moment where you want to see it?

122
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,240
Maybe you're some pink-haired soy boy who really likes Take Two's games.

123
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,100
Maybe you want to see news in the new Red Dead Redemption or Grand Theft Auto or Bioshock

124
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
or something.

125
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,420
And you tune in and end up watching this.

126
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,460
Even if your politics align with these people, you're still going to be disappointed because

127
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,580
they're talking all politics and no games.

128
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,580
This year's E3 had a lot of flubs.

129
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,980
Xbox and Nintendo were the only ones who actually showed off games that gamers wanted to see.

130
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,740
Square Enix gave us a great meme in the form of

131
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,360
Chaos.

132
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,140
We must kill Chaos.

133
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,220
My quest is to kill Chaos.

134
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,220
Chaos will die.

135
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,580
I can't fucking stand Chaos.

136
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,020
He pisses me off.

137
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,240
Chaos won't escape.

138
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,980
Chaos killed my wife and fucked my dog.

139
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,620
Ubisoft presented Gay Dancers for Diversity.

140
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,220
The PC gaming show filled up more airtime with a stupid robot plotline involving the

141
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,020
E-celeb hosts than actual game reveals.

142
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,860
Capcom desperately tried to revive a failing Street Fighter esports scene.

143
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,340
Bandai Namco literally forgot to tell people that their event had ended.

144
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,660
Okay, we'll fight.

145
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,340
Okay, well, we've done it before.

146
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,340
Hold on.

147
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,340
Just a minute.

148
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,340
I'll be a little brother.

149
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,340
Was that it?

150
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,380
Now we're apparently watching Play For All?

151
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,140
Okay, that was supposed to have started seven minutes ago.

152
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,140
Okay.

153
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,140
What are you doing?

154
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,620
You're still watching these cucks.

155
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,060
What are you doing over at IGN?

156
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,780
IGN is Greg Miller, so that's why.

157
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,780
What are you doing?

158
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,740
You're still watching these cucks.

159
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,300
What did we get piped into?

160
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,580
Hey, Dimitri, what have you found?

161
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,020
Wait, is that it?

162
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,020
Wait.

163
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,700
Thank you, Red Eyes Black Dragon.

164
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,140
I appreciate the- That's it.

165
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,140
Good card.

166
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,140
Thank you for showing.

167
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,860
Wait, did it end without us realizing?

168
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,820
I'm streaming too.

169
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,980
Hold on.

170
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,980
Hold on.

171
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,980
Wait, no.

172
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,780
Is this the end of it already?

173
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,780
I'm streaming too.

174
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,780
Thank you again, Red Eyes Black Dragon.

175
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,780
Thank you.

176
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,780
That was it, bro.

177
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,780
Hey, Dev.

178
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,780
Holy shit.

179
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,780
It ended.

180
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,780
Should we do it?

181
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,780
That was it.

182
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,780
Okay.

183
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,780
Thank you for the sub.

184
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,780
I didn't realize it ended.

185
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,780
Where is it?

186
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,780
Oh, my God.

187
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,780
Oh, my God.

188
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,780
Oh, my God.

189
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,780
Oh, my God.

190
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,780
Oh, my God.

191
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,780
Oh, my God.

192
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,780
Oh, my God.

193
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,780
Oh, my God.

194
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,780
Oh, my God.

195
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,780
Oh, my God.

196
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,580
Let's go.

197
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,820
Okay, this is officially the worst E3 ever.

198
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,260
But at least they all involved video games on some level.

199
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:26,780
These all contributed to E3 being shit, but nothing like Take-Two broadcasting an HR meeting.

200
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,500
Let's say you're a normie watching E3.

201
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,760
Well, okay, normies don't watch E3, but games are becoming a bit more mainstream.

202
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,540
Let's say you're interested in E3, but you don't have time to seek out all the OG conference

203
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,540
feeds like I do.

204
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,300
Let's say you just want to turn it on the background while you work or whatever.

205
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,300
Well, you're in luck.

206
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,700
The official E3 YouTube channel streamed all day for four days.

207
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,340
When the conferences actually happened, they would cut away to high-quality feeds of them,

208
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,620
but they filled in the in-between time with absolute garbage.

209
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:58,100
Get lectured at by the likes of Anita Sarkeesian, OK Boomer Girl, Egoraptor, and Drag Queen

210
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,100
Story Hour.

211
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,140
Remember 2019's Soy Wars Kid?

212
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,140
Act like it's so nonchalant.

213
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,140
You're making a Star Wars game.

214
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,140
I mean, I think from, you know, go clap and I'm going to stop you.

215
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,140
Keep it going.

216
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,500
They're making a Star Wars game.

217
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
Please clap.

218
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,440
It's like Tim responsibly socially distanced from everybody else, sitting on the most uncomfortable

219
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,860
chairs imaginable.

220
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,260
Listen in on Latinx or BIPOC folk describe their video game struggles.

221
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:26,740
When you're playing like a custom character creator in a game, the character will be black

222
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:32,340
but have very European-focused features, so it looks like the character's in blackface

223
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,460
and it's not a nice experience for you to have when you're playing the game.

224
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,340
I was literally playing a game yesterday where I created my own character and I literally

225
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,100
just disengaged because I don't like this character, she doesn't really represent me

226
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,000
and she looks weird and the hair is weird and it just feels off.

227
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,080
And that's a game that's recently just come out.

228
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,380
So we still have a lot of work to do in this space.

229
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:56,100
A lot of people online right now are declaring E3 to be dead and yeah, it's not looking too

230
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,100
good.

231
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,100
They're also declaring video games to be dead, but I don't know about that.

232
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,640
I do think that E3 is a shell of its former self, but its content hasn't died.

233
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,300
It's simply in the process of shifting location, kind of like how real learning no longer takes

234
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,860
place at schools or universities.

235
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,500
The Guerrilla Collective and Summer Games Fest events took place before E3 and while

236
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,920
they were kind of cringey and certainly had some woke talking points, guess what else

237
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
they had?

238
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
Games!

239
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,280
Over a hundred video games!

240
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,500
Some of the most interesting looking games coming this year were announced at events

241
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,620
happening before E3 even started.

242
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,420
I did a video a few weeks ago about my problems with the get woke, go broke hypothesis and

243
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,400
my main contention with it is that it's not a universal thing.

244
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,320
Wokeness is a heavy indicator that something is going to be shit, but it's certainly possible

245
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,720
to have something that's simultaneously good and still woke, especially when it comes to

246
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
video games.

247
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,940
A woke video game can still have good art and music and controls and level design.

248
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,360
The issue is that if something is bad, wokeness is often the cover up tactic.

249
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,380
If you don't like our shitty movie filled with queef jokes, you're a fascist!

250
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:00,480
But after seeing E3 this year, I think I have to tack on an addendum to that thesis.

251
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,080
The get woke, go broke phenomenon doesn't destroy talent.

252
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,200
It simply shifts it to a new location.

253
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Disney might own Star Wars, but the people who made Star Wars good have moved on.

254
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,420
That does mean that there's a higher chance for Star Wars to be shit, sure, but it also

255
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,780
means that those people are now somewhere else doing something else, and there's a good

256
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,580
chance those new projects are good too.

257
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,880
Same with video games.

258
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,200
BioWare staff have all cycled out, and so Mass Effect Andromeda was a living nightmare,

259
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,240
but those people are now doing their own thing in different studios.

260
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,840
YouTube was once a community, now it's a TV channel, and Bitchute has taken up the mantle

261
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,440
of a fun, unregulated video site that YouTube abandoned years ago.

262
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,020
Awesome Games Done Quick used to be the premier speedrunning event.

263
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:43,460
Now it's filled with woke activist garbage, and jokes about, uh, trans dilator stations

264
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,460
for some reason.

265
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,460
I don't quite get that one.

266
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,720
But that doesn't mean that speedrunning is dead, it just means that the forefront of

267
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,300
the speedrunning community is taking place somewhere else right now, and the same goes

268
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,300
for E3.

269
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,740
E3 was once a fun event, but nowadays it's like the Zombie Simpsons.

270
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,420
That doesn't mean that quality itself has been destroyed.

271
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,220
The magic that made E3 what it was will resurface in some form somewhere else down the line.

272
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,400
Good games are still being made, they're just not being made in the same place.

273
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,840
Nannying progs will always attempt to take over communities others have built, but they

274
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,600
will never actually be on the advancing edge themselves, creating that new wild west, where

275
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,560
real innovation is happening, where real fun is being had.

276
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,720
That's us, and that process is already underway.

277
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,920
So if you ever despair at this commonly held notion that leftists are taking over everything,

278
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,580
I gotta remind you, it's always been this way.

279
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,120
The ideal has always been a shifting, moving target.

280
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,000
Human structures built to capture that ideal always end up decaying as it moves on, and

281
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,120
you just gotta start looking for the good stuff again.

282
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
It's out there.

283
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
Believe me.

284
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,920
Anyway, E3 still sucks, I'm gonna continue hate watching it until it dies, because I

285
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,720
personally love a good trainwreck, but there are real games that came out of E3 for sure.

286
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,620
I'm gonna stream a bunch of demos on Twitch shortly after this video drops, so hit up

287
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,120
twitch.tv slash game boomers if you're watching this on release.

288
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,300
And if you're not, hit it up anyway, because I stream there almost every night.

289
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
I'll see you there.

290
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,600
Alright, that about does it for me.

291
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
I'll see you later.

292
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,100
I love you.
