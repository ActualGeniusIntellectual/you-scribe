00:00.000 --> 00:05.840
I'm feeling like a broken record at this point. The last like five videos of mine I've had to do

00:05.840 --> 00:12.800
some kind of old man impression. Back in my day politics was like this. But I really do feel the

00:12.800 --> 00:16.800
need to bring up some stuff that's happened before because it's almost like people have just forgotten

00:16.800 --> 00:22.800
about it. Okay so at this point you must have heard the song Scott Pilgrim vs The World Ruined

00:22.800 --> 00:49.920
a Whole Generation of Women, right? By negative XP. He really managed to nail down that generic

00:49.920 --> 00:54.560
90s punk sound. A genre of music I'm really not that interested in. But nonetheless he's got

00:54.560 --> 00:58.720
enough talent to pull it off. The quality of the music isn't what everyone's talking about though,

00:58.720 --> 01:01.040
it's the lyrics.

01:19.920 --> 01:27.040
Haha, don't go throwing stones about the shitty music dude. But this song's wildly popular,

01:27.040 --> 01:32.560
way more popular than anything else negative XP has done. And it is because the lyrics are

01:32.560 --> 01:38.640
describing a certain type of person that would normally be very interested in this sound. Either

01:38.640 --> 01:43.120
the type of woman who would listen to this and really enjoy it, if the lyrics were different

01:43.120 --> 01:47.280
of course, or alternatively the type of man who listened to this kind of stuff in high school

01:47.280 --> 01:51.360
grew out of it and is now having a problem finding an actual girlfriend to settle down with,

01:51.360 --> 01:57.280
because at least some of the girls his age are accurately described by this song. The actual guy

01:57.280 --> 02:02.720
himself, I'm not sure if he's just a memester or if he actually is an MRA, but to be honest it

02:02.720 --> 02:07.680
doesn't really matter. Either way the establishment right now is kind of angry at him for this song.

02:07.680 --> 02:13.280
But wait, what is the establishment anyway? So we're just defending an incel and a sexist

02:13.280 --> 02:16.800
because of my punk culture. You do realize this guy's a serious incel.

02:16.800 --> 02:20.720
You cannot claim to be a part of a culture or subculture if you have no idea what its

02:20.720 --> 02:25.680
roots and values are. Wearing all black does not make you goth. Liking the 70s in drugs

02:25.680 --> 02:30.000
does not make you a hippie. You cannot be a conservative punk. Culture is more than

02:30.000 --> 02:34.880
appearance and interests. Punk cannot literally be right wing shut the fuck up lmao. The whole

02:34.880 --> 02:40.400
point is that it's not. Really? Is that the point? I didn't know that the punk subculture had a

02:40.400 --> 02:45.920
particular political slant. The punk subculture includes a diverse array of ideologies, fashion,

02:45.920 --> 02:51.680
and other forms of expression, visual art, dance, literature, and film. It is largely characterized

02:51.680 --> 02:56.800
by anti-establishment views, the promotion of individual freedom, do-it-yourself ethics,

02:56.800 --> 03:00.800
and is centered on a loud aggressive genre of rock music called punk rock.

03:01.600 --> 03:06.960
Punk politics cover the entire political spectrum. The punk ethos is primarily made up of beliefs

03:07.040 --> 03:13.200
such as nonconformity, anti-authoritarianism, anti-corporatism, a do-it-yourself ethic,

03:13.200 --> 03:19.840
anti-consumerism, anti-corporate greed, direct action, and not selling out. There is a wide array

03:19.840 --> 03:24.640
of punk fashion including deliberately offensive t-shirts, leather jackets, Dr. Martin's boots,

03:25.200 --> 03:30.320
hairstyles such as brightly colored hair and spiked mohawks, cosmetics, tattoos, jewelry,

03:30.320 --> 03:35.760
and body modification. Women in the hardcore scene typically wear masculine clothing.

03:35.760 --> 03:40.560
This definitely sounds like it can describe the left. The anti-corporatism, the direct action,

03:40.560 --> 03:45.840
the not selling out, as well as the fashion style are all enjoyed by people on the radical left

03:45.840 --> 03:51.600
right now. But this also describes the right. The anti-authoritarianism and the do-it-yourself ethic,

03:51.600 --> 03:56.640
both things that are championed right now by the right, as I described in the video two days ago,

03:56.640 --> 04:01.360
why is preparation problematic, are actively rejected by the radical left right now.

04:01.360 --> 04:06.560
They want the centralized authority to implement socialism, and they want people dependent on that

04:06.560 --> 04:11.520
socialism, which means the do-it-yourself ethic is out. It's my layman's understanding that the

04:11.520 --> 04:17.040
actual core of what punk is, is the anti-authoritarianism. It's being a part of the

04:17.040 --> 04:22.080
counterculture. In fact, it's being explicitly offensive towards the mainstream. They're

04:22.080 --> 04:27.680
satirists, they're iconoclasts. They say and do things that the Karens of the world clutch their

04:27.680 --> 04:34.720
pearls at, and they say and do them specifically to cause that reaction. But, as expected, there are

04:34.720 --> 04:40.640
a lot of social justice punks, basically just feminist women who like the fashion, who are,

04:40.640 --> 04:44.080
unsurprisingly, shitting all over negative XP for his song.

04:57.680 --> 05:01.920
that frankly had no chance to be saved to begin with. Here we go!

05:27.680 --> 05:48.400
I guess punk is about embracing the establishment politics and sanitizing language now, guys.

05:48.400 --> 05:52.400
I guess it's all about falling in line with the corporate-sponsored climate protests,

05:52.400 --> 05:56.240
or ratting out rule-breakers who are going outside for non-essentials right now,

05:56.240 --> 05:59.840
or demanding government handouts. What happened to the do-it-yourself ethic?

05:59.840 --> 06:04.240
They're no longer the counterculture, they're part of the establishment now. They still desperately

06:04.240 --> 06:08.320
want to cling to that rebellious feel, that they're somehow the freedom fighters going up

06:08.320 --> 06:12.960
against the entire world. But who actually believes it? All of their musical stars are past

06:12.960 --> 06:18.640
middle age taking corporate sponsorships. Their fashion is mainstream. Their subculture is now

06:18.640 --> 06:24.000
popular and profitable, like Scott Pilgrim has shown us. I saw a fascist who is still thinking

06:24.000 --> 06:29.280
about this, and how punk is anti-establishment, so we can continue to be Trumpian and listen to

06:29.280 --> 06:34.880
punk. Oh really? And how anti-establishment are you? Considering that virtue signaling

06:34.880 --> 06:38.800
is the establishment now, and you've got that rainbow flag emoji in your name,

06:39.360 --> 06:44.480
you've got those pronouns in your bio. And yes, virtue signaling is the mainstream culture right

06:44.480 --> 06:48.640
now. I don't give a fuck if you're cisgender, put your damn pronouns in your bio. Hey,

06:48.640 --> 06:54.160
just want to urge cis oomps to put your pronouns in your bio, let's help create a safe space for

06:54.160 --> 06:58.080
the transgender community. A good way to subtly signal to trans people that you're with them is

06:58.080 --> 07:01.680
to put your pronouns in your bio. We would like this to become standard practice because it makes

07:01.680 --> 07:06.640
more sense. Putting pronouns in your bio for cis people helps normalize and protect trans individuals.

07:06.640 --> 07:11.360
If this is the mainstream right now, then the offensive counterculture would be to parody this.

07:11.360 --> 07:17.120
But sarcastically using zee and zur, or mentioning identifying as an attack helicopter or something,

07:17.120 --> 07:20.640
that's not considered punk, even though it actually fits with the original spirit of punk.

07:20.640 --> 07:25.200
That's considered fascist or whatever. Alright, forget the stupid twitter junk for a minute.

07:25.200 --> 07:31.600
The punk subculture is still about being shocking. It's still about being provocative. It's still

07:31.600 --> 07:37.040
about causing moral panics. The only difference is, it's now the punks themselves that are the

07:37.040 --> 07:42.880
targets of it. Again, at the risk of sounding like an old man, the left of today has failed

07:42.880 --> 07:46.720
to realize that we've advanced into a new political era. The republicans were once the

07:46.720 --> 07:51.440
party of George Bush and the neo-cons. They were all about globalist corporatism, eternal war in

07:51.440 --> 07:56.640
the middle east generally over oil, and codifying christian fundamentalism into american law.

07:56.640 --> 08:01.600
During that era, the 90s and the 2000s, it was very easy for the left to hold the moral high

08:01.600 --> 08:06.720
ground against that kind of an opponent. And most people who are relatively apolitical, but lazily

08:06.720 --> 08:12.800
identify as center left, do so because of that era. Left became the dominant political affiliation

08:12.800 --> 08:17.600
for your average joe, because the right was just constantly dropping the ball. But there was a

08:17.600 --> 08:22.720
paradigm shift in 2012. Again, go back to that Rachel Maddow clip that I posted like a week or

08:22.720 --> 08:29.040
so ago. The republicans got destroyed in those elections. And when they came back, they were not

08:29.040 --> 08:34.240
George Bush's republicans. The remnants of that republican party are still embodied in like the

08:34.240 --> 08:38.400
Mitt Romney never trumpers, who are basically losers at this point. They have no political

08:38.400 --> 08:43.360
capital anymore. But the left still pretends like it has the moral high ground, like it's fighting

08:43.360 --> 08:48.960
the right wing of old, like they are somehow still the counterculture, still the subversive element

08:48.960 --> 08:54.400
taking on the evil empire. But that's just not how it is anymore. The radical left is not the

08:54.400 --> 09:00.560
rebellion. And this whole punk thing, with this frankly kind of dumb negative xp song, perfectly

09:00.560 --> 09:06.320
encapsulates this wider issue. These people have been so used to thinking that they are the

09:06.320 --> 09:11.360
counterculture, that now that they're not, now that they've actually seized cultural power,

09:11.360 --> 09:17.360
now that their ideology can be found everywhere in our society, they have no idea what to do. So

09:17.360 --> 09:22.080
they just carry on acting like they're somehow still the underdog, and as a result they keep

09:22.080 --> 09:27.360
losing to the actual underdog. I mean really, do you think people like Greta Thunberg, or even

09:27.360 --> 09:31.760
Anita Sarkeesian, to bring back an old name, do you really think they're the grassroots

09:31.760 --> 09:36.800
counterculture, speaking at the UN? Or do you think the counterculture is maybe all the YouTubers

09:36.800 --> 09:42.560
listed in the alternative action report? I mean, as flawed as that thing was, the whole point of

09:42.560 --> 09:49.600
it was to describe how these deplorables, these subversives, these people who had absolutely no

09:49.600 --> 09:55.040
mainstream support, had crafted their own community outside the walls, beyond the bounds of

09:55.040 --> 09:59.760
what the mainstream considers acceptable. Now, they labeled it as an alt-right pipeline, which

09:59.760 --> 10:04.960
is completely ludicrous, but it is a structure that isn't mainstream. It is the new counterculture.

10:04.960 --> 10:10.240
I think this is why Negative XP's song received, and continues to receive, despite being over eight

10:10.240 --> 10:16.240
months old, this ridiculous backlash. Because it's using, for the first time in probably a decade,

10:16.240 --> 10:21.600
the sound of punk to do what punk was originally meant to do, offend the sensibilities of the

10:21.600 --> 10:26.720
mainstream. And because things have swung so far to the left that the counterculture now is,

10:26.720 --> 10:31.840
paradoxically, the adoption of traditional values, at least in some areas, then it makes

10:31.840 --> 10:37.920
complete sense that Negative XP's song would be a critique of current sexual morality. The people

10:37.920 --> 10:43.600
getting triggered might have adopted the punk fashion sense, but they truly do not understand

10:43.600 --> 10:45.760
the punk spirit at all.
