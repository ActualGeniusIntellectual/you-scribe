0	5840	I'm feeling like a broken record at this point. The last like five videos of mine I've had to do
5840	12800	some kind of old man impression. Back in my day politics was like this. But I really do feel the
12800	16800	need to bring up some stuff that's happened before because it's almost like people have just forgotten
16800	22800	about it. Okay so at this point you must have heard the song Scott Pilgrim vs The World Ruined
22800	49920	a Whole Generation of Women, right? By negative XP. He really managed to nail down that generic
49920	54560	90s punk sound. A genre of music I'm really not that interested in. But nonetheless he's got
54560	58720	enough talent to pull it off. The quality of the music isn't what everyone's talking about though,
58720	61040	it's the lyrics.
79920	87040	Haha, don't go throwing stones about the shitty music dude. But this song's wildly popular,
87040	92560	way more popular than anything else negative XP has done. And it is because the lyrics are
92560	98640	describing a certain type of person that would normally be very interested in this sound. Either
98640	103120	the type of woman who would listen to this and really enjoy it, if the lyrics were different
103120	107280	of course, or alternatively the type of man who listened to this kind of stuff in high school
107280	111360	grew out of it and is now having a problem finding an actual girlfriend to settle down with,
111360	117280	because at least some of the girls his age are accurately described by this song. The actual guy
117280	122720	himself, I'm not sure if he's just a memester or if he actually is an MRA, but to be honest it
122720	127680	doesn't really matter. Either way the establishment right now is kind of angry at him for this song.
127680	133280	But wait, what is the establishment anyway? So we're just defending an incel and a sexist
133280	136800	because of my punk culture. You do realize this guy's a serious incel.
136800	140720	You cannot claim to be a part of a culture or subculture if you have no idea what its
140720	145680	roots and values are. Wearing all black does not make you goth. Liking the 70s in drugs
145680	150000	does not make you a hippie. You cannot be a conservative punk. Culture is more than
150000	154880	appearance and interests. Punk cannot literally be right wing shut the fuck up lmao. The whole
154880	160400	point is that it's not. Really? Is that the point? I didn't know that the punk subculture had a
160400	165920	particular political slant. The punk subculture includes a diverse array of ideologies, fashion,
165920	171680	and other forms of expression, visual art, dance, literature, and film. It is largely characterized
171680	176800	by anti-establishment views, the promotion of individual freedom, do-it-yourself ethics,
176800	180800	and is centered on a loud aggressive genre of rock music called punk rock.
181600	186960	Punk politics cover the entire political spectrum. The punk ethos is primarily made up of beliefs
187040	193200	such as nonconformity, anti-authoritarianism, anti-corporatism, a do-it-yourself ethic,
193200	199840	anti-consumerism, anti-corporate greed, direct action, and not selling out. There is a wide array
199840	204640	of punk fashion including deliberately offensive t-shirts, leather jackets, Dr. Martin's boots,
205200	210320	hairstyles such as brightly colored hair and spiked mohawks, cosmetics, tattoos, jewelry,
210320	215760	and body modification. Women in the hardcore scene typically wear masculine clothing.
215760	220560	This definitely sounds like it can describe the left. The anti-corporatism, the direct action,
220560	225840	the not selling out, as well as the fashion style are all enjoyed by people on the radical left
225840	231600	right now. But this also describes the right. The anti-authoritarianism and the do-it-yourself ethic,
231600	236640	both things that are championed right now by the right, as I described in the video two days ago,
236640	241360	why is preparation problematic, are actively rejected by the radical left right now.
241360	246560	They want the centralized authority to implement socialism, and they want people dependent on that
246560	251520	socialism, which means the do-it-yourself ethic is out. It's my layman's understanding that the
251520	257040	actual core of what punk is, is the anti-authoritarianism. It's being a part of the
257040	262080	counterculture. In fact, it's being explicitly offensive towards the mainstream. They're
262080	267680	satirists, they're iconoclasts. They say and do things that the Karens of the world clutch their
267680	274720	pearls at, and they say and do them specifically to cause that reaction. But, as expected, there are
274720	280640	a lot of social justice punks, basically just feminist women who like the fashion, who are,
280640	284080	unsurprisingly, shitting all over negative XP for his song.
297680	301920	that frankly had no chance to be saved to begin with. Here we go!
327680	348400	I guess punk is about embracing the establishment politics and sanitizing language now, guys.
348400	352400	I guess it's all about falling in line with the corporate-sponsored climate protests,
352400	356240	or ratting out rule-breakers who are going outside for non-essentials right now,
356240	359840	or demanding government handouts. What happened to the do-it-yourself ethic?
359840	364240	They're no longer the counterculture, they're part of the establishment now. They still desperately
364240	368320	want to cling to that rebellious feel, that they're somehow the freedom fighters going up
368320	372960	against the entire world. But who actually believes it? All of their musical stars are past
372960	378640	middle age taking corporate sponsorships. Their fashion is mainstream. Their subculture is now
378640	384000	popular and profitable, like Scott Pilgrim has shown us. I saw a fascist who is still thinking
384000	389280	about this, and how punk is anti-establishment, so we can continue to be Trumpian and listen to
389280	394880	punk. Oh really? And how anti-establishment are you? Considering that virtue signaling
394880	398800	is the establishment now, and you've got that rainbow flag emoji in your name,
399360	404480	you've got those pronouns in your bio. And yes, virtue signaling is the mainstream culture right
404480	408640	now. I don't give a fuck if you're cisgender, put your damn pronouns in your bio. Hey,
408640	414160	just want to urge cis oomps to put your pronouns in your bio, let's help create a safe space for
414160	418080	the transgender community. A good way to subtly signal to trans people that you're with them is
418080	421680	to put your pronouns in your bio. We would like this to become standard practice because it makes
421680	426640	more sense. Putting pronouns in your bio for cis people helps normalize and protect trans individuals.
426640	431360	If this is the mainstream right now, then the offensive counterculture would be to parody this.
431360	437120	But sarcastically using zee and zur, or mentioning identifying as an attack helicopter or something,
437120	440640	that's not considered punk, even though it actually fits with the original spirit of punk.
440640	445200	That's considered fascist or whatever. Alright, forget the stupid twitter junk for a minute.
445200	451600	The punk subculture is still about being shocking. It's still about being provocative. It's still
451600	457040	about causing moral panics. The only difference is, it's now the punks themselves that are the
457040	462880	targets of it. Again, at the risk of sounding like an old man, the left of today has failed
462880	466720	to realize that we've advanced into a new political era. The republicans were once the
466720	471440	party of George Bush and the neo-cons. They were all about globalist corporatism, eternal war in
471440	476640	the middle east generally over oil, and codifying christian fundamentalism into american law.
476640	481600	During that era, the 90s and the 2000s, it was very easy for the left to hold the moral high
481600	486720	ground against that kind of an opponent. And most people who are relatively apolitical, but lazily
486720	492800	identify as center left, do so because of that era. Left became the dominant political affiliation
492800	497600	for your average joe, because the right was just constantly dropping the ball. But there was a
497600	502720	paradigm shift in 2012. Again, go back to that Rachel Maddow clip that I posted like a week or
502720	509040	so ago. The republicans got destroyed in those elections. And when they came back, they were not
509040	514240	George Bush's republicans. The remnants of that republican party are still embodied in like the
514240	518400	Mitt Romney never trumpers, who are basically losers at this point. They have no political
518400	523360	capital anymore. But the left still pretends like it has the moral high ground, like it's fighting
523360	528960	the right wing of old, like they are somehow still the counterculture, still the subversive element
528960	534400	taking on the evil empire. But that's just not how it is anymore. The radical left is not the
534400	540560	rebellion. And this whole punk thing, with this frankly kind of dumb negative xp song, perfectly
540560	546320	encapsulates this wider issue. These people have been so used to thinking that they are the
546320	551360	counterculture, that now that they're not, now that they've actually seized cultural power,
551360	557360	now that their ideology can be found everywhere in our society, they have no idea what to do. So
557360	562080	they just carry on acting like they're somehow still the underdog, and as a result they keep
562080	567360	losing to the actual underdog. I mean really, do you think people like Greta Thunberg, or even
567360	571760	Anita Sarkeesian, to bring back an old name, do you really think they're the grassroots
571760	576800	counterculture, speaking at the UN? Or do you think the counterculture is maybe all the YouTubers
576800	582560	listed in the alternative action report? I mean, as flawed as that thing was, the whole point of
582560	589600	it was to describe how these deplorables, these subversives, these people who had absolutely no
589600	595040	mainstream support, had crafted their own community outside the walls, beyond the bounds of
595040	599760	what the mainstream considers acceptable. Now, they labeled it as an alt-right pipeline, which
599760	604960	is completely ludicrous, but it is a structure that isn't mainstream. It is the new counterculture.
604960	610240	I think this is why Negative XP's song received, and continues to receive, despite being over eight
610240	616240	months old, this ridiculous backlash. Because it's using, for the first time in probably a decade,
616240	621600	the sound of punk to do what punk was originally meant to do, offend the sensibilities of the
621600	626720	mainstream. And because things have swung so far to the left that the counterculture now is,
626720	631840	paradoxically, the adoption of traditional values, at least in some areas, then it makes
631840	637920	complete sense that Negative XP's song would be a critique of current sexual morality. The people
637920	643600	getting triggered might have adopted the punk fashion sense, but they truly do not understand
643600	645760	the punk spirit at all.
