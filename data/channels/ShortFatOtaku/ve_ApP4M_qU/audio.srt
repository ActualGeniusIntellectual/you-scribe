1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
I'm feeling like a broken record at this point. The last like five videos of mine I've had to do

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:12,800
some kind of old man impression. Back in my day politics was like this. But I really do feel the

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,800
need to bring up some stuff that's happened before because it's almost like people have just forgotten

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,800
about it. Okay so at this point you must have heard the song Scott Pilgrim vs The World Ruined

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:49,920
a Whole Generation of Women, right? By negative XP. He really managed to nail down that generic

6
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,560
90s punk sound. A genre of music I'm really not that interested in. But nonetheless he's got

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,720
enough talent to pull it off. The quality of the music isn't what everyone's talking about though,

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,040
it's the lyrics.

9
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,040
Haha, don't go throwing stones about the shitty music dude. But this song's wildly popular,

10
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,560
way more popular than anything else negative XP has done. And it is because the lyrics are

11
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,640
describing a certain type of person that would normally be very interested in this sound. Either

12
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,120
the type of woman who would listen to this and really enjoy it, if the lyrics were different

13
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,280
of course, or alternatively the type of man who listened to this kind of stuff in high school

14
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,360
grew out of it and is now having a problem finding an actual girlfriend to settle down with,

15
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,280
because at least some of the girls his age are accurately described by this song. The actual guy

16
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,720
himself, I'm not sure if he's just a memester or if he actually is an MRA, but to be honest it

17
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,680
doesn't really matter. Either way the establishment right now is kind of angry at him for this song.

18
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,280
But wait, what is the establishment anyway? So we're just defending an incel and a sexist

19
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,800
because of my punk culture. You do realize this guy's a serious incel.

20
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,720
You cannot claim to be a part of a culture or subculture if you have no idea what its

21
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,680
roots and values are. Wearing all black does not make you goth. Liking the 70s in drugs

22
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,000
does not make you a hippie. You cannot be a conservative punk. Culture is more than

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,880
appearance and interests. Punk cannot literally be right wing shut the fuck up lmao. The whole

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,400
point is that it's not. Really? Is that the point? I didn't know that the punk subculture had a

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,920
particular political slant. The punk subculture includes a diverse array of ideologies, fashion,

26
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,680
and other forms of expression, visual art, dance, literature, and film. It is largely characterized

27
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,800
by anti-establishment views, the promotion of individual freedom, do-it-yourself ethics,

28
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,800
and is centered on a loud aggressive genre of rock music called punk rock.

29
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,960
Punk politics cover the entire political spectrum. The punk ethos is primarily made up of beliefs

30
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,200
such as nonconformity, anti-authoritarianism, anti-corporatism, a do-it-yourself ethic,

31
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,840
anti-consumerism, anti-corporate greed, direct action, and not selling out. There is a wide array

32
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,640
of punk fashion including deliberately offensive t-shirts, leather jackets, Dr. Martin's boots,

33
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,320
hairstyles such as brightly colored hair and spiked mohawks, cosmetics, tattoos, jewelry,

34
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,760
and body modification. Women in the hardcore scene typically wear masculine clothing.

35
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,560
This definitely sounds like it can describe the left. The anti-corporatism, the direct action,

36
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,840
the not selling out, as well as the fashion style are all enjoyed by people on the radical left

37
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,600
right now. But this also describes the right. The anti-authoritarianism and the do-it-yourself ethic,

38
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,640
both things that are championed right now by the right, as I described in the video two days ago,

39
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,360
why is preparation problematic, are actively rejected by the radical left right now.

40
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,560
They want the centralized authority to implement socialism, and they want people dependent on that

41
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,520
socialism, which means the do-it-yourself ethic is out. It's my layman's understanding that the

42
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,040
actual core of what punk is, is the anti-authoritarianism. It's being a part of the

43
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,080
counterculture. In fact, it's being explicitly offensive towards the mainstream. They're

44
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,680
satirists, they're iconoclasts. They say and do things that the Karens of the world clutch their

45
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,720
pearls at, and they say and do them specifically to cause that reaction. But, as expected, there are

46
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,640
a lot of social justice punks, basically just feminist women who like the fashion, who are,

47
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,080
unsurprisingly, shitting all over negative XP for his song.

48
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,920
that frankly had no chance to be saved to begin with. Here we go!

49
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:48,400
I guess punk is about embracing the establishment politics and sanitizing language now, guys.

50
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,400
I guess it's all about falling in line with the corporate-sponsored climate protests,

51
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,240
or ratting out rule-breakers who are going outside for non-essentials right now,

52
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,840
or demanding government handouts. What happened to the do-it-yourself ethic?

53
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,240
They're no longer the counterculture, they're part of the establishment now. They still desperately

54
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,320
want to cling to that rebellious feel, that they're somehow the freedom fighters going up

55
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,960
against the entire world. But who actually believes it? All of their musical stars are past

56
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,640
middle age taking corporate sponsorships. Their fashion is mainstream. Their subculture is now

57
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,000
popular and profitable, like Scott Pilgrim has shown us. I saw a fascist who is still thinking

58
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,280
about this, and how punk is anti-establishment, so we can continue to be Trumpian and listen to

59
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,880
punk. Oh really? And how anti-establishment are you? Considering that virtue signaling

60
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,800
is the establishment now, and you've got that rainbow flag emoji in your name,

61
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,480
you've got those pronouns in your bio. And yes, virtue signaling is the mainstream culture right

62
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,640
now. I don't give a fuck if you're cisgender, put your damn pronouns in your bio. Hey,

63
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:54,160
just want to urge cis oomps to put your pronouns in your bio, let's help create a safe space for

64
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,080
the transgender community. A good way to subtly signal to trans people that you're with them is

65
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,680
to put your pronouns in your bio. We would like this to become standard practice because it makes

66
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,640
more sense. Putting pronouns in your bio for cis people helps normalize and protect trans individuals.

67
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,360
If this is the mainstream right now, then the offensive counterculture would be to parody this.

68
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,120
But sarcastically using zee and zur, or mentioning identifying as an attack helicopter or something,

69
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,640
that's not considered punk, even though it actually fits with the original spirit of punk.

70
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,200
That's considered fascist or whatever. Alright, forget the stupid twitter junk for a minute.

71
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:31,600
The punk subculture is still about being shocking. It's still about being provocative. It's still

72
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,040
about causing moral panics. The only difference is, it's now the punks themselves that are the

73
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,880
targets of it. Again, at the risk of sounding like an old man, the left of today has failed

74
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,720
to realize that we've advanced into a new political era. The republicans were once the

75
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,440
party of George Bush and the neo-cons. They were all about globalist corporatism, eternal war in

76
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,640
the middle east generally over oil, and codifying christian fundamentalism into american law.

77
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,600
During that era, the 90s and the 2000s, it was very easy for the left to hold the moral high

78
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,720
ground against that kind of an opponent. And most people who are relatively apolitical, but lazily

79
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,800
identify as center left, do so because of that era. Left became the dominant political affiliation

80
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,600
for your average joe, because the right was just constantly dropping the ball. But there was a

81
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,720
paradigm shift in 2012. Again, go back to that Rachel Maddow clip that I posted like a week or

82
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,040
so ago. The republicans got destroyed in those elections. And when they came back, they were not

83
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,240
George Bush's republicans. The remnants of that republican party are still embodied in like the

84
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,400
Mitt Romney never trumpers, who are basically losers at this point. They have no political

85
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,360
capital anymore. But the left still pretends like it has the moral high ground, like it's fighting

86
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,960
the right wing of old, like they are somehow still the counterculture, still the subversive element

87
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,400
taking on the evil empire. But that's just not how it is anymore. The radical left is not the

88
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,560
rebellion. And this whole punk thing, with this frankly kind of dumb negative xp song, perfectly

89
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,320
encapsulates this wider issue. These people have been so used to thinking that they are the

90
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,360
counterculture, that now that they're not, now that they've actually seized cultural power,

91
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,360
now that their ideology can be found everywhere in our society, they have no idea what to do. So

92
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,080
they just carry on acting like they're somehow still the underdog, and as a result they keep

93
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,360
losing to the actual underdog. I mean really, do you think people like Greta Thunberg, or even

94
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,760
Anita Sarkeesian, to bring back an old name, do you really think they're the grassroots

95
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,800
counterculture, speaking at the UN? Or do you think the counterculture is maybe all the YouTubers

96
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,560
listed in the alternative action report? I mean, as flawed as that thing was, the whole point of

97
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,600
it was to describe how these deplorables, these subversives, these people who had absolutely no

98
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,040
mainstream support, had crafted their own community outside the walls, beyond the bounds of

99
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,760
what the mainstream considers acceptable. Now, they labeled it as an alt-right pipeline, which

100
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,960
is completely ludicrous, but it is a structure that isn't mainstream. It is the new counterculture.

101
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,240
I think this is why Negative XP's song received, and continues to receive, despite being over eight

102
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,240
months old, this ridiculous backlash. Because it's using, for the first time in probably a decade,

103
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,600
the sound of punk to do what punk was originally meant to do, offend the sensibilities of the

104
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,720
mainstream. And because things have swung so far to the left that the counterculture now is,

105
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,840
paradoxically, the adoption of traditional values, at least in some areas, then it makes

106
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,920
complete sense that Negative XP's song would be a critique of current sexual morality. The people

107
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,600
getting triggered might have adopted the punk fashion sense, but they truly do not understand

108
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,760
the punk spirit at all.
