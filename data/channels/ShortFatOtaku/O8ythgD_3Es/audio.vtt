00:00.000 --> 00:15.200
Around this time last year, there was a flash-in-the-pan controversy surrounding then-senior counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway, and her 15-year-old daughter, Claudia.

00:15.200 --> 00:22.200
Kellyanne is a lifelong conservative, was previously Trump's campaign manager, and has spent her career as a general Republican party strategist.

00:22.200 --> 00:36.200
Her time in the White House was marred with controversy, ranging from relatively benign mis-speech, like the fictitious Bowling Green Massacre, and stuff like alternative facts, to actually unethical violations of the 1939 Hatch Act,

00:36.200 --> 00:45.200
preventing members of the federal government from using the powers of their offices to influence elections or promote the businesses of family members of the president, both things that Kellyanne did repeatedly.

00:45.200 --> 00:51.700
During this 2020 Conway controversy, Kellyanne and her husband George requested that the media keep their children out of the limelight.

00:51.700 --> 00:56.700
After all, no matter what Kellyanne herself did, the kids aren't to blame, and it's kind of tacky to bring them into it.

00:56.700 --> 01:03.200
But Claudia Conway, having her own platform as a TikTok influencer, decided to speak up anyway, saying of her father,

01:03.200 --> 01:07.700
You're just mad that I'm finally getting my voice heard, and sorry your marriage failed.

01:07.700 --> 01:13.700
Claudia's channel at the time was full of Black Lives Matter, socialist, ACAB, and anti-Trump content.

01:13.700 --> 01:15.200
At one point she said,

01:15.200 --> 01:22.200
If you're a woman supporting Trump, I feel bad for you. You must really hate yourself. Lots of internalized misogyny. Yikes.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.700
Apparently meaning the message to be a jab at her mother.

01:24.700 --> 01:29.200
Afterward, Claudia announced that she was seeking legal emancipation from her parents.

01:29.200 --> 01:36.200
Six months later, Claudia posted a series of secretly recorded videos where Kellyanne was insulting her, berating her, and hitting her.

01:36.200 --> 01:39.200
One fucking bit for you to tell people I'm a bitch.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.200
What?

01:40.200 --> 01:41.200
What?

01:41.200 --> 01:42.200
What?

01:42.200 --> 01:44.200
What?

01:44.200 --> 01:45.200
There's something wrong with you.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.200
Yeah, there is.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.200
I'm mocking me.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.200
You think I'm mocking you?

01:48.200 --> 01:50.200
I'm trying to have a conversation with you.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.200
Do you know what you've done to yourself?

01:51.200 --> 01:53.200
Do you know what you've done to yourself?

01:53.200 --> 01:54.200
50.

01:54.200 --> 01:55.200
Yeah.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.200
Fucking immature.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.200
Before you get it all over the sheets that I clean.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.200
Can you stop?

02:00.200 --> 02:01.200
No, you don't ignore me.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.200
Bitch.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.200
Bitch.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.200
Asshole.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.200
Can my mom clean?

02:05.200 --> 02:06.200
Can you please, mom?

02:06.200 --> 02:07.200
No, you please.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.200
I want you out of here.

02:08.200 --> 02:10.200
You were making you mad.

02:10.200 --> 02:12.200
Some 15-fucking-year-old made you mad.

02:12.200 --> 02:18.200
These videos went viral, and shortly afterward, a topless picture of Claudia was posted to Kellyanne's official Twitter account.

02:18.200 --> 02:22.200
Keep in mind that she's still 16 at this point, and the picture is quickly deleted.

02:22.200 --> 02:29.200
We don't know who posted that pic, whether it was Kellyanne going even more off the rails, or Claudia framing her mom, or some hacker fucking around, or what.

02:29.200 --> 02:36.200
The only thing we do know is that Claudia had taken a topless pic of herself, and for some reason that picture made its way to Kellyanne's account.

02:36.200 --> 02:40.200
Of course, the police got involved, and since then the drama has seemed to calm down.

02:40.200 --> 02:48.200
Kellyanne is still posting about her politics, Claudia is still on TikTok but only posting vapid teenager shit, but the political drama has basically disappeared.

02:48.200 --> 02:51.200
If I had to guess, Claudia is just biding her time until she can move out.

02:51.200 --> 02:57.200
It's a strange story because any sane person who watches these TikToks sees that Kellyanne is treating her daughter like shit.

02:57.200 --> 03:00.200
At the same time, Claudia is living up that party lifestyle.

03:00.200 --> 03:04.200
Drinking on the beach, driving around with her boyfriend in nice cars, appearing on TV.

03:16.200 --> 03:20.200
She's a stereotypical Stacy with a Chad BF, and somebody's got to be paying for all this shit.

03:20.200 --> 03:28.200
Also, even though she makes fun of OnlyFans for trying to recruit her on Twitter, she really seems to be easing into an OnlyFans Lite position on her account.

03:28.200 --> 03:33.200
It almost seems like kids are grooming themselves for porn nowadays. Fucking hell.

03:33.200 --> 03:42.200
The point is, this may be an extremely public high profile case, but it's something that a lot of progressive kids with conservative parents seem to be relating to right now.

03:42.200 --> 03:51.200
Remember this story? Teresa Duke got slugged in the face during the January 6th Capitol riots, and her lesbian disowned daughter, Helena Duke, retweeted the video saying,

03:51.200 --> 03:57.200
Hi mom, remember when you told me I shouldn't go to BLM protests because they could get violent? Is this you?

03:57.200 --> 04:00.200
And it's like, fair enough. She's got you there, mom.

04:00.200 --> 04:10.200
Teresa ended up losing her job over this, and Helena has since moved away to the big city, where she now lives with her girlfriend, talking about going to the hospital because she cut herself while trying to slice an avocado,

04:10.200 --> 04:14.200
and how she wants to live in a commune because fuck capitalism, amirite?

04:14.200 --> 04:29.200
This is a common enough thing. Conservative parents that are legitimately shitty to their kids, and radicalized, young leftist activists who view their parents as literally Hitler cutting them off, moving out of their small town, and then end up becoming extremists in their own right, only for the other team.

04:29.200 --> 04:33.200
It seems to be crazier now more than it's ever been, but this effect has been seen for a while.

04:34.200 --> 04:44.200
Old people look down on young people as lacking experience, or knowledge, or wisdom. Young people look down on old people for being too ancient in their thinking, and not updating their mental models to fit the current paradigm.

04:44.200 --> 04:52.200
On some level, they're both correct. Young people think they're the vanguard of a new society, and as soon as the last old people are finally gone, they can remake things in their image.

04:52.200 --> 04:59.200
Old people think that the kids are just being rowdy, and they'll settle down and become more conservative as they age, as that age makes them tougher and more competent.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.200
And again, on some level, they're both correct.

05:02.200 --> 05:07.200
That is some commonly repeated folk wisdom, by the way, that people get more conservative as they age.

05:07.200 --> 05:15.200
Well, how true is it, actually? Conservatives love to lean on common sense in their online discussions, while progressives will often pull out this study.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.200
Do people really become more conservative as they age?

05:18.200 --> 05:22.200
Yeah, I had a double take on it, too. It's Jonathan Peterson, not Jordan Peterson.

05:22.200 --> 05:28.200
But because it's online discussions, progressives rarely read past this sentence in the abstract.

05:28.200 --> 05:35.200
Consistent with previous research, but contrary to folk wisdom, our results indicate that political attitudes are remarkably stable over the long term.

05:35.200 --> 05:38.200
Of course, the very next sentence reads,

05:38.200 --> 05:42.200
In contrast to previous research, however, we also find support for the folk wisdom.

05:43.200 --> 05:51.200
On those occasions where political attitudes do shift across the lifespan, liberals are more likely to become conservatives than conservatives are to become liberals,

05:51.200 --> 05:56.200
suggesting that folk wisdom has some empirical basis even as it overstates the degree of change.

05:56.200 --> 06:01.200
In other words, people aren't likely to change over time, but if they do change, there's a higher chance they become more conservative.

06:01.200 --> 06:04.200
The study itself describes the various reasons as to why this might be the case.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.200
Firstly, there's psychological factors.

06:06.200 --> 06:10.200
The tendency for age to bring with it increasing self-discipline and self-sufficiency.

06:10.200 --> 06:17.200
Preference for order, avoidance of uncertainty, capacity to remember emotionally-laden stimuli, and alterations in neural structures that come with aging.

06:17.200 --> 06:21.200
This also correlates with our understanding of fluid and crystallized intelligence.

06:21.200 --> 06:27.200
Fluid intelligence slowly declines as we age, and we can observe this in a gradual drop-off of IQ across a person's life.

06:27.200 --> 06:32.200
While crystallized intelligence remains constant, our ability to learn new things slowly disappears.

06:32.200 --> 06:39.200
The things that we've already learned stick with us right up to the end, seemingly providing evidence for the idea that old people appear to be stuck in their ways.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.200
The aging study also mentions that social aging plays a role.

06:42.200 --> 06:48.200
Your social circle is primarily friends and peers and romantic partners sometimes up until you start a family,

06:48.200 --> 06:52.200
and then it shifts to a more localized circle of family members and work acquaintances,

06:52.200 --> 06:57.200
and then all social interaction drops off rapidly after retirement and the kids have left the nest.

06:57.200 --> 07:04.200
There seems to be a correlation between the loss of naivete and idealism with the adoption of more and more responsibility as we grow older.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.200
This view seems to be congruent with another paper.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.200
Ideological differences in the expanse of the moral circle.

07:09.200 --> 07:12.200
And yes, that's the actual Jonathan Haidt involved this time.

07:12.200 --> 07:18.200
By the way, because these are all American studies, they use liberal to refer to left and conservative to refer to right.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.200
I hate how Americans have ruined language.

07:20.200 --> 07:23.200
Liberals, progressives, and socialists are not the same thing.

07:23.200 --> 07:29.200
But the point is, the more leftward people go, the more likely it is that they prioritize friends over family and the planet over the nation.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.200
And the more rightward people go, the opposite effect happens.

07:32.200 --> 07:36.200
For example, the love of friends remains constant across the political spectrum,

07:36.200 --> 07:40.200
but love of family goes up on the right and love of world goes up on the left,

07:40.200 --> 07:46.200
such that on the extreme left, people slightly prefer the planet over their friends and both significantly more than their family.

07:46.200 --> 07:49.200
You can chart a similar trend between nationalist and globalist values.

07:49.200 --> 07:55.200
You can even show that the extreme left slightly prefers non-human life over human life,

07:55.200 --> 07:58.200
while the rest of the spectrum, even the center left, prefers humanity.

07:58.200 --> 08:01.200
The most telling part of the study, in my opinion, is this heat map.

08:01.200 --> 08:08.200
Each person was given 100 moral units to assign to 16 areas of concern, represented by these 16 concentric circles,

08:08.200 --> 08:13.200
with each circle being a slightly more universalized area of concern than the previous.

08:13.200 --> 08:16.200
Circle 1, right in the center, is all of your immediate family.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.200
Circle 2 is your extended family.

08:18.200 --> 08:23.200
Circle 3 is your close friends, then your distant friends, your acquaintances, all the people you've ever met,

08:23.200 --> 08:29.200
all citizens of your country, all people on your continent, all humans, all mammals, all animals,

08:29.200 --> 08:35.200
all living things on Earth, including amoeba, all animals in the universe, including undiscovered alien life,

08:35.200 --> 08:39.200
all living things in the universe, including alien amoeba, plants, and trees,

08:39.200 --> 08:45.200
all things in the universe, including non-living things like space rocks, and finally, the universe itself.

08:45.200 --> 08:50.200
Each participant had to divide up their 100 moral units to each of these 16 areas of concern.

08:50.200 --> 08:58.200
The heat map shows that the conservatives, on average, placed the majority of their moral units on circles 3 and 4, their close and distant friends,

08:58.200 --> 09:06.200
while liberals placed the majority of theirs on circle 14, all living things in the universe, including alien amoeba, plants, and trees.

09:06.200 --> 09:11.200
Moreover, conservatives were more likely to spread their moral units out a little bit more than the liberals,

09:11.200 --> 09:18.200
with the highest value on the liberal heat map being 20 units in one location, while the highest value on the conservative heat map was 12.

09:18.200 --> 09:25.200
The liberals were more likely to crowd their moral units on the more universalist domains, while the conservatives crowded them on localist ones.

09:25.200 --> 09:32.200
Comparing the extremes, your average conservative cares more about his immediate family and his close friends than the universe or any random amoeba in it,

09:32.200 --> 09:38.200
and your average liberal cares about the inverse, more about the universe and its random amoeba than his immediate family or close friends.

09:38.200 --> 09:43.200
And even though humans do actually only have so much moral consideration to pass around,

09:43.200 --> 09:49.200
just to ensure that their results weren't the product of artificially limiting the amount of concern they have at 100 units,

09:49.200 --> 09:56.200
they replicated the test with an infinite amount of moral units, and despite it being infinite, the distribution ended up the same.

09:56.200 --> 10:00.200
Putting aside the, um, more obvious implications of this study for now,

10:00.200 --> 10:05.200
this lines up with the aging studies assertion that your moral concerns change as your social circles do.

10:05.200 --> 10:11.200
When you're young and moving around for work or school and traveling a lot and living this cosmopolitan lifestyle,

10:11.200 --> 10:18.200
where you form no real lasting social bonds, your moral attention will be allocated more towards universalist concerns.

10:18.200 --> 10:24.200
When you're a bit older and you have a family and a house and a job, your moral attention will be allocated towards more localist concerns.

10:24.200 --> 10:31.200
And since moral attention correlates with political leanings, it's no surprise that living a more normal life would make people more conservative.

10:31.200 --> 10:34.200
The aging study also brings up some more obvious points.

10:34.200 --> 10:38.200
An older person who has had a successful career has seen his wealth grow over time due to that hard work,

10:38.200 --> 10:42.200
and one, doesn't want his wealth to be stolen by redistributive efforts,

10:42.200 --> 10:47.200
and two, doesn't understand the complaints of the poor young person, because he was also once a poor young person and he worked and made money.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.200
So they too will work and make money.

10:49.200 --> 10:54.200
Being poor and young and then older with money is exactly how you want a functioning society to work.

10:54.200 --> 10:59.200
It means that you're able to produce the necessary excess resources for your future self to live on when you can't work anymore.

10:59.200 --> 11:04.200
However, the aging study does bring up one good point against the trending conservative hypothesis,

11:04.200 --> 11:09.200
that older people have more health problems and therefore that need might drive people towards more left-leaning,

11:09.200 --> 11:14.200
redistributive policies concerning universal healthcare or social security as they get older.

11:14.200 --> 11:20.200
At this point, the aging study spends an entire page getting into the nitty-gritty of citing and explaining many other studies,

11:20.200 --> 11:24.200
most of which conclude that political views remain generally stable over time.

11:24.200 --> 11:29.200
This view lines up with the conclusion of a completely different paper, genetic influences on political ideologies.

11:29.200 --> 11:38.200
Here, an aggregation of twin studies was used to determine that between 30-60% of the variants in social and political attitudes can be explained by genetic influences,

11:38.200 --> 11:41.200
but also that the search for a politics gene was fruitless,

11:41.200 --> 11:45.200
because thousands of genes influence the biological component of a person's natural political leaning.

11:45.200 --> 11:50.200
It seems that, speaking very generally, a significant portion of our politics comes from our biology,

11:50.200 --> 11:53.200
and also that our politics are not likely to change across our lifespan.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.200
Let's look at the aging study's data.

11:55.200 --> 12:02.200
When people's political attitudes did change, they were more likely to change between the ages of 26-35 rather than 36-50.

12:02.200 --> 12:10.200
The only statistically significant political change from 36-50 was the ideological label people identified as publicly rather than any policy position.

12:10.200 --> 12:17.200
In other words, when people do become more conservative as they age, they're more likely to adopt conservative positions between 26-35,

12:17.200 --> 12:22.200
but not actually likely to identify as a conservative until between 36-50.

12:22.200 --> 12:26.200
This lines up with the adoption of responsibility and the changing of social circles that we talked about earlier,

12:26.200 --> 12:29.200
but it also lines up with Piaget's stages of cognitive development.

12:29.200 --> 12:36.200
Piaget developed this theory by noticing that children were not just tiny adults, but actually thought in fundamentally different ways than adults.

12:36.200 --> 12:41.200
He identified four stages of cognitive development, sensory motor, which ranges from birth to two years,

12:41.200 --> 12:45.200
pre-operational, which is two to seven, concrete operational, which is seven to eleven,

12:45.200 --> 12:50.200
and formal operational, which is twelve to the end of puberty and beginning of concrete adulthood,

12:50.200 --> 12:52.200
which is variable and happens all over the twenties.

12:52.200 --> 12:56.200
We're concerned with the formal operational stage, twelve to adulthood.

12:56.200 --> 13:00.200
This is where the person finally shows the beginning of fully abstract thinking,

13:00.200 --> 13:05.200
and undergoes a general awakening to the existence of morality, philosophy, ethics, and politics.

13:05.200 --> 13:08.200
Piaget referred to this stage colloquially as the Messianic stage,

13:08.200 --> 13:12.200
as what often comes with it is a desire to change the world for the better.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.200
And that makes sense to me.

13:13.200 --> 13:18.200
Of course, a thinking being's first encounter with morality, philosophy, ethics, and politics

13:18.200 --> 13:23.200
would be to use their newfound skills to notice problems and feel a desire to fix them.

13:23.200 --> 13:26.200
You'd have to be a sociopath not to feel that way, I think.

13:26.200 --> 13:32.200
Jens Roggemann from the University of Hamburg published a series of notes for a future study that is unfortunately not finished yet,

13:32.200 --> 13:34.200
talking in detail about the Messianic stage.

13:34.200 --> 13:38.200
Young people are prone to adopt idealistic and utopian ideologies,

13:38.200 --> 13:41.200
which they reassert with an almost religious fanaticism.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.200
But due to their lack of experience and their egocentric worldview,

13:44.200 --> 13:47.200
they tend to underestimate the difficulties of implementing their ideas

13:47.200 --> 13:51.200
while being blind to the backlash of their attempts in a real-world setting.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.200
Does this sound familiar to you yet?

13:53.200 --> 13:58.200
We've all had that socialist roommate who wanted to implement broad sweeping changes to reorder the world,

13:58.200 --> 14:01.200
but somehow that never actually extended to him doing his own dishes.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.200
And of course, we've all seen its inverse too.

14:03.200 --> 14:09.200
The old Fox News-watching aunt who loves her family dearly but blames all of society's problems on those damn immigrants.

14:09.200 --> 14:13.200
Everything I've talked about today seems to point at one conclusion.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.200
While leftists and rightists both have their blind spots,

14:16.200 --> 14:19.200
the problems associated with leftism are correlated with youth,

14:19.200 --> 14:22.200
simultaneously its desire for change and its lack of discipline,

14:22.200 --> 14:25.200
while the problems with rightism are correlated with age,

14:25.200 --> 14:29.200
its inability to adopt new information or understand problems larger than a local scale.

14:29.200 --> 14:32.200
Going back to the aging study, we can really hammer this point home.

14:32.200 --> 14:38.200
When movement does occur with age, the bias is towards a more conservative ideological posture.

14:38.200 --> 14:44.200
This is apparent both in moderates, where those moderates who did change were three times more likely to become conservatives than to become liberals,

14:44.200 --> 14:48.200
as well as in the imbalance of ideological movement for liberals and conservatives.

14:48.200 --> 14:53.200
34% of liberals at age 26 were conservatives at 50, but only 19% of the inverse.

14:53.200 --> 14:58.200
But these numbers still leave a large chunk of people who don't change politically at all.

14:58.200 --> 15:03.200
And as the study has repeatedly said, for most people, political viewpoint is relatively stable over time.

15:03.200 --> 15:07.200
However, and right now this is just my own hypothesis, I'm just spitballing here,

15:07.200 --> 15:11.200
we all know the left has been pushing the overtone window in their direction more and more.

15:11.200 --> 15:15.200
I'm sure we've all felt that feeling of being left behind by the left as they radicalize further.

15:15.200 --> 15:21.200
I'm sure we all experienced how our normal center-left opinions suddenly in a flash became conservative once.

15:21.200 --> 15:26.200
I know the online communists think I'm a Nazi, even though I've never actually changed my political beliefs.

15:26.200 --> 15:30.200
I'm sure we've all lost friends at this point because they radicalized and you didn't.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.200
I've certainly made multiple videos about it myself.

15:32.200 --> 15:39.200
The people who view the left-right scale as a sliding scale of good and evil view the extreme left as history's natural endpoint,

15:39.200 --> 15:42.200
and that the arrow of progress points eternally leftward over time.

15:42.200 --> 15:47.200
If you actually believe this, then forcing politics more leftward makes sense to you.

15:47.200 --> 15:51.200
It may be the case that in our current era of rapid political change,

15:51.200 --> 15:57.200
even those large swaths of people who don't become conservatives may nonetheless be labeled as them.

15:57.200 --> 16:01.200
It certainly explains why the radical progressives see the far right everywhere,

16:01.200 --> 16:03.200
even though almost none of them actually exist anymore.

16:03.200 --> 16:07.200
I'm not saying that people like Claudia Conway or Helena Duke don't have a point.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.200
They obviously do.

16:08.200 --> 16:12.200
When parents do bad things to their kids, even in the name of conservatism,

16:12.200 --> 16:15.200
even if that conservatism was predetermined by their genetics,

16:15.200 --> 16:20.200
even if that conservatism is a natural end result of life itself, that doesn't excuse those bad things.

16:20.200 --> 16:27.200
But the young leftist who moves out of their small town and away from their icky MAGA parents also doesn't really hold the high ground.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.200
What they're doing is also probably predetermined by their genetics,

16:30.200 --> 16:33.200
or is a natural end result of the current stage of development that they're on.

16:33.200 --> 16:38.200
The problem with everything I've talked about so far is that nothing here actually determines what is correct.

16:38.200 --> 16:42.200
Just because that when people change due to age, they're more likely to become conservative,

16:42.200 --> 16:47.200
and that change is more likely to be correlated with wisdom, experience, and the adoption of responsibility,

16:47.200 --> 16:50.200
doesn't mean that the conservative position is correct all the time.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.200
Just because young people are likely to feel the drive to be revolutionaries,

16:53.200 --> 16:58.200
and that drive is likely to be directly correlated to, and simultaneously fouled up by,

16:58.200 --> 17:03.200
their own inexperience, lack of deep ties to the world, and irresponsible lifestyle,

17:03.200 --> 17:08.200
that doesn't mean that history will move leftward over time, because the old people will die off and the leftists will rule everything.

17:08.200 --> 17:13.200
In the real world, sometimes the progressive is correct, sometimes the conservative is correct.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.200
It depends on the situation. It depends on the people involved.

17:16.200 --> 17:20.200
Progressives tend to think that they will conquer society because of their utopian vision and history is on their side.

17:20.200 --> 17:23.200
Conservatives tend to think that the kids don't know anything and need to stop mouthing off.

17:23.200 --> 17:28.200
But it seems to be that becoming more conservative over time, while not guaranteed,

17:28.200 --> 17:33.200
does happen more often than the inverse, and seems to happen partially because of the biology of the person,

17:33.200 --> 17:36.200
and partially because of the practical effects of the adoption of responsibility,

17:36.200 --> 17:40.200
the cultivation of meaningful personal relationships, and general maturation.

17:40.200 --> 17:43.200
And when the inverse happens, when people become more progressive over time,

17:43.200 --> 17:49.200
when they have that glow up as a response of moving away and getting out from under the thumb of their oppressive parents,

17:49.200 --> 17:54.200
that also seems to correlate with the lack of responsibility, the lack of meaningful relationships, and the lack of maturity.

17:54.200 --> 18:01.200
In other words, if you're a leftist, and you decide to self-improve, the data shows that you probably won't change political alignment at all.

18:01.200 --> 18:07.200
But, if on the off chance you do happen to change, it will likely be a shift rightward,

18:07.200 --> 18:12.200
because the lifestyle that fosters leftism is not compatible with the lifestyle that fosters self-improvement.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.200
That about does it for me guys, thank you for watching.

18:14.200 --> 18:18.200
I hope you now understand why I've been gone so long, I've been doing a lot of reading.

18:23.200 --> 18:27.200
And I stream every night on Twitch, so head over there after you've seen this too, I'm probably live.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.200
Thanks for watching, and hopefully I'll see you there.
