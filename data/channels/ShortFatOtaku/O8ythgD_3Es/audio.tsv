0	15200	Around this time last year, there was a flash-in-the-pan controversy surrounding then-senior counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway, and her 15-year-old daughter, Claudia.
15200	22200	Kellyanne is a lifelong conservative, was previously Trump's campaign manager, and has spent her career as a general Republican party strategist.
22200	36200	Her time in the White House was marred with controversy, ranging from relatively benign mis-speech, like the fictitious Bowling Green Massacre, and stuff like alternative facts, to actually unethical violations of the 1939 Hatch Act,
36200	45200	preventing members of the federal government from using the powers of their offices to influence elections or promote the businesses of family members of the president, both things that Kellyanne did repeatedly.
45200	51700	During this 2020 Conway controversy, Kellyanne and her husband George requested that the media keep their children out of the limelight.
51700	56700	After all, no matter what Kellyanne herself did, the kids aren't to blame, and it's kind of tacky to bring them into it.
56700	63200	But Claudia Conway, having her own platform as a TikTok influencer, decided to speak up anyway, saying of her father,
63200	67700	You're just mad that I'm finally getting my voice heard, and sorry your marriage failed.
67700	73700	Claudia's channel at the time was full of Black Lives Matter, socialist, ACAB, and anti-Trump content.
73700	75200	At one point she said,
75200	82200	If you're a woman supporting Trump, I feel bad for you. You must really hate yourself. Lots of internalized misogyny. Yikes.
82200	84700	Apparently meaning the message to be a jab at her mother.
84700	89200	Afterward, Claudia announced that she was seeking legal emancipation from her parents.
89200	96200	Six months later, Claudia posted a series of secretly recorded videos where Kellyanne was insulting her, berating her, and hitting her.
96200	99200	One fucking bit for you to tell people I'm a bitch.
99200	100200	What?
100200	101200	What?
101200	102200	What?
102200	104200	What?
104200	105200	There's something wrong with you.
105200	106200	Yeah, there is.
106200	107200	I'm mocking me.
107200	108200	You think I'm mocking you?
108200	110200	I'm trying to have a conversation with you.
110200	111200	Do you know what you've done to yourself?
111200	113200	Do you know what you've done to yourself?
113200	114200	50.
114200	115200	Yeah.
115200	116200	Fucking immature.
116200	118200	Before you get it all over the sheets that I clean.
118200	120200	Can you stop?
120200	121200	No, you don't ignore me.
121200	122200	Bitch.
122200	123200	Bitch.
123200	124200	Asshole.
124200	125200	Can my mom clean?
125200	126200	Can you please, mom?
126200	127200	No, you please.
127200	128200	I want you out of here.
128200	130200	You were making you mad.
130200	132200	Some 15-fucking-year-old made you mad.
132200	138200	These videos went viral, and shortly afterward, a topless picture of Claudia was posted to Kellyanne's official Twitter account.
138200	142200	Keep in mind that she's still 16 at this point, and the picture is quickly deleted.
142200	149200	We don't know who posted that pic, whether it was Kellyanne going even more off the rails, or Claudia framing her mom, or some hacker fucking around, or what.
149200	156200	The only thing we do know is that Claudia had taken a topless pic of herself, and for some reason that picture made its way to Kellyanne's account.
156200	160200	Of course, the police got involved, and since then the drama has seemed to calm down.
160200	168200	Kellyanne is still posting about her politics, Claudia is still on TikTok but only posting vapid teenager shit, but the political drama has basically disappeared.
168200	171200	If I had to guess, Claudia is just biding her time until she can move out.
171200	177200	It's a strange story because any sane person who watches these TikToks sees that Kellyanne is treating her daughter like shit.
177200	180200	At the same time, Claudia is living up that party lifestyle.
180200	184200	Drinking on the beach, driving around with her boyfriend in nice cars, appearing on TV.
196200	200200	She's a stereotypical Stacy with a Chad BF, and somebody's got to be paying for all this shit.
200200	208200	Also, even though she makes fun of OnlyFans for trying to recruit her on Twitter, she really seems to be easing into an OnlyFans Lite position on her account.
208200	213200	It almost seems like kids are grooming themselves for porn nowadays. Fucking hell.
213200	222200	The point is, this may be an extremely public high profile case, but it's something that a lot of progressive kids with conservative parents seem to be relating to right now.
222200	231200	Remember this story? Teresa Duke got slugged in the face during the January 6th Capitol riots, and her lesbian disowned daughter, Helena Duke, retweeted the video saying,
231200	237200	Hi mom, remember when you told me I shouldn't go to BLM protests because they could get violent? Is this you?
237200	240200	And it's like, fair enough. She's got you there, mom.
240200	250200	Teresa ended up losing her job over this, and Helena has since moved away to the big city, where she now lives with her girlfriend, talking about going to the hospital because she cut herself while trying to slice an avocado,
250200	254200	and how she wants to live in a commune because fuck capitalism, amirite?
254200	269200	This is a common enough thing. Conservative parents that are legitimately shitty to their kids, and radicalized, young leftist activists who view their parents as literally Hitler cutting them off, moving out of their small town, and then end up becoming extremists in their own right, only for the other team.
269200	273200	It seems to be crazier now more than it's ever been, but this effect has been seen for a while.
274200	284200	Old people look down on young people as lacking experience, or knowledge, or wisdom. Young people look down on old people for being too ancient in their thinking, and not updating their mental models to fit the current paradigm.
284200	292200	On some level, they're both correct. Young people think they're the vanguard of a new society, and as soon as the last old people are finally gone, they can remake things in their image.
292200	299200	Old people think that the kids are just being rowdy, and they'll settle down and become more conservative as they age, as that age makes them tougher and more competent.
300200	302200	And again, on some level, they're both correct.
302200	307200	That is some commonly repeated folk wisdom, by the way, that people get more conservative as they age.
307200	315200	Well, how true is it, actually? Conservatives love to lean on common sense in their online discussions, while progressives will often pull out this study.
315200	318200	Do people really become more conservative as they age?
318200	322200	Yeah, I had a double take on it, too. It's Jonathan Peterson, not Jordan Peterson.
322200	328200	But because it's online discussions, progressives rarely read past this sentence in the abstract.
328200	335200	Consistent with previous research, but contrary to folk wisdom, our results indicate that political attitudes are remarkably stable over the long term.
335200	338200	Of course, the very next sentence reads,
338200	342200	In contrast to previous research, however, we also find support for the folk wisdom.
343200	351200	On those occasions where political attitudes do shift across the lifespan, liberals are more likely to become conservatives than conservatives are to become liberals,
351200	356200	suggesting that folk wisdom has some empirical basis even as it overstates the degree of change.
356200	361200	In other words, people aren't likely to change over time, but if they do change, there's a higher chance they become more conservative.
361200	364200	The study itself describes the various reasons as to why this might be the case.
364200	366200	Firstly, there's psychological factors.
366200	370200	The tendency for age to bring with it increasing self-discipline and self-sufficiency.
370200	377200	Preference for order, avoidance of uncertainty, capacity to remember emotionally-laden stimuli, and alterations in neural structures that come with aging.
377200	381200	This also correlates with our understanding of fluid and crystallized intelligence.
381200	387200	Fluid intelligence slowly declines as we age, and we can observe this in a gradual drop-off of IQ across a person's life.
387200	392200	While crystallized intelligence remains constant, our ability to learn new things slowly disappears.
392200	399200	The things that we've already learned stick with us right up to the end, seemingly providing evidence for the idea that old people appear to be stuck in their ways.
399200	402200	The aging study also mentions that social aging plays a role.
402200	408200	Your social circle is primarily friends and peers and romantic partners sometimes up until you start a family,
408200	412200	and then it shifts to a more localized circle of family members and work acquaintances,
412200	417200	and then all social interaction drops off rapidly after retirement and the kids have left the nest.
417200	424200	There seems to be a correlation between the loss of naivete and idealism with the adoption of more and more responsibility as we grow older.
424200	426200	This view seems to be congruent with another paper.
427200	429200	Ideological differences in the expanse of the moral circle.
429200	432200	And yes, that's the actual Jonathan Haidt involved this time.
432200	438200	By the way, because these are all American studies, they use liberal to refer to left and conservative to refer to right.
438200	440200	I hate how Americans have ruined language.
440200	443200	Liberals, progressives, and socialists are not the same thing.
443200	449200	But the point is, the more leftward people go, the more likely it is that they prioritize friends over family and the planet over the nation.
449200	452200	And the more rightward people go, the opposite effect happens.
452200	456200	For example, the love of friends remains constant across the political spectrum,
456200	460200	but love of family goes up on the right and love of world goes up on the left,
460200	466200	such that on the extreme left, people slightly prefer the planet over their friends and both significantly more than their family.
466200	469200	You can chart a similar trend between nationalist and globalist values.
469200	475200	You can even show that the extreme left slightly prefers non-human life over human life,
475200	478200	while the rest of the spectrum, even the center left, prefers humanity.
478200	481200	The most telling part of the study, in my opinion, is this heat map.
481200	488200	Each person was given 100 moral units to assign to 16 areas of concern, represented by these 16 concentric circles,
488200	493200	with each circle being a slightly more universalized area of concern than the previous.
493200	496200	Circle 1, right in the center, is all of your immediate family.
496200	498200	Circle 2 is your extended family.
498200	503200	Circle 3 is your close friends, then your distant friends, your acquaintances, all the people you've ever met,
503200	509200	all citizens of your country, all people on your continent, all humans, all mammals, all animals,
509200	515200	all living things on Earth, including amoeba, all animals in the universe, including undiscovered alien life,
515200	519200	all living things in the universe, including alien amoeba, plants, and trees,
519200	525200	all things in the universe, including non-living things like space rocks, and finally, the universe itself.
525200	530200	Each participant had to divide up their 100 moral units to each of these 16 areas of concern.
530200	538200	The heat map shows that the conservatives, on average, placed the majority of their moral units on circles 3 and 4, their close and distant friends,
538200	546200	while liberals placed the majority of theirs on circle 14, all living things in the universe, including alien amoeba, plants, and trees.
546200	551200	Moreover, conservatives were more likely to spread their moral units out a little bit more than the liberals,
551200	558200	with the highest value on the liberal heat map being 20 units in one location, while the highest value on the conservative heat map was 12.
558200	565200	The liberals were more likely to crowd their moral units on the more universalist domains, while the conservatives crowded them on localist ones.
565200	572200	Comparing the extremes, your average conservative cares more about his immediate family and his close friends than the universe or any random amoeba in it,
572200	578200	and your average liberal cares about the inverse, more about the universe and its random amoeba than his immediate family or close friends.
578200	583200	And even though humans do actually only have so much moral consideration to pass around,
583200	589200	just to ensure that their results weren't the product of artificially limiting the amount of concern they have at 100 units,
589200	596200	they replicated the test with an infinite amount of moral units, and despite it being infinite, the distribution ended up the same.
596200	600200	Putting aside the, um, more obvious implications of this study for now,
600200	605200	this lines up with the aging studies assertion that your moral concerns change as your social circles do.
605200	611200	When you're young and moving around for work or school and traveling a lot and living this cosmopolitan lifestyle,
611200	618200	where you form no real lasting social bonds, your moral attention will be allocated more towards universalist concerns.
618200	624200	When you're a bit older and you have a family and a house and a job, your moral attention will be allocated towards more localist concerns.
624200	631200	And since moral attention correlates with political leanings, it's no surprise that living a more normal life would make people more conservative.
631200	634200	The aging study also brings up some more obvious points.
634200	638200	An older person who has had a successful career has seen his wealth grow over time due to that hard work,
638200	642200	and one, doesn't want his wealth to be stolen by redistributive efforts,
642200	647200	and two, doesn't understand the complaints of the poor young person, because he was also once a poor young person and he worked and made money.
647200	649200	So they too will work and make money.
649200	654200	Being poor and young and then older with money is exactly how you want a functioning society to work.
654200	659200	It means that you're able to produce the necessary excess resources for your future self to live on when you can't work anymore.
659200	664200	However, the aging study does bring up one good point against the trending conservative hypothesis,
664200	669200	that older people have more health problems and therefore that need might drive people towards more left-leaning,
669200	674200	redistributive policies concerning universal healthcare or social security as they get older.
674200	680200	At this point, the aging study spends an entire page getting into the nitty-gritty of citing and explaining many other studies,
680200	684200	most of which conclude that political views remain generally stable over time.
684200	689200	This view lines up with the conclusion of a completely different paper, genetic influences on political ideologies.
689200	698200	Here, an aggregation of twin studies was used to determine that between 30-60% of the variants in social and political attitudes can be explained by genetic influences,
698200	701200	but also that the search for a politics gene was fruitless,
701200	705200	because thousands of genes influence the biological component of a person's natural political leaning.
705200	710200	It seems that, speaking very generally, a significant portion of our politics comes from our biology,
710200	713200	and also that our politics are not likely to change across our lifespan.
713200	715200	Let's look at the aging study's data.
715200	722200	When people's political attitudes did change, they were more likely to change between the ages of 26-35 rather than 36-50.
722200	730200	The only statistically significant political change from 36-50 was the ideological label people identified as publicly rather than any policy position.
730200	737200	In other words, when people do become more conservative as they age, they're more likely to adopt conservative positions between 26-35,
737200	742200	but not actually likely to identify as a conservative until between 36-50.
742200	746200	This lines up with the adoption of responsibility and the changing of social circles that we talked about earlier,
746200	749200	but it also lines up with Piaget's stages of cognitive development.
749200	756200	Piaget developed this theory by noticing that children were not just tiny adults, but actually thought in fundamentally different ways than adults.
756200	761200	He identified four stages of cognitive development, sensory motor, which ranges from birth to two years,
761200	765200	pre-operational, which is two to seven, concrete operational, which is seven to eleven,
765200	770200	and formal operational, which is twelve to the end of puberty and beginning of concrete adulthood,
770200	772200	which is variable and happens all over the twenties.
772200	776200	We're concerned with the formal operational stage, twelve to adulthood.
776200	780200	This is where the person finally shows the beginning of fully abstract thinking,
780200	785200	and undergoes a general awakening to the existence of morality, philosophy, ethics, and politics.
785200	788200	Piaget referred to this stage colloquially as the Messianic stage,
788200	792200	as what often comes with it is a desire to change the world for the better.
792200	793200	And that makes sense to me.
793200	798200	Of course, a thinking being's first encounter with morality, philosophy, ethics, and politics
798200	803200	would be to use their newfound skills to notice problems and feel a desire to fix them.
803200	806200	You'd have to be a sociopath not to feel that way, I think.
806200	812200	Jens Roggemann from the University of Hamburg published a series of notes for a future study that is unfortunately not finished yet,
812200	814200	talking in detail about the Messianic stage.
814200	818200	Young people are prone to adopt idealistic and utopian ideologies,
818200	821200	which they reassert with an almost religious fanaticism.
821200	824200	But due to their lack of experience and their egocentric worldview,
824200	827200	they tend to underestimate the difficulties of implementing their ideas
827200	831200	while being blind to the backlash of their attempts in a real-world setting.
831200	833200	Does this sound familiar to you yet?
833200	838200	We've all had that socialist roommate who wanted to implement broad sweeping changes to reorder the world,
838200	841200	but somehow that never actually extended to him doing his own dishes.
841200	843200	And of course, we've all seen its inverse too.
843200	849200	The old Fox News-watching aunt who loves her family dearly but blames all of society's problems on those damn immigrants.
849200	853200	Everything I've talked about today seems to point at one conclusion.
853200	856200	While leftists and rightists both have their blind spots,
856200	859200	the problems associated with leftism are correlated with youth,
859200	862200	simultaneously its desire for change and its lack of discipline,
862200	865200	while the problems with rightism are correlated with age,
865200	869200	its inability to adopt new information or understand problems larger than a local scale.
869200	872200	Going back to the aging study, we can really hammer this point home.
872200	878200	When movement does occur with age, the bias is towards a more conservative ideological posture.
878200	884200	This is apparent both in moderates, where those moderates who did change were three times more likely to become conservatives than to become liberals,
884200	888200	as well as in the imbalance of ideological movement for liberals and conservatives.
888200	893200	34% of liberals at age 26 were conservatives at 50, but only 19% of the inverse.
893200	898200	But these numbers still leave a large chunk of people who don't change politically at all.
898200	903200	And as the study has repeatedly said, for most people, political viewpoint is relatively stable over time.
903200	907200	However, and right now this is just my own hypothesis, I'm just spitballing here,
907200	911200	we all know the left has been pushing the overtone window in their direction more and more.
911200	915200	I'm sure we've all felt that feeling of being left behind by the left as they radicalize further.
915200	921200	I'm sure we all experienced how our normal center-left opinions suddenly in a flash became conservative once.
921200	926200	I know the online communists think I'm a Nazi, even though I've never actually changed my political beliefs.
926200	930200	I'm sure we've all lost friends at this point because they radicalized and you didn't.
930200	932200	I've certainly made multiple videos about it myself.
932200	939200	The people who view the left-right scale as a sliding scale of good and evil view the extreme left as history's natural endpoint,
939200	942200	and that the arrow of progress points eternally leftward over time.
942200	947200	If you actually believe this, then forcing politics more leftward makes sense to you.
947200	951200	It may be the case that in our current era of rapid political change,
951200	957200	even those large swaths of people who don't become conservatives may nonetheless be labeled as them.
957200	961200	It certainly explains why the radical progressives see the far right everywhere,
961200	963200	even though almost none of them actually exist anymore.
963200	967200	I'm not saying that people like Claudia Conway or Helena Duke don't have a point.
967200	968200	They obviously do.
968200	972200	When parents do bad things to their kids, even in the name of conservatism,
972200	975200	even if that conservatism was predetermined by their genetics,
975200	980200	even if that conservatism is a natural end result of life itself, that doesn't excuse those bad things.
980200	987200	But the young leftist who moves out of their small town and away from their icky MAGA parents also doesn't really hold the high ground.
987200	990200	What they're doing is also probably predetermined by their genetics,
990200	993200	or is a natural end result of the current stage of development that they're on.
993200	998200	The problem with everything I've talked about so far is that nothing here actually determines what is correct.
998200	1002200	Just because that when people change due to age, they're more likely to become conservative,
1002200	1007200	and that change is more likely to be correlated with wisdom, experience, and the adoption of responsibility,
1007200	1010200	doesn't mean that the conservative position is correct all the time.
1010200	1013200	Just because young people are likely to feel the drive to be revolutionaries,
1013200	1018200	and that drive is likely to be directly correlated to, and simultaneously fouled up by,
1018200	1023200	their own inexperience, lack of deep ties to the world, and irresponsible lifestyle,
1023200	1028200	that doesn't mean that history will move leftward over time, because the old people will die off and the leftists will rule everything.
1028200	1033200	In the real world, sometimes the progressive is correct, sometimes the conservative is correct.
1033200	1036200	It depends on the situation. It depends on the people involved.
1036200	1040200	Progressives tend to think that they will conquer society because of their utopian vision and history is on their side.
1040200	1043200	Conservatives tend to think that the kids don't know anything and need to stop mouthing off.
1043200	1048200	But it seems to be that becoming more conservative over time, while not guaranteed,
1048200	1053200	does happen more often than the inverse, and seems to happen partially because of the biology of the person,
1053200	1056200	and partially because of the practical effects of the adoption of responsibility,
1056200	1060200	the cultivation of meaningful personal relationships, and general maturation.
1060200	1063200	And when the inverse happens, when people become more progressive over time,
1063200	1069200	when they have that glow up as a response of moving away and getting out from under the thumb of their oppressive parents,
1069200	1074200	that also seems to correlate with the lack of responsibility, the lack of meaningful relationships, and the lack of maturity.
1074200	1081200	In other words, if you're a leftist, and you decide to self-improve, the data shows that you probably won't change political alignment at all.
1081200	1087200	But, if on the off chance you do happen to change, it will likely be a shift rightward,
1087200	1092200	because the lifestyle that fosters leftism is not compatible with the lifestyle that fosters self-improvement.
1092200	1094200	That about does it for me guys, thank you for watching.
