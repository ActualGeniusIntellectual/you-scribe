0	16760	Let's talk about Unity, because that's been a pretty fun rollercoaster recently.
16760	22500	Back in 2005, three indie developers based out of Denmark founded the game studio Over
22500	27160	the Edge Entertainment and put out their very first game, the arcade puzzler Goo Ball for
27160	28160	Mac OS X.
28760	32240	There's nothing really remarkable about it, it's just a Super Monkey Ball knockoff, but
32240	36880	it was downloaded tons of times and it was one of the most popular games on the platform.
36880	41400	However, this popularity didn't translate into commercial success for the company.
41400	45320	Additionally, Over the Edge Entertainment had spent a significant amount of time building
45320	50580	custom tools to make the game, since Mac OS X didn't really have anything for game development.
50580	54740	Sensing a way to solve their financial problems, the company bundled its game dev tools into
54740	59280	one application and sold it as the Unity game engine, the first modern game engine
59280	61500	made specifically for Apple hardware.
61500	66280	With the explosive success of the iPhone two years later, the Unity engine was perfectly
66280	70420	poised to capitalize on the emerging market of smartphone games.
70420	74640	Over the Edge Entertainment soon after changed their name to Unity Technologies.
74640	79900	As Unity expanded beyond Apple's ecosystem, with versions for Android, consoles, and computers,
79900	84440	it became the go-to choice for a lot of developers, especially if they lacked experience with
84440	85580	game development.
85580	90220	By 2012, over half of all mobile developers were using Unity to make their phone games,
90220	93020	and Unity had hit 1 million registered users.
93020	96900	By 2016, they had 5.5 million registered users.
96900	101260	It basically became the next step up from the old RPG Maker applications of the early
101260	102280	2000s.
102280	106020	That was just a very simplistic game dev engine, and the only thing you could make with it
106020	109120	were basically just Dragon Quest ripoffs.
109120	113580	A lot of 90s kids who wanted to make games tinkered around with RPG Maker, including
113580	118260	myself, I have a lot of old, deep RPG Maker lore still stuffed in my head.
118260	122820	And many of those kids who did become indie devs in their 20s moved on to Unity for its
122820	124380	similar ease of use.
124380	130820	Unity's first big gangbuster title was Pokemon Go in 2016, after which the company's valuation
130820	131860	skyrocketed.
131860	134520	They went through several rounds of venture capital funding.
134520	138640	They started putting out asset libraries and software development kits and VR software
138640	140660	in order to further streamline game development.
140740	143300	They've been making big deals with Facebook and Google.
143300	146540	They've been buying out other companies like Vivox, a voice chat provider.
146540	150620	They've been massively expanding their business with new employees and branches.
150620	155340	And while it is paying off, Unity did post revenue of over half a billion dollars back
155340	156520	in 2019.
156520	161380	They have consistently operated at a loss every single year since their founding.
161380	166100	In September of 2020, Unity Technologies went public, with an estimated market value of
166100	168660	$13.7 billion.
168660	172740	The company continued on its growth spree, buying up smaller companies left and right,
172740	178100	expanding into markets everywhere between 2020 and 2022, leading us to the current 2023
178100	179100	controversy.
179100	182860	The story of Unity is one that seems pretty familiar to anybody who knows about the world
182860	183860	of tech startups.
183860	188640	A highly successful company offering an immensely popular product, but due to its own hubris
188640	193900	and bloat, fails to achieve profitability, even as they grow and become a household name.
193940	199080	On September 12th, 2023, Unity announced a change to their business model, adding new
199080	202980	fees to their subscription plans, and the addition of a runtime fee.
202980	207660	They clarified that it is indeed a price increase, but also that most Unity members won't be
207660	211140	affected by it, as most Unity users don't pay anything at all.
211140	215180	The only developers who will be affected are those who have successful games, and are generating
215180	218800	revenues way above what Unity considers to be its threshold.
218800	223020	The runtime fee install counter starts on January 1st, 2024.
223020	228780	It is not retroactive, but they will charge the game developer once for every new install
228780	230140	of a Unity game.
230140	234560	Unity insists that they look for ways to not do this, but it seems like their perpetual
234560	237500	financial troubles have finally forced their hand.
237500	238780	Here's the threshold table.
238780	242140	Basically, if you don't meet these thresholds, you won't be charged.
242140	248340	For Unity Personal and Unity Plus, you need $200,000 in revenue and 200,000 installs.
248340	252340	For Unity Pro and Enterprise, it's $1 million and 1 million installs.
252340	256200	I don't know if they intend for this to be that you have to hit both thresholds or just
256200	257620	one, it's ambiguous.
257620	261340	Once you're over the threshold, though, Unity Personal and Unity Plus developers will be
261340	266240	charged 20 cents for every install of their game, while Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise
266240	269140	have a bunch of tiers for various install levels.
269140	273620	Unity's confirmed that it's not every sale of a game, but every install of a game, meaning
273620	278460	that hypothetically a customer could re-download the game on multiple computers, and the developer
278460	281140	would be charged by Unity for every install.
281140	285740	They literally made this 4chan meme real, where the company loses money for every install.
285740	288860	Everybody realized that this was going to be a shitshow pretty much right away, and
288860	292860	after a massive public backlash, Unity came out with a second statement.
292860	297260	They clarified that demos will mostly not trigger a fee, developers won't be on the
297260	301620	hook for game pass downloads, and that they're rolling back that whole install scheme, saying
301620	303980	that only the first install will count.
303980	307460	If that's the case, why not just make it a cut of revenue from sales, dude?
307460	310860	One thing I will say, though, is that the public reaction to this whole mess got one
310860	312580	critical thing wrong.
312580	316540	Unity never said that the install fees would be retroactively applied, but everybody started
316540	317980	acting like it would've.
317980	322420	For example, this tweet went viral of an indie developer whose two games totaled 20 million
322420	326220	in sales, and how he now apparently owes Unity over 5 million dollars.
326220	329620	Yeah, that's pretty funny, and it's a pretty good way to hitch your brand to the latest
329620	334420	outrage train, but if the install fee only actually starts in 2024, this guy's fine.
334420	338940	However, Unity is potentially stepping on the toes of some very big players in the gaming
338940	340380	industry by doing this.
340380	345460	Genshin Impact uses Unity, Blizzard's Hearthstone uses Unity, Nintendo's Pokemon Diamond and
345460	347300	Pearl remakes use Unity.
347300	352180	If these companies start getting charged for every install of their games starting in 2024,
352180	354540	you can bet there will be lawsuits.
354540	358540	So let's actually examine that whole multiple installs thing in depth.
358540	361340	Here is the pro-Unity interpretation of events.
361340	365460	The general manager of Unity Create, which is a subdivision of Unity, Mark Whitten, was
365460	369760	interviewed about the controversy by Jason Wyman, a game developer who uses Unity.
369760	373960	One of the questions Whitten was asked was which group of their users would be the most
373960	376180	affected by the new pricing changes.
376180	380900	Before the way that Unity personal worked is you could use it up to $100,000 of revenue
380900	382240	for your company.
382240	386780	Now it's $200,000, so twice the size, so it's easier to use for more people, covers
386780	389820	more cases, and it's more flexible.
389820	391800	So that's number one.
391800	396100	Not a part of the program, totally free, majority of our users, and a lot more flexibility.
396100	403060	So the runtime fee applies for people who are over both a million dollars in sort of
403060	408620	trailing 12 months revenue money they've made over the last year on kind of an ongoing basis,
408620	413740	and a million engagements with new users, essentially.
413740	415780	And for those users, they're following changes.
415780	423100	The first one is this is with next year's LTS, which would be what is 2023 LTS, shipping
423100	424240	in 2024.
424240	428820	So it doesn't impact any games that have currently shipped, and it doesn't impact the games people
428820	432760	may have already been working on for a very, very long period of time.
432760	436700	One of the most, I think, really key pieces of feedback we heard is that it was a really
436700	441460	big business model change that people didn't expect.
441460	446020	And so it's very clear to us that having it start on a future version where everybody
446020	449660	can make the choice to use it is really, really important.
449660	453780	The second that we heard along with that is that people need to know that they can rely
453780	456880	on a set of terms when they start using a version of Unity.
456880	460020	So we're going to make sure that that's the case.
460020	465620	There are even some pieces about that, things like the GitHub repo that, by the way, I will
465620	469780	just say prior to last week, I did not know existed.
470020	473900	Now I know a lot about, and we're making sure, I think it's already back up there, it has
473900	475020	all of them in there.
475020	479260	Obviously, our website will always have our legal terms and terms of service and all of
479260	483140	those sorts of things, but we're going to make sure it's also on the GitHub so people
483140	484220	can track that.
484220	489880	And then the last that I would talk about is when you are using this future version
489880	495360	of Unity, you have a game that's over the million dollars, million engagements, that
495360	504220	there's a choice between either a 2.5% revenue share or measuring based on this calculated
504220	508660	amount of initial user engagements that you can do.
508660	514720	And if you do both of those, you'll always be billed the lesser of whatever that calculation
514720	515720	is, but it's also up to you.
515720	519260	If you only wanted to do one of them, leave the box blank, whatever.
519260	525020	And again, that's only for those games that were over those thresholds.
525680	529260	Sorry, one more minute, you asked me.
529260	531640	And then the other key part on that one is it's self-reported.
531640	536000	So it's both numbers being self-reported, both on the revenue side and on the user engagements.
536000	538860	Yeah, I think that's a big one.
538860	542480	I think there are a couple of questions about that that we'll get into, but I think the
542480	547520	self-reporting and the mix up around there is a big one that I think people would be
547520	548520	pretty happy with.
548520	551080	If Witten's telling the truth, this sounds pretty good.
551080	553680	The vast majority of users won't be affected at all.
553680	558000	The next question was about how the multiple installs would be tracked, and Witten replied
558000	561060	that basically the whole thing is going to be on the honor system.
561060	565580	How will you track what version of Unity developers are using, or is that something you're even
565580	567260	going to track?
567260	571620	You know what version of Unity that you're using, and we're going to make sure that you're
571620	575960	clear, like what terms are associated with that particular version.
575960	580340	This is actually, frankly, the same as actually Unity Personal.
580340	586760	When we say that you can use Unity Personal up to $200,000, we're also not tracking that.
586760	592180	We're just telling you that this is what the rights are associated with this version so
592180	598000	that you know, and then obviously if we find out that you're doing it, we have a conversation,
598000	599400	but you know.
599400	604480	Yeah, so there's not an extra tracking or anything added in, which I kind of assumed.
604480	609320	I figured it would be just like the current setup where you use Unity Free, and then eventually
609320	613700	you upgrade to Pro unless you don't like to follow the rules, and maybe if you get
613700	617340	super huge or something, somebody at Unity might hit you up.
617340	621960	Just to real quick clarify one more time for everybody, on the counting of those, that's
621960	626060	just you're going in, now make sure I understand this right, I'm just going into like Steam
626060	631700	and saying, hey, I sold this many, subtracting my refunds from that, and putting that in.
631700	632700	Subtract refunds, exactly.
632700	633700	Yeah.
633700	634700	Okay, yeah.
634700	635700	That's kind of what I expected.
635700	636700	Yeah, those are my things.
636700	637700	Yes.
637700	638700	Okay.
639080	643760	I've reported based on data that you easily have available, not sort of like I have to
643760	648560	track some sort of user behavior that's different than I've ever done or anything like that.
648560	652620	You don't have to go add in analytics or some tracking or anything, you just look at whatever
652620	655220	your numbers are and then put those into the page.
655220	659400	That's kind of been what I expected from the start, but it was definitely, I'll be honest,
659400	663320	it was very unclear because it said there was a proprietary algorithm in there.
663320	668520	I feel like those two words made the thing drastically more confusing and led to a lot
668520	669520	of speculation.
669520	672060	Even for me, I don't know what that means.
672060	673620	Yeah, you're right.
673620	677840	And we want to be super clear that self-reporting, and by the way, on both, both the revenue
677840	679940	side and on that is really key.
679940	684860	It's why this program is very important, but we're trying to make sure that this is easy
684860	687380	for our game creators as well.
687380	688380	Yeah.
688380	689380	No, that's good.
689380	694100	I mean, that seems like data that, at least I've always had, if you sell games and have
694100	697700	people download them, you've got the info on how many are downloading it or how much
697700	699080	money you're making each month.
699080	703520	So, that seems relatively straightforward and a lot better than some built-in tracking
703520	706320	spyware thing that I kept hearing about.
706320	707320	Yeah.
707320	711080	And again, I'm sorry that I had to use the corporate jargon, but the truth is there's
711080	713160	just a lot of different scenarios in games.
713160	716080	And so, some people might say, why isn't it sales?
716080	718240	But sales doesn't work if it's a free-to-play game.
718240	723300	And so, we're trying to make sure that we can clearly define that in a way that works
723300	726580	for a bunch of different ways that Unity's used.
726580	728640	This seems pretty above board too.
728640	733020	Unity will require game developers to self-report their statistics on sales numbers and revenue
733020	737200	and number of installs, all of which Steam's backend provides to the developer.
737200	738760	Xbox's backend provides them.
738760	740700	Most storefronts provide these numbers.
740700	744880	This does mean there's a possibility that lying developers can inaccurately report their
744880	745880	numbers.
745880	749120	And Witten does say that if there's obvious huge discrepancies, like if a game with 10
749120	753400	million players reports to Unity 10,000 sales, they reserve the right to approach the game
753400	754620	developer about it.
754640	759320	But for the most part, they intend to just roll with self-reporting on revenue and installs.
759320	764360	Witten also clarified what was meant by an install and admits that Unity did a very bad
764360	766560	job at explaining what they meant to do.
766560	767560	That's an understatement.
784620	797200	Yeah, and I'm going to sound a little corporatey here for a second while I use the words around
797200	800720	it, but I'm just going to use them and then try to explain them a little bit.
800720	807280	And that's, you know, the goal is as simple as saying that it's a legitimate user of your
807280	810640	software on a particular distribution channel.
810640	812640	So okay, what's a legitimate user?
812660	818900	Well, a legitimate user would be an actual user, not your automated use, not whether
818900	824060	there was piracy, not someone that had bought it and instantly refunded it, but like a legitimate
824060	829340	first time that someone was engaging with your free-to-play game or your paid game.
829340	830540	What's a distribution channel?
830540	832980	Well, an app store is a distribution channel.
832980	840500	So if that user went to a particular store and bought it or downloaded it or whatever,
841000	843040	then you would start thinking of that as sort of doing it.
843040	848520	Now if they had multiple devices or they reinstalled it, you don't count those multiple times.
848520	851680	Because I might have gotten the same thing in my library from a store that I can use
851680	854000	on a couple of different devices, great.
854000	855720	That's one, not two.
855720	861420	So there's a bunch more examples that are around that in the FAQ and we're very committed
861420	864080	to making sure that we give more details around that.
864080	872060	But our intent is very simple, which is that the first time that your game with our runtime
872060	877340	engages with a very legitimate user on a distribution channel, use that as account.
877340	884940	And then again, we think that many times that will be much less than this 2.5% revenue share.
884940	888980	And so you could pay less or less through that, or you just go to the revenue share
888980	890820	if you didn't want to track that.
890820	894880	Whitten also went into detail on why they went with a fee for an install rather than
894880	896360	a fee for a sale.
896360	900160	Why was there a whole install thing in the beginning anyway?
900160	902860	We think it's going to be cheaper for a lot of games.
902860	908520	So listen, we're trying to build a model that we think is fair and is a good value exchange
908520	913400	that works for games once they find a level of success.
913400	918960	And we also want to tie it to this value that Unity brings, which is our runtime that's
918960	921600	inside of the games themselves.
921600	924980	And so it felt like a way where we could tie those two pieces together.
924980	931940	And we think that in a pretty reasonable number of cases, that that's actually a smaller number.
931940	933340	And we think that's good.
933340	937820	Now what we heard, got a lot of really, really good feedback is that there were cases where
937820	941160	people first off couldn't plan because they're like, well, I don't know, maybe something's
941160	945840	going to go crazy or I have this particular scenario and that doesn't work.
945840	951260	And so adding in the 2.5% revenue share as an option, you can only use that, or where
951260	952260	you have the both.
952260	958060	And so you can always plan for it and hopefully do better, definitely was, frankly, my opinion
958060	962200	makes the plan better based on what we were trying to do.
962200	963600	So it was really good feedback.
963600	970140	Yeah, I was, to be honest, I said this in my streams earlier that the idea of being
970140	974540	forced on a rev share doesn't sound appealing to me, but I've come from the background of
974540	980540	MMOs and, you know, 50, $60 AAA games where a small install fee, we're looking at less
980540	982320	than 1% or a 1% fee.
982320	988000	So I like the option of both, but yeah, I haven't understood the argument of just force
988000	989000	a rev share.
989000	992320	So hopefully that doesn't change and we stay with both options.
992320	994040	I assume that's the plan.
994040	997620	Oh, that's absolutely the plan or the plan is that choice.
997620	1001860	This actually sounds reasonable, like, yeah, free to play games would have no game sales
1001860	1002860	they could cut off.
1002860	1007300	Also people who just own a ton of random steam games from sales or humble bundles or something,
1007300	1010360	but never actually play them, they won't trigger a fee either.
1010360	1013220	By the way, I have a humble bundle affiliate link in the description, make sure to use
1013220	1014400	it to buy your games.
1014400	1018180	Basically, I know that it's Witten's job to put his company's best foot forward.
1018180	1022500	He's obviously not impartial here, but he did offer an apology and some decent reasons
1022500	1025440	as to why Unity decided to change their payment structure.
1025440	1029840	But there is a second possible reason, one that isn't quite so above board.
1029840	1033460	Remember when I mentioned that Unity was gobbling up companies left and right?
1033460	1038180	Well, their expansion led them to buy out IronSource back in July of 2022.
1038180	1041120	It's a bit tricky to figure out what IronSource actually does.
1041120	1044440	Their Wikipedia page lists them as a mobile games company, but they don't seem to have
1044440	1045720	put out any games.
1045720	1049420	Their website says, one platform to turn your app into a business.
1049420	1053940	Our platform lets you focus on what you do best, creating great apps and user experiences
1053940	1055540	while we take care of the rest.
1055540	1060120	Get the IronSource SDK to start monetizing your app and acquiring quality users.
1060120	1062240	SDK just stands for Software Development Kit.
1062240	1064800	Basically, it's a set of tools you can use to make a program.
1064800	1068800	So alright, they sell tools that developers use to make games, just like Unity.
1068800	1073480	IronSource used to sell their tools back in 2011 under the name InstallCore, and InstallCore
1073480	1075240	has a sordid history.
1075240	1080560	Various anti-virus and anti-malware applications began to label InstallCore as malware starting
1080560	1082120	in 2014.
1082140	1085820	InstallCore was an application that allowed those using it to include monetization in
1085820	1089640	their programs through advertising, as well as making it possible to charge companies
1089640	1092260	per installation through install tracking.
1092260	1096020	It could also add toolbars to your internet browser that were difficult to remove, record
1096020	1100140	your computer's processes, and send that data back home, and it was also the main reason
1100140	1103420	that when you went to install a legitimate application, you often found that a whole
1103420	1106260	bunch of other garbage got installed along with it.
1106260	1110660	InstallCore became one of the most infamous bits of malware of the 2010s.
1110680	1114960	InstallCore was phased out in 2020, having been replaced with the IronCore SDK, which
1114960	1116620	is basically just more of the same.
1116620	1119760	In fact, whenever you're on the Pirate Bay or some other torrent site or downloading
1119760	1123760	site, and you see a banner ad claiming to lead you to a Google Chrome install but actually
1123760	1128040	goes to some malware URL, that's generally IronCore's work.
1128040	1132080	If you were to click on one of those obvious links, IronCore would install a toolbar into
1132080	1135920	your browser that would display ads to you, track your internet usage, and lag the fuck
1135920	1137200	out of your PC.
1137380	1140960	Unity completed their buyout of IronSource in November of 2022.
1140960	1144940	As part of the deal, IronSource's CEO joined the Unity board of directors.
1144940	1148500	A few months later, the Unity board began the discussion of how to further monetize
1148500	1152060	Unity and eventually came up with the idea of a per-install fee.
1152060	1156060	It's not too much of a stretch to say that Unity, having just acquired a company that
1156060	1160740	specialized in tracking malware, might put that software to use in the tracking of their
1160740	1161740	users.
1161740	1166420	Right now, everybody's claiming Unity's now ex-CEO, John Risatello, for this whole
1166420	1167420	shit show.
1167420	1169860	There's a pretty convincing story for that interpretation of events.
1169860	1174020	Risatello was previously the CEO at EA, a gaming company that everyone's loved to
1174020	1176620	hate for about, I don't know, 30 years now.
1176620	1180980	He was brought into Unity back in 2014 and began to push for the company's aggressive
1180980	1181980	expansion.
1181980	1185900	During an interview, Risatello explained his logic behind Unity acquiring IronSource.
1197420	1203120	We realized we shared a common vision, and with Unity, most of the world's game content
1203120	1205220	is built on Unity.
1205220	1208420	We've also got a really strong monetization network.
1208420	1212980	And what we're trying to get to, you know, over the course of many years, is a platform
1212980	1218060	where a creator can make the best content and monetize the best content.
1218060	1222420	And sometimes monetization is harder than it is to build the great game.
1222420	1226060	If you don't have a great business to go with a great game, you don't have a great
1226060	1229340	game because you don't have the resources to make it.
1229340	1235080	And so here, what this is about is they have some tools that are pretty amazing that if
1235080	1240220	you add them to our stack, we can get to a place where a creator can get user feedback
1240220	1242900	on pieces of the game along the way.
1242900	1248660	So they know how the game or the digital twin or whatever the real-time 3D content is made
1248660	1249660	to be.
1250660	1255620	And they get feedback on user engagement and what's working, not working, and not working,
1255620	1260460	and also simultaneously get feedback on what it takes to acquire a user.
1260460	1267940	So the outgrowth of a unified creation and growth platform that we could put together
1267940	1273860	is really better content and a better business in a way that we think is really magical for
1273860	1274860	creators.
1274860	1278560	While I'm sure there's certainly some very positive uses for IronSource's tracking tools,
1278560	1282720	he does make a good case for them, it's also very easy to see how it's not all sunshine
1282720	1286760	and rainbows, where Satello went into more detail on the data front, specifically saying
1286760	1288120	more data is good.
1308560	1312520	means we're not dependent on any one data source, and so they've got a lot of different
1312520	1314560	data sources and so do we.
1314560	1317880	It's a large number, I can list them if you want.
1317880	1322520	The second is they've got a leading mediation tool, which is an important part of a full
1322520	1325560	stack monetization platform.
1325560	1331840	We will bring more data, more demand to that platform, and that's helpful to both companies.
1331840	1334280	Again, customers win, we win.
1334280	1339160	And third, they've got a set of publishing tools that they call SuperSonic.
1339160	1341360	And it's a great solution for the long tail.
1341360	1344960	Firstly, everybody in the long tail makes their games on Unity.
1344960	1350120	This is one of those peanut butter and chocolate mixes where we've got the customer that they
1350120	1353580	need, they've got the solution we need, and we see strong synergy in that.
1353580	1358420	When Unity went public back in September of 2020, a few choice groups bought up a significant
1358420	1359580	amount of their stock.
1359580	1363280	A lot of people who follow stock ownership conspiracies will likely recognize some of
1363280	1364280	these names.
1364280	1367720	Sequoia Capital, Silver Lake Management, The Vanguard Group.
1367720	1372560	Ironsource was even praised by the World Economic Forum as one of their preferred global growth
1372560	1373560	companies.
1373560	1376440	Okay, I'm not going to be diving into the Klaus Schwab rabbit hole today, I'm not prepared
1376440	1377440	for it right now.
1377440	1379000	And frankly, I don't think I believe a lot of it.
1379000	1382560	I'm bringing this up because the CEO of a public company serves at the pleasure of the
1382560	1383880	shareholder board.
1383880	1387240	Even if Risatello disagreed with the Ironsource merger, and he probably didn't, he wasn't
1387240	1391240	in a position to actually reject it, considering that Silver Lake and Sequoia announced an
1391240	1395720	additional $1 billion of investment into the company if they took the deal.
1395720	1400160	Risatello sold 2,000 Unity shares six days before the pricing announcement.
1400160	1402640	He's been selling shares of Unity all year.
1402640	1405040	Other executives at Unity have been doing the same.
1405040	1408880	I think people at Unity have a feeling that things are starting to go belly up, despite
1408880	1410440	their public statements otherwise.
1410440	1414420	And now that Unity's had a spectacular PR blowout, Risatello has probably decided that
1414420	1416680	now is the time for him to step down.
1416680	1419960	What's likely is that he saw the writing on the wall, cashed out, and abandoned the sinking
1419960	1420960	ship.
1420960	1424160	He may have been the accidental orchestrator of this disaster, and decided to cut his losses
1424160	1425160	and leave.
1425160	1428320	He might have objected to the merger and been overruled by the owners of Unity, and now
1428320	1430560	he's taken off before things really go tits up.
1430560	1434400	Either way, he's gone, and the internet has certainly decided to blame him for everything.
1434400	1439040	By the way, I personally believe that the Ironsource malware tracking story is probably
1439040	1443200	more likely than the Mark Ritten, everything is totally cool story, because Unity announced
1443200	1448000	that it will quietly waive all of those fees if game developers switch to their in-game
1448000	1449820	ad monetization service.
1449820	1452820	Another bit of software that came along with the Ironsource acquisition.
1452820	1458180	Oh, also because of that $1 billion invested from Sequoia and Silver Lake to make that
1458180	1463100	Ironsource deal go down smoothly, a chunk of it probably went towards executive compensation
1463100	1464100	packages.
1464100	1469100	$45 million over three years for Risatello, and $47 million over two years to Ritten,
1469100	1470620	not to mention the other executives.
1470620	1475220	Neil Long, reporting for the website Mobile Gamer, was contacted by sources within Unity
1475220	1476500	about the whole fiasco.
1476500	1479540	They are anonymous sources, presumably because they don't want to lose their jobs, so take
1479580	1480740	this with a grain of salt.
1480740	1484260	This was published only a few days ago on October 23rd, and it seems to be the most
1484260	1485780	recent news in the story.
1485780	1489740	I would wager a guess that now that the initial controversy has blown over, these guys felt
1489740	1491420	more comfortable talking to the press.
1491420	1496500	A major mobile game publisher and one of Unity's biggest clients met with John Risatello himself
1496500	1499140	after the first runtime fee policy was announced.
1499140	1501980	They directly told him, fuck you, we're not paying.
1501980	1507060	Unity planned to announce a 4% revenue share for games that earned over $1 million, slightly
1507060	1509340	undercutting Unreal Engine's 5%.
1509340	1514620	But the response was so fierce, it was knocked down to 2.5% in the second tweaked policy,
1514620	1516140	announced a week and a half later.
1516140	1520560	Before the original runtime fee announcement was made, a very large group of senior Unity
1520560	1523140	managers met to discuss the proposed changes.
1523140	1526340	Half of the people in that meeting said that the model was too complicated.
1526340	1529140	It wasn't going to be well-received and that they should talk to other people before they
1529140	1530140	do it.
1530140	1533380	Apparently, Unity had spoken to people, they didn't say who it was.
1533380	1535320	The whole thing felt very rushed.
1535320	1538300	They had a meeting and they were told that it was happening, but they weren't told to
1538300	1539300	date.
1539340	1543340	This actually sounds a lot like something that Mark Whitten said in that interview from
1543340	1544340	earlier.
1569300	1576020	feedback and we need to do better and I can tell you you know as an example on Sunday
1576020	1580860	I think it's been a long week so the days together a little bit but on Sunday I think
1580860	1587660	we put up on on X a kind of a statement saying that we'll get back to you in a couple of
1587660	1591080	days the reason we didn't get back to you in a couple of days is because we were as
1591080	1595820	we were working through the plan we were going back and talking to big customers independent
1595820	1600320	developers partners over and over again to get that feedback because I think the most
1600320	1607220	fundamental thing about talking to customers is it's it's kind of an ongoing iterative
1607220	1612780	conversation and we didn't do that well enough and you know now I'm very very convicted on
1612780	1617920	this policy that we're doing that the source also said that the company Apple oven is dominating
1617920	1622760	and unity tried to use this policy as a forcing agent to try and get back some market share
1622760	1627160	it was iron source and unity's play to increase their mediation business and developers have
1627160	1630840	been caught in the crossfire of this mediation war that's been going on for a couple of years
1630840	1635240	now here's the deep lore on that iron source has a competitor in the advertisements in
1635240	1640040	apps space called app lovin app lovin is a larger company without the reputation of spreading
1640040	1644520	malware around and when unity announced their desire to merge with iron source in 2022 app
1644520	1648640	lovin seeing their competitor merge with a major player decided to counter offer they
1648640	1654200	would buy unity instead and offered up 17 billion dollars for the deal unity ultimately rejected
1654200	1658880	them sticking with their iron source acquisition instead which cost them around 4.4 billion to
1658880	1663560	complete neil long reported previously on the app love and story back in september where multiple
1663560	1668400	game development studios using unity admitted that unity quietly offered to waive the runtime
1668400	1673400	fee if they switched away from app lovin and used their in-app advertisement tools instead
1673400	1678360	one developer specifically speculated that iron source has wanted to kill app lovin for a long
1678400	1683200	time and now unity as iron sources owner and with iron source executives on their board have
1683200	1687920	continued that goal app lovin has been dominating this specific market offering what developers
1687920	1692240	claim is a superior product to iron sources an iron sources game plan has been to integrate
1692240	1696480	themselves vertically to control access to other pieces of the market chain rather than develop
1696480	1700960	their own superior product the developers have also stated that this move has come from the iron
1700960	1706160	source side of the merged business not the unity side and that while large companies can simply
1706200	1711760	pay the fee small developers have no choice but to accept unity's in-app advertisement tools in
1711760	1716960	order to save their projects going back to the october article the anonymous sources inside unity
1716960	1721200	confirmed that neil long's reporting and the developer assertions from the september article
1721200	1725600	were actually accurate a second large mobile publisher who also refused to switch from
1725600	1729680	app lovin to iron source was told by the company that that was the last time you could have got
1729680	1733440	that money and that in the future presumably when the terms of service changed again they will be
1733440	1738640	forced to use iron source and that iron source's intention is to completely wipe app lovin out
1738640	1743120	nonetheless the source at unity doesn't believe this was done maliciously unity has lost a lot
1743120	1747680	of money over the last 18 years billions of dollars and they need to do something to make
1747680	1752480	money sadly this wasn't delivered well but the need to make more money is still there again this
1752480	1757360	is very similar to something witten said earlier why did you go about doing this whole thing the
1757360	1763120	the pricing plan change putting this up posting it out there making a lot of people angry of course
1763120	1768320	and then rolling it back a week later like what was the point of doing all that if you're gonna
1768320	1775120	kind of do this roll back afterwards well uh the most fundamental thing that we're trying to do is
1775120	1780080	we're building a sustainable business for unity and for us that means that we do need to have a
1780080	1786240	model that includes some sort of balanced exchange including shared success that's really really
1786240	1791520	important for the the long-term future of how we think about um our business how we think about the
1791520	1796480	engine and the main reason is really clear it has to be a sustainable business we want to keep
1796480	1800400	massively and deeply investing in the engine we want to make sure that we can build the best
1800960	1807040	editor and runtime for everyone to build the games today and tomorrow and that's the reason why we
1807040	1812320	work on it very very focused on that it's very important for unity according to like your
1812320	1818080	internal projections is this going to be enough to just keep things stable or do you feel like
1818160	1825040	you're going to need to re-evaluate in another year or two uh well listen you know when we make
1825040	1829920	a shift that says that it doesn't start until next year obviously that means that games that
1829920	1834560	are participating in the runtime are going to come later so like there's a shift on sort of where some
1834560	1839440	of that comes but this is about a business model transition this isn't about hey we need to do
1839440	1844000	something for the next three months or something like that this is about setting up the foundation
1844000	1847920	of the company this this program is critical for us for the foundation of the company
1847920	1852960	to be able to continue to invest for a very very long period of time so if the shape kind of is
1852960	1857280	like this you know like a little shape that goes like this versus being earlier that's less
1857280	1861280	relevant than making sure that we have a right program that works for our creators that's why
1861280	1865440	i believe that this is a better program because i think we got great feedback to make it a better
1865440	1869920	program and works for unity it's not just resatella who's decided to abandon the unity
1869920	1874000	sinking ship the source mentioned that many people have begun to apply elsewhere in the
1874000	1879440	games industry the writing's on the wall unity stock was at 200 in november of 2021
1879440	1884720	well before the iron source merger while it's now sitting at around 26 what makes this really funny
1884720	1889280	is that unity stock price has collapsed so much since this shit show began that applevan can
1889280	1892800	actually afford to just buy them outright again which they are currently considering
1892800	1896880	but it turns out despite whitman's remarks about the thresholds and whatever else in that interview
1896880	1900640	the people who will actually be affected by the changes at unity are the middle of the road
1900640	1905600	creators the unity source remarked that a lot of the outcry from indie devs was misplaced as none
1905600	1910080	of them will ever get anywhere near the 1 million dollar threshold anyway that rules out the indie
1910080	1915280	underclass meanwhile anyone in a bigger developer's business team or sales team is going to be able to
1915280	1920640	reduce those fees some big clients might leave other big clients might keep using unity and
1920640	1925200	simply pay a fee to avoid switching over to applevan that rules out the big names the only
1925200	1929440	ones who are going to start seeing serious money losses are the successful indies who are nonetheless
1929440	1932800	still a small companies like the hollow knights and the shovel knights and the undertales of the
1932800	1937760	world it's these people who will feel the pinch from unity so that brings us to the end is it
1937760	1943440	possible that unity was actually going okay not great but okay until deciding to buy iron source
1943440	1947920	a plague blanket of a company a deal which the executives were incentivized to take due to a
1947920	1951680	fat stack of cash provided to them by their investors which explains why they rejected
1951680	1956640	the applevan counteroffer a deal which left unity on the hook for a huge bill as well as ownership
1956640	1960400	of a bunch of tracking software that they had to somehow monetize leading them to pull this
1960400	1964960	retarded stunt on their own consumer base causing consumer confidence in their product to completely
1964960	1969200	vanish ending with the whole house of cards collapsing it's entirely possible but without
1969200	1973840	detailed information about the various mergers and acquisitions we can't be sure what we do know is
1973840	1979840	that individual on the ground game developers don't trust unity anymore publishers don't trust unity
1979840	1985600	anymore gamers don't trust unity anymore no one trusts unity anymore trust is hard to earn and
1985600	1991440	easy to lose and unity burned over a decade of trust in one swift stupid move many game developers
1991440	1995600	are pledging to move their games over from unity if possible others are saying that their next
1995600	2000720	titles won't use unity people are already beginning to make quick conversion tools for people moving
2000720	2005760	their stuff from unity to unreal or whatever people are asking if it's legal for unity to
2005760	2010000	simply unilaterally change the terms of service and they're finding out that as long as there's
2010000	2013920	enough time before changes are implemented and as long as customers re-sign the deal next time they
2013920	2018480	boot up the application companies that offer a service can change that service as they see fit
2018480	2023040	they're not bound to do the exact same thing in perpetuity just because you want them to
2023040	2027680	this next question is one i have been wondering and i don't know anything about and they were
2027680	2033040	wondering if it's legal to change the terms of service overnight and i don't know if it was
2033040	2037440	necessarily overnight but do you know i don't know anything about the legal side of this stuff
2037440	2042080	all i've heard is random speculation from people who are also not lawyers well i mean i mean i
2042080	2048160	think at sort of one level uh all companies change their terms over time you know frequently and
2048160	2052240	constantly and consistently you know because frankly the world changes gaming is a very
2052240	2056880	dynamic world the world we live in is dynamic and there are obviously always new things that are
2056880	2061280	that are being added or whatever however i want to back up from that and say you know it kind of
2061280	2067200	comes back to your trust point which is i think one thing that i heard a lot is people very very
2067200	2072000	deeply need to know what they're signing up for when they pick a version of unity to build their
2072000	2077200	game on and that they can you know be sure that they can continue to use that and i think that
2077200	2081600	feedback and there's a lot of other things that come along with trust so i just want to be clear
2081600	2086240	but that feedback is really really really super clear and that's one reason why you know what i
2086240	2090880	talked about today we're going to make sure that you can do that the problem with this all is that
2090880	2096560	it requires trust the very thing that unity has just torched customers need to trust that unity
2096560	2101760	is not darth vader altering the deal on a whim in some unfair way and that's out the window now
2101760	2105840	whitton did state in that interview that they haven't seen a significant drop in unity developers
2105840	2110160	like do you know that there's been a dip in users or is that something that you have to wait a
2110160	2117600	little while to see i mean i listen i see all of it on uh like any channel where we get feedback
2117600	2123520	obviously we see all the the feedback i haven't seen anything in our like actual numbers uh that
2123520	2128160	would show that not saying that that means it's not happening uh and i i will just say that it's
2128160	2133600	my job to make sure that we build the best product um so that um people don't want to do that and
2133600	2137680	that they want to stay on unity and build great games that might be true we probably won't know
2137680	2142960	until their next quarterly report despite all the backlash and all the pr spin from unity they
2142960	2147280	ultimately still aren't backing down i don't even necessarily begrudge them for wanting to make a
2147280	2150880	bit more money they're not exactly making tons of it right now though i do know where they probably
2150880	2157440	could pull a few bucks we rift or essentially reduce um some job categories for total about
2157440	2163280	250 and of course i i feel deeply about every individual so don't get me wrong the story for
2163280	2169120	one person is paid so i want to be clear about whenever there's job losses and most unity users
2169120	2174400	do actually pay them nothing for the use of their product but they bungled this so badly it might
2174400	2179840	actually mean the end of unity and that means i'm probably never getting hollow knight silks on
2179840	2184400	god damn it all right guys that about does it for me i know i'm late to the unity story we talked
2184400	2189520	about it on the archcast like a month ago for example but my laziness or my my prudence has
2189520	2193920	paid off if you want to hear more from me naomi and i recently recorded a vlog where we watched
2193920	2198800	the classic film they live in theaters click on the link on screen and i'll see you over there
2198800	2200640	have a good one guys i love you
