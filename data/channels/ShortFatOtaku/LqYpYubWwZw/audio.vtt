00:00.000 --> 00:16.760
Let's talk about Unity, because that's been a pretty fun rollercoaster recently.

00:16.760 --> 00:22.500
Back in 2005, three indie developers based out of Denmark founded the game studio Over

00:22.500 --> 00:27.160
the Edge Entertainment and put out their very first game, the arcade puzzler Goo Ball for

00:27.160 --> 00:28.160
Mac OS X.

00:28.760 --> 00:32.240
There's nothing really remarkable about it, it's just a Super Monkey Ball knockoff, but

00:32.240 --> 00:36.880
it was downloaded tons of times and it was one of the most popular games on the platform.

00:36.880 --> 00:41.400
However, this popularity didn't translate into commercial success for the company.

00:41.400 --> 00:45.320
Additionally, Over the Edge Entertainment had spent a significant amount of time building

00:45.320 --> 00:50.580
custom tools to make the game, since Mac OS X didn't really have anything for game development.

00:50.580 --> 00:54.740
Sensing a way to solve their financial problems, the company bundled its game dev tools into

00:54.740 --> 00:59.280
one application and sold it as the Unity game engine, the first modern game engine

00:59.280 --> 01:01.500
made specifically for Apple hardware.

01:01.500 --> 01:06.280
With the explosive success of the iPhone two years later, the Unity engine was perfectly

01:06.280 --> 01:10.420
poised to capitalize on the emerging market of smartphone games.

01:10.420 --> 01:14.640
Over the Edge Entertainment soon after changed their name to Unity Technologies.

01:14.640 --> 01:19.900
As Unity expanded beyond Apple's ecosystem, with versions for Android, consoles, and computers,

01:19.900 --> 01:24.440
it became the go-to choice for a lot of developers, especially if they lacked experience with

01:24.440 --> 01:25.580
game development.

01:25.580 --> 01:30.220
By 2012, over half of all mobile developers were using Unity to make their phone games,

01:30.220 --> 01:33.020
and Unity had hit 1 million registered users.

01:33.020 --> 01:36.900
By 2016, they had 5.5 million registered users.

01:36.900 --> 01:41.260
It basically became the next step up from the old RPG Maker applications of the early

01:41.260 --> 01:42.280
2000s.

01:42.280 --> 01:46.020
That was just a very simplistic game dev engine, and the only thing you could make with it

01:46.020 --> 01:49.120
were basically just Dragon Quest ripoffs.

01:49.120 --> 01:53.580
A lot of 90s kids who wanted to make games tinkered around with RPG Maker, including

01:53.580 --> 01:58.260
myself, I have a lot of old, deep RPG Maker lore still stuffed in my head.

01:58.260 --> 02:02.820
And many of those kids who did become indie devs in their 20s moved on to Unity for its

02:02.820 --> 02:04.380
similar ease of use.

02:04.380 --> 02:10.820
Unity's first big gangbuster title was Pokemon Go in 2016, after which the company's valuation

02:10.820 --> 02:11.860
skyrocketed.

02:11.860 --> 02:14.520
They went through several rounds of venture capital funding.

02:14.520 --> 02:18.640
They started putting out asset libraries and software development kits and VR software

02:18.640 --> 02:20.660
in order to further streamline game development.

02:20.740 --> 02:23.300
They've been making big deals with Facebook and Google.

02:23.300 --> 02:26.540
They've been buying out other companies like Vivox, a voice chat provider.

02:26.540 --> 02:30.620
They've been massively expanding their business with new employees and branches.

02:30.620 --> 02:35.340
And while it is paying off, Unity did post revenue of over half a billion dollars back

02:35.340 --> 02:36.520
in 2019.

02:36.520 --> 02:41.380
They have consistently operated at a loss every single year since their founding.

02:41.380 --> 02:46.100
In September of 2020, Unity Technologies went public, with an estimated market value of

02:46.100 --> 02:48.660
$13.7 billion.

02:48.660 --> 02:52.740
The company continued on its growth spree, buying up smaller companies left and right,

02:52.740 --> 02:58.100
expanding into markets everywhere between 2020 and 2022, leading us to the current 2023

02:58.100 --> 02:59.100
controversy.

02:59.100 --> 03:02.860
The story of Unity is one that seems pretty familiar to anybody who knows about the world

03:02.860 --> 03:03.860
of tech startups.

03:03.860 --> 03:08.640
A highly successful company offering an immensely popular product, but due to its own hubris

03:08.640 --> 03:13.900
and bloat, fails to achieve profitability, even as they grow and become a household name.

03:13.940 --> 03:19.080
On September 12th, 2023, Unity announced a change to their business model, adding new

03:19.080 --> 03:22.980
fees to their subscription plans, and the addition of a runtime fee.

03:22.980 --> 03:27.660
They clarified that it is indeed a price increase, but also that most Unity members won't be

03:27.660 --> 03:31.140
affected by it, as most Unity users don't pay anything at all.

03:31.140 --> 03:35.180
The only developers who will be affected are those who have successful games, and are generating

03:35.180 --> 03:38.800
revenues way above what Unity considers to be its threshold.

03:38.800 --> 03:43.020
The runtime fee install counter starts on January 1st, 2024.

03:43.020 --> 03:48.780
It is not retroactive, but they will charge the game developer once for every new install

03:48.780 --> 03:50.140
of a Unity game.

03:50.140 --> 03:54.560
Unity insists that they look for ways to not do this, but it seems like their perpetual

03:54.560 --> 03:57.500
financial troubles have finally forced their hand.

03:57.500 --> 03:58.780
Here's the threshold table.

03:58.780 --> 04:02.140
Basically, if you don't meet these thresholds, you won't be charged.

04:02.140 --> 04:08.340
For Unity Personal and Unity Plus, you need $200,000 in revenue and 200,000 installs.

04:08.340 --> 04:12.340
For Unity Pro and Enterprise, it's $1 million and 1 million installs.

04:12.340 --> 04:16.200
I don't know if they intend for this to be that you have to hit both thresholds or just

04:16.200 --> 04:17.620
one, it's ambiguous.

04:17.620 --> 04:21.340
Once you're over the threshold, though, Unity Personal and Unity Plus developers will be

04:21.340 --> 04:26.240
charged 20 cents for every install of their game, while Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise

04:26.240 --> 04:29.140
have a bunch of tiers for various install levels.

04:29.140 --> 04:33.620
Unity's confirmed that it's not every sale of a game, but every install of a game, meaning

04:33.620 --> 04:38.460
that hypothetically a customer could re-download the game on multiple computers, and the developer

04:38.460 --> 04:41.140
would be charged by Unity for every install.

04:41.140 --> 04:45.740
They literally made this 4chan meme real, where the company loses money for every install.

04:45.740 --> 04:48.860
Everybody realized that this was going to be a shitshow pretty much right away, and

04:48.860 --> 04:52.860
after a massive public backlash, Unity came out with a second statement.

04:52.860 --> 04:57.260
They clarified that demos will mostly not trigger a fee, developers won't be on the

04:57.260 --> 05:01.620
hook for game pass downloads, and that they're rolling back that whole install scheme, saying

05:01.620 --> 05:03.980
that only the first install will count.

05:03.980 --> 05:07.460
If that's the case, why not just make it a cut of revenue from sales, dude?

05:07.460 --> 05:10.860
One thing I will say, though, is that the public reaction to this whole mess got one

05:10.860 --> 05:12.580
critical thing wrong.

05:12.580 --> 05:16.540
Unity never said that the install fees would be retroactively applied, but everybody started

05:16.540 --> 05:17.980
acting like it would've.

05:17.980 --> 05:22.420
For example, this tweet went viral of an indie developer whose two games totaled 20 million

05:22.420 --> 05:26.220
in sales, and how he now apparently owes Unity over 5 million dollars.

05:26.220 --> 05:29.620
Yeah, that's pretty funny, and it's a pretty good way to hitch your brand to the latest

05:29.620 --> 05:34.420
outrage train, but if the install fee only actually starts in 2024, this guy's fine.

05:34.420 --> 05:38.940
However, Unity is potentially stepping on the toes of some very big players in the gaming

05:38.940 --> 05:40.380
industry by doing this.

05:40.380 --> 05:45.460
Genshin Impact uses Unity, Blizzard's Hearthstone uses Unity, Nintendo's Pokemon Diamond and

05:45.460 --> 05:47.300
Pearl remakes use Unity.

05:47.300 --> 05:52.180
If these companies start getting charged for every install of their games starting in 2024,

05:52.180 --> 05:54.540
you can bet there will be lawsuits.

05:54.540 --> 05:58.540
So let's actually examine that whole multiple installs thing in depth.

05:58.540 --> 06:01.340
Here is the pro-Unity interpretation of events.

06:01.340 --> 06:05.460
The general manager of Unity Create, which is a subdivision of Unity, Mark Whitten, was

06:05.460 --> 06:09.760
interviewed about the controversy by Jason Wyman, a game developer who uses Unity.

06:09.760 --> 06:13.960
One of the questions Whitten was asked was which group of their users would be the most

06:13.960 --> 06:16.180
affected by the new pricing changes.

06:16.180 --> 06:20.900
Before the way that Unity personal worked is you could use it up to $100,000 of revenue

06:20.900 --> 06:22.240
for your company.

06:22.240 --> 06:26.780
Now it's $200,000, so twice the size, so it's easier to use for more people, covers

06:26.780 --> 06:29.820
more cases, and it's more flexible.

06:29.820 --> 06:31.800
So that's number one.

06:31.800 --> 06:36.100
Not a part of the program, totally free, majority of our users, and a lot more flexibility.

06:36.100 --> 06:43.060
So the runtime fee applies for people who are over both a million dollars in sort of

06:43.060 --> 06:48.620
trailing 12 months revenue money they've made over the last year on kind of an ongoing basis,

06:48.620 --> 06:53.740
and a million engagements with new users, essentially.

06:53.740 --> 06:55.780
And for those users, they're following changes.

06:55.780 --> 07:03.100
The first one is this is with next year's LTS, which would be what is 2023 LTS, shipping

07:03.100 --> 07:04.240
in 2024.

07:04.240 --> 07:08.820
So it doesn't impact any games that have currently shipped, and it doesn't impact the games people

07:08.820 --> 07:12.760
may have already been working on for a very, very long period of time.

07:12.760 --> 07:16.700
One of the most, I think, really key pieces of feedback we heard is that it was a really

07:16.700 --> 07:21.460
big business model change that people didn't expect.

07:21.460 --> 07:26.020
And so it's very clear to us that having it start on a future version where everybody

07:26.020 --> 07:29.660
can make the choice to use it is really, really important.

07:29.660 --> 07:33.780
The second that we heard along with that is that people need to know that they can rely

07:33.780 --> 07:36.880
on a set of terms when they start using a version of Unity.

07:36.880 --> 07:40.020
So we're going to make sure that that's the case.

07:40.020 --> 07:45.620
There are even some pieces about that, things like the GitHub repo that, by the way, I will

07:45.620 --> 07:49.780
just say prior to last week, I did not know existed.

07:50.020 --> 07:53.900
Now I know a lot about, and we're making sure, I think it's already back up there, it has

07:53.900 --> 07:55.020
all of them in there.

07:55.020 --> 07:59.260
Obviously, our website will always have our legal terms and terms of service and all of

07:59.260 --> 08:03.140
those sorts of things, but we're going to make sure it's also on the GitHub so people

08:03.140 --> 08:04.220
can track that.

08:04.220 --> 08:09.880
And then the last that I would talk about is when you are using this future version

08:09.880 --> 08:15.360
of Unity, you have a game that's over the million dollars, million engagements, that

08:15.360 --> 08:24.220
there's a choice between either a 2.5% revenue share or measuring based on this calculated

08:24.220 --> 08:28.660
amount of initial user engagements that you can do.

08:28.660 --> 08:34.720
And if you do both of those, you'll always be billed the lesser of whatever that calculation

08:34.720 --> 08:35.720
is, but it's also up to you.

08:35.720 --> 08:39.260
If you only wanted to do one of them, leave the box blank, whatever.

08:39.260 --> 08:45.020
And again, that's only for those games that were over those thresholds.

08:45.680 --> 08:49.260
Sorry, one more minute, you asked me.

08:49.260 --> 08:51.640
And then the other key part on that one is it's self-reported.

08:51.640 --> 08:56.000
So it's both numbers being self-reported, both on the revenue side and on the user engagements.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.860
Yeah, I think that's a big one.

08:58.860 --> 09:02.480
I think there are a couple of questions about that that we'll get into, but I think the

09:02.480 --> 09:07.520
self-reporting and the mix up around there is a big one that I think people would be

09:07.520 --> 09:08.520
pretty happy with.

09:08.520 --> 09:11.080
If Witten's telling the truth, this sounds pretty good.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.680
The vast majority of users won't be affected at all.

09:13.680 --> 09:18.000
The next question was about how the multiple installs would be tracked, and Witten replied

09:18.000 --> 09:21.060
that basically the whole thing is going to be on the honor system.

09:21.060 --> 09:25.580
How will you track what version of Unity developers are using, or is that something you're even

09:25.580 --> 09:27.260
going to track?

09:27.260 --> 09:31.620
You know what version of Unity that you're using, and we're going to make sure that you're

09:31.620 --> 09:35.960
clear, like what terms are associated with that particular version.

09:35.960 --> 09:40.340
This is actually, frankly, the same as actually Unity Personal.

09:40.340 --> 09:46.760
When we say that you can use Unity Personal up to $200,000, we're also not tracking that.

09:46.760 --> 09:52.180
We're just telling you that this is what the rights are associated with this version so

09:52.180 --> 09:58.000
that you know, and then obviously if we find out that you're doing it, we have a conversation,

09:58.000 --> 09:59.400
but you know.

09:59.400 --> 10:04.480
Yeah, so there's not an extra tracking or anything added in, which I kind of assumed.

10:04.480 --> 10:09.320
I figured it would be just like the current setup where you use Unity Free, and then eventually

10:09.320 --> 10:13.700
you upgrade to Pro unless you don't like to follow the rules, and maybe if you get

10:13.700 --> 10:17.340
super huge or something, somebody at Unity might hit you up.

10:17.340 --> 10:21.960
Just to real quick clarify one more time for everybody, on the counting of those, that's

10:21.960 --> 10:26.060
just you're going in, now make sure I understand this right, I'm just going into like Steam

10:26.060 --> 10:31.700
and saying, hey, I sold this many, subtracting my refunds from that, and putting that in.

10:31.700 --> 10:32.700
Subtract refunds, exactly.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.700
Yeah.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.700
Okay, yeah.

10:34.700 --> 10:35.700
That's kind of what I expected.

10:35.700 --> 10:36.700
Yeah, those are my things.

10:36.700 --> 10:37.700
Yes.

10:37.700 --> 10:38.700
Okay.

10:39.080 --> 10:43.760
I've reported based on data that you easily have available, not sort of like I have to

10:43.760 --> 10:48.560
track some sort of user behavior that's different than I've ever done or anything like that.

10:48.560 --> 10:52.620
You don't have to go add in analytics or some tracking or anything, you just look at whatever

10:52.620 --> 10:55.220
your numbers are and then put those into the page.

10:55.220 --> 10:59.400
That's kind of been what I expected from the start, but it was definitely, I'll be honest,

10:59.400 --> 11:03.320
it was very unclear because it said there was a proprietary algorithm in there.

11:03.320 --> 11:08.520
I feel like those two words made the thing drastically more confusing and led to a lot

11:08.520 --> 11:09.520
of speculation.

11:09.520 --> 11:12.060
Even for me, I don't know what that means.

11:12.060 --> 11:13.620
Yeah, you're right.

11:13.620 --> 11:17.840
And we want to be super clear that self-reporting, and by the way, on both, both the revenue

11:17.840 --> 11:19.940
side and on that is really key.

11:19.940 --> 11:24.860
It's why this program is very important, but we're trying to make sure that this is easy

11:24.860 --> 11:27.380
for our game creators as well.

11:27.380 --> 11:28.380
Yeah.

11:28.380 --> 11:29.380
No, that's good.

11:29.380 --> 11:34.100
I mean, that seems like data that, at least I've always had, if you sell games and have

11:34.100 --> 11:37.700
people download them, you've got the info on how many are downloading it or how much

11:37.700 --> 11:39.080
money you're making each month.

11:39.080 --> 11:43.520
So, that seems relatively straightforward and a lot better than some built-in tracking

11:43.520 --> 11:46.320
spyware thing that I kept hearing about.

11:46.320 --> 11:47.320
Yeah.

11:47.320 --> 11:51.080
And again, I'm sorry that I had to use the corporate jargon, but the truth is there's

11:51.080 --> 11:53.160
just a lot of different scenarios in games.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.080
And so, some people might say, why isn't it sales?

11:56.080 --> 11:58.240
But sales doesn't work if it's a free-to-play game.

11:58.240 --> 12:03.300
And so, we're trying to make sure that we can clearly define that in a way that works

12:03.300 --> 12:06.580
for a bunch of different ways that Unity's used.

12:06.580 --> 12:08.640
This seems pretty above board too.

12:08.640 --> 12:13.020
Unity will require game developers to self-report their statistics on sales numbers and revenue

12:13.020 --> 12:17.200
and number of installs, all of which Steam's backend provides to the developer.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.760
Xbox's backend provides them.

12:18.760 --> 12:20.700
Most storefronts provide these numbers.

12:20.700 --> 12:24.880
This does mean there's a possibility that lying developers can inaccurately report their

12:24.880 --> 12:25.880
numbers.

12:25.880 --> 12:29.120
And Witten does say that if there's obvious huge discrepancies, like if a game with 10

12:29.120 --> 12:33.400
million players reports to Unity 10,000 sales, they reserve the right to approach the game

12:33.400 --> 12:34.620
developer about it.

12:34.640 --> 12:39.320
But for the most part, they intend to just roll with self-reporting on revenue and installs.

12:39.320 --> 12:44.360
Witten also clarified what was meant by an install and admits that Unity did a very bad

12:44.360 --> 12:46.560
job at explaining what they meant to do.

12:46.560 --> 12:47.560
That's an understatement.

13:04.620 --> 13:17.200
Yeah, and I'm going to sound a little corporatey here for a second while I use the words around

13:17.200 --> 13:20.720
it, but I'm just going to use them and then try to explain them a little bit.

13:20.720 --> 13:27.280
And that's, you know, the goal is as simple as saying that it's a legitimate user of your

13:27.280 --> 13:30.640
software on a particular distribution channel.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.640
So okay, what's a legitimate user?

13:32.660 --> 13:38.900
Well, a legitimate user would be an actual user, not your automated use, not whether

13:38.900 --> 13:44.060
there was piracy, not someone that had bought it and instantly refunded it, but like a legitimate

13:44.060 --> 13:49.340
first time that someone was engaging with your free-to-play game or your paid game.

13:49.340 --> 13:50.540
What's a distribution channel?

13:50.540 --> 13:52.980
Well, an app store is a distribution channel.

13:52.980 --> 14:00.500
So if that user went to a particular store and bought it or downloaded it or whatever,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.040
then you would start thinking of that as sort of doing it.

14:03.040 --> 14:08.520
Now if they had multiple devices or they reinstalled it, you don't count those multiple times.

14:08.520 --> 14:11.680
Because I might have gotten the same thing in my library from a store that I can use

14:11.680 --> 14:14.000
on a couple of different devices, great.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.720
That's one, not two.

14:15.720 --> 14:21.420
So there's a bunch more examples that are around that in the FAQ and we're very committed

14:21.420 --> 14:24.080
to making sure that we give more details around that.

14:24.080 --> 14:32.060
But our intent is very simple, which is that the first time that your game with our runtime

14:32.060 --> 14:37.340
engages with a very legitimate user on a distribution channel, use that as account.

14:37.340 --> 14:44.940
And then again, we think that many times that will be much less than this 2.5% revenue share.

14:44.940 --> 14:48.980
And so you could pay less or less through that, or you just go to the revenue share

14:48.980 --> 14:50.820
if you didn't want to track that.

14:50.820 --> 14:54.880
Whitten also went into detail on why they went with a fee for an install rather than

14:54.880 --> 14:56.360
a fee for a sale.

14:56.360 --> 15:00.160
Why was there a whole install thing in the beginning anyway?

15:00.160 --> 15:02.860
We think it's going to be cheaper for a lot of games.

15:02.860 --> 15:08.520
So listen, we're trying to build a model that we think is fair and is a good value exchange

15:08.520 --> 15:13.400
that works for games once they find a level of success.

15:13.400 --> 15:18.960
And we also want to tie it to this value that Unity brings, which is our runtime that's

15:18.960 --> 15:21.600
inside of the games themselves.

15:21.600 --> 15:24.980
And so it felt like a way where we could tie those two pieces together.

15:24.980 --> 15:31.940
And we think that in a pretty reasonable number of cases, that that's actually a smaller number.

15:31.940 --> 15:33.340
And we think that's good.

15:33.340 --> 15:37.820
Now what we heard, got a lot of really, really good feedback is that there were cases where

15:37.820 --> 15:41.160
people first off couldn't plan because they're like, well, I don't know, maybe something's

15:41.160 --> 15:45.840
going to go crazy or I have this particular scenario and that doesn't work.

15:45.840 --> 15:51.260
And so adding in the 2.5% revenue share as an option, you can only use that, or where

15:51.260 --> 15:52.260
you have the both.

15:52.260 --> 15:58.060
And so you can always plan for it and hopefully do better, definitely was, frankly, my opinion

15:58.060 --> 16:02.200
makes the plan better based on what we were trying to do.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.600
So it was really good feedback.

16:03.600 --> 16:10.140
Yeah, I was, to be honest, I said this in my streams earlier that the idea of being

16:10.140 --> 16:14.540
forced on a rev share doesn't sound appealing to me, but I've come from the background of

16:14.540 --> 16:20.540
MMOs and, you know, 50, $60 AAA games where a small install fee, we're looking at less

16:20.540 --> 16:22.320
than 1% or a 1% fee.

16:22.320 --> 16:28.000
So I like the option of both, but yeah, I haven't understood the argument of just force

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
a rev share.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.320
So hopefully that doesn't change and we stay with both options.

16:32.320 --> 16:34.040
I assume that's the plan.

16:34.040 --> 16:37.620
Oh, that's absolutely the plan or the plan is that choice.

16:37.620 --> 16:41.860
This actually sounds reasonable, like, yeah, free to play games would have no game sales

16:41.860 --> 16:42.860
they could cut off.

16:42.860 --> 16:47.300
Also people who just own a ton of random steam games from sales or humble bundles or something,

16:47.300 --> 16:50.360
but never actually play them, they won't trigger a fee either.

16:50.360 --> 16:53.220
By the way, I have a humble bundle affiliate link in the description, make sure to use

16:53.220 --> 16:54.400
it to buy your games.

16:54.400 --> 16:58.180
Basically, I know that it's Witten's job to put his company's best foot forward.

16:58.180 --> 17:02.500
He's obviously not impartial here, but he did offer an apology and some decent reasons

17:02.500 --> 17:05.440
as to why Unity decided to change their payment structure.

17:05.440 --> 17:09.840
But there is a second possible reason, one that isn't quite so above board.

17:09.840 --> 17:13.460
Remember when I mentioned that Unity was gobbling up companies left and right?

17:13.460 --> 17:18.180
Well, their expansion led them to buy out IronSource back in July of 2022.

17:18.180 --> 17:21.120
It's a bit tricky to figure out what IronSource actually does.

17:21.120 --> 17:24.440
Their Wikipedia page lists them as a mobile games company, but they don't seem to have

17:24.440 --> 17:25.720
put out any games.

17:25.720 --> 17:29.420
Their website says, one platform to turn your app into a business.

17:29.420 --> 17:33.940
Our platform lets you focus on what you do best, creating great apps and user experiences

17:33.940 --> 17:35.540
while we take care of the rest.

17:35.540 --> 17:40.120
Get the IronSource SDK to start monetizing your app and acquiring quality users.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.240
SDK just stands for Software Development Kit.

17:42.240 --> 17:44.800
Basically, it's a set of tools you can use to make a program.

17:44.800 --> 17:48.800
So alright, they sell tools that developers use to make games, just like Unity.

17:48.800 --> 17:53.480
IronSource used to sell their tools back in 2011 under the name InstallCore, and InstallCore

17:53.480 --> 17:55.240
has a sordid history.

17:55.240 --> 18:00.560
Various anti-virus and anti-malware applications began to label InstallCore as malware starting

18:00.560 --> 18:02.120
in 2014.

18:02.140 --> 18:05.820
InstallCore was an application that allowed those using it to include monetization in

18:05.820 --> 18:09.640
their programs through advertising, as well as making it possible to charge companies

18:09.640 --> 18:12.260
per installation through install tracking.

18:12.260 --> 18:16.020
It could also add toolbars to your internet browser that were difficult to remove, record

18:16.020 --> 18:20.140
your computer's processes, and send that data back home, and it was also the main reason

18:20.140 --> 18:23.420
that when you went to install a legitimate application, you often found that a whole

18:23.420 --> 18:26.260
bunch of other garbage got installed along with it.

18:26.260 --> 18:30.660
InstallCore became one of the most infamous bits of malware of the 2010s.

18:30.680 --> 18:34.960
InstallCore was phased out in 2020, having been replaced with the IronCore SDK, which

18:34.960 --> 18:36.620
is basically just more of the same.

18:36.620 --> 18:39.760
In fact, whenever you're on the Pirate Bay or some other torrent site or downloading

18:39.760 --> 18:43.760
site, and you see a banner ad claiming to lead you to a Google Chrome install but actually

18:43.760 --> 18:48.040
goes to some malware URL, that's generally IronCore's work.

18:48.040 --> 18:52.080
If you were to click on one of those obvious links, IronCore would install a toolbar into

18:52.080 --> 18:55.920
your browser that would display ads to you, track your internet usage, and lag the fuck

18:55.920 --> 18:57.200
out of your PC.

18:57.380 --> 19:00.960
Unity completed their buyout of IronSource in November of 2022.

19:00.960 --> 19:04.940
As part of the deal, IronSource's CEO joined the Unity board of directors.

19:04.940 --> 19:08.500
A few months later, the Unity board began the discussion of how to further monetize

19:08.500 --> 19:12.060
Unity and eventually came up with the idea of a per-install fee.

19:12.060 --> 19:16.060
It's not too much of a stretch to say that Unity, having just acquired a company that

19:16.060 --> 19:20.740
specialized in tracking malware, might put that software to use in the tracking of their

19:20.740 --> 19:21.740
users.

19:21.740 --> 19:26.420
Right now, everybody's claiming Unity's now ex-CEO, John Risatello, for this whole

19:26.420 --> 19:27.420
shit show.

19:27.420 --> 19:29.860
There's a pretty convincing story for that interpretation of events.

19:29.860 --> 19:34.020
Risatello was previously the CEO at EA, a gaming company that everyone's loved to

19:34.020 --> 19:36.620
hate for about, I don't know, 30 years now.

19:36.620 --> 19:40.980
He was brought into Unity back in 2014 and began to push for the company's aggressive

19:40.980 --> 19:41.980
expansion.

19:41.980 --> 19:45.900
During an interview, Risatello explained his logic behind Unity acquiring IronSource.

19:57.420 --> 20:03.120
We realized we shared a common vision, and with Unity, most of the world's game content

20:03.120 --> 20:05.220
is built on Unity.

20:05.220 --> 20:08.420
We've also got a really strong monetization network.

20:08.420 --> 20:12.980
And what we're trying to get to, you know, over the course of many years, is a platform

20:12.980 --> 20:18.060
where a creator can make the best content and monetize the best content.

20:18.060 --> 20:22.420
And sometimes monetization is harder than it is to build the great game.

20:22.420 --> 20:26.060
If you don't have a great business to go with a great game, you don't have a great

20:26.060 --> 20:29.340
game because you don't have the resources to make it.

20:29.340 --> 20:35.080
And so here, what this is about is they have some tools that are pretty amazing that if

20:35.080 --> 20:40.220
you add them to our stack, we can get to a place where a creator can get user feedback

20:40.220 --> 20:42.900
on pieces of the game along the way.

20:42.900 --> 20:48.660
So they know how the game or the digital twin or whatever the real-time 3D content is made

20:48.660 --> 20:49.660
to be.

20:50.660 --> 20:55.620
And they get feedback on user engagement and what's working, not working, and not working,

20:55.620 --> 21:00.460
and also simultaneously get feedback on what it takes to acquire a user.

21:00.460 --> 21:07.940
So the outgrowth of a unified creation and growth platform that we could put together

21:07.940 --> 21:13.860
is really better content and a better business in a way that we think is really magical for

21:13.860 --> 21:14.860
creators.

21:14.860 --> 21:18.560
While I'm sure there's certainly some very positive uses for IronSource's tracking tools,

21:18.560 --> 21:22.720
he does make a good case for them, it's also very easy to see how it's not all sunshine

21:22.720 --> 21:26.760
and rainbows, where Satello went into more detail on the data front, specifically saying

21:26.760 --> 21:28.120
more data is good.

21:48.560 --> 21:52.520
means we're not dependent on any one data source, and so they've got a lot of different

21:52.520 --> 21:54.560
data sources and so do we.

21:54.560 --> 21:57.880
It's a large number, I can list them if you want.

21:57.880 --> 22:02.520
The second is they've got a leading mediation tool, which is an important part of a full

22:02.520 --> 22:05.560
stack monetization platform.

22:05.560 --> 22:11.840
We will bring more data, more demand to that platform, and that's helpful to both companies.

22:11.840 --> 22:14.280
Again, customers win, we win.

22:14.280 --> 22:19.160
And third, they've got a set of publishing tools that they call SuperSonic.

22:19.160 --> 22:21.360
And it's a great solution for the long tail.

22:21.360 --> 22:24.960
Firstly, everybody in the long tail makes their games on Unity.

22:24.960 --> 22:30.120
This is one of those peanut butter and chocolate mixes where we've got the customer that they

22:30.120 --> 22:33.580
need, they've got the solution we need, and we see strong synergy in that.

22:33.580 --> 22:38.420
When Unity went public back in September of 2020, a few choice groups bought up a significant

22:38.420 --> 22:39.580
amount of their stock.

22:39.580 --> 22:43.280
A lot of people who follow stock ownership conspiracies will likely recognize some of

22:43.280 --> 22:44.280
these names.

22:44.280 --> 22:47.720
Sequoia Capital, Silver Lake Management, The Vanguard Group.

22:47.720 --> 22:52.560
Ironsource was even praised by the World Economic Forum as one of their preferred global growth

22:52.560 --> 22:53.560
companies.

22:53.560 --> 22:56.440
Okay, I'm not going to be diving into the Klaus Schwab rabbit hole today, I'm not prepared

22:56.440 --> 22:57.440
for it right now.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.000
And frankly, I don't think I believe a lot of it.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.560
I'm bringing this up because the CEO of a public company serves at the pleasure of the

23:02.560 --> 23:03.880
shareholder board.

23:03.880 --> 23:07.240
Even if Risatello disagreed with the Ironsource merger, and he probably didn't, he wasn't

23:07.240 --> 23:11.240
in a position to actually reject it, considering that Silver Lake and Sequoia announced an

23:11.240 --> 23:15.720
additional $1 billion of investment into the company if they took the deal.

23:15.720 --> 23:20.160
Risatello sold 2,000 Unity shares six days before the pricing announcement.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.640
He's been selling shares of Unity all year.

23:22.640 --> 23:25.040
Other executives at Unity have been doing the same.

23:25.040 --> 23:28.880
I think people at Unity have a feeling that things are starting to go belly up, despite

23:28.880 --> 23:30.440
their public statements otherwise.

23:30.440 --> 23:34.420
And now that Unity's had a spectacular PR blowout, Risatello has probably decided that

23:34.420 --> 23:36.680
now is the time for him to step down.

23:36.680 --> 23:39.960
What's likely is that he saw the writing on the wall, cashed out, and abandoned the sinking

23:39.960 --> 23:40.960
ship.

23:40.960 --> 23:44.160
He may have been the accidental orchestrator of this disaster, and decided to cut his losses

23:44.160 --> 23:45.160
and leave.

23:45.160 --> 23:48.320
He might have objected to the merger and been overruled by the owners of Unity, and now

23:48.320 --> 23:50.560
he's taken off before things really go tits up.

23:50.560 --> 23:54.400
Either way, he's gone, and the internet has certainly decided to blame him for everything.

23:54.400 --> 23:59.040
By the way, I personally believe that the Ironsource malware tracking story is probably

23:59.040 --> 24:03.200
more likely than the Mark Ritten, everything is totally cool story, because Unity announced

24:03.200 --> 24:08.000
that it will quietly waive all of those fees if game developers switch to their in-game

24:08.000 --> 24:09.820
ad monetization service.

24:09.820 --> 24:12.820
Another bit of software that came along with the Ironsource acquisition.

24:12.820 --> 24:18.180
Oh, also because of that $1 billion invested from Sequoia and Silver Lake to make that

24:18.180 --> 24:23.100
Ironsource deal go down smoothly, a chunk of it probably went towards executive compensation

24:23.100 --> 24:24.100
packages.

24:24.100 --> 24:29.100
$45 million over three years for Risatello, and $47 million over two years to Ritten,

24:29.100 --> 24:30.620
not to mention the other executives.

24:30.620 --> 24:35.220
Neil Long, reporting for the website Mobile Gamer, was contacted by sources within Unity

24:35.220 --> 24:36.500
about the whole fiasco.

24:36.500 --> 24:39.540
They are anonymous sources, presumably because they don't want to lose their jobs, so take

24:39.580 --> 24:40.740
this with a grain of salt.

24:40.740 --> 24:44.260
This was published only a few days ago on October 23rd, and it seems to be the most

24:44.260 --> 24:45.780
recent news in the story.

24:45.780 --> 24:49.740
I would wager a guess that now that the initial controversy has blown over, these guys felt

24:49.740 --> 24:51.420
more comfortable talking to the press.

24:51.420 --> 24:56.500
A major mobile game publisher and one of Unity's biggest clients met with John Risatello himself

24:56.500 --> 24:59.140
after the first runtime fee policy was announced.

24:59.140 --> 25:01.980
They directly told him, fuck you, we're not paying.

25:01.980 --> 25:07.060
Unity planned to announce a 4% revenue share for games that earned over $1 million, slightly

25:07.060 --> 25:09.340
undercutting Unreal Engine's 5%.

25:09.340 --> 25:14.620
But the response was so fierce, it was knocked down to 2.5% in the second tweaked policy,

25:14.620 --> 25:16.140
announced a week and a half later.

25:16.140 --> 25:20.560
Before the original runtime fee announcement was made, a very large group of senior Unity

25:20.560 --> 25:23.140
managers met to discuss the proposed changes.

25:23.140 --> 25:26.340
Half of the people in that meeting said that the model was too complicated.

25:26.340 --> 25:29.140
It wasn't going to be well-received and that they should talk to other people before they

25:29.140 --> 25:30.140
do it.

25:30.140 --> 25:33.380
Apparently, Unity had spoken to people, they didn't say who it was.

25:33.380 --> 25:35.320
The whole thing felt very rushed.

25:35.320 --> 25:38.300
They had a meeting and they were told that it was happening, but they weren't told to

25:38.300 --> 25:39.300
date.

25:39.340 --> 25:43.340
This actually sounds a lot like something that Mark Whitten said in that interview from

25:43.340 --> 25:44.340
earlier.

26:09.300 --> 26:16.020
feedback and we need to do better and I can tell you you know as an example on Sunday

26:16.020 --> 26:20.860
I think it's been a long week so the days together a little bit but on Sunday I think

26:20.860 --> 26:27.660
we put up on on X a kind of a statement saying that we'll get back to you in a couple of

26:27.660 --> 26:31.080
days the reason we didn't get back to you in a couple of days is because we were as

26:31.080 --> 26:35.820
we were working through the plan we were going back and talking to big customers independent

26:35.820 --> 26:40.320
developers partners over and over again to get that feedback because I think the most

26:40.320 --> 26:47.220
fundamental thing about talking to customers is it's it's kind of an ongoing iterative

26:47.220 --> 26:52.780
conversation and we didn't do that well enough and you know now I'm very very convicted on

26:52.780 --> 26:57.920
this policy that we're doing that the source also said that the company Apple oven is dominating

26:57.920 --> 27:02.760
and unity tried to use this policy as a forcing agent to try and get back some market share

27:02.760 --> 27:07.160
it was iron source and unity's play to increase their mediation business and developers have

27:07.160 --> 27:10.840
been caught in the crossfire of this mediation war that's been going on for a couple of years

27:10.840 --> 27:15.240
now here's the deep lore on that iron source has a competitor in the advertisements in

27:15.240 --> 27:20.040
apps space called app lovin app lovin is a larger company without the reputation of spreading

27:20.040 --> 27:24.520
malware around and when unity announced their desire to merge with iron source in 2022 app

27:24.520 --> 27:28.640
lovin seeing their competitor merge with a major player decided to counter offer they

27:28.640 --> 27:34.200
would buy unity instead and offered up 17 billion dollars for the deal unity ultimately rejected

27:34.200 --> 27:38.880
them sticking with their iron source acquisition instead which cost them around 4.4 billion to

27:38.880 --> 27:43.560
complete neil long reported previously on the app love and story back in september where multiple

27:43.560 --> 27:48.400
game development studios using unity admitted that unity quietly offered to waive the runtime

27:48.400 --> 27:53.400
fee if they switched away from app lovin and used their in-app advertisement tools instead

27:53.400 --> 27:58.360
one developer specifically speculated that iron source has wanted to kill app lovin for a long

27:58.400 --> 28:03.200
time and now unity as iron sources owner and with iron source executives on their board have

28:03.200 --> 28:07.920
continued that goal app lovin has been dominating this specific market offering what developers

28:07.920 --> 28:12.240
claim is a superior product to iron sources an iron sources game plan has been to integrate

28:12.240 --> 28:16.480
themselves vertically to control access to other pieces of the market chain rather than develop

28:16.480 --> 28:20.960
their own superior product the developers have also stated that this move has come from the iron

28:20.960 --> 28:26.160
source side of the merged business not the unity side and that while large companies can simply

28:26.200 --> 28:31.760
pay the fee small developers have no choice but to accept unity's in-app advertisement tools in

28:31.760 --> 28:36.960
order to save their projects going back to the october article the anonymous sources inside unity

28:36.960 --> 28:41.200
confirmed that neil long's reporting and the developer assertions from the september article

28:41.200 --> 28:45.600
were actually accurate a second large mobile publisher who also refused to switch from

28:45.600 --> 28:49.680
app lovin to iron source was told by the company that that was the last time you could have got

28:49.680 --> 28:53.440
that money and that in the future presumably when the terms of service changed again they will be

28:53.440 --> 28:58.640
forced to use iron source and that iron source's intention is to completely wipe app lovin out

28:58.640 --> 29:03.120
nonetheless the source at unity doesn't believe this was done maliciously unity has lost a lot

29:03.120 --> 29:07.680
of money over the last 18 years billions of dollars and they need to do something to make

29:07.680 --> 29:12.480
money sadly this wasn't delivered well but the need to make more money is still there again this

29:12.480 --> 29:17.360
is very similar to something witten said earlier why did you go about doing this whole thing the

29:17.360 --> 29:23.120
the pricing plan change putting this up posting it out there making a lot of people angry of course

29:23.120 --> 29:28.320
and then rolling it back a week later like what was the point of doing all that if you're gonna

29:28.320 --> 29:35.120
kind of do this roll back afterwards well uh the most fundamental thing that we're trying to do is

29:35.120 --> 29:40.080
we're building a sustainable business for unity and for us that means that we do need to have a

29:40.080 --> 29:46.240
model that includes some sort of balanced exchange including shared success that's really really

29:46.240 --> 29:51.520
important for the the long-term future of how we think about um our business how we think about the

29:51.520 --> 29:56.480
engine and the main reason is really clear it has to be a sustainable business we want to keep

29:56.480 --> 30:00.400
massively and deeply investing in the engine we want to make sure that we can build the best

30:00.960 --> 30:07.040
editor and runtime for everyone to build the games today and tomorrow and that's the reason why we

30:07.040 --> 30:12.320
work on it very very focused on that it's very important for unity according to like your

30:12.320 --> 30:18.080
internal projections is this going to be enough to just keep things stable or do you feel like

30:18.160 --> 30:25.040
you're going to need to re-evaluate in another year or two uh well listen you know when we make

30:25.040 --> 30:29.920
a shift that says that it doesn't start until next year obviously that means that games that

30:29.920 --> 30:34.560
are participating in the runtime are going to come later so like there's a shift on sort of where some

30:34.560 --> 30:39.440
of that comes but this is about a business model transition this isn't about hey we need to do

30:39.440 --> 30:44.000
something for the next three months or something like that this is about setting up the foundation

30:44.000 --> 30:47.920
of the company this this program is critical for us for the foundation of the company

30:47.920 --> 30:52.960
to be able to continue to invest for a very very long period of time so if the shape kind of is

30:52.960 --> 30:57.280
like this you know like a little shape that goes like this versus being earlier that's less

30:57.280 --> 31:01.280
relevant than making sure that we have a right program that works for our creators that's why

31:01.280 --> 31:05.440
i believe that this is a better program because i think we got great feedback to make it a better

31:05.440 --> 31:09.920
program and works for unity it's not just resatella who's decided to abandon the unity

31:09.920 --> 31:14.000
sinking ship the source mentioned that many people have begun to apply elsewhere in the

31:14.000 --> 31:19.440
games industry the writing's on the wall unity stock was at 200 in november of 2021

31:19.440 --> 31:24.720
well before the iron source merger while it's now sitting at around 26 what makes this really funny

31:24.720 --> 31:29.280
is that unity stock price has collapsed so much since this shit show began that applevan can

31:29.280 --> 31:32.800
actually afford to just buy them outright again which they are currently considering

31:32.800 --> 31:36.880
but it turns out despite whitman's remarks about the thresholds and whatever else in that interview

31:36.880 --> 31:40.640
the people who will actually be affected by the changes at unity are the middle of the road

31:40.640 --> 31:45.600
creators the unity source remarked that a lot of the outcry from indie devs was misplaced as none

31:45.600 --> 31:50.080
of them will ever get anywhere near the 1 million dollar threshold anyway that rules out the indie

31:50.080 --> 31:55.280
underclass meanwhile anyone in a bigger developer's business team or sales team is going to be able to

31:55.280 --> 32:00.640
reduce those fees some big clients might leave other big clients might keep using unity and

32:00.640 --> 32:05.200
simply pay a fee to avoid switching over to applevan that rules out the big names the only

32:05.200 --> 32:09.440
ones who are going to start seeing serious money losses are the successful indies who are nonetheless

32:09.440 --> 32:12.800
still a small companies like the hollow knights and the shovel knights and the undertales of the

32:12.800 --> 32:17.760
world it's these people who will feel the pinch from unity so that brings us to the end is it

32:17.760 --> 32:23.440
possible that unity was actually going okay not great but okay until deciding to buy iron source

32:23.440 --> 32:27.920
a plague blanket of a company a deal which the executives were incentivized to take due to a

32:27.920 --> 32:31.680
fat stack of cash provided to them by their investors which explains why they rejected

32:31.680 --> 32:36.640
the applevan counteroffer a deal which left unity on the hook for a huge bill as well as ownership

32:36.640 --> 32:40.400
of a bunch of tracking software that they had to somehow monetize leading them to pull this

32:40.400 --> 32:44.960
retarded stunt on their own consumer base causing consumer confidence in their product to completely

32:44.960 --> 32:49.200
vanish ending with the whole house of cards collapsing it's entirely possible but without

32:49.200 --> 32:53.840
detailed information about the various mergers and acquisitions we can't be sure what we do know is

32:53.840 --> 32:59.840
that individual on the ground game developers don't trust unity anymore publishers don't trust unity

32:59.840 --> 33:05.600
anymore gamers don't trust unity anymore no one trusts unity anymore trust is hard to earn and

33:05.600 --> 33:11.440
easy to lose and unity burned over a decade of trust in one swift stupid move many game developers

33:11.440 --> 33:15.600
are pledging to move their games over from unity if possible others are saying that their next

33:15.600 --> 33:20.720
titles won't use unity people are already beginning to make quick conversion tools for people moving

33:20.720 --> 33:25.760
their stuff from unity to unreal or whatever people are asking if it's legal for unity to

33:25.760 --> 33:30.000
simply unilaterally change the terms of service and they're finding out that as long as there's

33:30.000 --> 33:33.920
enough time before changes are implemented and as long as customers re-sign the deal next time they

33:33.920 --> 33:38.480
boot up the application companies that offer a service can change that service as they see fit

33:38.480 --> 33:43.040
they're not bound to do the exact same thing in perpetuity just because you want them to

33:43.040 --> 33:47.680
this next question is one i have been wondering and i don't know anything about and they were

33:47.680 --> 33:53.040
wondering if it's legal to change the terms of service overnight and i don't know if it was

33:53.040 --> 33:57.440
necessarily overnight but do you know i don't know anything about the legal side of this stuff

33:57.440 --> 34:02.080
all i've heard is random speculation from people who are also not lawyers well i mean i mean i

34:02.080 --> 34:08.160
think at sort of one level uh all companies change their terms over time you know frequently and

34:08.160 --> 34:12.240
constantly and consistently you know because frankly the world changes gaming is a very

34:12.240 --> 34:16.880
dynamic world the world we live in is dynamic and there are obviously always new things that are

34:16.880 --> 34:21.280
that are being added or whatever however i want to back up from that and say you know it kind of

34:21.280 --> 34:27.200
comes back to your trust point which is i think one thing that i heard a lot is people very very

34:27.200 --> 34:32.000
deeply need to know what they're signing up for when they pick a version of unity to build their

34:32.000 --> 34:37.200
game on and that they can you know be sure that they can continue to use that and i think that

34:37.200 --> 34:41.600
feedback and there's a lot of other things that come along with trust so i just want to be clear

34:41.600 --> 34:46.240
but that feedback is really really really super clear and that's one reason why you know what i

34:46.240 --> 34:50.880
talked about today we're going to make sure that you can do that the problem with this all is that

34:50.880 --> 34:56.560
it requires trust the very thing that unity has just torched customers need to trust that unity

34:56.560 --> 35:01.760
is not darth vader altering the deal on a whim in some unfair way and that's out the window now

35:01.760 --> 35:05.840
whitton did state in that interview that they haven't seen a significant drop in unity developers

35:05.840 --> 35:10.160
like do you know that there's been a dip in users or is that something that you have to wait a

35:10.160 --> 35:17.600
little while to see i mean i listen i see all of it on uh like any channel where we get feedback

35:17.600 --> 35:23.520
obviously we see all the the feedback i haven't seen anything in our like actual numbers uh that

35:23.520 --> 35:28.160
would show that not saying that that means it's not happening uh and i i will just say that it's

35:28.160 --> 35:33.600
my job to make sure that we build the best product um so that um people don't want to do that and

35:33.600 --> 35:37.680
that they want to stay on unity and build great games that might be true we probably won't know

35:37.680 --> 35:42.960
until their next quarterly report despite all the backlash and all the pr spin from unity they

35:42.960 --> 35:47.280
ultimately still aren't backing down i don't even necessarily begrudge them for wanting to make a

35:47.280 --> 35:50.880
bit more money they're not exactly making tons of it right now though i do know where they probably

35:50.880 --> 35:57.440
could pull a few bucks we rift or essentially reduce um some job categories for total about

35:57.440 --> 36:03.280
250 and of course i i feel deeply about every individual so don't get me wrong the story for

36:03.280 --> 36:09.120
one person is paid so i want to be clear about whenever there's job losses and most unity users

36:09.120 --> 36:14.400
do actually pay them nothing for the use of their product but they bungled this so badly it might

36:14.400 --> 36:19.840
actually mean the end of unity and that means i'm probably never getting hollow knight silks on

36:19.840 --> 36:24.400
god damn it all right guys that about does it for me i know i'm late to the unity story we talked

36:24.400 --> 36:29.520
about it on the archcast like a month ago for example but my laziness or my my prudence has

36:29.520 --> 36:33.920
paid off if you want to hear more from me naomi and i recently recorded a vlog where we watched

36:33.920 --> 36:38.800
the classic film they live in theaters click on the link on screen and i'll see you over there

36:38.800 --> 36:40.640
have a good one guys i love you
