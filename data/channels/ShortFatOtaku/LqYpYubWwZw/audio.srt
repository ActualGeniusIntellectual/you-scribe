1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,760
Let's talk about Unity, because that's been a pretty fun rollercoaster recently.

2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,500
Back in 2005, three indie developers based out of Denmark founded the game studio Over

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,160
the Edge Entertainment and put out their very first game, the arcade puzzler Goo Ball for

4
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,160
Mac OS X.

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,240
There's nothing really remarkable about it, it's just a Super Monkey Ball knockoff, but

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,880
it was downloaded tons of times and it was one of the most popular games on the platform.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,400
However, this popularity didn't translate into commercial success for the company.

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,320
Additionally, Over the Edge Entertainment had spent a significant amount of time building

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,580
custom tools to make the game, since Mac OS X didn't really have anything for game development.

10
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,740
Sensing a way to solve their financial problems, the company bundled its game dev tools into

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,280
one application and sold it as the Unity game engine, the first modern game engine

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,500
made specifically for Apple hardware.

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,280
With the explosive success of the iPhone two years later, the Unity engine was perfectly

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,420
poised to capitalize on the emerging market of smartphone games.

15
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,640
Over the Edge Entertainment soon after changed their name to Unity Technologies.

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,900
As Unity expanded beyond Apple's ecosystem, with versions for Android, consoles, and computers,

17
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,440
it became the go-to choice for a lot of developers, especially if they lacked experience with

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,580
game development.

19
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,220
By 2012, over half of all mobile developers were using Unity to make their phone games,

20
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,020
and Unity had hit 1 million registered users.

21
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,900
By 2016, they had 5.5 million registered users.

22
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,260
It basically became the next step up from the old RPG Maker applications of the early

23
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,280
2000s.

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,020
That was just a very simplistic game dev engine, and the only thing you could make with it

25
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,120
were basically just Dragon Quest ripoffs.

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,580
A lot of 90s kids who wanted to make games tinkered around with RPG Maker, including

27
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,260
myself, I have a lot of old, deep RPG Maker lore still stuffed in my head.

28
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,820
And many of those kids who did become indie devs in their 20s moved on to Unity for its

29
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,380
similar ease of use.

30
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,820
Unity's first big gangbuster title was Pokemon Go in 2016, after which the company's valuation

31
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,860
skyrocketed.

32
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,520
They went through several rounds of venture capital funding.

33
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,640
They started putting out asset libraries and software development kits and VR software

34
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,660
in order to further streamline game development.

35
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,300
They've been making big deals with Facebook and Google.

36
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,540
They've been buying out other companies like Vivox, a voice chat provider.

37
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,620
They've been massively expanding their business with new employees and branches.

38
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,340
And while it is paying off, Unity did post revenue of over half a billion dollars back

39
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,520
in 2019.

40
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,380
They have consistently operated at a loss every single year since their founding.

41
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,100
In September of 2020, Unity Technologies went public, with an estimated market value of

42
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,660
$13.7 billion.

43
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,740
The company continued on its growth spree, buying up smaller companies left and right,

44
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,100
expanding into markets everywhere between 2020 and 2022, leading us to the current 2023

45
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,100
controversy.

46
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,860
The story of Unity is one that seems pretty familiar to anybody who knows about the world

47
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,860
of tech startups.

48
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,640
A highly successful company offering an immensely popular product, but due to its own hubris

49
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,900
and bloat, fails to achieve profitability, even as they grow and become a household name.

50
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:19,080
On September 12th, 2023, Unity announced a change to their business model, adding new

51
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,980
fees to their subscription plans, and the addition of a runtime fee.

52
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,660
They clarified that it is indeed a price increase, but also that most Unity members won't be

53
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,140
affected by it, as most Unity users don't pay anything at all.

54
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,180
The only developers who will be affected are those who have successful games, and are generating

55
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,800
revenues way above what Unity considers to be its threshold.

56
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,020
The runtime fee install counter starts on January 1st, 2024.

57
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,780
It is not retroactive, but they will charge the game developer once for every new install

58
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,140
of a Unity game.

59
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,560
Unity insists that they look for ways to not do this, but it seems like their perpetual

60
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,500
financial troubles have finally forced their hand.

61
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,780
Here's the threshold table.

62
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,140
Basically, if you don't meet these thresholds, you won't be charged.

63
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:08,340
For Unity Personal and Unity Plus, you need $200,000 in revenue and 200,000 installs.

64
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,340
For Unity Pro and Enterprise, it's $1 million and 1 million installs.

65
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,200
I don't know if they intend for this to be that you have to hit both thresholds or just

66
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,620
one, it's ambiguous.

67
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,340
Once you're over the threshold, though, Unity Personal and Unity Plus developers will be

68
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,240
charged 20 cents for every install of their game, while Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise

69
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,140
have a bunch of tiers for various install levels.

70
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,620
Unity's confirmed that it's not every sale of a game, but every install of a game, meaning

71
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,460
that hypothetically a customer could re-download the game on multiple computers, and the developer

72
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,140
would be charged by Unity for every install.

73
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,740
They literally made this 4chan meme real, where the company loses money for every install.

74
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,860
Everybody realized that this was going to be a shitshow pretty much right away, and

75
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,860
after a massive public backlash, Unity came out with a second statement.

76
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,260
They clarified that demos will mostly not trigger a fee, developers won't be on the

77
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,620
hook for game pass downloads, and that they're rolling back that whole install scheme, saying

78
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,980
that only the first install will count.

79
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,460
If that's the case, why not just make it a cut of revenue from sales, dude?

80
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,860
One thing I will say, though, is that the public reaction to this whole mess got one

81
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,580
critical thing wrong.

82
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,540
Unity never said that the install fees would be retroactively applied, but everybody started

83
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,980
acting like it would've.

84
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,420
For example, this tweet went viral of an indie developer whose two games totaled 20 million

85
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,220
in sales, and how he now apparently owes Unity over 5 million dollars.

86
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,620
Yeah, that's pretty funny, and it's a pretty good way to hitch your brand to the latest

87
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,420
outrage train, but if the install fee only actually starts in 2024, this guy's fine.

88
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,940
However, Unity is potentially stepping on the toes of some very big players in the gaming

89
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,380
industry by doing this.

90
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:45,460
Genshin Impact uses Unity, Blizzard's Hearthstone uses Unity, Nintendo's Pokemon Diamond and

91
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,300
Pearl remakes use Unity.

92
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,180
If these companies start getting charged for every install of their games starting in 2024,

93
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,540
you can bet there will be lawsuits.

94
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,540
So let's actually examine that whole multiple installs thing in depth.

95
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,340
Here is the pro-Unity interpretation of events.

96
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,460
The general manager of Unity Create, which is a subdivision of Unity, Mark Whitten, was

97
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,760
interviewed about the controversy by Jason Wyman, a game developer who uses Unity.

98
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,960
One of the questions Whitten was asked was which group of their users would be the most

99
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,180
affected by the new pricing changes.

100
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,900
Before the way that Unity personal worked is you could use it up to $100,000 of revenue

101
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,240
for your company.

102
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,780
Now it's $200,000, so twice the size, so it's easier to use for more people, covers

103
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,820
more cases, and it's more flexible.

104
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,800
So that's number one.

105
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,100
Not a part of the program, totally free, majority of our users, and a lot more flexibility.

106
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:43,060
So the runtime fee applies for people who are over both a million dollars in sort of

107
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,620
trailing 12 months revenue money they've made over the last year on kind of an ongoing basis,

108
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,740
and a million engagements with new users, essentially.

109
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,780
And for those users, they're following changes.

110
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:03,100
The first one is this is with next year's LTS, which would be what is 2023 LTS, shipping

111
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,240
in 2024.

112
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,820
So it doesn't impact any games that have currently shipped, and it doesn't impact the games people

113
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,760
may have already been working on for a very, very long period of time.

114
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,700
One of the most, I think, really key pieces of feedback we heard is that it was a really

115
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,460
big business model change that people didn't expect.

116
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:26,020
And so it's very clear to us that having it start on a future version where everybody

117
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,660
can make the choice to use it is really, really important.

118
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,780
The second that we heard along with that is that people need to know that they can rely

119
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,880
on a set of terms when they start using a version of Unity.

120
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,020
So we're going to make sure that that's the case.

121
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,620
There are even some pieces about that, things like the GitHub repo that, by the way, I will

122
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,780
just say prior to last week, I did not know existed.

123
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,900
Now I know a lot about, and we're making sure, I think it's already back up there, it has

124
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,020
all of them in there.

125
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,260
Obviously, our website will always have our legal terms and terms of service and all of

126
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,140
those sorts of things, but we're going to make sure it's also on the GitHub so people

127
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,220
can track that.

128
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,880
And then the last that I would talk about is when you are using this future version

129
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:15,360
of Unity, you have a game that's over the million dollars, million engagements, that

130
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:24,220
there's a choice between either a 2.5% revenue share or measuring based on this calculated

131
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,660
amount of initial user engagements that you can do.

132
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:34,720
And if you do both of those, you'll always be billed the lesser of whatever that calculation

133
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,720
is, but it's also up to you.

134
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,260
If you only wanted to do one of them, leave the box blank, whatever.

135
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:45,020
And again, that's only for those games that were over those thresholds.

136
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,260
Sorry, one more minute, you asked me.

137
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,640
And then the other key part on that one is it's self-reported.

138
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,000
So it's both numbers being self-reported, both on the revenue side and on the user engagements.

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,860
Yeah, I think that's a big one.

140
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,480
I think there are a couple of questions about that that we'll get into, but I think the

141
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,520
self-reporting and the mix up around there is a big one that I think people would be

142
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,520
pretty happy with.

143
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,080
If Witten's telling the truth, this sounds pretty good.

144
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,680
The vast majority of users won't be affected at all.

145
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,000
The next question was about how the multiple installs would be tracked, and Witten replied

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,060
that basically the whole thing is going to be on the honor system.

147
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,580
How will you track what version of Unity developers are using, or is that something you're even

148
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,260
going to track?

149
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,620
You know what version of Unity that you're using, and we're going to make sure that you're

150
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,960
clear, like what terms are associated with that particular version.

151
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,340
This is actually, frankly, the same as actually Unity Personal.

152
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:46,760
When we say that you can use Unity Personal up to $200,000, we're also not tracking that.

153
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,180
We're just telling you that this is what the rights are associated with this version so

154
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:58,000
that you know, and then obviously if we find out that you're doing it, we have a conversation,

155
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,400
but you know.

156
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,480
Yeah, so there's not an extra tracking or anything added in, which I kind of assumed.

157
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,320
I figured it would be just like the current setup where you use Unity Free, and then eventually

158
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,700
you upgrade to Pro unless you don't like to follow the rules, and maybe if you get

159
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,340
super huge or something, somebody at Unity might hit you up.

160
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:21,960
Just to real quick clarify one more time for everybody, on the counting of those, that's

161
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,060
just you're going in, now make sure I understand this right, I'm just going into like Steam

162
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:31,700
and saying, hey, I sold this many, subtracting my refunds from that, and putting that in.

163
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,700
Subtract refunds, exactly.

164
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,700
Yeah.

165
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,700
Okay, yeah.

166
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,700
That's kind of what I expected.

167
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,700
Yeah, those are my things.

168
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Yes.

169
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,700
Okay.

170
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,760
I've reported based on data that you easily have available, not sort of like I have to

171
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,560
track some sort of user behavior that's different than I've ever done or anything like that.

172
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,620
You don't have to go add in analytics or some tracking or anything, you just look at whatever

173
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,220
your numbers are and then put those into the page.

174
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,400
That's kind of been what I expected from the start, but it was definitely, I'll be honest,

175
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,320
it was very unclear because it said there was a proprietary algorithm in there.

176
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,520
I feel like those two words made the thing drastically more confusing and led to a lot

177
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
of speculation.

178
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,060
Even for me, I don't know what that means.

179
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,620
Yeah, you're right.

180
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,840
And we want to be super clear that self-reporting, and by the way, on both, both the revenue

181
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,940
side and on that is really key.

182
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,860
It's why this program is very important, but we're trying to make sure that this is easy

183
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,380
for our game creators as well.

184
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,380
Yeah.

185
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,380
No, that's good.

186
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:34,100
I mean, that seems like data that, at least I've always had, if you sell games and have

187
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,700
people download them, you've got the info on how many are downloading it or how much

188
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,080
money you're making each month.

189
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,520
So, that seems relatively straightforward and a lot better than some built-in tracking

190
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,320
spyware thing that I kept hearing about.

191
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
Yeah.

192
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,080
And again, I'm sorry that I had to use the corporate jargon, but the truth is there's

193
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,160
just a lot of different scenarios in games.

194
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,080
And so, some people might say, why isn't it sales?

195
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,240
But sales doesn't work if it's a free-to-play game.

196
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,300
And so, we're trying to make sure that we can clearly define that in a way that works

197
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,580
for a bunch of different ways that Unity's used.

198
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,640
This seems pretty above board too.

199
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,020
Unity will require game developers to self-report their statistics on sales numbers and revenue

200
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,200
and number of installs, all of which Steam's backend provides to the developer.

201
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,760
Xbox's backend provides them.

202
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,700
Most storefronts provide these numbers.

203
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,880
This does mean there's a possibility that lying developers can inaccurately report their

204
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
numbers.

205
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,120
And Witten does say that if there's obvious huge discrepancies, like if a game with 10

206
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,400
million players reports to Unity 10,000 sales, they reserve the right to approach the game

207
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,620
developer about it.

208
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,320
But for the most part, they intend to just roll with self-reporting on revenue and installs.

209
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,360
Witten also clarified what was meant by an install and admits that Unity did a very bad

210
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,560
job at explaining what they meant to do.

211
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,560
That's an understatement.

212
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:17,200
Yeah, and I'm going to sound a little corporatey here for a second while I use the words around

213
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,720
it, but I'm just going to use them and then try to explain them a little bit.

214
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,280
And that's, you know, the goal is as simple as saying that it's a legitimate user of your

215
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,640
software on a particular distribution channel.

216
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,640
So okay, what's a legitimate user?

217
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,900
Well, a legitimate user would be an actual user, not your automated use, not whether

218
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:44,060
there was piracy, not someone that had bought it and instantly refunded it, but like a legitimate

219
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:49,340
first time that someone was engaging with your free-to-play game or your paid game.

220
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,540
What's a distribution channel?

221
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,980
Well, an app store is a distribution channel.

222
00:13:52,980 --> 00:14:00,500
So if that user went to a particular store and bought it or downloaded it or whatever,

223
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,040
then you would start thinking of that as sort of doing it.

224
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,520
Now if they had multiple devices or they reinstalled it, you don't count those multiple times.

225
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,680
Because I might have gotten the same thing in my library from a store that I can use

226
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,000
on a couple of different devices, great.

227
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,720
That's one, not two.

228
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,420
So there's a bunch more examples that are around that in the FAQ and we're very committed

229
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,080
to making sure that we give more details around that.

230
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:32,060
But our intent is very simple, which is that the first time that your game with our runtime

231
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:37,340
engages with a very legitimate user on a distribution channel, use that as account.

232
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:44,940
And then again, we think that many times that will be much less than this 2.5% revenue share.

233
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,980
And so you could pay less or less through that, or you just go to the revenue share

234
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,820
if you didn't want to track that.

235
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,880
Whitten also went into detail on why they went with a fee for an install rather than

236
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,360
a fee for a sale.

237
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,160
Why was there a whole install thing in the beginning anyway?

238
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,860
We think it's going to be cheaper for a lot of games.

239
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:08,520
So listen, we're trying to build a model that we think is fair and is a good value exchange

240
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:13,400
that works for games once they find a level of success.

241
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,960
And we also want to tie it to this value that Unity brings, which is our runtime that's

242
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,600
inside of the games themselves.

243
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,980
And so it felt like a way where we could tie those two pieces together.

244
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:31,940
And we think that in a pretty reasonable number of cases, that that's actually a smaller number.

245
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,340
And we think that's good.

246
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:37,820
Now what we heard, got a lot of really, really good feedback is that there were cases where

247
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,160
people first off couldn't plan because they're like, well, I don't know, maybe something's

248
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,840
going to go crazy or I have this particular scenario and that doesn't work.

249
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,260
And so adding in the 2.5% revenue share as an option, you can only use that, or where

250
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,260
you have the both.

251
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:58,060
And so you can always plan for it and hopefully do better, definitely was, frankly, my opinion

252
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,200
makes the plan better based on what we were trying to do.

253
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,600
So it was really good feedback.

254
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,140
Yeah, I was, to be honest, I said this in my streams earlier that the idea of being

255
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,540
forced on a rev share doesn't sound appealing to me, but I've come from the background of

256
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:20,540
MMOs and, you know, 50, $60 AAA games where a small install fee, we're looking at less

257
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,320
than 1% or a 1% fee.

258
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,000
So I like the option of both, but yeah, I haven't understood the argument of just force

259
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
a rev share.

260
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,320
So hopefully that doesn't change and we stay with both options.

261
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,040
I assume that's the plan.

262
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,620
Oh, that's absolutely the plan or the plan is that choice.

263
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,860
This actually sounds reasonable, like, yeah, free to play games would have no game sales

264
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,860
they could cut off.

265
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,300
Also people who just own a ton of random steam games from sales or humble bundles or something,

266
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,360
but never actually play them, they won't trigger a fee either.

267
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,220
By the way, I have a humble bundle affiliate link in the description, make sure to use

268
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,400
it to buy your games.

269
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,180
Basically, I know that it's Witten's job to put his company's best foot forward.

270
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,500
He's obviously not impartial here, but he did offer an apology and some decent reasons

271
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,440
as to why Unity decided to change their payment structure.

272
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,840
But there is a second possible reason, one that isn't quite so above board.

273
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,460
Remember when I mentioned that Unity was gobbling up companies left and right?

274
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:18,180
Well, their expansion led them to buy out IronSource back in July of 2022.

275
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,120
It's a bit tricky to figure out what IronSource actually does.

276
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,440
Their Wikipedia page lists them as a mobile games company, but they don't seem to have

277
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,720
put out any games.

278
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,420
Their website says, one platform to turn your app into a business.

279
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,940
Our platform lets you focus on what you do best, creating great apps and user experiences

280
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,540
while we take care of the rest.

281
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,120
Get the IronSource SDK to start monetizing your app and acquiring quality users.

282
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,240
SDK just stands for Software Development Kit.

283
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,800
Basically, it's a set of tools you can use to make a program.

284
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,800
So alright, they sell tools that developers use to make games, just like Unity.

285
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,480
IronSource used to sell their tools back in 2011 under the name InstallCore, and InstallCore

286
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,240
has a sordid history.

287
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,560
Various anti-virus and anti-malware applications began to label InstallCore as malware starting

288
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,120
in 2014.

289
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,820
InstallCore was an application that allowed those using it to include monetization in

290
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,640
their programs through advertising, as well as making it possible to charge companies

291
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,260
per installation through install tracking.

292
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,020
It could also add toolbars to your internet browser that were difficult to remove, record

293
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,140
your computer's processes, and send that data back home, and it was also the main reason

294
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,420
that when you went to install a legitimate application, you often found that a whole

295
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,260
bunch of other garbage got installed along with it.

296
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,660
InstallCore became one of the most infamous bits of malware of the 2010s.

297
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,960
InstallCore was phased out in 2020, having been replaced with the IronCore SDK, which

298
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,620
is basically just more of the same.

299
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,760
In fact, whenever you're on the Pirate Bay or some other torrent site or downloading

300
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,760
site, and you see a banner ad claiming to lead you to a Google Chrome install but actually

301
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,040
goes to some malware URL, that's generally IronCore's work.

302
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,080
If you were to click on one of those obvious links, IronCore would install a toolbar into

303
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,920
your browser that would display ads to you, track your internet usage, and lag the fuck

304
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,200
out of your PC.

305
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,960
Unity completed their buyout of IronSource in November of 2022.

306
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,940
As part of the deal, IronSource's CEO joined the Unity board of directors.

307
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,500
A few months later, the Unity board began the discussion of how to further monetize

308
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,060
Unity and eventually came up with the idea of a per-install fee.

309
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:16,060
It's not too much of a stretch to say that Unity, having just acquired a company that

310
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:20,740
specialized in tracking malware, might put that software to use in the tracking of their

311
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,740
users.

312
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,420
Right now, everybody's claiming Unity's now ex-CEO, John Risatello, for this whole

313
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,420
shit show.

314
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,860
There's a pretty convincing story for that interpretation of events.

315
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,020
Risatello was previously the CEO at EA, a gaming company that everyone's loved to

316
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,620
hate for about, I don't know, 30 years now.

317
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,980
He was brought into Unity back in 2014 and began to push for the company's aggressive

318
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,980
expansion.

319
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,900
During an interview, Risatello explained his logic behind Unity acquiring IronSource.

320
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:03,120
We realized we shared a common vision, and with Unity, most of the world's game content

321
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,220
is built on Unity.

322
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,420
We've also got a really strong monetization network.

323
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,980
And what we're trying to get to, you know, over the course of many years, is a platform

324
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:18,060
where a creator can make the best content and monetize the best content.

325
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:22,420
And sometimes monetization is harder than it is to build the great game.

326
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,060
If you don't have a great business to go with a great game, you don't have a great

327
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,340
game because you don't have the resources to make it.

328
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:35,080
And so here, what this is about is they have some tools that are pretty amazing that if

329
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,220
you add them to our stack, we can get to a place where a creator can get user feedback

330
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,900
on pieces of the game along the way.

331
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,660
So they know how the game or the digital twin or whatever the real-time 3D content is made

332
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,660
to be.

333
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:55,620
And they get feedback on user engagement and what's working, not working, and not working,

334
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:00,460
and also simultaneously get feedback on what it takes to acquire a user.

335
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:07,940
So the outgrowth of a unified creation and growth platform that we could put together

336
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:13,860
is really better content and a better business in a way that we think is really magical for

337
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,860
creators.

338
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,560
While I'm sure there's certainly some very positive uses for IronSource's tracking tools,

339
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,720
he does make a good case for them, it's also very easy to see how it's not all sunshine

340
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,760
and rainbows, where Satello went into more detail on the data front, specifically saying

341
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,120
more data is good.

342
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,520
means we're not dependent on any one data source, and so they've got a lot of different

343
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,560
data sources and so do we.

344
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,880
It's a large number, I can list them if you want.

345
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,520
The second is they've got a leading mediation tool, which is an important part of a full

346
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,560
stack monetization platform.

347
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:11,840
We will bring more data, more demand to that platform, and that's helpful to both companies.

348
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,280
Again, customers win, we win.

349
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,160
And third, they've got a set of publishing tools that they call SuperSonic.

350
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,360
And it's a great solution for the long tail.

351
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,960
Firstly, everybody in the long tail makes their games on Unity.

352
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,120
This is one of those peanut butter and chocolate mixes where we've got the customer that they

353
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,580
need, they've got the solution we need, and we see strong synergy in that.

354
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:38,420
When Unity went public back in September of 2020, a few choice groups bought up a significant

355
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,580
amount of their stock.

356
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:43,280
A lot of people who follow stock ownership conspiracies will likely recognize some of

357
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,280
these names.

358
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,720
Sequoia Capital, Silver Lake Management, The Vanguard Group.

359
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,560
Ironsource was even praised by the World Economic Forum as one of their preferred global growth

360
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
companies.

361
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,440
Okay, I'm not going to be diving into the Klaus Schwab rabbit hole today, I'm not prepared

362
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
for it right now.

363
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,000
And frankly, I don't think I believe a lot of it.

364
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,560
I'm bringing this up because the CEO of a public company serves at the pleasure of the

365
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,880
shareholder board.

366
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,240
Even if Risatello disagreed with the Ironsource merger, and he probably didn't, he wasn't

367
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,240
in a position to actually reject it, considering that Silver Lake and Sequoia announced an

368
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,720
additional $1 billion of investment into the company if they took the deal.

369
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,160
Risatello sold 2,000 Unity shares six days before the pricing announcement.

370
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,640
He's been selling shares of Unity all year.

371
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,040
Other executives at Unity have been doing the same.

372
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,880
I think people at Unity have a feeling that things are starting to go belly up, despite

373
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,440
their public statements otherwise.

374
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,420
And now that Unity's had a spectacular PR blowout, Risatello has probably decided that

375
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,680
now is the time for him to step down.

376
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,960
What's likely is that he saw the writing on the wall, cashed out, and abandoned the sinking

377
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
ship.

378
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,160
He may have been the accidental orchestrator of this disaster, and decided to cut his losses

379
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
and leave.

380
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,320
He might have objected to the merger and been overruled by the owners of Unity, and now

381
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,560
he's taken off before things really go tits up.

382
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,400
Either way, he's gone, and the internet has certainly decided to blame him for everything.

383
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,040
By the way, I personally believe that the Ironsource malware tracking story is probably

384
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,200
more likely than the Mark Ritten, everything is totally cool story, because Unity announced

385
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,000
that it will quietly waive all of those fees if game developers switch to their in-game

386
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,820
ad monetization service.

387
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,820
Another bit of software that came along with the Ironsource acquisition.

388
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:18,180
Oh, also because of that $1 billion invested from Sequoia and Silver Lake to make that

389
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:23,100
Ironsource deal go down smoothly, a chunk of it probably went towards executive compensation

390
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,100
packages.

391
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:29,100
$45 million over three years for Risatello, and $47 million over two years to Ritten,

392
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,620
not to mention the other executives.

393
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,220
Neil Long, reporting for the website Mobile Gamer, was contacted by sources within Unity

394
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,500
about the whole fiasco.

395
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,540
They are anonymous sources, presumably because they don't want to lose their jobs, so take

396
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,740
this with a grain of salt.

397
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,260
This was published only a few days ago on October 23rd, and it seems to be the most

398
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,780
recent news in the story.

399
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,740
I would wager a guess that now that the initial controversy has blown over, these guys felt

400
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,420
more comfortable talking to the press.

401
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:56,500
A major mobile game publisher and one of Unity's biggest clients met with John Risatello himself

402
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,140
after the first runtime fee policy was announced.

403
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,980
They directly told him, fuck you, we're not paying.

404
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,060
Unity planned to announce a 4% revenue share for games that earned over $1 million, slightly

405
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,340
undercutting Unreal Engine's 5%.

406
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:14,620
But the response was so fierce, it was knocked down to 2.5% in the second tweaked policy,

407
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,140
announced a week and a half later.

408
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,560
Before the original runtime fee announcement was made, a very large group of senior Unity

409
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,140
managers met to discuss the proposed changes.

410
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,340
Half of the people in that meeting said that the model was too complicated.

411
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,140
It wasn't going to be well-received and that they should talk to other people before they

412
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,140
do it.

413
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,380
Apparently, Unity had spoken to people, they didn't say who it was.

414
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,320
The whole thing felt very rushed.

415
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,300
They had a meeting and they were told that it was happening, but they weren't told to

416
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,300
date.

417
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,340
This actually sounds a lot like something that Mark Whitten said in that interview from

418
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,340
earlier.

419
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:16,020
feedback and we need to do better and I can tell you you know as an example on Sunday

420
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:20,860
I think it's been a long week so the days together a little bit but on Sunday I think

421
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:27,660
we put up on on X a kind of a statement saying that we'll get back to you in a couple of

422
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,080
days the reason we didn't get back to you in a couple of days is because we were as

423
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,820
we were working through the plan we were going back and talking to big customers independent

424
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:40,320
developers partners over and over again to get that feedback because I think the most

425
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:47,220
fundamental thing about talking to customers is it's it's kind of an ongoing iterative

426
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:52,780
conversation and we didn't do that well enough and you know now I'm very very convicted on

427
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,920
this policy that we're doing that the source also said that the company Apple oven is dominating

428
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,760
and unity tried to use this policy as a forcing agent to try and get back some market share

429
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,160
it was iron source and unity's play to increase their mediation business and developers have

430
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,840
been caught in the crossfire of this mediation war that's been going on for a couple of years

431
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,240
now here's the deep lore on that iron source has a competitor in the advertisements in

432
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,040
apps space called app lovin app lovin is a larger company without the reputation of spreading

433
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,520
malware around and when unity announced their desire to merge with iron source in 2022 app

434
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,640
lovin seeing their competitor merge with a major player decided to counter offer they

435
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,200
would buy unity instead and offered up 17 billion dollars for the deal unity ultimately rejected

436
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,880
them sticking with their iron source acquisition instead which cost them around 4.4 billion to

437
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,560
complete neil long reported previously on the app love and story back in september where multiple

438
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,400
game development studios using unity admitted that unity quietly offered to waive the runtime

439
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,400
fee if they switched away from app lovin and used their in-app advertisement tools instead

440
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,360
one developer specifically speculated that iron source has wanted to kill app lovin for a long

441
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,200
time and now unity as iron sources owner and with iron source executives on their board have

442
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,920
continued that goal app lovin has been dominating this specific market offering what developers

443
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,240
claim is a superior product to iron sources an iron sources game plan has been to integrate

444
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,480
themselves vertically to control access to other pieces of the market chain rather than develop

445
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,960
their own superior product the developers have also stated that this move has come from the iron

446
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,160
source side of the merged business not the unity side and that while large companies can simply

447
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,760
pay the fee small developers have no choice but to accept unity's in-app advertisement tools in

448
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,960
order to save their projects going back to the october article the anonymous sources inside unity

449
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,200
confirmed that neil long's reporting and the developer assertions from the september article

450
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,600
were actually accurate a second large mobile publisher who also refused to switch from

451
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,680
app lovin to iron source was told by the company that that was the last time you could have got

452
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,440
that money and that in the future presumably when the terms of service changed again they will be

453
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,640
forced to use iron source and that iron source's intention is to completely wipe app lovin out

454
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,120
nonetheless the source at unity doesn't believe this was done maliciously unity has lost a lot

455
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,680
of money over the last 18 years billions of dollars and they need to do something to make

456
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,480
money sadly this wasn't delivered well but the need to make more money is still there again this

457
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,360
is very similar to something witten said earlier why did you go about doing this whole thing the

458
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,120
the pricing plan change putting this up posting it out there making a lot of people angry of course

459
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,320
and then rolling it back a week later like what was the point of doing all that if you're gonna

460
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:35,120
kind of do this roll back afterwards well uh the most fundamental thing that we're trying to do is

461
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,080
we're building a sustainable business for unity and for us that means that we do need to have a

462
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:46,240
model that includes some sort of balanced exchange including shared success that's really really

463
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,520
important for the the long-term future of how we think about um our business how we think about the

464
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,480
engine and the main reason is really clear it has to be a sustainable business we want to keep

465
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,400
massively and deeply investing in the engine we want to make sure that we can build the best

466
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,040
editor and runtime for everyone to build the games today and tomorrow and that's the reason why we

467
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:12,320
work on it very very focused on that it's very important for unity according to like your

468
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,080
internal projections is this going to be enough to just keep things stable or do you feel like

469
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:25,040
you're going to need to re-evaluate in another year or two uh well listen you know when we make

470
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,920
a shift that says that it doesn't start until next year obviously that means that games that

471
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,560
are participating in the runtime are going to come later so like there's a shift on sort of where some

472
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,440
of that comes but this is about a business model transition this isn't about hey we need to do

473
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,000
something for the next three months or something like that this is about setting up the foundation

474
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,920
of the company this this program is critical for us for the foundation of the company

475
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,960
to be able to continue to invest for a very very long period of time so if the shape kind of is

476
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,280
like this you know like a little shape that goes like this versus being earlier that's less

477
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,280
relevant than making sure that we have a right program that works for our creators that's why

478
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,440
i believe that this is a better program because i think we got great feedback to make it a better

479
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,920
program and works for unity it's not just resatella who's decided to abandon the unity

480
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,000
sinking ship the source mentioned that many people have begun to apply elsewhere in the

481
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,440
games industry the writing's on the wall unity stock was at 200 in november of 2021

482
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,720
well before the iron source merger while it's now sitting at around 26 what makes this really funny

483
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,280
is that unity stock price has collapsed so much since this shit show began that applevan can

484
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,800
actually afford to just buy them outright again which they are currently considering

485
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,880
but it turns out despite whitman's remarks about the thresholds and whatever else in that interview

486
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,640
the people who will actually be affected by the changes at unity are the middle of the road

487
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,600
creators the unity source remarked that a lot of the outcry from indie devs was misplaced as none

488
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,080
of them will ever get anywhere near the 1 million dollar threshold anyway that rules out the indie

489
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,280
underclass meanwhile anyone in a bigger developer's business team or sales team is going to be able to

490
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:00,640
reduce those fees some big clients might leave other big clients might keep using unity and

491
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,200
simply pay a fee to avoid switching over to applevan that rules out the big names the only

492
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,440
ones who are going to start seeing serious money losses are the successful indies who are nonetheless

493
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,800
still a small companies like the hollow knights and the shovel knights and the undertales of the

494
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,760
world it's these people who will feel the pinch from unity so that brings us to the end is it

495
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,440
possible that unity was actually going okay not great but okay until deciding to buy iron source

496
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,920
a plague blanket of a company a deal which the executives were incentivized to take due to a

497
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,680
fat stack of cash provided to them by their investors which explains why they rejected

498
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:36,640
the applevan counteroffer a deal which left unity on the hook for a huge bill as well as ownership

499
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,400
of a bunch of tracking software that they had to somehow monetize leading them to pull this

500
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,960
retarded stunt on their own consumer base causing consumer confidence in their product to completely

501
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,200
vanish ending with the whole house of cards collapsing it's entirely possible but without

502
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,840
detailed information about the various mergers and acquisitions we can't be sure what we do know is

503
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,840
that individual on the ground game developers don't trust unity anymore publishers don't trust unity

504
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,600
anymore gamers don't trust unity anymore no one trusts unity anymore trust is hard to earn and

505
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,440
easy to lose and unity burned over a decade of trust in one swift stupid move many game developers

506
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,600
are pledging to move their games over from unity if possible others are saying that their next

507
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,720
titles won't use unity people are already beginning to make quick conversion tools for people moving

508
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,760
their stuff from unity to unreal or whatever people are asking if it's legal for unity to

509
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,000
simply unilaterally change the terms of service and they're finding out that as long as there's

510
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,920
enough time before changes are implemented and as long as customers re-sign the deal next time they

511
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,480
boot up the application companies that offer a service can change that service as they see fit

512
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,040
they're not bound to do the exact same thing in perpetuity just because you want them to

513
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,680
this next question is one i have been wondering and i don't know anything about and they were

514
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:53,040
wondering if it's legal to change the terms of service overnight and i don't know if it was

515
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,440
necessarily overnight but do you know i don't know anything about the legal side of this stuff

516
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,080
all i've heard is random speculation from people who are also not lawyers well i mean i mean i

517
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,160
think at sort of one level uh all companies change their terms over time you know frequently and

518
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,240
constantly and consistently you know because frankly the world changes gaming is a very

519
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,880
dynamic world the world we live in is dynamic and there are obviously always new things that are

520
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,280
that are being added or whatever however i want to back up from that and say you know it kind of

521
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,200
comes back to your trust point which is i think one thing that i heard a lot is people very very

522
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,000
deeply need to know what they're signing up for when they pick a version of unity to build their

523
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,200
game on and that they can you know be sure that they can continue to use that and i think that

524
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,600
feedback and there's a lot of other things that come along with trust so i just want to be clear

525
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,240
but that feedback is really really really super clear and that's one reason why you know what i

526
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,880
talked about today we're going to make sure that you can do that the problem with this all is that

527
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:56,560
it requires trust the very thing that unity has just torched customers need to trust that unity

528
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,760
is not darth vader altering the deal on a whim in some unfair way and that's out the window now

529
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,840
whitton did state in that interview that they haven't seen a significant drop in unity developers

530
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,160
like do you know that there's been a dip in users or is that something that you have to wait a

531
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:17,600
little while to see i mean i listen i see all of it on uh like any channel where we get feedback

532
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:23,520
obviously we see all the the feedback i haven't seen anything in our like actual numbers uh that

533
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,160
would show that not saying that that means it's not happening uh and i i will just say that it's

534
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,600
my job to make sure that we build the best product um so that um people don't want to do that and

535
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,680
that they want to stay on unity and build great games that might be true we probably won't know

536
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,960
until their next quarterly report despite all the backlash and all the pr spin from unity they

537
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,280
ultimately still aren't backing down i don't even necessarily begrudge them for wanting to make a

538
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,880
bit more money they're not exactly making tons of it right now though i do know where they probably

539
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:57,440
could pull a few bucks we rift or essentially reduce um some job categories for total about

540
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,280
250 and of course i i feel deeply about every individual so don't get me wrong the story for

541
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:09,120
one person is paid so i want to be clear about whenever there's job losses and most unity users

542
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:14,400
do actually pay them nothing for the use of their product but they bungled this so badly it might

543
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,840
actually mean the end of unity and that means i'm probably never getting hollow knight silks on

544
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,400
god damn it all right guys that about does it for me i know i'm late to the unity story we talked

545
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,520
about it on the archcast like a month ago for example but my laziness or my my prudence has

546
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,920
paid off if you want to hear more from me naomi and i recently recorded a vlog where we watched

547
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,800
the classic film they live in theaters click on the link on screen and i'll see you over there

548
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,640
have a good one guys i love you
