0	4740	Social justice has a way of taking the meaning of a word or symbol and completely swapping
4740	8840	it with a different meaning in the cultural zeitgeist, regardless of the factual accuracy
8840	9840	of the swap.
9840	13280	To use an old fallback, an obvious example would be the gamergate hashtag.
13280	17440	We all know that gamergate was never about misogyny or issues of representation in video
17440	18440	games.
18440	21600	It was about corruption within the game industry, specifically the indie developers and the
21600	22920	enthusiast press.
22920	27420	But because the people accused by gamergate held all the power, gamergate became a symbol
27420	28420	of misogyny.
28560	32900	It's why the Wikipedia page on gamergate states, in its very first line, that the gamergate
32900	37020	controversy stemmed from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the
37020	38500	hashtag gamergate.
38500	42420	This isn't true, but it's how the normies see it, due to the way social justice warriors
42420	46860	twist meanings around and use their institutional power to make those meanings stick.
46860	51700	This is why most memes involving social justice authoritarians reference 1984's Ministry
51700	56420	of Truth, because both organizations peddle lies as truth as a matter of course.
56420	61340	But it's also why SJWs hate memes and meme culture and shitposters, because the memetic
61340	65240	transmission of ideas is a popular form of information transfer that they can't control
65240	66240	from the top down.
66240	69860	The only thing they can do is compete with memes of their own, and as we all know, the
69860	70920	left can't meme.
70920	74500	So when 4chan discovered that the progressive answer to meme culture was to force everything
74500	79840	that your average internet user liked to be racist or sexist, from video games and YouTubers
79840	84680	to Pepe and Wojak, they discovered the ultimate way to make SJWs look like nutcases.
84680	88520	Make innocuous symbols, put the word out on social media that they're actually codes
88520	92800	used by the alt-right, and watch the radical lefties tar and feather themselves in the
92800	96360	media, trying to demonize or outright ban these symbols.
96360	98960	After all, this is what they did with the OK Hand symbol.
98960	102600	After the mainstream media began to notice that Trump and his supporters regularly made
102600	107380	the OK Hand symbol, 4chan's poll board thought up Operation OKKK.
107380	111560	We must flood Twitter and other social media websites with spam, claiming that the OK Hand
111560	115600	sign is a symbol of white supremacy, make fake accounts with basic white girl names
115600	118120	and type shit like, OMG that's so true.
118120	122480	Leftists have dug so deep down into their lunacy, we must force them to dig more until
122480	125000	the rest of society ain't going anywhere near that shit.
125000	126360	And that's exactly what happened.
126360	129960	From Mike Cernovich in the White House, to Brett Kavanaugh's law clerk in the background,
129960	134120	to Overwatch League spectators in the crowd, the OK Hand sign, one of the most innocuous
134120	137240	gestures in human history, became a symbol of white supremacy.
137240	141240	And considering the radical left's constant corruption of cultural symbology, it was very
141240	143320	easy to manipulate them into doing it.
143320	147060	Think about it, when the leftist ideologues see their political opponents doing something,
147060	152100	saying something, or being something, that thing must automatically become a symbol of
152100	156920	patriarchal oppression, aka a symbol of the everyman's resistance to their indoctrination.
156920	157920	So video games?
157920	161880	A cesspool of hate because the people who play them, the gamers, disagree with their
161880	162880	politics.
162880	163880	YouTube?
163880	168080	Full of alt-right personalities radicalizing their young audiences, because YouTubers almost
168080	169840	always disagree with their politics.
169840	172480	Pepe and Wojak and the OK Hand symbol?
172480	174800	Used by their opponents, so they're symbols of hate.
174800	179400	You could tell an SJW that the alt-right breathes air, and they'd condemn air as racist, and
179400	181200	then hold their breath until they keeled over.
181200	185360	Hell, they've already sworn off milk as a symbol of white power, falling for a similar
185360	187880	4chan operation as OKKK.
187880	188880	What's next?
188880	189880	How about the thumbs up sign?
189880	191160	Sure, why the fuck not?
191160	194740	White supremacists are using this gesture to assert their ideology through code.
194740	196100	Be aware, stop the hate.
196100	198200	How long until this one becomes the next thing?
198200	203240	I mean, if everything is sexist, everything is racist, surely thumbs up is too, right?
203240	205520	Or hell, how about the LGBT rainbow flag?
205520	207640	Let's make that an alt-right logo as well.
207640	209640	A separate place for every race.
209640	211080	Respect diversity.
211080	213120	Preserve the uniqueness of your own culture.
213120	217760	This stuff is stupid, but it's ideologically consistent with the radical left, so the radical
217760	220200	left has to take the bait every time.
220200	225040	You can force them to consider any symbol, any picture, any gesture or slogan as an alt-right
225040	226720	code for the supremacy of the white race.
226720	229840	They'll just lap it up because ideologically they have no other choice.
229840	232240	They'll continually cede ground in the culture war.
232240	237080	They'll keep saying that this or that is not OK to say or do or display.
237080	240760	And I do think that this behavior is why the normies are just getting fed up with social
240760	241760	justice.
241760	246640	The OK hand symbol is obviously not a white supremacist code gesture, and when the SJWs
246640	251080	treat people who innocuously make the gesture as if they were bonafide Nazis, those people
251080	253280	understandably get pissed off at them.
253280	254960	The trolls are going to keep doing this, you know?
255000	259240	They'll keep claiming that completely normal, everyday things are white supremacy in action.
259240	264040	The SJWs will keep pushing to have those normal, everyday things banned or shunned using their
264040	267680	many positions of influence, and the public will continue to turn on social justice because
267680	269560	of how far up its own ass it's gone.
269560	272960	Yeah, Blizzard, you can kick a kid doing the OK sign out of the crowd, but are you going
272960	275840	to remove Zenyatta from Overwatch because he does the same symbol?
275840	280520	Just like the LGBT flag as an alt-right logo op, eventually the shitposters will co-op
280520	283780	something the social justice establishment just cannot abandon.
283780	286900	At least not without a lot of hardship, and we're going to be treated with another example
286900	290820	of the left cannibalizing itself, and these memesters know exactly what they're doing
290820	291820	too.
291820	294880	That's why the most recent meme to take off is the clown world honk honk one.
294880	295880	Look at this fucking Pepe.
295880	297180	You know what this says to me?
297180	301180	Yeah, I may be a clown, but you idiots are the ones taking my nonsense seriously.
301180	303180	I'm the joke, and you're the fucking punchline.
303180	307560	A good way to think of it is, the side that values liberty and free speech is the wellspring
307560	308560	of memes.
308560	312360	It's where thought goes unbridled, it's where creativity flourishes beyond the bounds
312360	313560	of polite society.
313560	317160	If the authoritarian left can't meme, it's because their restrictive nature prevents
317160	318240	them from doing so.
318240	322200	The opposing side, the side that takes the symbology and corrupts it for its own purposes,
322200	323520	is the camp of the authoritarian.
323520	328720	However, their ideology blinds them in a sense, so the most skillful meme-smiths are able
328720	332600	to manipulate authoritarians into corrupting memes in such a way that they undermine their
332600	333600	own position.
333600	337800	I know I mentioned the authoritarian left, but this is independent of political ideology.
337800	341300	The Nazis also took a positive symbol and made it into a negative one.
341300	344140	And Nazi propaganda also ended up becoming a laughing stock.
344140	346080	It's the same with social justice today.
346080	350340	The honest truth is, I'm not going to change my behavior because the SJWs fell for a troll
350340	353300	and now think that everyday things make me a white supremacist.
353300	356820	I'm not one, and not playing by their rules doesn't make me one.
356820	358260	I'm happy to troll them, though.
358260	361700	If they're going to be stupid enough to accuse the average person of racism where
361700	366020	none exists, then I formally declare that the symbol of feminism is secretly a symbol
366020	367020	of white power.
367020	371700	A white fist within the letters O and T, standing for order and truth.
371700	373620	Go ahead, eat each other over it.
