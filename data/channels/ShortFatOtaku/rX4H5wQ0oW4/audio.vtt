00:00.000 --> 00:04.740
Social justice has a way of taking the meaning of a word or symbol and completely swapping

00:04.740 --> 00:08.840
it with a different meaning in the cultural zeitgeist, regardless of the factual accuracy

00:08.840 --> 00:09.840
of the swap.

00:09.840 --> 00:13.280
To use an old fallback, an obvious example would be the gamergate hashtag.

00:13.280 --> 00:17.440
We all know that gamergate was never about misogyny or issues of representation in video

00:17.440 --> 00:18.440
games.

00:18.440 --> 00:21.600
It was about corruption within the game industry, specifically the indie developers and the

00:21.600 --> 00:22.920
enthusiast press.

00:22.920 --> 00:27.420
But because the people accused by gamergate held all the power, gamergate became a symbol

00:27.420 --> 00:28.420
of misogyny.

00:28.560 --> 00:32.900
It's why the Wikipedia page on gamergate states, in its very first line, that the gamergate

00:32.900 --> 00:37.020
controversy stemmed from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the

00:37.020 --> 00:38.500
hashtag gamergate.

00:38.500 --> 00:42.420
This isn't true, but it's how the normies see it, due to the way social justice warriors

00:42.420 --> 00:46.860
twist meanings around and use their institutional power to make those meanings stick.

00:46.860 --> 00:51.700
This is why most memes involving social justice authoritarians reference 1984's Ministry

00:51.700 --> 00:56.420
of Truth, because both organizations peddle lies as truth as a matter of course.

00:56.420 --> 01:01.340
But it's also why SJWs hate memes and meme culture and shitposters, because the memetic

01:01.340 --> 01:05.240
transmission of ideas is a popular form of information transfer that they can't control

01:05.240 --> 01:06.240
from the top down.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.860
The only thing they can do is compete with memes of their own, and as we all know, the

01:09.860 --> 01:10.920
left can't meme.

01:10.920 --> 01:14.500
So when 4chan discovered that the progressive answer to meme culture was to force everything

01:14.500 --> 01:19.840
that your average internet user liked to be racist or sexist, from video games and YouTubers

01:19.840 --> 01:24.680
to Pepe and Wojak, they discovered the ultimate way to make SJWs look like nutcases.

01:24.680 --> 01:28.520
Make innocuous symbols, put the word out on social media that they're actually codes

01:28.520 --> 01:32.800
used by the alt-right, and watch the radical lefties tar and feather themselves in the

01:32.800 --> 01:36.360
media, trying to demonize or outright ban these symbols.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.960
After all, this is what they did with the OK Hand symbol.

01:38.960 --> 01:42.600
After the mainstream media began to notice that Trump and his supporters regularly made

01:42.600 --> 01:47.380
the OK Hand symbol, 4chan's poll board thought up Operation OKKK.

01:47.380 --> 01:51.560
We must flood Twitter and other social media websites with spam, claiming that the OK Hand

01:51.560 --> 01:55.600
sign is a symbol of white supremacy, make fake accounts with basic white girl names

01:55.600 --> 01:58.120
and type shit like, OMG that's so true.

01:58.120 --> 02:02.480
Leftists have dug so deep down into their lunacy, we must force them to dig more until

02:02.480 --> 02:05.000
the rest of society ain't going anywhere near that shit.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.360
And that's exactly what happened.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.960
From Mike Cernovich in the White House, to Brett Kavanaugh's law clerk in the background,

02:09.960 --> 02:14.120
to Overwatch League spectators in the crowd, the OK Hand sign, one of the most innocuous

02:14.120 --> 02:17.240
gestures in human history, became a symbol of white supremacy.

02:17.240 --> 02:21.240
And considering the radical left's constant corruption of cultural symbology, it was very

02:21.240 --> 02:23.320
easy to manipulate them into doing it.

02:23.320 --> 02:27.060
Think about it, when the leftist ideologues see their political opponents doing something,

02:27.060 --> 02:32.100
saying something, or being something, that thing must automatically become a symbol of

02:32.100 --> 02:36.920
patriarchal oppression, aka a symbol of the everyman's resistance to their indoctrination.

02:36.920 --> 02:37.920
So video games?

02:37.920 --> 02:41.880
A cesspool of hate because the people who play them, the gamers, disagree with their

02:41.880 --> 02:42.880
politics.

02:42.880 --> 02:43.880
YouTube?

02:43.880 --> 02:48.080
Full of alt-right personalities radicalizing their young audiences, because YouTubers almost

02:48.080 --> 02:49.840
always disagree with their politics.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.480
Pepe and Wojak and the OK Hand symbol?

02:52.480 --> 02:54.800
Used by their opponents, so they're symbols of hate.

02:54.800 --> 02:59.400
You could tell an SJW that the alt-right breathes air, and they'd condemn air as racist, and

02:59.400 --> 03:01.200
then hold their breath until they keeled over.

03:01.200 --> 03:05.360
Hell, they've already sworn off milk as a symbol of white power, falling for a similar

03:05.360 --> 03:07.880
4chan operation as OKKK.

03:07.880 --> 03:08.880
What's next?

03:08.880 --> 03:09.880
How about the thumbs up sign?

03:09.880 --> 03:11.160
Sure, why the fuck not?

03:11.160 --> 03:14.740
White supremacists are using this gesture to assert their ideology through code.

03:14.740 --> 03:16.100
Be aware, stop the hate.

03:16.100 --> 03:18.200
How long until this one becomes the next thing?

03:18.200 --> 03:23.240
I mean, if everything is sexist, everything is racist, surely thumbs up is too, right?

03:23.240 --> 03:25.520
Or hell, how about the LGBT rainbow flag?

03:25.520 --> 03:27.640
Let's make that an alt-right logo as well.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.640
A separate place for every race.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.080
Respect diversity.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.120
Preserve the uniqueness of your own culture.

03:33.120 --> 03:37.760
This stuff is stupid, but it's ideologically consistent with the radical left, so the radical

03:37.760 --> 03:40.200
left has to take the bait every time.

03:40.200 --> 03:45.040
You can force them to consider any symbol, any picture, any gesture or slogan as an alt-right

03:45.040 --> 03:46.720
code for the supremacy of the white race.

03:46.720 --> 03:49.840
They'll just lap it up because ideologically they have no other choice.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.240
They'll continually cede ground in the culture war.

03:52.240 --> 03:57.080
They'll keep saying that this or that is not OK to say or do or display.

03:57.080 --> 04:00.760
And I do think that this behavior is why the normies are just getting fed up with social

04:00.760 --> 04:01.760
justice.

04:01.760 --> 04:06.640
The OK hand symbol is obviously not a white supremacist code gesture, and when the SJWs

04:06.640 --> 04:11.080
treat people who innocuously make the gesture as if they were bonafide Nazis, those people

04:11.080 --> 04:13.280
understandably get pissed off at them.

04:13.280 --> 04:14.960
The trolls are going to keep doing this, you know?

04:15.000 --> 04:19.240
They'll keep claiming that completely normal, everyday things are white supremacy in action.

04:19.240 --> 04:24.040
The SJWs will keep pushing to have those normal, everyday things banned or shunned using their

04:24.040 --> 04:27.680
many positions of influence, and the public will continue to turn on social justice because

04:27.680 --> 04:29.560
of how far up its own ass it's gone.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.960
Yeah, Blizzard, you can kick a kid doing the OK sign out of the crowd, but are you going

04:32.960 --> 04:35.840
to remove Zenyatta from Overwatch because he does the same symbol?

04:35.840 --> 04:40.520
Just like the LGBT flag as an alt-right logo op, eventually the shitposters will co-op

04:40.520 --> 04:43.780
something the social justice establishment just cannot abandon.

04:43.780 --> 04:46.900
At least not without a lot of hardship, and we're going to be treated with another example

04:46.900 --> 04:50.820
of the left cannibalizing itself, and these memesters know exactly what they're doing

04:50.820 --> 04:51.820
too.

04:51.820 --> 04:54.880
That's why the most recent meme to take off is the clown world honk honk one.

04:54.880 --> 04:55.880
Look at this fucking Pepe.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.180
You know what this says to me?

04:57.180 --> 05:01.180
Yeah, I may be a clown, but you idiots are the ones taking my nonsense seriously.

05:01.180 --> 05:03.180
I'm the joke, and you're the fucking punchline.

05:03.180 --> 05:07.560
A good way to think of it is, the side that values liberty and free speech is the wellspring

05:07.560 --> 05:08.560
of memes.

05:08.560 --> 05:12.360
It's where thought goes unbridled, it's where creativity flourishes beyond the bounds

05:12.360 --> 05:13.560
of polite society.

05:13.560 --> 05:17.160
If the authoritarian left can't meme, it's because their restrictive nature prevents

05:17.160 --> 05:18.240
them from doing so.

05:18.240 --> 05:22.200
The opposing side, the side that takes the symbology and corrupts it for its own purposes,

05:22.200 --> 05:23.520
is the camp of the authoritarian.

05:23.520 --> 05:28.720
However, their ideology blinds them in a sense, so the most skillful meme-smiths are able

05:28.720 --> 05:32.600
to manipulate authoritarians into corrupting memes in such a way that they undermine their

05:32.600 --> 05:33.600
own position.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.800
I know I mentioned the authoritarian left, but this is independent of political ideology.

05:37.800 --> 05:41.300
The Nazis also took a positive symbol and made it into a negative one.

05:41.300 --> 05:44.140
And Nazi propaganda also ended up becoming a laughing stock.

05:44.140 --> 05:46.080
It's the same with social justice today.

05:46.080 --> 05:50.340
The honest truth is, I'm not going to change my behavior because the SJWs fell for a troll

05:50.340 --> 05:53.300
and now think that everyday things make me a white supremacist.

05:53.300 --> 05:56.820
I'm not one, and not playing by their rules doesn't make me one.

05:56.820 --> 05:58.260
I'm happy to troll them, though.

05:58.260 --> 06:01.700
If they're going to be stupid enough to accuse the average person of racism where

06:01.700 --> 06:06.020
none exists, then I formally declare that the symbol of feminism is secretly a symbol

06:06.020 --> 06:07.020
of white power.

06:07.020 --> 06:11.700
A white fist within the letters O and T, standing for order and truth.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.620
Go ahead, eat each other over it.
