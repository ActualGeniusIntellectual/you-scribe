0	25240	Oh, what's this, Jack? Why is everyone mad at you? Why do you get heckled wherever you
25240	29740	go? And you know what? It's not just the hecklers. It seems like the world's governments
29780	36740	are finally taking notice of Twitter. India to Twitter. Comply with IT rules or face unintended
36740	41340	consequences. India's new rules, which were announced in February and which became effective
41340	46200	at the end of last month, are aimed at regulating content on social media and making firms such
46200	52300	as Facebook, its WhatsApp messenger, and Twitter more accountable to legal requests. They also
52300	57420	require big social media companies to set up grievance redressal mechanisms and appoint
57420	62780	new executives to coordinate with law enforcement. Back at the start of the year, Uganda decided
62780	66100	to take a swing at Twitter too. Ahead of the Ugandan election, we're hearing reports that
66100	70660	the internet service providers are being ordered to block social media and messaging apps.
70660	75940	We strongly condemn internet shutdowns. They are hugely harmful, violate basic human rights
75940	79980	and the principles of the open internet. Oh, internet access and social media is a human
79980	84740	right now. In fact, take that even further. When Nigeria decided to ban Twitter a few
84740	89600	days ago, nationwide, Twitter had a similar response. We are deeply concerned by the blocking
89600	94180	of Twitter in Nigeria. Access to the free and open internet is an essential human right
94180	99180	in modern society. We will work to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on
99180	103260	Twitter to communicate and connect with the world. Now, I'm not here to simp for Nigeria
103260	109500	or Uganda or whatever, but an essential human right, eh? This is a topic I did a video on
109500	113380	before, called Health Care is Not a Human Right. And just as a reminder, that video
113380	117540	wasn't actually anti-universal healthcare. I simply pointed out that universal healthcare
117540	123060	is a privilege that rich nations should provide to its population, but it wasn't a right.
123060	127240	Because a right is something that is inalienable, meaning that force can't take it from you
127240	131180	without killing you. This is why, for example, you have a right to free speech. If you're
131180	134940	standing on public property and saying whatever you want, people can hate what you're saying,
134940	138860	they can hate you, you might lose your job or something. But the actual physical action
138860	143200	of speaking, they must use violence on you to stop it. That's why a right is something
143240	147720	that is intrinsic to you. If you have a right to healthcare, that means that even if you
147720	152640	can't pay for the healthcare, even if the doctors don't get paid at all by anybody,
152640	155760	if they don't give you healthcare, even if they have a good reason not to, they're
155760	159800	violating your rights. A conception of rights that requires somebody else to take a positive
159800	164060	action for you means that they have the ability to compel your labor. This is why healthcare
164060	169080	is not a right, but speech is. But okay, Twitter, even though it's not, if you think that
169080	173340	access to your service is an essential human right, let's take a quick look at how you've
173340	178840	treated those rights over the years. In 2019, Twitter declined to confirm if people could
178840	183760	or could not post that transsexualism is a mental disorder. Now that's some pretty
183760	188040	inflammatory language, it's not something that I would say. But we did learn later that
188040	192520	no, posting this kind of language gets you banned. And if Twitter access is an essential
192520	197640	right, I guess transphobes don't have rights. Alright, Twitter has banned users for using
197640	204040	Elton John songs in video remixes. A number of Brexit party supporters were banned off
204040	209000	of Twitter. And although researchers say that many of them aren't behaving like genuine
209000	214160	voters due to posting at high volumes, short intervals and at odd times of the day, it
214160	219120	does turn out that based on its internal tools, Twitter is confident that the accounts flagged
219120	224460	by BuzzFeed news are those of real people in the UK despite their seemingly suspicious
224460	229300	activity. Nick Monroe was not allowed to post about threats against New Zealand's Prime
229300	234240	Minister. He was forced to delete his tweet, reporting that the New Zealand Prime Minister
234240	240200	had received a copy of the Christchurch Shooters Manifesto before it happened. Nick Monroe
240200	244780	would later be banned for his other tweets, including one where he says that he likes
244780	251780	it when his fans suck his cock. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey admitted to the US House of Representatives
251780	257440	in 2018 that they were unfairly filtering 600,000 accounts, but it wasn't politically
257440	262940	motivated. Twitter believes that this random person intends to build a time machine just
262940	267020	so that they can rape women from different time periods. This is a video of Pennsylvania
267020	273100	State Representative Brian Sims calling for protesters praying outside of a planned parenthood
273100	278100	to be doxxed. The video and Brian Sims are still allowed on Twitter. A Twitter executive
278100	284740	was revealed to be a British Army PSYOPs soldier whose job was to spread disinformation
284740	291300	on social media. Gordon McMillan, who joined Twitter in 2013 and is listed as the company's
291300	297980	head of editorial for EMEA, also serves with the 77th Brigade, an outfit formed in 2015
297980	303780	to conduct information warfare and develop non-lethal ways of conducting war. On February
303780	309220	4, 2020, Twitter decided that its users may not deceptively share synthetic or manipulated
309220	314580	media that are likely to cause harm. In addition, they may label tweets containing synthetic
314580	318700	and manipulated media to help people understand their authenticity and to provide context.
318700	324220	This was widely reported on as banning memes, since all of Photoshop falls under this rule.
324220	329300	Olinda Hassan, a policy manager at Twitter Trust and Safety, was caught on video stating
329300	333500	that Twitter was trying to get the shitty people to not show up. It's a product thing
333540	338500	that we're working on. Former Twitter employees have been charged with spying for Saudi Arabia
338500	344060	by digging into the accounts of the kingdom's critics. Twitter says that Trump's Thugs tweet
344060	349940	about Minneapolis protests violated standards by glorifying violence. And of course, I don't
349940	355020	think we need to go into the constant back and forth between Twitter and Trump during
355020	360540	the course of his presidency. Twitter is considering subscriptions amid an advertising slump. Subscriptions
360540	365500	to remember an essential right. These are some leaked backend shots from Twitter if
365500	369820	you'll recall from like a year or two ago. And you'll notice these tags placed on some
369820	375940	of these Twitter accounts. Permanently suspended, suspended, bounced, protected, bounced, inactive,
375940	381740	protected, compromised, trends blacklisted, search blacklisted, read only. Remember, Twitter
381740	387900	told Congress that they didn't blacklist people. And imagine being temporarily suspended, permanently
387900	394620	suspended or blacklisted from an essential right. This individual posted, Dear God, who
394620	400420	is the absolute boomer retard running your social media. But before she could post it,
400420	404320	Twitter asked her to revise it. And here's the questionnaire that Twitter forced her
404320	408820	to fill out. Why do you believe you receive this message to revise your tweet? Did your
408820	413340	tweet contain language that recipients of it might find offensive? Do you agree or disagree
413340	418140	with the following statements about your tweet? And strangely enough, which of the
418140	423340	following describes your race and ethnicity? Is Twitter saying that the status of this
423340	429540	essential right changes based on your race? The account always actions was banned, but
429540	434040	only after Trump retweeted them. They were your generic conservative Twitter account
434040	438060	where they posted videos of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protests getting violent. The White
438060	443180	House press secretary had her access to Twitter revoked when she posted about the Hunter Biden
443180	447500	email leaks back before the election. Twitter said that they don't permit the use of their
447500	452740	service to directly distribute content obtained through hacking that contains private information
452740	457180	may put people in physical harm or danger or contains trade secrets. Of course, this
457180	461220	wasn't applied evenly when it came to stuff like the Trump piss dossier a few years ago.
461220	465420	And of course, there's the fact that currently right now on Twitter, people are talking about
465420	471040	memes from Hunter Biden's laptop, which are surely leaked or hacked materials. But no
471040	475860	one cares anymore. The editor at the New York Post, one of the nation's largest papers
475860	481480	by circulation, was not allowed by Twitter to post one of their own stories that details
481480	486120	corruption by a major party presidential candidate, Joe Biden. Other accounts that posted that
486120	492440	article were also banned. Twitter considers US government websites to be unsafe. Bill
492440	497920	Cosby convicted for rape is still on Twitter. Twitter is developing an anti troll feature
497920	502320	called Safety Mode. It will automatically block accounts that are spammy, use insults,
502320	507620	strong language or hateful remarks. Vijaya Gadd, Jack's shield from Tim Pool during the
507620	512600	Joe Rogan podcast, has stated that Twitter has plans for political censorship on a global
512600	516920	scale. The National Archives, which creates copies of everything that a president says
516920	521200	publicly, has requested Twitter for an archive of Donald Trump's Twitter account. Twitter
521200	527140	has refused. Twitter once banned everyone who said the word Memphis on their platform.
527140	532480	Ramzan Kadriov, the Chechen leader who rounded up gay people and tortured and murdered them
532480	537700	in concentration camps, is still allowed on Twitter. The leader of the Islamic Republic
537700	544020	of Iran has openly called for genocide against the Jews on Twitter. Erdogan, the leader of
544020	549400	Turkey, announced his own ethnic cleansing on Twitter. Meanwhile, shitposting hero The
549400	555080	Hindu-Dindu, Brick, was banned for tweeting, Don't like being banned Twitter? Make your
555080	561000	own Uganda? Twitter has openly stated that they will ban people for tweeting at somebody
561000	565920	without their permission, and Twitter's terms of service directly state that you may
565920	573320	be banned for no reason at all. Even as other websites rise and fall, YTMND is dead, Newgrounds
573320	578540	is a shadow of its former self, most abandonware sites are gone, and GOG didn't really pick
578540	583560	up the slack. All of those random Japanese GeoCities sites with obscure information about
583560	588560	niche manga or games or anime disappeared into the bowels of the internet. But, like
588560	593680	plastic in the ocean, Twitter will be here forever. And it's a good thing! After all,
593680	597880	it's an essential human right. However, I think it's really important to notice exactly
597880	603020	who Twitter is extending this essential human right to. Which people are banned for minor
603020	608020	infractions or literally nothing sometimes? Which people can do the most heinous things
608020	613220	on and off platform, and yet their essential human right of access to this service is respected
613220	617900	no matter what? Answer that question and you will discover what type of human Twitter
617900	621540	considers to have rights. Ah shit, I forgot the most important one. You could do anything
621540	625580	on 2007 to 2012 Twitter. I showed people how to cut crack in the microwave and nothing
625580	630300	happened. Now I can't even call a fat bitch fat. Alright my friends, thanks for watching.
630300	633700	Yes, this video was a bit more low effort than the last, but I did want to get something
633700	638580	out today. I've spent the majority of my time preparing for the E3 stream happening
638580	642500	shortly. Shortly at least if you're watching this video on release. If you are, hit up
642500	646540	that Twitch channel in the pinned comment, and I'll see you soon. Alright guys, I'll
646540	649820	see you there at the stream. Thanks very much. Have a good one, and I love you.
