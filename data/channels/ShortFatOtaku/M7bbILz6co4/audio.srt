1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,240
Oh, what's this, Jack? Why is everyone mad at you? Why do you get heckled wherever you

2
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,740
go? And you know what? It's not just the hecklers. It seems like the world's governments

3
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:36,740
are finally taking notice of Twitter. India to Twitter. Comply with IT rules or face unintended

4
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,340
consequences. India's new rules, which were announced in February and which became effective

5
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,200
at the end of last month, are aimed at regulating content on social media and making firms such

6
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,300
as Facebook, its WhatsApp messenger, and Twitter more accountable to legal requests. They also

7
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,420
require big social media companies to set up grievance redressal mechanisms and appoint

8
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,780
new executives to coordinate with law enforcement. Back at the start of the year, Uganda decided

9
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,100
to take a swing at Twitter too. Ahead of the Ugandan election, we're hearing reports that

10
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,660
the internet service providers are being ordered to block social media and messaging apps.

11
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,940
We strongly condemn internet shutdowns. They are hugely harmful, violate basic human rights

12
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,980
and the principles of the open internet. Oh, internet access and social media is a human

13
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,740
right now. In fact, take that even further. When Nigeria decided to ban Twitter a few

14
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,600
days ago, nationwide, Twitter had a similar response. We are deeply concerned by the blocking

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,180
of Twitter in Nigeria. Access to the free and open internet is an essential human right

16
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:39,180
in modern society. We will work to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on

17
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,260
Twitter to communicate and connect with the world. Now, I'm not here to simp for Nigeria

18
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:49,500
or Uganda or whatever, but an essential human right, eh? This is a topic I did a video on

19
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,380
before, called Health Care is Not a Human Right. And just as a reminder, that video

20
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,540
wasn't actually anti-universal healthcare. I simply pointed out that universal healthcare

21
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,060
is a privilege that rich nations should provide to its population, but it wasn't a right.

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,240
Because a right is something that is inalienable, meaning that force can't take it from you

23
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,180
without killing you. This is why, for example, you have a right to free speech. If you're

24
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,940
standing on public property and saying whatever you want, people can hate what you're saying,

25
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,860
they can hate you, you might lose your job or something. But the actual physical action

26
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,200
of speaking, they must use violence on you to stop it. That's why a right is something

27
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,720
that is intrinsic to you. If you have a right to healthcare, that means that even if you

28
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,640
can't pay for the healthcare, even if the doctors don't get paid at all by anybody,

29
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,760
if they don't give you healthcare, even if they have a good reason not to, they're

30
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,800
violating your rights. A conception of rights that requires somebody else to take a positive

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,060
action for you means that they have the ability to compel your labor. This is why healthcare

32
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,080
is not a right, but speech is. But okay, Twitter, even though it's not, if you think that

33
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,340
access to your service is an essential human right, let's take a quick look at how you've

34
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,840
treated those rights over the years. In 2019, Twitter declined to confirm if people could

35
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,760
or could not post that transsexualism is a mental disorder. Now that's some pretty

36
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,040
inflammatory language, it's not something that I would say. But we did learn later that

37
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,520
no, posting this kind of language gets you banned. And if Twitter access is an essential

38
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,640
right, I guess transphobes don't have rights. Alright, Twitter has banned users for using

39
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:24,040
Elton John songs in video remixes. A number of Brexit party supporters were banned off

40
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,000
of Twitter. And although researchers say that many of them aren't behaving like genuine

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,160
voters due to posting at high volumes, short intervals and at odd times of the day, it

42
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,120
does turn out that based on its internal tools, Twitter is confident that the accounts flagged

43
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,460
by BuzzFeed news are those of real people in the UK despite their seemingly suspicious

44
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:49,300
activity. Nick Monroe was not allowed to post about threats against New Zealand's Prime

45
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,240
Minister. He was forced to delete his tweet, reporting that the New Zealand Prime Minister

46
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,200
had received a copy of the Christchurch Shooters Manifesto before it happened. Nick Monroe

47
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,780
would later be banned for his other tweets, including one where he says that he likes

48
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:11,780
it when his fans suck his cock. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey admitted to the US House of Representatives

49
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:17,440
in 2018 that they were unfairly filtering 600,000 accounts, but it wasn't politically

50
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,940
motivated. Twitter believes that this random person intends to build a time machine just

51
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,020
so that they can rape women from different time periods. This is a video of Pennsylvania

52
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:33,100
State Representative Brian Sims calling for protesters praying outside of a planned parenthood

53
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,100
to be doxxed. The video and Brian Sims are still allowed on Twitter. A Twitter executive

54
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:44,740
was revealed to be a British Army PSYOPs soldier whose job was to spread disinformation

55
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:51,300
on social media. Gordon McMillan, who joined Twitter in 2013 and is listed as the company's

56
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,980
head of editorial for EMEA, also serves with the 77th Brigade, an outfit formed in 2015

57
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:03,780
to conduct information warfare and develop non-lethal ways of conducting war. On February

58
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:09,220
4, 2020, Twitter decided that its users may not deceptively share synthetic or manipulated

59
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,580
media that are likely to cause harm. In addition, they may label tweets containing synthetic

60
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,700
and manipulated media to help people understand their authenticity and to provide context.

61
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:24,220
This was widely reported on as banning memes, since all of Photoshop falls under this rule.

62
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:29,300
Olinda Hassan, a policy manager at Twitter Trust and Safety, was caught on video stating

63
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,500
that Twitter was trying to get the shitty people to not show up. It's a product thing

64
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,500
that we're working on. Former Twitter employees have been charged with spying for Saudi Arabia

65
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:44,060
by digging into the accounts of the kingdom's critics. Twitter says that Trump's Thugs tweet

66
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:49,940
about Minneapolis protests violated standards by glorifying violence. And of course, I don't

67
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:55,020
think we need to go into the constant back and forth between Twitter and Trump during

68
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,540
the course of his presidency. Twitter is considering subscriptions amid an advertising slump. Subscriptions

69
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,500
to remember an essential right. These are some leaked backend shots from Twitter if

70
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,820
you'll recall from like a year or two ago. And you'll notice these tags placed on some

71
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:15,940
of these Twitter accounts. Permanently suspended, suspended, bounced, protected, bounced, inactive,

72
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:21,740
protected, compromised, trends blacklisted, search blacklisted, read only. Remember, Twitter

73
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,900
told Congress that they didn't blacklist people. And imagine being temporarily suspended, permanently

74
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:34,620
suspended or blacklisted from an essential right. This individual posted, Dear God, who

75
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,420
is the absolute boomer retard running your social media. But before she could post it,

76
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,320
Twitter asked her to revise it. And here's the questionnaire that Twitter forced her

77
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,820
to fill out. Why do you believe you receive this message to revise your tweet? Did your

78
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,340
tweet contain language that recipients of it might find offensive? Do you agree or disagree

79
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,140
with the following statements about your tweet? And strangely enough, which of the

80
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:03,340
following describes your race and ethnicity? Is Twitter saying that the status of this

81
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:09,540
essential right changes based on your race? The account always actions was banned, but

82
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,040
only after Trump retweeted them. They were your generic conservative Twitter account

83
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,060
where they posted videos of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protests getting violent. The White

84
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,180
House press secretary had her access to Twitter revoked when she posted about the Hunter Biden

85
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,500
email leaks back before the election. Twitter said that they don't permit the use of their

86
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,740
service to directly distribute content obtained through hacking that contains private information

87
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,180
may put people in physical harm or danger or contains trade secrets. Of course, this

88
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,220
wasn't applied evenly when it came to stuff like the Trump piss dossier a few years ago.

89
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,420
And of course, there's the fact that currently right now on Twitter, people are talking about

90
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:51,040
memes from Hunter Biden's laptop, which are surely leaked or hacked materials. But no

91
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,860
one cares anymore. The editor at the New York Post, one of the nation's largest papers

92
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:01,480
by circulation, was not allowed by Twitter to post one of their own stories that details

93
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,120
corruption by a major party presidential candidate, Joe Biden. Other accounts that posted that

94
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,440
article were also banned. Twitter considers US government websites to be unsafe. Bill

95
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,920
Cosby convicted for rape is still on Twitter. Twitter is developing an anti troll feature

96
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,320
called Safety Mode. It will automatically block accounts that are spammy, use insults,

97
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:27,620
strong language or hateful remarks. Vijaya Gadd, Jack's shield from Tim Pool during the

98
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,600
Joe Rogan podcast, has stated that Twitter has plans for political censorship on a global

99
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,920
scale. The National Archives, which creates copies of everything that a president says

100
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,200
publicly, has requested Twitter for an archive of Donald Trump's Twitter account. Twitter

101
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,140
has refused. Twitter once banned everyone who said the word Memphis on their platform.

102
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,480
Ramzan Kadriov, the Chechen leader who rounded up gay people and tortured and murdered them

103
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,700
in concentration camps, is still allowed on Twitter. The leader of the Islamic Republic

104
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:04,020
of Iran has openly called for genocide against the Jews on Twitter. Erdogan, the leader of

105
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:09,400
Turkey, announced his own ethnic cleansing on Twitter. Meanwhile, shitposting hero The

106
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:15,080
Hindu-Dindu, Brick, was banned for tweeting, Don't like being banned Twitter? Make your

107
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:21,000
own Uganda? Twitter has openly stated that they will ban people for tweeting at somebody

108
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,920
without their permission, and Twitter's terms of service directly state that you may

109
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:33,320
be banned for no reason at all. Even as other websites rise and fall, YTMND is dead, Newgrounds

110
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,540
is a shadow of its former self, most abandonware sites are gone, and GOG didn't really pick

111
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,560
up the slack. All of those random Japanese GeoCities sites with obscure information about

112
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,560
niche manga or games or anime disappeared into the bowels of the internet. But, like

113
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,680
plastic in the ocean, Twitter will be here forever. And it's a good thing! After all,

114
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,880
it's an essential human right. However, I think it's really important to notice exactly

115
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,020
who Twitter is extending this essential human right to. Which people are banned for minor

116
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:08,020
infractions or literally nothing sometimes? Which people can do the most heinous things

117
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,220
on and off platform, and yet their essential human right of access to this service is respected

118
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,900
no matter what? Answer that question and you will discover what type of human Twitter

119
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,540
considers to have rights. Ah shit, I forgot the most important one. You could do anything

120
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,580
on 2007 to 2012 Twitter. I showed people how to cut crack in the microwave and nothing

121
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:30,300
happened. Now I can't even call a fat bitch fat. Alright my friends, thanks for watching.

122
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,700
Yes, this video was a bit more low effort than the last, but I did want to get something

123
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,580
out today. I've spent the majority of my time preparing for the E3 stream happening

124
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,500
shortly. Shortly at least if you're watching this video on release. If you are, hit up

125
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,540
that Twitch channel in the pinned comment, and I'll see you soon. Alright guys, I'll

126
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,820
see you there at the stream. Thanks very much. Have a good one, and I love you.
