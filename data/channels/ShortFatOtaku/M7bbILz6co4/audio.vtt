00:00.000 --> 00:25.240
Oh, what's this, Jack? Why is everyone mad at you? Why do you get heckled wherever you

00:25.240 --> 00:29.740
go? And you know what? It's not just the hecklers. It seems like the world's governments

00:29.780 --> 00:36.740
are finally taking notice of Twitter. India to Twitter. Comply with IT rules or face unintended

00:36.740 --> 00:41.340
consequences. India's new rules, which were announced in February and which became effective

00:41.340 --> 00:46.200
at the end of last month, are aimed at regulating content on social media and making firms such

00:46.200 --> 00:52.300
as Facebook, its WhatsApp messenger, and Twitter more accountable to legal requests. They also

00:52.300 --> 00:57.420
require big social media companies to set up grievance redressal mechanisms and appoint

00:57.420 --> 01:02.780
new executives to coordinate with law enforcement. Back at the start of the year, Uganda decided

01:02.780 --> 01:06.100
to take a swing at Twitter too. Ahead of the Ugandan election, we're hearing reports that

01:06.100 --> 01:10.660
the internet service providers are being ordered to block social media and messaging apps.

01:10.660 --> 01:15.940
We strongly condemn internet shutdowns. They are hugely harmful, violate basic human rights

01:15.940 --> 01:19.980
and the principles of the open internet. Oh, internet access and social media is a human

01:19.980 --> 01:24.740
right now. In fact, take that even further. When Nigeria decided to ban Twitter a few

01:24.740 --> 01:29.600
days ago, nationwide, Twitter had a similar response. We are deeply concerned by the blocking

01:29.600 --> 01:34.180
of Twitter in Nigeria. Access to the free and open internet is an essential human right

01:34.180 --> 01:39.180
in modern society. We will work to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on

01:39.180 --> 01:43.260
Twitter to communicate and connect with the world. Now, I'm not here to simp for Nigeria

01:43.260 --> 01:49.500
or Uganda or whatever, but an essential human right, eh? This is a topic I did a video on

01:49.500 --> 01:53.380
before, called Health Care is Not a Human Right. And just as a reminder, that video

01:53.380 --> 01:57.540
wasn't actually anti-universal healthcare. I simply pointed out that universal healthcare

01:57.540 --> 02:03.060
is a privilege that rich nations should provide to its population, but it wasn't a right.

02:03.060 --> 02:07.240
Because a right is something that is inalienable, meaning that force can't take it from you

02:07.240 --> 02:11.180
without killing you. This is why, for example, you have a right to free speech. If you're

02:11.180 --> 02:14.940
standing on public property and saying whatever you want, people can hate what you're saying,

02:14.940 --> 02:18.860
they can hate you, you might lose your job or something. But the actual physical action

02:18.860 --> 02:23.200
of speaking, they must use violence on you to stop it. That's why a right is something

02:23.240 --> 02:27.720
that is intrinsic to you. If you have a right to healthcare, that means that even if you

02:27.720 --> 02:32.640
can't pay for the healthcare, even if the doctors don't get paid at all by anybody,

02:32.640 --> 02:35.760
if they don't give you healthcare, even if they have a good reason not to, they're

02:35.760 --> 02:39.800
violating your rights. A conception of rights that requires somebody else to take a positive

02:39.800 --> 02:44.060
action for you means that they have the ability to compel your labor. This is why healthcare

02:44.060 --> 02:49.080
is not a right, but speech is. But okay, Twitter, even though it's not, if you think that

02:49.080 --> 02:53.340
access to your service is an essential human right, let's take a quick look at how you've

02:53.340 --> 02:58.840
treated those rights over the years. In 2019, Twitter declined to confirm if people could

02:58.840 --> 03:03.760
or could not post that transsexualism is a mental disorder. Now that's some pretty

03:03.760 --> 03:08.040
inflammatory language, it's not something that I would say. But we did learn later that

03:08.040 --> 03:12.520
no, posting this kind of language gets you banned. And if Twitter access is an essential

03:12.520 --> 03:17.640
right, I guess transphobes don't have rights. Alright, Twitter has banned users for using

03:17.640 --> 03:24.040
Elton John songs in video remixes. A number of Brexit party supporters were banned off

03:24.040 --> 03:29.000
of Twitter. And although researchers say that many of them aren't behaving like genuine

03:29.000 --> 03:34.160
voters due to posting at high volumes, short intervals and at odd times of the day, it

03:34.160 --> 03:39.120
does turn out that based on its internal tools, Twitter is confident that the accounts flagged

03:39.120 --> 03:44.460
by BuzzFeed news are those of real people in the UK despite their seemingly suspicious

03:44.460 --> 03:49.300
activity. Nick Monroe was not allowed to post about threats against New Zealand's Prime

03:49.300 --> 03:54.240
Minister. He was forced to delete his tweet, reporting that the New Zealand Prime Minister

03:54.240 --> 04:00.200
had received a copy of the Christchurch Shooters Manifesto before it happened. Nick Monroe

04:00.200 --> 04:04.780
would later be banned for his other tweets, including one where he says that he likes

04:04.780 --> 04:11.780
it when his fans suck his cock. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey admitted to the US House of Representatives

04:11.780 --> 04:17.440
in 2018 that they were unfairly filtering 600,000 accounts, but it wasn't politically

04:17.440 --> 04:22.940
motivated. Twitter believes that this random person intends to build a time machine just

04:22.940 --> 04:27.020
so that they can rape women from different time periods. This is a video of Pennsylvania

04:27.020 --> 04:33.100
State Representative Brian Sims calling for protesters praying outside of a planned parenthood

04:33.100 --> 04:38.100
to be doxxed. The video and Brian Sims are still allowed on Twitter. A Twitter executive

04:38.100 --> 04:44.740
was revealed to be a British Army PSYOPs soldier whose job was to spread disinformation

04:44.740 --> 04:51.300
on social media. Gordon McMillan, who joined Twitter in 2013 and is listed as the company's

04:51.300 --> 04:57.980
head of editorial for EMEA, also serves with the 77th Brigade, an outfit formed in 2015

04:57.980 --> 05:03.780
to conduct information warfare and develop non-lethal ways of conducting war. On February

05:03.780 --> 05:09.220
4, 2020, Twitter decided that its users may not deceptively share synthetic or manipulated

05:09.220 --> 05:14.580
media that are likely to cause harm. In addition, they may label tweets containing synthetic

05:14.580 --> 05:18.700
and manipulated media to help people understand their authenticity and to provide context.

05:18.700 --> 05:24.220
This was widely reported on as banning memes, since all of Photoshop falls under this rule.

05:24.220 --> 05:29.300
Olinda Hassan, a policy manager at Twitter Trust and Safety, was caught on video stating

05:29.300 --> 05:33.500
that Twitter was trying to get the shitty people to not show up. It's a product thing

05:33.540 --> 05:38.500
that we're working on. Former Twitter employees have been charged with spying for Saudi Arabia

05:38.500 --> 05:44.060
by digging into the accounts of the kingdom's critics. Twitter says that Trump's Thugs tweet

05:44.060 --> 05:49.940
about Minneapolis protests violated standards by glorifying violence. And of course, I don't

05:49.940 --> 05:55.020
think we need to go into the constant back and forth between Twitter and Trump during

05:55.020 --> 06:00.540
the course of his presidency. Twitter is considering subscriptions amid an advertising slump. Subscriptions

06:00.540 --> 06:05.500
to remember an essential right. These are some leaked backend shots from Twitter if

06:05.500 --> 06:09.820
you'll recall from like a year or two ago. And you'll notice these tags placed on some

06:09.820 --> 06:15.940
of these Twitter accounts. Permanently suspended, suspended, bounced, protected, bounced, inactive,

06:15.940 --> 06:21.740
protected, compromised, trends blacklisted, search blacklisted, read only. Remember, Twitter

06:21.740 --> 06:27.900
told Congress that they didn't blacklist people. And imagine being temporarily suspended, permanently

06:27.900 --> 06:34.620
suspended or blacklisted from an essential right. This individual posted, Dear God, who

06:34.620 --> 06:40.420
is the absolute boomer retard running your social media. But before she could post it,

06:40.420 --> 06:44.320
Twitter asked her to revise it. And here's the questionnaire that Twitter forced her

06:44.320 --> 06:48.820
to fill out. Why do you believe you receive this message to revise your tweet? Did your

06:48.820 --> 06:53.340
tweet contain language that recipients of it might find offensive? Do you agree or disagree

06:53.340 --> 06:58.140
with the following statements about your tweet? And strangely enough, which of the

06:58.140 --> 07:03.340
following describes your race and ethnicity? Is Twitter saying that the status of this

07:03.340 --> 07:09.540
essential right changes based on your race? The account always actions was banned, but

07:09.540 --> 07:14.040
only after Trump retweeted them. They were your generic conservative Twitter account

07:14.040 --> 07:18.060
where they posted videos of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protests getting violent. The White

07:18.060 --> 07:23.180
House press secretary had her access to Twitter revoked when she posted about the Hunter Biden

07:23.180 --> 07:27.500
email leaks back before the election. Twitter said that they don't permit the use of their

07:27.500 --> 07:32.740
service to directly distribute content obtained through hacking that contains private information

07:32.740 --> 07:37.180
may put people in physical harm or danger or contains trade secrets. Of course, this

07:37.180 --> 07:41.220
wasn't applied evenly when it came to stuff like the Trump piss dossier a few years ago.

07:41.220 --> 07:45.420
And of course, there's the fact that currently right now on Twitter, people are talking about

07:45.420 --> 07:51.040
memes from Hunter Biden's laptop, which are surely leaked or hacked materials. But no

07:51.040 --> 07:55.860
one cares anymore. The editor at the New York Post, one of the nation's largest papers

07:55.860 --> 08:01.480
by circulation, was not allowed by Twitter to post one of their own stories that details

08:01.480 --> 08:06.120
corruption by a major party presidential candidate, Joe Biden. Other accounts that posted that

08:06.120 --> 08:12.440
article were also banned. Twitter considers US government websites to be unsafe. Bill

08:12.440 --> 08:17.920
Cosby convicted for rape is still on Twitter. Twitter is developing an anti troll feature

08:17.920 --> 08:22.320
called Safety Mode. It will automatically block accounts that are spammy, use insults,

08:22.320 --> 08:27.620
strong language or hateful remarks. Vijaya Gadd, Jack's shield from Tim Pool during the

08:27.620 --> 08:32.600
Joe Rogan podcast, has stated that Twitter has plans for political censorship on a global

08:32.600 --> 08:36.920
scale. The National Archives, which creates copies of everything that a president says

08:36.920 --> 08:41.200
publicly, has requested Twitter for an archive of Donald Trump's Twitter account. Twitter

08:41.200 --> 08:47.140
has refused. Twitter once banned everyone who said the word Memphis on their platform.

08:47.140 --> 08:52.480
Ramzan Kadriov, the Chechen leader who rounded up gay people and tortured and murdered them

08:52.480 --> 08:57.700
in concentration camps, is still allowed on Twitter. The leader of the Islamic Republic

08:57.700 --> 09:04.020
of Iran has openly called for genocide against the Jews on Twitter. Erdogan, the leader of

09:04.020 --> 09:09.400
Turkey, announced his own ethnic cleansing on Twitter. Meanwhile, shitposting hero The

09:09.400 --> 09:15.080
Hindu-Dindu, Brick, was banned for tweeting, Don't like being banned Twitter? Make your

09:15.080 --> 09:21.000
own Uganda? Twitter has openly stated that they will ban people for tweeting at somebody

09:21.000 --> 09:25.920
without their permission, and Twitter's terms of service directly state that you may

09:25.920 --> 09:33.320
be banned for no reason at all. Even as other websites rise and fall, YTMND is dead, Newgrounds

09:33.320 --> 09:38.540
is a shadow of its former self, most abandonware sites are gone, and GOG didn't really pick

09:38.540 --> 09:43.560
up the slack. All of those random Japanese GeoCities sites with obscure information about

09:43.560 --> 09:48.560
niche manga or games or anime disappeared into the bowels of the internet. But, like

09:48.560 --> 09:53.680
plastic in the ocean, Twitter will be here forever. And it's a good thing! After all,

09:53.680 --> 09:57.880
it's an essential human right. However, I think it's really important to notice exactly

09:57.880 --> 10:03.020
who Twitter is extending this essential human right to. Which people are banned for minor

10:03.020 --> 10:08.020
infractions or literally nothing sometimes? Which people can do the most heinous things

10:08.020 --> 10:13.220
on and off platform, and yet their essential human right of access to this service is respected

10:13.220 --> 10:17.900
no matter what? Answer that question and you will discover what type of human Twitter

10:17.900 --> 10:21.540
considers to have rights. Ah shit, I forgot the most important one. You could do anything

10:21.540 --> 10:25.580
on 2007 to 2012 Twitter. I showed people how to cut crack in the microwave and nothing

10:25.580 --> 10:30.300
happened. Now I can't even call a fat bitch fat. Alright my friends, thanks for watching.

10:30.300 --> 10:33.700
Yes, this video was a bit more low effort than the last, but I did want to get something

10:33.700 --> 10:38.580
out today. I've spent the majority of my time preparing for the E3 stream happening

10:38.580 --> 10:42.500
shortly. Shortly at least if you're watching this video on release. If you are, hit up

10:42.500 --> 10:46.540
that Twitch channel in the pinned comment, and I'll see you soon. Alright guys, I'll

10:46.540 --> 10:49.820
see you there at the stream. Thanks very much. Have a good one, and I love you.
