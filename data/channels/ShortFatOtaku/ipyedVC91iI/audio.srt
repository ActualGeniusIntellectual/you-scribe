1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,460
It's finally time, guys. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna say the word describing something

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:15,080
so toxic, it must be opposed in all of its forms. The word referring to a people and

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,640
how they are different from others around them. The word whose underlying ideas are

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,060
a relic of the past. Once accepted in all of its glory, but today must be violently

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:29,080
cast aside for the march of progress to continue. It is now time to say that dreaded word.

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,960
N- N- NATIONALISM

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,860
Nationalism refers to the individual's identification with their nation and support for the interests

8
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:44,020
of that nation, sometimes but not always leading to the exclusion or detriment of the interests

9
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,200
or individuals of other nations. Following that, a nation is a large body of people united

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,080
by common ancestry, history, culture, language or some other factor, generally inhabiting

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,340
a particular country or territory. Nowadays, we have a tendency to use the word nation

12
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,560
to refer to an organized political community under the control of a government, but that's

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,900
actually what a state is. In today's colloquial speech, nation and state are used interchangeably.

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,680
This came about due to the early 1900s preference for the concept of the nation state. A nation

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,840
state is a political organization where the nation, the people of some common ethnicity

16
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,480
in a common location, and the state, the government with the jurisdiction over that location,

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,960
are congruent. Political science of the time advocated for nation state building as a way

18
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,240
to maximize freedom and prosperity, as opposed to imperialism, where multiple nations paid

19
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,200
a central imperial authority to fund their own oppression, or colonialism, where a ruling

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,660
nation would forcibly convert the people of a rival nation to their own. Common examples

21
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,700
of the nation state are Israel and Japan, where the populations of the state of Israel

22
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,120
and the state of Japan are overwhelmingly ethnically Jewish and Japanese respectively.

23
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,580
Nations and progressive movements are generally anti-nationalist. They view their goals as

24
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,160
being fundamentally globalist, and with good reason. Trade and diplomacy are international

25
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,320
endeavors, generally with huge benefits to the people involved, and an insular world

26
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,560
view can hamper those efforts. At the same time, there's also a solid moral argument

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,780
to be made. If there's an ethnic cleansing happening somewhere, it doesn't sound convincing

28
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,840
to simply ignore it because it's happening in somebody else's backyard. The obvious problem

29
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,620
though is when a state begins to ignore domestic issues in favor of foreign ones, where the

30
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,000
international takes precedence over the national. Nationalism as an ideology is linked to fascism.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,240
This is often correct. The fascists of many countries, most notably Nazi Germany, appealed

32
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,240
to ethnicity and ethnic nationalism as justification for their wars of expansion, ethnic cleansings,

33
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,300
and totality of state control of the whole society. The Nazis believed that because the

34
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,500
ethnic German people were scattered across multiple different states in Europe, Nazi

35
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,200
Germany had a moral obligation to unite them under one state. One people, one language,

36
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,820
one Reich. Ernst Renan gave his famous lecture, What is a Nation?, in 1882, where he described

37
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,380
multiple problems with the ethnic idea of nationhood. He first notices that large empires

38
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,940
like Egypt, Rome, and China were in fact not nations, but were multi-ethnic empires,

39
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,500
with varying levels of stability and integration across time. From this we can see that, although

40
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,380
nation states do exist, it is not a requirement that a state map onto an ethnicity for that

41
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,940
Renan brings up the great Germanic invasion of France in the 5th century, lasting until

42
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,660
the 10th century Norman conquests, and how it caused an entirely forgotten change in

43
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:32,020
the Frankish Empire. Renan states, France became quite legitimately the name of a country

44
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,140
to which only a virtually imperceptible minority of Franks had come. The idea that the population

45
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,260
of France was composed of different races was in no way apparent to French writers.

46
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,220
The difference between noble and serf was as sharply drawn as possible, but it was in

47
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,180
no sense presented as an ethnic difference. It was presented rather as a difference in

48
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,940
courage, customs, and education. It did not occur to anyone that the origin of all of

49
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:01,220
this was a conquest. After one or two generations, the Norman invaders no longer distinguished

50
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,580
themselves from the rest of the population, although their influence was not any less

51
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,740
profound because of this fact. They had given the conquered country a nobility, military

52
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,820
habits, and a patriotism that they had not known before. In other words, even though

53
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,300
the invaders of France had settled there and had become the new rulers of that land, they

54
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,540
nonetheless adopted some French customs, just as the French had adopted some of theirs.

55
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,340
And although a sophisticated genetic analysis of the lords and the serfs, if one had existed,

56
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,660
may have revealed two entirely different ethnic groups, nobody alive at that time saw themselves

57
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,620
as anything other than a unified French people. In fact, as Renan goes on to clarify, the

58
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,780
unity of the French people required not only the creation of a common national story that

59
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,820
they could tell each other, but the forgetting of certain facts that could threaten that

60
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,820
unity.

61
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,380
The union of northern France with the media was the result of massacres and terror lasting

62
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,940
for the best part of a century. No French citizen knows whether he is a Burgundian,

63
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:00,680
an Allen, a Taifal, or a Visigoth, yet every French citizen has to have forgotten the massacre

64
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,980
of Saint Bartholomew, or the massacres that took place in the media in the 13th century.

65
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:11,100
You might see it as ahistorical or anti-intellectual or something, to forget a part of history,

66
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,500
especially something as key as a massacre. But on some level, everybody has grievance

67
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,120
with everybody else, and to live in a civil society, you must eventually forget.

68
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,380
Nobody today views France as a series of ethnic groups that fought bloody wars between north,

69
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,580
central, and southern France, and that they're somehow all united in a tenuous alliance,

70
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,780
just waiting for the republic to collapse. No, we all see them as French, they see themselves

71
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,380
as French. They have forgotten those battles, and those massacres, and those conquests.

72
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,740
Brennan also takes aim at the idea that language should be some universal unifying factor.

73
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,940
To that, he says, nothing could be more false. Prussia, where only German is now spoken,

74
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:53,540
spoke Slav a few centuries ago. In Wales, English is spoken. Gaul and Spain speak the

75
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:59,140
same primitive dialects of Alba Longa. Egypt speaks Arabic. Slaves often speak the same

76
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,460
language as their masters, but are often enough a different race to that of their masters.

77
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,440
The point here is that race and language can be the basis for a nation, but it is not the basis

78
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,060
to force a nation where one is not wanted by that population. Renan offers several examples of this

79
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:20,620
in action. In our own day, the day of 1882, we have seen Italy unified through its defeats,

80
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,780
and the Ottoman Empire destroyed by its victories. Each defeat advanced the cause of Italy,

81
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,940
each victory spelled doom for the Ottomans. For Italy is a nation, and the Ottomans,

82
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,660
outside of the Turks and Asia Minor, is not one. How is it that Switzerland, which has three

83
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,580
languages, two religions, and three or four races, is a nation, while Tuscany, which is so

84
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,980
homogenous, is not one? Switzerland, being of Germanic origin but spending most of its history

85
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:51,140
as explicitly anti-German, brings us back to the Nazi desire to unify all ethnic Germans under one

86
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,620
state. Renan predicts their attempts to do so 50 years before by understanding the logical outcome

87
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,420
of ethnic nationalism. The Germanic family, according to the theory I am expounding here,

88
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:06,500
has the right to reassemble the scattered limbs of the Germanic order, even when these limbs are

89
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,180
not asking to be joined together again. This is where we get the liberal answer to nationalism,

90
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:17,180
civic nationalism. It's the idea that a nation is not based on a race or an ethnicity or a language

91
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,860
or a historic location, but rather on the shared liberal values, principles, and a willingness to

92
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,180
uphold those political institutions. This idea is, in my opinion, one of the greatest French

93
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,100
contributions to the liberal tradition. The English liberals have a lot going for them,

94
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,340
don't get me wrong. They started the tradition, and I think Locke is their greatest writer,

95
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,260
but in my opinion it would have been a lot harder for the English to come up with civic nationalism,

96
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,780
mainly because the differences in their political structures. As we talked about earlier,

97
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,420
nationalism relies, on some level, on the ability to forget past slights. To say that those battles,

98
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,940
those massacres, those atrocities were in the past, done by different individuals, and for

99
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,780
better or worse we're unified now. A state of affairs that people on all sides must voluntarily

100
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,940
come to if that nation is to survive. But the civil structures of Great Britain, of Canada,

101
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,500
of the United States, are not nation states, but instead are multinational unions. The British are

102
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,380
not some homogenizing union of Britons, forgetting about the existence of England, Scotland, and

103
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,100
Wales. They are a political union of distinct nations, each with their own national pride.

104
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,620
The United States is not a state, it is 50 states, an alliance for a common cause. Canada

105
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,960
rests atop a delicate balance of English and French ethnic interests, agreed upon to end a

106
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,980
war. It's Renan who first understood that lasting peace only comes when people forget their pasts,

107
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:38,580
and in doing so, forget the reasons to oppose their neighbors. If you're an English liberal

108
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,860
getting mad at me talking about this, don't worry about it. Most of the rest of French

109
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,700
philosophy is garbage, you're fine. However, the progressive and the socialist reject nationalism

110
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,980
in all of its forms, both ethnic and civil, and in doing so, rejects the open liberal democratic

111
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,820
society. They understand that a society is destroyed by ethnic tension, and so the civic

112
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:03,180
national prescription of letting bygones be bygones has to be suppressed. This is why racial

113
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,420
agitators exist. People who seek to constantly dredge up the history of slavery in the United

114
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,140
States hundreds of years later, or those professional victims who divide people into

115
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,780
oppressed and oppressor classes in order to sow disunity. Let's be clear though, unity is not

116
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,820
the greatest value. There is certainly a time and place for disunity. Let's say one person murders

117
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,980
another. Before the blood is cold is not the time to say, hey, let bygones be bygones. Let's all

118
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,180
forget this happened to move on in a civil way. If the perpetrator of a crime still lives, then

119
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,100
there still exists a moral duty to see his debt to society paid. If the victims are gone and the

120
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,260
perpetrators are gone, then what good is there in dredging up the past? What does it do other

121
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,180
than create more problems? This is why that multi-ethnic griller meme is so wholesome. They

122
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,820
know what their ancestors did was wrong, but that shouldn't stop civil society from moving forward

123
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,460
for everybody's benefit. The progressive rejects civic nationalism out of ignorance. They see the

124
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,620
American flag, the Canadian flag, the British flag, whatever it is, and scream fascist because

125
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,020
they believe that nationalism can only be ethnic, and therefore any symbol of nationalism can only

126
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:09,380
refer to ethnic supremacy. Of course, they're wrong. These flags don't represent a race or

127
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:15,060
a religion. They represent a shared compact to uphold the civic values of these places. And yes,

128
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,700
to exclude those who refuse to uphold them. The socialist rejects civic nationalism because civic

129
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,900
nationalism represents one of the greatest threats to the socialist project. Renan finishes his

130
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,420
lecture by saying, man is everything in the formation of this sacred thing which is called

131
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,220
a people. Nothing purely material suffices for it. A nation is a spiritual principle,

132
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,060
the outcome of the profound complications of history. Two things which in truth are but one,

133
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:44,980
constitute this soul or spiritual principle. One lies in the past, one in the present. One is the

134
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,300
possession in common of a rich legacy of memories. The other is the present-day consent, the desire

135
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,120
to live together, the will to perpetuate the value of the heritage that one has received. Man is a

136
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,560
slave neither of his race nor his language, nor of his religion, nor of the course of rivers,

137
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,120
nor the direction taken by mountain chains. A large aggregate of men, healthy in mind and warm

138
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,360
of heart, creates the kind of moral conscience which we call a nation. A nation is a non-material

139
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,640
thing that nonetheless exists as long as people believe in it. If the group of people who

140
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:22,320
constitute a nation say, yes, these are my values, then that nation exists. And it's just as real as

141
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,400
anything else. And the socialist, in aiming for a worldwide workers revolution in totality,

142
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:33,320
must fundamentally be anti every nation. Or to be more precise, must work to craft an entirely

143
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,040
different narrative for people to believe in. The narrative of the revolutionary working class.

144
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,720
Which is confusing to me because even as these people reject nationalism as being inherently

145
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,160
fascist, even though it's not, they're ultimately still hyper nationalistic when it comes to

146
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,640
indigenous rights in Europe colonized countries. Despite their outward hatred of nationalism,

147
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,880
when it comes to the status of say indigenous reservations, land claims, racial tensions,

148
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,920
they suddenly revert to a level of blood and soil rhetoric that would make a Nazi blush. I thought

149
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,480
progress was moving past the idea that ancestral ties to specific tracts of land gave those with

150
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,800
the blood of a chosen race unique, exclusive and spiritual claims to that land. And yet these

151
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,520
people are happy to jump backwards as soon as the claimant has brown skin. For those of you who

152
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,320
don't know, Canada is responsible for the residential school system. I talked about it in

153
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,880
my Canada 150 video, but that was like four years ago. As the history goes, the government of Canada

154
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,880
and the Catholic Church ran a series of schools, the residential schools, for indigenous children.

155
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,880
In 1969, many of the schools were closed, and the ones that stayed open underwent some much needed

156
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:41,680
reforms. By 1996, the final school had closed. From the 1880s, up until that reformation point

157
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,640
in 1969, the residential schools carried out an ethnic cleansing of the indigenous population

158
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,480
of Canada. Indigenous children were taken from their parents and placed into these schools where

159
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,080
they could be reeducated to think, speak and act European. Additionally, there is solid evidence

160
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,240
of rampant physical and sexual abuse of the children at these schools. Around the same time,

161
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,480
the USA was enshrining the national rights of its indigenous populations as recognized ethnic

162
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,000
nations within their multinational union. Canada would not do the same until 1985. About a month

163
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,280
and a half ago, a mass burial site was discovered at the location of several of Canada's residential

164
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,920
schools. It was initially reported that the bodies of 215 native children were discovered,

165
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:27,320
but that number has since risen to, the last I checked, 1,505. This isn't quite like American

166
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,400
slavery, where both the slaves and the slave masters have been dead for over a century,

167
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,600
and so those people who are complaining about it today have no idea what they're talking about.

168
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,840
There are victims alive today who suffered under the system. Some people say we shouldn't celebrate

169
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,480
Canada Day today since this drama is unfolding right now, and it's a pretty huge stain on the

170
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,760
national identity. Fair enough. Those same people would rather see a commemoration of those dead

171
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,040
kids. I can understand that. I'm assuming you're probably an American listening to this right now,

172
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,660
based on the demographics that YouTube gives me. For you, this would be like, say in May,

173
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:05,720
somebody discovers a new mass grave of black slaves in the south somewhere, and as a result

174
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,240
of this discovery, activists in your country are demanding that July 4th this year be cancelled.

175
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,800
Would you agree with that? I don't know. I understand their anger, especially the still

176
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,280
living survivors. At the very least, they clearly deserve a big fat cheque from the Canadian

177
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,960
government. But does that mean I want Canada and all of its legitimately good things to vanish?

178
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,520
Would that help anybody? Surely we're capable of reckoning with the past while still celebrating

179
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,640
the actual good we've done, and there's a lot of it. Surely that is the spirit of civic nationalism.

180
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,640
We don't need to simply say fuck it and draw racial lines, but we also don't need to throw

181
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,240
the baby out with the bathwater, simply because nationalism bad socialism good.

182
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,480
Renan correctly said that a functioning nationalism requires moving beyond past

183
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,360
atrocities, not getting mired in the hatred that the people who came before you held.

184
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,640
But there's also a practical reality that you cannot use that principle to prevent justice

185
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,460
from being served. I understand that because of the recent discoveries here in Canada,

186
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:03,240
leftists want Canada Day cancelled. But you know what? Leftists have been clamoring for Canada Day

187
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,600
to be cancelled for decades now. They're using the legitimacy of a recent event to bolster their

188
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,680
voice. And the truth is, if Canada Day is cancelled this year for this reason, then

189
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,320
they will cancel it every year for this reason, because their goal is ultimately to destroy civic

190
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,040
nationalism. They're anti liberal, and that for me is reason enough to oppose them. I recognize all

191
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,240
the bad that my country has done. I recognize that there are still things we can do today to

192
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:33,440
right those wrongs. And in that spirit explicitly, I am celebrating Canada Day today. Thanks for

193
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,800
listening, guys. I hope you enjoyed the video. Speaking of Canada Day, I will be doing a Canada

194
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,920
Day stream tonight. Me and my friends are going to play the indie game Death Road to Canada. We

195
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,480
play it every year on July 1st on Twitch. Not going to be talking about politics tonight. We're

196
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,680
going to be hanging out talking with the chat and having a good time. So please consider dropping

197
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,240
by twitch.tv slash game boomers. I'll see you there. Thanks very much for listening. I love you
