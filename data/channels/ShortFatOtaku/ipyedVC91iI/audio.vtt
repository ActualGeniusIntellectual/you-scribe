00:00.000 --> 00:09.460
It's finally time, guys. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna say the word describing something

00:09.460 --> 00:15.080
so toxic, it must be opposed in all of its forms. The word referring to a people and

00:15.080 --> 00:18.640
how they are different from others around them. The word whose underlying ideas are

00:18.640 --> 00:23.060
a relic of the past. Once accepted in all of its glory, but today must be violently

00:23.060 --> 00:29.080
cast aside for the march of progress to continue. It is now time to say that dreaded word.

00:29.080 --> 00:33.960
N- N- NATIONALISM

00:33.960 --> 00:38.860
Nationalism refers to the individual's identification with their nation and support for the interests

00:38.860 --> 00:44.020
of that nation, sometimes but not always leading to the exclusion or detriment of the interests

00:44.020 --> 00:49.200
or individuals of other nations. Following that, a nation is a large body of people united

00:49.200 --> 00:55.080
by common ancestry, history, culture, language or some other factor, generally inhabiting

00:55.080 --> 00:59.340
a particular country or territory. Nowadays, we have a tendency to use the word nation

00:59.340 --> 01:03.560
to refer to an organized political community under the control of a government, but that's

01:03.560 --> 01:08.900
actually what a state is. In today's colloquial speech, nation and state are used interchangeably.

01:08.900 --> 01:13.680
This came about due to the early 1900s preference for the concept of the nation state. A nation

01:13.680 --> 01:17.840
state is a political organization where the nation, the people of some common ethnicity

01:17.840 --> 01:23.480
in a common location, and the state, the government with the jurisdiction over that location,

01:23.480 --> 01:27.960
are congruent. Political science of the time advocated for nation state building as a way

01:27.960 --> 01:33.240
to maximize freedom and prosperity, as opposed to imperialism, where multiple nations paid

01:33.240 --> 01:38.200
a central imperial authority to fund their own oppression, or colonialism, where a ruling

01:38.200 --> 01:42.660
nation would forcibly convert the people of a rival nation to their own. Common examples

01:42.660 --> 01:46.700
of the nation state are Israel and Japan, where the populations of the state of Israel

01:46.700 --> 01:52.120
and the state of Japan are overwhelmingly ethnically Jewish and Japanese respectively.

01:52.120 --> 01:56.580
Nations and progressive movements are generally anti-nationalist. They view their goals as

01:56.580 --> 02:01.160
being fundamentally globalist, and with good reason. Trade and diplomacy are international

02:01.160 --> 02:05.320
endeavors, generally with huge benefits to the people involved, and an insular world

02:05.320 --> 02:09.560
view can hamper those efforts. At the same time, there's also a solid moral argument

02:09.560 --> 02:13.780
to be made. If there's an ethnic cleansing happening somewhere, it doesn't sound convincing

02:13.780 --> 02:17.840
to simply ignore it because it's happening in somebody else's backyard. The obvious problem

02:17.840 --> 02:22.620
though is when a state begins to ignore domestic issues in favor of foreign ones, where the

02:22.620 --> 02:28.000
international takes precedence over the national. Nationalism as an ideology is linked to fascism.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.240
This is often correct. The fascists of many countries, most notably Nazi Germany, appealed

02:32.240 --> 02:38.240
to ethnicity and ethnic nationalism as justification for their wars of expansion, ethnic cleansings,

02:38.240 --> 02:42.300
and totality of state control of the whole society. The Nazis believed that because the

02:42.300 --> 02:46.500
ethnic German people were scattered across multiple different states in Europe, Nazi

02:46.500 --> 02:51.200
Germany had a moral obligation to unite them under one state. One people, one language,

02:51.200 --> 02:56.820
one Reich. Ernst Renan gave his famous lecture, What is a Nation?, in 1882, where he described

02:56.820 --> 03:01.380
multiple problems with the ethnic idea of nationhood. He first notices that large empires

03:01.380 --> 03:06.940
like Egypt, Rome, and China were in fact not nations, but were multi-ethnic empires,

03:06.940 --> 03:11.500
with varying levels of stability and integration across time. From this we can see that, although

03:11.500 --> 03:16.380
nation states do exist, it is not a requirement that a state map onto an ethnicity for that

03:17.260 --> 03:21.940
Renan brings up the great Germanic invasion of France in the 5th century, lasting until

03:21.940 --> 03:26.660
the 10th century Norman conquests, and how it caused an entirely forgotten change in

03:26.660 --> 03:32.020
the Frankish Empire. Renan states, France became quite legitimately the name of a country

03:32.020 --> 03:37.140
to which only a virtually imperceptible minority of Franks had come. The idea that the population

03:37.140 --> 03:42.260
of France was composed of different races was in no way apparent to French writers.

03:42.260 --> 03:47.220
The difference between noble and serf was as sharply drawn as possible, but it was in

03:47.220 --> 03:51.180
no sense presented as an ethnic difference. It was presented rather as a difference in

03:51.180 --> 03:55.940
courage, customs, and education. It did not occur to anyone that the origin of all of

03:55.940 --> 04:01.220
this was a conquest. After one or two generations, the Norman invaders no longer distinguished

04:01.220 --> 04:04.580
themselves from the rest of the population, although their influence was not any less

04:04.580 --> 04:08.740
profound because of this fact. They had given the conquered country a nobility, military

04:08.740 --> 04:12.820
habits, and a patriotism that they had not known before. In other words, even though

04:12.820 --> 04:17.300
the invaders of France had settled there and had become the new rulers of that land, they

04:17.300 --> 04:21.540
nonetheless adopted some French customs, just as the French had adopted some of theirs.

04:21.540 --> 04:26.340
And although a sophisticated genetic analysis of the lords and the serfs, if one had existed,

04:26.340 --> 04:31.660
may have revealed two entirely different ethnic groups, nobody alive at that time saw themselves

04:31.660 --> 04:36.620
as anything other than a unified French people. In fact, as Renan goes on to clarify, the

04:36.620 --> 04:40.780
unity of the French people required not only the creation of a common national story that

04:40.780 --> 04:44.820
they could tell each other, but the forgetting of certain facts that could threaten that

04:44.820 --> 04:45.820
unity.

04:45.820 --> 04:50.380
The union of northern France with the media was the result of massacres and terror lasting

04:50.380 --> 04:54.940
for the best part of a century. No French citizen knows whether he is a Burgundian,

04:54.940 --> 05:00.680
an Allen, a Taifal, or a Visigoth, yet every French citizen has to have forgotten the massacre

05:00.680 --> 05:04.980
of Saint Bartholomew, or the massacres that took place in the media in the 13th century.

05:04.980 --> 05:11.100
You might see it as ahistorical or anti-intellectual or something, to forget a part of history,

05:11.100 --> 05:15.500
especially something as key as a massacre. But on some level, everybody has grievance

05:15.500 --> 05:20.120
with everybody else, and to live in a civil society, you must eventually forget.

05:20.120 --> 05:24.380
Nobody today views France as a series of ethnic groups that fought bloody wars between north,

05:24.380 --> 05:28.580
central, and southern France, and that they're somehow all united in a tenuous alliance,

05:28.580 --> 05:32.780
just waiting for the republic to collapse. No, we all see them as French, they see themselves

05:32.780 --> 05:37.380
as French. They have forgotten those battles, and those massacres, and those conquests.

05:37.380 --> 05:42.740
Brennan also takes aim at the idea that language should be some universal unifying factor.

05:42.740 --> 05:47.940
To that, he says, nothing could be more false. Prussia, where only German is now spoken,

05:47.940 --> 05:53.540
spoke Slav a few centuries ago. In Wales, English is spoken. Gaul and Spain speak the

05:53.540 --> 05:59.140
same primitive dialects of Alba Longa. Egypt speaks Arabic. Slaves often speak the same

05:59.140 --> 06:03.460
language as their masters, but are often enough a different race to that of their masters.

06:03.460 --> 06:09.440
The point here is that race and language can be the basis for a nation, but it is not the basis

06:09.440 --> 06:14.060
to force a nation where one is not wanted by that population. Renan offers several examples of this

06:14.060 --> 06:20.620
in action. In our own day, the day of 1882, we have seen Italy unified through its defeats,

06:20.620 --> 06:25.780
and the Ottoman Empire destroyed by its victories. Each defeat advanced the cause of Italy,

06:25.780 --> 06:30.940
each victory spelled doom for the Ottomans. For Italy is a nation, and the Ottomans,

06:30.940 --> 06:35.660
outside of the Turks and Asia Minor, is not one. How is it that Switzerland, which has three

06:35.660 --> 06:40.580
languages, two religions, and three or four races, is a nation, while Tuscany, which is so

06:40.580 --> 06:44.980
homogenous, is not one? Switzerland, being of Germanic origin but spending most of its history

06:44.980 --> 06:51.140
as explicitly anti-German, brings us back to the Nazi desire to unify all ethnic Germans under one

06:51.140 --> 06:56.620
state. Renan predicts their attempts to do so 50 years before by understanding the logical outcome

06:56.620 --> 07:01.420
of ethnic nationalism. The Germanic family, according to the theory I am expounding here,

07:01.420 --> 07:06.500
has the right to reassemble the scattered limbs of the Germanic order, even when these limbs are

07:06.500 --> 07:11.180
not asking to be joined together again. This is where we get the liberal answer to nationalism,

07:11.180 --> 07:17.180
civic nationalism. It's the idea that a nation is not based on a race or an ethnicity or a language

07:17.180 --> 07:22.860
or a historic location, but rather on the shared liberal values, principles, and a willingness to

07:22.860 --> 07:28.180
uphold those political institutions. This idea is, in my opinion, one of the greatest French

07:28.180 --> 07:32.100
contributions to the liberal tradition. The English liberals have a lot going for them,

07:32.100 --> 07:36.340
don't get me wrong. They started the tradition, and I think Locke is their greatest writer,

07:36.340 --> 07:40.260
but in my opinion it would have been a lot harder for the English to come up with civic nationalism,

07:40.260 --> 07:43.780
mainly because the differences in their political structures. As we talked about earlier,

07:43.820 --> 07:49.420
nationalism relies, on some level, on the ability to forget past slights. To say that those battles,

07:49.420 --> 07:53.940
those massacres, those atrocities were in the past, done by different individuals, and for

07:53.940 --> 07:58.780
better or worse we're unified now. A state of affairs that people on all sides must voluntarily

07:58.780 --> 08:03.940
come to if that nation is to survive. But the civil structures of Great Britain, of Canada,

08:03.940 --> 08:09.500
of the United States, are not nation states, but instead are multinational unions. The British are

08:09.500 --> 08:14.380
not some homogenizing union of Britons, forgetting about the existence of England, Scotland, and

08:14.380 --> 08:19.100
Wales. They are a political union of distinct nations, each with their own national pride.

08:19.100 --> 08:24.620
The United States is not a state, it is 50 states, an alliance for a common cause. Canada

08:24.620 --> 08:28.960
rests atop a delicate balance of English and French ethnic interests, agreed upon to end a

08:28.960 --> 08:33.980
war. It's Renan who first understood that lasting peace only comes when people forget their pasts,

08:33.980 --> 08:38.580
and in doing so, forget the reasons to oppose their neighbors. If you're an English liberal

08:38.580 --> 08:41.860
getting mad at me talking about this, don't worry about it. Most of the rest of French

08:41.860 --> 08:46.700
philosophy is garbage, you're fine. However, the progressive and the socialist reject nationalism

08:46.700 --> 08:52.980
in all of its forms, both ethnic and civil, and in doing so, rejects the open liberal democratic

08:52.980 --> 08:57.820
society. They understand that a society is destroyed by ethnic tension, and so the civic

08:57.820 --> 09:03.180
national prescription of letting bygones be bygones has to be suppressed. This is why racial

09:03.180 --> 09:07.420
agitators exist. People who seek to constantly dredge up the history of slavery in the United

09:07.460 --> 09:11.140
States hundreds of years later, or those professional victims who divide people into

09:11.140 --> 09:15.780
oppressed and oppressor classes in order to sow disunity. Let's be clear though, unity is not

09:15.780 --> 09:20.820
the greatest value. There is certainly a time and place for disunity. Let's say one person murders

09:20.820 --> 09:25.980
another. Before the blood is cold is not the time to say, hey, let bygones be bygones. Let's all

09:25.980 --> 09:30.180
forget this happened to move on in a civil way. If the perpetrator of a crime still lives, then

09:30.180 --> 09:35.100
there still exists a moral duty to see his debt to society paid. If the victims are gone and the

09:35.100 --> 09:39.260
perpetrators are gone, then what good is there in dredging up the past? What does it do other

09:39.260 --> 09:44.180
than create more problems? This is why that multi-ethnic griller meme is so wholesome. They

09:44.180 --> 09:48.820
know what their ancestors did was wrong, but that shouldn't stop civil society from moving forward

09:48.820 --> 09:53.460
for everybody's benefit. The progressive rejects civic nationalism out of ignorance. They see the

09:53.460 --> 09:58.620
American flag, the Canadian flag, the British flag, whatever it is, and scream fascist because

09:58.620 --> 10:04.020
they believe that nationalism can only be ethnic, and therefore any symbol of nationalism can only

10:04.140 --> 10:09.380
refer to ethnic supremacy. Of course, they're wrong. These flags don't represent a race or

10:09.380 --> 10:15.060
a religion. They represent a shared compact to uphold the civic values of these places. And yes,

10:15.060 --> 10:20.700
to exclude those who refuse to uphold them. The socialist rejects civic nationalism because civic

10:20.700 --> 10:24.900
nationalism represents one of the greatest threats to the socialist project. Renan finishes his

10:24.900 --> 10:29.420
lecture by saying, man is everything in the formation of this sacred thing which is called

10:29.420 --> 10:34.220
a people. Nothing purely material suffices for it. A nation is a spiritual principle,

10:34.220 --> 10:39.060
the outcome of the profound complications of history. Two things which in truth are but one,

10:39.060 --> 10:44.980
constitute this soul or spiritual principle. One lies in the past, one in the present. One is the

10:44.980 --> 10:50.300
possession in common of a rich legacy of memories. The other is the present-day consent, the desire

10:50.300 --> 10:55.120
to live together, the will to perpetuate the value of the heritage that one has received. Man is a

10:55.120 --> 11:00.560
slave neither of his race nor his language, nor of his religion, nor of the course of rivers,

11:00.560 --> 11:06.120
nor the direction taken by mountain chains. A large aggregate of men, healthy in mind and warm

11:06.120 --> 11:11.360
of heart, creates the kind of moral conscience which we call a nation. A nation is a non-material

11:11.360 --> 11:15.640
thing that nonetheless exists as long as people believe in it. If the group of people who

11:15.640 --> 11:22.320
constitute a nation say, yes, these are my values, then that nation exists. And it's just as real as

11:22.320 --> 11:27.400
anything else. And the socialist, in aiming for a worldwide workers revolution in totality,

11:27.400 --> 11:33.320
must fundamentally be anti every nation. Or to be more precise, must work to craft an entirely

11:33.320 --> 11:37.040
different narrative for people to believe in. The narrative of the revolutionary working class.

11:37.040 --> 11:41.720
Which is confusing to me because even as these people reject nationalism as being inherently

11:41.720 --> 11:46.160
fascist, even though it's not, they're ultimately still hyper nationalistic when it comes to

11:46.160 --> 11:50.640
indigenous rights in Europe colonized countries. Despite their outward hatred of nationalism,

11:50.720 --> 11:55.880
when it comes to the status of say indigenous reservations, land claims, racial tensions,

11:55.880 --> 12:00.920
they suddenly revert to a level of blood and soil rhetoric that would make a Nazi blush. I thought

12:00.920 --> 12:06.480
progress was moving past the idea that ancestral ties to specific tracts of land gave those with

12:06.480 --> 12:11.800
the blood of a chosen race unique, exclusive and spiritual claims to that land. And yet these

12:11.800 --> 12:15.520
people are happy to jump backwards as soon as the claimant has brown skin. For those of you who

12:15.520 --> 12:20.320
don't know, Canada is responsible for the residential school system. I talked about it in

12:20.320 --> 12:25.880
my Canada 150 video, but that was like four years ago. As the history goes, the government of Canada

12:25.880 --> 12:30.880
and the Catholic Church ran a series of schools, the residential schools, for indigenous children.

12:30.880 --> 12:35.880
In 1969, many of the schools were closed, and the ones that stayed open underwent some much needed

12:35.880 --> 12:41.680
reforms. By 1996, the final school had closed. From the 1880s, up until that reformation point

12:41.680 --> 12:46.640
in 1969, the residential schools carried out an ethnic cleansing of the indigenous population

12:46.640 --> 12:50.480
of Canada. Indigenous children were taken from their parents and placed into these schools where

12:50.480 --> 12:55.080
they could be reeducated to think, speak and act European. Additionally, there is solid evidence

12:55.080 --> 13:00.240
of rampant physical and sexual abuse of the children at these schools. Around the same time,

13:00.240 --> 13:05.480
the USA was enshrining the national rights of its indigenous populations as recognized ethnic

13:05.480 --> 13:11.000
nations within their multinational union. Canada would not do the same until 1985. About a month

13:11.000 --> 13:16.280
and a half ago, a mass burial site was discovered at the location of several of Canada's residential

13:16.320 --> 13:20.920
schools. It was initially reported that the bodies of 215 native children were discovered,

13:20.920 --> 13:27.320
but that number has since risen to, the last I checked, 1,505. This isn't quite like American

13:27.320 --> 13:31.400
slavery, where both the slaves and the slave masters have been dead for over a century,

13:31.400 --> 13:35.600
and so those people who are complaining about it today have no idea what they're talking about.

13:35.600 --> 13:40.840
There are victims alive today who suffered under the system. Some people say we shouldn't celebrate

13:40.840 --> 13:45.480
Canada Day today since this drama is unfolding right now, and it's a pretty huge stain on the

13:45.720 --> 13:50.760
national identity. Fair enough. Those same people would rather see a commemoration of those dead

13:50.760 --> 13:55.040
kids. I can understand that. I'm assuming you're probably an American listening to this right now,

13:55.040 --> 14:00.660
based on the demographics that YouTube gives me. For you, this would be like, say in May,

14:00.660 --> 14:05.720
somebody discovers a new mass grave of black slaves in the south somewhere, and as a result

14:05.720 --> 14:10.240
of this discovery, activists in your country are demanding that July 4th this year be cancelled.

14:10.240 --> 14:15.800
Would you agree with that? I don't know. I understand their anger, especially the still

14:15.800 --> 14:20.280
living survivors. At the very least, they clearly deserve a big fat cheque from the Canadian

14:20.280 --> 14:24.960
government. But does that mean I want Canada and all of its legitimately good things to vanish?

14:24.960 --> 14:29.520
Would that help anybody? Surely we're capable of reckoning with the past while still celebrating

14:29.520 --> 14:34.640
the actual good we've done, and there's a lot of it. Surely that is the spirit of civic nationalism.

14:34.640 --> 14:38.640
We don't need to simply say fuck it and draw racial lines, but we also don't need to throw

14:38.640 --> 14:42.240
the baby out with the bathwater, simply because nationalism bad socialism good.

14:42.240 --> 14:46.480
Renan correctly said that a functioning nationalism requires moving beyond past

14:46.480 --> 14:50.360
atrocities, not getting mired in the hatred that the people who came before you held.

14:50.360 --> 14:54.640
But there's also a practical reality that you cannot use that principle to prevent justice

14:54.640 --> 14:58.460
from being served. I understand that because of the recent discoveries here in Canada,

14:58.460 --> 15:03.240
leftists want Canada Day cancelled. But you know what? Leftists have been clamoring for Canada Day

15:03.240 --> 15:07.600
to be cancelled for decades now. They're using the legitimacy of a recent event to bolster their

15:07.600 --> 15:12.680
voice. And the truth is, if Canada Day is cancelled this year for this reason, then

15:12.680 --> 15:17.320
they will cancel it every year for this reason, because their goal is ultimately to destroy civic

15:17.320 --> 15:23.040
nationalism. They're anti liberal, and that for me is reason enough to oppose them. I recognize all

15:23.040 --> 15:27.240
the bad that my country has done. I recognize that there are still things we can do today to

15:27.240 --> 15:33.440
right those wrongs. And in that spirit explicitly, I am celebrating Canada Day today. Thanks for

15:33.440 --> 15:36.800
listening, guys. I hope you enjoyed the video. Speaking of Canada Day, I will be doing a Canada

15:36.800 --> 15:40.920
Day stream tonight. Me and my friends are going to play the indie game Death Road to Canada. We

15:40.920 --> 15:45.480
play it every year on July 1st on Twitch. Not going to be talking about politics tonight. We're

15:45.480 --> 15:48.680
going to be hanging out talking with the chat and having a good time. So please consider dropping

15:48.680 --> 15:53.240
by twitch.tv slash game boomers. I'll see you there. Thanks very much for listening. I love you
