0	9460	It's finally time, guys. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna say the word describing something
9460	15080	so toxic, it must be opposed in all of its forms. The word referring to a people and
15080	18640	how they are different from others around them. The word whose underlying ideas are
18640	23060	a relic of the past. Once accepted in all of its glory, but today must be violently
23060	29080	cast aside for the march of progress to continue. It is now time to say that dreaded word.
29080	33960	N- N- NATIONALISM
33960	38860	Nationalism refers to the individual's identification with their nation and support for the interests
38860	44020	of that nation, sometimes but not always leading to the exclusion or detriment of the interests
44020	49200	or individuals of other nations. Following that, a nation is a large body of people united
49200	55080	by common ancestry, history, culture, language or some other factor, generally inhabiting
55080	59340	a particular country or territory. Nowadays, we have a tendency to use the word nation
59340	63560	to refer to an organized political community under the control of a government, but that's
63560	68900	actually what a state is. In today's colloquial speech, nation and state are used interchangeably.
68900	73680	This came about due to the early 1900s preference for the concept of the nation state. A nation
73680	77840	state is a political organization where the nation, the people of some common ethnicity
77840	83480	in a common location, and the state, the government with the jurisdiction over that location,
83480	87960	are congruent. Political science of the time advocated for nation state building as a way
87960	93240	to maximize freedom and prosperity, as opposed to imperialism, where multiple nations paid
93240	98200	a central imperial authority to fund their own oppression, or colonialism, where a ruling
98200	102660	nation would forcibly convert the people of a rival nation to their own. Common examples
102660	106700	of the nation state are Israel and Japan, where the populations of the state of Israel
106700	112120	and the state of Japan are overwhelmingly ethnically Jewish and Japanese respectively.
112120	116580	Nations and progressive movements are generally anti-nationalist. They view their goals as
116580	121160	being fundamentally globalist, and with good reason. Trade and diplomacy are international
121160	125320	endeavors, generally with huge benefits to the people involved, and an insular world
125320	129560	view can hamper those efforts. At the same time, there's also a solid moral argument
129560	133780	to be made. If there's an ethnic cleansing happening somewhere, it doesn't sound convincing
133780	137840	to simply ignore it because it's happening in somebody else's backyard. The obvious problem
137840	142620	though is when a state begins to ignore domestic issues in favor of foreign ones, where the
142620	148000	international takes precedence over the national. Nationalism as an ideology is linked to fascism.
148000	152240	This is often correct. The fascists of many countries, most notably Nazi Germany, appealed
152240	158240	to ethnicity and ethnic nationalism as justification for their wars of expansion, ethnic cleansings,
158240	162300	and totality of state control of the whole society. The Nazis believed that because the
162300	166500	ethnic German people were scattered across multiple different states in Europe, Nazi
166500	171200	Germany had a moral obligation to unite them under one state. One people, one language,
171200	176820	one Reich. Ernst Renan gave his famous lecture, What is a Nation?, in 1882, where he described
176820	181380	multiple problems with the ethnic idea of nationhood. He first notices that large empires
181380	186940	like Egypt, Rome, and China were in fact not nations, but were multi-ethnic empires,
186940	191500	with varying levels of stability and integration across time. From this we can see that, although
191500	196380	nation states do exist, it is not a requirement that a state map onto an ethnicity for that
197260	201940	Renan brings up the great Germanic invasion of France in the 5th century, lasting until
201940	206660	the 10th century Norman conquests, and how it caused an entirely forgotten change in
206660	212020	the Frankish Empire. Renan states, France became quite legitimately the name of a country
212020	217140	to which only a virtually imperceptible minority of Franks had come. The idea that the population
217140	222260	of France was composed of different races was in no way apparent to French writers.
222260	227220	The difference between noble and serf was as sharply drawn as possible, but it was in
227220	231180	no sense presented as an ethnic difference. It was presented rather as a difference in
231180	235940	courage, customs, and education. It did not occur to anyone that the origin of all of
235940	241220	this was a conquest. After one or two generations, the Norman invaders no longer distinguished
241220	244580	themselves from the rest of the population, although their influence was not any less
244580	248740	profound because of this fact. They had given the conquered country a nobility, military
248740	252820	habits, and a patriotism that they had not known before. In other words, even though
252820	257300	the invaders of France had settled there and had become the new rulers of that land, they
257300	261540	nonetheless adopted some French customs, just as the French had adopted some of theirs.
261540	266340	And although a sophisticated genetic analysis of the lords and the serfs, if one had existed,
266340	271660	may have revealed two entirely different ethnic groups, nobody alive at that time saw themselves
271660	276620	as anything other than a unified French people. In fact, as Renan goes on to clarify, the
276620	280780	unity of the French people required not only the creation of a common national story that
280780	284820	they could tell each other, but the forgetting of certain facts that could threaten that
284820	285820	unity.
285820	290380	The union of northern France with the media was the result of massacres and terror lasting
290380	294940	for the best part of a century. No French citizen knows whether he is a Burgundian,
294940	300680	an Allen, a Taifal, or a Visigoth, yet every French citizen has to have forgotten the massacre
300680	304980	of Saint Bartholomew, or the massacres that took place in the media in the 13th century.
304980	311100	You might see it as ahistorical or anti-intellectual or something, to forget a part of history,
311100	315500	especially something as key as a massacre. But on some level, everybody has grievance
315500	320120	with everybody else, and to live in a civil society, you must eventually forget.
320120	324380	Nobody today views France as a series of ethnic groups that fought bloody wars between north,
324380	328580	central, and southern France, and that they're somehow all united in a tenuous alliance,
328580	332780	just waiting for the republic to collapse. No, we all see them as French, they see themselves
332780	337380	as French. They have forgotten those battles, and those massacres, and those conquests.
337380	342740	Brennan also takes aim at the idea that language should be some universal unifying factor.
342740	347940	To that, he says, nothing could be more false. Prussia, where only German is now spoken,
347940	353540	spoke Slav a few centuries ago. In Wales, English is spoken. Gaul and Spain speak the
353540	359140	same primitive dialects of Alba Longa. Egypt speaks Arabic. Slaves often speak the same
359140	363460	language as their masters, but are often enough a different race to that of their masters.
363460	369440	The point here is that race and language can be the basis for a nation, but it is not the basis
369440	374060	to force a nation where one is not wanted by that population. Renan offers several examples of this
374060	380620	in action. In our own day, the day of 1882, we have seen Italy unified through its defeats,
380620	385780	and the Ottoman Empire destroyed by its victories. Each defeat advanced the cause of Italy,
385780	390940	each victory spelled doom for the Ottomans. For Italy is a nation, and the Ottomans,
390940	395660	outside of the Turks and Asia Minor, is not one. How is it that Switzerland, which has three
395660	400580	languages, two religions, and three or four races, is a nation, while Tuscany, which is so
400580	404980	homogenous, is not one? Switzerland, being of Germanic origin but spending most of its history
404980	411140	as explicitly anti-German, brings us back to the Nazi desire to unify all ethnic Germans under one
411140	416620	state. Renan predicts their attempts to do so 50 years before by understanding the logical outcome
416620	421420	of ethnic nationalism. The Germanic family, according to the theory I am expounding here,
421420	426500	has the right to reassemble the scattered limbs of the Germanic order, even when these limbs are
426500	431180	not asking to be joined together again. This is where we get the liberal answer to nationalism,
431180	437180	civic nationalism. It's the idea that a nation is not based on a race or an ethnicity or a language
437180	442860	or a historic location, but rather on the shared liberal values, principles, and a willingness to
442860	448180	uphold those political institutions. This idea is, in my opinion, one of the greatest French
448180	452100	contributions to the liberal tradition. The English liberals have a lot going for them,
452100	456340	don't get me wrong. They started the tradition, and I think Locke is their greatest writer,
456340	460260	but in my opinion it would have been a lot harder for the English to come up with civic nationalism,
460260	463780	mainly because the differences in their political structures. As we talked about earlier,
463820	469420	nationalism relies, on some level, on the ability to forget past slights. To say that those battles,
469420	473940	those massacres, those atrocities were in the past, done by different individuals, and for
473940	478780	better or worse we're unified now. A state of affairs that people on all sides must voluntarily
478780	483940	come to if that nation is to survive. But the civil structures of Great Britain, of Canada,
483940	489500	of the United States, are not nation states, but instead are multinational unions. The British are
489500	494380	not some homogenizing union of Britons, forgetting about the existence of England, Scotland, and
494380	499100	Wales. They are a political union of distinct nations, each with their own national pride.
499100	504620	The United States is not a state, it is 50 states, an alliance for a common cause. Canada
504620	508960	rests atop a delicate balance of English and French ethnic interests, agreed upon to end a
508960	513980	war. It's Renan who first understood that lasting peace only comes when people forget their pasts,
513980	518580	and in doing so, forget the reasons to oppose their neighbors. If you're an English liberal
518580	521860	getting mad at me talking about this, don't worry about it. Most of the rest of French
521860	526700	philosophy is garbage, you're fine. However, the progressive and the socialist reject nationalism
526700	532980	in all of its forms, both ethnic and civil, and in doing so, rejects the open liberal democratic
532980	537820	society. They understand that a society is destroyed by ethnic tension, and so the civic
537820	543180	national prescription of letting bygones be bygones has to be suppressed. This is why racial
543180	547420	agitators exist. People who seek to constantly dredge up the history of slavery in the United
547460	551140	States hundreds of years later, or those professional victims who divide people into
551140	555780	oppressed and oppressor classes in order to sow disunity. Let's be clear though, unity is not
555780	560820	the greatest value. There is certainly a time and place for disunity. Let's say one person murders
560820	565980	another. Before the blood is cold is not the time to say, hey, let bygones be bygones. Let's all
565980	570180	forget this happened to move on in a civil way. If the perpetrator of a crime still lives, then
570180	575100	there still exists a moral duty to see his debt to society paid. If the victims are gone and the
575100	579260	perpetrators are gone, then what good is there in dredging up the past? What does it do other
579260	584180	than create more problems? This is why that multi-ethnic griller meme is so wholesome. They
584180	588820	know what their ancestors did was wrong, but that shouldn't stop civil society from moving forward
588820	593460	for everybody's benefit. The progressive rejects civic nationalism out of ignorance. They see the
593460	598620	American flag, the Canadian flag, the British flag, whatever it is, and scream fascist because
598620	604020	they believe that nationalism can only be ethnic, and therefore any symbol of nationalism can only
604140	609380	refer to ethnic supremacy. Of course, they're wrong. These flags don't represent a race or
609380	615060	a religion. They represent a shared compact to uphold the civic values of these places. And yes,
615060	620700	to exclude those who refuse to uphold them. The socialist rejects civic nationalism because civic
620700	624900	nationalism represents one of the greatest threats to the socialist project. Renan finishes his
624900	629420	lecture by saying, man is everything in the formation of this sacred thing which is called
629420	634220	a people. Nothing purely material suffices for it. A nation is a spiritual principle,
634220	639060	the outcome of the profound complications of history. Two things which in truth are but one,
639060	644980	constitute this soul or spiritual principle. One lies in the past, one in the present. One is the
644980	650300	possession in common of a rich legacy of memories. The other is the present-day consent, the desire
650300	655120	to live together, the will to perpetuate the value of the heritage that one has received. Man is a
655120	660560	slave neither of his race nor his language, nor of his religion, nor of the course of rivers,
660560	666120	nor the direction taken by mountain chains. A large aggregate of men, healthy in mind and warm
666120	671360	of heart, creates the kind of moral conscience which we call a nation. A nation is a non-material
671360	675640	thing that nonetheless exists as long as people believe in it. If the group of people who
675640	682320	constitute a nation say, yes, these are my values, then that nation exists. And it's just as real as
682320	687400	anything else. And the socialist, in aiming for a worldwide workers revolution in totality,
687400	693320	must fundamentally be anti every nation. Or to be more precise, must work to craft an entirely
693320	697040	different narrative for people to believe in. The narrative of the revolutionary working class.
697040	701720	Which is confusing to me because even as these people reject nationalism as being inherently
701720	706160	fascist, even though it's not, they're ultimately still hyper nationalistic when it comes to
706160	710640	indigenous rights in Europe colonized countries. Despite their outward hatred of nationalism,
710720	715880	when it comes to the status of say indigenous reservations, land claims, racial tensions,
715880	720920	they suddenly revert to a level of blood and soil rhetoric that would make a Nazi blush. I thought
720920	726480	progress was moving past the idea that ancestral ties to specific tracts of land gave those with
726480	731800	the blood of a chosen race unique, exclusive and spiritual claims to that land. And yet these
731800	735520	people are happy to jump backwards as soon as the claimant has brown skin. For those of you who
735520	740320	don't know, Canada is responsible for the residential school system. I talked about it in
740320	745880	my Canada 150 video, but that was like four years ago. As the history goes, the government of Canada
745880	750880	and the Catholic Church ran a series of schools, the residential schools, for indigenous children.
750880	755880	In 1969, many of the schools were closed, and the ones that stayed open underwent some much needed
755880	761680	reforms. By 1996, the final school had closed. From the 1880s, up until that reformation point
761680	766640	in 1969, the residential schools carried out an ethnic cleansing of the indigenous population
766640	770480	of Canada. Indigenous children were taken from their parents and placed into these schools where
770480	775080	they could be reeducated to think, speak and act European. Additionally, there is solid evidence
775080	780240	of rampant physical and sexual abuse of the children at these schools. Around the same time,
780240	785480	the USA was enshrining the national rights of its indigenous populations as recognized ethnic
785480	791000	nations within their multinational union. Canada would not do the same until 1985. About a month
791000	796280	and a half ago, a mass burial site was discovered at the location of several of Canada's residential
796320	800920	schools. It was initially reported that the bodies of 215 native children were discovered,
800920	807320	but that number has since risen to, the last I checked, 1,505. This isn't quite like American
807320	811400	slavery, where both the slaves and the slave masters have been dead for over a century,
811400	815600	and so those people who are complaining about it today have no idea what they're talking about.
815600	820840	There are victims alive today who suffered under the system. Some people say we shouldn't celebrate
820840	825480	Canada Day today since this drama is unfolding right now, and it's a pretty huge stain on the
825720	830760	national identity. Fair enough. Those same people would rather see a commemoration of those dead
830760	835040	kids. I can understand that. I'm assuming you're probably an American listening to this right now,
835040	840660	based on the demographics that YouTube gives me. For you, this would be like, say in May,
840660	845720	somebody discovers a new mass grave of black slaves in the south somewhere, and as a result
845720	850240	of this discovery, activists in your country are demanding that July 4th this year be cancelled.
850240	855800	Would you agree with that? I don't know. I understand their anger, especially the still
855800	860280	living survivors. At the very least, they clearly deserve a big fat cheque from the Canadian
860280	864960	government. But does that mean I want Canada and all of its legitimately good things to vanish?
864960	869520	Would that help anybody? Surely we're capable of reckoning with the past while still celebrating
869520	874640	the actual good we've done, and there's a lot of it. Surely that is the spirit of civic nationalism.
874640	878640	We don't need to simply say fuck it and draw racial lines, but we also don't need to throw
878640	882240	the baby out with the bathwater, simply because nationalism bad socialism good.
882240	886480	Renan correctly said that a functioning nationalism requires moving beyond past
886480	890360	atrocities, not getting mired in the hatred that the people who came before you held.
890360	894640	But there's also a practical reality that you cannot use that principle to prevent justice
894640	898460	from being served. I understand that because of the recent discoveries here in Canada,
898460	903240	leftists want Canada Day cancelled. But you know what? Leftists have been clamoring for Canada Day
903240	907600	to be cancelled for decades now. They're using the legitimacy of a recent event to bolster their
907600	912680	voice. And the truth is, if Canada Day is cancelled this year for this reason, then
912680	917320	they will cancel it every year for this reason, because their goal is ultimately to destroy civic
917320	923040	nationalism. They're anti liberal, and that for me is reason enough to oppose them. I recognize all
923040	927240	the bad that my country has done. I recognize that there are still things we can do today to
927240	933440	right those wrongs. And in that spirit explicitly, I am celebrating Canada Day today. Thanks for
933440	936800	listening, guys. I hope you enjoyed the video. Speaking of Canada Day, I will be doing a Canada
936800	940920	Day stream tonight. Me and my friends are going to play the indie game Death Road to Canada. We
940920	945480	play it every year on July 1st on Twitch. Not going to be talking about politics tonight. We're
945480	948680	going to be hanging out talking with the chat and having a good time. So please consider dropping
948680	953240	by twitch.tv slash game boomers. I'll see you there. Thanks very much for listening. I love you
