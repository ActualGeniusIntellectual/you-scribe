0	10560	Normally, when I talk about a topic that involves video games, or internet culture, or sometimes
10560	13660	YouTuber drama, I'll make it into an indefensible video.
13660	18240	You know, with that cool opening that everyone seems to like that goes doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo,
18240	19240	you know that one?
19240	22660	Where everyone in the comments says, OMG, Dev brought it back, whenever I make a new
22660	24000	video in that series?
24000	27180	Well, the Yong-Yei story does fit that bill.
27180	31320	It's about video games, and internet culture, and YouTuber drama, but I don't actually
31320	34220	think there's enough meat on this bone for a deep dive.
34220	37780	There might not even be enough here for a full ten minutes, but I'll give it a try.
37780	42900	Plus, the indefensible intro is, uh, constantly copyright struck, so hey, support the channel!
42900	47260	Yong-Yei is a YouTuber who got his start back in January of 2012.
47260	50780	Looking at his backlog, he did all sorts of things to try and get ahead in the YouTuber
50780	51780	game back then.
51780	54540	Let's plays, unboxings, reporting on gaming news.
54540	58500	He eventually settled into making short videos, generally only a few minutes long, talking
58500	63780	about minute updates a few select games were receiving, what the next Fallout 4 patch looked
63780	68700	like, what new character was recently announced for Smash Bros on Wii U, that sort of thing.
68700	73140	Gaming news is what he eventually settled into, talking about trade shows or award shows,
73140	76500	talking about upcoming games, interviews with journalists or people in the industry.
76500	79820	I never really watched him, but from what I checked out for this video, it was all good
79820	80820	stuff.
80820	84100	High quality for that era of YouTube still holds up today, and is probably why he has
84660	85660	over a million subs now.
85660	89380	I'll also just quickly say, whenever I do a video like this, looking into a YouTuber's
89380	92220	past always feels like unearthing a time capsule, you know?
92220	96060	For example, one of the oldest videos still surviving on the channel is his Let's Play
96060	100500	of the Mass Effect 3 demo, from before Mass Effect 3 was released.
100500	103860	That game is considered retro nowadays, but at the time the video was released, it was
103860	107480	cutting edge, and the video is full of decade old comments of people clamoring about the
107480	108480	game.
108480	113580	Also, seeing young Yong-Yei, Yong-Yei I guess, do old style YouTube skits was just surreal
113580	114580	to me.
114580	118300	In modern times, Yong-Yei's channel has more or less stuck to the gaming news thing,
118300	123600	though generally not as granular as discussing patch notes or updates for specific games.
123600	127480	That YouTube trend was done best by TotalBiscuit, and it basically died with him.
127480	132260	There still exist channels who do update videos or meta conversations about specific games,
132260	135700	like Warcraft channels, or Hollow Knight channels, or Zelda channels, or Overwatch channels.
135700	139560	But the reason that there are channels dedicated to specific game franchises, is because we've
139560	143320	basically figured out at this point in the YouTube game, that interest in the minutiae
143320	147520	of a specific patch for a specific game is a niche market, not something that really
147520	151860	sits well on a general gaming news channel.
151860	156260	But with this general gaming news thing, Yong-Yei's done pretty well for himself.
156260	159560	And because this is a YouTuber we're talking about here, it was inevitable that he would
159560	162720	eventually put his foot in his mouth, and then shoot it.
162720	167640	RGG Studio announced that Yong-Yei was cast as the English voice actor of Kiryu from the
167640	169600	Yakuza series of games.
169600	170880	Here's Yong-Yei's own announcement.
170880	175980	4 years ago I moved to LA with dreams of one day playing a AAA game protagonist, but
175980	178560	I never imagined I'd land such a legendary role.
178560	182400	It's the greatest honor of my life to announce I'm the English voice of the Dragon of Dojima,
182400	185600	Kazuma Kiryu, in Yakuza Gaiden and 8.
185600	189280	Now I'm only lukewarm on Yakuza, Yong-Yei likes them more than me, but I do understand
189280	192040	that Kiryu is the heart and soul of the series.
192040	196000	He's a beloved character in a beloved series that has spawned its share of high quality
196000	197000	memes.
197000	198920	But right from the get-go there's a few red flags here.
198920	203040	Firstly, that whole 4 years ago I moved to LA thing, I've said it a few times on this
203040	204540	channel and I'll say it again.
204540	208760	If your favorite YouTuber or streamer decides the next big step in their career is to fly
208760	212240	out to LA and start making connections in the influencer space, pack it up.
212240	214700	It's time to find a new favorite because they're done son.
214700	217840	They might keep making money and growing, but the quality of their content is going
217840	221640	to rapidly decline as they start bending to the will of the connections they've made
221640	224920	and begin injecting the political views of the environment that they're in.
224920	229940	LA is a cesspool of insufferably smug progressive elitism, and from what I've heard from long
229940	234440	time viewers, Yong-Yei was no exception to the rule, he slid down this slope just like
234440	235440	everyone else.
235440	237760	Secondly, there's the quality of his voice.
237760	241320	Yong-Yei did a line reading at Anime Expo 2023, here's the clip
254920	262400	The fan backlash to this centered on how Yong-Yei's Kiryu voice sounds too much
262400	263400	like his own.
263400	266420	And considering that in the game that Yong-Yei is playing Kiryu, he's middle aged at this
266420	271720	point, yeah I agree, he's too young sounding to be the voice of a gray haired retired Kiryu.
271720	275540	Yong-Yei's response to this was to post the official clip of the line from the video
275540	279240	game on his twitter, as a way of saying no it's good guys, just listen to how it sounds
279240	280240	about the echoes of the panel.
280240	283440	But that received so much backlash he deleted the tweet.
283440	304640	Here's the deleted video.
304640	306480	Yeah this still ain't great.
306480	311280	Somebody made a fan edit on YouTube, splicing in the Anime Expo audio overtop the in-game
311280	315840	cutscene.
315840	332840	Hey, at least it's not as bad as the actual golem game buddy.
332840	336680	Yong-Yei's reply to the viral clip was to complain that it was misinformation, that
336680	340880	it was poorly recorded audio from an off the cuff panel and the script was unlocalized
340880	343760	and it was all superimposed into the Japanese trailer.
343760	346880	Many people even think it's official because of the video, but they hadn't even recorded
346880	347960	that scene yet.
347960	351640	You know, I thought that previous deleted clip was the official recording, but maybe
351640	354280	he just did it off the cuff for comparison sake.
354280	357480	Everyone had their doubts about this, but the game was still months off, maybe it wouldn't
357480	358480	be so bad.
358480	361960	And then when the game's demo dropped, everyone's doubts were confirmed.
361960	364400	This clip went viral with the attached tweet.
364400	370000	I just heard actual English Kiryu voice and uh, Yong-Yei as a casting choice fucking sucked,
370000	389120	I'm so sorry.
389120	393280	Here's Yong-Yei's official clip, tagged with did a side by side with the Japanese
393280	394840	for those wanting to hear the difference.
394840	397520	This is some of the first stuff we recorded a year ago.
397520	399720	The performance got more refined as we went further along.
399720	427080	I'm excited for y'all to experience the full games.
427080	428760	This just isn't working man.
428800	432400	No offense to Yong-Yei himself, this isn't a personal attack on the man, but he was not
432400	434040	the right choice for this character.
434040	436400	There's a couple of things at play here.
436400	440240	Firstly is that the previous English voice actor for Kiryu, Daryl Kurilo, seems to be
440240	441480	a complete cuck.
441480	446280	His reaction to Yong-Yei swiping his job out from under him is, I am very happy and honored
446280	449560	to have played a wonderfully written and iconic character as Kiryu.
449560	453200	I am just as happy to discover that the role will be portrayed by a dedicated actor who
453200	455520	more closely matches Kiryu's culture.
455520	456520	I approve.
456520	460880	I gotta do a deep dive into this topic at some point, but there is this weird woke racial
460880	465000	segregationist movement happening in voice acting right now, where progressives in that
465000	469460	space are demanding that characters of a specific race can only be voice acted by actors who
469460	474640	share that race, so that they can embody the racial experiences or some other racist KKK
474640	475640	ass nonsense.
475640	480900	Secondly, is the more general rule of, don't hire YouTubers to be in your fucking video
480900	482300	games, it never ends well.
482300	485880	I know, I get it, you want to connect with the kids and get some of their money by attaching
485880	489800	that brand to your product, but it almost always makes it shittier.
489800	493520	You can count the number of career transitions into more traditional entertainment YouTubers
493520	497560	have made that have been successful and non-cringe on like, one hand.
497560	498560	We all know it's true.
498560	501340	You're sitting there, playing a video game or watching a show, and then suddenly you
501340	504800	hear Egoraptor's voice or Markiplier's or something, and you just want to shut it
504800	505800	off.
505800	509120	And it's not even necessarily because they're bad voice actors, though they usually are,
509120	513400	it's that even if they're good, they're still bringing with them that LA funk.
513400	516640	That progressive elitist clique that you and I will never be a part of.
516640	520680	Full of people who look down on us and hate the fact that they still need us to buy their
520680	521680	slop.
521680	526520	Anyway, after the repeated negative feedback, Yongye began to mass block people on Twitter
526520	527520	and hide replies.
527520	530940	I understand, man, you're not going to accept any criticism, you're going to stay the
530940	533520	course and drive this fucking thing right into the ground.
533520	538200	But you've got to understand, nobody, and I mean nobody, wants to hear your auto-tuned
538200	540200	voice sing these songs.
540200	556640	It got so bad that Yongye began to block his supporters who weren't perfectly marching
556640	558080	in lockstep with him.
558080	562120	Like for Tanga here, who said that Yongye was a bad Kiryu, but he shouldn't be cancel
562120	567520	cultured by people bringing up unrelated slur usage from years ago as an avenue of attack.
567520	569480	And he got his ass blocked for that.
569480	571260	Yongye is going full scorched earth, man.
571260	573000	This is all very hypocritical.
573000	576560	Because while he is blocking people who are just haters, who are saying stuff like you
576560	581400	suck or whatever, he's also blocking people who are making the reasonable obvious criticism
581400	584920	that Yongye is just not a good fit for the character of Kiryu.
584920	589960	A criticism that Yongye himself made against Chris Pratt voicing Mario in the Mario Brothers
589960	590960	movie.
590960	593980	Now the one thing that everyone's talking about is of course Mario's voice.
593980	597900	This is the main character, this is an iconic character, there's a very specific voice
597900	601300	and type of performance that we associate with Mario's character.
601300	605500	And this trailer finally gave us a glimpse of what Mario will sound like who is played
605500	607420	by Chris Pratt.
607420	612220	And I'll be honest, when I first watched this trailer, I was kind of disappointed.
612220	616340	I was a little taken aback by how much Mario just sounds like Chris Pratt doing like a
616340	617860	bit of a Brooklyn accent.
617860	622580	This still shot right here is a pretty appropriate representation of my reaction, that first
622580	624120	knee jerk impression.
624120	628160	This article dropped on The Gamer, Kazuma Kiryu's English voice was always going to
628160	632600	be impossible, making the point that Kiryu's voice and character and the story of the games
632600	636720	is quintessentially Japanese, translating them into English has never really worked,
636720	640500	and that it's not actually a problem with Yongye, whoever they chose was basically doomed
640500	641500	to failure from the get-go.
641500	644880	There's probably something to this view, I don't know anybody who plays Yakuza with
644880	648180	any language other than the Japanese, it certainly feels more authentic.
648180	652860	But before Yongye took over, the English dub of Yakuza was only considered superfluous
652860	655980	by the fans, not a direct sabotaging of the game.
655980	660320	It's true that no English voice actor can ever truly be Kiryu, but there are absolutely
660320	665480	people who come way closer than Yongye, and his inclusion really just feels like capitalizing
665480	666780	on YouTuber clout.
666780	671620	Moreover, Yongye actually has a history of doing this sort of thing whenever controversy
671620	672780	rears its ugly head.
672780	676820	He has a history of deleting videos and deleting comments, in order to try and control public
676820	677820	opinion of him.
677820	681160	A lot of these other stories never went viral, and they're lost to time because he was
681160	685920	just so good at scrubbing the online narrative, but you can still find crumbs here and there.
685920	687280	This isn't how you do it, man.
687280	689040	I mean, who am I to say that, I guess?
689040	691040	I've got 140,000 subs and he's got over a million.
691040	694640	But if you want to remain a good person, this isn't how you do it.
694640	698120	I've had takes that people didn't like, I've put out videos that people hated, I've
698120	702040	received more than my fair share of flak on the internet, I've had my mentions full
702040	706140	of thousands of replies, people telling me to kill myself or delete my channel, or insulting
706140	710240	my weight or insulting my girlfriend or whatever else, multiple times now, and I've never
710240	712400	gone on a mass-block delete spree.
712400	714900	I've never taken down videos or tweets for that.
714900	717980	You just carry on and hope people will come around, and if they don't, you try again
717980	718980	next time.
718980	721440	I think this is an Egoraptor-style story.
721440	725360	Despite all of Yangye's YouTube success, he always wanted to be an actor or a voice
725360	729080	actor, and he viewed YouTube as secondary, as the job he settled on doing rather than
729080	730320	the job he wanted.
730320	733960	And now that his YouTube channel is moving him into actor spaces, that's become his
733960	734960	personality.
734960	738880	That's why he says, I earned Kiryu, that's why his Twitter name is now the English voice
738880	743480	of Kiryu, and why he's posting videos on his channel saying, Kiryu auditions for Mario,
743480	748680	or Kiryu's voice actor reacts to trailers, or I met Kiryu, which is just his fans meeting
748680	749680	him.
749680	753740	Kiryu is Yangye's crown jewel, it doesn't matter how much he ruins the character and
753740	757040	destroys the franchise, it's a stepping stone in his career, and that's what he
757040	758040	cares about.
758040	761980	He can now put on his resume that he was the lead role in the multi-million-copy-selling
761980	763400	Yakuza series.
763400	766720	This isn't going to stop by the way, Yangye just announced that he's going to be voicing
766720	770080	a character in the Persona 3 remake, and he's probably going to rape that project
770080	771400	into the ground too.
771400	775720	Shitty nepotistic LA YouTubers are going to keep providing dogshit voice performances
775720	778200	in these games, as long as they're profitable.
778200	790920	Stay informed and vote with your wallet, guys.
