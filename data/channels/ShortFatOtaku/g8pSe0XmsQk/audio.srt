1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,560
Normally, when I talk about a topic that involves video games, or internet culture, or sometimes

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,660
YouTuber drama, I'll make it into an indefensible video.

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,240
You know, with that cool opening that everyone seems to like that goes doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo,

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,240
you know that one?

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,660
Where everyone in the comments says, OMG, Dev brought it back, whenever I make a new

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,000
video in that series?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,180
Well, the Yong-Yei story does fit that bill.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,320
It's about video games, and internet culture, and YouTuber drama, but I don't actually

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,220
think there's enough meat on this bone for a deep dive.

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,780
There might not even be enough here for a full ten minutes, but I'll give it a try.

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,900
Plus, the indefensible intro is, uh, constantly copyright struck, so hey, support the channel!

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,260
Yong-Yei is a YouTuber who got his start back in January of 2012.

13
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,780
Looking at his backlog, he did all sorts of things to try and get ahead in the YouTuber

14
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,780
game back then.

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,540
Let's plays, unboxings, reporting on gaming news.

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,500
He eventually settled into making short videos, generally only a few minutes long, talking

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,780
about minute updates a few select games were receiving, what the next Fallout 4 patch looked

18
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,700
like, what new character was recently announced for Smash Bros on Wii U, that sort of thing.

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,140
Gaming news is what he eventually settled into, talking about trade shows or award shows,

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,500
talking about upcoming games, interviews with journalists or people in the industry.

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,820
I never really watched him, but from what I checked out for this video, it was all good

22
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,820
stuff.

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,100
High quality for that era of YouTube still holds up today, and is probably why he has

24
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,660
over a million subs now.

25
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,380
I'll also just quickly say, whenever I do a video like this, looking into a YouTuber's

26
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,220
past always feels like unearthing a time capsule, you know?

27
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,060
For example, one of the oldest videos still surviving on the channel is his Let's Play

28
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,500
of the Mass Effect 3 demo, from before Mass Effect 3 was released.

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,860
That game is considered retro nowadays, but at the time the video was released, it was

30
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,480
cutting edge, and the video is full of decade old comments of people clamoring about the

31
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
game.

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,580
Also, seeing young Yong-Yei, Yong-Yei I guess, do old style YouTube skits was just surreal

33
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,580
to me.

34
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,300
In modern times, Yong-Yei's channel has more or less stuck to the gaming news thing,

35
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,600
though generally not as granular as discussing patch notes or updates for specific games.

36
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,480
That YouTube trend was done best by TotalBiscuit, and it basically died with him.

37
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,260
There still exist channels who do update videos or meta conversations about specific games,

38
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,700
like Warcraft channels, or Hollow Knight channels, or Zelda channels, or Overwatch channels.

39
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,560
But the reason that there are channels dedicated to specific game franchises, is because we've

40
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,320
basically figured out at this point in the YouTube game, that interest in the minutiae

41
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,520
of a specific patch for a specific game is a niche market, not something that really

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,860
sits well on a general gaming news channel.

43
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,260
But with this general gaming news thing, Yong-Yei's done pretty well for himself.

44
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,560
And because this is a YouTuber we're talking about here, it was inevitable that he would

45
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,720
eventually put his foot in his mouth, and then shoot it.

46
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,640
RGG Studio announced that Yong-Yei was cast as the English voice actor of Kiryu from the

47
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,600
Yakuza series of games.

48
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,880
Here's Yong-Yei's own announcement.

49
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,980
4 years ago I moved to LA with dreams of one day playing a AAA game protagonist, but

50
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,560
I never imagined I'd land such a legendary role.

51
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,400
It's the greatest honor of my life to announce I'm the English voice of the Dragon of Dojima,

52
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,600
Kazuma Kiryu, in Yakuza Gaiden and 8.

53
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,280
Now I'm only lukewarm on Yakuza, Yong-Yei likes them more than me, but I do understand

54
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,040
that Kiryu is the heart and soul of the series.

55
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,000
He's a beloved character in a beloved series that has spawned its share of high quality

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
memes.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,920
But right from the get-go there's a few red flags here.

58
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,040
Firstly, that whole 4 years ago I moved to LA thing, I've said it a few times on this

59
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,540
channel and I'll say it again.

60
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,760
If your favorite YouTuber or streamer decides the next big step in their career is to fly

61
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,240
out to LA and start making connections in the influencer space, pack it up.

62
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,700
It's time to find a new favorite because they're done son.

63
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,840
They might keep making money and growing, but the quality of their content is going

64
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,640
to rapidly decline as they start bending to the will of the connections they've made

65
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,920
and begin injecting the political views of the environment that they're in.

66
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,940
LA is a cesspool of insufferably smug progressive elitism, and from what I've heard from long

67
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,440
time viewers, Yong-Yei was no exception to the rule, he slid down this slope just like

68
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
everyone else.

69
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,760
Secondly, there's the quality of his voice.

70
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,320
Yong-Yei did a line reading at Anime Expo 2023, here's the clip

71
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:22,400
The fan backlash to this centered on how Yong-Yei's Kiryu voice sounds too much

72
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
like his own.

73
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,420
And considering that in the game that Yong-Yei is playing Kiryu, he's middle aged at this

74
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,720
point, yeah I agree, he's too young sounding to be the voice of a gray haired retired Kiryu.

75
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,540
Yong-Yei's response to this was to post the official clip of the line from the video

76
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,240
game on his twitter, as a way of saying no it's good guys, just listen to how it sounds

77
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
about the echoes of the panel.

78
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,440
But that received so much backlash he deleted the tweet.

79
00:04:43,440 --> 00:05:04,640
Here's the deleted video.

80
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,480
Yeah this still ain't great.

81
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,280
Somebody made a fan edit on YouTube, splicing in the Anime Expo audio overtop the in-game

82
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,840
cutscene.

83
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Hey, at least it's not as bad as the actual golem game buddy.

84
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,680
Yong-Yei's reply to the viral clip was to complain that it was misinformation, that

85
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,880
it was poorly recorded audio from an off the cuff panel and the script was unlocalized

86
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,760
and it was all superimposed into the Japanese trailer.

87
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,880
Many people even think it's official because of the video, but they hadn't even recorded

88
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,960
that scene yet.

89
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,640
You know, I thought that previous deleted clip was the official recording, but maybe

90
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,280
he just did it off the cuff for comparison sake.

91
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,480
Everyone had their doubts about this, but the game was still months off, maybe it wouldn't

92
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,480
be so bad.

93
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,960
And then when the game's demo dropped, everyone's doubts were confirmed.

94
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,400
This clip went viral with the attached tweet.

95
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,000
I just heard actual English Kiryu voice and uh, Yong-Yei as a casting choice fucking sucked,

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:29,120
I'm so sorry.

97
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,280
Here's Yong-Yei's official clip, tagged with did a side by side with the Japanese

98
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,840
for those wanting to hear the difference.

99
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,520
This is some of the first stuff we recorded a year ago.

100
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,720
The performance got more refined as we went further along.

101
00:06:39,720 --> 00:07:07,080
I'm excited for y'all to experience the full games.

102
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,760
This just isn't working man.

103
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,400
No offense to Yong-Yei himself, this isn't a personal attack on the man, but he was not

104
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,040
the right choice for this character.

105
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,400
There's a couple of things at play here.

106
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,240
Firstly is that the previous English voice actor for Kiryu, Daryl Kurilo, seems to be

107
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,480
a complete cuck.

108
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,280
His reaction to Yong-Yei swiping his job out from under him is, I am very happy and honored

109
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,560
to have played a wonderfully written and iconic character as Kiryu.

110
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,200
I am just as happy to discover that the role will be portrayed by a dedicated actor who

111
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,520
more closely matches Kiryu's culture.

112
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
I approve.

113
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,880
I gotta do a deep dive into this topic at some point, but there is this weird woke racial

114
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,000
segregationist movement happening in voice acting right now, where progressives in that

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,460
space are demanding that characters of a specific race can only be voice acted by actors who

116
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,640
share that race, so that they can embody the racial experiences or some other racist KKK

117
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
ass nonsense.

118
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,900
Secondly, is the more general rule of, don't hire YouTubers to be in your fucking video

119
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,300
games, it never ends well.

120
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,880
I know, I get it, you want to connect with the kids and get some of their money by attaching

121
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,800
that brand to your product, but it almost always makes it shittier.

122
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,520
You can count the number of career transitions into more traditional entertainment YouTubers

123
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,560
have made that have been successful and non-cringe on like, one hand.

124
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
We all know it's true.

125
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,340
You're sitting there, playing a video game or watching a show, and then suddenly you

126
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,800
hear Egoraptor's voice or Markiplier's or something, and you just want to shut it

127
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
off.

128
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,120
And it's not even necessarily because they're bad voice actors, though they usually are,

129
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,400
it's that even if they're good, they're still bringing with them that LA funk.

130
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,640
That progressive elitist clique that you and I will never be a part of.

131
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,680
Full of people who look down on us and hate the fact that they still need us to buy their

132
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
slop.

133
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,520
Anyway, after the repeated negative feedback, Yongye began to mass block people on Twitter

134
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
and hide replies.

135
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,940
I understand, man, you're not going to accept any criticism, you're going to stay the

136
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,520
course and drive this fucking thing right into the ground.

137
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,200
But you've got to understand, nobody, and I mean nobody, wants to hear your auto-tuned

138
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
voice sing these songs.

139
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:16,640
It got so bad that Yongye began to block his supporters who weren't perfectly marching

140
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,080
in lockstep with him.

141
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,120
Like for Tanga here, who said that Yongye was a bad Kiryu, but he shouldn't be cancel

142
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,520
cultured by people bringing up unrelated slur usage from years ago as an avenue of attack.

143
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,480
And he got his ass blocked for that.

144
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,260
Yongye is going full scorched earth, man.

145
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,000
This is all very hypocritical.

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,560
Because while he is blocking people who are just haters, who are saying stuff like you

147
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,400
suck or whatever, he's also blocking people who are making the reasonable obvious criticism

148
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,920
that Yongye is just not a good fit for the character of Kiryu.

149
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,960
A criticism that Yongye himself made against Chris Pratt voicing Mario in the Mario Brothers

150
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
movie.

151
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,980
Now the one thing that everyone's talking about is of course Mario's voice.

152
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,900
This is the main character, this is an iconic character, there's a very specific voice

153
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,300
and type of performance that we associate with Mario's character.

154
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,500
And this trailer finally gave us a glimpse of what Mario will sound like who is played

155
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,420
by Chris Pratt.

156
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,220
And I'll be honest, when I first watched this trailer, I was kind of disappointed.

157
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,340
I was a little taken aback by how much Mario just sounds like Chris Pratt doing like a

158
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,860
bit of a Brooklyn accent.

159
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,580
This still shot right here is a pretty appropriate representation of my reaction, that first

160
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,120
knee jerk impression.

161
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,160
This article dropped on The Gamer, Kazuma Kiryu's English voice was always going to

162
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,600
be impossible, making the point that Kiryu's voice and character and the story of the games

163
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,720
is quintessentially Japanese, translating them into English has never really worked,

164
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,500
and that it's not actually a problem with Yongye, whoever they chose was basically doomed

165
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
to failure from the get-go.

166
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,880
There's probably something to this view, I don't know anybody who plays Yakuza with

167
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,180
any language other than the Japanese, it certainly feels more authentic.

168
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,860
But before Yongye took over, the English dub of Yakuza was only considered superfluous

169
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,980
by the fans, not a direct sabotaging of the game.

170
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,320
It's true that no English voice actor can ever truly be Kiryu, but there are absolutely

171
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,480
people who come way closer than Yongye, and his inclusion really just feels like capitalizing

172
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,780
on YouTuber clout.

173
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,620
Moreover, Yongye actually has a history of doing this sort of thing whenever controversy

174
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,780
rears its ugly head.

175
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,820
He has a history of deleting videos and deleting comments, in order to try and control public

176
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,820
opinion of him.

177
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,160
A lot of these other stories never went viral, and they're lost to time because he was

178
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,920
just so good at scrubbing the online narrative, but you can still find crumbs here and there.

179
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,280
This isn't how you do it, man.

180
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,040
I mean, who am I to say that, I guess?

181
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
I've got 140,000 subs and he's got over a million.

182
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,640
But if you want to remain a good person, this isn't how you do it.

183
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,120
I've had takes that people didn't like, I've put out videos that people hated, I've

184
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,040
received more than my fair share of flak on the internet, I've had my mentions full

185
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,140
of thousands of replies, people telling me to kill myself or delete my channel, or insulting

186
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,240
my weight or insulting my girlfriend or whatever else, multiple times now, and I've never

187
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,400
gone on a mass-block delete spree.

188
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,900
I've never taken down videos or tweets for that.

189
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,980
You just carry on and hope people will come around, and if they don't, you try again

190
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,980
next time.

191
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,440
I think this is an Egoraptor-style story.

192
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,360
Despite all of Yangye's YouTube success, he always wanted to be an actor or a voice

193
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,080
actor, and he viewed YouTube as secondary, as the job he settled on doing rather than

194
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,320
the job he wanted.

195
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,960
And now that his YouTube channel is moving him into actor spaces, that's become his

196
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
personality.

197
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,880
That's why he says, I earned Kiryu, that's why his Twitter name is now the English voice

198
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,480
of Kiryu, and why he's posting videos on his channel saying, Kiryu auditions for Mario,

199
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,680
or Kiryu's voice actor reacts to trailers, or I met Kiryu, which is just his fans meeting

200
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,680
him.

201
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,740
Kiryu is Yangye's crown jewel, it doesn't matter how much he ruins the character and

202
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,040
destroys the franchise, it's a stepping stone in his career, and that's what he

203
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
cares about.

204
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,980
He can now put on his resume that he was the lead role in the multi-million-copy-selling

205
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,400
Yakuza series.

206
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,720
This isn't going to stop by the way, Yangye just announced that he's going to be voicing

207
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,080
a character in the Persona 3 remake, and he's probably going to rape that project

208
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,400
into the ground too.

209
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,720
Shitty nepotistic LA YouTubers are going to keep providing dogshit voice performances

210
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,200
in these games, as long as they're profitable.

211
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:10,920
