00:00.000 --> 00:10.560
Normally, when I talk about a topic that involves video games, or internet culture, or sometimes

00:10.560 --> 00:13.660
YouTuber drama, I'll make it into an indefensible video.

00:13.660 --> 00:18.240
You know, with that cool opening that everyone seems to like that goes doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo,

00:18.240 --> 00:19.240
you know that one?

00:19.240 --> 00:22.660
Where everyone in the comments says, OMG, Dev brought it back, whenever I make a new

00:22.660 --> 00:24.000
video in that series?

00:24.000 --> 00:27.180
Well, the Yong-Yei story does fit that bill.

00:27.180 --> 00:31.320
It's about video games, and internet culture, and YouTuber drama, but I don't actually

00:31.320 --> 00:34.220
think there's enough meat on this bone for a deep dive.

00:34.220 --> 00:37.780
There might not even be enough here for a full ten minutes, but I'll give it a try.

00:37.780 --> 00:42.900
Plus, the indefensible intro is, uh, constantly copyright struck, so hey, support the channel!

00:42.900 --> 00:47.260
Yong-Yei is a YouTuber who got his start back in January of 2012.

00:47.260 --> 00:50.780
Looking at his backlog, he did all sorts of things to try and get ahead in the YouTuber

00:50.780 --> 00:51.780
game back then.

00:51.780 --> 00:54.540
Let's plays, unboxings, reporting on gaming news.

00:54.540 --> 00:58.500
He eventually settled into making short videos, generally only a few minutes long, talking

00:58.500 --> 01:03.780
about minute updates a few select games were receiving, what the next Fallout 4 patch looked

01:03.780 --> 01:08.700
like, what new character was recently announced for Smash Bros on Wii U, that sort of thing.

01:08.700 --> 01:13.140
Gaming news is what he eventually settled into, talking about trade shows or award shows,

01:13.140 --> 01:16.500
talking about upcoming games, interviews with journalists or people in the industry.

01:16.500 --> 01:19.820
I never really watched him, but from what I checked out for this video, it was all good

01:19.820 --> 01:20.820
stuff.

01:20.820 --> 01:24.100
High quality for that era of YouTube still holds up today, and is probably why he has

01:24.660 --> 01:25.660
over a million subs now.

01:25.660 --> 01:29.380
I'll also just quickly say, whenever I do a video like this, looking into a YouTuber's

01:29.380 --> 01:32.220
past always feels like unearthing a time capsule, you know?

01:32.220 --> 01:36.060
For example, one of the oldest videos still surviving on the channel is his Let's Play

01:36.060 --> 01:40.500
of the Mass Effect 3 demo, from before Mass Effect 3 was released.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.860
That game is considered retro nowadays, but at the time the video was released, it was

01:43.860 --> 01:47.480
cutting edge, and the video is full of decade old comments of people clamoring about the

01:47.480 --> 01:48.480
game.

01:48.480 --> 01:53.580
Also, seeing young Yong-Yei, Yong-Yei I guess, do old style YouTube skits was just surreal

01:53.580 --> 01:54.580
to me.

01:54.580 --> 01:58.300
In modern times, Yong-Yei's channel has more or less stuck to the gaming news thing,

01:58.300 --> 02:03.600
though generally not as granular as discussing patch notes or updates for specific games.

02:03.600 --> 02:07.480
That YouTube trend was done best by TotalBiscuit, and it basically died with him.

02:07.480 --> 02:12.260
There still exist channels who do update videos or meta conversations about specific games,

02:12.260 --> 02:15.700
like Warcraft channels, or Hollow Knight channels, or Zelda channels, or Overwatch channels.

02:15.700 --> 02:19.560
But the reason that there are channels dedicated to specific game franchises, is because we've

02:19.560 --> 02:23.320
basically figured out at this point in the YouTube game, that interest in the minutiae

02:23.320 --> 02:27.520
of a specific patch for a specific game is a niche market, not something that really

02:27.520 --> 02:31.860
sits well on a general gaming news channel.

02:31.860 --> 02:36.260
But with this general gaming news thing, Yong-Yei's done pretty well for himself.

02:36.260 --> 02:39.560
And because this is a YouTuber we're talking about here, it was inevitable that he would

02:39.560 --> 02:42.720
eventually put his foot in his mouth, and then shoot it.

02:42.720 --> 02:47.640
RGG Studio announced that Yong-Yei was cast as the English voice actor of Kiryu from the

02:47.640 --> 02:49.600
Yakuza series of games.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.880
Here's Yong-Yei's own announcement.

02:50.880 --> 02:55.980
4 years ago I moved to LA with dreams of one day playing a AAA game protagonist, but

02:55.980 --> 02:58.560
I never imagined I'd land such a legendary role.

02:58.560 --> 03:02.400
It's the greatest honor of my life to announce I'm the English voice of the Dragon of Dojima,

03:02.400 --> 03:05.600
Kazuma Kiryu, in Yakuza Gaiden and 8.

03:05.600 --> 03:09.280
Now I'm only lukewarm on Yakuza, Yong-Yei likes them more than me, but I do understand

03:09.280 --> 03:12.040
that Kiryu is the heart and soul of the series.

03:12.040 --> 03:16.000
He's a beloved character in a beloved series that has spawned its share of high quality

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
memes.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.920
But right from the get-go there's a few red flags here.

03:18.920 --> 03:23.040
Firstly, that whole 4 years ago I moved to LA thing, I've said it a few times on this

03:23.040 --> 03:24.540
channel and I'll say it again.

03:24.540 --> 03:28.760
If your favorite YouTuber or streamer decides the next big step in their career is to fly

03:28.760 --> 03:32.240
out to LA and start making connections in the influencer space, pack it up.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.700
It's time to find a new favorite because they're done son.

03:34.700 --> 03:37.840
They might keep making money and growing, but the quality of their content is going

03:37.840 --> 03:41.640
to rapidly decline as they start bending to the will of the connections they've made

03:41.640 --> 03:44.920
and begin injecting the political views of the environment that they're in.

03:44.920 --> 03:49.940
LA is a cesspool of insufferably smug progressive elitism, and from what I've heard from long

03:49.940 --> 03:54.440
time viewers, Yong-Yei was no exception to the rule, he slid down this slope just like

03:54.440 --> 03:55.440
everyone else.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.760
Secondly, there's the quality of his voice.

03:57.760 --> 04:01.320
Yong-Yei did a line reading at Anime Expo 2023, here's the clip

04:14.920 --> 04:22.400
The fan backlash to this centered on how Yong-Yei's Kiryu voice sounds too much

04:22.400 --> 04:23.400
like his own.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.420
And considering that in the game that Yong-Yei is playing Kiryu, he's middle aged at this

04:26.420 --> 04:31.720
point, yeah I agree, he's too young sounding to be the voice of a gray haired retired Kiryu.

04:31.720 --> 04:35.540
Yong-Yei's response to this was to post the official clip of the line from the video

04:35.540 --> 04:39.240
game on his twitter, as a way of saying no it's good guys, just listen to how it sounds

04:39.240 --> 04:40.240
about the echoes of the panel.

04:40.240 --> 04:43.440
But that received so much backlash he deleted the tweet.

04:43.440 --> 05:04.640
Here's the deleted video.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.480
Yeah this still ain't great.

05:06.480 --> 05:11.280
Somebody made a fan edit on YouTube, splicing in the Anime Expo audio overtop the in-game

05:11.280 --> 05:15.840
cutscene.

05:15.840 --> 05:32.840
Hey, at least it's not as bad as the actual golem game buddy.

05:32.840 --> 05:36.680
Yong-Yei's reply to the viral clip was to complain that it was misinformation, that

05:36.680 --> 05:40.880
it was poorly recorded audio from an off the cuff panel and the script was unlocalized

05:40.880 --> 05:43.760
and it was all superimposed into the Japanese trailer.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.880
Many people even think it's official because of the video, but they hadn't even recorded

05:46.880 --> 05:47.960
that scene yet.

05:47.960 --> 05:51.640
You know, I thought that previous deleted clip was the official recording, but maybe

05:51.640 --> 05:54.280
he just did it off the cuff for comparison sake.

05:54.280 --> 05:57.480
Everyone had their doubts about this, but the game was still months off, maybe it wouldn't

05:57.480 --> 05:58.480
be so bad.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.960
And then when the game's demo dropped, everyone's doubts were confirmed.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.400
This clip went viral with the attached tweet.

06:04.400 --> 06:10.000
I just heard actual English Kiryu voice and uh, Yong-Yei as a casting choice fucking sucked,

06:10.000 --> 06:29.120
I'm so sorry.

06:29.120 --> 06:33.280
Here's Yong-Yei's official clip, tagged with did a side by side with the Japanese

06:33.280 --> 06:34.840
for those wanting to hear the difference.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.520
This is some of the first stuff we recorded a year ago.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.720
The performance got more refined as we went further along.

06:39.720 --> 07:07.080
I'm excited for y'all to experience the full games.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.760
This just isn't working man.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.400
No offense to Yong-Yei himself, this isn't a personal attack on the man, but he was not

07:12.400 --> 07:14.040
the right choice for this character.

07:14.040 --> 07:16.400
There's a couple of things at play here.

07:16.400 --> 07:20.240
Firstly is that the previous English voice actor for Kiryu, Daryl Kurilo, seems to be

07:20.240 --> 07:21.480
a complete cuck.

07:21.480 --> 07:26.280
His reaction to Yong-Yei swiping his job out from under him is, I am very happy and honored

07:26.280 --> 07:29.560
to have played a wonderfully written and iconic character as Kiryu.

07:29.560 --> 07:33.200
I am just as happy to discover that the role will be portrayed by a dedicated actor who

07:33.200 --> 07:35.520
more closely matches Kiryu's culture.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.520
I approve.

07:36.520 --> 07:40.880
I gotta do a deep dive into this topic at some point, but there is this weird woke racial

07:40.880 --> 07:45.000
segregationist movement happening in voice acting right now, where progressives in that

07:45.000 --> 07:49.460
space are demanding that characters of a specific race can only be voice acted by actors who

07:49.460 --> 07:54.640
share that race, so that they can embody the racial experiences or some other racist KKK

07:54.640 --> 07:55.640
ass nonsense.

07:55.640 --> 08:00.900
Secondly, is the more general rule of, don't hire YouTubers to be in your fucking video

08:00.900 --> 08:02.300
games, it never ends well.

08:02.300 --> 08:05.880
I know, I get it, you want to connect with the kids and get some of their money by attaching

08:05.880 --> 08:09.800
that brand to your product, but it almost always makes it shittier.

08:09.800 --> 08:13.520
You can count the number of career transitions into more traditional entertainment YouTubers

08:13.520 --> 08:17.560
have made that have been successful and non-cringe on like, one hand.

08:17.560 --> 08:18.560
We all know it's true.

08:18.560 --> 08:21.340
You're sitting there, playing a video game or watching a show, and then suddenly you

08:21.340 --> 08:24.800
hear Egoraptor's voice or Markiplier's or something, and you just want to shut it

08:24.800 --> 08:25.800
off.

08:25.800 --> 08:29.120
And it's not even necessarily because they're bad voice actors, though they usually are,

08:29.120 --> 08:33.400
it's that even if they're good, they're still bringing with them that LA funk.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.640
That progressive elitist clique that you and I will never be a part of.

08:36.640 --> 08:40.680
Full of people who look down on us and hate the fact that they still need us to buy their

08:40.680 --> 08:41.680
slop.

08:41.680 --> 08:46.520
Anyway, after the repeated negative feedback, Yongye began to mass block people on Twitter

08:46.520 --> 08:47.520
and hide replies.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.940
I understand, man, you're not going to accept any criticism, you're going to stay the

08:50.940 --> 08:53.520
course and drive this fucking thing right into the ground.

08:53.520 --> 08:58.200
But you've got to understand, nobody, and I mean nobody, wants to hear your auto-tuned

08:58.200 --> 09:00.200
voice sing these songs.

09:00.200 --> 09:16.640
It got so bad that Yongye began to block his supporters who weren't perfectly marching

09:16.640 --> 09:18.080
in lockstep with him.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.120
Like for Tanga here, who said that Yongye was a bad Kiryu, but he shouldn't be cancel

09:22.120 --> 09:27.520
cultured by people bringing up unrelated slur usage from years ago as an avenue of attack.

09:27.520 --> 09:29.480
And he got his ass blocked for that.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.260
Yongye is going full scorched earth, man.

09:31.260 --> 09:33.000
This is all very hypocritical.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.560
Because while he is blocking people who are just haters, who are saying stuff like you

09:36.560 --> 09:41.400
suck or whatever, he's also blocking people who are making the reasonable obvious criticism

09:41.400 --> 09:44.920
that Yongye is just not a good fit for the character of Kiryu.

09:44.920 --> 09:49.960
A criticism that Yongye himself made against Chris Pratt voicing Mario in the Mario Brothers

09:49.960 --> 09:50.960
movie.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.980
Now the one thing that everyone's talking about is of course Mario's voice.

09:53.980 --> 09:57.900
This is the main character, this is an iconic character, there's a very specific voice

09:57.900 --> 10:01.300
and type of performance that we associate with Mario's character.

10:01.300 --> 10:05.500
And this trailer finally gave us a glimpse of what Mario will sound like who is played

10:05.500 --> 10:07.420
by Chris Pratt.

10:07.420 --> 10:12.220
And I'll be honest, when I first watched this trailer, I was kind of disappointed.

10:12.220 --> 10:16.340
I was a little taken aback by how much Mario just sounds like Chris Pratt doing like a

10:16.340 --> 10:17.860
bit of a Brooklyn accent.

10:17.860 --> 10:22.580
This still shot right here is a pretty appropriate representation of my reaction, that first

10:22.580 --> 10:24.120
knee jerk impression.

10:24.120 --> 10:28.160
This article dropped on The Gamer, Kazuma Kiryu's English voice was always going to

10:28.160 --> 10:32.600
be impossible, making the point that Kiryu's voice and character and the story of the games

10:32.600 --> 10:36.720
is quintessentially Japanese, translating them into English has never really worked,

10:36.720 --> 10:40.500
and that it's not actually a problem with Yongye, whoever they chose was basically doomed

10:40.500 --> 10:41.500
to failure from the get-go.

10:41.500 --> 10:44.880
There's probably something to this view, I don't know anybody who plays Yakuza with

10:44.880 --> 10:48.180
any language other than the Japanese, it certainly feels more authentic.

10:48.180 --> 10:52.860
But before Yongye took over, the English dub of Yakuza was only considered superfluous

10:52.860 --> 10:55.980
by the fans, not a direct sabotaging of the game.

10:55.980 --> 11:00.320
It's true that no English voice actor can ever truly be Kiryu, but there are absolutely

11:00.320 --> 11:05.480
people who come way closer than Yongye, and his inclusion really just feels like capitalizing

11:05.480 --> 11:06.780
on YouTuber clout.

11:06.780 --> 11:11.620
Moreover, Yongye actually has a history of doing this sort of thing whenever controversy

11:11.620 --> 11:12.780
rears its ugly head.

11:12.780 --> 11:16.820
He has a history of deleting videos and deleting comments, in order to try and control public

11:16.820 --> 11:17.820
opinion of him.

11:17.820 --> 11:21.160
A lot of these other stories never went viral, and they're lost to time because he was

11:21.160 --> 11:25.920
just so good at scrubbing the online narrative, but you can still find crumbs here and there.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.280
This isn't how you do it, man.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.040
I mean, who am I to say that, I guess?

11:29.040 --> 11:31.040
I've got 140,000 subs and he's got over a million.

11:31.040 --> 11:34.640
But if you want to remain a good person, this isn't how you do it.

11:34.640 --> 11:38.120
I've had takes that people didn't like, I've put out videos that people hated, I've

11:38.120 --> 11:42.040
received more than my fair share of flak on the internet, I've had my mentions full

11:42.040 --> 11:46.140
of thousands of replies, people telling me to kill myself or delete my channel, or insulting

11:46.140 --> 11:50.240
my weight or insulting my girlfriend or whatever else, multiple times now, and I've never

11:50.240 --> 11:52.400
gone on a mass-block delete spree.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.900
I've never taken down videos or tweets for that.

11:54.900 --> 11:57.980
You just carry on and hope people will come around, and if they don't, you try again

11:57.980 --> 11:58.980
next time.

11:58.980 --> 12:01.440
I think this is an Egoraptor-style story.

12:01.440 --> 12:05.360
Despite all of Yangye's YouTube success, he always wanted to be an actor or a voice

12:05.360 --> 12:09.080
actor, and he viewed YouTube as secondary, as the job he settled on doing rather than

12:09.080 --> 12:10.320
the job he wanted.

12:10.320 --> 12:13.960
And now that his YouTube channel is moving him into actor spaces, that's become his

12:13.960 --> 12:14.960
personality.

12:14.960 --> 12:18.880
That's why he says, I earned Kiryu, that's why his Twitter name is now the English voice

12:18.880 --> 12:23.480
of Kiryu, and why he's posting videos on his channel saying, Kiryu auditions for Mario,

12:23.480 --> 12:28.680
or Kiryu's voice actor reacts to trailers, or I met Kiryu, which is just his fans meeting

12:28.680 --> 12:29.680
him.

12:29.680 --> 12:33.740
Kiryu is Yangye's crown jewel, it doesn't matter how much he ruins the character and

12:33.740 --> 12:37.040
destroys the franchise, it's a stepping stone in his career, and that's what he

12:37.040 --> 12:38.040
cares about.

12:38.040 --> 12:41.980
He can now put on his resume that he was the lead role in the multi-million-copy-selling
