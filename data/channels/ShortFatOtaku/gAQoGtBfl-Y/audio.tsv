0	22440	I'm back. I'm back. Kinda. Naomi brought home COVID from work. This is my third time having
22440	28320	it. Jesus. Maybe I should have gotten vaxxed after all. Her and I, we've both been sick
28320	33080	for like at least a week. Her longer than me. My editor Dave, he was sick for like two
33080	37680	or three days. He got vaccinated. So if you're out there doubting if the vaccine works, there's
37680	41360	a living experiment for you. And I've been hitting it with all the over-the-counter stuff
41360	45040	that I can. I hit it with Buckley's. Actually, I don't think Americans know what Buckley's
45040	49840	is. It's a Canadian medicine. I even had some Nyquil. And oh my god, I hate Nyquil at this
49840	55740	point. God. No more. But at least I didn't do this with it. Have you guys seen this?
55740	61020	Using Nyquil chicken? I've done this in the past and usually I use about, you know, four
61020	64580	thirds of the bottle. And if it's your first time doing this, you can get away with using
64580	68300	about a fifth. Season that Nyquil in there just at the right temperature. You're gonna
68300	72940	want to let it sit there and sizzle for about, you know, five to 30 minutes. Make sure you're
72940	76560	constantly flipping over the chicken. You don't want to give one side more attention
76560	84860	than the other. Sometimes this steam really makes you sleepy. Oh fuck. What you're looking
84860	90540	for is that blue color right there. Alright, then you can go ahead and turn it off. Ooh
90540	96700	yeah, that steam baby. Drain the unused right back into the Nyquil can just like so. And
96700	105300	boom, Nyquil chicken. My god. How, how fucking dumb do you have to be? This apparently actually
105300	110580	got its start over on 4chan. Like all other memes, they eventually go from the chans down
110580	117460	onto TikTok or onto 9gag or whatever, or whatever sites you kids use nowadays. Well,
117460	122740	when the Nyquil chicken challenge went viral, the internet was quick to point out that boiling
122740	128340	a medication can make it much more concentrated and change its properties in other ways. Even
128340	132680	if you don't eat the chicken, inhaling the medications vapors while cooking could cause
132680	137720	high levels of the drugs to enter your body. It could also hurt your lungs. And it got
137720	142940	to the point that the FDA had to issue a warning against a TikTok trend of kids cooking chicken
142940	148280	with Nyquil. And it's about at this point in the story that I realized I hate TikTok.
148280	152400	I hate TikTok trends. I think I even hate internet trends at this point, though I didn't
152400	157480	used to. Like what were the big deal internet challenges back in the day? You had like the,
157480	163200	you had the ice bucket challenge, you know, where people dump ice and water on their heads
163200	167240	and you had like videos of celebrities doing it and it was some kind of good charitable
167280	170620	cause. It was kind of goofy. It was kind of stupid, but everyone had a good laugh out
170620	175040	of it or stuff like Gangnam Style or the Harlem Shake. This is all just the challenges of
175040	180120	the past were just funny dances that you could do and take a video of and post them online.
180120	185040	There's a bunch of not safe for work type challenges where girls tried to do sexy poses
185040	189460	that are kind of unrealistic. Oh, there was that one, the one finger challenge that came
189460	194040	out of Japan where a girl has to like use one finger to block both her tits and her
194040	198600	vag using a mirror. You know, they get, they get a bit risque sometimes, but they were
198600	204960	ultimately still like safe challenges. They weren't like incredibly stupid. You know,
204960	209080	I know that I'm a child of the, of the two thousands. So I recall people watching jackass
209080	212840	and stuff and wanting to do like crazy jumps on their skateboards and they break their
212840	216240	legs or they jump off things and they hurt themselves. Like, yeah, okay. There, there
216240	222760	was stuff like that, but those always had at least a chance of success. If you land
222760	227520	with a jump, then you're a hero. What possible success is there in eating NyQuil chicken?
227520	231760	And it's not just NyQuil chicken. Online challenges have become like purely fucking
231760	235640	retarded. Remember the whole tide pod thing where you had zoomers who were eating tide
235640	240840	pods like tide pod challenge? Why? Why? Or the coronavirus challenge where you had people
240840	246200	licking toilet, like public toilet seats. Why? Are you that desperate to go viral? Maybe
246200	250520	I'm just getting too old for this shit, but like, fuck. Here's one challenge that I missed
250520	256160	from a 2021 called devious licks or a, or a diabolical lick as the, as the Wikipedia
256160	260700	page says, it was a viral TikTok challenge in which American middle or high school students
260700	266440	posted videos of themselves stealing, vandalizing or showing off one or more items they stole
266440	271120	in their school. They look at some of this shit. People stealing the fire alarms or stealing
271120	276200	the clocks out of their schools. This is wild. I mean, it's funny if I were still in school,
276200	281280	I'd be laughing like hell at this, but Jesus TikTok fame was leading people to do some
281280	288760	crazy stuff. This motherfucker stole a sign from subway. Look at this. Can you, can you
288760	296000	fucking imagine like your dad walks into the room, son, why is there a subway sign hanging
296000	302920	in your fucking bedroom? To be fair, you know, back in the day we're talking like the seventies
302920	306840	in the eighties, uh, kids would steal stop signs all the time. They'd take a stop sign
306840	311400	down from a, from a corner than paying up in their room. You know, I have, um, an older
311400	315520	cousin. I was, I was visiting his parents with my parents and he had since moved out,
315520	318280	but his stuff was still there and you had a stop sign and I was like, oh, that's cool.
318280	323100	You know, being like a seven year old. So this is not exactly unique to the zoomers,
323100	328640	but holy fuck. Here's the thing though. You can't actually find any of these videos anymore
328640	333520	because if you go to TikTok and search a devious licks, you get this page. There's
333520	341120	nothing here. There's no videos. There's a view resources. Assess challenges and warnings.
341120	349720	Stop. Yeah. So this trend got so big on TikTok and it was so illegal. TikTok had to be like,
349720	355960	no, you can't post this anymore. But Oh man, we haven't even started going down the rabbit
355960	373560	hole. Y'all remember this? The Holocaust TikTok challenge where girls would, would
373560	379080	dress up in makeup as Holocaust victims and pretend to be like talking from beyond the
379080	383560	grave. Like what the fuck? What could possibly be going through your head that you thought
383560	388800	this was a good idea. This is how you want to be known. Here's how I'll get internet
388800	395480	famous guys. I'll cosplay as Anne fucking Frank. But at least those people know that
395480	401380	they're playing a part. They're not actually spirits of reincarnated Holocaust victims
401380	407240	or something. This next group of people. Oh my God. Everyone that I'm about to show you,
407240	412280	they actually believe this stuff. It seems to be the case that every 10 year old alternative
412280	417400	or emo girl goes through a, you know, a, a wiccan phase. They're casting spells in
417400	421160	their, in their basement, hoping that their Christian parents don't notice. They grow
421160	424440	out of that when they hit high school, usually, you know, maybe when they hit college. But
424440	429160	uh, some of these people, they actually believe this shit and they have spell tutorials on
429160	435040	TikTok. You want to know how to cast your own black magic spells, Manifex manifesting
435040	443560	and magic. 350,000 fucking followers. Who are the, who are the absolute rubes? The idiots
443560	449440	who believe in this shit. Oh my God. An energy session. We gotta, we gotta see this.
465320	470080	It sounds like she's speaking Valerian from game of thrones. God, look at this stuff.
470080	473520	What is this? A sacred release. What the fuck is this?
481360	482360	Oh my God.
484360	489360	Yeah, this is me on a day one or day two of my coronavirus infection.
489360	495760	What we're currently watching are called light language frequencies,
497760	503600	where the guy is drastically humping the air because he really wants to fuck this chick.
511360	512720	This feels vaguely racist.
513120	520160	I don't know why, but this is how you do it guys. This is how you cure cancer, whatever
520160	526560	else it ails you. Just have some chick go over you and go, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me. This
526560	531680	bitch makes money doing this. This is a more useless job than mine. This one's doing like
531680	538320	tuning fork magic. 800,000 followers. What the fuck? How the fuck is this is what's popular on
538320	543760	the internet nowadays. Am I just an old man? Did I, did I miss, did I miss things? What's basically
543760	549520	going on here is as soon as the millennial hipster woman aged out of their twenties and became Karens,
549520	555200	their internet trends also changed to accommodate that new life status. Meet the modern hipster
555200	562320	witches making a fortune from casting spells. I'm in the wrong fucking profession dude. Fuck.
562320	568880	Georgia Burns and Harmony Nice, two young Wiccan witches. Like these were the girls that back in
568880	574480	high school you would hang out with them because they might not be quite as bitchy as the blondes
575280	579120	and you could get into their pants pretty easily just by like sharing some weed with them.
579920	586480	But now Jesus Christ, they're alternating between working in HR departments and getting you fired
586480	591600	during the day and then at night on TikTok they're doing shit like this. But it gets even crazier
591600	598160	dude. You think we're done? Allow me to introduce you to the hashtag shift talk. These are people,
599600	607840	these are people who believe that using magic spells you can find on TikTok, you can shift
607840	613840	towards alternate universes like like Berenstain, Berenstain kind of thing. You can jump between
613840	619360	realities where the world is just slightly different and you can inhabit a different self,
619360	623920	a different you that exists in that other reality. Why is it always white women doing
623920	627840	this shit man? Oh my god this chick looks like someone I went to high school with. I hope it's
627840	636080	not her. Part of the whole shift talk thing are these codes. You see these numbers? Look at this,
636080	645200	shifting realities. Shut up. Okay look cheat codes for manifestations. Write them down,
645200	650000	say them aloud, write them in the air. You can use this code to lucid dream, this code to shift
650000	655280	realities, this code for good health. You just write these numbers in the air. These are these
655280	661680	are zoomer cheat codes guys and if you put these codes down somewhere the universe will manifest
661680	666800	what you want. Look at this person, look at this person. The money one definitely works. My grandma
666800	671600	keeps giving me money for no reason. It's because she's your grandma dude. Now believe it or not
671600	678160	these codes actually have um a basis outside of TikTok and they're called Grabavoy codes
678800	684880	and if you search Grabavoy codes on TikTok you're gonna see oh my god how to use you what is this
684880	689600	like this dude is involved in it too are you are you that desperate buddy? But anyway how to use
689600	695120	the Grabavoy numbers all right and everyone's talking about Grabavoy numbers. Oh my god guys
695120	699600	here's how you hack the universe. What's actually going on here is that these Grabavoy codes that
699600	706000	zoomers are trying to input into reality. God I can't believe this is what we're doing today.
706000	712560	The Grabavoy codes were invented by mathematician Grigory Grabavoy who is from Russia. He was
712560	718160	convicted of fraud in 2008 for promising the parents of children killed in a school shooting
718160	724720	that he could resurrect their kids and it's basically just his old scam from 2008 given
724720	730000	new life on TikTok. Hopefully it's clear at this point that TikTok is full of retardation right?
730000	734160	Nothing of value is found on this fucking hell site and despite that I'm probably going to have
734160	738640	to start doing like SFO clips on there because it's the place where all the eyeballs are nowadays
738640	744480	and these are the people that the Biden administration is using to reach out
745760	750160	and hype the democrats accomplishments. These are the people these are the ones we're going
750160	755280	to outreach to the youth of today. I'm sure y'all remember this with this whoever the fuck this guy
755280	762400	is. One sec democracy's calling see you daddy bye. Hi my name is Cooper and this is a day in my life
762400	768080	as a white house intern. I'm just going to pause it I'm not going to make you watch the whole thing
768080	772800	Jesus Christ. This was cringy enough back back when it went viral we don't got to do it again
772800	778160	do we? Do you really want to see it? You can go find it again. Fuck I hated this video it was on
778160	784000	twitter everywhere when it went viral last year but it's not just this fella you have fashion
784000	791600	TikTokers like this right? Clearly she's just here to look good she gets hits for being hot putting
791600	797920	on pretty clothes you know there's I don't I don't consider this content I can just go fucking whack
797920	802640	off on pornhub I don't care about this shit right but for some reason everyone loves stuff like this
802640	810880	okay so she's uh clearly good looking and she has she has her thing going for her but the Biden
810880	816880	administration paid her to do this. Why is gas so expensive and why is the United States inflation
816880	822320	rate at a four-time decade high? I had the opportunity to ask the White House why gas down
822320	827440	the street is seven dollars and here's what they said the obvious reason we're getting out of a
827440	833200	two-year pandemic you know I don't I don't actually care to listen to all of the obviously fed
834000	838960	lines from the Biden White House that she's just reading off because there's no way that she is
838960	843760	intelligent enough to understand any of this shit that's happening but the point is why this chick
843760	849760	why are they getting thirst trap girls to do this it's just it reeks of desperation this is maybe
849760	855280	this is just me showing my age right but when I was younger going viral meant you hit like the
855280	859760	front page new grounds maybe maybe it meant you actually did something really interesting like
860320	866000	like the epic mealtime guys when they went viral back in like 2006 or 2007 whatever it was
866000	870800	they actually were making really cool interesting videos I mean they were ridiculous they were
870800	876000	eating like a hundred thousand calories of food but still it was it was actually a thing that was
876000	881440	happening it took effort it hadn't it took an idea and then them executing the idea even as
881440	887120	viral videos moved on from ridiculous feats and into things like stupid dances
887120	893120	or even just thirst traps like like the whole um the okay boomer girl nico lol right or the gorilla
893120	897360	glue girl who like just did dumb shit with her hair like I think that was kind of the moment
897360	904560	where it started to hit when we saw viral videos and tik tok trends and internet challenges
905120	911120	go from do this ridiculous thing that you're amazing if you pull off to
911760	917440	do this absolutely brain dead fucking loser thing it just makes everyone hate you and think that
917440	921840	you're a retard because after that we got shit like the tide pods and people licking ice cream
921840	927680	and putting it back into onto the shelves it just seems to me like the internet and going viral and
927680	935440	making content was a lot more interesting when it wasn't just pure fucking retards doing like the
935440	942640	most brain dead dumbest lowest denomination shit to desperately try and go viral back when it was
942640	947120	like produced videos or reviews or even just like let's plays and streams that's better than the
947120	952240	garbage we're seeing nowadays jesus tik tok and its consequences have been a disaster for the
952240	956560	human race i kind of wish that covid had fucking taken me finally
