1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,440
I'm back. I'm back. Kinda. Naomi brought home COVID from work. This is my third time having

2
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,320
it. Jesus. Maybe I should have gotten vaxxed after all. Her and I, we've both been sick

3
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,080
for like at least a week. Her longer than me. My editor Dave, he was sick for like two

4
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,680
or three days. He got vaccinated. So if you're out there doubting if the vaccine works, there's

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,360
a living experiment for you. And I've been hitting it with all the over-the-counter stuff

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,040
that I can. I hit it with Buckley's. Actually, I don't think Americans know what Buckley's

7
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,840
is. It's a Canadian medicine. I even had some Nyquil. And oh my god, I hate Nyquil at this

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,740
point. God. No more. But at least I didn't do this with it. Have you guys seen this?

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:01,020
Using Nyquil chicken? I've done this in the past and usually I use about, you know, four

10
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,580
thirds of the bottle. And if it's your first time doing this, you can get away with using

11
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,300
about a fifth. Season that Nyquil in there just at the right temperature. You're gonna

12
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,940
want to let it sit there and sizzle for about, you know, five to 30 minutes. Make sure you're

13
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,560
constantly flipping over the chicken. You don't want to give one side more attention

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,860
than the other. Sometimes this steam really makes you sleepy. Oh fuck. What you're looking

15
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:30,540
for is that blue color right there. Alright, then you can go ahead and turn it off. Ooh

16
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,700
yeah, that steam baby. Drain the unused right back into the Nyquil can just like so. And

17
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:45,300
boom, Nyquil chicken. My god. How, how fucking dumb do you have to be? This apparently actually

18
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,580
got its start over on 4chan. Like all other memes, they eventually go from the chans down

19
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:57,460
onto TikTok or onto 9gag or whatever, or whatever sites you kids use nowadays. Well,

20
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,740
when the Nyquil chicken challenge went viral, the internet was quick to point out that boiling

21
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:08,340
a medication can make it much more concentrated and change its properties in other ways. Even

22
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,680
if you don't eat the chicken, inhaling the medications vapors while cooking could cause

23
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,720
high levels of the drugs to enter your body. It could also hurt your lungs. And it got

24
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,940
to the point that the FDA had to issue a warning against a TikTok trend of kids cooking chicken

25
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,280
with Nyquil. And it's about at this point in the story that I realized I hate TikTok.

26
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,400
I hate TikTok trends. I think I even hate internet trends at this point, though I didn't

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,480
used to. Like what were the big deal internet challenges back in the day? You had like the,

28
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,200
you had the ice bucket challenge, you know, where people dump ice and water on their heads

29
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,240
and you had like videos of celebrities doing it and it was some kind of good charitable

30
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,620
cause. It was kind of goofy. It was kind of stupid, but everyone had a good laugh out

31
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,040
of it or stuff like Gangnam Style or the Harlem Shake. This is all just the challenges of

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,120
the past were just funny dances that you could do and take a video of and post them online.

33
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,040
There's a bunch of not safe for work type challenges where girls tried to do sexy poses

34
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,460
that are kind of unrealistic. Oh, there was that one, the one finger challenge that came

35
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:14,040
out of Japan where a girl has to like use one finger to block both her tits and her

36
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,600
vag using a mirror. You know, they get, they get a bit risque sometimes, but they were

37
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,960
ultimately still like safe challenges. They weren't like incredibly stupid. You know,

38
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,080
I know that I'm a child of the, of the two thousands. So I recall people watching jackass

39
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,840
and stuff and wanting to do like crazy jumps on their skateboards and they break their

40
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,240
legs or they jump off things and they hurt themselves. Like, yeah, okay. There, there

41
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:42,760
was stuff like that, but those always had at least a chance of success. If you land

42
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,520
with a jump, then you're a hero. What possible success is there in eating NyQuil chicken?

43
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,760
And it's not just NyQuil chicken. Online challenges have become like purely fucking

44
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,640
retarded. Remember the whole tide pod thing where you had zoomers who were eating tide

45
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,840
pods like tide pod challenge? Why? Why? Or the coronavirus challenge where you had people

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,200
licking toilet, like public toilet seats. Why? Are you that desperate to go viral? Maybe

47
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,520
I'm just getting too old for this shit, but like, fuck. Here's one challenge that I missed

48
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:16,160
from a 2021 called devious licks or a, or a diabolical lick as the, as the Wikipedia

49
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,700
page says, it was a viral TikTok challenge in which American middle or high school students

50
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:26,440
posted videos of themselves stealing, vandalizing or showing off one or more items they stole

51
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,120
in their school. They look at some of this shit. People stealing the fire alarms or stealing

52
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,200
the clocks out of their schools. This is wild. I mean, it's funny if I were still in school,

53
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,280
I'd be laughing like hell at this, but Jesus TikTok fame was leading people to do some

54
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,760
crazy stuff. This motherfucker stole a sign from subway. Look at this. Can you, can you

55
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:56,000
fucking imagine like your dad walks into the room, son, why is there a subway sign hanging

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,920
in your fucking bedroom? To be fair, you know, back in the day we're talking like the seventies

57
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,840
in the eighties, uh, kids would steal stop signs all the time. They'd take a stop sign

58
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,400
down from a, from a corner than paying up in their room. You know, I have, um, an older

59
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,520
cousin. I was, I was visiting his parents with my parents and he had since moved out,

60
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,280
but his stuff was still there and you had a stop sign and I was like, oh, that's cool.

61
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,100
You know, being like a seven year old. So this is not exactly unique to the zoomers,

62
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,640
but holy fuck. Here's the thing though. You can't actually find any of these videos anymore

63
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,520
because if you go to TikTok and search a devious licks, you get this page. There's

64
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:41,120
nothing here. There's no videos. There's a view resources. Assess challenges and warnings.

65
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:49,720
Stop. Yeah. So this trend got so big on TikTok and it was so illegal. TikTok had to be like,

66
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,960
no, you can't post this anymore. But Oh man, we haven't even started going down the rabbit

67
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:13,560
hole. Y'all remember this? The Holocaust TikTok challenge where girls would, would

68
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,080
dress up in makeup as Holocaust victims and pretend to be like talking from beyond the

69
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,560
grave. Like what the fuck? What could possibly be going through your head that you thought

70
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,800
this was a good idea. This is how you want to be known. Here's how I'll get internet

71
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,480
famous guys. I'll cosplay as Anne fucking Frank. But at least those people know that

72
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:41,380
they're playing a part. They're not actually spirits of reincarnated Holocaust victims

73
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:47,240
or something. This next group of people. Oh my God. Everyone that I'm about to show you,

74
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,280
they actually believe this stuff. It seems to be the case that every 10 year old alternative

75
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,400
or emo girl goes through a, you know, a, a wiccan phase. They're casting spells in

76
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,160
their, in their basement, hoping that their Christian parents don't notice. They grow

77
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,440
out of that when they hit high school, usually, you know, maybe when they hit college. But

78
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,160
uh, some of these people, they actually believe this shit and they have spell tutorials on

79
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:15,040
TikTok. You want to know how to cast your own black magic spells, Manifex manifesting

80
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:23,560
and magic. 350,000 fucking followers. Who are the, who are the absolute rubes? The idiots

81
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,440
who believe in this shit. Oh my God. An energy session. We gotta, we gotta see this.

82
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,080
It sounds like she's speaking Valerian from game of thrones. God, look at this stuff.

83
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,520
What is this? A sacred release. What the fuck is this?

84
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
Oh my God.

85
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Yeah, this is me on a day one or day two of my coronavirus infection.

86
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,760
What we're currently watching are called light language frequencies,

87
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,600
where the guy is drastically humping the air because he really wants to fuck this chick.

88
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,720
This feels vaguely racist.

89
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:40,160
I don't know why, but this is how you do it guys. This is how you cure cancer, whatever

90
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,560
else it ails you. Just have some chick go over you and go, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me. This

91
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,680
bitch makes money doing this. This is a more useless job than mine. This one's doing like

92
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,320
tuning fork magic. 800,000 followers. What the fuck? How the fuck is this is what's popular on

93
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,760
the internet nowadays. Am I just an old man? Did I, did I miss, did I miss things? What's basically

94
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,520
going on here is as soon as the millennial hipster woman aged out of their twenties and became Karens,

95
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:15,200
their internet trends also changed to accommodate that new life status. Meet the modern hipster

96
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:22,320
witches making a fortune from casting spells. I'm in the wrong fucking profession dude. Fuck.

97
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,880
Georgia Burns and Harmony Nice, two young Wiccan witches. Like these were the girls that back in

98
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,480
high school you would hang out with them because they might not be quite as bitchy as the blondes

99
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,120
and you could get into their pants pretty easily just by like sharing some weed with them.

100
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,480
But now Jesus Christ, they're alternating between working in HR departments and getting you fired

101
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,600
during the day and then at night on TikTok they're doing shit like this. But it gets even crazier

102
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,160
dude. You think we're done? Allow me to introduce you to the hashtag shift talk. These are people,

103
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:07,840
these are people who believe that using magic spells you can find on TikTok, you can shift

104
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,840
towards alternate universes like like Berenstain, Berenstain kind of thing. You can jump between

105
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,360
realities where the world is just slightly different and you can inhabit a different self,

106
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,920
a different you that exists in that other reality. Why is it always white women doing

107
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,840
this shit man? Oh my god this chick looks like someone I went to high school with. I hope it's

108
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:36,080
not her. Part of the whole shift talk thing are these codes. You see these numbers? Look at this,

109
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:45,200
shifting realities. Shut up. Okay look cheat codes for manifestations. Write them down,

110
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,000
say them aloud, write them in the air. You can use this code to lucid dream, this code to shift

111
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,280
realities, this code for good health. You just write these numbers in the air. These are these

112
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:01,680
are zoomer cheat codes guys and if you put these codes down somewhere the universe will manifest

113
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,800
what you want. Look at this person, look at this person. The money one definitely works. My grandma

114
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,600
keeps giving me money for no reason. It's because she's your grandma dude. Now believe it or not

115
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,160
these codes actually have um a basis outside of TikTok and they're called Grabavoy codes

116
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,880
and if you search Grabavoy codes on TikTok you're gonna see oh my god how to use you what is this

117
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,600
like this dude is involved in it too are you are you that desperate buddy? But anyway how to use

118
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,120
the Grabavoy numbers all right and everyone's talking about Grabavoy numbers. Oh my god guys

119
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,600
here's how you hack the universe. What's actually going on here is that these Grabavoy codes that

120
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,000
zoomers are trying to input into reality. God I can't believe this is what we're doing today.

121
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,560
The Grabavoy codes were invented by mathematician Grigory Grabavoy who is from Russia. He was

122
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,160
convicted of fraud in 2008 for promising the parents of children killed in a school shooting

123
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,720
that he could resurrect their kids and it's basically just his old scam from 2008 given

124
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,000
new life on TikTok. Hopefully it's clear at this point that TikTok is full of retardation right?

125
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,160
Nothing of value is found on this fucking hell site and despite that I'm probably going to have

126
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,640
to start doing like SFO clips on there because it's the place where all the eyeballs are nowadays

127
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,480
and these are the people that the Biden administration is using to reach out

128
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,160
and hype the democrats accomplishments. These are the people these are the ones we're going

129
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,280
to outreach to the youth of today. I'm sure y'all remember this with this whoever the fuck this guy

130
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:42,400
is. One sec democracy's calling see you daddy bye. Hi my name is Cooper and this is a day in my life

131
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:48,080
as a white house intern. I'm just going to pause it I'm not going to make you watch the whole thing

132
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,800
Jesus Christ. This was cringy enough back back when it went viral we don't got to do it again

133
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,160
do we? Do you really want to see it? You can go find it again. Fuck I hated this video it was on

134
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,000
twitter everywhere when it went viral last year but it's not just this fella you have fashion

135
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,600
TikTokers like this right? Clearly she's just here to look good she gets hits for being hot putting

136
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,920
on pretty clothes you know there's I don't I don't consider this content I can just go fucking whack

137
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,640
off on pornhub I don't care about this shit right but for some reason everyone loves stuff like this

138
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:30,880
okay so she's uh clearly good looking and she has she has her thing going for her but the Biden

139
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,880
administration paid her to do this. Why is gas so expensive and why is the United States inflation

140
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,320
rate at a four-time decade high? I had the opportunity to ask the White House why gas down

141
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,440
the street is seven dollars and here's what they said the obvious reason we're getting out of a

142
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,200
two-year pandemic you know I don't I don't actually care to listen to all of the obviously fed

143
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,960
lines from the Biden White House that she's just reading off because there's no way that she is

144
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,760
intelligent enough to understand any of this shit that's happening but the point is why this chick

145
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,760
why are they getting thirst trap girls to do this it's just it reeks of desperation this is maybe

146
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,280
this is just me showing my age right but when I was younger going viral meant you hit like the

147
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,760
front page new grounds maybe maybe it meant you actually did something really interesting like

148
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,000
like the epic mealtime guys when they went viral back in like 2006 or 2007 whatever it was

149
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,800
they actually were making really cool interesting videos I mean they were ridiculous they were

150
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,000
eating like a hundred thousand calories of food but still it was it was actually a thing that was

151
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,440
happening it took effort it hadn't it took an idea and then them executing the idea even as

152
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,120
viral videos moved on from ridiculous feats and into things like stupid dances

153
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:53,120
or even just thirst traps like like the whole um the okay boomer girl nico lol right or the gorilla

154
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,360
glue girl who like just did dumb shit with her hair like I think that was kind of the moment

155
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:04,560
where it started to hit when we saw viral videos and tik tok trends and internet challenges

156
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,120
go from do this ridiculous thing that you're amazing if you pull off to

157
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,440
do this absolutely brain dead fucking loser thing it just makes everyone hate you and think that

158
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,840
you're a retard because after that we got shit like the tide pods and people licking ice cream

159
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,680
and putting it back into onto the shelves it just seems to me like the internet and going viral and

160
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:35,440
making content was a lot more interesting when it wasn't just pure fucking retards doing like the

161
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:42,640
most brain dead dumbest lowest denomination shit to desperately try and go viral back when it was

162
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,120
like produced videos or reviews or even just like let's plays and streams that's better than the

163
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,240
garbage we're seeing nowadays jesus tik tok and its consequences have been a disaster for the

164
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,560
human race i kind of wish that covid had fucking taken me finally
