WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:22.440
I'm back. I'm back. Kinda. Naomi brought home COVID from work. This is my third time having

00:22.440 --> 00:28.320
it. Jesus. Maybe I should have gotten vaxxed after all. Her and I, we've both been sick

00:28.320 --> 00:33.080
for like at least a week. Her longer than me. My editor Dave, he was sick for like two

00:33.080 --> 00:37.680
or three days. He got vaccinated. So if you're out there doubting if the vaccine works, there's

00:37.680 --> 00:41.360
a living experiment for you. And I've been hitting it with all the over-the-counter stuff

00:41.360 --> 00:45.040
that I can. I hit it with Buckley's. Actually, I don't think Americans know what Buckley's

00:45.040 --> 00:49.840
is. It's a Canadian medicine. I even had some Nyquil. And oh my god, I hate Nyquil at this

00:49.840 --> 00:55.740
point. God. No more. But at least I didn't do this with it. Have you guys seen this?

00:55.740 --> 01:01.020
Using Nyquil chicken? I've done this in the past and usually I use about, you know, four

01:01.020 --> 01:04.580
thirds of the bottle. And if it's your first time doing this, you can get away with using

01:04.580 --> 01:08.300
about a fifth. Season that Nyquil in there just at the right temperature. You're gonna

01:08.300 --> 01:12.940
want to let it sit there and sizzle for about, you know, five to 30 minutes. Make sure you're

01:12.940 --> 01:16.560
constantly flipping over the chicken. You don't want to give one side more attention

01:16.560 --> 01:24.860
than the other. Sometimes this steam really makes you sleepy. Oh fuck. What you're looking

01:24.860 --> 01:30.540
for is that blue color right there. Alright, then you can go ahead and turn it off. Ooh

01:30.540 --> 01:36.700
yeah, that steam baby. Drain the unused right back into the Nyquil can just like so. And

01:36.700 --> 01:45.300
boom, Nyquil chicken. My god. How, how fucking dumb do you have to be? This apparently actually

01:45.300 --> 01:50.580
got its start over on 4chan. Like all other memes, they eventually go from the chans down

01:50.580 --> 01:57.460
onto TikTok or onto 9gag or whatever, or whatever sites you kids use nowadays. Well,

01:57.460 --> 02:02.740
when the Nyquil chicken challenge went viral, the internet was quick to point out that boiling

02:02.740 --> 02:08.340
a medication can make it much more concentrated and change its properties in other ways. Even

02:08.340 --> 02:12.680
if you don't eat the chicken, inhaling the medications vapors while cooking could cause

02:12.680 --> 02:17.720
high levels of the drugs to enter your body. It could also hurt your lungs. And it got

02:17.720 --> 02:22.940
to the point that the FDA had to issue a warning against a TikTok trend of kids cooking chicken

02:22.940 --> 02:28.280
with Nyquil. And it's about at this point in the story that I realized I hate TikTok.

02:28.280 --> 02:32.400
I hate TikTok trends. I think I even hate internet trends at this point, though I didn't

02:32.400 --> 02:37.480
used to. Like what were the big deal internet challenges back in the day? You had like the,

02:37.480 --> 02:43.200
you had the ice bucket challenge, you know, where people dump ice and water on their heads

02:43.200 --> 02:47.240
and you had like videos of celebrities doing it and it was some kind of good charitable

02:47.280 --> 02:50.620
cause. It was kind of goofy. It was kind of stupid, but everyone had a good laugh out

02:50.620 --> 02:55.040
of it or stuff like Gangnam Style or the Harlem Shake. This is all just the challenges of

02:55.040 --> 03:00.120
the past were just funny dances that you could do and take a video of and post them online.

03:00.120 --> 03:05.040
There's a bunch of not safe for work type challenges where girls tried to do sexy poses

03:05.040 --> 03:09.460
that are kind of unrealistic. Oh, there was that one, the one finger challenge that came

03:09.460 --> 03:14.040
out of Japan where a girl has to like use one finger to block both her tits and her

03:14.040 --> 03:18.600
vag using a mirror. You know, they get, they get a bit risque sometimes, but they were

03:18.600 --> 03:24.960
ultimately still like safe challenges. They weren't like incredibly stupid. You know,

03:24.960 --> 03:29.080
I know that I'm a child of the, of the two thousands. So I recall people watching jackass

03:29.080 --> 03:32.840
and stuff and wanting to do like crazy jumps on their skateboards and they break their

03:32.840 --> 03:36.240
legs or they jump off things and they hurt themselves. Like, yeah, okay. There, there

03:36.240 --> 03:42.760
was stuff like that, but those always had at least a chance of success. If you land

03:42.760 --> 03:47.520
with a jump, then you're a hero. What possible success is there in eating NyQuil chicken?

03:47.520 --> 03:51.760
And it's not just NyQuil chicken. Online challenges have become like purely fucking

03:51.760 --> 03:55.640
retarded. Remember the whole tide pod thing where you had zoomers who were eating tide

03:55.640 --> 04:00.840
pods like tide pod challenge? Why? Why? Or the coronavirus challenge where you had people

04:00.840 --> 04:06.200
licking toilet, like public toilet seats. Why? Are you that desperate to go viral? Maybe

04:06.200 --> 04:10.520
I'm just getting too old for this shit, but like, fuck. Here's one challenge that I missed

04:10.520 --> 04:16.160
from a 2021 called devious licks or a, or a diabolical lick as the, as the Wikipedia

04:16.160 --> 04:20.700
page says, it was a viral TikTok challenge in which American middle or high school students

04:20.700 --> 04:26.440
posted videos of themselves stealing, vandalizing or showing off one or more items they stole

04:26.440 --> 04:31.120
in their school. They look at some of this shit. People stealing the fire alarms or stealing

04:31.120 --> 04:36.200
the clocks out of their schools. This is wild. I mean, it's funny if I were still in school,

04:36.200 --> 04:41.280
I'd be laughing like hell at this, but Jesus TikTok fame was leading people to do some

04:41.280 --> 04:48.760
crazy stuff. This motherfucker stole a sign from subway. Look at this. Can you, can you

04:48.760 --> 04:56.000
fucking imagine like your dad walks into the room, son, why is there a subway sign hanging

04:56.000 --> 05:02.920
in your fucking bedroom? To be fair, you know, back in the day we're talking like the seventies

05:02.920 --> 05:06.840
in the eighties, uh, kids would steal stop signs all the time. They'd take a stop sign

05:06.840 --> 05:11.400
down from a, from a corner than paying up in their room. You know, I have, um, an older

05:11.400 --> 05:15.520
cousin. I was, I was visiting his parents with my parents and he had since moved out,

05:15.520 --> 05:18.280
but his stuff was still there and you had a stop sign and I was like, oh, that's cool.

05:18.280 --> 05:23.100
You know, being like a seven year old. So this is not exactly unique to the zoomers,

05:23.100 --> 05:28.640
but holy fuck. Here's the thing though. You can't actually find any of these videos anymore

05:28.640 --> 05:33.520
because if you go to TikTok and search a devious licks, you get this page. There's

05:33.520 --> 05:41.120
nothing here. There's no videos. There's a view resources. Assess challenges and warnings.

05:41.120 --> 05:49.720
Stop. Yeah. So this trend got so big on TikTok and it was so illegal. TikTok had to be like,

05:49.720 --> 05:55.960
no, you can't post this anymore. But Oh man, we haven't even started going down the rabbit

05:55.960 --> 06:13.560
hole. Y'all remember this? The Holocaust TikTok challenge where girls would, would

06:13.560 --> 06:19.080
dress up in makeup as Holocaust victims and pretend to be like talking from beyond the

06:19.080 --> 06:23.560
grave. Like what the fuck? What could possibly be going through your head that you thought

06:23.560 --> 06:28.800
this was a good idea. This is how you want to be known. Here's how I'll get internet

06:28.800 --> 06:35.480
famous guys. I'll cosplay as Anne fucking Frank. But at least those people know that

06:35.480 --> 06:41.380
they're playing a part. They're not actually spirits of reincarnated Holocaust victims

06:41.380 --> 06:47.240
or something. This next group of people. Oh my God. Everyone that I'm about to show you,

06:47.240 --> 06:52.280
they actually believe this stuff. It seems to be the case that every 10 year old alternative

06:52.280 --> 06:57.400
or emo girl goes through a, you know, a, a wiccan phase. They're casting spells in

06:57.400 --> 07:01.160
their, in their basement, hoping that their Christian parents don't notice. They grow

07:01.160 --> 07:04.440
out of that when they hit high school, usually, you know, maybe when they hit college. But

07:04.440 --> 07:09.160
uh, some of these people, they actually believe this shit and they have spell tutorials on

07:09.160 --> 07:15.040
TikTok. You want to know how to cast your own black magic spells, Manifex manifesting

07:15.040 --> 07:23.560
and magic. 350,000 fucking followers. Who are the, who are the absolute rubes? The idiots

07:23.560 --> 07:29.440
who believe in this shit. Oh my God. An energy session. We gotta, we gotta see this.

07:45.320 --> 07:50.080
It sounds like she's speaking Valerian from game of thrones. God, look at this stuff.

07:50.080 --> 07:53.520
What is this? A sacred release. What the fuck is this?

08:01.360 --> 08:02.360
Oh my God.

08:04.360 --> 08:09.360
Yeah, this is me on a day one or day two of my coronavirus infection.

08:09.360 --> 08:15.760
What we're currently watching are called light language frequencies,

08:17.760 --> 08:23.600
where the guy is drastically humping the air because he really wants to fuck this chick.

08:31.360 --> 08:32.720
This feels vaguely racist.

08:33.120 --> 08:40.160
I don't know why, but this is how you do it guys. This is how you cure cancer, whatever

08:40.160 --> 08:46.560
else it ails you. Just have some chick go over you and go, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me. This

08:46.560 --> 08:51.680
bitch makes money doing this. This is a more useless job than mine. This one's doing like

08:51.680 --> 08:58.320
tuning fork magic. 800,000 followers. What the fuck? How the fuck is this is what's popular on

08:58.320 --> 09:03.760
the internet nowadays. Am I just an old man? Did I, did I miss, did I miss things? What's basically

09:03.760 --> 09:09.520
going on here is as soon as the millennial hipster woman aged out of their twenties and became Karens,

09:09.520 --> 09:15.200
their internet trends also changed to accommodate that new life status. Meet the modern hipster

09:15.200 --> 09:22.320
witches making a fortune from casting spells. I'm in the wrong fucking profession dude. Fuck.

09:22.320 --> 09:28.880
Georgia Burns and Harmony Nice, two young Wiccan witches. Like these were the girls that back in

09:28.880 --> 09:34.480
high school you would hang out with them because they might not be quite as bitchy as the blondes

09:35.280 --> 09:39.120
and you could get into their pants pretty easily just by like sharing some weed with them.

09:39.920 --> 09:46.480
But now Jesus Christ, they're alternating between working in HR departments and getting you fired

09:46.480 --> 09:51.600
during the day and then at night on TikTok they're doing shit like this. But it gets even crazier

09:51.600 --> 09:58.160
dude. You think we're done? Allow me to introduce you to the hashtag shift talk. These are people,

09:59.600 --> 10:07.840
these are people who believe that using magic spells you can find on TikTok, you can shift

10:07.840 --> 10:13.840
towards alternate universes like like Berenstain, Berenstain kind of thing. You can jump between

10:13.840 --> 10:19.360
realities where the world is just slightly different and you can inhabit a different self,

10:19.360 --> 10:23.920
a different you that exists in that other reality. Why is it always white women doing

10:23.920 --> 10:27.840
this shit man? Oh my god this chick looks like someone I went to high school with. I hope it's

10:27.840 --> 10:36.080
not her. Part of the whole shift talk thing are these codes. You see these numbers? Look at this,

10:36.080 --> 10:45.200
shifting realities. Shut up. Okay look cheat codes for manifestations. Write them down,

10:45.200 --> 10:50.000
say them aloud, write them in the air. You can use this code to lucid dream, this code to shift

10:50.000 --> 10:55.280
realities, this code for good health. You just write these numbers in the air. These are these

10:55.280 --> 11:01.680
are zoomer cheat codes guys and if you put these codes down somewhere the universe will manifest

11:01.680 --> 11:06.800
what you want. Look at this person, look at this person. The money one definitely works. My grandma

11:06.800 --> 11:11.600
keeps giving me money for no reason. It's because she's your grandma dude. Now believe it or not

11:11.600 --> 11:18.160
these codes actually have um a basis outside of TikTok and they're called Grabavoy codes

11:18.800 --> 11:24.880
and if you search Grabavoy codes on TikTok you're gonna see oh my god how to use you what is this

11:24.880 --> 11:29.600
like this dude is involved in it too are you are you that desperate buddy? But anyway how to use

11:29.600 --> 11:35.120
the Grabavoy numbers all right and everyone's talking about Grabavoy numbers. Oh my god guys

11:35.120 --> 11:39.600
here's how you hack the universe. What's actually going on here is that these Grabavoy codes that

11:39.600 --> 11:46.000
zoomers are trying to input into reality. God I can't believe this is what we're doing today.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.560
The Grabavoy codes were invented by mathematician Grigory Grabavoy who is from Russia. He was

11:52.560 --> 11:58.160
convicted of fraud in 2008 for promising the parents of children killed in a school shooting

11:58.160 --> 12:04.720
that he could resurrect their kids and it's basically just his old scam from 2008 given

12:04.720 --> 12:10.000
new life on TikTok. Hopefully it's clear at this point that TikTok is full of retardation right?

12:10.000 --> 12:14.160
Nothing of value is found on this fucking hell site and despite that I'm probably going to have

12:14.160 --> 12:18.640
to start doing like SFO clips on there because it's the place where all the eyeballs are nowadays

12:18.640 --> 12:24.480
and these are the people that the Biden administration is using to reach out

12:25.760 --> 12:30.160
and hype the democrats accomplishments. These are the people these are the ones we're going

12:30.160 --> 12:35.280
to outreach to the youth of today. I'm sure y'all remember this with this whoever the fuck this guy

12:35.280 --> 12:42.400
is. One sec democracy's calling see you daddy bye. Hi my name is Cooper and this is a day in my life

12:42.400 --> 12:48.080
as a white house intern. I'm just going to pause it I'm not going to make you watch the whole thing

12:48.080 --> 12:52.800
Jesus Christ. This was cringy enough back back when it went viral we don't got to do it again

12:52.800 --> 12:58.160
do we? Do you really want to see it? You can go find it again. Fuck I hated this video it was on

12:58.160 --> 13:04.000
twitter everywhere when it went viral last year but it's not just this fella you have fashion

13:04.000 --> 13:11.600
TikTokers like this right? Clearly she's just here to look good she gets hits for being hot putting

13:11.600 --> 13:17.920
on pretty clothes you know there's I don't I don't consider this content I can just go fucking whack

13:17.920 --> 13:22.640
off on pornhub I don't care about this shit right but for some reason everyone loves stuff like this

13:22.640 --> 13:30.880
okay so she's uh clearly good looking and she has she has her thing going for her but the Biden

13:30.880 --> 13:36.880
administration paid her to do this. Why is gas so expensive and why is the United States inflation

13:36.880 --> 13:42.320
rate at a four-time decade high? I had the opportunity to ask the White House why gas down

13:42.320 --> 13:47.440
the street is seven dollars and here's what they said the obvious reason we're getting out of a

13:47.440 --> 13:53.200
two-year pandemic you know I don't I don't actually care to listen to all of the obviously fed

13:54.000 --> 13:58.960
lines from the Biden White House that she's just reading off because there's no way that she is

13:58.960 --> 14:03.760
intelligent enough to understand any of this shit that's happening but the point is why this chick

14:03.760 --> 14:09.760
why are they getting thirst trap girls to do this it's just it reeks of desperation this is maybe

14:09.760 --> 14:15.280
this is just me showing my age right but when I was younger going viral meant you hit like the

14:15.280 --> 14:19.760
front page new grounds maybe maybe it meant you actually did something really interesting like

14:20.320 --> 14:26.000
like the epic mealtime guys when they went viral back in like 2006 or 2007 whatever it was

14:26.000 --> 14:30.800
they actually were making really cool interesting videos I mean they were ridiculous they were

14:30.800 --> 14:36.000
eating like a hundred thousand calories of food but still it was it was actually a thing that was

14:36.000 --> 14:41.440
happening it took effort it hadn't it took an idea and then them executing the idea even as

14:41.440 --> 14:47.120
viral videos moved on from ridiculous feats and into things like stupid dances

14:47.120 --> 14:53.120
or even just thirst traps like like the whole um the okay boomer girl nico lol right or the gorilla

14:53.120 --> 14:57.360
glue girl who like just did dumb shit with her hair like I think that was kind of the moment

14:57.360 --> 15:04.560
where it started to hit when we saw viral videos and tik tok trends and internet challenges

15:05.120 --> 15:11.120
go from do this ridiculous thing that you're amazing if you pull off to

15:11.760 --> 15:17.440
do this absolutely brain dead fucking loser thing it just makes everyone hate you and think that

15:17.440 --> 15:21.840
you're a retard because after that we got shit like the tide pods and people licking ice cream

15:21.840 --> 15:27.680
and putting it back into onto the shelves it just seems to me like the internet and going viral and

15:27.680 --> 15:35.440
making content was a lot more interesting when it wasn't just pure fucking retards doing like the

15:35.440 --> 15:42.640
most brain dead dumbest lowest denomination shit to desperately try and go viral back when it was

15:42.640 --> 15:47.120
like produced videos or reviews or even just like let's plays and streams that's better than the

15:47.120 --> 15:52.240
garbage we're seeing nowadays jesus tik tok and its consequences have been a disaster for the

15:52.240 --> 15:56.560
human race i kind of wish that covid had fucking taken me finally
