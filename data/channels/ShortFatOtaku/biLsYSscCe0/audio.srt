1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Holy fuck guys, can you hear that?

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:17,220
I don't know if you can see just how much rain there is, look at that.

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,220
Can you hear me?

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,780
The floor is rumbling.

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,760
I'm hanging out the second floor window of the SFO mansion.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,300
Garden looks good at least.

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:44,120
All that bramble back there is cucumbers, but uh, that's tomatoes, kale, but...

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:51,320
This is uh, I'm recording this on the day of Vampire the Masquerade episode 4 on Arch's

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,780
channel.

10
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,900
While he was reading super chats, power went out, there was a fire down the street from

11
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:04,380
a lightning strike.

12
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,900
The neighbor's tree came down on the other side of the house, didn't break anything just

13
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,220
rolled off.

14
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:21,260
But uh, yeah man, this is easily the craziest storm we've had all year.

15
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,840
I'm focusing on the black compost bin in the back there because you can kind of see the

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,520
rain in front of it, at least from here.

17
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:37,040
Oh, see that flash?

18
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,360
There's the back neighbor's yard.

19
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,000
It's a small yard but a big house.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:53,840
Jesus!

21
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:03,200
Holy fuck!

22
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah I guess for those of you who are curious, who may remember this old bit of ancient SFO

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,520
lore, this is the window that we threw the pumpkin out of during like a game play through

24
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,760
like five years ago of, what was it, was it Costume Quest?

25
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,720
It's like a Halloween game.

26
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,720
We threw the pumpkin out of this window.

27
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,040
Jeez.

28
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,200
Fucking hell man.

29
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,840
I guess I'm just gonna wait.

30
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:46,200
Wait it out.

31
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,960
I wanted to stream on Game Boomers tonight.

32
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,960
Oh shit, see that flash?

33
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,920
I wanted to stream on Game Boomers tonight.

34
00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:07,960
I don't know if I'll have the time, or not the time, the power, power's out.

35
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
I don't know though.

36
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,200
There's something oddly comforting about it, eh?

37
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,840
Like listening to the rain or listening to the wind, listening to thunder.

38
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,280
Whenever it rains like this overnight and it's just pitch black out, I'll actually sleep

39
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,280
with my windows open.

40
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,960
I don't mind if water gets in, I just like listening to it.

41
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:44,720
It's a nice sound.

42
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,760
Yeah my power went out first, then the tree came down, and then it came back on.

43
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,960
I was able to get back into the call for Vampire for like a minute or two, and then Sargon

44
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,240
immediately asks, oh shit what happened to you dude?

45
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,200
And then like the power instantly goes out again.

46
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,200
So here I am.

47
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:33,160
There's a flash.

48
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:59,440
Easy man.

49
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,360
Let's pick him back up again.

50
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,640
I can tell by the direction of the drops and how I'm not getting hit even though I'm hanging

51
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:17,920
out the window that the wind seems to be blowing like directly east, going west to east.

52
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,240
Since this window here is on the east side of the house.

53
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,440
Oh getting wet, getting wet a little bit, I guess the wind's changing.

54
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:41,080
There's a siren in the back, I don't know if you can hear that.

55
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,320
I can smell burning too.

56
00:05:45,320 --> 00:06:06,280
I'm going to assume it's from the tree that caught fire down the road.

57
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,800
Normally I post videos like this on the dev kit, my side channel for non-politics stuff,

58
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:22,720
and I'll throw it up on SFO, why not, oh there's a blink.

59
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:36,320
I haven't posted, oh, damn dude.

60
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,840
I haven't posted to SFO in a while, I really should.

61
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:46,760
I have a bunch of videos, but I had to redo some serious electrical in my place here.

62
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,960
Thankfully I did it before the storm, but I had to redo that, that took precedence.

63
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,880
I was on a trip for a while, I was sick for a while.

64
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:02,600
Basically the past two weeks have not been an easy time for getting work done.

65
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:09,440
But frankly I also have to get some, I have to get my office computer formatted.

66
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,840
It's been like two years and change, it's definitely time, assuming it survives the

67
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,280
power outage.

68
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:23,160
Well I don't know if you can tell, maybe I can shine it up that way, I don't know if

69
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:32,520
you can tell this, but there's a bit of blue sky coming in, just very slightly, might be

70
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:44,280
reaching the end of the storm.

71
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,160
Rain's slowing down again.

72
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,720
Lots of thunder, but I think we're getting close to the end of this thing.

73
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,720
I remember seeing on the weather network this was going to be like a flash in the pan kind

74
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,720
of storm, like three hours and it's all done.

75
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,440
Pretty loud and then it's gone.

76
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:21,680
In fact maybe I'll send this in to the weather network, I know that they take submissions.

77
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,840
I kind of feel sorry I didn't come out here sooner, but you know, playing vampire.

78
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:35,220
I probably wouldn't have come out here if the power hadn't gone out.

79
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:48,400
With every one of those deep rumbles the floor shakes, like the house is slightly shaking.

80
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,440
My phone just said I connected to the wifi so I assume the power's back.

81
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,280
I'm going to go check that out.

82
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:03,060
You'll probably see a stream from me tonight at twitch.tv slash game boomers assuming that

83
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,240
I have no problems with the power.

84
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:15,120
If I do you'll see it in an hour and change, maybe two hours.

85
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,960
And if I don't have power, well I have a camera with a battery pack that still has

86
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:25,400
quite a bit of juice in it so I'm going to shoot something else.

87
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,460
I've actually been recording some hardware, oh gee that's deep, I've actually been recording

88
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,040
some hardware unboxings that I'm going to put up on the dev kit so maybe you guys can

89
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
enjoy those soon.

90
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,520
And yeah you'll see a new SFO video from me soon.

91
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:48,240
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I was basically out of the game for like two weeks.

92
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,560
There's a lot of sirens in the city, I don't think you can hear them, they're probably

93
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,200
too far away for the camera, but there's a lot of sirens in the city.

94
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:04,960
Can you hear that one?

95
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,120
I've got to assume with downed lines, you know downed trees, there's a downed tree around

96
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:28,120
the corner, fires that are starting from the lightning, there's a fire in another corner.

97
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,080
You can still hear like all the drops dripping but the rain's actually mostly done, this

98
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:39,200
is, oh Jesus, I can't, I didn't have it pointed, it was right there, a giant bolt right there

99
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:55,400
behind that tree.

100
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,160
I caught the sound though, wow.

101
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:08,240
I'm sorry I didn't have it pointed out that way man, but I saw it, it nearly blinded me,

102
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,680
so I was looking almost directly at it.

103
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:23,960
There we go.

104
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,480
That's a lot of seconds.

105
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:34,200
Where's the thunder for that second one?

106
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,480
There it is.

107
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
That's pretty far away.

108
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:52,800
What was that, ten seconds, so that's ten miles, is that how it goes, one mile a second?

109
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,280
Crazy.

110
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:10,040
Anyway, yeah, if the weather cooperates, you'll see me on Twitch tonight, and you know what,

111
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,920
the rain's pretty much stopped, all the drips you're hearing is water coming off the trees

112
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:22,760
and off the roofs, just from wind, like look at this big tree, the wind's pretty strong,

113
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,720
it's moving it around a fair bit, but I think the rain's pretty much done.

114
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:37,360
I don't know if you can see this, look at the deck, the water's not really rippling

115
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,000
on it as if raindrops are hitting it, so I think the storm's done, it's just thundering

116
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,080
off in the distance now.

117
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:58,960
Yeah, the sun's coming out a little bit too, I don't know if you can tell though, but okay,

118
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,400
that's it.

119
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:11,000
Wish me luck guys, hope you'll see, oh, oh Christ, I keep wanting to end the video, and

120
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:19,640
that always happens.

121
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah, I keep wanting to end the video, and then I get something like that, so I just

122
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,080
keep staying on.

123
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,760
There's a lot of alarms in the distance.

124
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:53,400
Okay, let's see if Mother Nature will cooperate, if, I guess not, because there it was, this

125
00:13:53,400 --> 00:14:04,680
is just how it's going to be, isn't it?

126
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:17,160
Okay.

127
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:23,520
If the weather cooperates, and I think it will, I'll be up on Twitch in an hour or two.

128
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,080
Twitch.tv slash Game Boomers.

129
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,920
If not, I'll find something productive to do with my time.

130
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:35,600
Man, listen to that siren.

131
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,640
The cars on the road over there, they're getting backed up, I wonder if this is going to be

132
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
an accident.

133
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,640
Yeah man, I'll just tack this on at the end.

134
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,400
Rain's stopped, thunder's still going off, but this is the other side of the house, and

135
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,920
you can see the sunny sky.

136
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
It's kind of crazy.

137
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:57,360
Look at all that water, just flowing down the street.

138
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,160
That's nuts, man.

139
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,800
I didn't mean that to be a squirrel pun, but I guess it is.

140
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,880
Anyway, yeah, I think I'll be fine.

141
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:16,680
Swing by in about an hour and a half, maybe two hours, Twitch.tv slash Game Boomers.

142
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,760
I don't know what I'm playing tonight, but I'm playing some kind of video game, and I'll

143
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,200
chat with you guys and hang out.

144
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Alright, I'll see you there.

145
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,800
I love you.
