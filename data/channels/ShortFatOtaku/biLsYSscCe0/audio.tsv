0	5500	Holy fuck guys, can you hear that?
5500	17220	I don't know if you can see just how much rain there is, look at that.
17220	18220	Can you hear me?
18220	21780	The floor is rumbling.
21780	26760	I'm hanging out the second floor window of the SFO mansion.
26760	29300	Garden looks good at least.
29300	44120	All that bramble back there is cucumbers, but uh, that's tomatoes, kale, but...
44120	51320	This is uh, I'm recording this on the day of Vampire the Masquerade episode 4 on Arch's
51320	52780	channel.
52780	58900	While he was reading super chats, power went out, there was a fire down the street from
58900	64380	a lightning strike.
64380	68900	The neighbor's tree came down on the other side of the house, didn't break anything just
68900	73220	rolled off.
73220	81260	But uh, yeah man, this is easily the craziest storm we've had all year.
81260	85840	I'm focusing on the black compost bin in the back there because you can kind of see the
85840	90520	rain in front of it, at least from here.
90520	97040	Oh, see that flash?
97040	100360	There's the back neighbor's yard.
100360	103000	It's a small yard but a big house.
103000	113840	Jesus!
113840	123200	Holy fuck!
123200	128000	Yeah I guess for those of you who are curious, who may remember this old bit of ancient SFO
128000	134520	lore, this is the window that we threw the pumpkin out of during like a game play through
134520	137760	like five years ago of, what was it, was it Costume Quest?
137760	140720	It's like a Halloween game.
140720	145720	We threw the pumpkin out of this window.
145720	147040	Jeez.
147040	151200	Fucking hell man.
151200	156840	I guess I'm just gonna wait.
156840	166200	Wait it out.
166200	167960	I wanted to stream on Game Boomers tonight.
167960	169960	Oh shit, see that flash?
169960	172920	I wanted to stream on Game Boomers tonight.
172920	187960	I don't know if I'll have the time, or not the time, the power, power's out.
187960	188960	I don't know though.
188960	191200	There's something oddly comforting about it, eh?
191200	197840	Like listening to the rain or listening to the wind, listening to thunder.
197840	202280	Whenever it rains like this overnight and it's just pitch black out, I'll actually sleep
202280	203280	with my windows open.
203280	205960	I don't mind if water gets in, I just like listening to it.
205960	224720	It's a nice sound.
224720	230760	Yeah my power went out first, then the tree came down, and then it came back on.
230760	235960	I was able to get back into the call for Vampire for like a minute or two, and then Sargon
235960	239240	immediately asks, oh shit what happened to you dude?
239240	242200	And then like the power instantly goes out again.
242200	246200	So here I am.
246200	273160	There's a flash.
273160	299440	Easy man.
299440	304360	Let's pick him back up again.
304360	308640	I can tell by the direction of the drops and how I'm not getting hit even though I'm hanging
308640	317920	out the window that the wind seems to be blowing like directly east, going west to east.
317920	321240	Since this window here is on the east side of the house.
321240	327440	Oh getting wet, getting wet a little bit, I guess the wind's changing.
327440	341080	There's a siren in the back, I don't know if you can hear that.
341080	345320	I can smell burning too.
345320	366280	I'm going to assume it's from the tree that caught fire down the road.
366280	372800	Normally I post videos like this on the dev kit, my side channel for non-politics stuff,
372800	382720	and I'll throw it up on SFO, why not, oh there's a blink.
382720	396320	I haven't posted, oh, damn dude.
396320	398840	I haven't posted to SFO in a while, I really should.
398840	406760	I have a bunch of videos, but I had to redo some serious electrical in my place here.
406760	411960	Thankfully I did it before the storm, but I had to redo that, that took precedence.
411960	414880	I was on a trip for a while, I was sick for a while.
414880	422600	Basically the past two weeks have not been an easy time for getting work done.
422600	429440	But frankly I also have to get some, I have to get my office computer formatted.
429440	433840	It's been like two years and change, it's definitely time, assuming it survives the
433840	435280	power outage.
435280	443160	Well I don't know if you can tell, maybe I can shine it up that way, I don't know if
443160	452520	you can tell this, but there's a bit of blue sky coming in, just very slightly, might be
452520	464280	reaching the end of the storm.
464280	467160	Rain's slowing down again.
467160	469720	Lots of thunder, but I think we're getting close to the end of this thing.
469720	473720	I remember seeing on the weather network this was going to be like a flash in the pan kind
473720	476720	of storm, like three hours and it's all done.
476720	479440	Pretty loud and then it's gone.
479440	501680	In fact maybe I'll send this in to the weather network, I know that they take submissions.
501680	506840	I kind of feel sorry I didn't come out here sooner, but you know, playing vampire.
506840	515220	I probably wouldn't have come out here if the power hadn't gone out.
515220	528400	With every one of those deep rumbles the floor shakes, like the house is slightly shaking.
528400	532440	My phone just said I connected to the wifi so I assume the power's back.
532440	537280	I'm going to go check that out.
537280	543060	You'll probably see a stream from me tonight at twitch.tv slash game boomers assuming that
543060	546240	I have no problems with the power.
546240	555120	If I do you'll see it in an hour and change, maybe two hours.
555120	558960	And if I don't have power, well I have a camera with a battery pack that still has
558960	565400	quite a bit of juice in it so I'm going to shoot something else.
565400	570460	I've actually been recording some hardware, oh gee that's deep, I've actually been recording
570460	574040	some hardware unboxings that I'm going to put up on the dev kit so maybe you guys can
574040	575040	enjoy those soon.
575040	578520	And yeah you'll see a new SFO video from me soon.
578520	588240	I'm sorry, I'm sorry I was basically out of the game for like two weeks.
588240	590560	There's a lot of sirens in the city, I don't think you can hear them, they're probably
590560	596200	too far away for the camera, but there's a lot of sirens in the city.
596200	604960	Can you hear that one?
604960	610120	I've got to assume with downed lines, you know downed trees, there's a downed tree around
610120	628120	the corner, fires that are starting from the lightning, there's a fire in another corner.
628120	632080	You can still hear like all the drops dripping but the rain's actually mostly done, this
632080	639200	is, oh Jesus, I can't, I didn't have it pointed, it was right there, a giant bolt right there
639200	655400	behind that tree.
655400	660160	I caught the sound though, wow.
660160	668240	I'm sorry I didn't have it pointed out that way man, but I saw it, it nearly blinded me,
668240	674680	so I was looking almost directly at it.
674680	683960	There we go.
683960	686480	That's a lot of seconds.
686480	694200	Where's the thunder for that second one?
694200	696480	There it is.
696480	697480	That's pretty far away.
697480	712800	What was that, ten seconds, so that's ten miles, is that how it goes, one mile a second?
712800	716280	Crazy.
716280	730040	Anyway, yeah, if the weather cooperates, you'll see me on Twitch tonight, and you know what,
730040	734920	the rain's pretty much stopped, all the drips you're hearing is water coming off the trees
734920	742760	and off the roofs, just from wind, like look at this big tree, the wind's pretty strong,
742760	748720	it's moving it around a fair bit, but I think the rain's pretty much done.
748720	757360	I don't know if you can see this, look at the deck, the water's not really rippling
757360	762000	on it as if raindrops are hitting it, so I think the storm's done, it's just thundering
762000	765080	off in the distance now.
765080	778960	Yeah, the sun's coming out a little bit too, I don't know if you can tell though, but okay,
778960	781400	that's it.
781400	791000	Wish me luck guys, hope you'll see, oh, oh Christ, I keep wanting to end the video, and
791000	799640	that always happens.
799640	813000	Yeah, I keep wanting to end the video, and then I get something like that, so I just
813000	817080	keep staying on.
817080	820760	There's a lot of alarms in the distance.
820760	833400	Okay, let's see if Mother Nature will cooperate, if, I guess not, because there it was, this
833400	844680	is just how it's going to be, isn't it?
844680	857160	Okay.
857160	863520	If the weather cooperates, and I think it will, I'll be up on Twitch in an hour or two.
863520	866080	Twitch.tv slash Game Boomers.
866080	868920	If not, I'll find something productive to do with my time.
868920	875600	Man, listen to that siren.
875600	878640	The cars on the road over there, they're getting backed up, I wonder if this is going to be
878640	879640	an accident.
879640	882640	Yeah man, I'll just tack this on at the end.
882640	887400	Rain's stopped, thunder's still going off, but this is the other side of the house, and
887400	888920	you can see the sunny sky.
888920	890920	It's kind of crazy.
890920	897360	Look at all that water, just flowing down the street.
897360	902160	That's nuts, man.
902160	905800	I didn't mean that to be a squirrel pun, but I guess it is.
905800	909880	Anyway, yeah, I think I'll be fine.
909880	916680	Swing by in about an hour and a half, maybe two hours, Twitch.tv slash Game Boomers.
916680	919760	I don't know what I'm playing tonight, but I'm playing some kind of video game, and I'll
919760	921200	chat with you guys and hang out.
921200	922200	Alright, I'll see you there.
922200	922800	I love you.
