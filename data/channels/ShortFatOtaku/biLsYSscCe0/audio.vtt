WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.500
Holy fuck guys, can you hear that?

00:05.500 --> 00:17.220
I don't know if you can see just how much rain there is, look at that.

00:17.220 --> 00:18.220
Can you hear me?

00:18.220 --> 00:21.780
The floor is rumbling.

00:21.780 --> 00:26.760
I'm hanging out the second floor window of the SFO mansion.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.300
Garden looks good at least.

00:29.300 --> 00:44.120
All that bramble back there is cucumbers, but uh, that's tomatoes, kale, but...

00:44.120 --> 00:51.320
This is uh, I'm recording this on the day of Vampire the Masquerade episode 4 on Arch's

00:51.320 --> 00:52.780
channel.

00:52.780 --> 00:58.900
While he was reading super chats, power went out, there was a fire down the street from

00:58.900 --> 01:04.380
a lightning strike.

01:04.380 --> 01:08.900
The neighbor's tree came down on the other side of the house, didn't break anything just

01:08.900 --> 01:13.220
rolled off.

01:13.220 --> 01:21.260
But uh, yeah man, this is easily the craziest storm we've had all year.

01:21.260 --> 01:25.840
I'm focusing on the black compost bin in the back there because you can kind of see the

01:25.840 --> 01:30.520
rain in front of it, at least from here.

01:30.520 --> 01:37.040
Oh, see that flash?

01:37.040 --> 01:40.360
There's the back neighbor's yard.

01:40.360 --> 01:43.000
It's a small yard but a big house.

01:43.000 --> 01:53.840
Jesus!

01:53.840 --> 02:03.200
Holy fuck!

02:03.200 --> 02:08.000
Yeah I guess for those of you who are curious, who may remember this old bit of ancient SFO

02:08.000 --> 02:14.520
lore, this is the window that we threw the pumpkin out of during like a game play through

02:14.520 --> 02:17.760
like five years ago of, what was it, was it Costume Quest?

02:17.760 --> 02:20.720
It's like a Halloween game.

02:20.720 --> 02:25.720
We threw the pumpkin out of this window.

02:25.720 --> 02:27.040
Jeez.

02:27.040 --> 02:31.200
Fucking hell man.

02:31.200 --> 02:36.840
I guess I'm just gonna wait.

02:36.840 --> 02:46.200
Wait it out.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.960
I wanted to stream on Game Boomers tonight.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.960
Oh shit, see that flash?

02:49.960 --> 02:52.920
I wanted to stream on Game Boomers tonight.

02:52.920 --> 03:07.960
I don't know if I'll have the time, or not the time, the power, power's out.

03:07.960 --> 03:08.960
I don't know though.

03:08.960 --> 03:11.200
There's something oddly comforting about it, eh?

03:11.200 --> 03:17.840
Like listening to the rain or listening to the wind, listening to thunder.

03:17.840 --> 03:22.280
Whenever it rains like this overnight and it's just pitch black out, I'll actually sleep

03:22.280 --> 03:23.280
with my windows open.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.960
I don't mind if water gets in, I just like listening to it.

03:25.960 --> 03:44.720
It's a nice sound.

03:44.720 --> 03:50.760
Yeah my power went out first, then the tree came down, and then it came back on.

03:50.760 --> 03:55.960
I was able to get back into the call for Vampire for like a minute or two, and then Sargon

03:55.960 --> 03:59.240
immediately asks, oh shit what happened to you dude?

03:59.240 --> 04:02.200
And then like the power instantly goes out again.

04:02.200 --> 04:06.200
So here I am.

04:06.200 --> 04:33.160
There's a flash.

04:33.160 --> 04:59.440
Easy man.

04:59.440 --> 05:04.360
Let's pick him back up again.

05:04.360 --> 05:08.640
I can tell by the direction of the drops and how I'm not getting hit even though I'm hanging

05:08.640 --> 05:17.920
out the window that the wind seems to be blowing like directly east, going west to east.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.240
Since this window here is on the east side of the house.

05:21.240 --> 05:27.440
Oh getting wet, getting wet a little bit, I guess the wind's changing.

05:27.440 --> 05:41.080
There's a siren in the back, I don't know if you can hear that.

05:41.080 --> 05:45.320
I can smell burning too.

05:45.320 --> 06:06.280
I'm going to assume it's from the tree that caught fire down the road.

06:06.280 --> 06:12.800
Normally I post videos like this on the dev kit, my side channel for non-politics stuff,

06:12.800 --> 06:22.720
and I'll throw it up on SFO, why not, oh there's a blink.

06:22.720 --> 06:36.320
I haven't posted, oh, damn dude.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.840
I haven't posted to SFO in a while, I really should.

06:38.840 --> 06:46.760
I have a bunch of videos, but I had to redo some serious electrical in my place here.

06:46.760 --> 06:51.960
Thankfully I did it before the storm, but I had to redo that, that took precedence.

06:51.960 --> 06:54.880
I was on a trip for a while, I was sick for a while.

06:54.880 --> 07:02.600
Basically the past two weeks have not been an easy time for getting work done.

07:02.600 --> 07:09.440
But frankly I also have to get some, I have to get my office computer formatted.

07:09.440 --> 07:13.840
It's been like two years and change, it's definitely time, assuming it survives the

07:13.840 --> 07:15.280
power outage.

07:15.280 --> 07:23.160
Well I don't know if you can tell, maybe I can shine it up that way, I don't know if

07:23.160 --> 07:32.520
you can tell this, but there's a bit of blue sky coming in, just very slightly, might be

07:32.520 --> 07:44.280
reaching the end of the storm.

07:44.280 --> 07:47.160
Rain's slowing down again.

07:47.160 --> 07:49.720
Lots of thunder, but I think we're getting close to the end of this thing.

07:49.720 --> 07:53.720
I remember seeing on the weather network this was going to be like a flash in the pan kind

07:53.720 --> 07:56.720
of storm, like three hours and it's all done.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.440
Pretty loud and then it's gone.

07:59.440 --> 08:21.680
In fact maybe I'll send this in to the weather network, I know that they take submissions.

08:21.680 --> 08:26.840
I kind of feel sorry I didn't come out here sooner, but you know, playing vampire.

08:26.840 --> 08:35.220
I probably wouldn't have come out here if the power hadn't gone out.

08:35.220 --> 08:48.400
With every one of those deep rumbles the floor shakes, like the house is slightly shaking.

08:48.400 --> 08:52.440
My phone just said I connected to the wifi so I assume the power's back.

08:52.440 --> 08:57.280
I'm going to go check that out.

08:57.280 --> 09:03.060
You'll probably see a stream from me tonight at twitch.tv slash game boomers assuming that

09:03.060 --> 09:06.240
I have no problems with the power.

09:06.240 --> 09:15.120
If I do you'll see it in an hour and change, maybe two hours.

09:15.120 --> 09:18.960
And if I don't have power, well I have a camera with a battery pack that still has

09:18.960 --> 09:25.400
quite a bit of juice in it so I'm going to shoot something else.

09:25.400 --> 09:30.460
I've actually been recording some hardware, oh gee that's deep, I've actually been recording

09:30.460 --> 09:34.040
some hardware unboxings that I'm going to put up on the dev kit so maybe you guys can

09:34.040 --> 09:35.040
enjoy those soon.

09:35.040 --> 09:38.520
And yeah you'll see a new SFO video from me soon.

09:38.520 --> 09:48.240
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I was basically out of the game for like two weeks.

09:48.240 --> 09:50.560
There's a lot of sirens in the city, I don't think you can hear them, they're probably

09:50.560 --> 09:56.200
too far away for the camera, but there's a lot of sirens in the city.

09:56.200 --> 10:04.960
Can you hear that one?

10:04.960 --> 10:10.120
I've got to assume with downed lines, you know downed trees, there's a downed tree around

10:10.120 --> 10:28.120
the corner, fires that are starting from the lightning, there's a fire in another corner.

10:28.120 --> 10:32.080
You can still hear like all the drops dripping but the rain's actually mostly done, this

10:32.080 --> 10:39.200
is, oh Jesus, I can't, I didn't have it pointed, it was right there, a giant bolt right there

10:39.200 --> 10:55.400
behind that tree.

10:55.400 --> 11:00.160
I caught the sound though, wow.

11:00.160 --> 11:08.240
I'm sorry I didn't have it pointed out that way man, but I saw it, it nearly blinded me,

11:08.240 --> 11:14.680
so I was looking almost directly at it.

11:14.680 --> 11:23.960
There we go.

11:23.960 --> 11:26.480
That's a lot of seconds.

11:26.480 --> 11:34.200
Where's the thunder for that second one?

11:34.200 --> 11:36.480
There it is.

11:36.480 --> 11:37.480
That's pretty far away.

11:37.480 --> 11:52.800
What was that, ten seconds, so that's ten miles, is that how it goes, one mile a second?

11:52.800 --> 11:56.280
Crazy.

11:56.280 --> 12:10.040
Anyway, yeah, if the weather cooperates, you'll see me on Twitch tonight, and you know what,

12:10.040 --> 12:14.920
the rain's pretty much stopped, all the drips you're hearing is water coming off the trees

12:14.920 --> 12:22.760
and off the roofs, just from wind, like look at this big tree, the wind's pretty strong,

12:22.760 --> 12:28.720
it's moving it around a fair bit, but I think the rain's pretty much done.

12:28.720 --> 12:37.360
I don't know if you can see this, look at the deck, the water's not really rippling

12:37.360 --> 12:42.000
on it as if raindrops are hitting it, so I think the storm's done, it's just thundering

12:42.000 --> 12:45.080
off in the distance now.

12:45.080 --> 12:58.960
Yeah, the sun's coming out a little bit too, I don't know if you can tell though, but okay,

12:58.960 --> 13:01.400
that's it.

13:01.400 --> 13:11.000
Wish me luck guys, hope you'll see, oh, oh Christ, I keep wanting to end the video, and

13:11.000 --> 13:19.640
that always happens.

13:19.640 --> 13:33.000
Yeah, I keep wanting to end the video, and then I get something like that, so I just

13:33.000 --> 13:37.080
keep staying on.

13:37.080 --> 13:40.760
There's a lot of alarms in the distance.

13:40.760 --> 13:53.400
Okay, let's see if Mother Nature will cooperate, if, I guess not, because there it was, this

13:53.400 --> 14:04.680
is just how it's going to be, isn't it?

14:04.680 --> 14:17.160
Okay.

14:17.160 --> 14:23.520
If the weather cooperates, and I think it will, I'll be up on Twitch in an hour or two.

14:23.520 --> 14:26.080
Twitch.tv slash Game Boomers.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.920
If not, I'll find something productive to do with my time.

14:28.920 --> 14:35.600
Man, listen to that siren.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.640
The cars on the road over there, they're getting backed up, I wonder if this is going to be

14:38.640 --> 14:39.640
an accident.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.640
Yeah man, I'll just tack this on at the end.

14:42.640 --> 14:47.400
Rain's stopped, thunder's still going off, but this is the other side of the house, and

14:47.400 --> 14:48.920
you can see the sunny sky.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.920
It's kind of crazy.

14:50.920 --> 14:57.360
Look at all that water, just flowing down the street.

14:57.360 --> 15:02.160
That's nuts, man.

15:02.160 --> 15:05.800
I didn't mean that to be a squirrel pun, but I guess it is.

15:05.800 --> 15:09.880
Anyway, yeah, I think I'll be fine.

15:09.880 --> 15:16.680
Swing by in about an hour and a half, maybe two hours, Twitch.tv slash Game Boomers.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.760
I don't know what I'm playing tonight, but I'm playing some kind of video game, and I'll

15:19.760 --> 15:21.200
chat with you guys and hang out.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.200
Alright, I'll see you there.

15:22.200 --> 15:22.800
I love you.
