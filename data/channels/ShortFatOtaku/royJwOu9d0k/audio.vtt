00:00.000 --> 00:16.920
Google Stadia is dead, and thank god for that. For those of you who don't know, Google Stadia

00:16.920 --> 00:20.480
was Google's attempt to enter into the cloud gaming market. Uh-huh, for those of you who

00:20.480 --> 00:24.200
don't know what that is, cloud gaming is where the video game you're playing is physically

00:24.200 --> 00:29.000
hosted somewhere very far away. Here's the most simplistic, boomer-friendly explanation.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.240
You know how, back in the 1980s, if you were gonna play a video game, maybe you had a Nintendo,

00:33.240 --> 00:36.720
maybe you had an old computer, the game would appear on the TV or the monitor, but the game

00:36.720 --> 00:40.520
itself would be running on the hardware of the PC or the NES. The latency between the

00:40.520 --> 00:44.900
device generating the game and the image output on the screen is virtually zero because they're

00:44.900 --> 00:49.560
right beside each other. As technology advanced, people tried and failed to invent working

00:49.560 --> 00:53.680
wireless controllers so you could play video games from further away. Infrared controllers

00:53.680 --> 00:58.280
needed a direct line of sight and could be blocked by a passing dust mote, while primitive

00:58.280 --> 01:02.600
pre-Bluetooth tech of the 90s added way too much latency. You'd press a button on the

01:02.600 --> 01:06.520
controller and the action in the game might happen a full second later. It was only with

01:06.520 --> 01:10.580
the invention of the Wavebird controller for the Nintendo GameCube that wireless controller

01:10.580 --> 01:15.600
technology matured enough to actually be on par with a wired experience. What cloud gaming

01:15.600 --> 01:19.360
is, is when the device running your game, the console or the computer, isn't in your

01:19.360 --> 01:24.200
living room but is instead potentially thousands of miles away at one of Google's data centers.

01:24.200 --> 01:28.080
The upside of this idea is that you don't have to buy your own console or PC anymore.

01:28.080 --> 01:31.520
You can simply connect to the Google Stadia service, pay a monthly subscription fee and

01:31.520 --> 01:35.300
have the games streamed over the internet to your TV screen. Stadia was technically

01:35.300 --> 01:39.900
available on any device that could run a Google Chrome browser. PCs, phones, tablets, TVs,

01:39.900 --> 01:43.640
and if for some reason your TV couldn't run it, you could buy a little Google Stadia

01:43.640 --> 01:48.720
broadcaster dongly thing that clips onto the TV. The cost of actually building or owning

01:48.720 --> 01:52.300
the expensive hardware that runs the game is collectivized. Rather than having your

01:52.300 --> 01:56.760
brand new PS5 sit there idle when you're not using it, if all the raw hardware is stored

01:56.760 --> 02:00.600
at Google's data centers, it can simply be repurposed for somebody else's game.

02:00.600 --> 02:05.300
However, intuitively, it's not hard to understand how this is a bad idea in terms of the actual

02:05.300 --> 02:09.620
experience of playing the game. If you think that latency was bad with primitive wireless

02:09.620 --> 02:13.400
controllers when you were sitting just a bit too far away from the screen, imagine latency

02:13.400 --> 02:16.620
when your game is being played on the other side of the country and transmitted over the

02:16.620 --> 02:20.580
internet. According to Google though, there was no latency. In fact, it was better than

02:20.580 --> 02:24.840
playing the game in your own home due to what they called negative latency. What this actually

02:24.840 --> 02:29.480
is, was a buffer of predicted latency inherent to a Stadia player's setup or connection in

02:29.480 --> 02:34.500
which the Stadia system will run lag mitigation. This can include increasing FPS rapidly to

02:34.500 --> 02:39.840
reduce latency between player input and display or even predicting user inputs. Yes, Google

02:39.840 --> 02:43.660
Stadia included AI learning that would come to predict your button presses and execute

02:43.660 --> 02:47.180
them before you did in game, back on their home server, making it feel like you were

02:47.180 --> 02:50.480
the one pressing the button at home, but it was them. They were literally going to have

02:50.480 --> 02:55.100
the game play itself to overcome the natural limitations of their own business model.

02:55.100 --> 02:59.100
Stadia launched in late 2019, and it was pretty obvious to everyone that it was going to be

02:59.100 --> 03:02.280
a bomb before you even got out there. That didn't stop them from trying, and initial

03:02.280 --> 03:06.700
reviews all voiced the same complaints that we had all predicted. Latency with the games

03:06.700 --> 03:11.300
was horrible, with the new Mortal Kombat game in particular being virtually unplayable,

03:11.300 --> 03:15.500
featuring several seconds of delay between input and action, making combos and fatalities

03:15.500 --> 03:19.860
impossible to pull off. Google blamed this not on their hardware or on the internet,

03:19.860 --> 03:23.000
but on the developers who made the games, saying they just didn't know how to do it

03:23.000 --> 03:27.280
right on their revolutionary new product. After all, their hardware was more powerful

03:27.280 --> 03:31.580
than the PS4 Pro or the Xbox One X. They've got the 4K gaming experience, as long as you

03:31.580 --> 03:35.280
bought the Premium subscription. It's everyone else's fault it wasn't working. Developers

03:35.280 --> 03:39.240
of course had their own take. Google, frankly, didn't pay them enough to get their games

03:39.240 --> 03:43.520
working on Stadia. Game selection at launch was also not great. The Stadia started its

03:43.520 --> 03:48.320
life with 22 games available, which isn't bad, but they were almost entirely ports of

03:48.320 --> 03:52.900
games that were several years old. No exclusives and very few new titles. And a lot of shit

03:52.900 --> 03:58.300
just didn't work. Family sharing didn't work. Achievements didn't work. Stadia on iOS didn't

03:58.300 --> 04:02.060
work. And on some versions of Chromecast, another Google product, in fact the prime

04:02.060 --> 04:06.500
Google product for this service, Stadia didn't work. For some people, Stadia itself didn't

04:06.500 --> 04:10.440
work, as Google failed to provide invite codes with their Stadia subscriptions. And worst

04:10.440 --> 04:14.300
of all, in my opinion, was the announcement that Google Stadia games would still cost

04:14.300 --> 04:18.240
full price, alongside buying the controller and paying the subscription fee to access

04:18.240 --> 04:22.320
the service. Stadia was compared to Netflix because Netflix's model is similar. You don't

04:22.320 --> 04:25.580
own the movie or the show, it's stored on the Netflix servers and transmitted to you

04:25.580 --> 04:28.920
over the internet, just like the games you play on Stadia. But this is like, in addition

04:28.920 --> 04:32.620
to buying the TV and paying for the internet service and paying for your Netflix subscription,

04:32.620 --> 04:37.040
you had to pay for every movie or show on Netflix you watched. You own them, and that

04:37.040 --> 04:40.060
they're in your library on Netflix, but it's not like you own the physical copy. That's

04:40.060 --> 04:44.120
what Stadia was doing. As the service began to mature, people began to take notice of

04:44.120 --> 04:47.600
the slow trickle of new games coming out, as well as the lack of improvements to actually

04:47.600 --> 04:51.920
make the service, you know, work. The latency problem never really got solved, and the games

04:51.920 --> 04:55.820
were shadows of what they were on other platforms. The system's best exclusive game was Super

04:55.820 --> 05:01.000
Bomberman R Online, and that moved off Stadia in early 2021, just to try and stay alive.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.840
Funnily enough, an editor at Game Informer was told by a Stadia rep that Super Bomberman

05:04.840 --> 05:08.360
R Online could never come out on another platform because of the fundamental way the game was

05:08.360 --> 05:12.040
programmed. There was also weird oddities that just made people think that Google had

05:12.040 --> 05:15.720
no idea what they were doing. Like how the Stadia profile page included areas to input

05:15.720 --> 05:21.300
your ICQ number, AIM scream name, MSN messenger, and Yahoo ID. All services that went the way

05:21.300 --> 05:25.700
of the dodo a decade ago. I remember using this shit in high school. Google hand-waved

05:25.700 --> 05:32.400
everything by going back to that dry old well of video games controversy. Yes, thank you,

05:32.400 --> 05:36.100
Frost, don't worry, your time will come on this channel. Google vows to fight abuse that

05:36.100 --> 05:39.980
could pop up in Stadia communities. Google wants to prevent its new Stadia from being

05:39.980 --> 05:44.220
filled up with racists, bigots, and trolls who congregate online. Like, listen to how

05:44.220 --> 05:48.700
this is framed. Creating the community could also open the door to abusive conduct and

05:48.700 --> 05:52.900
content, a problem that already plagues Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social media platforms.

05:52.900 --> 05:56.980
Tech platforms are under intense scrutiny for failing to police what happens on their

05:56.980 --> 06:00.580
services. Google wants to make sure the problems don't reappear on Stadia. They view the internet

06:00.580 --> 06:04.860
itself as inherently a racist place. They view their own audience as a problem that

06:04.860 --> 06:09.900
needs to be solved. The actual issue is that people are inherently rowdy and edgy and judgey

06:09.900 --> 06:13.220
and shitposty, and that's not going to go away with a bit of social engineering from

06:13.220 --> 06:17.700
Google. People simply won't use your service. And of course, the old boogeyman is brought

06:17.700 --> 06:22.100
up. Discord, a chat app for gamers, has been criticized for being what some say is a safe

06:22.100 --> 06:26.780
place for white supremacists and anti-Semites. Gamergate, an online movement that gained

06:26.780 --> 06:33.540
steam in 2014, pushed some of the sexist and racist tropes of prevalent in gaming culture.

06:33.540 --> 06:37.860
Jesus, CNET, do you proofread your shit before publishing it? It's no surprise that this

06:37.860 --> 06:41.540
is the direction Google went with Stadia, as it's the direction they go company-wide.

06:41.540 --> 06:45.700
Woke nonsense force-fed to all employees through diversity training seminars and other garbage

06:45.700 --> 06:50.260
like that. A lot of the more moronic Stadia-related decisions can be understood through this lens.

06:50.260 --> 06:54.880
Like for example, Google's press packages including an emphasis on what they call gender-neutral

06:54.880 --> 06:59.900
controllers to appeal to women. What exactly made the Google Stadia controller gender-neutral?

06:59.900 --> 07:04.460
Well they made it in green. That's literally it. I don't know about you, but different

07:04.460 --> 07:08.660
colored controllers, including green, have been Nintendo's thing since the 90s. I don't

07:08.660 --> 07:12.220
think it's progressive or revolutionary. Maybe you have to slap that label on if it

07:12.220 --> 07:16.260
really counts. All of the complaints and issues were covered up on the subreddit r slash Stadia

07:16.260 --> 07:20.740
because all the moderators of that sub were Google employees. Seriously, Google runs the

07:20.740 --> 07:25.220
fan communities of the Stadia and spent the lifespan of the Stadia purging all the bad

07:25.220 --> 07:29.760
press and negative customer responses. Despite this though, fan complaints still kept getting

07:29.760 --> 07:33.380
through and going viral because there were just so many of them. Like pause the video

07:33.380 --> 07:36.860
and read some of these for yourself. Look at this one. They just hit the online player

07:36.860 --> 07:42.500
limit of 16 people in a single game of grid for the first time. Usually, nobody is playing

07:42.500 --> 07:47.380
anything on the Stadia. This was back in January of 2020, two months after launch. The service

07:47.380 --> 07:51.680
was dead before it even got off the ground. That didn't stop them from simultaneously

07:51.680 --> 07:56.700
announcing expansion plans in March and a free pass in April. Guys, stop throwing money

07:56.700 --> 08:01.380
into this black hole. It was no surprise to anyone that Google announced the final shutdown

08:01.380 --> 08:05.560
of Stadia a few weeks ago. The only surprise is that the service managed to limp along

08:05.560 --> 08:10.700
as far as it did. It will finally close its doors in early 2023, just past the three year

08:10.700 --> 08:14.560
mark. It was really funny as the last few Stadia users began to notice that Google had

08:14.560 --> 08:17.820
stopped talking about the Stadia, stopped updating it, was no longer moderating the

08:17.820 --> 08:21.420
subreddit, was no longer replying to anyone, and they had purchased all of these games

08:21.420 --> 08:24.300
that might be disappearing soon. What was going to happen to their money and their saves

08:24.300 --> 08:28.660
and their games? I've always been a proponent of owning physical copies of games where possible

08:28.660 --> 08:32.580
to avoid bullshit like this, but Google actually surprised everyone, saying that they would

08:32.580 --> 08:36.600
all get a refund of their games purchases when the service finally closed down. Some

08:36.600 --> 08:40.860
companies are offering transfer services to move gamers save files off Stadia to a different

08:40.860 --> 08:44.300
platform, but for other people they're just shit out of luck. As Stadia closes its doors,

08:44.300 --> 08:48.140
the subreddit has gotten really weird. Like check this out, rest in peace Google Stadia,

08:48.140 --> 08:51.940
you're awesome. Cloud gaming is sustainable gaming. Why are we using environmentalist

08:51.940 --> 08:55.980
activist language here? The bottom of the post reads, the savings in hardware cost,

08:55.980 --> 09:00.460
distribution, energy use, etc that cloud gaming provides because infrastructure is shared doesn't

09:00.460 --> 09:04.980
need a cool box and stands in an efficient data center should almost make it a requirement for

09:04.980 --> 09:10.340
all next-gen games. Why let people buy an expensive box they hardly play when they can use it in the

09:10.340 --> 09:14.940
cloud? Cloud gaming is sustainable gaming. You hear that pleb? The next part of live in the pod

09:14.940 --> 09:19.260
and eat the bugs is gonna be play on the cloud. You don't need to own your own stuff, just rent

09:19.260 --> 09:23.340
it from the data center. It's more sustainable. Stop being so selfish and wanting, you know,

09:23.380 --> 09:29.460
your own PlayStation. Google spent a lot of time and I mean a lot trying to reassure gamers that

09:29.460 --> 09:33.860
Stadia was here to stay, but it was all bullshit blowing smoke up everyone's ass hoping that their

09:33.860 --> 09:38.260
shitty product would catch on, but it never did. We all predicted Stadia's failure before it even

09:38.260 --> 09:42.620
got going. Streaming a game from the cloud isn't like streaming music or movies. Those are linear

09:42.620 --> 09:47.860
experiences that don't require split second input from the end user. This is a fundamental problem

09:47.860 --> 09:52.420
that won't be solved for a while considering current advancement internet speeds. All other

09:52.500 --> 09:56.380
cloud gaming services suffer from the same issues. The cloud versions of games on the switch,

09:56.380 --> 10:00.300
the PlayStation Plus cloud stuff, Amazon's Luna, Xbox Game Pass, Nvidia, all of it,

10:00.300 --> 10:05.060
all of them suffer from the same one-two punch of latency destroying game experiences and you

10:05.060 --> 10:09.820
losing your purchases and save games when the service eventually dies. At least with PlayStation

10:09.820 --> 10:14.300
Plus and Xbox Game Pass though, it actually functions like a Netflix. You pay your monthly fee

10:14.300 --> 10:18.580
and you can just play rotating selection of games and you can download them to your local hardware

10:18.580 --> 10:22.100
so you're not trying to play over the internet too. How many times has Google done this? Google

10:22.100 --> 10:26.100
Hangouts, Google Plus, Google Glass, Google Answers, Google Buzz, large chunks of Google Play.

10:26.100 --> 10:29.980
There's so much shit Google has invested in and then just dumped even when it worked very well

10:29.980 --> 10:33.820
like Hangouts and Google Reader. Well with the death of the Stadia, we finally got an inside

10:33.820 --> 10:37.700
leak as to why this keeps happening. The career progression and promotion at Google is based on

10:37.700 --> 10:42.100
moving the needle aka launches. You launch a service or a major overhaul and you put it in

10:42.100 --> 10:45.540
your promo package. No one ever fucking gets promoted for maintaining or fixing something

10:45.540 --> 10:49.300
broken. No, it's all about launching products. When something like Stadia or any other Google

10:49.300 --> 10:52.980
service launches, you always see an immediate slowdown in development and features. It's because

10:52.980 --> 10:56.860
all experienced and ambitious engineers leave the project very shortly after launch because there's

10:56.860 --> 11:00.340
no promo food to get anymore. So they leave for a new project or team where they can get more

11:00.340 --> 11:05.020
credits towards promo. The people that remain are those that can't easily transfer aka inexperienced

11:05.020 --> 11:08.940
or poor engineers. You see this all the time with Google products. Rapid development and activity

11:08.940 --> 11:12.740
until the launch and then everything grinds to a halt. When I worked at Google in 2012, internally

11:12.740 --> 11:17.540
we called it LPA, Launch, Promo, Abandon. Yes, this is how we described it internally at Google.

11:17.580 --> 11:21.860
Another insider at Google echoed the sentiment. Google features zero penalties for fucking shit

11:21.860 --> 11:25.180
up. Do you know what the people who wasted two years on Google Allo got after it was canned?

11:25.180 --> 11:29.540
Nothing. Some got promoted. Google greatly encourages launches, releasing something publicly.

11:29.540 --> 11:33.420
And keep in mind, no penalties if this shit is half-baked, not working, only working on Chrome

11:33.420 --> 11:37.300
or some such nonsense. This is the norm. Why? Promotion. You can't get promoted beyond a certain

11:37.300 --> 11:40.180
level in this place unless you launch something big. What do you get when you add all these

11:40.180 --> 11:45.900
perverse incentives? 9,883 chat apps and a never-ending chain of redesigns and relaunches

11:45.900 --> 11:49.380
so some people can get promoted. You know how many bugs you need to fix to get promoted? Infinity.

11:49.380 --> 11:52.820
No matter how many you fix, it will never get you enough impact for promotion. How many useless

11:52.820 --> 11:57.220
redesigns you need to launch to get promoted? One. People internally usually warn about this

11:57.220 --> 12:00.940
shit, complain about it, file bugs about performance, et cetera. It's all ignored. Most people who have

12:00.940 --> 12:04.220
been here for over a few years have given up filing bugs because their reply is always the

12:04.220 --> 12:07.920
same. You're not the target audience and we all know it. Some quit when they realize it. Others

12:07.920 --> 12:11.500
begin optimizing promotion as opposed to optimizing for it as good for the user or the company. And

12:11.500 --> 12:15.540
this is how you get the new Gmail, for example. Google looks like on the outside, the 2020s

12:15.580 --> 12:20.140
equivalent of Blockbuster Video grew too fast, too quickly, isn't adapting to its own size,

12:20.140 --> 12:24.140
isn't cutting out the rot within its own company and culture. At the top, Google thinks it can do

12:24.140 --> 12:28.140
no wrong. It is the axis in which the world turns. Anything that the Google label slapped onto it

12:28.140 --> 12:32.300
must be good. And if there's problems, it's other people sabotaging it. At the bottom, though,

12:32.300 --> 12:36.140
Google is filled with people existing within the husk of a once functional institution,

12:36.140 --> 12:40.940
fighting over scraps, focusing only on building one person's staircases for themselves rather

12:40.940 --> 12:44.860
than actually fixing the place up. The Google Stadia disaster was inevitable and I'm glad I

12:44.860 --> 12:49.060
didn't get on board, even just showing off the shit show on my gaming stream. I don't think it

12:49.060 --> 12:52.500
would have been worth it for me, frankly. Oh, well, Stadia subjects are making the migration

12:52.500 --> 12:57.460
over to Amazon's cloud gaming service, the Amazon Luna. Surely the exact same shit won't happen

12:57.460 --> 12:58.580
again. This'll be fine.
