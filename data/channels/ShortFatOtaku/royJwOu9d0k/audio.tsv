0	16920	Google Stadia is dead, and thank god for that. For those of you who don't know, Google Stadia
16920	20480	was Google's attempt to enter into the cloud gaming market. Uh-huh, for those of you who
20480	24200	don't know what that is, cloud gaming is where the video game you're playing is physically
24200	29000	hosted somewhere very far away. Here's the most simplistic, boomer-friendly explanation.
29000	33240	You know how, back in the 1980s, if you were gonna play a video game, maybe you had a Nintendo,
33240	36720	maybe you had an old computer, the game would appear on the TV or the monitor, but the game
36720	40520	itself would be running on the hardware of the PC or the NES. The latency between the
40520	44900	device generating the game and the image output on the screen is virtually zero because they're
44900	49560	right beside each other. As technology advanced, people tried and failed to invent working
49560	53680	wireless controllers so you could play video games from further away. Infrared controllers
53680	58280	needed a direct line of sight and could be blocked by a passing dust mote, while primitive
58280	62600	pre-Bluetooth tech of the 90s added way too much latency. You'd press a button on the
62600	66520	controller and the action in the game might happen a full second later. It was only with
66520	70580	the invention of the Wavebird controller for the Nintendo GameCube that wireless controller
70580	75600	technology matured enough to actually be on par with a wired experience. What cloud gaming
75600	79360	is, is when the device running your game, the console or the computer, isn't in your
79360	84200	living room but is instead potentially thousands of miles away at one of Google's data centers.
84200	88080	The upside of this idea is that you don't have to buy your own console or PC anymore.
88080	91520	You can simply connect to the Google Stadia service, pay a monthly subscription fee and
91520	95300	have the games streamed over the internet to your TV screen. Stadia was technically
95300	99900	available on any device that could run a Google Chrome browser. PCs, phones, tablets, TVs,
99900	103640	and if for some reason your TV couldn't run it, you could buy a little Google Stadia
103640	108720	broadcaster dongly thing that clips onto the TV. The cost of actually building or owning
108720	112300	the expensive hardware that runs the game is collectivized. Rather than having your
112300	116760	brand new PS5 sit there idle when you're not using it, if all the raw hardware is stored
116760	120600	at Google's data centers, it can simply be repurposed for somebody else's game.
120600	125300	However, intuitively, it's not hard to understand how this is a bad idea in terms of the actual
125300	129620	experience of playing the game. If you think that latency was bad with primitive wireless
129620	133400	controllers when you were sitting just a bit too far away from the screen, imagine latency
133400	136620	when your game is being played on the other side of the country and transmitted over the
136620	140580	internet. According to Google though, there was no latency. In fact, it was better than
140580	144840	playing the game in your own home due to what they called negative latency. What this actually
144840	149480	is, was a buffer of predicted latency inherent to a Stadia player's setup or connection in
149480	154500	which the Stadia system will run lag mitigation. This can include increasing FPS rapidly to
154500	159840	reduce latency between player input and display or even predicting user inputs. Yes, Google
159840	163660	Stadia included AI learning that would come to predict your button presses and execute
163660	167180	them before you did in game, back on their home server, making it feel like you were
167180	170480	the one pressing the button at home, but it was them. They were literally going to have
170480	175100	the game play itself to overcome the natural limitations of their own business model.
175100	179100	Stadia launched in late 2019, and it was pretty obvious to everyone that it was going to be
179100	182280	a bomb before you even got out there. That didn't stop them from trying, and initial
182280	186700	reviews all voiced the same complaints that we had all predicted. Latency with the games
186700	191300	was horrible, with the new Mortal Kombat game in particular being virtually unplayable,
191300	195500	featuring several seconds of delay between input and action, making combos and fatalities
195500	199860	impossible to pull off. Google blamed this not on their hardware or on the internet,
199860	203000	but on the developers who made the games, saying they just didn't know how to do it
203000	207280	right on their revolutionary new product. After all, their hardware was more powerful
207280	211580	than the PS4 Pro or the Xbox One X. They've got the 4K gaming experience, as long as you
211580	215280	bought the Premium subscription. It's everyone else's fault it wasn't working. Developers
215280	219240	of course had their own take. Google, frankly, didn't pay them enough to get their games
219240	223520	working on Stadia. Game selection at launch was also not great. The Stadia started its
223520	228320	life with 22 games available, which isn't bad, but they were almost entirely ports of
228320	232900	games that were several years old. No exclusives and very few new titles. And a lot of shit
232900	238300	just didn't work. Family sharing didn't work. Achievements didn't work. Stadia on iOS didn't
238300	242060	work. And on some versions of Chromecast, another Google product, in fact the prime
242060	246500	Google product for this service, Stadia didn't work. For some people, Stadia itself didn't
246500	250440	work, as Google failed to provide invite codes with their Stadia subscriptions. And worst
250440	254300	of all, in my opinion, was the announcement that Google Stadia games would still cost
254300	258240	full price, alongside buying the controller and paying the subscription fee to access
258240	262320	the service. Stadia was compared to Netflix because Netflix's model is similar. You don't
262320	265580	own the movie or the show, it's stored on the Netflix servers and transmitted to you
265580	268920	over the internet, just like the games you play on Stadia. But this is like, in addition
268920	272620	to buying the TV and paying for the internet service and paying for your Netflix subscription,
272620	277040	you had to pay for every movie or show on Netflix you watched. You own them, and that
277040	280060	they're in your library on Netflix, but it's not like you own the physical copy. That's
280060	284120	what Stadia was doing. As the service began to mature, people began to take notice of
284120	287600	the slow trickle of new games coming out, as well as the lack of improvements to actually
287600	291920	make the service, you know, work. The latency problem never really got solved, and the games
291920	295820	were shadows of what they were on other platforms. The system's best exclusive game was Super
295820	301000	Bomberman R Online, and that moved off Stadia in early 2021, just to try and stay alive.
301000	304840	Funnily enough, an editor at Game Informer was told by a Stadia rep that Super Bomberman
304840	308360	R Online could never come out on another platform because of the fundamental way the game was
308360	312040	programmed. There was also weird oddities that just made people think that Google had
312040	315720	no idea what they were doing. Like how the Stadia profile page included areas to input
315720	321300	your ICQ number, AIM scream name, MSN messenger, and Yahoo ID. All services that went the way
321300	325700	of the dodo a decade ago. I remember using this shit in high school. Google hand-waved
325700	332400	everything by going back to that dry old well of video games controversy. Yes, thank you,
332400	336100	Frost, don't worry, your time will come on this channel. Google vows to fight abuse that
336100	339980	could pop up in Stadia communities. Google wants to prevent its new Stadia from being
339980	344220	filled up with racists, bigots, and trolls who congregate online. Like, listen to how
344220	348700	this is framed. Creating the community could also open the door to abusive conduct and
348700	352900	content, a problem that already plagues Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social media platforms.
352900	356980	Tech platforms are under intense scrutiny for failing to police what happens on their
356980	360580	services. Google wants to make sure the problems don't reappear on Stadia. They view the internet
360580	364860	itself as inherently a racist place. They view their own audience as a problem that
364860	369900	needs to be solved. The actual issue is that people are inherently rowdy and edgy and judgey
369900	373220	and shitposty, and that's not going to go away with a bit of social engineering from
373220	377700	Google. People simply won't use your service. And of course, the old boogeyman is brought
377700	382100	up. Discord, a chat app for gamers, has been criticized for being what some say is a safe
382100	386780	place for white supremacists and anti-Semites. Gamergate, an online movement that gained
386780	393540	steam in 2014, pushed some of the sexist and racist tropes of prevalent in gaming culture.
393540	397860	Jesus, CNET, do you proofread your shit before publishing it? It's no surprise that this
397860	401540	is the direction Google went with Stadia, as it's the direction they go company-wide.
401540	405700	Woke nonsense force-fed to all employees through diversity training seminars and other garbage
405700	410260	like that. A lot of the more moronic Stadia-related decisions can be understood through this lens.
410260	414880	Like for example, Google's press packages including an emphasis on what they call gender-neutral
414880	419900	controllers to appeal to women. What exactly made the Google Stadia controller gender-neutral?
419900	424460	Well they made it in green. That's literally it. I don't know about you, but different
424460	428660	colored controllers, including green, have been Nintendo's thing since the 90s. I don't
428660	432220	think it's progressive or revolutionary. Maybe you have to slap that label on if it
432220	436260	really counts. All of the complaints and issues were covered up on the subreddit r slash Stadia
436260	440740	because all the moderators of that sub were Google employees. Seriously, Google runs the
440740	445220	fan communities of the Stadia and spent the lifespan of the Stadia purging all the bad
445220	449760	press and negative customer responses. Despite this though, fan complaints still kept getting
449760	453380	through and going viral because there were just so many of them. Like pause the video
453380	456860	and read some of these for yourself. Look at this one. They just hit the online player
456860	462500	limit of 16 people in a single game of grid for the first time. Usually, nobody is playing
462500	467380	anything on the Stadia. This was back in January of 2020, two months after launch. The service
467380	471680	was dead before it even got off the ground. That didn't stop them from simultaneously
471680	476700	announcing expansion plans in March and a free pass in April. Guys, stop throwing money
476700	481380	into this black hole. It was no surprise to anyone that Google announced the final shutdown
481380	485560	of Stadia a few weeks ago. The only surprise is that the service managed to limp along
485560	490700	as far as it did. It will finally close its doors in early 2023, just past the three year
490700	494560	mark. It was really funny as the last few Stadia users began to notice that Google had
494560	497820	stopped talking about the Stadia, stopped updating it, was no longer moderating the
497820	501420	subreddit, was no longer replying to anyone, and they had purchased all of these games
501420	504300	that might be disappearing soon. What was going to happen to their money and their saves
504300	508660	and their games? I've always been a proponent of owning physical copies of games where possible
508660	512580	to avoid bullshit like this, but Google actually surprised everyone, saying that they would
512580	516600	all get a refund of their games purchases when the service finally closed down. Some
516600	520860	companies are offering transfer services to move gamers save files off Stadia to a different
520860	524300	platform, but for other people they're just shit out of luck. As Stadia closes its doors,
524300	528140	the subreddit has gotten really weird. Like check this out, rest in peace Google Stadia,
528140	531940	you're awesome. Cloud gaming is sustainable gaming. Why are we using environmentalist
531940	535980	activist language here? The bottom of the post reads, the savings in hardware cost,
535980	540460	distribution, energy use, etc that cloud gaming provides because infrastructure is shared doesn't
540460	544980	need a cool box and stands in an efficient data center should almost make it a requirement for
544980	550340	all next-gen games. Why let people buy an expensive box they hardly play when they can use it in the
550340	554940	cloud? Cloud gaming is sustainable gaming. You hear that pleb? The next part of live in the pod
554940	559260	and eat the bugs is gonna be play on the cloud. You don't need to own your own stuff, just rent
559260	563340	it from the data center. It's more sustainable. Stop being so selfish and wanting, you know,
563380	569460	your own PlayStation. Google spent a lot of time and I mean a lot trying to reassure gamers that
569460	573860	Stadia was here to stay, but it was all bullshit blowing smoke up everyone's ass hoping that their
573860	578260	shitty product would catch on, but it never did. We all predicted Stadia's failure before it even
578260	582620	got going. Streaming a game from the cloud isn't like streaming music or movies. Those are linear
582620	587860	experiences that don't require split second input from the end user. This is a fundamental problem
587860	592420	that won't be solved for a while considering current advancement internet speeds. All other
592500	596380	cloud gaming services suffer from the same issues. The cloud versions of games on the switch,
596380	600300	the PlayStation Plus cloud stuff, Amazon's Luna, Xbox Game Pass, Nvidia, all of it,
600300	605060	all of them suffer from the same one-two punch of latency destroying game experiences and you
605060	609820	losing your purchases and save games when the service eventually dies. At least with PlayStation
609820	614300	Plus and Xbox Game Pass though, it actually functions like a Netflix. You pay your monthly fee
614300	618580	and you can just play rotating selection of games and you can download them to your local hardware
618580	622100	so you're not trying to play over the internet too. How many times has Google done this? Google
622100	626100	Hangouts, Google Plus, Google Glass, Google Answers, Google Buzz, large chunks of Google Play.
626100	629980	There's so much shit Google has invested in and then just dumped even when it worked very well
629980	633820	like Hangouts and Google Reader. Well with the death of the Stadia, we finally got an inside
633820	637700	leak as to why this keeps happening. The career progression and promotion at Google is based on
637700	642100	moving the needle aka launches. You launch a service or a major overhaul and you put it in
642100	645540	your promo package. No one ever fucking gets promoted for maintaining or fixing something
645540	649300	broken. No, it's all about launching products. When something like Stadia or any other Google
649300	652980	service launches, you always see an immediate slowdown in development and features. It's because
652980	656860	all experienced and ambitious engineers leave the project very shortly after launch because there's
656860	660340	no promo food to get anymore. So they leave for a new project or team where they can get more
660340	665020	credits towards promo. The people that remain are those that can't easily transfer aka inexperienced
665020	668940	or poor engineers. You see this all the time with Google products. Rapid development and activity
668940	672740	until the launch and then everything grinds to a halt. When I worked at Google in 2012, internally
672740	677540	we called it LPA, Launch, Promo, Abandon. Yes, this is how we described it internally at Google.
677580	681860	Another insider at Google echoed the sentiment. Google features zero penalties for fucking shit
681860	685180	up. Do you know what the people who wasted two years on Google Allo got after it was canned?
685180	689540	Nothing. Some got promoted. Google greatly encourages launches, releasing something publicly.
689540	693420	And keep in mind, no penalties if this shit is half-baked, not working, only working on Chrome
693420	697300	or some such nonsense. This is the norm. Why? Promotion. You can't get promoted beyond a certain
697300	700180	level in this place unless you launch something big. What do you get when you add all these
700180	705900	perverse incentives? 9,883 chat apps and a never-ending chain of redesigns and relaunches
705900	709380	so some people can get promoted. You know how many bugs you need to fix to get promoted? Infinity.
709380	712820	No matter how many you fix, it will never get you enough impact for promotion. How many useless
712820	717220	redesigns you need to launch to get promoted? One. People internally usually warn about this
717220	720940	shit, complain about it, file bugs about performance, et cetera. It's all ignored. Most people who have
720940	724220	been here for over a few years have given up filing bugs because their reply is always the
724220	727920	same. You're not the target audience and we all know it. Some quit when they realize it. Others
727920	731500	begin optimizing promotion as opposed to optimizing for it as good for the user or the company. And
731500	735540	this is how you get the new Gmail, for example. Google looks like on the outside, the 2020s
735580	740140	equivalent of Blockbuster Video grew too fast, too quickly, isn't adapting to its own size,
740140	744140	isn't cutting out the rot within its own company and culture. At the top, Google thinks it can do
744140	748140	no wrong. It is the axis in which the world turns. Anything that the Google label slapped onto it
748140	752300	must be good. And if there's problems, it's other people sabotaging it. At the bottom, though,
752300	756140	Google is filled with people existing within the husk of a once functional institution,
756140	760940	fighting over scraps, focusing only on building one person's staircases for themselves rather
760940	764860	than actually fixing the place up. The Google Stadia disaster was inevitable and I'm glad I
764860	769060	didn't get on board, even just showing off the shit show on my gaming stream. I don't think it
769060	772500	would have been worth it for me, frankly. Oh, well, Stadia subjects are making the migration
772500	777460	over to Amazon's cloud gaming service, the Amazon Luna. Surely the exact same shit won't happen
777460	778580	again. This'll be fine.
