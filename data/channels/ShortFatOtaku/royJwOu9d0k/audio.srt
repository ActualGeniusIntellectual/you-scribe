1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,920
Google Stadia is dead, and thank god for that. For those of you who don't know, Google Stadia

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,480
was Google's attempt to enter into the cloud gaming market. Uh-huh, for those of you who

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,200
don't know what that is, cloud gaming is where the video game you're playing is physically

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,000
hosted somewhere very far away. Here's the most simplistic, boomer-friendly explanation.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,240
You know how, back in the 1980s, if you were gonna play a video game, maybe you had a Nintendo,

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,720
maybe you had an old computer, the game would appear on the TV or the monitor, but the game

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,520
itself would be running on the hardware of the PC or the NES. The latency between the

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,900
device generating the game and the image output on the screen is virtually zero because they're

9
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,560
right beside each other. As technology advanced, people tried and failed to invent working

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,680
wireless controllers so you could play video games from further away. Infrared controllers

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,280
needed a direct line of sight and could be blocked by a passing dust mote, while primitive

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,600
pre-Bluetooth tech of the 90s added way too much latency. You'd press a button on the

13
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,520
controller and the action in the game might happen a full second later. It was only with

14
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,580
the invention of the Wavebird controller for the Nintendo GameCube that wireless controller

15
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,600
technology matured enough to actually be on par with a wired experience. What cloud gaming

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,360
is, is when the device running your game, the console or the computer, isn't in your

17
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,200
living room but is instead potentially thousands of miles away at one of Google's data centers.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,080
The upside of this idea is that you don't have to buy your own console or PC anymore.

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,520
You can simply connect to the Google Stadia service, pay a monthly subscription fee and

20
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,300
have the games streamed over the internet to your TV screen. Stadia was technically

21
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,900
available on any device that could run a Google Chrome browser. PCs, phones, tablets, TVs,

22
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,640
and if for some reason your TV couldn't run it, you could buy a little Google Stadia

23
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,720
broadcaster dongly thing that clips onto the TV. The cost of actually building or owning

24
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,300
the expensive hardware that runs the game is collectivized. Rather than having your

25
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,760
brand new PS5 sit there idle when you're not using it, if all the raw hardware is stored

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,600
at Google's data centers, it can simply be repurposed for somebody else's game.

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,300
However, intuitively, it's not hard to understand how this is a bad idea in terms of the actual

28
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,620
experience of playing the game. If you think that latency was bad with primitive wireless

29
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,400
controllers when you were sitting just a bit too far away from the screen, imagine latency

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,620
when your game is being played on the other side of the country and transmitted over the

31
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,580
internet. According to Google though, there was no latency. In fact, it was better than

32
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,840
playing the game in your own home due to what they called negative latency. What this actually

33
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,480
is, was a buffer of predicted latency inherent to a Stadia player's setup or connection in

34
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,500
which the Stadia system will run lag mitigation. This can include increasing FPS rapidly to

35
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,840
reduce latency between player input and display or even predicting user inputs. Yes, Google

36
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,660
Stadia included AI learning that would come to predict your button presses and execute

37
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,180
them before you did in game, back on their home server, making it feel like you were

38
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,480
the one pressing the button at home, but it was them. They were literally going to have

39
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,100
the game play itself to overcome the natural limitations of their own business model.

40
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,100
Stadia launched in late 2019, and it was pretty obvious to everyone that it was going to be

41
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,280
a bomb before you even got out there. That didn't stop them from trying, and initial

42
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,700
reviews all voiced the same complaints that we had all predicted. Latency with the games

43
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,300
was horrible, with the new Mortal Kombat game in particular being virtually unplayable,

44
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,500
featuring several seconds of delay between input and action, making combos and fatalities

45
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,860
impossible to pull off. Google blamed this not on their hardware or on the internet,

46
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,000
but on the developers who made the games, saying they just didn't know how to do it

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,280
right on their revolutionary new product. After all, their hardware was more powerful

48
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,580
than the PS4 Pro or the Xbox One X. They've got the 4K gaming experience, as long as you

49
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,280
bought the Premium subscription. It's everyone else's fault it wasn't working. Developers

50
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,240
of course had their own take. Google, frankly, didn't pay them enough to get their games

51
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,520
working on Stadia. Game selection at launch was also not great. The Stadia started its

52
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,320
life with 22 games available, which isn't bad, but they were almost entirely ports of

53
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,900
games that were several years old. No exclusives and very few new titles. And a lot of shit

54
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,300
just didn't work. Family sharing didn't work. Achievements didn't work. Stadia on iOS didn't

55
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,060
work. And on some versions of Chromecast, another Google product, in fact the prime

56
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,500
Google product for this service, Stadia didn't work. For some people, Stadia itself didn't

57
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,440
work, as Google failed to provide invite codes with their Stadia subscriptions. And worst

58
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,300
of all, in my opinion, was the announcement that Google Stadia games would still cost

59
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,240
full price, alongside buying the controller and paying the subscription fee to access

60
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,320
the service. Stadia was compared to Netflix because Netflix's model is similar. You don't

61
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,580
own the movie or the show, it's stored on the Netflix servers and transmitted to you

62
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,920
over the internet, just like the games you play on Stadia. But this is like, in addition

63
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,620
to buying the TV and paying for the internet service and paying for your Netflix subscription,

64
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,040
you had to pay for every movie or show on Netflix you watched. You own them, and that

65
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,060
they're in your library on Netflix, but it's not like you own the physical copy. That's

66
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,120
what Stadia was doing. As the service began to mature, people began to take notice of

67
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,600
the slow trickle of new games coming out, as well as the lack of improvements to actually

68
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,920
make the service, you know, work. The latency problem never really got solved, and the games

69
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,820
were shadows of what they were on other platforms. The system's best exclusive game was Super

70
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:01,000
Bomberman R Online, and that moved off Stadia in early 2021, just to try and stay alive.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,840
Funnily enough, an editor at Game Informer was told by a Stadia rep that Super Bomberman

72
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,360
R Online could never come out on another platform because of the fundamental way the game was

73
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,040
programmed. There was also weird oddities that just made people think that Google had

74
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,720
no idea what they were doing. Like how the Stadia profile page included areas to input

75
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,300
your ICQ number, AIM scream name, MSN messenger, and Yahoo ID. All services that went the way

76
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,700
of the dodo a decade ago. I remember using this shit in high school. Google hand-waved

77
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:32,400
everything by going back to that dry old well of video games controversy. Yes, thank you,

78
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,100
Frost, don't worry, your time will come on this channel. Google vows to fight abuse that

79
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,980
could pop up in Stadia communities. Google wants to prevent its new Stadia from being

80
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,220
filled up with racists, bigots, and trolls who congregate online. Like, listen to how

81
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,700
this is framed. Creating the community could also open the door to abusive conduct and

82
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,900
content, a problem that already plagues Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social media platforms.

83
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,980
Tech platforms are under intense scrutiny for failing to police what happens on their

84
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,580
services. Google wants to make sure the problems don't reappear on Stadia. They view the internet

85
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,860
itself as inherently a racist place. They view their own audience as a problem that

86
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,900
needs to be solved. The actual issue is that people are inherently rowdy and edgy and judgey

87
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,220
and shitposty, and that's not going to go away with a bit of social engineering from

88
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,700
Google. People simply won't use your service. And of course, the old boogeyman is brought

89
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,100
up. Discord, a chat app for gamers, has been criticized for being what some say is a safe

90
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,780
place for white supremacists and anti-Semites. Gamergate, an online movement that gained

91
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:33,540
steam in 2014, pushed some of the sexist and racist tropes of prevalent in gaming culture.

92
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,860
Jesus, CNET, do you proofread your shit before publishing it? It's no surprise that this

93
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,540
is the direction Google went with Stadia, as it's the direction they go company-wide.

94
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,700
Woke nonsense force-fed to all employees through diversity training seminars and other garbage

95
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,260
like that. A lot of the more moronic Stadia-related decisions can be understood through this lens.

96
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,880
Like for example, Google's press packages including an emphasis on what they call gender-neutral

97
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,900
controllers to appeal to women. What exactly made the Google Stadia controller gender-neutral?

98
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,460
Well they made it in green. That's literally it. I don't know about you, but different

99
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,660
colored controllers, including green, have been Nintendo's thing since the 90s. I don't

100
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,220
think it's progressive or revolutionary. Maybe you have to slap that label on if it

101
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,260
really counts. All of the complaints and issues were covered up on the subreddit r slash Stadia

102
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,740
because all the moderators of that sub were Google employees. Seriously, Google runs the

103
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,220
fan communities of the Stadia and spent the lifespan of the Stadia purging all the bad

104
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,760
press and negative customer responses. Despite this though, fan complaints still kept getting

105
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,380
through and going viral because there were just so many of them. Like pause the video

106
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,860
and read some of these for yourself. Look at this one. They just hit the online player

107
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:42,500
limit of 16 people in a single game of grid for the first time. Usually, nobody is playing

108
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,380
anything on the Stadia. This was back in January of 2020, two months after launch. The service

109
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,680
was dead before it even got off the ground. That didn't stop them from simultaneously

110
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,700
announcing expansion plans in March and a free pass in April. Guys, stop throwing money

111
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,380
into this black hole. It was no surprise to anyone that Google announced the final shutdown

112
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,560
of Stadia a few weeks ago. The only surprise is that the service managed to limp along

113
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,700
as far as it did. It will finally close its doors in early 2023, just past the three year

114
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,560
mark. It was really funny as the last few Stadia users began to notice that Google had

115
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,820
stopped talking about the Stadia, stopped updating it, was no longer moderating the

116
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,420
subreddit, was no longer replying to anyone, and they had purchased all of these games

117
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,300
that might be disappearing soon. What was going to happen to their money and their saves

118
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,660
and their games? I've always been a proponent of owning physical copies of games where possible

119
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,580
to avoid bullshit like this, but Google actually surprised everyone, saying that they would

120
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,600
all get a refund of their games purchases when the service finally closed down. Some

121
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,860
companies are offering transfer services to move gamers save files off Stadia to a different

122
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,300
platform, but for other people they're just shit out of luck. As Stadia closes its doors,

123
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,140
the subreddit has gotten really weird. Like check this out, rest in peace Google Stadia,

124
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,940
you're awesome. Cloud gaming is sustainable gaming. Why are we using environmentalist

125
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,980
activist language here? The bottom of the post reads, the savings in hardware cost,

126
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,460
distribution, energy use, etc that cloud gaming provides because infrastructure is shared doesn't

127
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,980
need a cool box and stands in an efficient data center should almost make it a requirement for

128
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,340
all next-gen games. Why let people buy an expensive box they hardly play when they can use it in the

129
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,940
cloud? Cloud gaming is sustainable gaming. You hear that pleb? The next part of live in the pod

130
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,260
and eat the bugs is gonna be play on the cloud. You don't need to own your own stuff, just rent

131
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,340
it from the data center. It's more sustainable. Stop being so selfish and wanting, you know,

132
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:29,460
your own PlayStation. Google spent a lot of time and I mean a lot trying to reassure gamers that

133
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,860
Stadia was here to stay, but it was all bullshit blowing smoke up everyone's ass hoping that their

134
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,260
shitty product would catch on, but it never did. We all predicted Stadia's failure before it even

135
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,620
got going. Streaming a game from the cloud isn't like streaming music or movies. Those are linear

136
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,860
experiences that don't require split second input from the end user. This is a fundamental problem

137
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,420
that won't be solved for a while considering current advancement internet speeds. All other

138
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,380
cloud gaming services suffer from the same issues. The cloud versions of games on the switch,

139
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,300
the PlayStation Plus cloud stuff, Amazon's Luna, Xbox Game Pass, Nvidia, all of it,

140
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,060
all of them suffer from the same one-two punch of latency destroying game experiences and you

141
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,820
losing your purchases and save games when the service eventually dies. At least with PlayStation

142
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,300
Plus and Xbox Game Pass though, it actually functions like a Netflix. You pay your monthly fee

143
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,580
and you can just play rotating selection of games and you can download them to your local hardware

144
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,100
so you're not trying to play over the internet too. How many times has Google done this? Google

145
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,100
Hangouts, Google Plus, Google Glass, Google Answers, Google Buzz, large chunks of Google Play.

146
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,980
There's so much shit Google has invested in and then just dumped even when it worked very well

147
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,820
like Hangouts and Google Reader. Well with the death of the Stadia, we finally got an inside

148
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,700
leak as to why this keeps happening. The career progression and promotion at Google is based on

149
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,100
moving the needle aka launches. You launch a service or a major overhaul and you put it in

150
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,540
your promo package. No one ever fucking gets promoted for maintaining or fixing something

151
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,300
broken. No, it's all about launching products. When something like Stadia or any other Google

152
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,980
service launches, you always see an immediate slowdown in development and features. It's because

153
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,860
all experienced and ambitious engineers leave the project very shortly after launch because there's

154
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,340
no promo food to get anymore. So they leave for a new project or team where they can get more

155
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,020
credits towards promo. The people that remain are those that can't easily transfer aka inexperienced

156
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,940
or poor engineers. You see this all the time with Google products. Rapid development and activity

157
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,740
until the launch and then everything grinds to a halt. When I worked at Google in 2012, internally

158
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,540
we called it LPA, Launch, Promo, Abandon. Yes, this is how we described it internally at Google.

159
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:21,860
Another insider at Google echoed the sentiment. Google features zero penalties for fucking shit

160
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,180
up. Do you know what the people who wasted two years on Google Allo got after it was canned?

161
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,540
Nothing. Some got promoted. Google greatly encourages launches, releasing something publicly.

162
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,420
And keep in mind, no penalties if this shit is half-baked, not working, only working on Chrome

163
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,300
or some such nonsense. This is the norm. Why? Promotion. You can't get promoted beyond a certain

164
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,180
level in this place unless you launch something big. What do you get when you add all these

165
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:45,900
perverse incentives? 9,883 chat apps and a never-ending chain of redesigns and relaunches

166
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,380
so some people can get promoted. You know how many bugs you need to fix to get promoted? Infinity.

167
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,820
No matter how many you fix, it will never get you enough impact for promotion. How many useless

168
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:57,220
redesigns you need to launch to get promoted? One. People internally usually warn about this

169
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,940
shit, complain about it, file bugs about performance, et cetera. It's all ignored. Most people who have

170
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,220
been here for over a few years have given up filing bugs because their reply is always the

171
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,920
same. You're not the target audience and we all know it. Some quit when they realize it. Others

172
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,500
begin optimizing promotion as opposed to optimizing for it as good for the user or the company. And

173
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,540
this is how you get the new Gmail, for example. Google looks like on the outside, the 2020s

174
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,140
equivalent of Blockbuster Video grew too fast, too quickly, isn't adapting to its own size,

175
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,140
isn't cutting out the rot within its own company and culture. At the top, Google thinks it can do

176
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,140
no wrong. It is the axis in which the world turns. Anything that the Google label slapped onto it

177
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,300
must be good. And if there's problems, it's other people sabotaging it. At the bottom, though,

178
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,140
Google is filled with people existing within the husk of a once functional institution,

179
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,940
fighting over scraps, focusing only on building one person's staircases for themselves rather

180
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,860
than actually fixing the place up. The Google Stadia disaster was inevitable and I'm glad I

181
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,060
didn't get on board, even just showing off the shit show on my gaming stream. I don't think it

182
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,500
would have been worth it for me, frankly. Oh, well, Stadia subjects are making the migration

183
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,460
over to Amazon's cloud gaming service, the Amazon Luna. Surely the exact same shit won't happen

184
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,580
again. This'll be fine.
