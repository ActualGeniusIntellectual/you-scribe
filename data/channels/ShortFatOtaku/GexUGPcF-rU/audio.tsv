0	10640	So I'm getting some new artwork made so that Lilith and I can actually do more content
10640	18520	together that is outside of the the DWS podcast label and that's not ready yet so unfortunately
18520	23920	it's just me today but I do have to credit Lilith because she's done a lot of the legwork
23920	29340	on this topic and here's the topic a couple weeks ago there was a shooting in Colorado
29340	35300	and before we knew anything people started saying stuff like this it's horrible our nation
35300	41480	begins opening up and the shooting starts white male terrorist killers America we have
41480	46820	a problem another mass shooting today a white man has had a bad day it's become quite the
46820	51620	norm and without gun reform it will remain exactly that way I just heard that the suspect
51620	57500	in Colorado was taken alive at least we know he's white so when we inevitably find out
57500	62100	that the shooter is a white supremacist will conservatives finally admit that it's a problem
62100	66620	or is it gonna be like all the other times they sent their thoughts and prayers you gun toting
66620	70540	Second Amendment new index promoting that job responsible for these white supremacists doing
70540	75220	these mass shootings I'm trying to figure out why mass shooters always survive and end up in custody
75220	83220	and probably be taken to McDonald's oh yes I'll have the shooter special but men of color get
83300	88060	killed unarmed for a damn traffic stop and we do have this meme where it appears that the guy is
88060	92540	white ten people shot an officer killed and he gets a leisurely walk to the car George Floyd had
92540	98540	a counterfeit $20 bill and he was murdered by police this is privilege but it turns out it
98540	105740	wasn't white he was an Arab police identify 21 year old Ahmad al-allawi Alissa as suspect in
105740	112620	Boulder shooting oops and check out this flip-flopping guys police confirm at least six
112620	119420	dead and shooting the white male mass shooter was arrested alive hashtag where was he radicalized
119420	125460	another white male mass shooter who had a bad day and killed multiple people terrorized a community
125460	131340	and arrested alive never forget police absolutely know how to de-escalate and peacefully arrest even
131340	138340	the most violent culprits the next day police identify Ahmad Alissa as the terrorist who killed
138340	143580	the ten innocent people in Colorado yesterday unless you're interested in finally passing a
143580	149340	common-sense gun reform legislation I don't want to hear your excuses or responses oh it was all
149340	154460	about race before now the topics gun control what happened to the racial angle don't you want to
154460	159820	talk about this guy's race is there a conversation to be had there here's Amy six and the shooter is
159820	165940	was taken into custody um you might want to check your grammar there in other words it was almost
165980	171860	certainly a white man again if he were black or brown he would be dead oh is that the case
171860	177780	let's mourn the victims but not glorify the killer with the attention of having his name widely known
177780	184220	is it because the name isn't European Amy is is that where we're going with this of course
184220	189940	illin Omar is gonna say something stupid back in the Asian massage parlor shooting she said it
189940	194180	isn't hard to understand why it's so normalized for law enforcement to protect the humanity of
194180	198700	white mass murderers and their willingness to continually make excuses for them and then
198700	204260	regarding this mass shooting her tune seems to have changed the shooters race or ethnicity seems
204260	210420	front and center when they aren't white otherwise it's just a mentally ill young man having a bad
210420	216220	day are you sure that race and ethnicity is not front and center when they're white because uh
216220	223860	it seems to be so front and center that leftists are now immediately jumping to the conclusion
224060	229100	that they're white before there's any evidence of it extremely tired of people's lives depending
229100	235100	on whether a white man with an ar-15 is having a good day or not my inbox and DMS are full of
235100	240180	extremely upset white men who don't give a damn about mass shootings but are demanding I issue a
240180	246180	blanket apology to white men to which I say no it's completely fine to be racist towards white
246180	251700	people it's just punching up to say that all white men are shooters even when they're not and if you
251700	256820	think this is a problem with only the terminally verified you got another thing coming check out
256820	262980	the official Twitter trending page for the story before and after the race of the perpetrator came
262980	268180	out here's before people are comparing the arrests of the white male suspects at the center of the
268180	273740	recent shooting in Boulder and Atlanta to the 2019 death of unarmed black man Elijah McClain
273740	279660	white male of course and after suspect in Colorado shooting incident charged with first-degree
279860	284380	murder Boulder police confirm not a single mention of race I've said this before and I'll say it
284380	289700	again if 9-eleven happened today the media would tell us that there is no way we can possibly know
289700	294300	the motivations of the terrorists the checkmarks will tell us that we're racist for even asking
294300	299860	the question and the socialists will tell us that we deserved it anyway check this one out suspect
299860	306140	in Boulder not antifa BLM Muslim it's a white male when is our society gonna learn while I may
306140	311540	be wrong about the boulder shooting by a man who has an ethnic name no info about his religion
311540	317820	available it is a fact that the majority of mass shooters are white and male this is straight up
317820	324900	what about isn't and it's also factually inaccurate mass shootings dot info I can't believe that site
324900	330620	exists I guess we're at that point is a mass shooting database in 2020 in the United States
330620	339220	there were 612 mass shootings of those shootings 149 have known perpetrators of those 149 roughly
339220	344780	27 were white that's less than 1 5th and you may notice looking at this collage of people there
344780	350140	seems to be an an overwhelming amount of representation from one group and I won't say
350140	355740	anything more than that what the fuck is up with this guy's neck I see he stole it from this guy
355740	362340	so everybody assumed that Ahmad here was a white supremacist alt-right gamer Gator of course it
362340	366940	turns out he was actually a Muslim he ranted about Islamophobia online he reposted content
366940	372380	about mass migration and yes this is not simply a religion issue he was also very antisocial
372380	377780	paranoid and mentally ill it's very easy to radicalize people into anything whether that's
377780	384240	far-right terrorism Islamic terrorism in cell-based terrorism antifa based terrorism whatever if the
384240	389400	person in question is isolated or depressed now you think these idiots who have done this
389400	393440	nonsense would have learned their lesson right like this is just a couple weeks ago it was March
393440	400840	23rd or something but yesterday April 2nd there was another attack and the same type of people
400840	405600	did the exact same fucking thing this time the attack was at the US Capitol and the authorities
405600	410800	said that it did not appear to be terror related and look at these idiots fall for it again so he
410800	415800	was white so it was a white Trump supporter without having the slightest clue about the
415800	421400	security incident at the Capitol I'm gonna go ahead and call white nationalist terrorism on
421400	427080	this one someone Rams vehicle into officer and kills him at the US Capitol attacks others with
427080	432740	a knife apparently it's not terrorism related I don't know yet but I'm guessing that means the
432740	438480	suspect was white ah so they were white it's a white person I guess translation it was a white
438480	443320	guy who are all these no-name checkmarks I don't recognize a single one of these idiots and of
443320	449040	course it turned out to be a black man and more importantly than that a Nation of Islam follower
449040	454680	you know like the the Louis Farrakhan black supremacist types as soon as that came out to
454680	458920	check out what the journalists were saying multiple senior law enforcement officials
458920	464120	briefed on the investigation to say that Noah Greene a 25 year old male from Indiana is the
464120	469040	person who attacked the Capitol today reports say 25 year old Indiana man named Noah Greene
469040	475200	etc etc nobody's mentioning race nobody's mentioning ideology nobody's posting a picture and we know
475200	480600	for a fact this is the kind of stuff that they do if it's say a white in cell or something these
480600	486400	people just got bamboozled last week and then it happens again and they do the same fucking thing
486400	492760	again I wonder if you remember this shooting from September 24th 2017 deadly Tennessee Church
492760	499080	shooting Sudanese immigrant arrested a man named Emmanuel Cadega Sampson opened fire at a church
499080	505640	in Antioch Tennessee he shot six people killing one and was eventually stopped by a good guy with
505640	511040	a gun now the main reason you didn't hear about this shooting is because it happened at the exact
511040	516440	same time as the Las Vegas sniper and fair enough it's not just that the Las Vegas sniper was white
516440	521680	he managed to kill and hurt a lot more people in the fact that it was a sniper it was in a hotel
521680	526440	room there's more of a dramatic angle to the story there's the celebrity aspect because he
526440	531400	was shooting down into into a concert I think it's definitely a story that captures the imagination
531400	535320	more than others but nonetheless there were protests regarding the Las Vegas shootings
535320	539800	saying that it was white supremacist violence and white male rage and all this other nonsense
539800	546120	but nobody even said a peep about Tennessee shooting okay maybe it was just overshadowed
546120	550360	due to the sheer amount of dead involved fair enough we all know the George Floyd story right
550360	557040	knee on the neck Floyd dies in custody sparks a year of violent antifa riots well back in 2018
557040	563640	another man died in the exact same way that George Floyd did Timothy Kaufman a white person this time
563640	569640	was resisting arrest like Floyd put on the ground like Floyd and then need in the back of the neck
569640	575840	like Floyd until he died drugs were a factor in both deaths but in both deaths they still died in
575840	581200	police custody why did only one of these events trigger widespread protests okay okay okay maybe
581200	585920	it's just the fact that the public didn't know back in 2018 and now they know now that the George
585920	593640	Floyd thing has happened everyone knows February 22nd 2021 Angelo Quinto dies after the police
593640	600360	kneel on his neck for five minutes this is nearly a year after George Floyd did any of you even hear
600360	607520	of this story or was it simply buried because the victim was not of the right race now we can have
607520	612680	a different discussion on the responsibility of the police in these scenarios and that is a
612680	617160	legitimate discussion to have that is not the focus that is not the focus of this video but
617160	622040	it will be the focus of a future video the conversation today is about the hypocrisy
622040	628640	of selective outrage while it's never good for anybody to die in police custody it is very clear
628680	633480	that only a certain type of person has the privilege of being deified after their death
633480	639640	or having widespread protests happen regarding the injustice of their case or having widespread
639640	645600	violence and riots happen in their name and if you look at cases like Rayshard Brooks or Jacob Blake
645600	651440	which are in my opinion a lot more clear-cut on the side of the police you begin to realize
651440	657560	that the common variable is not police brutality at all but rather the race of the victim and you
657560	662240	know what it's not just white people as I've talked about in multiple videos recently black
662240	668080	on Asian crime has ramped up considerably and black on black crime is a far greater killer
668080	674040	than say white on black crime and yet according to the leftist view white people are still to blame
674040	679600	for that black on Asian crimes only occur because of our system of white supremacy that strips
679600	684900	african-americans of their economic opportunities while taking respect and dignity away from Asian
684900	691020	Americans yes of course of course so when these black activists walk into this Asian owned nail
691020	697180	salon in Milwaukee complete with matching black panther outfits this is Whitey's fault is it are
697180	702540	you so completely reluctant to hold black people responsible for anything that you will blame the
702540	711100	actions of black supremacists on white people the way the left treats race is absolute insanity it
711100	716380	seems to me that white privilege is having your death at the hands of the police go completely
716380	721900	unnoticed by our society at large thank you for watching my friends if you enjoyed this video
