1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
So I'm getting some new artwork made so that Lilith and I can actually do more content

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:18,520
together that is outside of the the DWS podcast label and that's not ready yet so unfortunately

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,920
it's just me today but I do have to credit Lilith because she's done a lot of the legwork

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,340
on this topic and here's the topic a couple weeks ago there was a shooting in Colorado

5
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,300
and before we knew anything people started saying stuff like this it's horrible our nation

6
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:41,480
begins opening up and the shooting starts white male terrorist killers America we have

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,820
a problem another mass shooting today a white man has had a bad day it's become quite the

8
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,620
norm and without gun reform it will remain exactly that way I just heard that the suspect

9
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:57,500
in Colorado was taken alive at least we know he's white so when we inevitably find out

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,100
that the shooter is a white supremacist will conservatives finally admit that it's a problem

11
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,620
or is it gonna be like all the other times they sent their thoughts and prayers you gun toting

12
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,540
Second Amendment new index promoting that job responsible for these white supremacists doing

13
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,220
these mass shootings I'm trying to figure out why mass shooters always survive and end up in custody

14
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:23,220
and probably be taken to McDonald's oh yes I'll have the shooter special but men of color get

15
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,060
killed unarmed for a damn traffic stop and we do have this meme where it appears that the guy is

16
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,540
white ten people shot an officer killed and he gets a leisurely walk to the car George Floyd had

17
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:38,540
a counterfeit $20 bill and he was murdered by police this is privilege but it turns out it

18
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:45,740
wasn't white he was an Arab police identify 21 year old Ahmad al-allawi Alissa as suspect in

19
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:52,620
Boulder shooting oops and check out this flip-flopping guys police confirm at least six

20
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:59,420
dead and shooting the white male mass shooter was arrested alive hashtag where was he radicalized

21
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:05,460
another white male mass shooter who had a bad day and killed multiple people terrorized a community

22
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,340
and arrested alive never forget police absolutely know how to de-escalate and peacefully arrest even

23
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:18,340
the most violent culprits the next day police identify Ahmad Alissa as the terrorist who killed

24
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,580
the ten innocent people in Colorado yesterday unless you're interested in finally passing a

25
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,340
common-sense gun reform legislation I don't want to hear your excuses or responses oh it was all

26
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,460
about race before now the topics gun control what happened to the racial angle don't you want to

27
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,820
talk about this guy's race is there a conversation to be had there here's Amy six and the shooter is

28
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:45,940
was taken into custody um you might want to check your grammar there in other words it was almost

29
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,860
certainly a white man again if he were black or brown he would be dead oh is that the case

30
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,780
let's mourn the victims but not glorify the killer with the attention of having his name widely known

31
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:04,220
is it because the name isn't European Amy is is that where we're going with this of course

32
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,940
illin Omar is gonna say something stupid back in the Asian massage parlor shooting she said it

33
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,180
isn't hard to understand why it's so normalized for law enforcement to protect the humanity of

34
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,700
white mass murderers and their willingness to continually make excuses for them and then

35
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:24,260
regarding this mass shooting her tune seems to have changed the shooters race or ethnicity seems

36
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:30,420
front and center when they aren't white otherwise it's just a mentally ill young man having a bad

37
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:36,220
day are you sure that race and ethnicity is not front and center when they're white because uh

38
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:43,860
it seems to be so front and center that leftists are now immediately jumping to the conclusion

39
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:49,100
that they're white before there's any evidence of it extremely tired of people's lives depending

40
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:55,100
on whether a white man with an ar-15 is having a good day or not my inbox and DMS are full of

41
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:00,180
extremely upset white men who don't give a damn about mass shootings but are demanding I issue a

42
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,180
blanket apology to white men to which I say no it's completely fine to be racist towards white

43
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,700
people it's just punching up to say that all white men are shooters even when they're not and if you

44
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,820
think this is a problem with only the terminally verified you got another thing coming check out

45
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:22,980
the official Twitter trending page for the story before and after the race of the perpetrator came

46
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,180
out here's before people are comparing the arrests of the white male suspects at the center of the

47
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,740
recent shooting in Boulder and Atlanta to the 2019 death of unarmed black man Elijah McClain

48
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,660
white male of course and after suspect in Colorado shooting incident charged with first-degree

49
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,380
murder Boulder police confirm not a single mention of race I've said this before and I'll say it

50
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,700
again if 9-eleven happened today the media would tell us that there is no way we can possibly know

51
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,300
the motivations of the terrorists the checkmarks will tell us that we're racist for even asking

52
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,860
the question and the socialists will tell us that we deserved it anyway check this one out suspect

53
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:06,140
in Boulder not antifa BLM Muslim it's a white male when is our society gonna learn while I may

54
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,540
be wrong about the boulder shooting by a man who has an ethnic name no info about his religion

55
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:17,820
available it is a fact that the majority of mass shooters are white and male this is straight up

56
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:24,900
what about isn't and it's also factually inaccurate mass shootings dot info I can't believe that site

57
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,620
exists I guess we're at that point is a mass shooting database in 2020 in the United States

58
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:39,220
there were 612 mass shootings of those shootings 149 have known perpetrators of those 149 roughly

59
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,780
27 were white that's less than 1 5th and you may notice looking at this collage of people there

60
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,140
seems to be an an overwhelming amount of representation from one group and I won't say

61
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:55,740
anything more than that what the fuck is up with this guy's neck I see he stole it from this guy

62
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:02,340
so everybody assumed that Ahmad here was a white supremacist alt-right gamer Gator of course it

63
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,940
turns out he was actually a Muslim he ranted about Islamophobia online he reposted content

64
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:12,380
about mass migration and yes this is not simply a religion issue he was also very antisocial

65
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,780
paranoid and mentally ill it's very easy to radicalize people into anything whether that's

66
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:24,240
far-right terrorism Islamic terrorism in cell-based terrorism antifa based terrorism whatever if the

67
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,400
person in question is isolated or depressed now you think these idiots who have done this

68
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,440
nonsense would have learned their lesson right like this is just a couple weeks ago it was March

69
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,840
23rd or something but yesterday April 2nd there was another attack and the same type of people

70
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,600
did the exact same fucking thing this time the attack was at the US Capitol and the authorities

71
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,800
said that it did not appear to be terror related and look at these idiots fall for it again so he

72
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,800
was white so it was a white Trump supporter without having the slightest clue about the

73
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,400
security incident at the Capitol I'm gonna go ahead and call white nationalist terrorism on

74
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,080
this one someone Rams vehicle into officer and kills him at the US Capitol attacks others with

75
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,740
a knife apparently it's not terrorism related I don't know yet but I'm guessing that means the

76
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,480
suspect was white ah so they were white it's a white person I guess translation it was a white

77
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,320
guy who are all these no-name checkmarks I don't recognize a single one of these idiots and of

78
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:29,040
course it turned out to be a black man and more importantly than that a Nation of Islam follower

79
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,680
you know like the the Louis Farrakhan black supremacist types as soon as that came out to

80
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,920
check out what the journalists were saying multiple senior law enforcement officials

81
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:44,120
briefed on the investigation to say that Noah Greene a 25 year old male from Indiana is the

82
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,040
person who attacked the Capitol today reports say 25 year old Indiana man named Noah Greene

83
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,200
etc etc nobody's mentioning race nobody's mentioning ideology nobody's posting a picture and we know

84
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,600
for a fact this is the kind of stuff that they do if it's say a white in cell or something these

85
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:06,400
people just got bamboozled last week and then it happens again and they do the same fucking thing

86
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,760
again I wonder if you remember this shooting from September 24th 2017 deadly Tennessee Church

87
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:19,080
shooting Sudanese immigrant arrested a man named Emmanuel Cadega Sampson opened fire at a church

88
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,640
in Antioch Tennessee he shot six people killing one and was eventually stopped by a good guy with

89
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:31,040
a gun now the main reason you didn't hear about this shooting is because it happened at the exact

90
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,440
same time as the Las Vegas sniper and fair enough it's not just that the Las Vegas sniper was white

91
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,680
he managed to kill and hurt a lot more people in the fact that it was a sniper it was in a hotel

92
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,440
room there's more of a dramatic angle to the story there's the celebrity aspect because he

93
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,400
was shooting down into into a concert I think it's definitely a story that captures the imagination

94
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,320
more than others but nonetheless there were protests regarding the Las Vegas shootings

95
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,800
saying that it was white supremacist violence and white male rage and all this other nonsense

96
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:06,120
but nobody even said a peep about Tennessee shooting okay maybe it was just overshadowed

97
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,360
due to the sheer amount of dead involved fair enough we all know the George Floyd story right

98
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:17,040
knee on the neck Floyd dies in custody sparks a year of violent antifa riots well back in 2018

99
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,640
another man died in the exact same way that George Floyd did Timothy Kaufman a white person this time

100
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,640
was resisting arrest like Floyd put on the ground like Floyd and then need in the back of the neck

101
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:35,840
like Floyd until he died drugs were a factor in both deaths but in both deaths they still died in

102
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,200
police custody why did only one of these events trigger widespread protests okay okay okay maybe

103
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,920
it's just the fact that the public didn't know back in 2018 and now they know now that the George

104
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:53,640
Floyd thing has happened everyone knows February 22nd 2021 Angelo Quinto dies after the police

105
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:00,360
kneel on his neck for five minutes this is nearly a year after George Floyd did any of you even hear

106
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:07,520
of this story or was it simply buried because the victim was not of the right race now we can have

107
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,680
a different discussion on the responsibility of the police in these scenarios and that is a

108
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,160
legitimate discussion to have that is not the focus that is not the focus of this video but

109
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,040
it will be the focus of a future video the conversation today is about the hypocrisy

110
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:28,640
of selective outrage while it's never good for anybody to die in police custody it is very clear

111
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,480
that only a certain type of person has the privilege of being deified after their death

112
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,640
or having widespread protests happen regarding the injustice of their case or having widespread

113
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:45,600
violence and riots happen in their name and if you look at cases like Rayshard Brooks or Jacob Blake

114
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,440
which are in my opinion a lot more clear-cut on the side of the police you begin to realize

115
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,560
that the common variable is not police brutality at all but rather the race of the victim and you

116
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,240
know what it's not just white people as I've talked about in multiple videos recently black

117
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,080
on Asian crime has ramped up considerably and black on black crime is a far greater killer

118
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,040
than say white on black crime and yet according to the leftist view white people are still to blame

119
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,600
for that black on Asian crimes only occur because of our system of white supremacy that strips

120
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,900
african-americans of their economic opportunities while taking respect and dignity away from Asian

121
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:31,020
Americans yes of course of course so when these black activists walk into this Asian owned nail

122
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:37,180
salon in Milwaukee complete with matching black panther outfits this is Whitey's fault is it are

123
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,540
you so completely reluctant to hold black people responsible for anything that you will blame the

124
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:51,100
actions of black supremacists on white people the way the left treats race is absolute insanity it

125
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,380
seems to me that white privilege is having your death at the hands of the police go completely

126
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:01,900
unnoticed by our society at large thank you for watching my friends if you enjoyed this video
