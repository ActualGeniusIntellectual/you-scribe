00:00.000 --> 00:06.760
Hello, Skullgirls discord, I know that you obsessively watch every video about this drama that comes out

00:06.760 --> 00:11.160
There's always someone who posts it in there. So I know that some of you are gonna be watching this one right now

00:11.160 --> 00:14.960
I hope you guys specifically stick around to the end of this one. I

00:14.960 --> 00:33.640
Remember skullgirls very well it launched back in 2012 over 10 years ago now and I played a fair bit of it on release

00:33.680 --> 00:35.720
But like all things you eventually move on

00:35.720 --> 00:39.660
I haven't touched skullgirls in years and to be honest and I've really intended to go back to it

00:39.660 --> 00:43.740
Even as I heard about the game receiving new updates on the periphery of my attention

00:43.740 --> 00:46.460
It was one of those things where I enjoyed my time with the game

00:46.460 --> 00:50.180
I don't regret the hours I put into it, but I didn't really see a need to go back and play it again

00:50.180 --> 00:56.740
It's been a decade. I'm doing other stuff now as simple as that all of that changed when the skullgirls censorship controversy hit

00:56.740 --> 01:03.900
The first thing I thought of when I heard the news was censorship for skullgirls a game that is specifically about fan service

01:04.220 --> 01:06.520
Okay. Yeah, I know it wasn't all about fan service

01:06.520 --> 01:10.460
But fan service was certainly one of its primary focuses and now they're censoring it

01:10.500 --> 01:16.060
Well to dive into this conversation fully let's rewind back to the beginning part one lab zero games

01:16.360 --> 01:23.620
The primary artist for skullgirls Alex a had or a hot I'm not sure gave an interview about the game during e3 of 2011

01:23.620 --> 01:30.180
He had been doodling rough versions of the main skullgirls characters as far back as the early 2000s while he was still in high school

01:30.260 --> 01:34.340
But the idea of turning them into a fighting game roster emerged while he was attending college

01:34.700 --> 01:40.440
Mike Zimont on the programming side of skullgirls was a few years older during a 2012 panel

01:40.440 --> 01:42.440
He described his own entry into the games industry

01:42.720 --> 01:47.540
His parents bribed him with an Amiga to stop him from trying dangerous stunts on his dirt bike

01:47.680 --> 01:52.720
This got him interested in computers and eventually led to him taking up a tester job the lowest of the possible

01:52.900 --> 01:55.280
Entry points into game development, but it paid off

01:55.320 --> 01:59.400
He worked on Star Wars Battlefront 2 as a programmer the original one

01:59.400 --> 02:03.600
Not that god-awful modern version as well as assisting with Lord of the Rings conquest

02:03.680 --> 02:08.080
He was also a professional fighting game player and evo champion and these two

02:08.400 --> 02:15.280
Intersecting skill sets allowed him to land gigs balancing blaze blue continuum shift and Marvel vs. Capcom 2 by

02:15.680 --> 02:22.440
2009 Zimont was programming his own fighting engine on the side and a mutual friend introduced some day had the two quickly realized that they

02:22.440 --> 02:27.780
Had artwork and character roster fit well with the engine that Zimont was creating and they decided to work together to make a fighting game

02:27.780 --> 02:35.160
They were both fans of Western and Eastern art giving skullgirls its unique half anime half rubber hose animation feel

02:35.200 --> 02:40.800
They also wanted to make a Western take on the Japanese all-girl fan service fighter a la arcana heart

02:40.800 --> 02:43.080
But they also realized they couldn't do it with just the two of them

02:43.080 --> 02:48.840
Hey had and Zimont shot the idea around to multiple indie developers eventually signing with Reverge labs in 2010

02:49.040 --> 02:54.220
Reverge labs signed a deal with autumn games to publish skullgirls with Konami handling distribution

02:54.640 --> 03:00.240
Skullgirls launched a critical and commercial success in April of 2012. However autumn games had other problems

03:00.760 --> 03:05.560
Allegations of fraud were levied at both autumn games and Konami by City National Bank

03:05.600 --> 03:12.560
The two companies secured a 14 million dollar line of credit from the bank to publish and distribute the 2010 game Def Jam

03:12.840 --> 03:19.480
Rapstar and the bank was alleging that the two companies misrepresented their financial status at the time of their deal as a result autumn games went

03:19.480 --> 03:20.640
into belt tightening mode

03:20.640 --> 03:24.440
They couldn't afford to renew the contract with Reverge labs and after time was up

03:24.480 --> 03:29.880
Reverge labs ran out of funding all of their employees were subsequently laid off including the Zimont and a had

03:30.360 --> 03:37.400
Wasn't the end for skullgirls though the Reverge labs employees who had worked on skullgirls formed a new company lab zero games with Zimont

03:37.400 --> 03:43.760
As the new owner autumn games retained the skullgirls IP and hired lab zero games to continue work on skullgirls updates

03:43.760 --> 03:45.280
But still funding was tight

03:45.280 --> 03:51.760
So the team turned to indiegogo now remember this was in February of 2013 while there's still a lot of crowdfunding scams nowadays

03:51.760 --> 03:55.800
People have more or less acclimated to the crowdfunding model back then though

03:55.800 --> 04:00.440
There was a lot more skepticism among the average internet user regarding the validity of crowdfunding a game

04:00.600 --> 04:03.920
but the skullgirls crew managed to pull it off raking in a total of

04:05.280 --> 04:10.960
$830,000 covering the funding for four additional characters and a whole bunch of other goodies including an art book a

04:11.040 --> 04:17.380
soundtrack release and a bunch of alternate voice packs and other small bonuses by November of 2013 autumn games

04:17.480 --> 04:23.740
Severed ties with Konami claiming that Konami's lack of response was a major hurdle in the distribution of new content for the game

04:23.940 --> 04:31.100
Konami replied by demanding that the Konami published versions of skullgirls on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 storefronts be pulled

04:31.340 --> 04:38.500
lab zero games announced that the game would be re-released as skullgirls encore by spring of 2014 with all the current

04:38.720 --> 04:46.580
DLC included as baseline and without any Konami involvement the Xbox 360 and steam versions of skullgirls were updated to the skullgirls

04:46.780 --> 04:52.740
Encore version but due to technical limitations the ps3 version was pulled from the store and had to be redown loaded as a new game

04:52.900 --> 04:57.380
Sony made the game freely available on ps3 to all previous owners of skullgirls

04:57.380 --> 05:00.320
But unfortunately gamers save data didn't carry over to the new version

05:00.420 --> 05:07.100
The game was eventually updated again this time with a skullgirls second encore branding with a new round of characters and updates

05:07.520 --> 05:14.820
Second encore was the baseline version of skullgirls for the ps4 which was released in July of 2015 by April of 2016

05:14.820 --> 05:18.040
The steam version of skullgirls was updated to second encore as well

05:18.360 --> 05:24.480
Meanwhile autumn games had tapped a phone developer hidden variable studios to create the game skullgirls mobile

05:24.480 --> 05:26.800
This wasn't just a phone version of the main skullgirls game

05:26.800 --> 05:33.120
This was a new title set as a prequel to the main story and made only for phones skullgirls mobile released in May of 2017

05:33.720 --> 05:40.000
After a long silence skullgirls a second encore received a Nintendo switch port in October of 2019 the Wii U

05:40.120 --> 05:43.800
Nintendo 3ds and Xbox one were all considered for skullgirls ports

05:43.800 --> 05:48.440
But were ultimately skipped at this point in the story skullgirls is a pretty old game and yet

05:48.540 --> 05:52.520
Updating it and refining it is what lab zero games had to focus the majority of its efforts on

05:52.960 --> 05:54.840
Skullgirls just didn't receive enough

05:54.840 --> 06:01.000
Consistent support or continued cash flow to be a game with a life cycle this long and it wasn't just because of Konami's roadblocks

06:01.120 --> 06:06.280
Autumn games was also out of money and couldn't afford to keep funding lab zero games for continued development

06:06.680 --> 06:13.540
Skullgirls development only started to make a comeback after autumn games pushed the mobile game out and by then lab zero games

06:13.660 --> 06:16.020
Was already deep into production on their next title

06:16.340 --> 06:21.940
Indivisible a hat and zymont had shifted their focus to early indivisible development as far back as 2015

06:21.940 --> 06:27.980
But according to a lab zero games employee on Twitter a had left the company in the middle of indivisible development because he had become

06:28.100 --> 06:31.980
Increasingly hostile difficult to work with and was not able to meet company standards

06:31.980 --> 06:35.380
He later tried to sue the company and walked away with a sizable settlement

06:35.500 --> 06:39.100
So with a head of the pitcher zymont was the remaining member of the original

06:39.380 --> 06:45.900
Skullgirls duo and he seemed to want to move on to indivisible development while autumn games was trying to keep the skullgirls raft afloat

06:45.900 --> 06:46.820
Yeah, I know guys

06:46.820 --> 06:48.860
It was a popular game in 2012

06:48.860 --> 06:53.900
But we're at 2020 at this point focusing on new projects is the right choice for the company going forward

06:53.900 --> 06:57.440
The truth is by 2020 nobody's talking about skullgirls anymore

06:57.440 --> 07:02.240
But people would start talking about skullgirls again very soon though not for the reasons

07:02.240 --> 07:07.480
Anybody wanted part two the downfall of Mike Z in June of 2020

07:07.480 --> 07:12.580
Mike zymont was commentating an official skullgirls tournament when he made an I can't breathe joke

07:12.720 --> 07:17.120
This was two weeks after George Floyd's death. Just just listen to this

07:19.440 --> 07:21.440
She's gonna die, yeah

07:27.480 --> 07:29.480
Would it be fair to say that uh

07:30.320 --> 07:32.320
You can't breathe

07:46.120 --> 07:47.960
All right gelato

07:47.960 --> 07:49.880
You got a chance now

07:49.880 --> 07:53.800
Yeah, that might be one of the most awkward things I've ever heard captured on audio

07:54.240 --> 07:57.200
Zymont apologized in the same day saying that the joke was too soon

07:57.200 --> 08:01.960
He blamed his social awkwardness for not being able to read the room, but the damage was done

08:01.960 --> 08:04.640
He was canceled and we all know how canceling events work

08:04.640 --> 08:09.440
so of course this would be the precise moment that other people jump out of the woodwork to accuse Zymont of of

08:09.720 --> 08:15.800
Whatever really professional twitch streamer and cosplayer bunny a you known for thirst trapping everywhere

08:15.800 --> 08:19.680
She goes in the internet leaked her DMS with Zymont where she thanked him for including

08:19.920 --> 08:24.560
Lesbian BDSM in skullgirls and claims his response to her was creepy bunny

08:24.560 --> 08:32.440
I you has her own deep lore most notably being in a high-profile relationship with another thirst trapper that ended very publicly and

08:33.040 --> 08:37.920
Spectacularly with her being slapped with her own set of allegations. That's a different rabbit hole for another day

08:37.920 --> 08:41.560
What's important right now is that at least in my view bunny I you is a snake

08:41.560 --> 08:47.040
She masks her behavior behind a progressive inclusive public persona, which is why I'm not surprised

08:47.040 --> 08:51.080
She was the one to jump on the Mike Z canceled bandwagon first just to be clear

08:51.080 --> 08:58.000
She publicly thanked a had for including lesbian BDSM in the game who responded with the ever so slightly flirtatious glad you liked it

08:58.000 --> 09:00.360
Oh, ho ho. This is like a 0.1 on the first scale

09:00.400 --> 09:08.280
But she had privately messaged Zymont with the sentiment and characterized his responses as uncomfortable and demeaning. Let's go over their DMS

09:08.440 --> 09:14.160
Thank you for making a video game. Where is there is BDSM Yuri. I'm glad you enjoy it

09:14.240 --> 09:16.240
Yeah question mark seems appropriate

09:16.240 --> 09:21.120
There's a lot less of that type of thing than it was originally because even fewer people would have taken it seriously

09:21.120 --> 09:28.160
Otherwise witness filly is unused typo pose, which you can look up online. That's not good middle enough. Let's see who this person is

09:28.160 --> 09:33.760
Oh, I think it's the lady was streaming the game recently. They mistook button Jupiter for visits the Twitter page

09:33.760 --> 09:40.320
Whoa, you actually have a catch light slash. I like that's some serious production values. I have so many questions

09:40.320 --> 09:44.240
I want to ask that. I'm definitely not going to ask. I'm happy SG is fun for you

09:44.240 --> 09:50.040
I joked about sending the thanks for Yuri fan service message on twitch while playing Eliza story

09:50.040 --> 09:57.640
I also tweeted to an artist who was completely respectful and normal about it. Here's the link this one. I think it's awesome

09:57.640 --> 10:04.280
I understand though. I like DOA a lot, but it gets a lot of negative feedback for being too sexy

10:04.280 --> 10:09.360
I love Philly yellow. Yep. I have played skull goes three times on stream

10:09.360 --> 10:15.440
I really love the style and played Eliza's story today. So that's why I thank you for the your a BDSM

10:15.800 --> 10:21.120
Ask away. I'm a fan of the game so far. It's like really cool and fun for sure

10:21.120 --> 10:22.400
Oh, yes

10:22.400 --> 10:27.240
We had to add all the mommy raps to Eliza's getting throne frames and we wouldn't have gotten the right rating

10:27.240 --> 10:33.160
Also some foam in her bath strangely said nothing about her other storyboat art ask the questions. Well

10:34.000 --> 10:35.680
Okay

10:35.680 --> 10:39.720
Are you putting on the high voice like lots of Japanese ladies do what brought you SG?

10:39.720 --> 10:45.680
Anyway, I guess I've embraced the thirst culture. But like isn't this weird. It's definitely not anyone's fancy

10:45.680 --> 10:49.120
I don't know how I feel at your place. Did you start out with that as a name?

10:49.120 --> 10:55.920
I'm genuinely curious. My voice is real. It gets higher pitch when I'm excited though. I'm cursed with it

10:55.920 --> 10:58.840
I get that question a lot. I like fighting games

10:58.840 --> 11:03.680
I've had an interest since I was a kid and I wanted to revisit some for nostalgia

11:03.680 --> 11:09.880
I found skull girls through recommendations from my fans. It doesn't bother me thirst is human nature

11:09.880 --> 11:16.760
I started as a grab your style model online and did sexy modeling for maybe three years or so before retiring

11:16.800 --> 11:20.160
I retired a year ago to pursue twitch streaming

11:20.160 --> 11:27.320
I'm used to thirst stuff from my job and I'm a huge fan of each artist and the culture so it doesn't really bother me

11:27.480 --> 11:31.800
Well, sorry for ask the dumb comic questions, I know some other ladies like that

11:31.800 --> 11:34.280
I bet it's annoying to get asked to put your parent on the phone

11:34.280 --> 11:41.880
I suppose there's definitely helps sub count and probably validation if external validation is necessary. I'm embarrassed enough streaming at all and I dislike

11:42.680 --> 11:49.120
People so I feel like quantified speaking here. Hey, I'm sort of curious what your family thinks of it

11:49.120 --> 11:53.560
But that's a dangerously close to the coin. What is your boyfriend think promo of you single?

11:53.560 --> 11:58.480
It's just the world up so unfamiliar with gravia the printing process Oh

11:59.160 --> 12:05.640
Google helped you're aware of like the prevalent problems with sexism in the FGC assume. Sorry about that advance

12:05.640 --> 12:09.920
I love the skull girls community in particular is better about it. Anyway, I don't mean to bother you

12:09.920 --> 12:13.560
You're just kind of fascinating and unfamiliar. Well, that's a good weird ending

12:13.560 --> 12:20.840
The validation comment was like very uncomfortable and demeaning. Can you imagine this conversation with a man in the FCG?

12:21.640 --> 12:26.240
Hmm I'm sure you get messages from humans with penises asking that kind of stuff pretty regularly

12:26.280 --> 12:29.800
So if you prefer, how about I acknowledge the brain inside the lady?

12:29.840 --> 12:33.200
It takes a lot of skill and kind of get a certain amount of both

12:33.480 --> 12:40.680
Integrity and ruthlessness to succeed at pretty much anything. So calculating successful person who owns herself. What's your end goal is streaming sustainable

12:40.680 --> 12:46.120
Do you want to own a tech company or manufacture solar cells or grow cute flowers or what?

12:46.120 --> 12:50.380
I'd like to know what to prepare to invest in his responses are creepy

12:50.760 --> 12:55.800
Demeaning and I really don't think you would talk to a man this way in the initial messages

12:55.800 --> 13:02.260
I want comes off as an awkward starstruck nerd bunny replies by blowing up his ego a bit over how much she liked skull girls

13:02.800 --> 13:06.360
Considering that bunny started this conversation with sexual content, you know

13:06.360 --> 13:09.880
The lesbian BDSM thing it makes sense that the conversation might go this way

13:10.040 --> 13:16.280
One of the questions I'm on asks her is what it's like to embrace thirst culture and be the object of people's affections

13:16.400 --> 13:22.000
Bunny replies honestly saying that this is human nature. She's been a model for years. She's used to thirst stuff from her job

13:22.000 --> 13:24.160
She's a big fan of hentai in the surrounding culture

13:24.160 --> 13:30.320
So this type of conversation doesn't bother her after this as I months questions do become more creepy and more personal

13:30.320 --> 13:34.560
But they also kind of read like an awkward nervous nerd who thinks he's having a sexual

13:34.880 --> 13:40.720
Conversation with a girl way out of his league and you know considering how bunny started the conversation with sex

13:40.800 --> 13:46.960
That is one of the possible directions a reasonable person could believe this is gonna go at this point bunny cuts contact with him

13:46.960 --> 13:49.000
And then blasts him online as a creep

13:49.000 --> 13:51.200
But frankly I can see it from both points of view

13:51.520 --> 13:56.720
Bunny seems like somebody who's had to deal with creeps a lot sexual content is likely pretty normalized to her

13:56.720 --> 13:59.480
So to her this was an innocent conversation not a sexual one

13:59.680 --> 14:06.640
Meanwhile as I'm on seems like an otaku who gets exactly zero play and suddenly this hot chick is sliding into his DMS talking about

14:06.640 --> 14:09.280
How grateful she is for his lesbian bondage content?

14:09.280 --> 14:12.320
I can absolutely see a guy like that spilling his spaghetti

14:12.400 --> 14:18.680
But of course bunny only saw fit to release this during Zaymon being canceled over the George Floyd joke

14:18.680 --> 14:22.120
She dropped the logs along with the following public statement

14:22.120 --> 14:27.240
I will no longer be playing skull girls the creator Mike with incredibly

14:27.840 --> 14:30.160
Disrespectful in DMS and made me very uncomfortable

14:30.520 --> 14:36.360
I have shared screenshots of the conversation to others in the FCG and to combo Queens

14:37.040 --> 14:40.980
Combo Queens is a group that tries to get women into the fighting game community

14:41.360 --> 14:48.800
affiliated with combo breaker a professional fighting game event that Mike Z used to commentate for as a result of bunny going public with the

14:48.800 --> 14:55.280
DMS Richard Thire the general manager of Evo and the event director with combo breaker put out this statement in

14:55.480 --> 15:01.080
In addition to the listed reprimands are relayed in the statement released by multiple skullgirls organizers and community members

15:01.080 --> 15:06.240
Mike Z will not be welcome at CB 2021 in addition to well

15:06.240 --> 15:10.960
Uh this account called da purple sharpie who seems to be just a random

15:11.200 --> 15:18.580
Individual speaking for the skullgirls community presented a list of demands that the fans want implemented upon Mike Zaymon in

15:18.720 --> 15:22.560
Retaliation for the whole bunny thing. Yeah, I don't know what the fuck this is all about

15:22.800 --> 15:27.360
These people aren't employees of anything they're not from an organization. They're just fans

15:27.840 --> 15:28.920
Alright, let's read it

15:28.920 --> 15:35.800
Our goal is to create a gaming space that is welcome for all participants regardless of their race gender blah blah blah

15:35.800 --> 15:43.600
We believe Mike Zaymon should no longer be welcome on commentary or participating in events in the skullgirls community as there is no singular

15:43.600 --> 15:50.600
Entity responsible for the skullgirls community for who determines who is allowed on commentary or who determines per event eligibility

15:50.600 --> 15:54.920
We are asking the community to respect and uphold the following actions one

15:55.520 --> 16:00.760
indefinite ban from all commentary to a two-year ban from offline and online

16:01.300 --> 16:03.300
competition until July 30th

16:03.320 --> 16:11.080
2022 our decision to enact and recommend these reprimands was based on Mike's history of problematic behavior in public and

16:11.280 --> 16:17.240
Private including the callous. I can't breathe reference while commentating a match and the reveal of additional inappropriate

16:17.800 --> 16:23.120
Interactions with members of the skullgirls community in private we believe these okay, okay, who's who signed this?

16:23.120 --> 16:28.240
There's a couple of tournament organizers couple of pro fighters and the skullgirls discord administrators

16:28.960 --> 16:36.560
The discord admins guys the jannies do it for free after this a second cosplayer named carbon gray who has annoyingly changed

16:36.560 --> 16:43.640
Her name to also be bunny since this drop back in 2020 came out with a video making it vague but similar allegations against Zaymon

16:43.800 --> 16:49.800
This is like my 20 billionth take I have not yet read bunnies DMS, I don't know what Mike said to her

16:49.800 --> 16:54.900
I'm sure it was shitty and I know that because Mike's been making weird sexual comments at me in and out of cosplay

16:55.240 --> 17:00.860
Fighting game events for actual years and I've been writing a lot of it off because when I tell people they're just like oh

17:01.400 --> 17:04.540
He's kind of like that. I'm sorry and like yeah

17:04.540 --> 17:10.160
He is kind of like that and he's kind of not changing for the past five years y'all and like neither is anyone else in

17:10.160 --> 17:15.720
The fighting game community and I think a lot of it is because when I tell like my male friends or other TOS what's happening

17:15.720 --> 17:17.840
They just kind of don't do anything with that information

17:18.200 --> 17:24.200
If you find out that one of your friends is being absolutely weird or creepy to females in the community

17:24.200 --> 17:26.720
You need to call them on it and actually hold them accountable

17:26.920 --> 17:30.340
This is par for the course when someone's canceled it happened with super mega as well

17:30.340 --> 17:37.360
There's generally one person with detailed allegations logs or text or whatever and then a few hanger-ons show up later to literally go me

17:37.360 --> 17:40.080
To me too and most of the time they have far less evidence

17:40.280 --> 17:46.760
She expanded on her allegations in a series of tweets that basically amounted to Mike said weird sexual shit to me

17:46.760 --> 17:52.620
IRL and we're supposed to just take her at her word for the most part what carbon is describing is actually pretty bad if it

17:52.620 --> 17:52.960
happened

17:52.960 --> 17:59.040
This is all he said she said stuff that she's clearly been holding on to and only dropping right now because Mike's going viral

17:59.200 --> 18:03.160
For most of these examples, there's nobody to corroborate carbon story

18:03.160 --> 18:07.160
But in one there actually was another witness who told their version of events

18:07.540 --> 18:15.660
Mr. Banana god 7 who said on June 29th 2020 during the bunny a you think that Mike tried to laugh it off and apologized

18:15.840 --> 18:17.980
Carbon agreed at least enough to like the tweets

18:18.280 --> 18:22.360
However, when carbon retells this story two months later in August of 2020

18:22.360 --> 18:29.520
She says he could have just apologized two separate people have told me they asked him to apologize to me the apology that banana god 7

18:29.600 --> 18:35.040
Confirmed Mike gave and that carbon agreed with has been completely erased from the narrative now

18:35.040 --> 18:39.360
Maybe you could say that Mike's apology being of the laughing off of variety was not good enough

18:39.360 --> 18:40.680
It wasn't serious or something

18:40.680 --> 18:47.220
Maybe that's the case but carbon saying he apologized and I didn't accept it sounds way worse than he didn't apologize

18:47.220 --> 18:54.040
Which is in my opinion why the story quietly morphed over time another allegation came from a guy named. Mr

18:54.040 --> 19:00.360
Beezle a former employee at lab zero games. I had to dig this shit up on the wayback machine because he's since nuked all

19:00.360 --> 19:01.340
of his allegations

19:01.340 --> 19:07.200
Mr. Beezle claims that Mike Z scapegoated him gaslit him made verbal threats of violence against him

19:07.200 --> 19:12.540
But he saves the worst for last he made a racist remark three times the majority of mr

19:12.540 --> 19:19.560
Beezle's thread is focused on the racism and we never actually get any explanation on the threats. They're just forgotten about mr

19:19.560 --> 19:27.020
Beezle complained about getting racially profiled as a Latino thug despite describing himself as the stereotypical image of a Latino thug and he called

19:27.020 --> 19:32.440
Mike a white man in power who refused to see my reality. This is a really strange allegation, man

19:32.480 --> 19:37.600
Mike looks more like a Middle Easterner than a white guy and zymont is a Jewish last name. Oh, he's a colonizer

19:37.600 --> 19:42.520
I get it now in actuality. This is another he said she said story and even in mr

19:42.520 --> 19:45.080
Beezle's retelling of events Mike doesn't sound like a harasser

19:45.080 --> 19:49.820
He sounds like an idiot who is entirely clueless about the intricacies of politics and systemic racism

19:49.820 --> 19:52.000
And the only thing I can really say to that is boy

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
I wish that were me all of these other people coming forward with their own Mike Z story

19:57.160 --> 20:00.160
Prompted bunny to publicly declare that she felt like she was doing the right thing

20:00.160 --> 20:06.280
I was extremely anxious even mentioning anything because it could have been way worse

20:06.360 --> 20:11.080
But hearing all the women come forward after my post and bms makes it worth it

20:11.080 --> 20:17.040
We need to make the fcg better for women. I am taking the rest of the day to process everything

20:17.600 --> 20:18.640
Thank you

20:18.640 --> 20:24.840
It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows for her though enough people saw through her bullshit that she began to take flack for this obvious

20:24.840 --> 20:29.880
Spin job so much so that she eventually backed down Mike has reached out to me with an apology

20:29.880 --> 20:34.120
I really hope this makes him aware of others who have come out in hindsight

20:34.120 --> 20:40.680
I feel like I should have handled this differently and I apologize for that. I will be deleting my tweets moving forward

20:41.080 --> 20:44.400
It was too little too late for Mike's I'm on though in the eyes of the public

20:44.400 --> 20:45.760
He went from being an awkward

20:45.760 --> 20:52.460
Flirter to a sex pest to a sexual harasser to a sexual assaulter pretty quick as a result of all of this the board of directors

20:52.460 --> 20:56.440
At lab zero games formally requested that he resigned from his position

20:56.440 --> 21:00.080
However, you have to remember that Simon wasn't just the lead developer at lab zero games

21:00.080 --> 21:03.440
He was also the owner of the company in exchange for his resignation

21:03.800 --> 21:07.680
Simon made demands of the board that one member Brian June described as

21:08.120 --> 21:12.800
Unrealistically high and potentially illegal the board rejected the demands and in response

21:13.000 --> 21:16.520
Simon simply executed his power as owner of the company and dissolved the board

21:16.600 --> 21:21.760
He gave all employees an ultimatum if you got a problem with it leave the company by August 31st

21:22.000 --> 21:28.040
2020 and so they did a bunch of people left lab zero games publishing statements on social media denouncing

21:28.240 --> 21:35.080
Simon shortly after all of us autumn games and the skullgirls mobile developer hidden variable studios announced they were severing ties with

21:35.240 --> 21:36.520
Simon and lab zero games

21:36.520 --> 21:42.840
They also announced that since autumn games still owns the skullgirls IP they intended to simply continue work on

21:43.000 --> 21:49.800
Skullgirls with the employees that had left lab zero games and without Simon the employees made a new studio called future club and began working

21:49.800 --> 21:53.440
With autumn games to create additional content for skullgirls second encore

21:53.720 --> 22:00.120
Simon dissolved lab zero games shortly afterward which put an early end to updates for indivisible which had just been released

22:00.160 --> 22:03.400
The Simon continued to be active in professional fighting game scene

22:03.400 --> 22:05.920
But he exited the game development industry for a couple of years

22:06.080 --> 22:12.960
He resurfaced in the summer of 2023 as an employee of modus games working on diesel legacy the brazen age

22:13.120 --> 22:15.960
It's a hand-drawn 2d fighting game like skullgirls

22:15.960 --> 22:23.100
But the animations a completely different style from a heads work the CEO of modus games Christina seal stated directly that she chose to hire

22:23.120 --> 22:27.180
Simon for the game not solely because of his extensive experience in the industry

22:27.180 --> 22:31.440
But because she believes that he's accepted his guilt and is capable of being reformed

22:31.480 --> 22:36.120
I am one of the few women that are CEO's and making games in its entire

22:36.520 --> 22:39.760
Industry in a couple years since I made that decision to hire Mike

22:39.760 --> 22:47.680
I'm one of the two women CEO's that are running publicly listed companies in the whole industry in the world

22:47.680 --> 22:54.240
I did not take this decision lightly when I was talking to Mike and went through the process of figuring out where he was

22:54.240 --> 23:01.120
At if you want to have an inclusive environment in the world and you want to have diverse viewpoints all of the things we want

23:01.720 --> 23:03.040
diversity equity

23:03.040 --> 23:09.300
Inclusion you have to have a path for people to learn and improve you have to create a better

23:09.400 --> 23:14.440
Way for them to show the world that they've changed and decided to do better

23:14.440 --> 23:18.840
and I really got that from Mike I got that he was committed to it and

23:19.240 --> 23:23.400
That he didn't want everything that went down to be the end of his story

23:23.400 --> 23:29.800
He wanted the opportunity to have the redemptive arc that's in so many stories that we all love man

23:29.800 --> 23:32.480
Maybe I've just become too cynical reading communist theory

23:32.480 --> 23:37.240
But this really sounds like Ximont's gone through a struggle session and has come out of it re-educated and de-fanged

23:37.240 --> 23:41.640
You know what? I mean? He made an edgy joke at the wrong time in a just society

23:41.640 --> 23:45.160
That's something that you apologize for and move on from but that's not what happened

23:45.240 --> 23:51.660
one George Floyd joke turned into internet outrage which turned into sexual assault allegations because he was a nerd who thought a hot girl was

23:51.660 --> 23:55.960
Flirting with him and his DMS were clipped and shipped at the perfect moment during the cancelling

23:56.000 --> 23:59.160
He's not innocent but he's also not guilty of the high crimes

23:59.160 --> 24:03.240
Everyone thinks that he is and seal here coming out and saying oh, he's reformed now

24:03.240 --> 24:10.960
I've got him on my leash just seems very strange part 3 the censorship with both Ximont and a hat out of the picture and

24:10.960 --> 24:13.600
Now considered to be problematic elements by the community

24:13.600 --> 24:17.980
It was time for the past of skull girls to be scrubbed clean of any impure elements

24:17.980 --> 24:25.480
You know despite being a fan service focus game in June of 2023 skull girls second encore was updated to remove any risque elements

24:25.520 --> 24:33.480
This includes removing all panty shots or otherwise sexual shots of the various female characters like torn clothing the BDSM inspired stuff

24:33.480 --> 24:35.480
That bunny I you complimented is gone, too

24:35.600 --> 24:40.660
Removing the Nazi inspired red armbands of the red egrets one of the game's villainous factions

24:40.960 --> 24:47.240
Removing artwork from the game's art book that references either the game's sexuality or the red egrets armbands keep in mind

24:47.240 --> 24:50.360
This is a digital art book for the Indiegogo backer version of the game

24:50.360 --> 24:54.180
If you crowdfunded this game back in the day your art book has been changed

24:54.500 --> 25:00.540
Removing the hair comb in Philia's afro animation presumably because it's some sort of black afro stereotype or something

25:00.740 --> 25:03.980
Removing the police brutality scene in big bands story mode

25:04.260 --> 25:10.340
Removing sexual jokes like barely legal for reaching an 18 hit combo or peacocks opening reference to hentai

25:14.380 --> 25:18.540
Removing the Soviet announcer voice pack. I don't think this is because it made fun of communism

25:18.540 --> 25:21.860
It's way more likely that it's because Mike Ximont voiced it

25:21.900 --> 25:25.900
Oh and just in case you thought you could download old versions of the game to get around this

25:26.060 --> 25:26.580
Yeah

25:26.580 --> 25:28.100
Those don't exist anymore on

25:28.100 --> 25:35.940
Steam and modern consoles second encore over wrote the originals years ago remember and on older consoles where the original skull girls is still

25:35.940 --> 25:39.340
The latest version Konami made them impossible to download years ago

25:39.340 --> 25:42.860
But if you had them downloaded you could still play them until recently

25:42.900 --> 25:46.780
They were quietly finally disabled off your system in this update

25:46.780 --> 25:50.580
I even logged into my old Xbox 360 to see for myself and nope

25:50.580 --> 25:57.220
Even though the game has been paid for it's gone on my Xbox series X skull girl second encore is available to purchase

25:57.220 --> 26:01.340
No problem. However, I still have the original skull girls registered to the account

26:01.340 --> 26:03.580
And if I go to that page in my game library

26:03.580 --> 26:09.060
It simply says not available right now or ever again Microsoft as expected

26:09.060 --> 26:11.060
There was a huge fan backlash

26:11.220 --> 26:16.860
Fan service is a core part of skull girls as identity and removing it basically rips out what made skull girls fun

26:16.940 --> 26:19.940
Plus a lot of the stuff that was removed were indie go-go goals

26:19.940 --> 26:22.700
Like if they reached X amount of dollars in crowdfunding

26:22.700 --> 26:24.100
They would add a perk to the game

26:24.100 --> 26:29.780
People had met those goals with their own money and now a decade later the content they funded was being axed for political correctness

26:30.140 --> 26:32.900
Fans responded by leaving negative reviews on Steam

26:33.060 --> 26:37.300
Causing the 10 year old game to dip into the mostly negative rating for the first time in its history

26:37.340 --> 26:43.500
Of course the new developers at Future Club sensor the negative reviews and the score has mostly recovered by now and to be fair

26:43.500 --> 26:48.260
There were a lot of people who didn't actually play skull girls leaving negative reviews as well

26:48.260 --> 26:50.260
And these guys are clearly jumping on a bandwagon

26:50.700 --> 26:55.580
However, the general consensus among the public is that while censoring a fan service game is kind of lame

26:55.900 --> 27:02.340
Specifically censoring the art book to remove guest art and concept art that is no longer in line with the current vision of the game

27:02.340 --> 27:05.520
Is what reveals this whole thing to have an ideological motive?

27:05.800 --> 27:11.880
Anybody who's seen an art book for a game before knows that oftentimes the art in the book doesn't make it into the final game

27:11.880 --> 27:18.480
It's meant to show off a work in progress to show how the game evolved from the earliest spitballing of ideas to the current release

27:19.040 --> 27:22.840
Censoring the art book is quite literally removing the past and pretending it never happened

27:23.120 --> 27:29.960
Another tiny tidbit that shows their intent is how after all the censorship went through they began calling their current round of updates

27:30.080 --> 27:33.560
Season one like everything done before this moment just didn't happen

27:33.560 --> 27:40.920
It's a very creepy year zero type of stuff and then the legendary discord DMS leaked only adding fuel to the fire

27:41.000 --> 27:46.700
Let's read them at rocks chobatsu a lot of the original team went on to do their own thing like richer

27:46.920 --> 27:51.760
Alex a had left but not before making a big stink about it. Mike's I'm aunt needs no explanation

27:51.760 --> 27:58.480
I'm sure but Mariel Earl Brady Brian Chris. They're all still here Miyazaki the red shinobi. Yeah

27:58.480 --> 28:02.800
It's still a majority of the OGs and I knew you guys are never comfortable with certain stuff in the game

28:03.240 --> 28:06.280
Aatrox lol. I mean I liken it to just housekeeping

28:06.760 --> 28:08.960
Miyazaki and to see so many people say no

28:08.960 --> 28:11.520
This is what drew me in specifically just makes me pity them so much

28:11.960 --> 28:14.800
Aatrox like there's a dirty sock in the corner

28:14.800 --> 28:18.660
That's just been there for years and we only just had time to get it out of the way now

28:19.280 --> 28:24.360
2011 was such a different time too. Oh boy a current year reference. Here's the context Miyazaki

28:24.360 --> 28:30.160
The red shinobi is the person who took this screenshot and released it to the public since the discord DM window is labeled as sending

28:30.160 --> 28:33.720
Messages to a trucks unless somebody stole Miyazaki's phone and released it or something

28:33.720 --> 28:38.300
We can assume it was him who sent it a quick check online shows that Miyazaki has been a longtime

28:38.600 --> 28:45.640
Skullgirls fan having been part of the skullgirls fan website skull heart calm ever since the game launched and posting on the skullgirls

28:45.640 --> 28:52.640
Discord as far back as 2015 his pics of account also has a bunch of skullgirls lewd fan art favorited either

28:52.760 --> 28:59.120
He genuinely agrees with the current skullgirl censorship as he originally wrote in the DM making him kind of hypocritical or he struck up

28:59.120 --> 29:03.440
This conversation with one of the developers with the express purpose of making them put their foot in their mouths

29:03.440 --> 29:09.160
I tend to believe it's the latter because this conversation does not make the developers look good and he chose to release it plus

29:09.160 --> 29:13.840
I'm currently in the skullgirls discord myself and checking out his profile on old messages

29:13.840 --> 29:18.300
It seems like he's been kicked from the server. It sounds like he was our guy getting us some info

29:18.400 --> 29:22.360
Also, just real quick during my perusal of the skullgirls discord public channels

29:22.400 --> 29:29.000
It seems like they purged not only trolls and shit stirrers, but genuine fans who expressed discontentment at the changes

29:29.440 --> 29:33.480
Atrox Chobatsu is one of the current artists working for Future Club on skullgirls

29:33.480 --> 29:38.460
And as far as I can tell he was not a part of the original team back during the Reverge lab days

29:38.680 --> 29:41.820
He's very lefty hailing from Portland. We all know what that place already

29:41.920 --> 29:46.760
He's also the guy who hosts the skullgirls animation streams on Twitch. I watched a bit of them

29:46.760 --> 29:49.600
There's nothing really going on there. In fact, he generally doesn't talk

29:49.640 --> 29:53.200
He actually just types in the chat in between drawing or whatever

29:53.240 --> 29:57.720
He hasn't publicly said anything directly with the controversy but two days after it broke

29:57.720 --> 29:59.080
He posted this on Twitter

29:59.080 --> 30:04.880
Is it considered censorship if I wanted to remove my tattoo of Yuji Naka's face from my left armpit?

30:04.880 --> 30:09.720
I don't know. I'm just not feeling the same reverence I had for the man 20 years ago. It was a different time

30:09.720 --> 30:12.520
I was younger and stupider, but not by much in my opinion

30:12.520 --> 30:15.920
This is a tongue-in-cheek jab at people who were crying censorship over skullgirls

30:15.960 --> 30:21.900
His positions clear the current legal owners of the skullgirls property who are not the original duo who conceived of it anymore

30:21.920 --> 30:25.240
Don't like some parts of the game and they want to update it which yes

30:25.240 --> 30:31.160
They have the legal right to do but that also means pissing off everyone who doesn't agree with their new vision and those people

30:31.160 --> 30:34.400
They're not likely to keep supporting you the DMS show that at least

30:34.400 --> 30:40.440
Atrox believes rewriting the past and updating it to fit modern progressive sensibilities is a good thing as he seems like the type to

30:40.440 --> 30:42.440
Develop some variant of trolls remorse

30:42.560 --> 30:46.000
He used to make kind of edgy stuff back on Newgrounds and in one of his old

30:46.160 --> 30:52.280
Animations from 2012 it cuts away to some real-life pictures of somebody that I assumed to be him since he does talk about himself as being

30:52.280 --> 30:53.480
the artist of the animation

30:53.480 --> 30:59.440
He looks like a pretty normal internet nerd from that era and most Millennials cut from this cloth suffer from trolls remorse today

30:59.440 --> 31:02.560
For example, despite his current very progressive sensibilities

31:02.560 --> 31:08.520
His personal YouTube channel has a video from 2009 where he's goofing around with his friends and one of them says faggot

31:12.440 --> 31:14.440
You're not the father

31:29.000 --> 31:32.400
The worst words are ones that are not spoken, okay

31:33.920 --> 31:39.580
I'm not pointing this out to cancel him even though an edgy joke is literally what got the cancel ball rolling on Mike Simon

31:39.580 --> 31:45.060
I'm only pointing out that just like the tattoo allegory implies. This is clearly not something that he'd do nowadays

31:45.060 --> 31:50.960
Oh, also, he's out here talking about how problematic skullgirls is while drawing lewd furry artwork

31:50.960 --> 31:51.860
Good job, dude

31:51.860 --> 31:58.540
with all of this being understood the current public narrative regarding skullgirls is that the two original creators a hat and

31:58.660 --> 32:01.420
Zymont were slowly weaseled out of their successful

32:01.600 --> 32:05.820
profitable IP their life's work their dream and the current owners being

32:05.940 --> 32:12.080
Progressives with no respect for the property its history the original creators vision or frankly what the fans want are now

32:12.380 --> 32:18.020
Repurposing skullgirls to suit their needs updating it for modern standards by removing what people love from the game

32:18.020 --> 32:24.540
I understand why that's the public narrative considering how often this sort of thing happens nowadays and how it looks from the outside

32:24.540 --> 32:28.860
But it's also not completely accurate. There is more going on here

32:28.860 --> 32:30.340
But in order to understand it

32:30.340 --> 32:35.500
We're gonna have to dive into a topic that has until very recently largely flown under the radar

32:35.900 --> 32:43.340
Part four the lawsuit while the initial idea for the skullgirls universe might have come from Alex a hat and the game engine from Mike

32:43.340 --> 32:47.060
Zymont they aren't the only people who have been attached to the project since the very beginning

32:47.540 --> 32:54.500
Marielle Cartwright one of the original animators who was on the skullgirls project from day one of it hitting reverb labs is just as

32:54.580 --> 32:59.860
Crucial to the development of the game as the two boys are and she is the central focus of the skullgirls lawsuit

33:00.140 --> 33:03.980
After lab zero games collapsed and Mike Z laid off all remaining staff

33:04.140 --> 33:08.300
Marielle Cartwright got together with the company's financial officer and producer for indivisible

33:08.460 --> 33:10.860
Francesca Esquenazi and in early 2021

33:10.860 --> 33:17.540
They fired off a lawsuit against lab zero games and Mike Z for wrongful termination on April 1st, 2021

33:17.540 --> 33:19.060
I bet they thought it was an April Fool's joke

33:19.060 --> 33:23.580
Mike filed a countersuit with Superior Court of the state of California against Marielle and

33:23.620 --> 33:29.300
Francesca and against the company that all the lab zero games former employees had founded to continue the skullgirls work

33:29.460 --> 33:31.460
Future Club the court document is

33:31.980 --> 33:34.700
207 pages long and linked in the description if you want to read it for yourself

33:35.060 --> 33:42.980
The claims Mike makes within the documents are backed up with dozens upon dozens of pages filled with internal chat logs at lab zero games

33:43.120 --> 33:48.060
Private messages between Mike Marielle and Francesca and public communications that provide additional context

33:48.100 --> 33:52.820
So let's dive in the court docs begin with describing skullgirls and lab zero games

33:52.820 --> 33:55.260
Which we already know about as well as what a slack channel is

33:55.460 --> 34:02.100
Presumably because the American court system is full of boomers and then we get to the third section titled my history of autism spectrum disorder

34:02.220 --> 34:07.700
Mike described what he had known all of his life as Mike being Mike an inability to understand social boundaries

34:07.900 --> 34:11.140
Maintain friendships and just generally deal with people properly

34:11.140 --> 34:16.660
He confided in Marielle and Francesca whom he described as his close friends and with their encouragement

34:16.660 --> 34:21.180
He eventually went to a therapist and got an autism diagnosis in the next section

34:21.180 --> 34:25.940
He describes his friendship with Marielle Cartwright in 2010 Marielle was brought on to Reverge labs

34:26.300 --> 34:31.500
Specifically to work as an animator for skullgirls under Alex a had who was I think the creative director

34:31.500 --> 34:33.980
She would become the lead animator in 2012

34:34.100 --> 34:40.820
Mike and Marielle became close friends talking and going on walks frequently in Marielle's public statement when she left lab zero games

34:40.820 --> 34:46.140
She claimed that Mike harassed her at work. There was years of sexual comments uncomfortable jokes unwanted hugs

34:46.180 --> 34:53.060
He apparently suggested she helped him masturbate she claimed to talk to him about how uncomfortable she felt in 2017 and in return

34:53.060 --> 34:54.380
He called her a hypocrite

34:54.380 --> 35:01.060
Marielle says that this hypocrisy stemmed from how she dressed in public implying that Mike believed her way of dressing allowed him to sexually

35:01.060 --> 35:04.860
Harass her. However, this isn't the whole story in the court documents

35:04.860 --> 35:07.940
Mike provides tons of slack logs showing on-the-job

35:08.420 --> 35:16.100
Conversations as well as Marielle's private messages to him directly where she regularly engaged in conversations with him about sex sexual orientation

35:16.340 --> 35:17.940
urination pornography

35:17.940 --> 35:23.700
prostitution threesomes plastic surgery body image issues and on and on she began these

35:23.980 --> 35:31.100
Conversations herself and expected him to participate her behavior led Mike to believe that this type of talk was welcome and ordinary in the course

35:31.100 --> 35:37.700
Of their friendship. She also regularly engaged in this type of talk with other co-workers and drew pornographic artwork while on the clock

35:37.700 --> 35:44.040
Which she displayed in the office at least that's how Mike characterized these chat logs in the court documents

35:44.040 --> 35:48.600
And you know being somebody who's around their age. I'm a millennial. They're Millennials. We're all in our 30s

35:48.600 --> 35:55.400
This is how people of my age group talk when they're friends and not just you know casual work

35:55.720 --> 36:03.080
Acquaintances all of these logs read to me like they were actually genuine friends and that whatever banter they have going on is

36:03.400 --> 36:08.560
Clearly welcome and also a two-way street. Also. I'm not getting Naomi to do the voice for this one

36:08.560 --> 36:11.500
I don't think she wants to do a stereotypical Asian accent

36:14.040 --> 36:16.040
I

36:16.200 --> 36:21.160
Francesca Esquenazi had a similar friendship with Mike. He met her while she was working at a GameStop in

36:21.600 --> 36:24.800
2005 before either of them had begun their professional careers in

36:25.680 --> 36:29.060
2007 while Mike was working as a programmer at pandemic studios

36:29.060 --> 36:32.120
He was able to get her a job as a receptionist this began

36:32.240 --> 36:35.720
Francesca's career working in the paper-pushing side of the games industry in

36:36.320 --> 36:39.160
2016 he brought her into the skullgirls project as a producer

36:39.360 --> 36:46.320
Mike and Francesca's friendship was similar to Mike and Mariel's with lewd or inappropriate topics of conversation being a part of the normal course

36:46.320 --> 36:52.620
Of their interactions and again, it wasn't one-sided. They both began these conversations and expected the other to participate

36:52.720 --> 36:58.240
They had been friends for 15 years and Mike describes several personal events that he helped her through weddings

36:58.680 --> 37:04.360
Tragedies Mike helped Francesca come to terms with the death of her child the subsequent gender transition of her husband

37:04.360 --> 37:08.080
How her marriage and sex life were affected how menstruation made her feel inadequate?

37:08.520 --> 37:11.840
Mike took up a role of stability in Francesca's personal life

37:12.280 --> 37:16.780
Next up in the court documents is Mike describing in detail the bunny a you canceling event

37:16.780 --> 37:21.000
You know, it makes sense that they be in the court docs because it is one of the big events that led to the destruction of

37:21.000 --> 37:21.720
lab zero games

37:21.720 --> 37:28.220
But it's still kind of surreal to see internet shit in a court filing Mike confirms that his conversation with bunny a you happened on May

37:28.240 --> 37:35.120
13th 2020 when bunny released her version of these DMS after the George Floyd joke in late June of 2020

37:35.160 --> 37:38.480
They showed that she took the screen caps when the DMS were one day old

37:38.600 --> 37:46.140
This means that bunny deliberately sat on these DMS until she could release that the most opportune moment for maximum damage to Mike

37:46.240 --> 37:52.920
He also revealed that bunny privately apologized to him something that was left out of the original version of events on June 29th

37:52.920 --> 37:56.160
Mike expressed his frustrations to Mariel over the situation

37:56.320 --> 38:02.980
Highlighting the obvious double standard when bunny a you makes the conversation about sexuality and skull girls and her own sexually charged career

38:03.500 --> 38:09.580
But when Mike engages with the conversation on that level bunny frames it as if he would never talk to a man in the fighting

38:09.580 --> 38:16.340
Game community like this in response Mariel said directly to Mike that all men have to deal with the result of what shitty men have

38:16.340 --> 38:20.980
Done but also that she didn't want him to quit lab zero games and that if she had the power to fire him

38:20.980 --> 38:26.340
She wouldn't over this the conversations tone seems to imply that Mariel knows Mike is innocent

38:26.340 --> 38:32.140
But also that her progressive politics apply a collective male guilt to him that she isn't directly pushing but that he is

38:32.260 --> 38:34.620
Rejecting and she is uncomfortable with that rejection

38:35.140 --> 38:38.920
Meanwhile in a conversation between Francesca and Mariel where Mike isn't present

38:39.040 --> 38:45.520
Francesca directly says that she thinks a bunny a you baited Mike that bunny started the conversation weird that she didn't believe that Mike meant

38:45.520 --> 38:49.980
To demean bunny and that bunny deliberately cut out Mike's apology in order to paint him a certain way

38:50.360 --> 38:54.620
Mariel agreed with Francesca's assessment in the public lab zero slack channel

38:54.620 --> 39:00.400
They reiterated this position saying that Mike was innocent at the same time in a previous slack channel for women only Mariel

39:00.680 --> 39:06.520
Francesca and several female employees outline that they've all had experiences with Mike where he's been inappropriate

39:06.520 --> 39:11.000
But also that they all know he doesn't do it purposefully. He's been apologetic every time it's happened

39:11.000 --> 39:13.440
He's worked to make up for it and he genuinely tries to be better

39:13.440 --> 39:17.240
But also that his autism makes it hard for him one employee asks

39:17.240 --> 39:20.640
How many fires are we going to have to put out and that if it wasn't for his autism?

39:20.640 --> 39:22.640
This would be a lot more cut and dry

39:22.680 --> 39:27.440
This is where the scheme to take control of lab zero games began with Mariel and Francesca

39:27.600 --> 39:33.520
Understanding full well that Mike was doing his best with them openly admitting that they truly believed he was but nonetheless

39:33.800 --> 39:39.480
Reluctantly deciding that it was time to take control from him. Well, it was reluctant initially by the end of June 29th

39:39.480 --> 39:44.560
They were privately messaging each other discussing removing Mike from his leadership position on June 30th

39:44.780 --> 39:51.760
Francesca and Mariel scheduled two team meetings one with Mike present and one without they were scheduled in the company's Google Calendar

39:51.760 --> 39:54.420
We only have Mike's word as to what happened at the one meeting

39:54.900 --> 39:59.140
He claims that the two women encouraged all of the employees to bash him to his face

39:59.260 --> 40:03.980
He admits to crying during the meeting and being forced to explain his autism to the entire company

40:03.980 --> 40:06.660
The woman then ended the meeting by claiming it was a waste of time

40:06.740 --> 40:10.780
It was at this point that Mike believes Francesca and Mariel had a change of heart

40:10.780 --> 40:11.920
They were no longer

40:11.920 --> 40:17.500
Understanding about his autism or his good faith efforts to fix things they no longer care that he was innocent with regards to bunny

40:17.500 --> 40:24.280
Are you and they were beginning to retroactively redefine all of their past interactions as harassment an hour after the meeting Mariel

40:24.280 --> 40:30.560
Formed a new slack channel called Z Z Z where everyone but Mike was present with the express purpose of planning to undermine

40:30.560 --> 40:35.800
Mike's ownership of lab zero games one of their plans involved removing Mike from a leadership and

40:36.000 --> 40:38.760
Ownership position and allowing him to stay on as a contractor

40:39.140 --> 40:44.040
Francesca pitched the idea of the entire team up and leaving seeing as they still had connections and options

40:44.440 --> 40:50.320
Mariel says that she still considers Mike a friend but that he's destroying the team and he has to go they discussed the peril of

40:50.320 --> 40:54.840
Having to explain to the publisher of the next game focus all of this internal turmoil and how it will affect

40:55.040 --> 41:01.600
Focuses support and funding of lab zero games and then Mariel says this I oh no, this is manipulative

41:01.600 --> 41:04.400
I wonder if it would go over better if Mike stepped down on his own

41:04.400 --> 41:09.280
It will look bad to focus if Franny and I asked Mike to leave but if Mike steps down it would be better

41:09.320 --> 41:15.220
This was the beginning of Mariel's plot to manipulate Mike to voluntarily step down from his own company by intentionally

41:15.360 --> 41:19.840
Misrepresenting the situation to focus as she was afraid of them pulling funding for lab zeros next game

41:20.000 --> 41:25.600
Part of this plot involved absolutely nothing of this going public as Mariel directly stated. Yes. It looks bad

41:25.600 --> 41:28.320
But if we make a public statement that makes us look slightly better

41:28.320 --> 41:30.480
But then lose all of our jobs and close the company

41:30.480 --> 41:32.680
What good will that have done by the end of the day?

41:32.800 --> 41:37.320
Francesca had drafted an email to focus as the launching of their plan and Mariel approved of it

41:37.320 --> 41:42.000
They intended to manipulate Mike into stepping down by misrepresenting their upcoming meeting with focus

41:42.280 --> 41:46.920
Specifically the two told Mike that unless he was gone focus was pulling out in a future meeting

41:47.080 --> 41:49.560
Representatives from focus directly denied this to Mike's face

41:49.560 --> 41:57.480
In fact, Francesca later admitted that what they had said regarding focus and Mike was not true while she characterized it as a misunderstanding

41:57.880 --> 42:00.640
This statement reads like she got caught and she knows it

42:00.840 --> 42:07.480
Mariel had concocted the whole story that focus was pulling out if Mike wasn't gone under the belief that focus would continue to work with

42:07.480 --> 42:11.680
Them if they managed to get rid of Mike themselves the next day July 1st

42:11.800 --> 42:17.240
2020 the group was discussing forming a new company without Mike still using lab zeros official slack

42:17.360 --> 42:23.760
They explicitly stated they intended to take over all of lab zeros contracts with Mariel and Francesca at the helm of a new company

42:23.800 --> 42:27.320
Without any of the baggage of lab zero games and none of its debt

42:27.560 --> 42:33.060
They were aware that this meant leaving Mike with the responsibility of paying focus back all of the money

42:33.060 --> 42:38.280
They provided to fund the next game along with other business debts totaling around one and a half million dollars

42:38.280 --> 42:43.060
They initially didn't seem thrilled at the idea of leaving Mike with all the lab zero debt

42:43.060 --> 42:49.280
But as the summer dragged on they warmed up to the idea with Mariel at one point threatening to use the debt as a weapon

42:49.280 --> 42:56.300
Against him. It's at this point that as their plans began to develop Mariel and Francesca began to harden against Mike's autism reasoning

42:56.300 --> 42:59.880
Which they had accepted just a few days prior on July 4th 2020

42:59.880 --> 43:04.520
Mariel said I don't buy as excuse of a checklist and never trying to hurt anyone to do anything bad anymore

43:04.520 --> 43:10.320
And I don't accept autism as an excuse anymore while Francesca said that though she doesn't think Mike is a monster

43:10.320 --> 43:12.760
She also doesn't feel like she can believe anything

43:12.760 --> 43:19.720
he says anymore as an explanation even though Mariel and Francesca had previously stated that they knew Mike didn't harass anybody and

43:19.920 --> 43:22.000
Falsely accusing him of harassment would ruin his life

43:22.000 --> 43:28.560
They had decided to maliciously characterize his conduct as harassment in order to drum up public support for their new company

43:28.560 --> 43:33.480
But specifically in a way that protects them Mariel said we can't acknowledge any lack of knowledge

43:33.840 --> 43:39.000
Enabling or wrongdoing because that validates Max's claims and allows him to come after us

43:39.000 --> 43:44.800
The other ones also open us up to Mike coming after us for defamation. The defamation thing is obvious

43:44.800 --> 43:46.160
But who is this max guy?

43:46.160 --> 43:52.260
The only person named max who once worked at lab zero games is apparently a person named max gone

43:52.260 --> 43:57.800
At least that's his profile over at art station calm under the screen named B's all aka our friend. Mr

43:57.800 --> 44:00.780
Beezwell from earlier the Latino who accused Mike of violent threats

44:00.780 --> 44:04.960
But never actually provide any proof of them in his long thread full of bullshit nonsense

44:04.960 --> 44:10.100
He actually blames Mariel and Francesca for enabling and supporting Mike's mistreatment

44:10.220 --> 44:13.160
This meant that Mariel and Francesca had a tight line to walk

44:13.240 --> 44:16.520
They needed to make the claim that Mike was actually the harasser

44:16.520 --> 44:23.720
They previously said that he wasn't while at the same time at not giving any ammo to mr. Beezwell that frames them as harassers themselves

44:24.040 --> 44:26.680
Bitches be calculating by July 16th

44:26.880 --> 44:33.720
Mariel began characterizing Mike as the aggressor and reframing all of their past actions within an abuser victim dynamic

44:33.860 --> 44:40.440
By August 6th Mariel seemed to simply view Mike as an enemy saying I don't even want to like get him back or ruin of

44:40.440 --> 44:46.600
Her anything just leave please just leave forever the plan for everybody to abandon lab zero games was underway

44:46.880 --> 44:53.800
Employees were waiting for a specific time that time came and on August 24th 2020 the implosion of lab zero games was underway

44:54.200 --> 44:57.140
Employees announced the resignation in unison including Mariel

44:57.640 --> 45:04.220
Francesca due to her access to the company's financial information knew that quitting at this specific time would maximize damage to the company

45:04.220 --> 45:10.320
It was just before payroll was going out for the next month and the conspirators had managed to convince focus not to pay them their

45:10.320 --> 45:17.160
Next reimbursement with no money coming in and no staff to perform any work lab zero games was forced to shutter its doors and lay

45:17.160 --> 45:24.020
Off any remaining employees including Francesca by September 6th 2020 Kim McCaskill a woman who works in the games

45:24.040 --> 45:28.880
Industry and who is well known for her strong public stance against the sexual harassment of women in game development

45:29.440 --> 45:34.760
Privately spoke to all parties involved and discovered that none of them even mentioned harassment at Simon's hands at all

45:34.760 --> 45:37.600
In fact the whole thing appeared like they were using the sexual

45:37.640 --> 45:45.000
Harassment claim to drag Simon through the mud in retaliation for him not following through on making lab zero games a worker cooperative

45:45.520 --> 45:47.120
Apparently due to the negative experience

45:47.120 --> 45:53.880
everybody had working at Reverge labs the long term plan for lab zero games after Mike Z took over was that he would turn it

45:53.880 --> 45:58.420
Into a worker cooperative a business model where all workers have an equal share of company ownership

45:58.840 --> 46:01.760
However, there were two reasons as to why this wasn't possible

46:02.600 --> 46:09.580
Firstly it turns out that lab zeros corporate lawyer went over the options with Mike Mariel and Francesca and told them that giving the employees

46:09.580 --> 46:15.440
A bunch of stock in the company in order to make it into a worker co-op would massively raise those employees taxes

46:15.440 --> 46:16.600
Which does make sense?

46:16.600 --> 46:22.520
They now have a lot more net worth being part owners of a successful company the employees didn't want to pay more taxes

46:22.520 --> 46:28.200
Obviously, but Mariel and Francesca interpreted this event as proof that Mike was refusing to fulfill his promise to the team

46:28.440 --> 46:34.760
However back on June 29th Mariel admitted outright she understood the reason the company was in a co-op wasn't Mike's fault

46:34.760 --> 46:37.880
He was more than willing. It was a legal problem on June 30th

46:37.880 --> 46:43.720
She said that the team should only buy up shares of lab zero games and turn it into a worker co-op that way if Mike

46:43.720 --> 46:48.480
Were gone on July 2nd at Mariel no longer trust him with the shares on July 27th

46:48.480 --> 46:53.880
Mariel says that no one's paying Mike anything for his shares of the company the implication being that they just want it for free

46:54.120 --> 46:56.000
Something that was legally difficult

46:56.000 --> 46:59.720
Secondly all of the new co-owners would be on the hook for lab zeros debt

47:00.040 --> 47:06.200
Mariel broke down the details of the 1.5 million dollar business debt in one of the chat logs focus is owed

47:07.360 --> 47:10.440
$775,000 that is their publishers investment into their next game

47:10.440 --> 47:14.440
Which they expect game sales to recoup if the game doesn't come out they're on the hook for the money

47:14.960 --> 47:20.440
Arsenal is owed $100,000. That's the company's agent Brandon is owed $40,000

47:20.440 --> 47:24.240
That's the company's lawyer seems like they had some bills that needed paying Alex is owed

47:24.640 --> 47:29.160
$50,000 that's Alex a had settlement that was mentioned earlier and Peter is owed

47:30.200 --> 47:38.320
$450,000 who's Peter a PlayStation blog post about skullgirls was credited to Peter Bartholow the CEO of lab zero games a

47:38.400 --> 47:44.680
quick internet search reveals that Peter Bartholow began his career as a games journalist writing about video games in newspapers back in

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
1994 through industry connections he made in journalism

47:48.120 --> 47:51.000
He landed a job with origin systems working on Ultima games

47:51.240 --> 47:56.840
This began his game development career, and he worked at multiple studios before ending up with Reverge labs in 2010

47:56.960 --> 48:00.880
He was one of the people who made the move from Reverge labs to lab zero games

48:01.120 --> 48:07.280
Peter being the only member of Reverge labs with any business experience and having any capital became the company's sole owner

48:07.720 --> 48:13.880
According to Mike's court documents an unnamed CEO and sole shareholder of lab zero games left the company in

48:14.000 --> 48:19.160
2018 upon which Mike became the new owner this had to have been Peter the timeline matches up

48:19.200 --> 48:21.200
So why was Peter Bartholow owed?

48:22.000 --> 48:27.820
$450,000 was it compensation for his initial seed capital was it a settlement like Alex a had well at one point

48:28.120 --> 48:31.640
Francesca mentions offhandedly when I was getting really sick of all the Peter crap

48:31.640 --> 48:35.260
I mentioned I might want to leave and start my own thing the company lawyer

48:35.320 --> 48:40.480
Meanwhile in an email mentions what he calls the Peter buyout. This is just speculation on my part

48:40.480 --> 48:41.260
We don't have the whole story

48:41.260 --> 48:45.520
But it sounds like the team ended up disliking Peter and at some point in 2018

48:45.520 --> 48:50.040
Bought his share of the company in order to be rid of him which the company still owed debt on

48:50.480 --> 48:55.520
Also, it's possible that Alex left around the same time as Peter. Yeah, I'm jumping ahead in the story

48:55.520 --> 48:58.280
There's circumstantial evidence that kind of proves this later in the video

48:58.280 --> 49:04.600
Which is interesting because it implies a pattern of people at the bottom of lab zero games purposely pushing out the people at the top

49:05.000 --> 49:11.400
Marielle even admits as much on July 1st. I don't think I feel comfortable staying at lab zero if Mike is gone

49:11.520 --> 49:13.280
That's not in defense of Mike

49:13.280 --> 49:19.320
But rather what it means for what the studio has become and how that impacts us who remain lab zero has so much baggage

49:19.640 --> 49:26.200
We've rightfully hosted all the people we need to but what remains is not the company that was founded initially and we're left with all

49:26.200 --> 49:33.160
the stories the hurt the literal lawsuits and settlements and hundreds of thousands of dollars owed to people and on a personal note Tyson

49:33.240 --> 49:39.440
Expressed he was nervous for how all this makes me and Franny look as people who weren't at the top that kicked all key members

49:39.440 --> 49:44.520
Out and now lead the company. It's entirely possible that Peter left due to workplace disputes

49:44.800 --> 49:50.560
Alex left due to workplace disputes Mike was being pushed out due to workplace disputes while Marielle and

49:50.720 --> 49:58.000
Francesca both served to benefit from all the original core players moving on while also being at least part of the reason why they

49:58.000 --> 50:00.720
Moved on but that's just my personal conjecture

50:01.240 --> 50:04.240
Finally on September 23rd one of the employees that left

50:04.400 --> 50:08.540
DM to Mike directly on discord and said that it was actually all about

50:08.600 --> 50:13.140
Ownership of company in the end that everyone else was tired of waiting for equity distribution

50:13.160 --> 50:20.060
During the public collapse of lab zero games one of the former employees Brian June had been answering questions on Twitter

50:20.060 --> 50:23.160
That's where we got the information about Alex's settlement. For example

50:23.160 --> 50:29.180
He also said however that Mike was never intended to be the owner of lab zero games after Peter had been bought out

50:29.660 --> 50:32.420
Ownership was transferred to him temporarily for legal safety

50:32.420 --> 50:38.000
But everyone had agreed to eventually turn the business into a worker co-op and Mike seemed to be trying to do just that

50:38.300 --> 50:43.180
The roadblocks appear to be legal not personal but everybody blamed him and retaliated against him

50:43.180 --> 50:49.100
Anyway, when he finally wielded the legal power of ownership that he held against the employees trying to dethrone him

50:49.100 --> 50:52.800
They took it as a sign that Mike was never going to play ball and was just stringing them along

50:52.900 --> 50:58.300
but Mike wielded that power because he believed he was being set up as a fall guy for all the problems a

50:58.300 --> 51:03.220
Belief that the slack messages seemed to corroborate. So since we're pretty deep into the weeds here

51:03.220 --> 51:06.060
Let me give you a quick recap of what we discovered from the court documents

51:06.260 --> 51:11.760
Reverge labs collapses like a decade ago the core team reforms as lab zero games with Peter as CEO

51:12.060 --> 51:20.240
Alex Mike Mariel and anyone else important to skullgirls comes along for the ride over the years a Peter and Alex both leave under weird

51:20.580 --> 51:25.540
circumstances what we do know is that the company owes them money and Mariel states that her and

51:25.660 --> 51:30.420
Francesca removing them and moving into more of a management role themselves was good and necessary

51:31.260 --> 51:34.260
Skullgirls development winds down and the focus shifts to indivisible

51:34.480 --> 51:39.540
After Peter and Alex are gone Mike owns the company and everyone agrees to turn it into a worker co-op

51:39.620 --> 51:44.580
Mike has significant legal troubles trying to do so in June of 2020 several public

51:44.780 --> 51:51.180
Controversies go viral all stemming from Mike's autism and social awkwardness each of which he apologizes profusely for on

51:51.500 --> 51:59.460
August 24th 2020 a huge swath of lab zero games is staff all resign at the same time having coordinated their responses with

51:59.580 --> 52:03.300
Francesca's financial data in order to cause maximum damage to the company

52:03.580 --> 52:08.900
Despite the former staffs public statements claiming that they've spent the summer of 2020 engaged in an internal investigation

52:09.380 --> 52:16.120
Their private chat logs show that they were already creating plans to either remove Mike from his own company or quit and form a new

52:16.120 --> 52:23.080
Company one day after the bunny au thing went viral before anyone even knew the truth of it if they managed to wrestle control

52:23.080 --> 52:29.720
Of lab zero games their long-term plan was to keep Mike on as a contractor to wrap up any remaining work on the current projects

52:29.720 --> 52:33.960
Before eventually quietly firing him if not they would all quit in unison

52:33.960 --> 52:39.120
Which is what they did and use their knowledge of lab zero games as inner workings to saddle Mike with the business debt

52:39.200 --> 52:44.900
Steal and use the skullgirls contract as a quick moneymaker to get on their feet and then move on to different projects

52:45.120 --> 52:52.180
They explicitly schemed to use Mike's various viral controversies as a public justification for these actions

52:52.340 --> 52:55.820
The man they were friends with for 10 years in a matter of weeks

52:55.820 --> 53:02.980
They went from being understanding to hating him even as they learned more about his neurodivergency in that same time frame

53:02.980 --> 53:03.740
Oh also

53:03.740 --> 53:10.580
Maryland Francesca knew they were doing some fucky shit because despite Mike's lawyer telling them they should not delete messages on lab zero games

53:10.580 --> 53:13.860
Slack they tried to delete messages on lab zero games as slack

53:14.100 --> 53:18.860
With all this shit stacked against them what Mike filed ultimately was a countersuit

53:19.140 --> 53:23.140
Remember Maryland Francesca filed against him first for wrongful termination

53:23.140 --> 53:24.780
I guess they saw the fat

53:24.780 --> 53:28.900
Paychecks that Alex and Peter were getting and decided to get some of that for themselves on the way out the door

53:29.280 --> 53:36.780
Also the chat logs show them shifting from empathetic towards Mike and reluctant to take action against their friend in June 2020 to outright

53:36.780 --> 53:38.700
Hating him by August of 2020

53:38.780 --> 53:44.960
It's certainly possible that by January of 2021 when they filed the suit all feelings of friendship were gone

53:44.960 --> 53:47.440
And they simply viewed Mike as a resource to exploit

53:47.740 --> 53:50.320
But I think they overextended their hand on this one

53:50.660 --> 53:53.400
Francesca was laid off because the company could no longer do any work

53:53.400 --> 53:59.420
That's not wrongful termination and Mariel didn't quit she resigned but maybe she means the disbanding of the board who knows

53:59.500 --> 54:05.180
But what we do know is that Mike only slapped them with all of this shit after they came for him legally

54:05.380 --> 54:12.100
Mike countersued Mariel Francesca and Future Club for interfering with lab zero games as contracts and relationships

54:12.100 --> 54:17.380
Which had fallen apart due to the two women's plans who are now CEO and creative director of Future Club

54:17.420 --> 54:24.500
respectively the damages stem from losing the skullgirls contract the shutdown of the indivisible game including the loss of a contract for an

54:24.580 --> 54:26.180
unannounced but in production

54:26.180 --> 54:33.440
Indivisible animated series with NBC as well as an unannounced contract with Arc System Works the creator of guilty gear that Bridget game

54:33.640 --> 54:38.640
Lab zero games was going to be collaborating on probably the biggest anime fighting IP in the world

54:38.840 --> 54:42.740
Mariel and Francesca tried to get the countersuit dismissed using anti slap laws

54:43.200 --> 54:48.980
slap stands for strategic lawsuit against public participation and it refers to people using the courts and the threat of

54:49.000 --> 54:52.100
Lawsuit to intimidate those who are exercising their First Amendment rights

54:52.400 --> 54:58.120
most of the time anti slap laws come into play when somebody with influence threatens those who are speaking out against them with a

54:58.120 --> 55:04.480
Lawsuit in order to stifle their speech and this is what Mariel and Francesca alleged that Mike's detailed countersuit was intended to do

55:04.480 --> 55:08.720
In fact their lawyer compared the situation to Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels

55:09.000 --> 55:15.760
But in March of 2022 the judge disagreed ruling that the countersuit can proceed that this wasn't a free speech issue

55:15.760 --> 55:19.320
But a labor relations issue, but by April of 2023

55:19.320 --> 55:25.120
It seems like the anti slap denial had been overturned and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings

55:25.200 --> 55:31.800
I'm actually not really sure since this case isn't being talked about anywhere online right now and all the official documents are heavy in legalese

55:31.800 --> 55:38.720
but it sounds like where the case is at right now is that the court agrees that Mariel and Francesca's case arises in part from

55:38.720 --> 55:45.080
Their public statements relevant to a public issue and therefore Mike's countersuit may be a malicious use of the court against them

55:45.080 --> 55:52.140
But only if Mike's own case against them is baseless and the court outlined four of Mike's complaints that he might actually

55:52.380 --> 55:57.860
Legally win on on their merits independent of the woman's public speech and so they sent the whole thing back to trial

55:57.940 --> 56:03.420
So who knows where this goes the best I can tell is that their day in court has been set for February 6 2024

56:03.660 --> 56:06.020
Man, now this video feels kind of incomplete, doesn't it?

56:06.020 --> 56:10.100
I considered waiting to do this until the court date, you know to have a nice little bow to tie in the whole story

56:10.100 --> 56:13.220
But who knows how long the trial might take it might be postponed

56:13.220 --> 56:18.540
It might get appealed the Mike's I'm on versus future Club legal battle has already been quietly going on for two years

56:18.620 --> 56:20.620
And it could go on for another two

56:20.660 --> 56:23.220
Unfortunately, though that means we're all just sitting here with blue balls

56:23.340 --> 56:28.140
But maybe I can offer you something else to tide you over until then part 5

56:28.580 --> 56:34.580
Mariel Cartwright of the main woman in this lawsuit Francesca Esquenazi is clearly the more elusive of the two

56:34.740 --> 56:40.580
She spoke significantly less in the slack channels than her counterpart and there's not much in the way of public appearances of her out there

56:40.580 --> 56:42.260
I'm personally not surprised

56:42.260 --> 56:47.880
Remember she was a GameStop clerk that Mike basically turned into a receptionist and she worked primarily in the

56:48.040 --> 56:51.640
Financial and administrative side of the business but Mariel Cartwright

56:51.640 --> 56:55.520
She's an animator by trade and the internet is littered with her various public appearances

56:55.520 --> 56:59.800
A lot of these are simply animation workshops or doing press tours for games

56:59.800 --> 57:04.480
But others are personal interviews and in those interviews, she said some very interesting things

57:04.840 --> 57:10.480
So let's take a look at who Mariel Cartwright is at least who she appears to be from my point of view

57:10.800 --> 57:14.560
There's a handful of primary sources. I'm going to be jumping between in order to make my point

57:14.600 --> 57:16.760
They're all publicly available on YouTube

57:16.760 --> 57:20.240
So if you think I'm somehow misrepresenting Mariel or I've got something wrong

57:20.240 --> 57:23.920
They are all available for you to watch yourself. The major interviews

57:23.920 --> 57:26.460
I'm going to be talking about are in chronological order one

57:26.720 --> 57:32.480
Mariel's first ever on-camera appearance in an interview with Destructoid on December 23rd 2012

57:32.900 --> 57:39.280
Two an interview of multiple lab zero games artists for the black torch anthology, which seems to be an art book

57:39.280 --> 57:41.280
They all worked on on May 9th 2013

57:41.880 --> 57:49.280
Three a panel on how to animate for video games that Mariel gave at a digital dragons convention on July 1st 2014

57:49.800 --> 57:56.160
Four an interview that Mariel gave to the fighting game YouTube channel Pat the flip on February 2nd 2016

57:56.440 --> 58:02.800
Five a GDC presentation of indivisible hosted by Mariel and Mike on October 11th 2019

58:03.120 --> 58:09.440
Six an interview Mariel and her husband Tyson gave for mega 64 on July 25th 2020

58:09.440 --> 58:16.520
And finally seven an interview Mariel gave with the horror game Awards on October 30th 2023, which is just a week ago

58:16.800 --> 58:20.120
There's also a few other clips that I couldn't get an exact date on but they're short ones

58:20.120 --> 58:25.180
I'll make sure to display on screen exactly which source I'm pulling the statements from let's get into it

58:25.520 --> 58:32.440
Mariel's dad is an animator for Disney and her mother is a Japanese citizen. My dad was a Disney animator for most of my childhood

58:33.560 --> 58:36.320
and my mom is Japanese

58:37.040 --> 58:39.920
So it was just like this this blend of

58:41.300 --> 58:45.640
You know Japanese culture Japanese films just you know, everything Japanese

58:46.640 --> 58:48.260
combined with

58:48.260 --> 58:50.260
My dad is a gigantic nerd

58:51.640 --> 58:53.640
So it's Disney animation

58:54.040 --> 58:55.920
He you know, he had the Atari

58:55.920 --> 59:01.680
He was doing like a little bit of programming and he would get me into video games and stuff a quick Google search of Disney

59:01.680 --> 59:07.220
Animators with the family named Cartwright revealed a Randy Cartwright who had a very prolific career at Disney

59:07.220 --> 59:13.100
He was offered a job at a Japanese studio in the 80s where he trained Japanese animators on the general Disney style

59:13.480 --> 59:17.040
Mariel grew up as a Sega kid and was in love with Sonic back in the 90s

59:21.680 --> 59:23.680
Sonic

59:32.360 --> 59:34.200
When I was like

59:34.200 --> 59:38.600
maybe nine or so, my dad gave me a oh my goddess and

59:39.600 --> 59:40.600
Rama

59:40.600 --> 59:45.680
Look that he didn't need anymore. And then from there I started getting into all that kind of stuff

59:46.360 --> 59:50.920
She ended up spending a lot of time drawing influenced by both of her parents preferred art styles

59:51.000 --> 59:54.440
Was your father being an animator a burden or a help?

59:56.480 --> 59:58.940
No, it was it was definitely a good thing

59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.540
I remember

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:06.660
You know being very young and being able to go to my dad and ask questions about how you know

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:08.660
how do I draw this or that or

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:13.960
And you know, he would he would sometimes help out and be like, you know, ask me questions

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:17.260
like how do I think I would draw this and then he would show me the right way to do it and

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:25.540
No, he was he was great Mariel met the mega 64 guys at their first ever panel in 2006

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:31.540
She got to know them personally during this event and ended up helping them make a lot of their content mostly behind the scenes

01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:34.460
How did me and Mariel meet?

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.500
She was at

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:39.340
Our first panel. It's so weird

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:44.020
Because that we the first panel we ever did

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:51.180
was at anime Los Angeles in 2006, that was the first panel we ever did and

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:59.180
In that room that audience was maybe 50 to 80 people that was I mean that was it and

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:03.540
In yet in that group was more

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:06.540
People that would affect my life than any other

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:12.300
Like like I met Mariel and all her friends people other people that I grew to know

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:15.380
other famous artists

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:18.980
That work with her and

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:23.200
Worked in the game industry stuff like that. They were in there

01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:29.940
There there were other girls in there that I that I would later like years later like I dated

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:34.700
Like a couple different people who didn't even know each other in that same room

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:38.300
Who just happened to live in you know, Southern California?

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:43.260
I guess she would have been 18 at this time way before her professional animation career ever got started

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:46.740
You you're I mean, honestly, I think out of all the artists that we work with

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:52.660
I think we've been doing that stuff with you the longest I think of anybody I think

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:57.820
I was just saying I think it's like 14 or 15 years. I think I started this when I was

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:01.380
818 that's crazy

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:03.540
And I'm 33

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:11.580
Mariel attended the California Institute of the Arts otherwise known as Cal Arts. Well that explains a lot of the story we had like a

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:14.140
portfolio

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:17.020
Show thing at Cal Arts and I had all my stuff out and

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:22.060
normally the companies that come by are like Disney and DreamWorks and

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:24.920
You know big film companies like that

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:29.780
But who also was there was Matt Bozon at WayForward

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:33.300
Because WayForward is in the same city as Cal Arts

01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:39.600
And he saw my stuff and I think he he got things going he was you know

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.300
He was a fan of my stuff and he got things going for me at WayForward

01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:47.660
She met Jonathan Kim another Skullgirls artist while at Cal Arts and brought him into the project

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:52.540
The two of them as well as other creatives in their friend group ran what they characterized as an art

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:58.100
Collective called mecha fetus where they collaborated on various art pieces. Well, I met John

01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:00.140
persona in

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:01.580
college I

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:06.580
Went to Cal Arts for character animation and he was in my year and we became friends super quick

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:13.220
And he had the idea with another friend of his to start like an art collaborative

01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:17.220
group mecha fetus ran from their early college days in

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:21.900
2006 up until basically their professional careers took off and they no longer had time to work on it

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:25.340
I think people who have followed my work, I guess from the beginning

01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:30.140
Know my stuff from the mecha fetus visual blog

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:34.980
Which was me John Kim persona

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:37.660
Paul Robertson

01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:43.080
Eu03 and Brad Raffi and it was just a place where we

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:45.100
posted

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:51.300
Whatever really just it was just a place for us to post our earth that like wasn't deviant art or you know, whatever

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:57.340
And I think I don't know how I think it's because Paul already had a bit of a following

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:01.320
But people discovered that pretty quick. Yeah

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:08.040
And so we had like what what what time period were you doing the mecha fetus stuff mostly it was like

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.320
2006 or 7 to

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.320
Like it's sex because I don't want to say that

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:22.380
It's gone. Sure, or we're not gonna come back to it, but we haven't posted on it

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:26.160
But I mean, yeah, all of y'all are doing other things, right? Right. Yeah

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:33.680
The style of mecha fetus was described by Marielle as revolving around blood guts and naked girls your styles

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:39.320
are definitely different but there's reoccurring themes amongst all of you that being like

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.480
nudity

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:46.280
exposed brains and like intestines that are fun you like mix

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:54.680
Disgusting and sexy and cute all together. Am I right in thinking that that's kind of a unifying theme between um, I

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:59.000
Think that's that's most of a thing between Paul and I

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:03.200
We just like gross and cute things

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:08.640
I've always been like a fan of like horror scary stuff

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.440
and

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.400
Yeah, I mean that's that's kind of it

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.480
I just want to draw stuff that I think is cool

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:21.660
Mariel tells the story of how her career got started several times across these various interviews and though the story changes each time

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:24.700
It's mostly the same then I had my stuff at the job fair

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:28.700
I did not get noticed by anyone except

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:35.380
Family guy family guy sent me or requested like a storyboard test for me. All right

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:38.700
And then Matt bows on a way forward noticed my stuff

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:42.740
And that's actually kind of how my relationship with way forward started

01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:48.760
She had done a bit of freelance work in video games here and there making the UI for some Barbie game and most notably making

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:54.160
A couple of drawings for the joke ending for Silent Hill shattered memories. My first thing was actually

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:56.960
Silent Hill shattered memories

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:04.080
Wow, which completely yeah, it came out of nowhere. Like we were you know, we had done the busy vlog for a couple years

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.280
And then I got an email from Tom hill at Konami

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.120
Asking if I could

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:18.420
You know do the the joke ending the UFO ending for shattered memories and I said, yeah

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:26.040
I'd love to but through way forward. She got her first big job in the games industry the Scott Pilgrim game. He

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:30.240
Asks what artwork did you work on for the Scott Pilgrim game?

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:35.800
Oh, I know I was forgetting something Scott Pilgrim game that you worked on what a what a beautiful piece of work that game is

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:43.960
He says the game is awesome in the art style rocks. So what did you do on that game? Um, I was one of the animators

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.200
I was actually only freelance on it. I worked off-site

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:53.060
But I did all the background and PC characters

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.280
and

01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:00.040
I also did the title screen illustration which eventually was

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:04.240
Changed a bit in the final version, but I did the original of that

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:04.920
I

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:11.280
mentioned earlier in the video that the current fan narrative surrounding skullgirls is that the original creators Alex and Mike the ones who were truly

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:16.920
Passionate about skullgirls got screwed out of their own creation by progressives who don't give a shit about the property never worked on it

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.840
Never cared about it and now they're just ruining it

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.640
But this isn't true

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:27.400
Alex was another of Marielle's art friends and he brought her onto the skullgirls project before they pitched the concept to Reverge labs

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.400
I was a friend of Alex's and

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.800
In 2010, I think at the start of 2010 I started

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:39.880
Animating on the skullgirls just you know as one of my spare things

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:44.000
They started pitching it to different companies to see if anyone wanted to

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:52.960
Publish like pick up and fully develop skullgirls and I think we pitched it to like Ubisoft and maybe stag or something

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.560
and in the end it was

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:58.880
autumn autumn games who picked it up and

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:05.220
You know said we want to publish this game and we can fund a team develop it fully full-time

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:11.100
In fact Alex and Marielle were working on skullgirls before they even brought Mike on with his engine

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:16.660
Skullgirls started as an indie project originally as a pixel animated game in like

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.660
2004 ish

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:21.580
Alex was just working on it by himself at the time

01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:28.300
And over the course of a few years and after several iterations it made the transition from being a 2d pixel game

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:36.140
To a 2d HD game then we had who is now our lead game designer Mike Z join the project and with him came

01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:39.060
His own fighting game engine that he made himself

01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:41.780
He was working on that for a long time before

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:49.580
Mike has been very particular about this point saying consistently that he or the rest of the team aren't the creators of skullgirls

01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:55.540
Alex's at one point when Mike and Marielle were discussing indivisible in 2019 Marielle said this

01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:58.180
The designer

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:00.260
artist on skullgirls Alex Ahad

01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:04.820
You know was was a big part of it. He was the one that also designed all the monsters

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:08.620
Yeah creator of skullgirls

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.100
Yeah, so I think I think

01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:13.380
Now this might just be me reading into it

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:17.540
But I feel like the tone of this exchange is Marielle downplaying Alex's involvement

01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:23.700
Mike correcting the record and defending his friend who had left the company at this point by the way and Mariel quickly agreeing but

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:26.660
Rushing past the point but I could just be reading into it a little bit too much

01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:32.400
Mariel confirmed that only the core skullgirls people from Reverge labs moved over to lab zero games

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:36.460
The skullgirls team has made a new studio called lab zero games

01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:39.940
and we as a

01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:44.540
Smaller more of like the score the core skullgirls team

01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:50.180
We want to continue working on the game. She would later describe this as eight people in total

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:54.640
We have eight people in house we have four artists a programmer a designer

01:09:55.260 --> 01:10:02.020
An art production guy and our CEO. Okay, we've got Alex Mike Marielle John Peter the unnamed CEO

01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:07.100
In fact the way that Marielle describes him here as not a part of the creative process just the CEO

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:10.420
It really does sound like he just provided the initial startup capital

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:14.660
Like I theorized earlier Marielle describes this arrangement as not really being professional

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:17.620
They were just a big group of creative friends who wanted to make games together

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.980
The skullgirls team is made up of

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:26.400
Primarily 2d artists and animators and we worked with what we had as just a small indie team

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:30.740
We're just a big group of friends pretty much and in fact all throughout these videos

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:36.780
Marielle Alex all the artists that are interviewed they all seem to be part of some larger Southern California art scene

01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:42.120
I actually forgot to mention in my introduction that I'm also part of a lava punch one and two and the spaceman anthology

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:46.380
Which are the previous books that that this group has done before and I've known them since

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.700
since my days in bow, which is basically

01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:53.220
artist group gathering in the Bay Area Bay Area artists unite and

01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:57.420
I was I had met them through there back in high school

01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:02.180
So I guess I've known them for many years now speaking of that 2019 indivisible stream

01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:04.660
There's some very interesting things going on there

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:11.500
Mike and Marielle are very clearly comfortable with each other acting like old friends Marielle is in the PR role in this conversation

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:19.580
Being diplomatic hitting talking points while Mike is this zany all-over-the-place hyper creative type with no public speaking skills

01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:25.960
Probably the most blatant example of this dynamic is when Mike talks about why they didn't go with the epic game store for indivisible's release

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.780
What motivated your decision to sell the game where you do?

01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:32.380
I mean we're we talk to designers now and developers so often

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:37.680
A major point of contention is which store front to put the game on and which service to put it out on and that seems

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.680
only likely to grow more

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:43.840
Contentious in the years ahead. So tell me how did you think about how to sell this game?

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.560
And sort of why did you put it out the way you did?

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:50.920
I mean, I guess you're referring to like steam versus epic now is kind of the discussion that we're having right?

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:57.560
I mean, I guess I guess for us epic came so late in the game that it just didn't really impact our decision at all

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:00.120
I mean it just

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:04.540
Some part of it was that we already had a steam version that worked right? Yeah

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:07.900
Yeah, so it you know

01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:09.980
Consoles in

01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:15.740
PC Mac Linux. Yeah was just basically it at the time, you know that we made the decision

01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:19.680
Steam was the thing and so that's just kind of what we followed through

01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:22.460
so we haven't been to

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:30.740
Know what's watching

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:36.300
About the epic store like that they give you information to

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:39.100
Their Chinese owner

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:51.380
Because that was a weird thing for a minute I recall sorry it was a weird thing for a minute

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:57.060
I have no idea whether it was actually confirmed because we didn't come out on the epic store. So yeah

01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:59.460
I don't I don't want to I'm not trying to defend the epic store here

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:03.480
I'm just trying to make sure our claims do you know we're on a live stream here

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:07.040
So we don't we don't have the luxury of an editor. Yeah, so some have said

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:16.320
I think the bigger point is just that you know steam was our option when we were deciding and so that's what we just stuck

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:20.400
Yeah, but more interesting to me is how Mike and Mariel describe their workplace

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.680
How much do you let your staff provide creative input?

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:27.100
How do you organize staff input and how do you keep that input from clashing during production?

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:31.080
I think I think everyone has say

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:39.840
Yeah, that was that was exactly what I was gonna say and I'm I do not mean to speak over you sure sure

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.840
Well, I was just gonna say everyone

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:47.600
We encourage everyone to speak up just because I think a lot of the issues we ran into development

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.200
we were able to

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:55.280
Kind of like avoid or circumvent because someone spoke up and just just gave us an opinion that we weren't expecting

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.520
So we do try to encourage everyone to speak up as much as possible

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:04.680
But I think like Mike you and I we're both kind of like the vision holders

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.200
so we know that what we want out of the game and

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.160
And so, you know, we're always listening to feedback

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:18.520
But ultimately once a decision needs to be made it's gonna be made by you or I essentially we are as far as feedback goes

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:23.620
Completely flat and I don't want us to change that I've worked at places where it was like

01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:28.460
You say you would say something about art and the artist would be like, well, you're not an artist

01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:35.360
Like the artist would come to a designer and be like this parts been really frustrating like in me

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:41.140
Just playing it because I'm art in this part and the designer be like, yeah, well, you're not a designer. So shut up get out like

01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:48.180
That sucks because the feedback that you get that's usually the most useful is from the people that aren't in your discipline

01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:55.060
Right because they notice things that you are not trained or are trained to not notice anymore and like I

01:14:55.700 --> 01:15:01.360
try to listen to absolutely everybody from everywhere at all times and then

01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:06.500
Like the way that I put it on skull girls was I'll listen to everybody but the decision is mine

01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:11.980
They both genuinely seem to want a flat hierarchy where everyone has an equal say as team leads

01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:14.180
They do have to make the final choice that's inevitable

01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:18.020
But Mike seems genuinely committed to the idea of everyone being equal

01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:25.300
Elsewhere Mario characterized Mike as essential a talented genius that could do things by memory in a way. She'd never seen before the way

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:27.980
making moves for skull girls works is

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:34.800
That the artists kind of like all come together and brainstorm just a bunch of moves that they think would look awesome for the character

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.140
to do

01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:40.700
Just no limits. Just anything just kind of trying to keep in mind like well she needs to punch

01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:43.140
She needs to kick she needs some supers and you know all that stuff

01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:50.260
and then we pass that on to Mike Mike see who's the designer of skull girls who is just

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:55.620
Like the brain behind everything game play related at our company

01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:57.960
How literate is Mike in terms of animation?

01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:00.660
Like was he able to speak to you in your language or you know what?

01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:07.040
Yeah, that's something that I'm so grateful for in Mike is that he might not understand

01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:11.100
Like animation terminology or

01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:14.800
Just like all like the twelve principles and all this stuff

01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:19.020
But he is such a good and thorough understanding of how fighting games work

01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:26.860
That a lot of times he would help us fix our animations to make them work more like other fighting games. Yeah

01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:31.260
Just send you like animated guests from like fighter generation. Oh my god constantly

01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:33.200
He says, you know

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:39.060
I want it to work like this and it works like this because of this and this it has this many frames in it

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:41.300
You know, this is why it does what it does

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:46.060
And so much of what I learned just came from him telling me

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:51.180
You know, like this is X number of frames and it works because of this reason

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:59.420
And do that in your animation and a lot of times he's fixing the timing on my animations. Like I don't think I

01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:04.700
Could have done any of what I did like without his input. Oh, yeah crazy

01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:10.900
Yeah, I swear to God like the sentence that I hear most often in fighting games is alright

01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:12.900
So here's how they do it in guilty here

01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:22.700
It's funny because I don't know anyone else that could just rattle off exact frame counts of certain moves from some random game

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:27.980
And just you know, it's not even fighting games like he could do that about

01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:30.660
You know Metroid

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:35.460
Any game he's passionate about he will just dissect and

01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:39.260
Know in and out. It's really fascinating to me

01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:44.140
This all lends weight to the claim that even though Mike was the foundation of the whole operation

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:45.860
Especially after the absence of Alex

01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:49.060
He still intended to make lab zero games a worker co-op

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:53.580
Probably because he viewed these people as his friends and he wanted to do right by them

01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:59.620
It just wasn't legally possible Mario's attitude towards her own art has changed over the years in 2012

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:04.900
She said she didn't really think about what she drew or why she simply knew that she liked girls with big boobs and gory horror

01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:10.020
Stuff and mecha fetus was her connection to other Southern California creatives with those same tastes

01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:14.060
Is there any reason why the mecha fetus blog is a little slow with updates?

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:19.500
Where can we get more regular updates on your work? I thought you had your own tumblr as well. Is that right?

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:22.340
Uh, yeah, I do know well

01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:28.700
I think we were almost active on the busy blog while we were in college and since then we've had

01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:33.740
You know jobs and we come home from our work and we're just too tired to try extra stuff

01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:42.060
You know, it's still updated sometimes but definitely not as much as it used to and although Alex wasn't a part of mecha fetus

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:43.460
He shared these interests

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:48.860
Which is why Marielle was drawn into the skull girls project as skull girls also includes a lot of those things though toned down

01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:56.160
Did you come up with any of the more disgusting ideas? No, I didn't actually it's it's all Alex and what's great about him is

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.440
That

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:00.440
Also Alex and I like the same stuff

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:03.320
his stuff isn't quite as is

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:09.600
Like brain exposed gory as I like but he just loves weird monstery

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:15.560
You know gross out stuff. So yeah, no, it's super cool Alex and I think pretty alike

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.480
That's great that you yeah

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:23.280
So many people who who get you in that way and that you have so many fans who get you as well

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:26.960
But when you first signed on to work on the skull girls project full-time

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:31.960
Did you feel like you were taking a professional risk in any way or did it just feel natural and like them?

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:39.320
Um, it pretty much felt like a dream come true. Like what better job could I ask for than to animate cute girls?

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:47.280
Marielle also mentioned that skull girls received a lot of flack back during its release that nowadays sounds very familiar

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:51.520
You know as soon as like our first trailer came out, you know, everyone was like, oh

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:59.100
Pedophile disgusting all-girls game. It's like well one. I don't know where the pedophile comment comes from because they're all girls with big

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:07.800
I guess Miss Fortune's boobs are medium. Yeah that pedophile in the art world

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:10.180
Yeah, I know it's it's stupid because in the end

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:14.840
Not every girl is like a sexy bombshell. I think we're actually pretty varied

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.800
But those are the characters that people remember

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:21.240
Um, but

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:27.120
You know, we we all we got a lot of negative press and stuff in the sexism and all that nonsense

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.540
but I

01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:36.080
Feel like everyone on the team felt that we were really making something good and we were pouring our hearts into it

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:41.360
And we were working your asses off and we just wanted to make the best product we could boy

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:46.960
nothing's really changed has it calling drawings of cute women pedophilic is just as dumb today as it was back then and

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:53.640
Developers fear of being labeled as a sexist has only increased since 2012 but back then Mariel gave the correct answer

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:58.640
I'm finding more and more talking to publishers and developers that it's not that they don't want to add

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:06.960
More women or add more minorities and it's not that they think that minorities and women can't sell

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.960
It's that they're oftentimes afraid that they're going to be called

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:14.040
Sexist or racist right if they depict a woman in the wrong way

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:18.120
Then everyone's gonna call them sexist or if they you know, make a male character

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:24.320
I mean a black character with big lips and an afro then it's gonna be oh, you're you're you're racist when

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:30.440
We'll have big lips and afro. It's uh, it's it's limiting people's fear of racism and sexism

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:35.720
I feel can limit them a lot and you guys didn't have that at all. You just went for it

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.320
yeah, I I mean I

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:45.620
Think the way Alex thinks in creating his characters is he just wants to think you're he just wants to make what he thinks is

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:53.560
Super cool. He's not there's no quota to meet or you know, anything like that. He just wants to make awesome stuff

01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:57.040
But did you ever?

01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:03.080
When people call me racist which happens sometimes I think maybe I'm racist and I just don't know it

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:08.800
Who knows I have to like really scan my brain for racism that might be like planted in there

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:12.480
Did you ever think that maybe you were a sexist pedophile?

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.960
um

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:16.520
I've

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:18.280
Don't want to say I've thought about it

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:26.040
But I mean, you know it all the discussion has has made me question like well is my stuff problematic

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:32.960
Um, and I I think what it comes down to especially with school girls is that I

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:35.920
don't think that anything we've made is

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:42.360
Purely eye candy. I feel like every character is substantial

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:50.080
Like the characters that are super sexy like Sarah Bella and Valentine. It's part of their character like

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.440
Valentine in particular

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:58.540
She knows she's sexy. She flaunts it. It's it's part of her to be that and that's okay

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:03.600
That's I think that's totally fine. It's not wrong for a woman to be sexy

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:08.120
This is the liberal reply the sex-positive anti-piritan reply

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:12.120
I I feel like there's an attitude of like that every woman

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:18.880
Like every female character has to be like a strong independent woman and I think that's great

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:23.880
We do need more characters that are like that, but we also need all types of characters. We need different women

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:28.360
One a woman who is strong a woman who is insecure and weak

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:36.920
As long as I think we get variation like that's what we should be going for. Not every woman should be eye candy

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:41.880
Not every woman necessarily needs to be a super badass either

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:47.660
You know people are different and I think that's what we should be going for in our games

01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:53.740
If only progressive creators knew this nowadays Ray Skywalker or Captain Marvel don't work because they're not real people

01:23:53.740 --> 01:24:01.460
They're just avatars of female empowerment 2012. Mariel understood this but by 2016 Mariel's position on this topic had shifted quite a bit

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:06.620
When I was six, my parents got me a Genesis. Okay, and on the Genesis

01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:10.460
I had Street Fighter 2 and then super came out and that had Kami

01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:16.200
And I was always really bummed that Chinle was the only girl in the original and then so they introduced Kami

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:20.160
But my parents didn't want to buy it from me because I already had the game

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:25.800
So I would rent it from blockbuster over and over and over just to play as Kami

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:31.140
I thought she was super cool. This was when I was you know, like seven

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.920
She just seemed super cool. She seemed super strong. I

01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:44.520
Liked her hair. I liked her moves. Just everything about her was like appealing to me for some reason Tifa was a big one

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.920
Just for some reason I was always

01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:50.340
Attracted to like cool female characters

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:56.760
Which is interesting because I actually started off drawing Sonic, okay

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:03.840
Sonic was my life from six to twelve, but even then

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.880
You know, I always liked drawing

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:12.520
Sally and bunny and just like the females of the Sonic universe

01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:17.680
I started just like getting into manga more and then that kind of like dominated most of my teens

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:22.640
But yeah still like throughout I was always just like attracted to

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.920
girls, yeah, and

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:33.120
I've only actually dated men like been in relationships with men

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:37.040
But I'm still like attracted to girls

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:39.920
it's I

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:42.160
Have like a weird

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:49.960
Relationship with my own sexuality where I've only dated men, but I don't particularly find men attractive

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:58.080
Yeah, it's it's kind of weird to say she is clearly hinting at the same sexual awakening and interest that she mentioned back in 2012

01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:03.880
But the tone of her story has changed in 2012. She was more. I don't know. I just think hot chicks are cool

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:07.320
Look at my artwork. It's got girls at big tits while in 2016

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:12.920
She's more about identifying with her sexuality in what we would call nowadays a quasi political manner

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.680
She also makes the claim that she still likes all the same edgy stuff

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:20.680
But that she purposely tones it down because she knows she has eyes on her now

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:26.520
She knows that she can influence others and that the political environment in 2016 is different than what she grew up with

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.520
I like pretty girls

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:33.720
May or may not know that I'm also into like horror and I like gory stuff and you know all that

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:35.720
So

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:43.160
Like from the very start just being an artist like drawing was the outlet for all those things that I liked sure

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:45.640
and

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:48.600
It was like if someone told me not to draw something

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:51.600
Which you know has happened?

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.960
It's like well, what why wouldn't I this is how I get that stuff out of my head, right?

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:01.040
Like that's not to say that I don't have

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:04.760
Fears about putting certain works online

01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:12.280
Like I've kind of toned down the amount of like gore kind of stuff that I post

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:15.200
Like I don't post that stuff as much

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:21.760
Like I think that's just in part like I'm aware that I have a lot more eyes on my work now, right

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:27.360
You know, my art is the way I want to like express certain things, but I do still have a fear of like

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.360
Oh, is this too much?

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:32.040
Especially now, I think

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:35.160
Like kind of like the culture and environment that we're in

01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:41.480
We're very hyper aware of like the meaning like the implications of the work we put out which is good

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:44.800
but my personal struggle is like

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:52.540
When do I stop putting myself into something and start thinking about you know, what other people are seeing about me

01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:56.620
And that's that's something I still have a hard time with in

01:27:56.900 --> 01:28:01.920
2012 Marielle was asked about the future of her career and the answer she gave was interesting Tim Schafer

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.940
For instance, he's been in the business for so long

01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:09.100
He's built up a huge following you can just go on Kickstarter and be like million dollars, please

01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:14.060
I want to make a game. Do you see yourself maybe in 15 years being like million dollars?

01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:16.320
I want to make brain naked boobs

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:18.520
Testons zombie

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:24.200
Rainbow party game and people giving you I know I'd I'd donate as much as you want for it right now

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:29.600
Do you would you ever see yourself being able to make the kind of games that are as weird as you can possibly get? I?

01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:33.880
Don't know I think it's kind of tricky with I

01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:41.320
feel like with games you have to really be conscious of the player and what the player wants which which

01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:48.920
Isn't necessarily how it should be like I wish it could be as open as making like an independent film is

01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:51.320
I don't think I don't know if I'd be a good game

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.400
Yeah, what makes you say that?

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:57.120
hmm, I don't know because I feel like it's a lot of

01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:04.160
Like thinking about systems and and you know, where's where's the game in the game?

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:08.280
And I'm like, well, I want to make something that's pretty and that doesn't make for a good game

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:12.440
But I kind of look I am interested in it, but I feel like

01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:18.560
There's a lot I still have to learn before I even try tackling it in 2020

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:22.920
Marielle states that she has no time for any of her old projects anymore and that she is getting old

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:29.040
Over the past couple years. I've been working on my personal stuff less and less. I don't have the time anymore

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:35.240
I think I'm getting old is what's happening. But yeah

01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:37.240
You're in charge of things

01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:39.600
Yeah, it's different like when you

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:44.560
You have to do that take up your entire day. Yeah

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:48.880
It's different when you're done with your work for the day that it used to be

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:52.200
This is on some level the natural progression of a successful career

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:55.380
You begin as the plucky energetic creative and as you move up in life

01:29:55.380 --> 01:30:01.720
You lose that energy and end up in a more managerial role and in 2023 when she has to face that question a second time

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:05.120
Where do you see yourself in ten years? Her answer is very different

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:09.220
Where do you see yourself in ten years in the games industry?

01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:13.600
Hmm that's a good question. Um, I

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:17.640
Mean, I would I would love to work on more projects like this

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:23.960
I do enjoy being kind of like in a leadership position, but what I really want to do is

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:25.600
help

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.600
bring up others

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:31.840
And and get them to leadership positions to be able to create their own games

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.240
Like if I do kind of go more to a management kind of position

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:42.240
But but if that gives me an opportunity to kind of help others bring their own ideas to life

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:45.260
Like that's something that I would love to see

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:51.600
So I definitely don't see myself like always doing all the art myself and stuff like that

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:58.080
I really believe in making room for for others to share their art

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:00.200
So

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:01.400
Wherever that takes me

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:07.200
Um, I think that's something that I would I would be excited to see passing the torch to the next generation is fine and necessary

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:12.600
Of course, but there's also at least from how I'm reading this the sense that she's lost what made her her

01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:18.120
Yeah, part of that is just aging. I'm old too. I've probably lost some stuff over the years actually with me

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:24.100
It's more like I've gained but here's what I mean. My core interests and values remain uncompromised even after all these years

01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:30.780
I've explored different ideas different hobbies and interests different politics, but my values have always remained the same

01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:32.840
I'm still the same edgy 2000s era dev

01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:37.020
This isn't stagnation because what I was back then was good and it's still good

01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:41.860
This is the rejection of change for changes sake I feel no need to answer for anything

01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:47.740
I've done in the past because even if it doesn't line up with modern sensibilities, it's still overwhelmingly good in short

01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:48.820
I don't have trolls remorse

01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:55.220
We've just spent like a half-hour watching clips of Mariel describing her career and her art and maybe it was a little bit too much

01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:57.060
But I wanted to paint a complete picture

01:31:57.060 --> 01:32:02.500
What's happened here isn't just that Mariel's matured and her ideas have changed over time though. That's part of it

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:09.540
It's also that like Atrox from earlier Mariel seems to have not trolls remorse, but sexy remorse in 2012

01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:14.140
She was unapologetically sexual open about her attraction to other women proud and direct in

01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:21.020
2016 she claims to still feel that way but was afraid of the current political paradigm canceling her for being misogynistic in

01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:26.220
2023 all traces of that former Mariel is gone and she has become the Puritan the

01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:29.020
Canceller that she once feared and if you want proof of that

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:33.700
All you have to do is go back and see how she shit on Mike her friend for over a decade for the crime of

01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:39.620
Engaging with her on the terms. She established or hell how about this, you know Philia the skullgirls character

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.700
That was the most censored in that 2023 update

01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:48.560
Mariel was the one who did those initial animations in 2010. I think at the start of 2010 I started

01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:54.620
Animating on the skullgirls just you know as one of my spare things

01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:57.140
and

01:32:57.140 --> 01:33:03.900
We we were focusing on Philia who was the first character and we we pretty much almost finished her

01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:04.640
Yes

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:06.640
That character was her baby

01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:11.360
Mariel drew the panty shots that became iconic of the game and his future club creative director

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:13.680
Mariel greenlit the censoring of her own work

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:20.160
There is this narrative among hardcore skullgirls fans and terminally online culture warriors that the skullgirls

01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:27.200
censorship story is one of new progressive corpora types coming in kicking out the original creators who were based and waifu pilled

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:33.860
Updating it for modern sensibilities regardless of the desires those original creators and all the fans who don't like the changes are just racist

01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:35.660
Alt-right fascist gamer Gators

01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:40.580
It's an appealing story because that actually has happened before but it doesn't quite fit this time

01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:45.800
The majority of the original team that worked on skullgirls back in the day are still there at future club

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:51.620
And this is a case of them ruining their own legacy in order to appeal to the new progressive standard that they either feel

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:56.620
Browbeat into adhering to or that they genuinely believe in themselves and I personally think it's the latter

01:33:56.820 --> 01:34:03.700
What's going on with Mariel Cartwright specifically is what I would like to dub Lindsay Ellis syndrome where you fear the puritanical nature

01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:10.220
Of the audience you've cultivated even as you yourself become more and more like them when Mariel stated that she fears her old

01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:15.780
Artwork being used one day to cancel her those words sound like they could have come directly from the nostalgia chicks mouth

01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:16.420
Yeah

01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:24.020
Like I haven't been posting like the weird stuff the weird and gory stuff recently because I've honestly been scared of the backlash

01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:30.820
You know, I've now seen how people will try to dig up stuff about you and post it

01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:32.860
Like, you know, here's something you did in

01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:35.220
2006 let's see it

01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:41.220
Destroy you because you know the same person you're the same person you were in 2006 and it's like it's not the case people are

01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:43.220
changing constantly

01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:44.480
but

01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:51.900
You know because I'm now scared of those kind of people coming up from the fucking depths of hell to destroy me

01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:53.700
I

01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:57.100
Haven't been posting that kind of work in 2012

01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:02.460
She simply wanted to create artwork that was authentically her and to hell with those who didn't approve for political reasons by

01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:06.180
2016 she was afraid of that 2012 attitude coming back to bite her in the ass

01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:10.060
Even as she still ultimately believed in it and by 2023

01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:15.720
She has absolutely morphed into the type of person who would have canceled her past self for saying the word retarded

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:21.440
But other than that I hadn't really done like a full comic by myself other than

01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:25.080
Like retarded

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:30.400
While researching all of this I went to go check out whatever remnants of that mecha fetus thing might still exist online

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:33.080
And I quickly found this page a lost relic in

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:40.080
2009 our art collective mecha fetus put together a little art book that we sold at anime Expo the mecha fetus site is unfortunately down

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:46.280
But some of the artwork now lives on in a PDF you can download for free 18 plus only please features nudity

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:50.280
Gore and some jokes that have not aged. Well, you've been warned. All right

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:56.680
Well, even though it says it's free the button doesn't work unless I put something in so I guess I'll put in one cent

01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:58.980
There's no PayPal. I got I got to use a credit card

01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:07.020
Do I really want to give Mariel my real-life information? Oh god. Well if something weird happens to my credit card

01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:09.900
I guess I know who did it. All right things I do for a video

01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:14.580
Wait a minute. The amount must be 99 cents. You said it was free

01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:19.800
Okay, one dollar Jesus when you guys toss me a $1 super chat at some point

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:21.980
I hate the idea of actually giving her some of my money

01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:27.160
But I guess that means I'm giving her yours instead and here we go. I've got the PDF mecha fetus

01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:33.600
2009 nice girls nice cats. It is a lot of overly sexualized ridiculous drawings

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:36.760
Honestly the kind of stuff that she's still post nowadays on her private accounts

01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:40.560
But I want to see what she's referring to when she says jokes that haven't aged. Well. Oh, yeah

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.080
I definitely got a sense for this

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:50.120
This is a picture of a naked zombie girl getting seppuku and her blood fountaining out onto a mecha fetus a robot fetus

01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:56.000
Well on the other side, there's an angel woman who's squeezing her tits together and spraying milk onto the same fetus

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:01.040
I mean, it's ridiculous and goofy and stupid but definitely not you too safe. Oh, I think I found it

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:02.760
This is a giant

01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:03.500
bloodied

01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:09.860
futanari woman with like a four-foot cock and a whole bunch of women are like climbing on it and dancing around it while it

01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:14.720
Ejaculates a huge rainbow, but also she has a swastika carved into her tits

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:20.440
This is so stupid and ridiculous. It really is funny artwork, but man

01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:23.880
This is not the kind of thing that a 2023 progressive would do

01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:27.640
I'm not bringing this up to cancel Mariel just like I didn't with Atrux earlier

01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:30.680
It's to point out that all of these people have followed a similar path

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.480
Despite all of their claims to be artists who are creating what is authentically them

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:39.400
They nonetheless move and bend with the wind when being edgy and sexual was popular and progressive

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:44.240
They were edgy and sexual when the political paradigm moved on they also moved on but only kinda

01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:49.340
These people will still make and like sexual art on their personal accounts while at the same time

01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:55.480
Chastising you for your own sexual expression because they're progressive and sex-positive while you're a fetishizer and an exploiter

01:37:55.640 --> 01:38:01.920
Once again, we come face to face with safe horny. There's a hard truth here that I've personally had to learn the hard way

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:04.320
I think Mike might be learning it the hard way, too

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:10.840
when you look at Mariel and Alex and all these other people in their Southern California art clique when you look at other similar cliques in

01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:16.360
Twitch streaming or youtubing speedrunning indie game development any sort of creative field that is relatively new

01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:19.460
You can see the beginnings of class divide in those cliques

01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:24.820
I'm not gonna sit here and say that Mariel is the haves and the artist whose stuff never takes off as the have-nots

01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:28.260
Mariel's not a capitalist bourgeois oppressor or any nonsense like that

01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:32.340
But these are all people who know each other they live in one of the most affluent areas of the world

01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:37.900
They have connections. They wear their politics on their sleeve. Their groups are called collectives or cooperatives for a reason

01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:42.100
They want a bit of that commune aesthetic. We are feature club and we are

01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:49.020
cooperatively owned and run game company everyone on the team has equal ownership and

01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:56.180
Voting power and to determine sort of how the studios run and that was really something that was really really important to us and

01:38:56.380 --> 01:39:01.540
Frankly people like you or I were just not part of the club even if we became successful

01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:04.780
I remember talking to I think it was it's a Gundam about this in private

01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:08.140
He's got a really successful channel, but he's still on the outside of the YouTube game

01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:14.820
He's still somebody that the equivalent of Mariel in a lefty youtuber clique would look down on it's true that Mariel got to where she

01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:16.900
Was based off of her own talent and hard work

01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:23.860
She is truly a successful artist, but she's also physically attractive. She has the right politics. She lives in the right place

01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:27.540
She knows the right people if I were an equally skilled artist as her

01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:33.700
I still wouldn't have her career because I'm not her the socialist analysis of the state of affairs would be to consider the system

01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:39.680
Oppressive and work towards its destruction, but I'm not a fucking retard and also I don't want to destroy what they've built for themselves

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:43.760
I don't want to be a part of it. The actual solution is to build your own

01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:46.440
institutions outside of their control in

01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:52.360
Locations that they ignore and with people they've cast out and of course you gate keep it from them

01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:57.880
A lot of the youtubers that I know personally we've all learned this lesson the hard way and I hope Mike is learning it too

01:39:58.320 --> 01:39:59.560
part 6

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:05.760
Future Club in the court documents Mariel and Francesca exclaim that their company doesn't need to be about fighting games anymore

01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:10.280
They can do whatever they want and there are other stories that they want to tell that are slower and more thoughtful

01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:17.560
You know walking simulators, I guess they reiterated the sentiment during a segment in the progressive gaming expo future of play

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:38.440
Mariel mentioned back in 2012 much of a fan of clock tower that she is, you know that SNES horror game

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:41.700
I would really love to work on a survival horror game

01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:48.540
I think it'd be kind of hard because right now my skills are 2d oriented

01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:51.640
and I think

01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:58.040
It's kind of easier to get like a survival horror thing across in a 3d environment though. My favorite

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:05.320
Survival horror game is the first clock tower. Oh, yeah, which which is a 2d, you know point-and-click

01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:07.320
So

01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:09.040
I don't know

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:14.520
But I guess you know that that would be my dream project and I guess it would star a girl

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:19.320
Well in 2023, she's the lead on the clock tower remake. Give us the lowdown

01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:22.000
Why clock tower?

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:28.680
Yeah, so I think something that way forward and limited run have been really interested in doing

01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:31.240
over the past few years is

01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:32.600
kind of

01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:37.520
Finding these hidden gem games that haven't seen Western release

01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:44.880
So I think clock tower fits exactly that criteria where clock tower is a game that has a really

01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:49.480
Great, like dedicated fan base the original Super Nintendo game, which is my favorite

01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:52.920
Never got a Western release or an official translation

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:58.520
So it seemed like the perfect game to kind of reintroduce to people kind of bring back

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:00.720
This brand and

01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:03.800
You know just just share with the world like how great this game is

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:12.120
So it seems like she's successfully managed to make that shift those slower more intimate stories while still doing something her younger self truly

01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:13.680
Desired which is to her credit

01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:16.480
But my analysis of the court documents seems to be correct

01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:21.460
Marielle and Francesca and the rest of the future clubbers just seemed to be over and done with skull girls

01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:25.880
But it's probably the only lifeline they have right now. It's making them some money though

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:31.880
I'd guess less now since the censorship controversy has tanked their public image, but I think they no longer care about the property

01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:37.280
Here's what I think happened on the business side of things when Marielle and Mike gave that indivisible GDC talk

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:42.760
They both described skull girls like it was over. It was a finished project indivisible was their next big thing

01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:49.080
We were kind of coming off of finishing all the skull girls DLC that we did which we also crowdfunded on Indiegogo

01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:52.880
So we would how many characters did we release for skull girls?

01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:00.000
Okay, so so we put out six DLC characters for skull girls

01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:07.720
And and once we finished that, you know

01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:10.840
We started looking ahead and thinking about our next project

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.520
This explains why skull girls was getting little to no updates during this time, by the way

01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:15.680
The team was just done with it

01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:19.760
But after the implosion of lab zero games and the creation of future club

01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:23.720
I think Marielle and Francesca realized just how fucked they were

01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:28.200
The only contract they could secure was with autumn games for more skull girl stuff

01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:32.040
Which is why even as Marielle and Francesca talk a big game about new projects

01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:35.280
The only thing they did for like three years was try to revive skull girls

01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:40.200
The only property of note they can get their hands on if they were going to be able to move on and do those future

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:44.760
Games they need to milk that old skull girls legacy as much as possible to me

01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:47.720
It seems like this is probably what drove the censorship in the first place

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:53.560
They thought it would boost popularity and hopefully sales enough in the short term just to get a few more dollars out of it

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.520
While their real priorities lie elsewhere

01:43:55.520 --> 01:44:01.440
Additionally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention this plus I spent like 12 hours researching it and I got to get something out of

01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:04.280
That time even if it's only one final paragraph at the end of the video

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:07.380
But it seems like future club is actually a real worker co-op

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:11.040
Marielle and Francesca founded it in Colorado as a B corporation

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:15.160
Which is a corporate status that only some states have a public benefit corporation

01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:19.080
Which allows them to pursue profit but not have a strict fiduciary duty to shareholders

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:23.500
They can instead also pursue a declared public good separate from profit

01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:29.880
This basically gave them the legal leeway to be worker owned right from the beginning instead of trying to turn a normal for-profit

01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:37.240
Corporation into a worker co-op future club, Colorado a b-corp shell company owns a separate company future club, California

01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:41.960
Which is a normal corporation, which they all work for however due to the nature of American business law

01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:48.000
The worker co-op status is if I'm reading this gobbledygook right and I might not be at the whim of Marielle and Francesca

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:53.200
Future Club's founding documents outline that all company shares are pegged at a value of one cent

01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:58.540
one share is given to each employee upon the completion of their probationary period and that the company itself has

01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:04.780
1,000 shares the vast majority of which are held by the company and handed out by executives to the employees

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:09.820
Even though everyone has one share Marielle and Francesca control the remaining shares

01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:14.820
So it might be possible for them to pull some legal fuckery if they wanted to and just take over the company

01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:18.500
I don't know though. I'm no expert in law from my layman's perspective

01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:24.740
It does look like future club is at least a real attempt at a worker co-op and that American law might be unsuited for it

01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:30.560
I'm not sure. So that is everything to me. It seems like Marielle Cartwright is a snake

01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:35.100
She's not a fake gamer girl or some new progressive face coming into skull girls to fuck it up

01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:39.420
That part of the fan narrative is incorrect, but that doesn't mean that she's innocent

01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:43.140
For all of Mike's I'm onts faults and there are many of them don't get me wrong

01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:46.700
Marielle seems like a person who corrupted this friend group from the inside out

01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:49.460
She blamed others for actions that she committed herself

01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:54.240
Including workplace sexual harassment and expressed fears that she would eventually be discovered for it

01:45:54.340 --> 01:45:59.340
She genuinely contributed to a wonderful game in skull girls using her own incredible talents

01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:03.740
But she then used that leverage to force everybody else out of the project and kept it for herself

01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:06.820
Only to exploit it to springboard her career in a different direction

01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:10.100
She betrayed her friends people she knew for years in

01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:14.940
Mike's case being extremely close to him for a decade and then in just a matter of weeks

01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:21.100
Pulled a 180 and viewed him as her worst enemy that decade of friendship meant nothing. She had no compassion

01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:26.460
She knew the claims against him were false and she pushed them anyway because she knew it would help her career

01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:31.300
She didn't even really care if he got saddled with all that debt and in the progressive point of view

01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:36.040
At least everything is forgiven because she is a minority woman in game development who is harassed by a white male

01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:42.880
Because he did the same shit to her that she did to him only she is attractive and popular while he is autistic and awkward

01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:49.800
I personally believe that despite Mike's own faults a lot of the flak he receives nowadays is basically just out of spite

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:54.080
Remember modus games the company run by the woman CEO who decided to give Mike another chance

01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:57.240
She said that his work has been truly genius level stuff

01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:02.960
He is an inspired master of his craft, but also that his personal behavior at her company has been perfect

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:09.280
She was not willing to trade genius level work for bad behavior and she hasn't had to Mike's direct supervisor

01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:14.920
Deagle legacy's art director has said the same thing but in that PC gamer article about the game

01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:20.360
They also reached out to future club employees and printed the opinion of an anonymous former co-worker of Mike's

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:26.840
When I heard that modus was going to work with him. I was like that's disgusting. They're disgusting. It's disgusting

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:30.340
They'd work with him because they clearly don't care about female game developers

01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:35.500
The public record was there of his continued harassment of two ex co-workers. We don't know who this is

01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:36.180
It's anonymous

01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:42.860
but they seem to believe that despite Mike's good behavior at modus games his ongoing lawsuit proves that he hasn't truly changed and that if

01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:46.180
Mike were actually remorseful. He wouldn't be fighting back in court

01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:48.460
He would just be accepting whatever legal punishment

01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:53.740
Mariel and Francesca wish to inflict on him having read all the court documents and watched all the interviews

01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:58.540
I personally believe that this anonymous source from future club is probably Mariel herself

01:47:58.580 --> 01:48:04.700
She is the only one of the former staff who exhibited such visceral hatred of Mike and if I were to do some armchair

01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:07.200
Psychologizing I think that by 2023

01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:14.580
She still holds this visceral hatred because she knows she backstabbed a close friend of hers and she needs to justify it to herself

01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:18.180
On the extreme off chance that you're watching this Mariel

01:48:18.180 --> 01:48:21.760
I just want you to know that tiny voice that you can never seem to get rid of completely

01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:26.460
lingering in the back of your mind in the middle of the night telling you that what you did was wrong and you keep

01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:34.640
Bearing it with more and more hatred more justifications new projects new public statements, whatever but it never seems to go away. It's correct

01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:42.200
The skull girls team

01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:48.820
Predicted that the narrative surrounding future club would be that they bullied Mike out of his company that they destroyed an innocent man for simply

01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:55.420
Being kind of weird and that is exactly what the narrative surrounding future club should be. I hope Mike wins in court

01:48:56.500 --> 01:49:02.700
That's it. That's the end of the video guys. Thanks very much for watching if you couldn't tell this was a lot of work

01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:06.920
I hope you enjoyed it Naomi my girlfriend and Dave my editor doing a few

01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:12.120
Jokey voices for some of the characters in this story if you want me to keep using their incredible talents like this

01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:15.360
Let me know in the comments. I guess I just decided to try it on a whim additionally

01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:19.640
Yes, I do know about technicals video. He got it out first and it was a very good video

01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:20.700
It's certainly worth watching

01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:26.180
I went over a few things that he didn't but also he got that exclusive word from Kim McCaskill

01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:27.940
He emailed her and got her comment on the story

01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:30.380
I could have put that in my video, but I didn't want to steal his work

01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:34.900
It just didn't seem right. So you should go and watch his stuff too. Why not? Anyway, I know this took forever

01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:39.320
Thanks for sticking by me. I will see you guys next time. I love you
