00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
Hello, Skullgirls discord, I know that you obsessively watch every video about this drama that comes out

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,160
There's always someone who posts it in there. So I know that some of you are gonna be watching this one right now

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,960
I hope you guys specifically stick around to the end of this one. I

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:33,640
Remember skullgirls very well it launched back in 2012 over 10 years ago now and I played a fair bit of it on release

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,720
But like all things you eventually move on

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,660
I haven't touched skullgirls in years and to be honest and I've really intended to go back to it

7
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,740
Even as I heard about the game receiving new updates on the periphery of my attention

8
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,460
It was one of those things where I enjoyed my time with the game

9
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,180
I don't regret the hours I put into it, but I didn't really see a need to go back and play it again

10
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:56,740
It's been a decade. I'm doing other stuff now as simple as that all of that changed when the skullgirls censorship controversy hit

11
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:03,900
The first thing I thought of when I heard the news was censorship for skullgirls a game that is specifically about fan service

12
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,520
Okay. Yeah, I know it wasn't all about fan service

13
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,460
But fan service was certainly one of its primary focuses and now they're censoring it

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,060
Well to dive into this conversation fully let's rewind back to the beginning part one lab zero games

15
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:23,620
The primary artist for skullgirls Alex a had or a hot I'm not sure gave an interview about the game during e3 of 2011

16
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:30,180
He had been doodling rough versions of the main skullgirls characters as far back as the early 2000s while he was still in high school

17
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,340
But the idea of turning them into a fighting game roster emerged while he was attending college

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:40,440
Mike Zimont on the programming side of skullgirls was a few years older during a 2012 panel

19
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,440
He described his own entry into the games industry

20
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,540
His parents bribed him with an Amiga to stop him from trying dangerous stunts on his dirt bike

21
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,720
This got him interested in computers and eventually led to him taking up a tester job the lowest of the possible

22
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,280
Entry points into game development, but it paid off

23
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,400
He worked on Star Wars Battlefront 2 as a programmer the original one

24
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,600
Not that god-awful modern version as well as assisting with Lord of the Rings conquest

25
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,080
He was also a professional fighting game player and evo champion and these two

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:15,280
Intersecting skill sets allowed him to land gigs balancing blaze blue continuum shift and Marvel vs. Capcom 2 by

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,440
2009 Zimont was programming his own fighting engine on the side and a mutual friend introduced some day had the two quickly realized that they

28
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,780
Had artwork and character roster fit well with the engine that Zimont was creating and they decided to work together to make a fighting game

29
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:35,160
They were both fans of Western and Eastern art giving skullgirls its unique half anime half rubber hose animation feel

30
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,800
They also wanted to make a Western take on the Japanese all-girl fan service fighter a la arcana heart

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,080
But they also realized they couldn't do it with just the two of them

32
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,840
Hey had and Zimont shot the idea around to multiple indie developers eventually signing with Reverge labs in 2010

33
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,220
Reverge labs signed a deal with autumn games to publish skullgirls with Konami handling distribution

34
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,240
Skullgirls launched a critical and commercial success in April of 2012. However autumn games had other problems

35
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,560
Allegations of fraud were levied at both autumn games and Konami by City National Bank

36
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:12,560
The two companies secured a 14 million dollar line of credit from the bank to publish and distribute the 2010 game Def Jam

37
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,480
Rapstar and the bank was alleging that the two companies misrepresented their financial status at the time of their deal as a result autumn games went

38
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,640
into belt tightening mode

39
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,440
They couldn't afford to renew the contract with Reverge labs and after time was up

40
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,880
Reverge labs ran out of funding all of their employees were subsequently laid off including the Zimont and a had

41
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:37,400
Wasn't the end for skullgirls though the Reverge labs employees who had worked on skullgirls formed a new company lab zero games with Zimont

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,760
As the new owner autumn games retained the skullgirls IP and hired lab zero games to continue work on skullgirls updates

43
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,280
But still funding was tight

44
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,760
So the team turned to indiegogo now remember this was in February of 2013 while there's still a lot of crowdfunding scams nowadays

45
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,800
People have more or less acclimated to the crowdfunding model back then though

46
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,440
There was a lot more skepticism among the average internet user regarding the validity of crowdfunding a game

47
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,920
but the skullgirls crew managed to pull it off raking in a total of

48
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,960
$830,000 covering the funding for four additional characters and a whole bunch of other goodies including an art book a

49
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,380
soundtrack release and a bunch of alternate voice packs and other small bonuses by November of 2013 autumn games

50
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:23,740
Severed ties with Konami claiming that Konami's lack of response was a major hurdle in the distribution of new content for the game

51
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:31,100
Konami replied by demanding that the Konami published versions of skullgirls on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 storefronts be pulled

52
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:38,500
lab zero games announced that the game would be re-released as skullgirls encore by spring of 2014 with all the current

53
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:46,580
DLC included as baseline and without any Konami involvement the Xbox 360 and steam versions of skullgirls were updated to the skullgirls

54
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:52,740
Encore version but due to technical limitations the ps3 version was pulled from the store and had to be redown loaded as a new game

55
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,380
Sony made the game freely available on ps3 to all previous owners of skullgirls

56
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,320
But unfortunately gamers save data didn't carry over to the new version

57
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:07,100
The game was eventually updated again this time with a skullgirls second encore branding with a new round of characters and updates

58
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,820
Second encore was the baseline version of skullgirls for the ps4 which was released in July of 2015 by April of 2016

59
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,040
The steam version of skullgirls was updated to second encore as well

60
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,480
Meanwhile autumn games had tapped a phone developer hidden variable studios to create the game skullgirls mobile

61
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,800
This wasn't just a phone version of the main skullgirls game

62
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,120
This was a new title set as a prequel to the main story and made only for phones skullgirls mobile released in May of 2017

63
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,000
After a long silence skullgirls a second encore received a Nintendo switch port in October of 2019 the Wii U

64
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,800
Nintendo 3ds and Xbox one were all considered for skullgirls ports

65
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,440
But were ultimately skipped at this point in the story skullgirls is a pretty old game and yet

66
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,520
Updating it and refining it is what lab zero games had to focus the majority of its efforts on

67
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,840
Skullgirls just didn't receive enough

68
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:01,000
Consistent support or continued cash flow to be a game with a life cycle this long and it wasn't just because of Konami's roadblocks

69
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,280
Autumn games was also out of money and couldn't afford to keep funding lab zero games for continued development

70
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:13,540
Skullgirls development only started to make a comeback after autumn games pushed the mobile game out and by then lab zero games

71
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,020
Was already deep into production on their next title

72
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:21,940
Indivisible a hat and zymont had shifted their focus to early indivisible development as far back as 2015

73
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,980
But according to a lab zero games employee on Twitter a had left the company in the middle of indivisible development because he had become

74
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,980
Increasingly hostile difficult to work with and was not able to meet company standards

75
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,380
He later tried to sue the company and walked away with a sizable settlement

76
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,100
So with a head of the pitcher zymont was the remaining member of the original

77
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:45,900
Skullgirls duo and he seemed to want to move on to indivisible development while autumn games was trying to keep the skullgirls raft afloat

78
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,820
Yeah, I know guys

79
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,860
It was a popular game in 2012

80
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,900
But we're at 2020 at this point focusing on new projects is the right choice for the company going forward

81
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,440
The truth is by 2020 nobody's talking about skullgirls anymore

82
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,240
But people would start talking about skullgirls again very soon though not for the reasons

83
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,480
Anybody wanted part two the downfall of Mike Z in June of 2020

84
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,580
Mike zymont was commentating an official skullgirls tournament when he made an I can't breathe joke

85
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,120
This was two weeks after George Floyd's death. Just just listen to this

86
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
She's gonna die, yeah

87
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Would it be fair to say that uh

88
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,320
You can't breathe

89
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,960
All right gelato

90
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,880
You got a chance now

91
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,800
Yeah, that might be one of the most awkward things I've ever heard captured on audio

92
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,200
Zymont apologized in the same day saying that the joke was too soon

93
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,960
He blamed his social awkwardness for not being able to read the room, but the damage was done

94
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,640
He was canceled and we all know how canceling events work

95
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,440
so of course this would be the precise moment that other people jump out of the woodwork to accuse Zymont of of

96
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,800
Whatever really professional twitch streamer and cosplayer bunny a you known for thirst trapping everywhere

97
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,680
She goes in the internet leaked her DMS with Zymont where she thanked him for including

98
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,560
Lesbian BDSM in skullgirls and claims his response to her was creepy bunny

99
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:32,440
I you has her own deep lore most notably being in a high-profile relationship with another thirst trapper that ended very publicly and

100
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,920
Spectacularly with her being slapped with her own set of allegations. That's a different rabbit hole for another day

101
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,560
What's important right now is that at least in my view bunny I you is a snake

102
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,040
She masks her behavior behind a progressive inclusive public persona, which is why I'm not surprised

103
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,080
She was the one to jump on the Mike Z canceled bandwagon first just to be clear

104
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:58,000
She publicly thanked a had for including lesbian BDSM in the game who responded with the ever so slightly flirtatious glad you liked it

105
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,360
Oh, ho ho. This is like a 0.1 on the first scale

106
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:08,280
But she had privately messaged Zymont with the sentiment and characterized his responses as uncomfortable and demeaning. Let's go over their DMS

107
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,160
Thank you for making a video game. Where is there is BDSM Yuri. I'm glad you enjoy it

108
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Yeah question mark seems appropriate

109
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,120
There's a lot less of that type of thing than it was originally because even fewer people would have taken it seriously

110
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:28,160
Otherwise witness filly is unused typo pose, which you can look up online. That's not good middle enough. Let's see who this person is

111
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,760
Oh, I think it's the lady was streaming the game recently. They mistook button Jupiter for visits the Twitter page

112
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,320
Whoa, you actually have a catch light slash. I like that's some serious production values. I have so many questions

113
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,240
I want to ask that. I'm definitely not going to ask. I'm happy SG is fun for you

114
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,040
I joked about sending the thanks for Yuri fan service message on twitch while playing Eliza story

115
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:57,640
I also tweeted to an artist who was completely respectful and normal about it. Here's the link this one. I think it's awesome

116
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:04,280
I understand though. I like DOA a lot, but it gets a lot of negative feedback for being too sexy

117
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,360
I love Philly yellow. Yep. I have played skull goes three times on stream

118
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,440
I really love the style and played Eliza's story today. So that's why I thank you for the your a BDSM

119
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:21,120
Ask away. I'm a fan of the game so far. It's like really cool and fun for sure

120
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,400
Oh, yes

121
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,240
We had to add all the mommy raps to Eliza's getting throne frames and we wouldn't have gotten the right rating

122
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,160
Also some foam in her bath strangely said nothing about her other storyboat art ask the questions. Well

123
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,680
Okay

124
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,720
Are you putting on the high voice like lots of Japanese ladies do what brought you SG?

125
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,680
Anyway, I guess I've embraced the thirst culture. But like isn't this weird. It's definitely not anyone's fancy

126
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,120
I don't know how I feel at your place. Did you start out with that as a name?

127
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,920
I'm genuinely curious. My voice is real. It gets higher pitch when I'm excited though. I'm cursed with it

128
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,840
I get that question a lot. I like fighting games

129
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,680
I've had an interest since I was a kid and I wanted to revisit some for nostalgia

130
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,880
I found skull girls through recommendations from my fans. It doesn't bother me thirst is human nature

131
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:16,760
I started as a grab your style model online and did sexy modeling for maybe three years or so before retiring

132
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,160
I retired a year ago to pursue twitch streaming

133
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:27,320
I'm used to thirst stuff from my job and I'm a huge fan of each artist and the culture so it doesn't really bother me

134
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,800
Well, sorry for ask the dumb comic questions, I know some other ladies like that

135
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,280
I bet it's annoying to get asked to put your parent on the phone

136
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:41,880
I suppose there's definitely helps sub count and probably validation if external validation is necessary. I'm embarrassed enough streaming at all and I dislike

137
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:49,120
People so I feel like quantified speaking here. Hey, I'm sort of curious what your family thinks of it

138
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,560
But that's a dangerously close to the coin. What is your boyfriend think promo of you single?

139
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,480
It's just the world up so unfamiliar with gravia the printing process Oh

140
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:05,640
Google helped you're aware of like the prevalent problems with sexism in the FGC assume. Sorry about that advance

141
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,920
I love the skull girls community in particular is better about it. Anyway, I don't mean to bother you

142
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,560
You're just kind of fascinating and unfamiliar. Well, that's a good weird ending

143
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:20,840
The validation comment was like very uncomfortable and demeaning. Can you imagine this conversation with a man in the FCG?

144
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,240
Hmm I'm sure you get messages from humans with penises asking that kind of stuff pretty regularly

145
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,800
So if you prefer, how about I acknowledge the brain inside the lady?

146
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,200
It takes a lot of skill and kind of get a certain amount of both

147
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:40,680
Integrity and ruthlessness to succeed at pretty much anything. So calculating successful person who owns herself. What's your end goal is streaming sustainable

148
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,120
Do you want to own a tech company or manufacture solar cells or grow cute flowers or what?

149
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,380
I'd like to know what to prepare to invest in his responses are creepy

150
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,800
Demeaning and I really don't think you would talk to a man this way in the initial messages

151
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:02,260
I want comes off as an awkward starstruck nerd bunny replies by blowing up his ego a bit over how much she liked skull girls

152
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,360
Considering that bunny started this conversation with sexual content, you know

153
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,880
The lesbian BDSM thing it makes sense that the conversation might go this way

154
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:16,280
One of the questions I'm on asks her is what it's like to embrace thirst culture and be the object of people's affections

155
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:22,000
Bunny replies honestly saying that this is human nature. She's been a model for years. She's used to thirst stuff from her job

156
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,160
She's a big fan of hentai in the surrounding culture

157
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,320
So this type of conversation doesn't bother her after this as I months questions do become more creepy and more personal

158
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,560
But they also kind of read like an awkward nervous nerd who thinks he's having a sexual

159
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,720
Conversation with a girl way out of his league and you know considering how bunny started the conversation with sex

160
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,960
That is one of the possible directions a reasonable person could believe this is gonna go at this point bunny cuts contact with him

161
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,000
And then blasts him online as a creep

162
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,200
But frankly I can see it from both points of view

163
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,720
Bunny seems like somebody who's had to deal with creeps a lot sexual content is likely pretty normalized to her

164
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,480
So to her this was an innocent conversation not a sexual one

165
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,640
Meanwhile as I'm on seems like an otaku who gets exactly zero play and suddenly this hot chick is sliding into his DMS talking about

166
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,280
How grateful she is for his lesbian bondage content?

167
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,320
I can absolutely see a guy like that spilling his spaghetti

168
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,680
But of course bunny only saw fit to release this during Zaymon being canceled over the George Floyd joke

169
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,120
She dropped the logs along with the following public statement

170
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,240
I will no longer be playing skull girls the creator Mike with incredibly

171
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,160
Disrespectful in DMS and made me very uncomfortable

172
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:36,360
I have shared screenshots of the conversation to others in the FCG and to combo Queens

173
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,980
Combo Queens is a group that tries to get women into the fighting game community

174
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:48,800
affiliated with combo breaker a professional fighting game event that Mike Z used to commentate for as a result of bunny going public with the

175
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:55,280
DMS Richard Thire the general manager of Evo and the event director with combo breaker put out this statement in

176
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,080
In addition to the listed reprimands are relayed in the statement released by multiple skullgirls organizers and community members

177
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:06,240
Mike Z will not be welcome at CB 2021 in addition to well

178
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,960
Uh this account called da purple sharpie who seems to be just a random

179
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:18,580
Individual speaking for the skullgirls community presented a list of demands that the fans want implemented upon Mike Zaymon in

180
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,560
Retaliation for the whole bunny thing. Yeah, I don't know what the fuck this is all about

181
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,360
These people aren't employees of anything they're not from an organization. They're just fans

182
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,920
Alright, let's read it

183
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:35,800
Our goal is to create a gaming space that is welcome for all participants regardless of their race gender blah blah blah

184
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:43,600
We believe Mike Zaymon should no longer be welcome on commentary or participating in events in the skullgirls community as there is no singular

185
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Entity responsible for the skullgirls community for who determines who is allowed on commentary or who determines per event eligibility

186
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,920
We are asking the community to respect and uphold the following actions one

187
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,760
indefinite ban from all commentary to a two-year ban from offline and online

188
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,300
competition until July 30th

189
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:11,080
2022 our decision to enact and recommend these reprimands was based on Mike's history of problematic behavior in public and

190
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,240
Private including the callous. I can't breathe reference while commentating a match and the reveal of additional inappropriate

191
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,120
Interactions with members of the skullgirls community in private we believe these okay, okay, who's who signed this?

192
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,240
There's a couple of tournament organizers couple of pro fighters and the skullgirls discord administrators

193
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:36,560
The discord admins guys the jannies do it for free after this a second cosplayer named carbon gray who has annoyingly changed

194
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,640
Her name to also be bunny since this drop back in 2020 came out with a video making it vague but similar allegations against Zaymon

195
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,800
This is like my 20 billionth take I have not yet read bunnies DMS, I don't know what Mike said to her

196
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,900
I'm sure it was shitty and I know that because Mike's been making weird sexual comments at me in and out of cosplay

197
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,860
Fighting game events for actual years and I've been writing a lot of it off because when I tell people they're just like oh

198
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,540
He's kind of like that. I'm sorry and like yeah

199
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:10,160
He is kind of like that and he's kind of not changing for the past five years y'all and like neither is anyone else in

200
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,720
The fighting game community and I think a lot of it is because when I tell like my male friends or other TOS what's happening

201
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,840
They just kind of don't do anything with that information

202
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:24,200
If you find out that one of your friends is being absolutely weird or creepy to females in the community

203
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,720
You need to call them on it and actually hold them accountable

204
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,340
This is par for the course when someone's canceled it happened with super mega as well

205
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:37,360
There's generally one person with detailed allegations logs or text or whatever and then a few hanger-ons show up later to literally go me

206
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,080
To me too and most of the time they have far less evidence

207
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:46,760
She expanded on her allegations in a series of tweets that basically amounted to Mike said weird sexual shit to me

208
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,620
IRL and we're supposed to just take her at her word for the most part what carbon is describing is actually pretty bad if it

209
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:52,960
happened

210
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,040
This is all he said she said stuff that she's clearly been holding on to and only dropping right now because Mike's going viral

211
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,160
For most of these examples, there's nobody to corroborate carbon story

212
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,160
But in one there actually was another witness who told their version of events

213
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:15,660
Mr. Banana god 7 who said on June 29th 2020 during the bunny a you think that Mike tried to laugh it off and apologized

214
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,980
Carbon agreed at least enough to like the tweets

215
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,360
However, when carbon retells this story two months later in August of 2020

216
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:29,520
She says he could have just apologized two separate people have told me they asked him to apologize to me the apology that banana god 7

217
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,040
Confirmed Mike gave and that carbon agreed with has been completely erased from the narrative now

218
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,360
Maybe you could say that Mike's apology being of the laughing off of variety was not good enough

219
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,680
It wasn't serious or something

220
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:47,220
Maybe that's the case but carbon saying he apologized and I didn't accept it sounds way worse than he didn't apologize

221
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:54,040
Which is in my opinion why the story quietly morphed over time another allegation came from a guy named. Mr

222
00:18:54,040 --> 00:19:00,360
Beezle a former employee at lab zero games. I had to dig this shit up on the wayback machine because he's since nuked all

223
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,340
of his allegations

224
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:07,200
Mr. Beezle claims that Mike Z scapegoated him gaslit him made verbal threats of violence against him

225
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,540
But he saves the worst for last he made a racist remark three times the majority of mr

226
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:19,560
Beezle's thread is focused on the racism and we never actually get any explanation on the threats. They're just forgotten about mr

227
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:27,020
Beezle complained about getting racially profiled as a Latino thug despite describing himself as the stereotypical image of a Latino thug and he called

228
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:32,440
Mike a white man in power who refused to see my reality. This is a really strange allegation, man

229
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,600
Mike looks more like a Middle Easterner than a white guy and zymont is a Jewish last name. Oh, he's a colonizer

230
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,520
I get it now in actuality. This is another he said she said story and even in mr

231
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,080
Beezle's retelling of events Mike doesn't sound like a harasser

232
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,820
He sounds like an idiot who is entirely clueless about the intricacies of politics and systemic racism

233
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,000
And the only thing I can really say to that is boy

234
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I wish that were me all of these other people coming forward with their own Mike Z story

235
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,160
Prompted bunny to publicly declare that she felt like she was doing the right thing

236
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,280
I was extremely anxious even mentioning anything because it could have been way worse

237
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,080
But hearing all the women come forward after my post and bms makes it worth it

238
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:17,040
We need to make the fcg better for women. I am taking the rest of the day to process everything

239
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,640
Thank you

240
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,840
It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows for her though enough people saw through her bullshit that she began to take flack for this obvious

241
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,880
Spin job so much so that she eventually backed down Mike has reached out to me with an apology

242
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,120
I really hope this makes him aware of others who have come out in hindsight

243
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:40,680
I feel like I should have handled this differently and I apologize for that. I will be deleting my tweets moving forward

244
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,400
It was too little too late for Mike's I'm on though in the eyes of the public

245
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,760
He went from being an awkward

246
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:52,460
Flirter to a sex pest to a sexual harasser to a sexual assaulter pretty quick as a result of all of this the board of directors

247
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,440
At lab zero games formally requested that he resigned from his position

248
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,080
However, you have to remember that Simon wasn't just the lead developer at lab zero games

249
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,440
He was also the owner of the company in exchange for his resignation

250
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,680
Simon made demands of the board that one member Brian June described as

251
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,800
Unrealistically high and potentially illegal the board rejected the demands and in response

252
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,520
Simon simply executed his power as owner of the company and dissolved the board

253
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,760
He gave all employees an ultimatum if you got a problem with it leave the company by August 31st

254
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,040
2020 and so they did a bunch of people left lab zero games publishing statements on social media denouncing

255
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:35,080
Simon shortly after all of us autumn games and the skullgirls mobile developer hidden variable studios announced they were severing ties with

256
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,520
Simon and lab zero games

257
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:42,840
They also announced that since autumn games still owns the skullgirls IP they intended to simply continue work on

258
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,800
Skullgirls with the employees that had left lab zero games and without Simon the employees made a new studio called future club and began working

259
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,440
With autumn games to create additional content for skullgirls second encore

260
00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:00,120
Simon dissolved lab zero games shortly afterward which put an early end to updates for indivisible which had just been released

261
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,400
The Simon continued to be active in professional fighting game scene

262
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,920
But he exited the game development industry for a couple of years

263
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,960
He resurfaced in the summer of 2023 as an employee of modus games working on diesel legacy the brazen age

264
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,960
It's a hand-drawn 2d fighting game like skullgirls

265
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:23,100
But the animations a completely different style from a heads work the CEO of modus games Christina seal stated directly that she chose to hire

266
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,180
Simon for the game not solely because of his extensive experience in the industry

267
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,440
But because she believes that he's accepted his guilt and is capable of being reformed

268
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,120
I am one of the few women that are CEO's and making games in its entire

269
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,760
Industry in a couple years since I made that decision to hire Mike

270
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:47,680
I'm one of the two women CEO's that are running publicly listed companies in the whole industry in the world

271
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:54,240
I did not take this decision lightly when I was talking to Mike and went through the process of figuring out where he was

272
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:01,120
At if you want to have an inclusive environment in the world and you want to have diverse viewpoints all of the things we want

273
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,040
diversity equity

274
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:09,300
Inclusion you have to have a path for people to learn and improve you have to create a better

275
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,440
Way for them to show the world that they've changed and decided to do better

276
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,840
and I really got that from Mike I got that he was committed to it and

277
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,400
That he didn't want everything that went down to be the end of his story

278
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,800
He wanted the opportunity to have the redemptive arc that's in so many stories that we all love man

279
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,480
Maybe I've just become too cynical reading communist theory

280
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,240
But this really sounds like Ximont's gone through a struggle session and has come out of it re-educated and de-fanged

281
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,640
You know what? I mean? He made an edgy joke at the wrong time in a just society

282
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,160
That's something that you apologize for and move on from but that's not what happened

283
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:51,660
one George Floyd joke turned into internet outrage which turned into sexual assault allegations because he was a nerd who thought a hot girl was

284
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:55,960
Flirting with him and his DMS were clipped and shipped at the perfect moment during the cancelling

285
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,160
He's not innocent but he's also not guilty of the high crimes

286
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,240
Everyone thinks that he is and seal here coming out and saying oh, he's reformed now

287
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:10,960
I've got him on my leash just seems very strange part 3 the censorship with both Ximont and a hat out of the picture and

288
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,600
Now considered to be problematic elements by the community

289
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,980
It was time for the past of skull girls to be scrubbed clean of any impure elements

290
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:25,480
You know despite being a fan service focus game in June of 2023 skull girls second encore was updated to remove any risque elements

291
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:33,480
This includes removing all panty shots or otherwise sexual shots of the various female characters like torn clothing the BDSM inspired stuff

292
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,480
That bunny I you complimented is gone, too

293
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,660
Removing the Nazi inspired red armbands of the red egrets one of the game's villainous factions

294
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,240
Removing artwork from the game's art book that references either the game's sexuality or the red egrets armbands keep in mind

295
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,360
This is a digital art book for the Indiegogo backer version of the game

296
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,180
If you crowdfunded this game back in the day your art book has been changed

297
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:00,540
Removing the hair comb in Philia's afro animation presumably because it's some sort of black afro stereotype or something

298
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,980
Removing the police brutality scene in big bands story mode

299
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:10,340
Removing sexual jokes like barely legal for reaching an 18 hit combo or peacocks opening reference to hentai

300
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:18,540
Removing the Soviet announcer voice pack. I don't think this is because it made fun of communism

301
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,860
It's way more likely that it's because Mike Ximont voiced it

302
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,900
Oh and just in case you thought you could download old versions of the game to get around this

303
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,580
Yeah

304
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,100
Those don't exist anymore on

305
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:35,940
Steam and modern consoles second encore over wrote the originals years ago remember and on older consoles where the original skull girls is still

306
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,340
The latest version Konami made them impossible to download years ago

307
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,860
But if you had them downloaded you could still play them until recently

308
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,780
They were quietly finally disabled off your system in this update

309
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,580
I even logged into my old Xbox 360 to see for myself and nope

310
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:57,220
Even though the game has been paid for it's gone on my Xbox series X skull girl second encore is available to purchase

311
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,340
No problem. However, I still have the original skull girls registered to the account

312
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,580
And if I go to that page in my game library

313
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:09,060
It simply says not available right now or ever again Microsoft as expected

314
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,060
There was a huge fan backlash

315
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:16,860
Fan service is a core part of skull girls as identity and removing it basically rips out what made skull girls fun

316
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,940
Plus a lot of the stuff that was removed were indie go-go goals

317
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,700
Like if they reached X amount of dollars in crowdfunding

318
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,100
They would add a perk to the game

319
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:29,780
People had met those goals with their own money and now a decade later the content they funded was being axed for political correctness

320
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,900
Fans responded by leaving negative reviews on Steam

321
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,300
Causing the 10 year old game to dip into the mostly negative rating for the first time in its history

322
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:43,500
Of course the new developers at Future Club sensor the negative reviews and the score has mostly recovered by now and to be fair

323
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,260
There were a lot of people who didn't actually play skull girls leaving negative reviews as well

324
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,260
And these guys are clearly jumping on a bandwagon

325
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,580
However, the general consensus among the public is that while censoring a fan service game is kind of lame

326
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:02,340
Specifically censoring the art book to remove guest art and concept art that is no longer in line with the current vision of the game

327
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,520
Is what reveals this whole thing to have an ideological motive?

328
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:11,880
Anybody who's seen an art book for a game before knows that oftentimes the art in the book doesn't make it into the final game

329
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:18,480
It's meant to show off a work in progress to show how the game evolved from the earliest spitballing of ideas to the current release

330
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,840
Censoring the art book is quite literally removing the past and pretending it never happened

331
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,960
Another tiny tidbit that shows their intent is how after all the censorship went through they began calling their current round of updates

332
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,560
Season one like everything done before this moment just didn't happen

333
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:40,920
It's a very creepy year zero type of stuff and then the legendary discord DMS leaked only adding fuel to the fire

334
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,700
Let's read them at rocks chobatsu a lot of the original team went on to do their own thing like richer

335
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,760
Alex a had left but not before making a big stink about it. Mike's I'm aunt needs no explanation

336
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:58,480
I'm sure but Mariel Earl Brady Brian Chris. They're all still here Miyazaki the red shinobi. Yeah

337
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,800
It's still a majority of the OGs and I knew you guys are never comfortable with certain stuff in the game

338
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,280
Aatrox lol. I mean I liken it to just housekeeping

339
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,960
Miyazaki and to see so many people say no

340
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,520
This is what drew me in specifically just makes me pity them so much

341
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,800
Aatrox like there's a dirty sock in the corner

342
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,660
That's just been there for years and we only just had time to get it out of the way now

343
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:24,360
2011 was such a different time too. Oh boy a current year reference. Here's the context Miyazaki

344
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:30,160
The red shinobi is the person who took this screenshot and released it to the public since the discord DM window is labeled as sending

345
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,720
Messages to a trucks unless somebody stole Miyazaki's phone and released it or something

346
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,300
We can assume it was him who sent it a quick check online shows that Miyazaki has been a longtime

347
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:45,640
Skullgirls fan having been part of the skullgirls fan website skull heart calm ever since the game launched and posting on the skullgirls

348
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:52,640
Discord as far back as 2015 his pics of account also has a bunch of skullgirls lewd fan art favorited either

349
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:59,120
He genuinely agrees with the current skullgirl censorship as he originally wrote in the DM making him kind of hypocritical or he struck up

350
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,440
This conversation with one of the developers with the express purpose of making them put their foot in their mouths

351
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,160
I tend to believe it's the latter because this conversation does not make the developers look good and he chose to release it plus

352
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:13,840
I'm currently in the skullgirls discord myself and checking out his profile on old messages

353
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,300
It seems like he's been kicked from the server. It sounds like he was our guy getting us some info

354
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,360
Also, just real quick during my perusal of the skullgirls discord public channels

355
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:29,000
It seems like they purged not only trolls and shit stirrers, but genuine fans who expressed discontentment at the changes

356
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,480
Atrox Chobatsu is one of the current artists working for Future Club on skullgirls

357
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,460
And as far as I can tell he was not a part of the original team back during the Reverge lab days

358
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,820
He's very lefty hailing from Portland. We all know what that place already

359
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,760
He's also the guy who hosts the skullgirls animation streams on Twitch. I watched a bit of them

360
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,600
There's nothing really going on there. In fact, he generally doesn't talk

361
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,200
He actually just types in the chat in between drawing or whatever

362
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,720
He hasn't publicly said anything directly with the controversy but two days after it broke

363
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,080
He posted this on Twitter

364
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,880
Is it considered censorship if I wanted to remove my tattoo of Yuji Naka's face from my left armpit?

365
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,720
I don't know. I'm just not feeling the same reverence I had for the man 20 years ago. It was a different time

366
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,520
I was younger and stupider, but not by much in my opinion

367
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,920
This is a tongue-in-cheek jab at people who were crying censorship over skullgirls

368
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,900
His positions clear the current legal owners of the skullgirls property who are not the original duo who conceived of it anymore

369
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,240
Don't like some parts of the game and they want to update it which yes

370
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:31,160
They have the legal right to do but that also means pissing off everyone who doesn't agree with their new vision and those people

371
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,400
They're not likely to keep supporting you the DMS show that at least

372
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:40,440
Atrox believes rewriting the past and updating it to fit modern progressive sensibilities is a good thing as he seems like the type to

373
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,440
Develop some variant of trolls remorse

374
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,000
He used to make kind of edgy stuff back on Newgrounds and in one of his old

375
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:52,280
Animations from 2012 it cuts away to some real-life pictures of somebody that I assumed to be him since he does talk about himself as being

376
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,480
the artist of the animation

377
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:59,440
He looks like a pretty normal internet nerd from that era and most Millennials cut from this cloth suffer from trolls remorse today

378
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,560
For example, despite his current very progressive sensibilities

379
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:08,520
His personal YouTube channel has a video from 2009 where he's goofing around with his friends and one of them says faggot

380
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,440
You're not the father

381
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,400
The worst words are ones that are not spoken, okay

382
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:39,580
I'm not pointing this out to cancel him even though an edgy joke is literally what got the cancel ball rolling on Mike Simon

383
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:45,060
I'm only pointing out that just like the tattoo allegory implies. This is clearly not something that he'd do nowadays

384
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:50,960
Oh, also, he's out here talking about how problematic skullgirls is while drawing lewd furry artwork

385
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,860
Good job, dude

386
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:58,540
with all of this being understood the current public narrative regarding skullgirls is that the two original creators a hat and

387
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,420
Zymont were slowly weaseled out of their successful

388
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,820
profitable IP their life's work their dream and the current owners being

389
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:12,080
Progressives with no respect for the property its history the original creators vision or frankly what the fans want are now

390
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:18,020
Repurposing skullgirls to suit their needs updating it for modern standards by removing what people love from the game

391
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:24,540
I understand why that's the public narrative considering how often this sort of thing happens nowadays and how it looks from the outside

392
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,860
But it's also not completely accurate. There is more going on here

393
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,340
But in order to understand it

394
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:35,500
We're gonna have to dive into a topic that has until very recently largely flown under the radar

395
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:43,340
Part four the lawsuit while the initial idea for the skullgirls universe might have come from Alex a hat and the game engine from Mike

396
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:47,060
Zymont they aren't the only people who have been attached to the project since the very beginning

397
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:54,500
Marielle Cartwright one of the original animators who was on the skullgirls project from day one of it hitting reverb labs is just as

398
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:59,860
Crucial to the development of the game as the two boys are and she is the central focus of the skullgirls lawsuit

399
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,980
After lab zero games collapsed and Mike Z laid off all remaining staff

400
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,300
Marielle Cartwright got together with the company's financial officer and producer for indivisible

401
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,860
Francesca Esquenazi and in early 2021

402
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:17,540
They fired off a lawsuit against lab zero games and Mike Z for wrongful termination on April 1st, 2021

403
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,060
I bet they thought it was an April Fool's joke

404
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,580
Mike filed a countersuit with Superior Court of the state of California against Marielle and

405
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:29,300
Francesca and against the company that all the lab zero games former employees had founded to continue the skullgirls work

406
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,460
Future Club the court document is

407
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,700
207 pages long and linked in the description if you want to read it for yourself

408
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:42,980
The claims Mike makes within the documents are backed up with dozens upon dozens of pages filled with internal chat logs at lab zero games

409
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,060
Private messages between Mike Marielle and Francesca and public communications that provide additional context

410
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,820
So let's dive in the court docs begin with describing skullgirls and lab zero games

411
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,260
Which we already know about as well as what a slack channel is

412
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:02,100
Presumably because the American court system is full of boomers and then we get to the third section titled my history of autism spectrum disorder

413
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,700
Mike described what he had known all of his life as Mike being Mike an inability to understand social boundaries

414
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,140
Maintain friendships and just generally deal with people properly

415
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:16,660
He confided in Marielle and Francesca whom he described as his close friends and with their encouragement

416
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:21,180
He eventually went to a therapist and got an autism diagnosis in the next section

417
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:25,940
He describes his friendship with Marielle Cartwright in 2010 Marielle was brought on to Reverge labs

418
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:31,500
Specifically to work as an animator for skullgirls under Alex a had who was I think the creative director

419
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,980
She would become the lead animator in 2012

420
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:40,820
Mike and Marielle became close friends talking and going on walks frequently in Marielle's public statement when she left lab zero games

421
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:46,140
She claimed that Mike harassed her at work. There was years of sexual comments uncomfortable jokes unwanted hugs

422
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:53,060
He apparently suggested she helped him masturbate she claimed to talk to him about how uncomfortable she felt in 2017 and in return

423
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,380
He called her a hypocrite

424
00:34:54,380 --> 00:35:01,060
Marielle says that this hypocrisy stemmed from how she dressed in public implying that Mike believed her way of dressing allowed him to sexually

425
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,860
Harass her. However, this isn't the whole story in the court documents

426
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,940
Mike provides tons of slack logs showing on-the-job

427
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:16,100
Conversations as well as Marielle's private messages to him directly where she regularly engaged in conversations with him about sex sexual orientation

428
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,940
urination pornography

429
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,700
prostitution threesomes plastic surgery body image issues and on and on she began these

430
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:31,100
Conversations herself and expected him to participate her behavior led Mike to believe that this type of talk was welcome and ordinary in the course

431
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:37,700
Of their friendship. She also regularly engaged in this type of talk with other co-workers and drew pornographic artwork while on the clock

432
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:44,040
Which she displayed in the office at least that's how Mike characterized these chat logs in the court documents

433
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,600
And you know being somebody who's around their age. I'm a millennial. They're Millennials. We're all in our 30s

434
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:55,400
This is how people of my age group talk when they're friends and not just you know casual work

435
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:03,080
Acquaintances all of these logs read to me like they were actually genuine friends and that whatever banter they have going on is

436
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,560
Clearly welcome and also a two-way street. Also. I'm not getting Naomi to do the voice for this one

437
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,500
I don't think she wants to do a stereotypical Asian accent

438
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,040
I

439
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:21,160
Francesca Esquenazi had a similar friendship with Mike. He met her while she was working at a GameStop in

440
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,800
2005 before either of them had begun their professional careers in

441
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,060
2007 while Mike was working as a programmer at pandemic studios

442
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:32,120
He was able to get her a job as a receptionist this began

443
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,720
Francesca's career working in the paper-pushing side of the games industry in

444
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,160
2016 he brought her into the skullgirls project as a producer

445
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:46,320
Mike and Francesca's friendship was similar to Mike and Mariel's with lewd or inappropriate topics of conversation being a part of the normal course

446
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,620
Of their interactions and again, it wasn't one-sided. They both began these conversations and expected the other to participate

447
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,240
They had been friends for 15 years and Mike describes several personal events that he helped her through weddings

448
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:04,360
Tragedies Mike helped Francesca come to terms with the death of her child the subsequent gender transition of her husband

449
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,080
How her marriage and sex life were affected how menstruation made her feel inadequate?

450
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,840
Mike took up a role of stability in Francesca's personal life

451
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,780
Next up in the court documents is Mike describing in detail the bunny a you canceling event

452
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:21,000
You know, it makes sense that they be in the court docs because it is one of the big events that led to the destruction of

453
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,720
lab zero games

454
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:28,220
But it's still kind of surreal to see internet shit in a court filing Mike confirms that his conversation with bunny a you happened on May

455
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:35,120
13th 2020 when bunny released her version of these DMS after the George Floyd joke in late June of 2020

456
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,480
They showed that she took the screen caps when the DMS were one day old

457
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:46,140
This means that bunny deliberately sat on these DMS until she could release that the most opportune moment for maximum damage to Mike

458
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:52,920
He also revealed that bunny privately apologized to him something that was left out of the original version of events on June 29th

459
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,160
Mike expressed his frustrations to Mariel over the situation

460
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:02,980
Highlighting the obvious double standard when bunny a you makes the conversation about sexuality and skull girls and her own sexually charged career

461
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:09,580
But when Mike engages with the conversation on that level bunny frames it as if he would never talk to a man in the fighting

462
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:16,340
Game community like this in response Mariel said directly to Mike that all men have to deal with the result of what shitty men have

463
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,980
Done but also that she didn't want him to quit lab zero games and that if she had the power to fire him

464
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:26,340
She wouldn't over this the conversations tone seems to imply that Mariel knows Mike is innocent

465
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:32,140
But also that her progressive politics apply a collective male guilt to him that she isn't directly pushing but that he is

466
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,620
Rejecting and she is uncomfortable with that rejection

467
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,920
Meanwhile in a conversation between Francesca and Mariel where Mike isn't present

468
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,520
Francesca directly says that she thinks a bunny a you baited Mike that bunny started the conversation weird that she didn't believe that Mike meant

469
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,980
To demean bunny and that bunny deliberately cut out Mike's apology in order to paint him a certain way

470
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,620
Mariel agreed with Francesca's assessment in the public lab zero slack channel

471
00:38:54,620 --> 00:39:00,400
They reiterated this position saying that Mike was innocent at the same time in a previous slack channel for women only Mariel

472
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:06,520
Francesca and several female employees outline that they've all had experiences with Mike where he's been inappropriate

473
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:11,000
But also that they all know he doesn't do it purposefully. He's been apologetic every time it's happened

474
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,440
He's worked to make up for it and he genuinely tries to be better

475
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,240
But also that his autism makes it hard for him one employee asks

476
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,640
How many fires are we going to have to put out and that if it wasn't for his autism?

477
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,640
This would be a lot more cut and dry

478
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:27,440
This is where the scheme to take control of lab zero games began with Mariel and Francesca

479
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:33,520
Understanding full well that Mike was doing his best with them openly admitting that they truly believed he was but nonetheless

480
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:39,480
Reluctantly deciding that it was time to take control from him. Well, it was reluctant initially by the end of June 29th

481
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,560
They were privately messaging each other discussing removing Mike from his leadership position on June 30th

482
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:51,760
Francesca and Mariel scheduled two team meetings one with Mike present and one without they were scheduled in the company's Google Calendar

483
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,420
We only have Mike's word as to what happened at the one meeting

484
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,140
He claims that the two women encouraged all of the employees to bash him to his face

485
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:03,980
He admits to crying during the meeting and being forced to explain his autism to the entire company

486
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,660
The woman then ended the meeting by claiming it was a waste of time

487
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:10,780
It was at this point that Mike believes Francesca and Mariel had a change of heart

488
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,920
They were no longer

489
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,500
Understanding about his autism or his good faith efforts to fix things they no longer care that he was innocent with regards to bunny

490
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:24,280
Are you and they were beginning to retroactively redefine all of their past interactions as harassment an hour after the meeting Mariel

491
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:30,560
Formed a new slack channel called Z Z Z where everyone but Mike was present with the express purpose of planning to undermine

492
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,800
Mike's ownership of lab zero games one of their plans involved removing Mike from a leadership and

493
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,760
Ownership position and allowing him to stay on as a contractor

494
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:44,040
Francesca pitched the idea of the entire team up and leaving seeing as they still had connections and options

495
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:50,320
Mariel says that she still considers Mike a friend but that he's destroying the team and he has to go they discussed the peril of

496
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,840
Having to explain to the publisher of the next game focus all of this internal turmoil and how it will affect

497
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:01,600
Focuses support and funding of lab zero games and then Mariel says this I oh no, this is manipulative

498
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,400
I wonder if it would go over better if Mike stepped down on his own

499
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,280
It will look bad to focus if Franny and I asked Mike to leave but if Mike steps down it would be better

500
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:15,220
This was the beginning of Mariel's plot to manipulate Mike to voluntarily step down from his own company by intentionally

501
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,840
Misrepresenting the situation to focus as she was afraid of them pulling funding for lab zeros next game

502
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,600
Part of this plot involved absolutely nothing of this going public as Mariel directly stated. Yes. It looks bad

503
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,320
But if we make a public statement that makes us look slightly better

504
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,480
But then lose all of our jobs and close the company

505
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,680
What good will that have done by the end of the day?

506
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,320
Francesca had drafted an email to focus as the launching of their plan and Mariel approved of it

507
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:42,000
They intended to manipulate Mike into stepping down by misrepresenting their upcoming meeting with focus

508
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,920
Specifically the two told Mike that unless he was gone focus was pulling out in a future meeting

509
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,560
Representatives from focus directly denied this to Mike's face

510
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:57,480
In fact, Francesca later admitted that what they had said regarding focus and Mike was not true while she characterized it as a misunderstanding

511
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,640
This statement reads like she got caught and she knows it

512
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:07,480
Mariel had concocted the whole story that focus was pulling out if Mike wasn't gone under the belief that focus would continue to work with

513
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,680
Them if they managed to get rid of Mike themselves the next day July 1st

514
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,240
2020 the group was discussing forming a new company without Mike still using lab zeros official slack

515
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:23,760
They explicitly stated they intended to take over all of lab zeros contracts with Mariel and Francesca at the helm of a new company

516
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,320
Without any of the baggage of lab zero games and none of its debt

517
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:33,060
They were aware that this meant leaving Mike with the responsibility of paying focus back all of the money

518
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:38,280
They provided to fund the next game along with other business debts totaling around one and a half million dollars

519
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,060
They initially didn't seem thrilled at the idea of leaving Mike with all the lab zero debt

520
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:49,280
But as the summer dragged on they warmed up to the idea with Mariel at one point threatening to use the debt as a weapon

521
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:56,300
Against him. It's at this point that as their plans began to develop Mariel and Francesca began to harden against Mike's autism reasoning

522
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,880
Which they had accepted just a few days prior on July 4th 2020

523
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,520
Mariel said I don't buy as excuse of a checklist and never trying to hurt anyone to do anything bad anymore

524
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:10,320
And I don't accept autism as an excuse anymore while Francesca said that though she doesn't think Mike is a monster

525
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,760
She also doesn't feel like she can believe anything

526
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:19,720
he says anymore as an explanation even though Mariel and Francesca had previously stated that they knew Mike didn't harass anybody and

527
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,000
Falsely accusing him of harassment would ruin his life

528
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,560
They had decided to maliciously characterize his conduct as harassment in order to drum up public support for their new company

529
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,480
But specifically in a way that protects them Mariel said we can't acknowledge any lack of knowledge

530
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:39,000
Enabling or wrongdoing because that validates Max's claims and allows him to come after us

531
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,800
The other ones also open us up to Mike coming after us for defamation. The defamation thing is obvious

532
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,160
But who is this max guy?

533
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:52,260
The only person named max who once worked at lab zero games is apparently a person named max gone

534
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:57,800
At least that's his profile over at art station calm under the screen named B's all aka our friend. Mr

535
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,780
Beezwell from earlier the Latino who accused Mike of violent threats

536
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,960
But never actually provide any proof of them in his long thread full of bullshit nonsense

537
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,100
He actually blames Mariel and Francesca for enabling and supporting Mike's mistreatment

538
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,160
This meant that Mariel and Francesca had a tight line to walk

539
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,520
They needed to make the claim that Mike was actually the harasser

540
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:23,720
They previously said that he wasn't while at the same time at not giving any ammo to mr. Beezwell that frames them as harassers themselves

541
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,680
Bitches be calculating by July 16th

542
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:33,720
Mariel began characterizing Mike as the aggressor and reframing all of their past actions within an abuser victim dynamic

543
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:40,440
By August 6th Mariel seemed to simply view Mike as an enemy saying I don't even want to like get him back or ruin of

544
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:46,600
Her anything just leave please just leave forever the plan for everybody to abandon lab zero games was underway

545
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:53,800
Employees were waiting for a specific time that time came and on August 24th 2020 the implosion of lab zero games was underway

546
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,140
Employees announced the resignation in unison including Mariel

547
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:04,220
Francesca due to her access to the company's financial information knew that quitting at this specific time would maximize damage to the company

548
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:10,320
It was just before payroll was going out for the next month and the conspirators had managed to convince focus not to pay them their

549
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:17,160
Next reimbursement with no money coming in and no staff to perform any work lab zero games was forced to shutter its doors and lay

550
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:24,020
Off any remaining employees including Francesca by September 6th 2020 Kim McCaskill a woman who works in the games

551
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,880
Industry and who is well known for her strong public stance against the sexual harassment of women in game development

552
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,760
Privately spoke to all parties involved and discovered that none of them even mentioned harassment at Simon's hands at all

553
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,600
In fact the whole thing appeared like they were using the sexual

554
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:45,000
Harassment claim to drag Simon through the mud in retaliation for him not following through on making lab zero games a worker cooperative

555
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,120
Apparently due to the negative experience

556
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:53,880
everybody had working at Reverge labs the long term plan for lab zero games after Mike Z took over was that he would turn it

557
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,420
Into a worker cooperative a business model where all workers have an equal share of company ownership

558
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,760
However, there were two reasons as to why this wasn't possible

559
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:09,580
Firstly it turns out that lab zeros corporate lawyer went over the options with Mike Mariel and Francesca and told them that giving the employees

560
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:15,440
A bunch of stock in the company in order to make it into a worker co-op would massively raise those employees taxes

561
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,600
Which does make sense?

562
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:22,520
They now have a lot more net worth being part owners of a successful company the employees didn't want to pay more taxes

563
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:28,200
Obviously, but Mariel and Francesca interpreted this event as proof that Mike was refusing to fulfill his promise to the team

564
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:34,760
However back on June 29th Mariel admitted outright she understood the reason the company was in a co-op wasn't Mike's fault

565
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,880
He was more than willing. It was a legal problem on June 30th

566
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:43,720
She said that the team should only buy up shares of lab zero games and turn it into a worker co-op that way if Mike

567
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,480
Were gone on July 2nd at Mariel no longer trust him with the shares on July 27th

568
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,880
Mariel says that no one's paying Mike anything for his shares of the company the implication being that they just want it for free

569
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,000
Something that was legally difficult

570
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,720
Secondly all of the new co-owners would be on the hook for lab zeros debt

571
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:06,200
Mariel broke down the details of the 1.5 million dollar business debt in one of the chat logs focus is owed

572
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,440
$775,000 that is their publishers investment into their next game

573
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,440
Which they expect game sales to recoup if the game doesn't come out they're on the hook for the money

574
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:20,440
Arsenal is owed $100,000. That's the company's agent Brandon is owed $40,000

575
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,240
That's the company's lawyer seems like they had some bills that needed paying Alex is owed

576
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,160
$50,000 that's Alex a had settlement that was mentioned earlier and Peter is owed

577
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:38,320
$450,000 who's Peter a PlayStation blog post about skullgirls was credited to Peter Bartholow the CEO of lab zero games a

578
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:44,680
quick internet search reveals that Peter Bartholow began his career as a games journalist writing about video games in newspapers back in

579
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
1994 through industry connections he made in journalism

580
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,000
He landed a job with origin systems working on Ultima games

581
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:56,840
This began his game development career, and he worked at multiple studios before ending up with Reverge labs in 2010

582
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,880
He was one of the people who made the move from Reverge labs to lab zero games

583
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:07,280
Peter being the only member of Reverge labs with any business experience and having any capital became the company's sole owner

584
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:13,880
According to Mike's court documents an unnamed CEO and sole shareholder of lab zero games left the company in

585
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,160
2018 upon which Mike became the new owner this had to have been Peter the timeline matches up

586
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,200
So why was Peter Bartholow owed?

587
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,820
$450,000 was it compensation for his initial seed capital was it a settlement like Alex a had well at one point

588
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,640
Francesca mentions offhandedly when I was getting really sick of all the Peter crap

589
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:35,260
I mentioned I might want to leave and start my own thing the company lawyer

590
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:40,480
Meanwhile in an email mentions what he calls the Peter buyout. This is just speculation on my part

591
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,260
We don't have the whole story

592
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:45,520
But it sounds like the team ended up disliking Peter and at some point in 2018

593
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:50,040
Bought his share of the company in order to be rid of him which the company still owed debt on

594
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,520
Also, it's possible that Alex left around the same time as Peter. Yeah, I'm jumping ahead in the story

595
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,280
There's circumstantial evidence that kind of proves this later in the video

596
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:04,600
Which is interesting because it implies a pattern of people at the bottom of lab zero games purposely pushing out the people at the top

597
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:11,400
Marielle even admits as much on July 1st. I don't think I feel comfortable staying at lab zero if Mike is gone

598
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,280
That's not in defense of Mike

599
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:19,320
But rather what it means for what the studio has become and how that impacts us who remain lab zero has so much baggage

600
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:26,200
We've rightfully hosted all the people we need to but what remains is not the company that was founded initially and we're left with all

601
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:33,160
the stories the hurt the literal lawsuits and settlements and hundreds of thousands of dollars owed to people and on a personal note Tyson

602
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:39,440
Expressed he was nervous for how all this makes me and Franny look as people who weren't at the top that kicked all key members

603
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,520
Out and now lead the company. It's entirely possible that Peter left due to workplace disputes

604
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:50,560
Alex left due to workplace disputes Mike was being pushed out due to workplace disputes while Marielle and

605
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:58,000
Francesca both served to benefit from all the original core players moving on while also being at least part of the reason why they

606
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,720
Moved on but that's just my personal conjecture

607
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,240
Finally on September 23rd one of the employees that left

608
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,540
DM to Mike directly on discord and said that it was actually all about

609
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:13,140
Ownership of company in the end that everyone else was tired of waiting for equity distribution

610
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:20,060
During the public collapse of lab zero games one of the former employees Brian June had been answering questions on Twitter

611
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,160
That's where we got the information about Alex's settlement. For example

612
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:29,180
He also said however that Mike was never intended to be the owner of lab zero games after Peter had been bought out

613
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:32,420
Ownership was transferred to him temporarily for legal safety

614
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:38,000
But everyone had agreed to eventually turn the business into a worker co-op and Mike seemed to be trying to do just that

615
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:43,180
The roadblocks appear to be legal not personal but everybody blamed him and retaliated against him

616
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:49,100
Anyway, when he finally wielded the legal power of ownership that he held against the employees trying to dethrone him

617
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:52,800
They took it as a sign that Mike was never going to play ball and was just stringing them along

618
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:58,300
but Mike wielded that power because he believed he was being set up as a fall guy for all the problems a

619
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:03,220
Belief that the slack messages seemed to corroborate. So since we're pretty deep into the weeds here

620
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:06,060
Let me give you a quick recap of what we discovered from the court documents

621
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:11,760
Reverge labs collapses like a decade ago the core team reforms as lab zero games with Peter as CEO

622
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:20,240
Alex Mike Mariel and anyone else important to skullgirls comes along for the ride over the years a Peter and Alex both leave under weird

623
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:25,540
circumstances what we do know is that the company owes them money and Mariel states that her and

624
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:30,420
Francesca removing them and moving into more of a management role themselves was good and necessary

625
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,260
Skullgirls development winds down and the focus shifts to indivisible

626
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,540
After Peter and Alex are gone Mike owns the company and everyone agrees to turn it into a worker co-op

627
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:44,580
Mike has significant legal troubles trying to do so in June of 2020 several public

628
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:51,180
Controversies go viral all stemming from Mike's autism and social awkwardness each of which he apologizes profusely for on

629
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:59,460
August 24th 2020 a huge swath of lab zero games is staff all resign at the same time having coordinated their responses with

630
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:03,300
Francesca's financial data in order to cause maximum damage to the company

631
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:08,900
Despite the former staffs public statements claiming that they've spent the summer of 2020 engaged in an internal investigation

632
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:16,120
Their private chat logs show that they were already creating plans to either remove Mike from his own company or quit and form a new

633
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:23,080
Company one day after the bunny au thing went viral before anyone even knew the truth of it if they managed to wrestle control

634
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:29,720
Of lab zero games their long-term plan was to keep Mike on as a contractor to wrap up any remaining work on the current projects

635
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,960
Before eventually quietly firing him if not they would all quit in unison

636
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:39,120
Which is what they did and use their knowledge of lab zero games as inner workings to saddle Mike with the business debt

637
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:44,900
Steal and use the skullgirls contract as a quick moneymaker to get on their feet and then move on to different projects

638
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:52,180
They explicitly schemed to use Mike's various viral controversies as a public justification for these actions

639
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,820
The man they were friends with for 10 years in a matter of weeks

640
00:52:55,820 --> 00:53:02,980
They went from being understanding to hating him even as they learned more about his neurodivergency in that same time frame

641
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:03,740
Oh also

642
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:10,580
Maryland Francesca knew they were doing some fucky shit because despite Mike's lawyer telling them they should not delete messages on lab zero games

643
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:13,860
Slack they tried to delete messages on lab zero games as slack

644
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:18,860
With all this shit stacked against them what Mike filed ultimately was a countersuit

645
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:23,140
Remember Maryland Francesca filed against him first for wrongful termination

646
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,780
I guess they saw the fat

647
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:28,900
Paychecks that Alex and Peter were getting and decided to get some of that for themselves on the way out the door

648
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:36,780
Also the chat logs show them shifting from empathetic towards Mike and reluctant to take action against their friend in June 2020 to outright

649
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,700
Hating him by August of 2020

650
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:44,960
It's certainly possible that by January of 2021 when they filed the suit all feelings of friendship were gone

651
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,440
And they simply viewed Mike as a resource to exploit

652
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,320
But I think they overextended their hand on this one

653
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,400
Francesca was laid off because the company could no longer do any work

654
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:59,420
That's not wrongful termination and Mariel didn't quit she resigned but maybe she means the disbanding of the board who knows

655
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:05,180
But what we do know is that Mike only slapped them with all of this shit after they came for him legally

656
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:12,100
Mike countersued Mariel Francesca and Future Club for interfering with lab zero games as contracts and relationships

657
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:17,380
Which had fallen apart due to the two women's plans who are now CEO and creative director of Future Club

658
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:24,500
respectively the damages stem from losing the skullgirls contract the shutdown of the indivisible game including the loss of a contract for an

659
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,180
unannounced but in production

660
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:33,440
Indivisible animated series with NBC as well as an unannounced contract with Arc System Works the creator of guilty gear that Bridget game

661
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:38,640
Lab zero games was going to be collaborating on probably the biggest anime fighting IP in the world

662
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,740
Mariel and Francesca tried to get the countersuit dismissed using anti slap laws

663
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,980
slap stands for strategic lawsuit against public participation and it refers to people using the courts and the threat of

664
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,100
Lawsuit to intimidate those who are exercising their First Amendment rights

665
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:58,120
most of the time anti slap laws come into play when somebody with influence threatens those who are speaking out against them with a

666
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:04,480
Lawsuit in order to stifle their speech and this is what Mariel and Francesca alleged that Mike's detailed countersuit was intended to do

667
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,720
In fact their lawyer compared the situation to Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels

668
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,760
But in March of 2022 the judge disagreed ruling that the countersuit can proceed that this wasn't a free speech issue

669
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,320
But a labor relations issue, but by April of 2023

670
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:25,120
It seems like the anti slap denial had been overturned and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings

671
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:31,800
I'm actually not really sure since this case isn't being talked about anywhere online right now and all the official documents are heavy in legalese

672
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:38,720
but it sounds like where the case is at right now is that the court agrees that Mariel and Francesca's case arises in part from

673
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:45,080
Their public statements relevant to a public issue and therefore Mike's countersuit may be a malicious use of the court against them

674
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:52,140
But only if Mike's own case against them is baseless and the court outlined four of Mike's complaints that he might actually

675
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:57,860
Legally win on on their merits independent of the woman's public speech and so they sent the whole thing back to trial

676
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:03,420
So who knows where this goes the best I can tell is that their day in court has been set for February 6 2024

677
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,020
Man, now this video feels kind of incomplete, doesn't it?

678
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:10,100
I considered waiting to do this until the court date, you know to have a nice little bow to tie in the whole story

679
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,220
But who knows how long the trial might take it might be postponed

680
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:18,540
It might get appealed the Mike's I'm on versus future Club legal battle has already been quietly going on for two years

681
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,620
And it could go on for another two

682
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:23,220
Unfortunately, though that means we're all just sitting here with blue balls

683
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:28,140
But maybe I can offer you something else to tide you over until then part 5

684
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:34,580
Mariel Cartwright of the main woman in this lawsuit Francesca Esquenazi is clearly the more elusive of the two

685
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:40,580
She spoke significantly less in the slack channels than her counterpart and there's not much in the way of public appearances of her out there

686
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,260
I'm personally not surprised

687
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:47,880
Remember she was a GameStop clerk that Mike basically turned into a receptionist and she worked primarily in the

688
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,640
Financial and administrative side of the business but Mariel Cartwright

689
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:55,520
She's an animator by trade and the internet is littered with her various public appearances

690
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,800
A lot of these are simply animation workshops or doing press tours for games

691
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:04,480
But others are personal interviews and in those interviews, she said some very interesting things

692
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:10,480
So let's take a look at who Mariel Cartwright is at least who she appears to be from my point of view

693
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,560
There's a handful of primary sources. I'm going to be jumping between in order to make my point

694
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,760
They're all publicly available on YouTube

695
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,240
So if you think I'm somehow misrepresenting Mariel or I've got something wrong

696
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,920
They are all available for you to watch yourself. The major interviews

697
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,460
I'm going to be talking about are in chronological order one

698
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:32,480
Mariel's first ever on-camera appearance in an interview with Destructoid on December 23rd 2012

699
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:39,280
Two an interview of multiple lab zero games artists for the black torch anthology, which seems to be an art book

700
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,280
They all worked on on May 9th 2013

701
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:49,280
Three a panel on how to animate for video games that Mariel gave at a digital dragons convention on July 1st 2014

702
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:56,160
Four an interview that Mariel gave to the fighting game YouTube channel Pat the flip on February 2nd 2016

703
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:02,800
Five a GDC presentation of indivisible hosted by Mariel and Mike on October 11th 2019

704
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:09,440
Six an interview Mariel and her husband Tyson gave for mega 64 on July 25th 2020

705
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:16,520
And finally seven an interview Mariel gave with the horror game Awards on October 30th 2023, which is just a week ago

706
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,120
There's also a few other clips that I couldn't get an exact date on but they're short ones

707
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:25,180
I'll make sure to display on screen exactly which source I'm pulling the statements from let's get into it

708
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:32,440
Mariel's dad is an animator for Disney and her mother is a Japanese citizen. My dad was a Disney animator for most of my childhood

709
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,320
and my mom is Japanese

710
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,920
So it was just like this this blend of

711
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:45,640
You know Japanese culture Japanese films just you know, everything Japanese

712
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,260
combined with

713
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,260
My dad is a gigantic nerd

714
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,640
So it's Disney animation

715
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,920
He you know, he had the Atari

716
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:01,680
He was doing like a little bit of programming and he would get me into video games and stuff a quick Google search of Disney

717
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:07,220
Animators with the family named Cartwright revealed a Randy Cartwright who had a very prolific career at Disney

718
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:13,100
He was offered a job at a Japanese studio in the 80s where he trained Japanese animators on the general Disney style

719
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:17,040
Mariel grew up as a Sega kid and was in love with Sonic back in the 90s

720
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,680
Sonic

721
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,200
When I was like

722
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:38,600
maybe nine or so, my dad gave me a oh my goddess and

723
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,600
Rama

724
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:45,680
Look that he didn't need anymore. And then from there I started getting into all that kind of stuff

725
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:50,920
She ended up spending a lot of time drawing influenced by both of her parents preferred art styles

726
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,440
Was your father being an animator a burden or a help?

727
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,940
No, it was it was definitely a good thing

728
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,540
I remember

729
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:06,660
You know being very young and being able to go to my dad and ask questions about how you know

730
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,660
how do I draw this or that or

731
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:13,960
And you know, he would he would sometimes help out and be like, you know, ask me questions

732
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,260
like how do I think I would draw this and then he would show me the right way to do it and

733
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:25,540
No, he was he was great Mariel met the mega 64 guys at their first ever panel in 2006

734
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:31,540
She got to know them personally during this event and ended up helping them make a lot of their content mostly behind the scenes

735
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,460
How did me and Mariel meet?

736
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,500
She was at

737
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:39,340
Our first panel. It's so weird

738
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:44,020
Because that we the first panel we ever did

739
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:51,180
was at anime Los Angeles in 2006, that was the first panel we ever did and

740
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:59,180
In that room that audience was maybe 50 to 80 people that was I mean that was it and

741
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:03,540
In yet in that group was more

742
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,540
People that would affect my life than any other

743
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:12,300
Like like I met Mariel and all her friends people other people that I grew to know

744
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,380
other famous artists

745
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,980
That work with her and

746
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:23,200
Worked in the game industry stuff like that. They were in there

747
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:29,940
There there were other girls in there that I that I would later like years later like I dated

748
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:34,700
Like a couple different people who didn't even know each other in that same room

749
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,300
Who just happened to live in you know, Southern California?

750
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:43,260
I guess she would have been 18 at this time way before her professional animation career ever got started

751
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:46,740
You you're I mean, honestly, I think out of all the artists that we work with

752
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:52,660
I think we've been doing that stuff with you the longest I think of anybody I think

753
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:57,820
I was just saying I think it's like 14 or 15 years. I think I started this when I was

754
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:01,380
818 that's crazy

755
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:03,540
And I'm 33

756
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:11,580
Mariel attended the California Institute of the Arts otherwise known as Cal Arts. Well that explains a lot of the story we had like a

757
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:14,140
portfolio

758
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:17,020
Show thing at Cal Arts and I had all my stuff out and

759
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:22,060
normally the companies that come by are like Disney and DreamWorks and

760
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:24,920
You know big film companies like that

761
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:29,780
But who also was there was Matt Bozon at WayForward

762
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,300
Because WayForward is in the same city as Cal Arts

763
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:39,600
And he saw my stuff and I think he he got things going he was you know

764
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,300
He was a fan of my stuff and he got things going for me at WayForward

765
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:47,660
She met Jonathan Kim another Skullgirls artist while at Cal Arts and brought him into the project

766
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:52,540
The two of them as well as other creatives in their friend group ran what they characterized as an art

767
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:58,100
Collective called mecha fetus where they collaborated on various art pieces. Well, I met John

768
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,140
persona in

769
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:01,580
college I

770
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:06,580
Went to Cal Arts for character animation and he was in my year and we became friends super quick

771
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:13,220
And he had the idea with another friend of his to start like an art collaborative

772
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:17,220
group mecha fetus ran from their early college days in

773
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:21,900
2006 up until basically their professional careers took off and they no longer had time to work on it

774
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:25,340
I think people who have followed my work, I guess from the beginning

775
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:30,140
Know my stuff from the mecha fetus visual blog

776
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:34,980
Which was me John Kim persona

777
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:37,660
Paul Robertson

778
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:43,080
Eu03 and Brad Raffi and it was just a place where we

779
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,100
posted

780
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:51,300
Whatever really just it was just a place for us to post our earth that like wasn't deviant art or you know, whatever

781
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:57,340
And I think I don't know how I think it's because Paul already had a bit of a following

782
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:01,320
But people discovered that pretty quick. Yeah

783
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:08,040
And so we had like what what what time period were you doing the mecha fetus stuff mostly it was like

784
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,320
2006 or 7 to

785
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,320
Like it's sex because I don't want to say that

786
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:22,380
It's gone. Sure, or we're not gonna come back to it, but we haven't posted on it

787
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,160
But I mean, yeah, all of y'all are doing other things, right? Right. Yeah

788
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:33,680
The style of mecha fetus was described by Marielle as revolving around blood guts and naked girls your styles

789
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:39,320
are definitely different but there's reoccurring themes amongst all of you that being like

790
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,480
nudity

791
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:46,280
exposed brains and like intestines that are fun you like mix

792
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:54,680
Disgusting and sexy and cute all together. Am I right in thinking that that's kind of a unifying theme between um, I

793
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,000
Think that's that's most of a thing between Paul and I

794
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:03,200
We just like gross and cute things

795
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,640
I've always been like a fan of like horror scary stuff

796
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,440
and

797
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,400
Yeah, I mean that's that's kind of it

798
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,480
I just want to draw stuff that I think is cool

799
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:21,660
Mariel tells the story of how her career got started several times across these various interviews and though the story changes each time

800
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:24,700
It's mostly the same then I had my stuff at the job fair

801
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:28,700
I did not get noticed by anyone except

802
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:35,380
Family guy family guy sent me or requested like a storyboard test for me. All right

803
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,700
And then Matt bows on a way forward noticed my stuff

804
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:42,740
And that's actually kind of how my relationship with way forward started

805
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:48,760
She had done a bit of freelance work in video games here and there making the UI for some Barbie game and most notably making

806
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:54,160
A couple of drawings for the joke ending for Silent Hill shattered memories. My first thing was actually

807
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,960
Silent Hill shattered memories

808
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:04,080
Wow, which completely yeah, it came out of nowhere. Like we were you know, we had done the busy vlog for a couple years

809
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,280
And then I got an email from Tom hill at Konami

810
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,120
Asking if I could

811
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:18,420
You know do the the joke ending the UFO ending for shattered memories and I said, yeah

812
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:26,040
I'd love to but through way forward. She got her first big job in the games industry the Scott Pilgrim game. He

813
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:30,240
Asks what artwork did you work on for the Scott Pilgrim game?

814
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:35,800
Oh, I know I was forgetting something Scott Pilgrim game that you worked on what a what a beautiful piece of work that game is

815
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:43,960
He says the game is awesome in the art style rocks. So what did you do on that game? Um, I was one of the animators

816
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,200
I was actually only freelance on it. I worked off-site

817
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:53,060
But I did all the background and PC characters

818
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,280
and

819
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:00,040
I also did the title screen illustration which eventually was

820
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:04,240
Changed a bit in the final version, but I did the original of that

821
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:04,920
I

822
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:11,280
mentioned earlier in the video that the current fan narrative surrounding skullgirls is that the original creators Alex and Mike the ones who were truly

823
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:16,920
Passionate about skullgirls got screwed out of their own creation by progressives who don't give a shit about the property never worked on it

824
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,840
Never cared about it and now they're just ruining it

825
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,640
But this isn't true

826
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:27,400
Alex was another of Marielle's art friends and he brought her onto the skullgirls project before they pitched the concept to Reverge labs

827
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,400
I was a friend of Alex's and

828
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,800
In 2010, I think at the start of 2010 I started

829
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:39,880
Animating on the skullgirls just you know as one of my spare things

830
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,000
They started pitching it to different companies to see if anyone wanted to

831
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:52,960
Publish like pick up and fully develop skullgirls and I think we pitched it to like Ubisoft and maybe stag or something

832
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,560
and in the end it was

833
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,880
autumn autumn games who picked it up and

834
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:05,220
You know said we want to publish this game and we can fund a team develop it fully full-time

835
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:11,100
In fact Alex and Marielle were working on skullgirls before they even brought Mike on with his engine

836
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:16,660
Skullgirls started as an indie project originally as a pixel animated game in like

837
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,660
2004 ish

838
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:21,580
Alex was just working on it by himself at the time

839
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:28,300
And over the course of a few years and after several iterations it made the transition from being a 2d pixel game

840
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:36,140
To a 2d HD game then we had who is now our lead game designer Mike Z join the project and with him came

841
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:39,060
His own fighting game engine that he made himself

842
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:41,780
He was working on that for a long time before

843
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:49,580
Mike has been very particular about this point saying consistently that he or the rest of the team aren't the creators of skullgirls

844
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:55,540
Alex's at one point when Mike and Marielle were discussing indivisible in 2019 Marielle said this

845
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:58,180
The designer

846
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:00,260
artist on skullgirls Alex Ahad

847
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:04,820
You know was was a big part of it. He was the one that also designed all the monsters

848
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,620
Yeah creator of skullgirls

849
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:11,100
Yeah, so I think I think

850
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:13,380
Now this might just be me reading into it

851
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:17,540
But I feel like the tone of this exchange is Marielle downplaying Alex's involvement

852
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:23,700
Mike correcting the record and defending his friend who had left the company at this point by the way and Mariel quickly agreeing but

853
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,660
Rushing past the point but I could just be reading into it a little bit too much

854
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:32,400
Mariel confirmed that only the core skullgirls people from Reverge labs moved over to lab zero games

855
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:36,460
The skullgirls team has made a new studio called lab zero games

856
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,940
and we as a

857
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:44,540
Smaller more of like the score the core skullgirls team

858
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:50,180
We want to continue working on the game. She would later describe this as eight people in total

859
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:54,640
We have eight people in house we have four artists a programmer a designer

860
01:09:55,260 --> 01:10:02,020
An art production guy and our CEO. Okay, we've got Alex Mike Marielle John Peter the unnamed CEO

861
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:07,100
In fact the way that Marielle describes him here as not a part of the creative process just the CEO

862
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:10,420
It really does sound like he just provided the initial startup capital

863
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:14,660
Like I theorized earlier Marielle describes this arrangement as not really being professional

864
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:17,620
They were just a big group of creative friends who wanted to make games together

865
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:19,980
The skullgirls team is made up of

866
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:26,400
Primarily 2d artists and animators and we worked with what we had as just a small indie team

867
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:30,740
We're just a big group of friends pretty much and in fact all throughout these videos

868
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:36,780
Marielle Alex all the artists that are interviewed they all seem to be part of some larger Southern California art scene

869
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:42,120
I actually forgot to mention in my introduction that I'm also part of a lava punch one and two and the spaceman anthology

870
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:46,380
Which are the previous books that that this group has done before and I've known them since

871
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,700
since my days in bow, which is basically

872
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:53,220
artist group gathering in the Bay Area Bay Area artists unite and

873
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:57,420
I was I had met them through there back in high school

874
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:02,180
So I guess I've known them for many years now speaking of that 2019 indivisible stream

875
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:04,660
There's some very interesting things going on there

876
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:11,500
Mike and Marielle are very clearly comfortable with each other acting like old friends Marielle is in the PR role in this conversation

877
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:19,580
Being diplomatic hitting talking points while Mike is this zany all-over-the-place hyper creative type with no public speaking skills

878
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:25,960
Probably the most blatant example of this dynamic is when Mike talks about why they didn't go with the epic game store for indivisible's release

879
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:28,780
What motivated your decision to sell the game where you do?

880
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:32,380
I mean we're we talk to designers now and developers so often

881
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:37,680
A major point of contention is which store front to put the game on and which service to put it out on and that seems

882
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,680
only likely to grow more

883
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:43,840
Contentious in the years ahead. So tell me how did you think about how to sell this game?

884
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,560
And sort of why did you put it out the way you did?

885
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:50,920
I mean, I guess you're referring to like steam versus epic now is kind of the discussion that we're having right?

886
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:57,560
I mean, I guess I guess for us epic came so late in the game that it just didn't really impact our decision at all

887
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,120
I mean it just

888
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,540
Some part of it was that we already had a steam version that worked right? Yeah

889
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:07,900
Yeah, so it you know

890
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:09,980
Consoles in

891
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:15,740
PC Mac Linux. Yeah was just basically it at the time, you know that we made the decision

892
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:19,680
Steam was the thing and so that's just kind of what we followed through

893
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:22,460
so we haven't been to

894
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:30,740
Know what's watching

895
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:36,300
About the epic store like that they give you information to

896
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,100
Their Chinese owner

897
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:51,380
Because that was a weird thing for a minute I recall sorry it was a weird thing for a minute

898
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:57,060
I have no idea whether it was actually confirmed because we didn't come out on the epic store. So yeah

899
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:59,460
I don't I don't want to I'm not trying to defend the epic store here

900
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:03,480
I'm just trying to make sure our claims do you know we're on a live stream here

901
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:07,040
So we don't we don't have the luxury of an editor. Yeah, so some have said

902
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:16,320
I think the bigger point is just that you know steam was our option when we were deciding and so that's what we just stuck

903
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:20,400
Yeah, but more interesting to me is how Mike and Mariel describe their workplace

904
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,680
How much do you let your staff provide creative input?

905
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,100
How do you organize staff input and how do you keep that input from clashing during production?

906
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,080
I think I think everyone has say

907
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:39,840
Yeah, that was that was exactly what I was gonna say and I'm I do not mean to speak over you sure sure

908
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,840
Well, I was just gonna say everyone

909
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:47,600
We encourage everyone to speak up just because I think a lot of the issues we ran into development

910
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,200
we were able to

911
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:55,280
Kind of like avoid or circumvent because someone spoke up and just just gave us an opinion that we weren't expecting

912
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,520
So we do try to encourage everyone to speak up as much as possible

913
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:04,680
But I think like Mike you and I we're both kind of like the vision holders

914
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,200
so we know that what we want out of the game and

915
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,160
And so, you know, we're always listening to feedback

916
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:18,520
But ultimately once a decision needs to be made it's gonna be made by you or I essentially we are as far as feedback goes

917
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:23,620
Completely flat and I don't want us to change that I've worked at places where it was like

918
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:28,460
You say you would say something about art and the artist would be like, well, you're not an artist

919
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:35,360
Like the artist would come to a designer and be like this parts been really frustrating like in me

920
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:41,140
Just playing it because I'm art in this part and the designer be like, yeah, well, you're not a designer. So shut up get out like

921
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:48,180
That sucks because the feedback that you get that's usually the most useful is from the people that aren't in your discipline

922
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:55,060
Right because they notice things that you are not trained or are trained to not notice anymore and like I

923
01:14:55,700 --> 01:15:01,360
try to listen to absolutely everybody from everywhere at all times and then

924
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:06,500
Like the way that I put it on skull girls was I'll listen to everybody but the decision is mine

925
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:11,980
They both genuinely seem to want a flat hierarchy where everyone has an equal say as team leads

926
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:14,180
They do have to make the final choice that's inevitable

927
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:18,020
But Mike seems genuinely committed to the idea of everyone being equal

928
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:25,300
Elsewhere Mario characterized Mike as essential a talented genius that could do things by memory in a way. She'd never seen before the way

929
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,980
making moves for skull girls works is

930
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:34,800
That the artists kind of like all come together and brainstorm just a bunch of moves that they think would look awesome for the character

931
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,140
to do

932
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:40,700
Just no limits. Just anything just kind of trying to keep in mind like well she needs to punch

933
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:43,140
She needs to kick she needs some supers and you know all that stuff

934
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:50,260
and then we pass that on to Mike Mike see who's the designer of skull girls who is just

935
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:55,620
Like the brain behind everything game play related at our company

936
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:57,960
How literate is Mike in terms of animation?

937
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,660
Like was he able to speak to you in your language or you know what?

938
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:07,040
Yeah, that's something that I'm so grateful for in Mike is that he might not understand

939
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:11,100
Like animation terminology or

940
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:14,800
Just like all like the twelve principles and all this stuff

941
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:19,020
But he is such a good and thorough understanding of how fighting games work

942
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:26,860
That a lot of times he would help us fix our animations to make them work more like other fighting games. Yeah

943
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:31,260
Just send you like animated guests from like fighter generation. Oh my god constantly

944
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:33,200
He says, you know

945
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:39,060
I want it to work like this and it works like this because of this and this it has this many frames in it

946
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:41,300
You know, this is why it does what it does

947
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:46,060
And so much of what I learned just came from him telling me

948
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:51,180
You know, like this is X number of frames and it works because of this reason

949
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:59,420
And do that in your animation and a lot of times he's fixing the timing on my animations. Like I don't think I

950
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:04,700
Could have done any of what I did like without his input. Oh, yeah crazy

951
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:10,900
Yeah, I swear to God like the sentence that I hear most often in fighting games is alright

952
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:12,900
So here's how they do it in guilty here

953
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:22,700
It's funny because I don't know anyone else that could just rattle off exact frame counts of certain moves from some random game

954
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:27,980
And just you know, it's not even fighting games like he could do that about

955
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:30,660
You know Metroid

956
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:35,460
Any game he's passionate about he will just dissect and

957
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:39,260
Know in and out. It's really fascinating to me

958
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:44,140
This all lends weight to the claim that even though Mike was the foundation of the whole operation

959
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:45,860
Especially after the absence of Alex

960
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:49,060
He still intended to make lab zero games a worker co-op

961
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:53,580
Probably because he viewed these people as his friends and he wanted to do right by them

962
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:59,620
It just wasn't legally possible Mario's attitude towards her own art has changed over the years in 2012

963
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:04,900
She said she didn't really think about what she drew or why she simply knew that she liked girls with big boobs and gory horror

964
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:10,020
Stuff and mecha fetus was her connection to other Southern California creatives with those same tastes

965
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:14,060
Is there any reason why the mecha fetus blog is a little slow with updates?

966
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:19,500
Where can we get more regular updates on your work? I thought you had your own tumblr as well. Is that right?

967
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:22,340
Uh, yeah, I do know well

968
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:28,700
I think we were almost active on the busy blog while we were in college and since then we've had

969
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:33,740
You know jobs and we come home from our work and we're just too tired to try extra stuff

970
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:42,060
You know, it's still updated sometimes but definitely not as much as it used to and although Alex wasn't a part of mecha fetus

971
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:43,460
He shared these interests

972
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:48,860
Which is why Marielle was drawn into the skull girls project as skull girls also includes a lot of those things though toned down

973
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:56,160
Did you come up with any of the more disgusting ideas? No, I didn't actually it's it's all Alex and what's great about him is

974
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,440
That

975
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,440
Also Alex and I like the same stuff

976
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,320
his stuff isn't quite as is

977
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:09,600
Like brain exposed gory as I like but he just loves weird monstery

978
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:15,560
You know gross out stuff. So yeah, no, it's super cool Alex and I think pretty alike

979
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,480
That's great that you yeah

980
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:23,280
So many people who who get you in that way and that you have so many fans who get you as well

981
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:26,960
But when you first signed on to work on the skull girls project full-time

982
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:31,960
Did you feel like you were taking a professional risk in any way or did it just feel natural and like them?

983
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:39,320
Um, it pretty much felt like a dream come true. Like what better job could I ask for than to animate cute girls?

984
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:47,280
Marielle also mentioned that skull girls received a lot of flack back during its release that nowadays sounds very familiar

985
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:51,520
You know as soon as like our first trailer came out, you know, everyone was like, oh

986
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:59,100
Pedophile disgusting all-girls game. It's like well one. I don't know where the pedophile comment comes from because they're all girls with big

987
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:07,800
I guess Miss Fortune's boobs are medium. Yeah that pedophile in the art world

988
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,180
Yeah, I know it's it's stupid because in the end

989
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:14,840
Not every girl is like a sexy bombshell. I think we're actually pretty varied

990
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,800
But those are the characters that people remember

991
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,240
Um, but

992
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:27,120
You know, we we all we got a lot of negative press and stuff in the sexism and all that nonsense

993
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,540
but I

994
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:36,080
Feel like everyone on the team felt that we were really making something good and we were pouring our hearts into it

995
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:41,360
And we were working your asses off and we just wanted to make the best product we could boy

996
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:46,960
nothing's really changed has it calling drawings of cute women pedophilic is just as dumb today as it was back then and

997
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:53,640
Developers fear of being labeled as a sexist has only increased since 2012 but back then Mariel gave the correct answer

998
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:58,640
I'm finding more and more talking to publishers and developers that it's not that they don't want to add

999
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:06,960
More women or add more minorities and it's not that they think that minorities and women can't sell

1000
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,960
It's that they're oftentimes afraid that they're going to be called

1001
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:14,040
Sexist or racist right if they depict a woman in the wrong way

1002
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:18,120
Then everyone's gonna call them sexist or if they you know, make a male character

1003
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:24,320
I mean a black character with big lips and an afro then it's gonna be oh, you're you're you're racist when

1004
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:30,440
We'll have big lips and afro. It's uh, it's it's limiting people's fear of racism and sexism

1005
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:35,720
I feel can limit them a lot and you guys didn't have that at all. You just went for it

1006
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,320
yeah, I I mean I

1007
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,620
Think the way Alex thinks in creating his characters is he just wants to think you're he just wants to make what he thinks is

1008
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:53,560
Super cool. He's not there's no quota to meet or you know, anything like that. He just wants to make awesome stuff

1009
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,040
But did you ever?

1010
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:03,080
When people call me racist which happens sometimes I think maybe I'm racist and I just don't know it

1011
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:08,800
Who knows I have to like really scan my brain for racism that might be like planted in there

1012
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:12,480
Did you ever think that maybe you were a sexist pedophile?

1013
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,960
um

1014
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,520
I've

1015
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,280
Don't want to say I've thought about it

1016
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:26,040
But I mean, you know it all the discussion has has made me question like well is my stuff problematic

1017
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:32,960
Um, and I I think what it comes down to especially with school girls is that I

1018
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,920
don't think that anything we've made is

1019
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:42,360
Purely eye candy. I feel like every character is substantial

1020
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:50,080
Like the characters that are super sexy like Sarah Bella and Valentine. It's part of their character like

1021
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,440
Valentine in particular

1022
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:58,540
She knows she's sexy. She flaunts it. It's it's part of her to be that and that's okay

1023
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:03,600
That's I think that's totally fine. It's not wrong for a woman to be sexy

1024
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:08,120
This is the liberal reply the sex-positive anti-piritan reply

1025
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:12,120
I I feel like there's an attitude of like that every woman

1026
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:18,880
Like every female character has to be like a strong independent woman and I think that's great

1027
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,880
We do need more characters that are like that, but we also need all types of characters. We need different women

1028
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:28,360
One a woman who is strong a woman who is insecure and weak

1029
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:36,920
As long as I think we get variation like that's what we should be going for. Not every woman should be eye candy

1030
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:41,880
Not every woman necessarily needs to be a super badass either

1031
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:47,660
You know people are different and I think that's what we should be going for in our games

1032
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:53,740
If only progressive creators knew this nowadays Ray Skywalker or Captain Marvel don't work because they're not real people

1033
01:23:53,740 --> 01:24:01,460
They're just avatars of female empowerment 2012. Mariel understood this but by 2016 Mariel's position on this topic had shifted quite a bit

1034
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:06,620
When I was six, my parents got me a Genesis. Okay, and on the Genesis

1035
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:10,460
I had Street Fighter 2 and then super came out and that had Kami

1036
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:16,200
And I was always really bummed that Chinle was the only girl in the original and then so they introduced Kami

1037
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:20,160
But my parents didn't want to buy it from me because I already had the game

1038
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:25,800
So I would rent it from blockbuster over and over and over just to play as Kami

1039
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:31,140
I thought she was super cool. This was when I was you know, like seven

1040
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:36,920
She just seemed super cool. She seemed super strong. I

1041
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:44,520
Liked her hair. I liked her moves. Just everything about her was like appealing to me for some reason Tifa was a big one

1042
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,920
Just for some reason I was always

1043
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:50,340
Attracted to like cool female characters

1044
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:56,760
Which is interesting because I actually started off drawing Sonic, okay

1045
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:03,840
Sonic was my life from six to twelve, but even then

1046
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,880
You know, I always liked drawing

1047
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:12,520
Sally and bunny and just like the females of the Sonic universe

1048
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:17,680
I started just like getting into manga more and then that kind of like dominated most of my teens

1049
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,640
But yeah still like throughout I was always just like attracted to

1050
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,920
girls, yeah, and

1051
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:33,120
I've only actually dated men like been in relationships with men

1052
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:37,040
But I'm still like attracted to girls

1053
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,920
it's I

1054
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,160
Have like a weird

1055
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:49,960
Relationship with my own sexuality where I've only dated men, but I don't particularly find men attractive

1056
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:58,080
Yeah, it's it's kind of weird to say she is clearly hinting at the same sexual awakening and interest that she mentioned back in 2012

1057
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:03,880
But the tone of her story has changed in 2012. She was more. I don't know. I just think hot chicks are cool

1058
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:07,320
Look at my artwork. It's got girls at big tits while in 2016

1059
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:12,920
She's more about identifying with her sexuality in what we would call nowadays a quasi political manner

1060
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:16,680
She also makes the claim that she still likes all the same edgy stuff

1061
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:20,680
But that she purposely tones it down because she knows she has eyes on her now

1062
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:26,520
She knows that she can influence others and that the political environment in 2016 is different than what she grew up with

1063
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,520
I like pretty girls

1064
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:33,720
May or may not know that I'm also into like horror and I like gory stuff and you know all that

1065
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,720
So

1066
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:43,160
Like from the very start just being an artist like drawing was the outlet for all those things that I liked sure

1067
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,640
and

1068
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:48,600
It was like if someone told me not to draw something

1069
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,600
Which you know has happened?

1070
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:56,960
It's like well, what why wouldn't I this is how I get that stuff out of my head, right?

1071
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,040
Like that's not to say that I don't have

1072
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:04,760
Fears about putting certain works online

1073
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:12,280
Like I've kind of toned down the amount of like gore kind of stuff that I post

1074
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,200
Like I don't post that stuff as much

1075
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:21,760
Like I think that's just in part like I'm aware that I have a lot more eyes on my work now, right

1076
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:27,360
You know, my art is the way I want to like express certain things, but I do still have a fear of like

1077
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,360
Oh, is this too much?

1078
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,040
Especially now, I think

1079
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:35,160
Like kind of like the culture and environment that we're in

1080
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:41,480
We're very hyper aware of like the meaning like the implications of the work we put out which is good

1081
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:44,800
but my personal struggle is like

1082
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:52,540
When do I stop putting myself into something and start thinking about you know, what other people are seeing about me

1083
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:56,620
And that's that's something I still have a hard time with in

1084
01:27:56,900 --> 01:28:01,920
2012 Marielle was asked about the future of her career and the answer she gave was interesting Tim Schafer

1085
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,940
For instance, he's been in the business for so long

1086
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:09,100
He's built up a huge following you can just go on Kickstarter and be like million dollars, please

1087
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:14,060
I want to make a game. Do you see yourself maybe in 15 years being like million dollars?

1088
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:16,320
I want to make brain naked boobs

1089
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:18,520
Testons zombie

1090
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:24,200
Rainbow party game and people giving you I know I'd I'd donate as much as you want for it right now

1091
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:29,600
Do you would you ever see yourself being able to make the kind of games that are as weird as you can possibly get? I?

1092
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,880
Don't know I think it's kind of tricky with I

1093
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:41,320
feel like with games you have to really be conscious of the player and what the player wants which which

1094
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:48,920
Isn't necessarily how it should be like I wish it could be as open as making like an independent film is

1095
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:51,320
I don't think I don't know if I'd be a good game

1096
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,400
Yeah, what makes you say that?

1097
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:57,120
hmm, I don't know because I feel like it's a lot of

1098
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:04,160
Like thinking about systems and and you know, where's where's the game in the game?

1099
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:08,280
And I'm like, well, I want to make something that's pretty and that doesn't make for a good game

1100
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:12,440
But I kind of look I am interested in it, but I feel like

1101
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:18,560
There's a lot I still have to learn before I even try tackling it in 2020

1102
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:22,920
Marielle states that she has no time for any of her old projects anymore and that she is getting old

1103
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:29,040
Over the past couple years. I've been working on my personal stuff less and less. I don't have the time anymore

1104
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:35,240
I think I'm getting old is what's happening. But yeah

1105
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,240
You're in charge of things

1106
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,600
Yeah, it's different like when you

1107
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:44,560
You have to do that take up your entire day. Yeah

1108
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,880
It's different when you're done with your work for the day that it used to be

1109
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:52,200
This is on some level the natural progression of a successful career

1110
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:55,380
You begin as the plucky energetic creative and as you move up in life

1111
01:29:55,380 --> 01:30:01,720
You lose that energy and end up in a more managerial role and in 2023 when she has to face that question a second time

1112
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:05,120
Where do you see yourself in ten years? Her answer is very different

1113
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:09,220
Where do you see yourself in ten years in the games industry?

1114
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,600
Hmm that's a good question. Um, I

1115
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:17,640
Mean, I would I would love to work on more projects like this

1116
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:23,960
I do enjoy being kind of like in a leadership position, but what I really want to do is

1117
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:25,600
help

1118
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,600
bring up others

1119
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,840
And and get them to leadership positions to be able to create their own games

1120
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,240
Like if I do kind of go more to a management kind of position

1121
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:42,240
But but if that gives me an opportunity to kind of help others bring their own ideas to life

1122
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:45,260
Like that's something that I would love to see

1123
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:51,600
So I definitely don't see myself like always doing all the art myself and stuff like that

1124
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:58,080
I really believe in making room for for others to share their art

1125
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:00,200
So

1126
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,400
Wherever that takes me

1127
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:07,200
Um, I think that's something that I would I would be excited to see passing the torch to the next generation is fine and necessary

1128
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:12,600
Of course, but there's also at least from how I'm reading this the sense that she's lost what made her her

1129
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:18,120
Yeah, part of that is just aging. I'm old too. I've probably lost some stuff over the years actually with me

1130
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:24,100
It's more like I've gained but here's what I mean. My core interests and values remain uncompromised even after all these years

1131
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:30,780
I've explored different ideas different hobbies and interests different politics, but my values have always remained the same

1132
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:32,840
I'm still the same edgy 2000s era dev

1133
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:37,020
This isn't stagnation because what I was back then was good and it's still good

1134
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:41,860
This is the rejection of change for changes sake I feel no need to answer for anything

1135
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:47,740
I've done in the past because even if it doesn't line up with modern sensibilities, it's still overwhelmingly good in short

1136
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:48,820
I don't have trolls remorse

1137
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:55,220
We've just spent like a half-hour watching clips of Mariel describing her career and her art and maybe it was a little bit too much

1138
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:57,060
But I wanted to paint a complete picture

1139
01:31:57,060 --> 01:32:02,500
What's happened here isn't just that Mariel's matured and her ideas have changed over time though. That's part of it

1140
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:09,540
It's also that like Atrox from earlier Mariel seems to have not trolls remorse, but sexy remorse in 2012

1141
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:14,140
She was unapologetically sexual open about her attraction to other women proud and direct in

1142
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:21,020
2016 she claims to still feel that way but was afraid of the current political paradigm canceling her for being misogynistic in

1143
01:32:21,740 --> 01:32:26,220
2023 all traces of that former Mariel is gone and she has become the Puritan the

1144
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:29,020
Canceller that she once feared and if you want proof of that

1145
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:33,700
All you have to do is go back and see how she shit on Mike her friend for over a decade for the crime of

1146
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:39,620
Engaging with her on the terms. She established or hell how about this, you know Philia the skullgirls character

1147
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:41,700
That was the most censored in that 2023 update

1148
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:48,560
Mariel was the one who did those initial animations in 2010. I think at the start of 2010 I started

1149
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:54,620
Animating on the skullgirls just you know as one of my spare things

1150
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:57,140
and

1151
01:32:57,140 --> 01:33:03,900
We we were focusing on Philia who was the first character and we we pretty much almost finished her

1152
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:04,640
Yes

1153
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,640
That character was her baby

1154
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:11,360
Mariel drew the panty shots that became iconic of the game and his future club creative director

1155
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:13,680
Mariel greenlit the censoring of her own work

1156
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:20,160
There is this narrative among hardcore skullgirls fans and terminally online culture warriors that the skullgirls

1157
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:27,200
censorship story is one of new progressive corpora types coming in kicking out the original creators who were based and waifu pilled

1158
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:33,860
Updating it for modern sensibilities regardless of the desires those original creators and all the fans who don't like the changes are just racist

1159
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:35,660
Alt-right fascist gamer Gators

1160
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:40,580
It's an appealing story because that actually has happened before but it doesn't quite fit this time

1161
01:33:40,580 --> 01:33:45,800
The majority of the original team that worked on skullgirls back in the day are still there at future club

1162
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:51,620
And this is a case of them ruining their own legacy in order to appeal to the new progressive standard that they either feel

1163
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:56,620
Browbeat into adhering to or that they genuinely believe in themselves and I personally think it's the latter

1164
01:33:56,820 --> 01:34:03,700
What's going on with Mariel Cartwright specifically is what I would like to dub Lindsay Ellis syndrome where you fear the puritanical nature

1165
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:10,220
Of the audience you've cultivated even as you yourself become more and more like them when Mariel stated that she fears her old

1166
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:15,780
Artwork being used one day to cancel her those words sound like they could have come directly from the nostalgia chicks mouth

1167
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:16,420
Yeah

1168
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:24,020
Like I haven't been posting like the weird stuff the weird and gory stuff recently because I've honestly been scared of the backlash

1169
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:30,820
You know, I've now seen how people will try to dig up stuff about you and post it

1170
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:32,860
Like, you know, here's something you did in

1171
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:35,220
2006 let's see it

1172
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:41,220
Destroy you because you know the same person you're the same person you were in 2006 and it's like it's not the case people are

1173
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:43,220
changing constantly

1174
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:44,480
but

1175
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:51,900
You know because I'm now scared of those kind of people coming up from the fucking depths of hell to destroy me

1176
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:53,700
I

1177
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:57,100
Haven't been posting that kind of work in 2012

1178
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:02,460
She simply wanted to create artwork that was authentically her and to hell with those who didn't approve for political reasons by

1179
01:35:02,740 --> 01:35:06,180
2016 she was afraid of that 2012 attitude coming back to bite her in the ass

1180
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:10,060
Even as she still ultimately believed in it and by 2023

1181
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:15,720
She has absolutely morphed into the type of person who would have canceled her past self for saying the word retarded

1182
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:21,440
But other than that I hadn't really done like a full comic by myself other than

1183
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:25,080
Like retarded

1184
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:30,400
While researching all of this I went to go check out whatever remnants of that mecha fetus thing might still exist online

1185
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:33,080
And I quickly found this page a lost relic in

1186
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:40,080
2009 our art collective mecha fetus put together a little art book that we sold at anime Expo the mecha fetus site is unfortunately down

1187
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:46,280
But some of the artwork now lives on in a PDF you can download for free 18 plus only please features nudity

1188
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:50,280
Gore and some jokes that have not aged. Well, you've been warned. All right

1189
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:56,680
Well, even though it says it's free the button doesn't work unless I put something in so I guess I'll put in one cent

1190
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:58,980
There's no PayPal. I got I got to use a credit card

1191
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:07,020
Do I really want to give Mariel my real-life information? Oh god. Well if something weird happens to my credit card

1192
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:09,900
I guess I know who did it. All right things I do for a video

1193
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:14,580
Wait a minute. The amount must be 99 cents. You said it was free

1194
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:19,800
Okay, one dollar Jesus when you guys toss me a $1 super chat at some point

1195
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,980
I hate the idea of actually giving her some of my money

1196
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:27,160
But I guess that means I'm giving her yours instead and here we go. I've got the PDF mecha fetus

1197
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:33,600
2009 nice girls nice cats. It is a lot of overly sexualized ridiculous drawings

1198
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:36,760
Honestly the kind of stuff that she's still post nowadays on her private accounts

1199
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:40,560
But I want to see what she's referring to when she says jokes that haven't aged. Well. Oh, yeah

1200
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,080
I definitely got a sense for this

1201
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:50,120
This is a picture of a naked zombie girl getting seppuku and her blood fountaining out onto a mecha fetus a robot fetus

1202
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:56,000
Well on the other side, there's an angel woman who's squeezing her tits together and spraying milk onto the same fetus

1203
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:01,040
I mean, it's ridiculous and goofy and stupid but definitely not you too safe. Oh, I think I found it

1204
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:02,760
This is a giant

1205
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:03,500
bloodied

1206
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:09,860
futanari woman with like a four-foot cock and a whole bunch of women are like climbing on it and dancing around it while it

1207
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:14,720
Ejaculates a huge rainbow, but also she has a swastika carved into her tits

1208
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:20,440
This is so stupid and ridiculous. It really is funny artwork, but man

1209
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:23,880
This is not the kind of thing that a 2023 progressive would do

1210
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:27,640
I'm not bringing this up to cancel Mariel just like I didn't with Atrux earlier

1211
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:30,680
It's to point out that all of these people have followed a similar path

1212
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,480
Despite all of their claims to be artists who are creating what is authentically them

1213
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:39,400
They nonetheless move and bend with the wind when being edgy and sexual was popular and progressive

1214
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:44,240
They were edgy and sexual when the political paradigm moved on they also moved on but only kinda

1215
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:49,340
These people will still make and like sexual art on their personal accounts while at the same time

1216
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:55,480
Chastising you for your own sexual expression because they're progressive and sex-positive while you're a fetishizer and an exploiter

1217
01:37:55,640 --> 01:38:01,920
Once again, we come face to face with safe horny. There's a hard truth here that I've personally had to learn the hard way

1218
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:04,320
I think Mike might be learning it the hard way, too

1219
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:10,840
when you look at Mariel and Alex and all these other people in their Southern California art clique when you look at other similar cliques in

1220
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:16,360
Twitch streaming or youtubing speedrunning indie game development any sort of creative field that is relatively new

1221
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:19,460
You can see the beginnings of class divide in those cliques

1222
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:24,820
I'm not gonna sit here and say that Mariel is the haves and the artist whose stuff never takes off as the have-nots

1223
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:28,260
Mariel's not a capitalist bourgeois oppressor or any nonsense like that

1224
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:32,340
But these are all people who know each other they live in one of the most affluent areas of the world

1225
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:37,900
They have connections. They wear their politics on their sleeve. Their groups are called collectives or cooperatives for a reason

1226
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:42,100
They want a bit of that commune aesthetic. We are feature club and we are

1227
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:49,020
cooperatively owned and run game company everyone on the team has equal ownership and

1228
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:56,180
Voting power and to determine sort of how the studios run and that was really something that was really really important to us and

1229
01:38:56,380 --> 01:39:01,540
Frankly people like you or I were just not part of the club even if we became successful

1230
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:04,780
I remember talking to I think it was it's a Gundam about this in private

1231
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:08,140
He's got a really successful channel, but he's still on the outside of the YouTube game

1232
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:14,820
He's still somebody that the equivalent of Mariel in a lefty youtuber clique would look down on it's true that Mariel got to where she

1233
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:16,900
Was based off of her own talent and hard work

1234
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:23,860
She is truly a successful artist, but she's also physically attractive. She has the right politics. She lives in the right place

1235
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:27,540
She knows the right people if I were an equally skilled artist as her

1236
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:33,700
I still wouldn't have her career because I'm not her the socialist analysis of the state of affairs would be to consider the system

1237
01:39:33,860 --> 01:39:39,680
Oppressive and work towards its destruction, but I'm not a fucking retard and also I don't want to destroy what they've built for themselves

1238
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:43,760
I don't want to be a part of it. The actual solution is to build your own

1239
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:46,440
institutions outside of their control in

1240
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:52,360
Locations that they ignore and with people they've cast out and of course you gate keep it from them

1241
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:57,880
A lot of the youtubers that I know personally we've all learned this lesson the hard way and I hope Mike is learning it too

1242
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:59,560
part 6

1243
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:05,760
Future Club in the court documents Mariel and Francesca exclaim that their company doesn't need to be about fighting games anymore

1244
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:10,280
They can do whatever they want and there are other stories that they want to tell that are slower and more thoughtful

1245
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:17,560
You know walking simulators, I guess they reiterated the sentiment during a segment in the progressive gaming expo future of play

1246
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:38,440
Mariel mentioned back in 2012 much of a fan of clock tower that she is, you know that SNES horror game

1247
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:41,700
I would really love to work on a survival horror game

1248
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:48,540
I think it'd be kind of hard because right now my skills are 2d oriented

1249
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:51,640
and I think

1250
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:58,040
It's kind of easier to get like a survival horror thing across in a 3d environment though. My favorite

1251
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:05,320
Survival horror game is the first clock tower. Oh, yeah, which which is a 2d, you know point-and-click

1252
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:07,320
So

1253
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:09,040
I don't know

1254
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:14,520
But I guess you know that that would be my dream project and I guess it would star a girl

1255
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:19,320
Well in 2023, she's the lead on the clock tower remake. Give us the lowdown

1256
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:22,000
Why clock tower?

1257
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:28,680
Yeah, so I think something that way forward and limited run have been really interested in doing

1258
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:31,240
over the past few years is

1259
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:32,600
kind of

1260
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:37,520
Finding these hidden gem games that haven't seen Western release

1261
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:44,880
So I think clock tower fits exactly that criteria where clock tower is a game that has a really

1262
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:49,480
Great, like dedicated fan base the original Super Nintendo game, which is my favorite

1263
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,920
Never got a Western release or an official translation

1264
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:58,520
So it seemed like the perfect game to kind of reintroduce to people kind of bring back

1265
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,720
This brand and

1266
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:03,800
You know just just share with the world like how great this game is

1267
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:12,120
So it seems like she's successfully managed to make that shift those slower more intimate stories while still doing something her younger self truly

1268
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:13,680
Desired which is to her credit

1269
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:16,480
But my analysis of the court documents seems to be correct

1270
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:21,460
Marielle and Francesca and the rest of the future clubbers just seemed to be over and done with skull girls

1271
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:25,880
But it's probably the only lifeline they have right now. It's making them some money though

1272
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:31,880
I'd guess less now since the censorship controversy has tanked their public image, but I think they no longer care about the property

1273
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:37,280
Here's what I think happened on the business side of things when Marielle and Mike gave that indivisible GDC talk

1274
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:42,760
They both described skull girls like it was over. It was a finished project indivisible was their next big thing

1275
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:49,080
We were kind of coming off of finishing all the skull girls DLC that we did which we also crowdfunded on Indiegogo

1276
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:52,880
So we would how many characters did we release for skull girls?

1277
01:42:56,400 --> 01:43:00,000
Okay, so so we put out six DLC characters for skull girls

1278
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:07,720
And and once we finished that, you know

1279
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:10,840
We started looking ahead and thinking about our next project

1280
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,520
This explains why skull girls was getting little to no updates during this time, by the way

1281
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:15,680
The team was just done with it

1282
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:19,760
But after the implosion of lab zero games and the creation of future club

1283
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:23,720
I think Marielle and Francesca realized just how fucked they were

1284
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:28,200
The only contract they could secure was with autumn games for more skull girl stuff

1285
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:32,040
Which is why even as Marielle and Francesca talk a big game about new projects

1286
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:35,280
The only thing they did for like three years was try to revive skull girls

1287
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:40,200
The only property of note they can get their hands on if they were going to be able to move on and do those future

1288
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:44,760
Games they need to milk that old skull girls legacy as much as possible to me

1289
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:47,720
It seems like this is probably what drove the censorship in the first place

1290
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:53,560
They thought it would boost popularity and hopefully sales enough in the short term just to get a few more dollars out of it

1291
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:55,520
While their real priorities lie elsewhere

1292
01:43:55,520 --> 01:44:01,440
Additionally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention this plus I spent like 12 hours researching it and I got to get something out of

1293
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:04,280
That time even if it's only one final paragraph at the end of the video

1294
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:07,380
But it seems like future club is actually a real worker co-op

1295
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:11,040
Marielle and Francesca founded it in Colorado as a B corporation

1296
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:15,160
Which is a corporate status that only some states have a public benefit corporation

1297
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:19,080
Which allows them to pursue profit but not have a strict fiduciary duty to shareholders

1298
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:23,500
They can instead also pursue a declared public good separate from profit

1299
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:29,880
This basically gave them the legal leeway to be worker owned right from the beginning instead of trying to turn a normal for-profit

1300
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:37,240
Corporation into a worker co-op future club, Colorado a b-corp shell company owns a separate company future club, California

1301
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:41,960
Which is a normal corporation, which they all work for however due to the nature of American business law

1302
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:48,000
The worker co-op status is if I'm reading this gobbledygook right and I might not be at the whim of Marielle and Francesca

1303
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:53,200
Future Club's founding documents outline that all company shares are pegged at a value of one cent

1304
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:58,540
one share is given to each employee upon the completion of their probationary period and that the company itself has

1305
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:04,780
1,000 shares the vast majority of which are held by the company and handed out by executives to the employees

1306
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:09,820
Even though everyone has one share Marielle and Francesca control the remaining shares

1307
01:45:09,820 --> 01:45:14,820
So it might be possible for them to pull some legal fuckery if they wanted to and just take over the company

1308
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:18,500
I don't know though. I'm no expert in law from my layman's perspective

1309
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:24,740
It does look like future club is at least a real attempt at a worker co-op and that American law might be unsuited for it

1310
01:45:24,740 --> 01:45:30,560
I'm not sure. So that is everything to me. It seems like Marielle Cartwright is a snake

1311
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:35,100
She's not a fake gamer girl or some new progressive face coming into skull girls to fuck it up

1312
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:39,420
That part of the fan narrative is incorrect, but that doesn't mean that she's innocent

1313
01:45:39,660 --> 01:45:43,140
For all of Mike's I'm onts faults and there are many of them don't get me wrong

1314
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:46,700
Marielle seems like a person who corrupted this friend group from the inside out

1315
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:49,460
She blamed others for actions that she committed herself

1316
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:54,240
Including workplace sexual harassment and expressed fears that she would eventually be discovered for it

1317
01:45:54,340 --> 01:45:59,340
She genuinely contributed to a wonderful game in skull girls using her own incredible talents

1318
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:03,740
But she then used that leverage to force everybody else out of the project and kept it for herself

1319
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:06,820
Only to exploit it to springboard her career in a different direction

1320
01:46:07,180 --> 01:46:10,100
She betrayed her friends people she knew for years in

1321
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:14,940
Mike's case being extremely close to him for a decade and then in just a matter of weeks

1322
01:46:15,220 --> 01:46:21,100
Pulled a 180 and viewed him as her worst enemy that decade of friendship meant nothing. She had no compassion

1323
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:26,460
She knew the claims against him were false and she pushed them anyway because she knew it would help her career

1324
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:31,300
She didn't even really care if he got saddled with all that debt and in the progressive point of view

1325
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:36,040
At least everything is forgiven because she is a minority woman in game development who is harassed by a white male

1326
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:42,880
Because he did the same shit to her that she did to him only she is attractive and popular while he is autistic and awkward

1327
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:49,800
I personally believe that despite Mike's own faults a lot of the flak he receives nowadays is basically just out of spite

1328
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:54,080
Remember modus games the company run by the woman CEO who decided to give Mike another chance

1329
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:57,240
She said that his work has been truly genius level stuff

1330
01:46:57,240 --> 01:47:02,960
He is an inspired master of his craft, but also that his personal behavior at her company has been perfect

1331
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:09,280
She was not willing to trade genius level work for bad behavior and she hasn't had to Mike's direct supervisor

1332
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:14,920
Deagle legacy's art director has said the same thing but in that PC gamer article about the game

1333
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:20,360
They also reached out to future club employees and printed the opinion of an anonymous former co-worker of Mike's

1334
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:26,840
When I heard that modus was going to work with him. I was like that's disgusting. They're disgusting. It's disgusting

1335
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:30,340
They'd work with him because they clearly don't care about female game developers

1336
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:35,500
The public record was there of his continued harassment of two ex co-workers. We don't know who this is

1337
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:36,180
It's anonymous

1338
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:42,860
but they seem to believe that despite Mike's good behavior at modus games his ongoing lawsuit proves that he hasn't truly changed and that if

1339
01:47:42,860 --> 01:47:46,180
Mike were actually remorseful. He wouldn't be fighting back in court

1340
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:48,460
He would just be accepting whatever legal punishment

1341
01:47:48,740 --> 01:47:53,740
Mariel and Francesca wish to inflict on him having read all the court documents and watched all the interviews

1342
01:47:53,740 --> 01:47:58,540
I personally believe that this anonymous source from future club is probably Mariel herself

1343
01:47:58,580 --> 01:48:04,700
She is the only one of the former staff who exhibited such visceral hatred of Mike and if I were to do some armchair

1344
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:07,200
Psychologizing I think that by 2023

1345
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:14,580
She still holds this visceral hatred because she knows she backstabbed a close friend of hers and she needs to justify it to herself

1346
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:18,180
On the extreme off chance that you're watching this Mariel

1347
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:21,760
I just want you to know that tiny voice that you can never seem to get rid of completely

1348
01:48:21,860 --> 01:48:26,460
lingering in the back of your mind in the middle of the night telling you that what you did was wrong and you keep

1349
01:48:26,540 --> 01:48:34,640
Bearing it with more and more hatred more justifications new projects new public statements, whatever but it never seems to go away. It's correct

1350
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:42,200
The skull girls team

1351
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:48,820
Predicted that the narrative surrounding future club would be that they bullied Mike out of his company that they destroyed an innocent man for simply

1352
01:48:48,820 --> 01:48:55,420
Being kind of weird and that is exactly what the narrative surrounding future club should be. I hope Mike wins in court

1353
01:48:56,500 --> 01:49:02,700
That's it. That's the end of the video guys. Thanks very much for watching if you couldn't tell this was a lot of work

1354
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:06,920
I hope you enjoyed it Naomi my girlfriend and Dave my editor doing a few

1355
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:12,120
Jokey voices for some of the characters in this story if you want me to keep using their incredible talents like this

1356
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:15,360
Let me know in the comments. I guess I just decided to try it on a whim additionally

1357
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:19,640
Yes, I do know about technicals video. He got it out first and it was a very good video

1358
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:20,700
It's certainly worth watching

1359
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:26,180
I went over a few things that he didn't but also he got that exclusive word from Kim McCaskill

1360
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:27,940
He emailed her and got her comment on the story

1361
01:49:27,940 --> 01:49:30,380
I could have put that in my video, but I didn't want to steal his work

1362
01:49:30,380 --> 01:49:34,900
It just didn't seem right. So you should go and watch his stuff too. Why not? Anyway, I know this took forever

1363
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:39,320
Thanks for sticking by me. I will see you guys next time. I love you
