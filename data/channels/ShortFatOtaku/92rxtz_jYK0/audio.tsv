0	6760	Hello, Skullgirls discord, I know that you obsessively watch every video about this drama that comes out
6760	11160	There's always someone who posts it in there. So I know that some of you are gonna be watching this one right now
11160	14960	I hope you guys specifically stick around to the end of this one. I
14960	33640	Remember skullgirls very well it launched back in 2012 over 10 years ago now and I played a fair bit of it on release
33680	35720	But like all things you eventually move on
35720	39660	I haven't touched skullgirls in years and to be honest and I've really intended to go back to it
39660	43740	Even as I heard about the game receiving new updates on the periphery of my attention
43740	46460	It was one of those things where I enjoyed my time with the game
46460	50180	I don't regret the hours I put into it, but I didn't really see a need to go back and play it again
50180	56740	It's been a decade. I'm doing other stuff now as simple as that all of that changed when the skullgirls censorship controversy hit
56740	63900	The first thing I thought of when I heard the news was censorship for skullgirls a game that is specifically about fan service
64220	66520	Okay. Yeah, I know it wasn't all about fan service
66520	70460	But fan service was certainly one of its primary focuses and now they're censoring it
70500	76060	Well to dive into this conversation fully let's rewind back to the beginning part one lab zero games
76360	83620	The primary artist for skullgirls Alex a had or a hot I'm not sure gave an interview about the game during e3 of 2011
83620	90180	He had been doodling rough versions of the main skullgirls characters as far back as the early 2000s while he was still in high school
90260	94340	But the idea of turning them into a fighting game roster emerged while he was attending college
94700	100440	Mike Zimont on the programming side of skullgirls was a few years older during a 2012 panel
100440	102440	He described his own entry into the games industry
102720	107540	His parents bribed him with an Amiga to stop him from trying dangerous stunts on his dirt bike
107680	112720	This got him interested in computers and eventually led to him taking up a tester job the lowest of the possible
112900	115280	Entry points into game development, but it paid off
115320	119400	He worked on Star Wars Battlefront 2 as a programmer the original one
119400	123600	Not that god-awful modern version as well as assisting with Lord of the Rings conquest
123680	128080	He was also a professional fighting game player and evo champion and these two
128400	135280	Intersecting skill sets allowed him to land gigs balancing blaze blue continuum shift and Marvel vs. Capcom 2 by
135680	142440	2009 Zimont was programming his own fighting engine on the side and a mutual friend introduced some day had the two quickly realized that they
142440	147780	Had artwork and character roster fit well with the engine that Zimont was creating and they decided to work together to make a fighting game
147780	155160	They were both fans of Western and Eastern art giving skullgirls its unique half anime half rubber hose animation feel
155200	160800	They also wanted to make a Western take on the Japanese all-girl fan service fighter a la arcana heart
160800	163080	But they also realized they couldn't do it with just the two of them
163080	168840	Hey had and Zimont shot the idea around to multiple indie developers eventually signing with Reverge labs in 2010
169040	174220	Reverge labs signed a deal with autumn games to publish skullgirls with Konami handling distribution
174640	180240	Skullgirls launched a critical and commercial success in April of 2012. However autumn games had other problems
180760	185560	Allegations of fraud were levied at both autumn games and Konami by City National Bank
185600	192560	The two companies secured a 14 million dollar line of credit from the bank to publish and distribute the 2010 game Def Jam
192840	199480	Rapstar and the bank was alleging that the two companies misrepresented their financial status at the time of their deal as a result autumn games went
199480	200640	into belt tightening mode
200640	204440	They couldn't afford to renew the contract with Reverge labs and after time was up
204480	209880	Reverge labs ran out of funding all of their employees were subsequently laid off including the Zimont and a had
210360	217400	Wasn't the end for skullgirls though the Reverge labs employees who had worked on skullgirls formed a new company lab zero games with Zimont
217400	223760	As the new owner autumn games retained the skullgirls IP and hired lab zero games to continue work on skullgirls updates
223760	225280	But still funding was tight
225280	231760	So the team turned to indiegogo now remember this was in February of 2013 while there's still a lot of crowdfunding scams nowadays
231760	235800	People have more or less acclimated to the crowdfunding model back then though
235800	240440	There was a lot more skepticism among the average internet user regarding the validity of crowdfunding a game
240600	243920	but the skullgirls crew managed to pull it off raking in a total of
245280	250960	$830,000 covering the funding for four additional characters and a whole bunch of other goodies including an art book a
251040	257380	soundtrack release and a bunch of alternate voice packs and other small bonuses by November of 2013 autumn games
257480	263740	Severed ties with Konami claiming that Konami's lack of response was a major hurdle in the distribution of new content for the game
263940	271100	Konami replied by demanding that the Konami published versions of skullgirls on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 storefronts be pulled
271340	278500	lab zero games announced that the game would be re-released as skullgirls encore by spring of 2014 with all the current
278720	286580	DLC included as baseline and without any Konami involvement the Xbox 360 and steam versions of skullgirls were updated to the skullgirls
286780	292740	Encore version but due to technical limitations the ps3 version was pulled from the store and had to be redown loaded as a new game
292900	297380	Sony made the game freely available on ps3 to all previous owners of skullgirls
297380	300320	But unfortunately gamers save data didn't carry over to the new version
300420	307100	The game was eventually updated again this time with a skullgirls second encore branding with a new round of characters and updates
307520	314820	Second encore was the baseline version of skullgirls for the ps4 which was released in July of 2015 by April of 2016
314820	318040	The steam version of skullgirls was updated to second encore as well
318360	324480	Meanwhile autumn games had tapped a phone developer hidden variable studios to create the game skullgirls mobile
324480	326800	This wasn't just a phone version of the main skullgirls game
326800	333120	This was a new title set as a prequel to the main story and made only for phones skullgirls mobile released in May of 2017
333720	340000	After a long silence skullgirls a second encore received a Nintendo switch port in October of 2019 the Wii U
340120	343800	Nintendo 3ds and Xbox one were all considered for skullgirls ports
343800	348440	But were ultimately skipped at this point in the story skullgirls is a pretty old game and yet
348540	352520	Updating it and refining it is what lab zero games had to focus the majority of its efforts on
352960	354840	Skullgirls just didn't receive enough
354840	361000	Consistent support or continued cash flow to be a game with a life cycle this long and it wasn't just because of Konami's roadblocks
361120	366280	Autumn games was also out of money and couldn't afford to keep funding lab zero games for continued development
366680	373540	Skullgirls development only started to make a comeback after autumn games pushed the mobile game out and by then lab zero games
373660	376020	Was already deep into production on their next title
376340	381940	Indivisible a hat and zymont had shifted their focus to early indivisible development as far back as 2015
381940	387980	But according to a lab zero games employee on Twitter a had left the company in the middle of indivisible development because he had become
388100	391980	Increasingly hostile difficult to work with and was not able to meet company standards
391980	395380	He later tried to sue the company and walked away with a sizable settlement
395500	399100	So with a head of the pitcher zymont was the remaining member of the original
399380	405900	Skullgirls duo and he seemed to want to move on to indivisible development while autumn games was trying to keep the skullgirls raft afloat
405900	406820	Yeah, I know guys
406820	408860	It was a popular game in 2012
408860	413900	But we're at 2020 at this point focusing on new projects is the right choice for the company going forward
413900	417440	The truth is by 2020 nobody's talking about skullgirls anymore
417440	422240	But people would start talking about skullgirls again very soon though not for the reasons
422240	427480	Anybody wanted part two the downfall of Mike Z in June of 2020
427480	432580	Mike zymont was commentating an official skullgirls tournament when he made an I can't breathe joke
432720	437120	This was two weeks after George Floyd's death. Just just listen to this
439440	441440	She's gonna die, yeah
447480	449480	Would it be fair to say that uh
450320	452320	You can't breathe
466120	467960	All right gelato
467960	469880	You got a chance now
469880	473800	Yeah, that might be one of the most awkward things I've ever heard captured on audio
474240	477200	Zymont apologized in the same day saying that the joke was too soon
477200	481960	He blamed his social awkwardness for not being able to read the room, but the damage was done
481960	484640	He was canceled and we all know how canceling events work
484640	489440	so of course this would be the precise moment that other people jump out of the woodwork to accuse Zymont of of
489720	495800	Whatever really professional twitch streamer and cosplayer bunny a you known for thirst trapping everywhere
495800	499680	She goes in the internet leaked her DMS with Zymont where she thanked him for including
499920	504560	Lesbian BDSM in skullgirls and claims his response to her was creepy bunny
504560	512440	I you has her own deep lore most notably being in a high-profile relationship with another thirst trapper that ended very publicly and
513040	517920	Spectacularly with her being slapped with her own set of allegations. That's a different rabbit hole for another day
517920	521560	What's important right now is that at least in my view bunny I you is a snake
521560	527040	She masks her behavior behind a progressive inclusive public persona, which is why I'm not surprised
527040	531080	She was the one to jump on the Mike Z canceled bandwagon first just to be clear
531080	538000	She publicly thanked a had for including lesbian BDSM in the game who responded with the ever so slightly flirtatious glad you liked it
538000	540360	Oh, ho ho. This is like a 0.1 on the first scale
540400	548280	But she had privately messaged Zymont with the sentiment and characterized his responses as uncomfortable and demeaning. Let's go over their DMS
548440	554160	Thank you for making a video game. Where is there is BDSM Yuri. I'm glad you enjoy it
554240	556240	Yeah question mark seems appropriate
556240	561120	There's a lot less of that type of thing than it was originally because even fewer people would have taken it seriously
561120	568160	Otherwise witness filly is unused typo pose, which you can look up online. That's not good middle enough. Let's see who this person is
568160	573760	Oh, I think it's the lady was streaming the game recently. They mistook button Jupiter for visits the Twitter page
573760	580320	Whoa, you actually have a catch light slash. I like that's some serious production values. I have so many questions
580320	584240	I want to ask that. I'm definitely not going to ask. I'm happy SG is fun for you
584240	590040	I joked about sending the thanks for Yuri fan service message on twitch while playing Eliza story
590040	597640	I also tweeted to an artist who was completely respectful and normal about it. Here's the link this one. I think it's awesome
597640	604280	I understand though. I like DOA a lot, but it gets a lot of negative feedback for being too sexy
604280	609360	I love Philly yellow. Yep. I have played skull goes three times on stream
609360	615440	I really love the style and played Eliza's story today. So that's why I thank you for the your a BDSM
615800	621120	Ask away. I'm a fan of the game so far. It's like really cool and fun for sure
621120	622400	Oh, yes
622400	627240	We had to add all the mommy raps to Eliza's getting throne frames and we wouldn't have gotten the right rating
627240	633160	Also some foam in her bath strangely said nothing about her other storyboat art ask the questions. Well
634000	635680	Okay
635680	639720	Are you putting on the high voice like lots of Japanese ladies do what brought you SG?
639720	645680	Anyway, I guess I've embraced the thirst culture. But like isn't this weird. It's definitely not anyone's fancy
645680	649120	I don't know how I feel at your place. Did you start out with that as a name?
649120	655920	I'm genuinely curious. My voice is real. It gets higher pitch when I'm excited though. I'm cursed with it
655920	658840	I get that question a lot. I like fighting games
658840	663680	I've had an interest since I was a kid and I wanted to revisit some for nostalgia
663680	669880	I found skull girls through recommendations from my fans. It doesn't bother me thirst is human nature
669880	676760	I started as a grab your style model online and did sexy modeling for maybe three years or so before retiring
676800	680160	I retired a year ago to pursue twitch streaming
680160	687320	I'm used to thirst stuff from my job and I'm a huge fan of each artist and the culture so it doesn't really bother me
687480	691800	Well, sorry for ask the dumb comic questions, I know some other ladies like that
691800	694280	I bet it's annoying to get asked to put your parent on the phone
694280	701880	I suppose there's definitely helps sub count and probably validation if external validation is necessary. I'm embarrassed enough streaming at all and I dislike
702680	709120	People so I feel like quantified speaking here. Hey, I'm sort of curious what your family thinks of it
709120	713560	But that's a dangerously close to the coin. What is your boyfriend think promo of you single?
713560	718480	It's just the world up so unfamiliar with gravia the printing process Oh
719160	725640	Google helped you're aware of like the prevalent problems with sexism in the FGC assume. Sorry about that advance
725640	729920	I love the skull girls community in particular is better about it. Anyway, I don't mean to bother you
729920	733560	You're just kind of fascinating and unfamiliar. Well, that's a good weird ending
733560	740840	The validation comment was like very uncomfortable and demeaning. Can you imagine this conversation with a man in the FCG?
741640	746240	Hmm I'm sure you get messages from humans with penises asking that kind of stuff pretty regularly
746280	749800	So if you prefer, how about I acknowledge the brain inside the lady?
749840	753200	It takes a lot of skill and kind of get a certain amount of both
753480	760680	Integrity and ruthlessness to succeed at pretty much anything. So calculating successful person who owns herself. What's your end goal is streaming sustainable
760680	766120	Do you want to own a tech company or manufacture solar cells or grow cute flowers or what?
766120	770380	I'd like to know what to prepare to invest in his responses are creepy
770760	775800	Demeaning and I really don't think you would talk to a man this way in the initial messages
775800	782260	I want comes off as an awkward starstruck nerd bunny replies by blowing up his ego a bit over how much she liked skull girls
782800	786360	Considering that bunny started this conversation with sexual content, you know
786360	789880	The lesbian BDSM thing it makes sense that the conversation might go this way
790040	796280	One of the questions I'm on asks her is what it's like to embrace thirst culture and be the object of people's affections
796400	802000	Bunny replies honestly saying that this is human nature. She's been a model for years. She's used to thirst stuff from her job
802000	804160	She's a big fan of hentai in the surrounding culture
804160	810320	So this type of conversation doesn't bother her after this as I months questions do become more creepy and more personal
810320	814560	But they also kind of read like an awkward nervous nerd who thinks he's having a sexual
814880	820720	Conversation with a girl way out of his league and you know considering how bunny started the conversation with sex
820800	826960	That is one of the possible directions a reasonable person could believe this is gonna go at this point bunny cuts contact with him
826960	829000	And then blasts him online as a creep
829000	831200	But frankly I can see it from both points of view
831520	836720	Bunny seems like somebody who's had to deal with creeps a lot sexual content is likely pretty normalized to her
836720	839480	So to her this was an innocent conversation not a sexual one
839680	846640	Meanwhile as I'm on seems like an otaku who gets exactly zero play and suddenly this hot chick is sliding into his DMS talking about
846640	849280	How grateful she is for his lesbian bondage content?
849280	852320	I can absolutely see a guy like that spilling his spaghetti
852400	858680	But of course bunny only saw fit to release this during Zaymon being canceled over the George Floyd joke
858680	862120	She dropped the logs along with the following public statement
862120	867240	I will no longer be playing skull girls the creator Mike with incredibly
867840	870160	Disrespectful in DMS and made me very uncomfortable
870520	876360	I have shared screenshots of the conversation to others in the FCG and to combo Queens
877040	880980	Combo Queens is a group that tries to get women into the fighting game community
881360	888800	affiliated with combo breaker a professional fighting game event that Mike Z used to commentate for as a result of bunny going public with the
888800	895280	DMS Richard Thire the general manager of Evo and the event director with combo breaker put out this statement in
895480	901080	In addition to the listed reprimands are relayed in the statement released by multiple skullgirls organizers and community members
901080	906240	Mike Z will not be welcome at CB 2021 in addition to well
906240	910960	Uh this account called da purple sharpie who seems to be just a random
911200	918580	Individual speaking for the skullgirls community presented a list of demands that the fans want implemented upon Mike Zaymon in
918720	922560	Retaliation for the whole bunny thing. Yeah, I don't know what the fuck this is all about
922800	927360	These people aren't employees of anything they're not from an organization. They're just fans
927840	928920	Alright, let's read it
928920	935800	Our goal is to create a gaming space that is welcome for all participants regardless of their race gender blah blah blah
935800	943600	We believe Mike Zaymon should no longer be welcome on commentary or participating in events in the skullgirls community as there is no singular
943600	950600	Entity responsible for the skullgirls community for who determines who is allowed on commentary or who determines per event eligibility
950600	954920	We are asking the community to respect and uphold the following actions one
955520	960760	indefinite ban from all commentary to a two-year ban from offline and online
961300	963300	competition until July 30th
963320	971080	2022 our decision to enact and recommend these reprimands was based on Mike's history of problematic behavior in public and
971280	977240	Private including the callous. I can't breathe reference while commentating a match and the reveal of additional inappropriate
977800	983120	Interactions with members of the skullgirls community in private we believe these okay, okay, who's who signed this?
983120	988240	There's a couple of tournament organizers couple of pro fighters and the skullgirls discord administrators
988960	996560	The discord admins guys the jannies do it for free after this a second cosplayer named carbon gray who has annoyingly changed
996560	1003640	Her name to also be bunny since this drop back in 2020 came out with a video making it vague but similar allegations against Zaymon
1003800	1009800	This is like my 20 billionth take I have not yet read bunnies DMS, I don't know what Mike said to her
1009800	1014900	I'm sure it was shitty and I know that because Mike's been making weird sexual comments at me in and out of cosplay
1015240	1020860	Fighting game events for actual years and I've been writing a lot of it off because when I tell people they're just like oh
1021400	1024540	He's kind of like that. I'm sorry and like yeah
1024540	1030160	He is kind of like that and he's kind of not changing for the past five years y'all and like neither is anyone else in
1030160	1035720	The fighting game community and I think a lot of it is because when I tell like my male friends or other TOS what's happening
1035720	1037840	They just kind of don't do anything with that information
1038200	1044200	If you find out that one of your friends is being absolutely weird or creepy to females in the community
1044200	1046720	You need to call them on it and actually hold them accountable
1046920	1050340	This is par for the course when someone's canceled it happened with super mega as well
1050340	1057360	There's generally one person with detailed allegations logs or text or whatever and then a few hanger-ons show up later to literally go me
1057360	1060080	To me too and most of the time they have far less evidence
1060280	1066760	She expanded on her allegations in a series of tweets that basically amounted to Mike said weird sexual shit to me
1066760	1072620	IRL and we're supposed to just take her at her word for the most part what carbon is describing is actually pretty bad if it
1072620	1072960	happened
1072960	1079040	This is all he said she said stuff that she's clearly been holding on to and only dropping right now because Mike's going viral
1079200	1083160	For most of these examples, there's nobody to corroborate carbon story
1083160	1087160	But in one there actually was another witness who told their version of events
1087540	1095660	Mr. Banana god 7 who said on June 29th 2020 during the bunny a you think that Mike tried to laugh it off and apologized
1095840	1097980	Carbon agreed at least enough to like the tweets
1098280	1102360	However, when carbon retells this story two months later in August of 2020
1102360	1109520	She says he could have just apologized two separate people have told me they asked him to apologize to me the apology that banana god 7
1109600	1115040	Confirmed Mike gave and that carbon agreed with has been completely erased from the narrative now
1115040	1119360	Maybe you could say that Mike's apology being of the laughing off of variety was not good enough
1119360	1120680	It wasn't serious or something
1120680	1127220	Maybe that's the case but carbon saying he apologized and I didn't accept it sounds way worse than he didn't apologize
1127220	1134040	Which is in my opinion why the story quietly morphed over time another allegation came from a guy named. Mr
1134040	1140360	Beezle a former employee at lab zero games. I had to dig this shit up on the wayback machine because he's since nuked all
1140360	1141340	of his allegations
1141340	1147200	Mr. Beezle claims that Mike Z scapegoated him gaslit him made verbal threats of violence against him
1147200	1152540	But he saves the worst for last he made a racist remark three times the majority of mr
1152540	1159560	Beezle's thread is focused on the racism and we never actually get any explanation on the threats. They're just forgotten about mr
1159560	1167020	Beezle complained about getting racially profiled as a Latino thug despite describing himself as the stereotypical image of a Latino thug and he called
1167020	1172440	Mike a white man in power who refused to see my reality. This is a really strange allegation, man
1172480	1177600	Mike looks more like a Middle Easterner than a white guy and zymont is a Jewish last name. Oh, he's a colonizer
1177600	1182520	I get it now in actuality. This is another he said she said story and even in mr
1182520	1185080	Beezle's retelling of events Mike doesn't sound like a harasser
1185080	1189820	He sounds like an idiot who is entirely clueless about the intricacies of politics and systemic racism
1189820	1192000	And the only thing I can really say to that is boy
1192000	1197000	I wish that were me all of these other people coming forward with their own Mike Z story
1197160	1200160	Prompted bunny to publicly declare that she felt like she was doing the right thing
1200160	1206280	I was extremely anxious even mentioning anything because it could have been way worse
1206360	1211080	But hearing all the women come forward after my post and bms makes it worth it
1211080	1217040	We need to make the fcg better for women. I am taking the rest of the day to process everything
1217600	1218640	Thank you
1218640	1224840	It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows for her though enough people saw through her bullshit that she began to take flack for this obvious
1224840	1229880	Spin job so much so that she eventually backed down Mike has reached out to me with an apology
1229880	1234120	I really hope this makes him aware of others who have come out in hindsight
1234120	1240680	I feel like I should have handled this differently and I apologize for that. I will be deleting my tweets moving forward
1241080	1244400	It was too little too late for Mike's I'm on though in the eyes of the public
1244400	1245760	He went from being an awkward
1245760	1252460	Flirter to a sex pest to a sexual harasser to a sexual assaulter pretty quick as a result of all of this the board of directors
1252460	1256440	At lab zero games formally requested that he resigned from his position
1256440	1260080	However, you have to remember that Simon wasn't just the lead developer at lab zero games
1260080	1263440	He was also the owner of the company in exchange for his resignation
1263800	1267680	Simon made demands of the board that one member Brian June described as
1268120	1272800	Unrealistically high and potentially illegal the board rejected the demands and in response
1273000	1276520	Simon simply executed his power as owner of the company and dissolved the board
1276600	1281760	He gave all employees an ultimatum if you got a problem with it leave the company by August 31st
1282000	1288040	2020 and so they did a bunch of people left lab zero games publishing statements on social media denouncing
1288240	1295080	Simon shortly after all of us autumn games and the skullgirls mobile developer hidden variable studios announced they were severing ties with
1295240	1296520	Simon and lab zero games
1296520	1302840	They also announced that since autumn games still owns the skullgirls IP they intended to simply continue work on
1303000	1309800	Skullgirls with the employees that had left lab zero games and without Simon the employees made a new studio called future club and began working
1309800	1313440	With autumn games to create additional content for skullgirls second encore
1313720	1320120	Simon dissolved lab zero games shortly afterward which put an early end to updates for indivisible which had just been released
1320160	1323400	The Simon continued to be active in professional fighting game scene
1323400	1325920	But he exited the game development industry for a couple of years
1326080	1332960	He resurfaced in the summer of 2023 as an employee of modus games working on diesel legacy the brazen age
1333120	1335960	It's a hand-drawn 2d fighting game like skullgirls
1335960	1343100	But the animations a completely different style from a heads work the CEO of modus games Christina seal stated directly that she chose to hire
1343120	1347180	Simon for the game not solely because of his extensive experience in the industry
1347180	1351440	But because she believes that he's accepted his guilt and is capable of being reformed
1351480	1356120	I am one of the few women that are CEO's and making games in its entire
1356520	1359760	Industry in a couple years since I made that decision to hire Mike
1359760	1367680	I'm one of the two women CEO's that are running publicly listed companies in the whole industry in the world
1367680	1374240	I did not take this decision lightly when I was talking to Mike and went through the process of figuring out where he was
1374240	1381120	At if you want to have an inclusive environment in the world and you want to have diverse viewpoints all of the things we want
1381720	1383040	diversity equity
1383040	1389300	Inclusion you have to have a path for people to learn and improve you have to create a better
1389400	1394440	Way for them to show the world that they've changed and decided to do better
1394440	1398840	and I really got that from Mike I got that he was committed to it and
1399240	1403400	That he didn't want everything that went down to be the end of his story
1403400	1409800	He wanted the opportunity to have the redemptive arc that's in so many stories that we all love man
1409800	1412480	Maybe I've just become too cynical reading communist theory
1412480	1417240	But this really sounds like Ximont's gone through a struggle session and has come out of it re-educated and de-fanged
1417240	1421640	You know what? I mean? He made an edgy joke at the wrong time in a just society
1421640	1425160	That's something that you apologize for and move on from but that's not what happened
1425240	1431660	one George Floyd joke turned into internet outrage which turned into sexual assault allegations because he was a nerd who thought a hot girl was
1431660	1435960	Flirting with him and his DMS were clipped and shipped at the perfect moment during the cancelling
1436000	1439160	He's not innocent but he's also not guilty of the high crimes
1439160	1443240	Everyone thinks that he is and seal here coming out and saying oh, he's reformed now
1443240	1450960	I've got him on my leash just seems very strange part 3 the censorship with both Ximont and a hat out of the picture and
1450960	1453600	Now considered to be problematic elements by the community
1453600	1457980	It was time for the past of skull girls to be scrubbed clean of any impure elements
1457980	1465480	You know despite being a fan service focus game in June of 2023 skull girls second encore was updated to remove any risque elements
1465520	1473480	This includes removing all panty shots or otherwise sexual shots of the various female characters like torn clothing the BDSM inspired stuff
1473480	1475480	That bunny I you complimented is gone, too
1475600	1480660	Removing the Nazi inspired red armbands of the red egrets one of the game's villainous factions
1480960	1487240	Removing artwork from the game's art book that references either the game's sexuality or the red egrets armbands keep in mind
1487240	1490360	This is a digital art book for the Indiegogo backer version of the game
1490360	1494180	If you crowdfunded this game back in the day your art book has been changed
1494500	1500540	Removing the hair comb in Philia's afro animation presumably because it's some sort of black afro stereotype or something
1500740	1503980	Removing the police brutality scene in big bands story mode
1504260	1510340	Removing sexual jokes like barely legal for reaching an 18 hit combo or peacocks opening reference to hentai
1514380	1518540	Removing the Soviet announcer voice pack. I don't think this is because it made fun of communism
1518540	1521860	It's way more likely that it's because Mike Ximont voiced it
1521900	1525900	Oh and just in case you thought you could download old versions of the game to get around this
1526060	1526580	Yeah
1526580	1528100	Those don't exist anymore on
1528100	1535940	Steam and modern consoles second encore over wrote the originals years ago remember and on older consoles where the original skull girls is still
1535940	1539340	The latest version Konami made them impossible to download years ago
1539340	1542860	But if you had them downloaded you could still play them until recently
1542900	1546780	They were quietly finally disabled off your system in this update
1546780	1550580	I even logged into my old Xbox 360 to see for myself and nope
1550580	1557220	Even though the game has been paid for it's gone on my Xbox series X skull girl second encore is available to purchase
1557220	1561340	No problem. However, I still have the original skull girls registered to the account
1561340	1563580	And if I go to that page in my game library
1563580	1569060	It simply says not available right now or ever again Microsoft as expected
1569060	1571060	There was a huge fan backlash
1571220	1576860	Fan service is a core part of skull girls as identity and removing it basically rips out what made skull girls fun
1576940	1579940	Plus a lot of the stuff that was removed were indie go-go goals
1579940	1582700	Like if they reached X amount of dollars in crowdfunding
1582700	1584100	They would add a perk to the game
1584100	1589780	People had met those goals with their own money and now a decade later the content they funded was being axed for political correctness
1590140	1592900	Fans responded by leaving negative reviews on Steam
1593060	1597300	Causing the 10 year old game to dip into the mostly negative rating for the first time in its history
1597340	1603500	Of course the new developers at Future Club sensor the negative reviews and the score has mostly recovered by now and to be fair
1603500	1608260	There were a lot of people who didn't actually play skull girls leaving negative reviews as well
1608260	1610260	And these guys are clearly jumping on a bandwagon
1610700	1615580	However, the general consensus among the public is that while censoring a fan service game is kind of lame
1615900	1622340	Specifically censoring the art book to remove guest art and concept art that is no longer in line with the current vision of the game
1622340	1625520	Is what reveals this whole thing to have an ideological motive?
1625800	1631880	Anybody who's seen an art book for a game before knows that oftentimes the art in the book doesn't make it into the final game
1631880	1638480	It's meant to show off a work in progress to show how the game evolved from the earliest spitballing of ideas to the current release
1639040	1642840	Censoring the art book is quite literally removing the past and pretending it never happened
1643120	1649960	Another tiny tidbit that shows their intent is how after all the censorship went through they began calling their current round of updates
1650080	1653560	Season one like everything done before this moment just didn't happen
1653560	1660920	It's a very creepy year zero type of stuff and then the legendary discord DMS leaked only adding fuel to the fire
1661000	1666700	Let's read them at rocks chobatsu a lot of the original team went on to do their own thing like richer
1666920	1671760	Alex a had left but not before making a big stink about it. Mike's I'm aunt needs no explanation
1671760	1678480	I'm sure but Mariel Earl Brady Brian Chris. They're all still here Miyazaki the red shinobi. Yeah
1678480	1682800	It's still a majority of the OGs and I knew you guys are never comfortable with certain stuff in the game
1683240	1686280	Aatrox lol. I mean I liken it to just housekeeping
1686760	1688960	Miyazaki and to see so many people say no
1688960	1691520	This is what drew me in specifically just makes me pity them so much
1691960	1694800	Aatrox like there's a dirty sock in the corner
1694800	1698660	That's just been there for years and we only just had time to get it out of the way now
1699280	1704360	2011 was such a different time too. Oh boy a current year reference. Here's the context Miyazaki
1704360	1710160	The red shinobi is the person who took this screenshot and released it to the public since the discord DM window is labeled as sending
1710160	1713720	Messages to a trucks unless somebody stole Miyazaki's phone and released it or something
1713720	1718300	We can assume it was him who sent it a quick check online shows that Miyazaki has been a longtime
1718600	1725640	Skullgirls fan having been part of the skullgirls fan website skull heart calm ever since the game launched and posting on the skullgirls
1725640	1732640	Discord as far back as 2015 his pics of account also has a bunch of skullgirls lewd fan art favorited either
1732760	1739120	He genuinely agrees with the current skullgirl censorship as he originally wrote in the DM making him kind of hypocritical or he struck up
1739120	1743440	This conversation with one of the developers with the express purpose of making them put their foot in their mouths
1743440	1749160	I tend to believe it's the latter because this conversation does not make the developers look good and he chose to release it plus
1749160	1753840	I'm currently in the skullgirls discord myself and checking out his profile on old messages
1753840	1758300	It seems like he's been kicked from the server. It sounds like he was our guy getting us some info
1758400	1762360	Also, just real quick during my perusal of the skullgirls discord public channels
1762400	1769000	It seems like they purged not only trolls and shit stirrers, but genuine fans who expressed discontentment at the changes
1769440	1773480	Atrox Chobatsu is one of the current artists working for Future Club on skullgirls
1773480	1778460	And as far as I can tell he was not a part of the original team back during the Reverge lab days
1778680	1781820	He's very lefty hailing from Portland. We all know what that place already
1781920	1786760	He's also the guy who hosts the skullgirls animation streams on Twitch. I watched a bit of them
1786760	1789600	There's nothing really going on there. In fact, he generally doesn't talk
1789640	1793200	He actually just types in the chat in between drawing or whatever
1793240	1797720	He hasn't publicly said anything directly with the controversy but two days after it broke
1797720	1799080	He posted this on Twitter
1799080	1804880	Is it considered censorship if I wanted to remove my tattoo of Yuji Naka's face from my left armpit?
1804880	1809720	I don't know. I'm just not feeling the same reverence I had for the man 20 years ago. It was a different time
1809720	1812520	I was younger and stupider, but not by much in my opinion
1812520	1815920	This is a tongue-in-cheek jab at people who were crying censorship over skullgirls
1815960	1821900	His positions clear the current legal owners of the skullgirls property who are not the original duo who conceived of it anymore
1821920	1825240	Don't like some parts of the game and they want to update it which yes
1825240	1831160	They have the legal right to do but that also means pissing off everyone who doesn't agree with their new vision and those people
1831160	1834400	They're not likely to keep supporting you the DMS show that at least
1834400	1840440	Atrox believes rewriting the past and updating it to fit modern progressive sensibilities is a good thing as he seems like the type to
1840440	1842440	Develop some variant of trolls remorse
1842560	1846000	He used to make kind of edgy stuff back on Newgrounds and in one of his old
1846160	1852280	Animations from 2012 it cuts away to some real-life pictures of somebody that I assumed to be him since he does talk about himself as being
1852280	1853480	the artist of the animation
1853480	1859440	He looks like a pretty normal internet nerd from that era and most Millennials cut from this cloth suffer from trolls remorse today
1859440	1862560	For example, despite his current very progressive sensibilities
1862560	1868520	His personal YouTube channel has a video from 2009 where he's goofing around with his friends and one of them says faggot
1872440	1874440	You're not the father
1889000	1892400	The worst words are ones that are not spoken, okay
1893920	1899580	I'm not pointing this out to cancel him even though an edgy joke is literally what got the cancel ball rolling on Mike Simon
1899580	1905060	I'm only pointing out that just like the tattoo allegory implies. This is clearly not something that he'd do nowadays
1905060	1910960	Oh, also, he's out here talking about how problematic skullgirls is while drawing lewd furry artwork
1910960	1911860	Good job, dude
1911860	1918540	with all of this being understood the current public narrative regarding skullgirls is that the two original creators a hat and
1918660	1921420	Zymont were slowly weaseled out of their successful
1921600	1925820	profitable IP their life's work their dream and the current owners being
1925940	1932080	Progressives with no respect for the property its history the original creators vision or frankly what the fans want are now
1932380	1938020	Repurposing skullgirls to suit their needs updating it for modern standards by removing what people love from the game
1938020	1944540	I understand why that's the public narrative considering how often this sort of thing happens nowadays and how it looks from the outside
1944540	1948860	But it's also not completely accurate. There is more going on here
1948860	1950340	But in order to understand it
1950340	1955500	We're gonna have to dive into a topic that has until very recently largely flown under the radar
1955900	1963340	Part four the lawsuit while the initial idea for the skullgirls universe might have come from Alex a hat and the game engine from Mike
1963340	1967060	Zymont they aren't the only people who have been attached to the project since the very beginning
1967540	1974500	Marielle Cartwright one of the original animators who was on the skullgirls project from day one of it hitting reverb labs is just as
1974580	1979860	Crucial to the development of the game as the two boys are and she is the central focus of the skullgirls lawsuit
1980140	1983980	After lab zero games collapsed and Mike Z laid off all remaining staff
1984140	1988300	Marielle Cartwright got together with the company's financial officer and producer for indivisible
1988460	1990860	Francesca Esquenazi and in early 2021
1990860	1997540	They fired off a lawsuit against lab zero games and Mike Z for wrongful termination on April 1st, 2021
1997540	1999060	I bet they thought it was an April Fool's joke
1999060	2003580	Mike filed a countersuit with Superior Court of the state of California against Marielle and
2003620	2009300	Francesca and against the company that all the lab zero games former employees had founded to continue the skullgirls work
2009460	2011460	Future Club the court document is
2011980	2014700	207 pages long and linked in the description if you want to read it for yourself
2015060	2022980	The claims Mike makes within the documents are backed up with dozens upon dozens of pages filled with internal chat logs at lab zero games
2023120	2028060	Private messages between Mike Marielle and Francesca and public communications that provide additional context
2028100	2032820	So let's dive in the court docs begin with describing skullgirls and lab zero games
2032820	2035260	Which we already know about as well as what a slack channel is
2035460	2042100	Presumably because the American court system is full of boomers and then we get to the third section titled my history of autism spectrum disorder
2042220	2047700	Mike described what he had known all of his life as Mike being Mike an inability to understand social boundaries
2047900	2051140	Maintain friendships and just generally deal with people properly
2051140	2056660	He confided in Marielle and Francesca whom he described as his close friends and with their encouragement
2056660	2061180	He eventually went to a therapist and got an autism diagnosis in the next section
2061180	2065940	He describes his friendship with Marielle Cartwright in 2010 Marielle was brought on to Reverge labs
2066300	2071500	Specifically to work as an animator for skullgirls under Alex a had who was I think the creative director
2071500	2073980	She would become the lead animator in 2012
2074100	2080820	Mike and Marielle became close friends talking and going on walks frequently in Marielle's public statement when she left lab zero games
2080820	2086140	She claimed that Mike harassed her at work. There was years of sexual comments uncomfortable jokes unwanted hugs
2086180	2093060	He apparently suggested she helped him masturbate she claimed to talk to him about how uncomfortable she felt in 2017 and in return
2093060	2094380	He called her a hypocrite
2094380	2101060	Marielle says that this hypocrisy stemmed from how she dressed in public implying that Mike believed her way of dressing allowed him to sexually
2101060	2104860	Harass her. However, this isn't the whole story in the court documents
2104860	2107940	Mike provides tons of slack logs showing on-the-job
2108420	2116100	Conversations as well as Marielle's private messages to him directly where she regularly engaged in conversations with him about sex sexual orientation
2116340	2117940	urination pornography
2117940	2123700	prostitution threesomes plastic surgery body image issues and on and on she began these
2123980	2131100	Conversations herself and expected him to participate her behavior led Mike to believe that this type of talk was welcome and ordinary in the course
2131100	2137700	Of their friendship. She also regularly engaged in this type of talk with other co-workers and drew pornographic artwork while on the clock
2137700	2144040	Which she displayed in the office at least that's how Mike characterized these chat logs in the court documents
2144040	2148600	And you know being somebody who's around their age. I'm a millennial. They're Millennials. We're all in our 30s
2148600	2155400	This is how people of my age group talk when they're friends and not just you know casual work
2155720	2163080	Acquaintances all of these logs read to me like they were actually genuine friends and that whatever banter they have going on is
2163400	2168560	Clearly welcome and also a two-way street. Also. I'm not getting Naomi to do the voice for this one
2168560	2171500	I don't think she wants to do a stereotypical Asian accent
2174040	2176040	I
2176200	2181160	Francesca Esquenazi had a similar friendship with Mike. He met her while she was working at a GameStop in
2181600	2184800	2005 before either of them had begun their professional careers in
2185680	2189060	2007 while Mike was working as a programmer at pandemic studios
2189060	2192120	He was able to get her a job as a receptionist this began
2192240	2195720	Francesca's career working in the paper-pushing side of the games industry in
2196320	2199160	2016 he brought her into the skullgirls project as a producer
2199360	2206320	Mike and Francesca's friendship was similar to Mike and Mariel's with lewd or inappropriate topics of conversation being a part of the normal course
2206320	2212620	Of their interactions and again, it wasn't one-sided. They both began these conversations and expected the other to participate
2212720	2218240	They had been friends for 15 years and Mike describes several personal events that he helped her through weddings
2218680	2224360	Tragedies Mike helped Francesca come to terms with the death of her child the subsequent gender transition of her husband
2224360	2228080	How her marriage and sex life were affected how menstruation made her feel inadequate?
2228520	2231840	Mike took up a role of stability in Francesca's personal life
2232280	2236780	Next up in the court documents is Mike describing in detail the bunny a you canceling event
2236780	2241000	You know, it makes sense that they be in the court docs because it is one of the big events that led to the destruction of
2241000	2241720	lab zero games
2241720	2248220	But it's still kind of surreal to see internet shit in a court filing Mike confirms that his conversation with bunny a you happened on May
2248240	2255120	13th 2020 when bunny released her version of these DMS after the George Floyd joke in late June of 2020
2255160	2258480	They showed that she took the screen caps when the DMS were one day old
2258600	2266140	This means that bunny deliberately sat on these DMS until she could release that the most opportune moment for maximum damage to Mike
2266240	2272920	He also revealed that bunny privately apologized to him something that was left out of the original version of events on June 29th
2272920	2276160	Mike expressed his frustrations to Mariel over the situation
2276320	2282980	Highlighting the obvious double standard when bunny a you makes the conversation about sexuality and skull girls and her own sexually charged career
2283500	2289580	But when Mike engages with the conversation on that level bunny frames it as if he would never talk to a man in the fighting
2289580	2296340	Game community like this in response Mariel said directly to Mike that all men have to deal with the result of what shitty men have
2296340	2300980	Done but also that she didn't want him to quit lab zero games and that if she had the power to fire him
2300980	2306340	She wouldn't over this the conversations tone seems to imply that Mariel knows Mike is innocent
2306340	2312140	But also that her progressive politics apply a collective male guilt to him that she isn't directly pushing but that he is
2312260	2314620	Rejecting and she is uncomfortable with that rejection
2315140	2318920	Meanwhile in a conversation between Francesca and Mariel where Mike isn't present
2319040	2325520	Francesca directly says that she thinks a bunny a you baited Mike that bunny started the conversation weird that she didn't believe that Mike meant
2325520	2329980	To demean bunny and that bunny deliberately cut out Mike's apology in order to paint him a certain way
2330360	2334620	Mariel agreed with Francesca's assessment in the public lab zero slack channel
2334620	2340400	They reiterated this position saying that Mike was innocent at the same time in a previous slack channel for women only Mariel
2340680	2346520	Francesca and several female employees outline that they've all had experiences with Mike where he's been inappropriate
2346520	2351000	But also that they all know he doesn't do it purposefully. He's been apologetic every time it's happened
2351000	2353440	He's worked to make up for it and he genuinely tries to be better
2353440	2357240	But also that his autism makes it hard for him one employee asks
2357240	2360640	How many fires are we going to have to put out and that if it wasn't for his autism?
2360640	2362640	This would be a lot more cut and dry
2362680	2367440	This is where the scheme to take control of lab zero games began with Mariel and Francesca
2367600	2373520	Understanding full well that Mike was doing his best with them openly admitting that they truly believed he was but nonetheless
2373800	2379480	Reluctantly deciding that it was time to take control from him. Well, it was reluctant initially by the end of June 29th
2379480	2384560	They were privately messaging each other discussing removing Mike from his leadership position on June 30th
2384780	2391760	Francesca and Mariel scheduled two team meetings one with Mike present and one without they were scheduled in the company's Google Calendar
2391760	2394420	We only have Mike's word as to what happened at the one meeting
2394900	2399140	He claims that the two women encouraged all of the employees to bash him to his face
2399260	2403980	He admits to crying during the meeting and being forced to explain his autism to the entire company
2403980	2406660	The woman then ended the meeting by claiming it was a waste of time
2406740	2410780	It was at this point that Mike believes Francesca and Mariel had a change of heart
2410780	2411920	They were no longer
2411920	2417500	Understanding about his autism or his good faith efforts to fix things they no longer care that he was innocent with regards to bunny
2417500	2424280	Are you and they were beginning to retroactively redefine all of their past interactions as harassment an hour after the meeting Mariel
2424280	2430560	Formed a new slack channel called Z Z Z where everyone but Mike was present with the express purpose of planning to undermine
2430560	2435800	Mike's ownership of lab zero games one of their plans involved removing Mike from a leadership and
2436000	2438760	Ownership position and allowing him to stay on as a contractor
2439140	2444040	Francesca pitched the idea of the entire team up and leaving seeing as they still had connections and options
2444440	2450320	Mariel says that she still considers Mike a friend but that he's destroying the team and he has to go they discussed the peril of
2450320	2454840	Having to explain to the publisher of the next game focus all of this internal turmoil and how it will affect
2455040	2461600	Focuses support and funding of lab zero games and then Mariel says this I oh no, this is manipulative
2461600	2464400	I wonder if it would go over better if Mike stepped down on his own
2464400	2469280	It will look bad to focus if Franny and I asked Mike to leave but if Mike steps down it would be better
2469320	2475220	This was the beginning of Mariel's plot to manipulate Mike to voluntarily step down from his own company by intentionally
2475360	2479840	Misrepresenting the situation to focus as she was afraid of them pulling funding for lab zeros next game
2480000	2485600	Part of this plot involved absolutely nothing of this going public as Mariel directly stated. Yes. It looks bad
2485600	2488320	But if we make a public statement that makes us look slightly better
2488320	2490480	But then lose all of our jobs and close the company
2490480	2492680	What good will that have done by the end of the day?
2492800	2497320	Francesca had drafted an email to focus as the launching of their plan and Mariel approved of it
2497320	2502000	They intended to manipulate Mike into stepping down by misrepresenting their upcoming meeting with focus
2502280	2506920	Specifically the two told Mike that unless he was gone focus was pulling out in a future meeting
2507080	2509560	Representatives from focus directly denied this to Mike's face
2509560	2517480	In fact, Francesca later admitted that what they had said regarding focus and Mike was not true while she characterized it as a misunderstanding
2517880	2520640	This statement reads like she got caught and she knows it
2520840	2527480	Mariel had concocted the whole story that focus was pulling out if Mike wasn't gone under the belief that focus would continue to work with
2527480	2531680	Them if they managed to get rid of Mike themselves the next day July 1st
2531800	2537240	2020 the group was discussing forming a new company without Mike still using lab zeros official slack
2537360	2543760	They explicitly stated they intended to take over all of lab zeros contracts with Mariel and Francesca at the helm of a new company
2543800	2547320	Without any of the baggage of lab zero games and none of its debt
2547560	2553060	They were aware that this meant leaving Mike with the responsibility of paying focus back all of the money
2553060	2558280	They provided to fund the next game along with other business debts totaling around one and a half million dollars
2558280	2563060	They initially didn't seem thrilled at the idea of leaving Mike with all the lab zero debt
2563060	2569280	But as the summer dragged on they warmed up to the idea with Mariel at one point threatening to use the debt as a weapon
2569280	2576300	Against him. It's at this point that as their plans began to develop Mariel and Francesca began to harden against Mike's autism reasoning
2576300	2579880	Which they had accepted just a few days prior on July 4th 2020
2579880	2584520	Mariel said I don't buy as excuse of a checklist and never trying to hurt anyone to do anything bad anymore
2584520	2590320	And I don't accept autism as an excuse anymore while Francesca said that though she doesn't think Mike is a monster
2590320	2592760	She also doesn't feel like she can believe anything
2592760	2599720	he says anymore as an explanation even though Mariel and Francesca had previously stated that they knew Mike didn't harass anybody and
2599920	2602000	Falsely accusing him of harassment would ruin his life
2602000	2608560	They had decided to maliciously characterize his conduct as harassment in order to drum up public support for their new company
2608560	2613480	But specifically in a way that protects them Mariel said we can't acknowledge any lack of knowledge
2613840	2619000	Enabling or wrongdoing because that validates Max's claims and allows him to come after us
2619000	2624800	The other ones also open us up to Mike coming after us for defamation. The defamation thing is obvious
2624800	2626160	But who is this max guy?
2626160	2632260	The only person named max who once worked at lab zero games is apparently a person named max gone
2632260	2637800	At least that's his profile over at art station calm under the screen named B's all aka our friend. Mr
2637800	2640780	Beezwell from earlier the Latino who accused Mike of violent threats
2640780	2644960	But never actually provide any proof of them in his long thread full of bullshit nonsense
2644960	2650100	He actually blames Mariel and Francesca for enabling and supporting Mike's mistreatment
2650220	2653160	This meant that Mariel and Francesca had a tight line to walk
2653240	2656520	They needed to make the claim that Mike was actually the harasser
2656520	2663720	They previously said that he wasn't while at the same time at not giving any ammo to mr. Beezwell that frames them as harassers themselves
2664040	2666680	Bitches be calculating by July 16th
2666880	2673720	Mariel began characterizing Mike as the aggressor and reframing all of their past actions within an abuser victim dynamic
2673860	2680440	By August 6th Mariel seemed to simply view Mike as an enemy saying I don't even want to like get him back or ruin of
2680440	2686600	Her anything just leave please just leave forever the plan for everybody to abandon lab zero games was underway
2686880	2693800	Employees were waiting for a specific time that time came and on August 24th 2020 the implosion of lab zero games was underway
2694200	2697140	Employees announced the resignation in unison including Mariel
2697640	2704220	Francesca due to her access to the company's financial information knew that quitting at this specific time would maximize damage to the company
2704220	2710320	It was just before payroll was going out for the next month and the conspirators had managed to convince focus not to pay them their
2710320	2717160	Next reimbursement with no money coming in and no staff to perform any work lab zero games was forced to shutter its doors and lay
2717160	2724020	Off any remaining employees including Francesca by September 6th 2020 Kim McCaskill a woman who works in the games
2724040	2728880	Industry and who is well known for her strong public stance against the sexual harassment of women in game development
2729440	2734760	Privately spoke to all parties involved and discovered that none of them even mentioned harassment at Simon's hands at all
2734760	2737600	In fact the whole thing appeared like they were using the sexual
2737640	2745000	Harassment claim to drag Simon through the mud in retaliation for him not following through on making lab zero games a worker cooperative
2745520	2747120	Apparently due to the negative experience
2747120	2753880	everybody had working at Reverge labs the long term plan for lab zero games after Mike Z took over was that he would turn it
2753880	2758420	Into a worker cooperative a business model where all workers have an equal share of company ownership
2758840	2761760	However, there were two reasons as to why this wasn't possible
2762600	2769580	Firstly it turns out that lab zeros corporate lawyer went over the options with Mike Mariel and Francesca and told them that giving the employees
2769580	2775440	A bunch of stock in the company in order to make it into a worker co-op would massively raise those employees taxes
2775440	2776600	Which does make sense?
2776600	2782520	They now have a lot more net worth being part owners of a successful company the employees didn't want to pay more taxes
2782520	2788200	Obviously, but Mariel and Francesca interpreted this event as proof that Mike was refusing to fulfill his promise to the team
2788440	2794760	However back on June 29th Mariel admitted outright she understood the reason the company was in a co-op wasn't Mike's fault
2794760	2797880	He was more than willing. It was a legal problem on June 30th
2797880	2803720	She said that the team should only buy up shares of lab zero games and turn it into a worker co-op that way if Mike
2803720	2808480	Were gone on July 2nd at Mariel no longer trust him with the shares on July 27th
2808480	2813880	Mariel says that no one's paying Mike anything for his shares of the company the implication being that they just want it for free
2814120	2816000	Something that was legally difficult
2816000	2819720	Secondly all of the new co-owners would be on the hook for lab zeros debt
2820040	2826200	Mariel broke down the details of the 1.5 million dollar business debt in one of the chat logs focus is owed
2827360	2830440	$775,000 that is their publishers investment into their next game
2830440	2834440	Which they expect game sales to recoup if the game doesn't come out they're on the hook for the money
2834960	2840440	Arsenal is owed $100,000. That's the company's agent Brandon is owed $40,000
2840440	2844240	That's the company's lawyer seems like they had some bills that needed paying Alex is owed
2844640	2849160	$50,000 that's Alex a had settlement that was mentioned earlier and Peter is owed
2850200	2858320	$450,000 who's Peter a PlayStation blog post about skullgirls was credited to Peter Bartholow the CEO of lab zero games a
2858400	2864680	quick internet search reveals that Peter Bartholow began his career as a games journalist writing about video games in newspapers back in
2865000	2868000	1994 through industry connections he made in journalism
2868120	2871000	He landed a job with origin systems working on Ultima games
2871240	2876840	This began his game development career, and he worked at multiple studios before ending up with Reverge labs in 2010
2876960	2880880	He was one of the people who made the move from Reverge labs to lab zero games
2881120	2887280	Peter being the only member of Reverge labs with any business experience and having any capital became the company's sole owner
2887720	2893880	According to Mike's court documents an unnamed CEO and sole shareholder of lab zero games left the company in
2894000	2899160	2018 upon which Mike became the new owner this had to have been Peter the timeline matches up
2899200	2901200	So why was Peter Bartholow owed?
2902000	2907820	$450,000 was it compensation for his initial seed capital was it a settlement like Alex a had well at one point
2908120	2911640	Francesca mentions offhandedly when I was getting really sick of all the Peter crap
2911640	2915260	I mentioned I might want to leave and start my own thing the company lawyer
2915320	2920480	Meanwhile in an email mentions what he calls the Peter buyout. This is just speculation on my part
2920480	2921260	We don't have the whole story
2921260	2925520	But it sounds like the team ended up disliking Peter and at some point in 2018
2925520	2930040	Bought his share of the company in order to be rid of him which the company still owed debt on
2930480	2935520	Also, it's possible that Alex left around the same time as Peter. Yeah, I'm jumping ahead in the story
2935520	2938280	There's circumstantial evidence that kind of proves this later in the video
2938280	2944600	Which is interesting because it implies a pattern of people at the bottom of lab zero games purposely pushing out the people at the top
2945000	2951400	Marielle even admits as much on July 1st. I don't think I feel comfortable staying at lab zero if Mike is gone
2951520	2953280	That's not in defense of Mike
2953280	2959320	But rather what it means for what the studio has become and how that impacts us who remain lab zero has so much baggage
2959640	2966200	We've rightfully hosted all the people we need to but what remains is not the company that was founded initially and we're left with all
2966200	2973160	the stories the hurt the literal lawsuits and settlements and hundreds of thousands of dollars owed to people and on a personal note Tyson
2973240	2979440	Expressed he was nervous for how all this makes me and Franny look as people who weren't at the top that kicked all key members
2979440	2984520	Out and now lead the company. It's entirely possible that Peter left due to workplace disputes
2984800	2990560	Alex left due to workplace disputes Mike was being pushed out due to workplace disputes while Marielle and
2990720	2998000	Francesca both served to benefit from all the original core players moving on while also being at least part of the reason why they
2998000	3000720	Moved on but that's just my personal conjecture
3001240	3004240	Finally on September 23rd one of the employees that left
3004400	3008540	DM to Mike directly on discord and said that it was actually all about
3008600	3013140	Ownership of company in the end that everyone else was tired of waiting for equity distribution
3013160	3020060	During the public collapse of lab zero games one of the former employees Brian June had been answering questions on Twitter
3020060	3023160	That's where we got the information about Alex's settlement. For example
3023160	3029180	He also said however that Mike was never intended to be the owner of lab zero games after Peter had been bought out
3029660	3032420	Ownership was transferred to him temporarily for legal safety
3032420	3038000	But everyone had agreed to eventually turn the business into a worker co-op and Mike seemed to be trying to do just that
3038300	3043180	The roadblocks appear to be legal not personal but everybody blamed him and retaliated against him
3043180	3049100	Anyway, when he finally wielded the legal power of ownership that he held against the employees trying to dethrone him
3049100	3052800	They took it as a sign that Mike was never going to play ball and was just stringing them along
3052900	3058300	but Mike wielded that power because he believed he was being set up as a fall guy for all the problems a
3058300	3063220	Belief that the slack messages seemed to corroborate. So since we're pretty deep into the weeds here
3063220	3066060	Let me give you a quick recap of what we discovered from the court documents
3066260	3071760	Reverge labs collapses like a decade ago the core team reforms as lab zero games with Peter as CEO
3072060	3080240	Alex Mike Mariel and anyone else important to skullgirls comes along for the ride over the years a Peter and Alex both leave under weird
3080580	3085540	circumstances what we do know is that the company owes them money and Mariel states that her and
3085660	3090420	Francesca removing them and moving into more of a management role themselves was good and necessary
3091260	3094260	Skullgirls development winds down and the focus shifts to indivisible
3094480	3099540	After Peter and Alex are gone Mike owns the company and everyone agrees to turn it into a worker co-op
3099620	3104580	Mike has significant legal troubles trying to do so in June of 2020 several public
3104780	3111180	Controversies go viral all stemming from Mike's autism and social awkwardness each of which he apologizes profusely for on
3111500	3119460	August 24th 2020 a huge swath of lab zero games is staff all resign at the same time having coordinated their responses with
3119580	3123300	Francesca's financial data in order to cause maximum damage to the company
3123580	3128900	Despite the former staffs public statements claiming that they've spent the summer of 2020 engaged in an internal investigation
3129380	3136120	Their private chat logs show that they were already creating plans to either remove Mike from his own company or quit and form a new
3136120	3143080	Company one day after the bunny au thing went viral before anyone even knew the truth of it if they managed to wrestle control
3143080	3149720	Of lab zero games their long-term plan was to keep Mike on as a contractor to wrap up any remaining work on the current projects
3149720	3153960	Before eventually quietly firing him if not they would all quit in unison
3153960	3159120	Which is what they did and use their knowledge of lab zero games as inner workings to saddle Mike with the business debt
3159200	3164900	Steal and use the skullgirls contract as a quick moneymaker to get on their feet and then move on to different projects
3165120	3172180	They explicitly schemed to use Mike's various viral controversies as a public justification for these actions
3172340	3175820	The man they were friends with for 10 years in a matter of weeks
3175820	3182980	They went from being understanding to hating him even as they learned more about his neurodivergency in that same time frame
3182980	3183740	Oh also
3183740	3190580	Maryland Francesca knew they were doing some fucky shit because despite Mike's lawyer telling them they should not delete messages on lab zero games
3190580	3193860	Slack they tried to delete messages on lab zero games as slack
3194100	3198860	With all this shit stacked against them what Mike filed ultimately was a countersuit
3199140	3203140	Remember Maryland Francesca filed against him first for wrongful termination
3203140	3204780	I guess they saw the fat
3204780	3208900	Paychecks that Alex and Peter were getting and decided to get some of that for themselves on the way out the door
3209280	3216780	Also the chat logs show them shifting from empathetic towards Mike and reluctant to take action against their friend in June 2020 to outright
3216780	3218700	Hating him by August of 2020
3218780	3224960	It's certainly possible that by January of 2021 when they filed the suit all feelings of friendship were gone
3224960	3227440	And they simply viewed Mike as a resource to exploit
3227740	3230320	But I think they overextended their hand on this one
3230660	3233400	Francesca was laid off because the company could no longer do any work
3233400	3239420	That's not wrongful termination and Mariel didn't quit she resigned but maybe she means the disbanding of the board who knows
3239500	3245180	But what we do know is that Mike only slapped them with all of this shit after they came for him legally
3245380	3252100	Mike countersued Mariel Francesca and Future Club for interfering with lab zero games as contracts and relationships
3252100	3257380	Which had fallen apart due to the two women's plans who are now CEO and creative director of Future Club
3257420	3264500	respectively the damages stem from losing the skullgirls contract the shutdown of the indivisible game including the loss of a contract for an
3264580	3266180	unannounced but in production
3266180	3273440	Indivisible animated series with NBC as well as an unannounced contract with Arc System Works the creator of guilty gear that Bridget game
3273640	3278640	Lab zero games was going to be collaborating on probably the biggest anime fighting IP in the world
3278840	3282740	Mariel and Francesca tried to get the countersuit dismissed using anti slap laws
3283200	3288980	slap stands for strategic lawsuit against public participation and it refers to people using the courts and the threat of
3289000	3292100	Lawsuit to intimidate those who are exercising their First Amendment rights
3292400	3298120	most of the time anti slap laws come into play when somebody with influence threatens those who are speaking out against them with a
3298120	3304480	Lawsuit in order to stifle their speech and this is what Mariel and Francesca alleged that Mike's detailed countersuit was intended to do
3304480	3308720	In fact their lawyer compared the situation to Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels
3309000	3315760	But in March of 2022 the judge disagreed ruling that the countersuit can proceed that this wasn't a free speech issue
3315760	3319320	But a labor relations issue, but by April of 2023
3319320	3325120	It seems like the anti slap denial had been overturned and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings
3325200	3331800	I'm actually not really sure since this case isn't being talked about anywhere online right now and all the official documents are heavy in legalese
3331800	3338720	but it sounds like where the case is at right now is that the court agrees that Mariel and Francesca's case arises in part from
3338720	3345080	Their public statements relevant to a public issue and therefore Mike's countersuit may be a malicious use of the court against them
3345080	3352140	But only if Mike's own case against them is baseless and the court outlined four of Mike's complaints that he might actually
3352380	3357860	Legally win on on their merits independent of the woman's public speech and so they sent the whole thing back to trial
3357940	3363420	So who knows where this goes the best I can tell is that their day in court has been set for February 6 2024
3363660	3366020	Man, now this video feels kind of incomplete, doesn't it?
3366020	3370100	I considered waiting to do this until the court date, you know to have a nice little bow to tie in the whole story
3370100	3373220	But who knows how long the trial might take it might be postponed
3373220	3378540	It might get appealed the Mike's I'm on versus future Club legal battle has already been quietly going on for two years
3378620	3380620	And it could go on for another two
3380660	3383220	Unfortunately, though that means we're all just sitting here with blue balls
3383340	3388140	But maybe I can offer you something else to tide you over until then part 5
3388580	3394580	Mariel Cartwright of the main woman in this lawsuit Francesca Esquenazi is clearly the more elusive of the two
3394740	3400580	She spoke significantly less in the slack channels than her counterpart and there's not much in the way of public appearances of her out there
3400580	3402260	I'm personally not surprised
3402260	3407880	Remember she was a GameStop clerk that Mike basically turned into a receptionist and she worked primarily in the
3408040	3411640	Financial and administrative side of the business but Mariel Cartwright
3411640	3415520	She's an animator by trade and the internet is littered with her various public appearances
3415520	3419800	A lot of these are simply animation workshops or doing press tours for games
3419800	3424480	But others are personal interviews and in those interviews, she said some very interesting things
3424840	3430480	So let's take a look at who Mariel Cartwright is at least who she appears to be from my point of view
3430800	3434560	There's a handful of primary sources. I'm going to be jumping between in order to make my point
3434600	3436760	They're all publicly available on YouTube
3436760	3440240	So if you think I'm somehow misrepresenting Mariel or I've got something wrong
3440240	3443920	They are all available for you to watch yourself. The major interviews
3443920	3446460	I'm going to be talking about are in chronological order one
3446720	3452480	Mariel's first ever on-camera appearance in an interview with Destructoid on December 23rd 2012
3452900	3459280	Two an interview of multiple lab zero games artists for the black torch anthology, which seems to be an art book
3459280	3461280	They all worked on on May 9th 2013
3461880	3469280	Three a panel on how to animate for video games that Mariel gave at a digital dragons convention on July 1st 2014
3469800	3476160	Four an interview that Mariel gave to the fighting game YouTube channel Pat the flip on February 2nd 2016
3476440	3482800	Five a GDC presentation of indivisible hosted by Mariel and Mike on October 11th 2019
3483120	3489440	Six an interview Mariel and her husband Tyson gave for mega 64 on July 25th 2020
3489440	3496520	And finally seven an interview Mariel gave with the horror game Awards on October 30th 2023, which is just a week ago
3496800	3500120	There's also a few other clips that I couldn't get an exact date on but they're short ones
3500120	3505180	I'll make sure to display on screen exactly which source I'm pulling the statements from let's get into it
3505520	3512440	Mariel's dad is an animator for Disney and her mother is a Japanese citizen. My dad was a Disney animator for most of my childhood
3513560	3516320	and my mom is Japanese
3517040	3519920	So it was just like this this blend of
3521300	3525640	You know Japanese culture Japanese films just you know, everything Japanese
3526640	3528260	combined with
3528260	3530260	My dad is a gigantic nerd
3531640	3533640	So it's Disney animation
3534040	3535920	He you know, he had the Atari
3535920	3541680	He was doing like a little bit of programming and he would get me into video games and stuff a quick Google search of Disney
3541680	3547220	Animators with the family named Cartwright revealed a Randy Cartwright who had a very prolific career at Disney
3547220	3553100	He was offered a job at a Japanese studio in the 80s where he trained Japanese animators on the general Disney style
3553480	3557040	Mariel grew up as a Sega kid and was in love with Sonic back in the 90s
3561680	3563680	Sonic
3572360	3574200	When I was like
3574200	3578600	maybe nine or so, my dad gave me a oh my goddess and
3579600	3580600	Rama
3580600	3585680	Look that he didn't need anymore. And then from there I started getting into all that kind of stuff
3586360	3590920	She ended up spending a lot of time drawing influenced by both of her parents preferred art styles
3591000	3594440	Was your father being an animator a burden or a help?
3596480	3598940	No, it was it was definitely a good thing
3599700	3601540	I remember
3601540	3606660	You know being very young and being able to go to my dad and ask questions about how you know
3606660	3608660	how do I draw this or that or
3609140	3613960	And you know, he would he would sometimes help out and be like, you know, ask me questions
3613960	3617260	like how do I think I would draw this and then he would show me the right way to do it and
3619100	3625540	No, he was he was great Mariel met the mega 64 guys at their first ever panel in 2006
3625660	3631540	She got to know them personally during this event and ended up helping them make a lot of their content mostly behind the scenes
3632460	3634460	How did me and Mariel meet?
3634500	3636500	She was at
3636860	3639340	Our first panel. It's so weird
3640780	3644020	Because that we the first panel we ever did
3645060	3651180	was at anime Los Angeles in 2006, that was the first panel we ever did and
3652180	3659180	In that room that audience was maybe 50 to 80 people that was I mean that was it and
3660420	3663540	In yet in that group was more
3664340	3666540	People that would affect my life than any other
3667380	3672300	Like like I met Mariel and all her friends people other people that I grew to know
3673180	3675380	other famous artists
3676980	3678980	That work with her and
3679740	3683200	Worked in the game industry stuff like that. They were in there
3683820	3689940	There there were other girls in there that I that I would later like years later like I dated
3690540	3694700	Like a couple different people who didn't even know each other in that same room
3695700	3698300	Who just happened to live in you know, Southern California?
3698300	3703260	I guess she would have been 18 at this time way before her professional animation career ever got started
3703260	3706740	You you're I mean, honestly, I think out of all the artists that we work with
3706740	3712660	I think we've been doing that stuff with you the longest I think of anybody I think
3713540	3717820	I was just saying I think it's like 14 or 15 years. I think I started this when I was
3719380	3721380	818 that's crazy
3721540	3723540	And I'm 33
3724100	3731580	Mariel attended the California Institute of the Arts otherwise known as Cal Arts. Well that explains a lot of the story we had like a
3732540	3734140	portfolio
3734140	3737020	Show thing at Cal Arts and I had all my stuff out and
3738260	3742060	normally the companies that come by are like Disney and DreamWorks and
3742660	3744920	You know big film companies like that
3746380	3749780	But who also was there was Matt Bozon at WayForward
3750780	3753300	Because WayForward is in the same city as Cal Arts
3754340	3759600	And he saw my stuff and I think he he got things going he was you know
3759600	3763300	He was a fan of my stuff and he got things going for me at WayForward
3763420	3767660	She met Jonathan Kim another Skullgirls artist while at Cal Arts and brought him into the project
3767900	3772540	The two of them as well as other creatives in their friend group ran what they characterized as an art
3772760	3778100	Collective called mecha fetus where they collaborated on various art pieces. Well, I met John
3778740	3780140	persona in
3780140	3781580	college I
3781580	3786580	Went to Cal Arts for character animation and he was in my year and we became friends super quick
3786580	3793220	And he had the idea with another friend of his to start like an art collaborative
3793860	3797220	group mecha fetus ran from their early college days in
3797500	3801900	2006 up until basically their professional careers took off and they no longer had time to work on it
3801900	3805340	I think people who have followed my work, I guess from the beginning
3806620	3810140	Know my stuff from the mecha fetus visual blog
3811220	3814980	Which was me John Kim persona
3815660	3817660	Paul Robertson
3818140	3823080	Eu03 and Brad Raffi and it was just a place where we
3823740	3825100	posted
3825100	3831300	Whatever really just it was just a place for us to post our earth that like wasn't deviant art or you know, whatever
3832020	3837340	And I think I don't know how I think it's because Paul already had a bit of a following
3838300	3841320	But people discovered that pretty quick. Yeah
3841760	3848040	And so we had like what what what time period were you doing the mecha fetus stuff mostly it was like
3849920	3852320	2006 or 7 to
3855320	3857320	Like it's sex because I don't want to say that
3857880	3862380	It's gone. Sure, or we're not gonna come back to it, but we haven't posted on it
3862440	3866160	But I mean, yeah, all of y'all are doing other things, right? Right. Yeah
3866200	3873680	The style of mecha fetus was described by Marielle as revolving around blood guts and naked girls your styles
3873960	3879320	are definitely different but there's reoccurring themes amongst all of you that being like
3880200	3881480	nudity
3881480	3886280	exposed brains and like intestines that are fun you like mix
3887400	3894680	Disgusting and sexy and cute all together. Am I right in thinking that that's kind of a unifying theme between um, I
3895280	3899000	Think that's that's most of a thing between Paul and I
3899840	3903200	We just like gross and cute things
3904880	3908640	I've always been like a fan of like horror scary stuff
3909640	3911440	and
3911440	3913400	Yeah, I mean that's that's kind of it
3913400	3915480	I just want to draw stuff that I think is cool
3915720	3921660	Mariel tells the story of how her career got started several times across these various interviews and though the story changes each time
3921700	3924700	It's mostly the same then I had my stuff at the job fair
3925260	3928700	I did not get noticed by anyone except
3929480	3935380	Family guy family guy sent me or requested like a storyboard test for me. All right
3935980	3938700	And then Matt bows on a way forward noticed my stuff
3939460	3942740	And that's actually kind of how my relationship with way forward started
3942740	3948760	She had done a bit of freelance work in video games here and there making the UI for some Barbie game and most notably making
3948760	3954160	A couple of drawings for the joke ending for Silent Hill shattered memories. My first thing was actually
3954960	3956960	Silent Hill shattered memories
3957040	3964080	Wow, which completely yeah, it came out of nowhere. Like we were you know, we had done the busy vlog for a couple years
3965000	3969280	And then I got an email from Tom hill at Konami
3970120	3972120	Asking if I could
3972400	3978420	You know do the the joke ending the UFO ending for shattered memories and I said, yeah
3979080	3986040	I'd love to but through way forward. She got her first big job in the games industry the Scott Pilgrim game. He
3986920	3990240	Asks what artwork did you work on for the Scott Pilgrim game?
3990240	3995800	Oh, I know I was forgetting something Scott Pilgrim game that you worked on what a what a beautiful piece of work that game is
3996240	4003960	He says the game is awesome in the art style rocks. So what did you do on that game? Um, I was one of the animators
4004400	4008200	I was actually only freelance on it. I worked off-site
4009600	4013060	But I did all the background and PC characters
4014120	4015280	and
4015280	4020040	I also did the title screen illustration which eventually was
4020640	4024240	Changed a bit in the final version, but I did the original of that
4024240	4024920	I
4024920	4031280	mentioned earlier in the video that the current fan narrative surrounding skullgirls is that the original creators Alex and Mike the ones who were truly
4031320	4036920	Passionate about skullgirls got screwed out of their own creation by progressives who don't give a shit about the property never worked on it
4036920	4038840	Never cared about it and now they're just ruining it
4038840	4040640	But this isn't true
4040640	4047400	Alex was another of Marielle's art friends and he brought her onto the skullgirls project before they pitched the concept to Reverge labs
4047400	4049400	I was a friend of Alex's and
4050000	4053800	In 2010, I think at the start of 2010 I started
4055160	4059880	Animating on the skullgirls just you know as one of my spare things
4059920	4064000	They started pitching it to different companies to see if anyone wanted to
4064640	4072960	Publish like pick up and fully develop skullgirls and I think we pitched it to like Ubisoft and maybe stag or something
4073560	4075560	and in the end it was
4076120	4078880	autumn autumn games who picked it up and
4079640	4085220	You know said we want to publish this game and we can fund a team develop it fully full-time
4085220	4091100	In fact Alex and Marielle were working on skullgirls before they even brought Mike on with his engine
4091380	4096660	Skullgirls started as an indie project originally as a pixel animated game in like
4097260	4098660	2004 ish
4098660	4101580	Alex was just working on it by himself at the time
4102420	4108300	And over the course of a few years and after several iterations it made the transition from being a 2d pixel game
4108620	4116140	To a 2d HD game then we had who is now our lead game designer Mike Z join the project and with him came
4116900	4119060	His own fighting game engine that he made himself
4119780	4121780	He was working on that for a long time before
4122300	4129580	Mike has been very particular about this point saying consistently that he or the rest of the team aren't the creators of skullgirls
4129980	4135540	Alex's at one point when Mike and Marielle were discussing indivisible in 2019 Marielle said this
4136180	4138180	The designer
4138260	4140260	artist on skullgirls Alex Ahad
4140980	4144820	You know was was a big part of it. He was the one that also designed all the monsters
4146620	4148620	Yeah creator of skullgirls
4149100	4151100	Yeah, so I think I think
4151220	4153380	Now this might just be me reading into it
4153380	4157540	But I feel like the tone of this exchange is Marielle downplaying Alex's involvement
4157540	4163700	Mike correcting the record and defending his friend who had left the company at this point by the way and Mariel quickly agreeing but
4163700	4166660	Rushing past the point but I could just be reading into it a little bit too much
4167100	4172400	Mariel confirmed that only the core skullgirls people from Reverge labs moved over to lab zero games
4172540	4176460	The skullgirls team has made a new studio called lab zero games
4177780	4179940	and we as a
4181140	4184540	Smaller more of like the score the core skullgirls team
4185260	4190180	We want to continue working on the game. She would later describe this as eight people in total
4190180	4194640	We have eight people in house we have four artists a programmer a designer
4195260	4202020	An art production guy and our CEO. Okay, we've got Alex Mike Marielle John Peter the unnamed CEO
4202020	4207100	In fact the way that Marielle describes him here as not a part of the creative process just the CEO
4207100	4210420	It really does sound like he just provided the initial startup capital
4210420	4214660	Like I theorized earlier Marielle describes this arrangement as not really being professional
4214660	4217620	They were just a big group of creative friends who wanted to make games together
4217980	4219980	The skullgirls team is made up of
4220380	4226400	Primarily 2d artists and animators and we worked with what we had as just a small indie team
4226400	4230740	We're just a big group of friends pretty much and in fact all throughout these videos
4231060	4236780	Marielle Alex all the artists that are interviewed they all seem to be part of some larger Southern California art scene
4236780	4242120	I actually forgot to mention in my introduction that I'm also part of a lava punch one and two and the spaceman anthology
4242120	4246380	Which are the previous books that that this group has done before and I've known them since
4246700	4248700	since my days in bow, which is basically
4249740	4253220	artist group gathering in the Bay Area Bay Area artists unite and
4253740	4257420	I was I had met them through there back in high school
4257420	4262180	So I guess I've known them for many years now speaking of that 2019 indivisible stream
4262180	4264660	There's some very interesting things going on there
4264860	4271500	Mike and Marielle are very clearly comfortable with each other acting like old friends Marielle is in the PR role in this conversation
4272060	4279580	Being diplomatic hitting talking points while Mike is this zany all-over-the-place hyper creative type with no public speaking skills
4279980	4285960	Probably the most blatant example of this dynamic is when Mike talks about why they didn't go with the epic game store for indivisible's release
4286300	4288780	What motivated your decision to sell the game where you do?
4288780	4292380	I mean we're we talk to designers now and developers so often
4292740	4297680	A major point of contention is which store front to put the game on and which service to put it out on and that seems
4297680	4299680	only likely to grow more
4299760	4303840	Contentious in the years ahead. So tell me how did you think about how to sell this game?
4303840	4305560	And sort of why did you put it out the way you did?
4305560	4310920	I mean, I guess you're referring to like steam versus epic now is kind of the discussion that we're having right?
4310920	4317560	I mean, I guess I guess for us epic came so late in the game that it just didn't really impact our decision at all
4318120	4320120	I mean it just
4320960	4324540	Some part of it was that we already had a steam version that worked right? Yeah
4325900	4327900	Yeah, so it you know
4327980	4329980	Consoles in
4330060	4335740	PC Mac Linux. Yeah was just basically it at the time, you know that we made the decision
4336420	4339680	Steam was the thing and so that's just kind of what we followed through
4340460	4342460	so we haven't been to
4348740	4350740	Know what's watching
4352140	4356300	About the epic store like that they give you information to
4357100	4359100	Their Chinese owner
4366660	4371380	Because that was a weird thing for a minute I recall sorry it was a weird thing for a minute
4371380	4377060	I have no idea whether it was actually confirmed because we didn't come out on the epic store. So yeah
4377060	4379460	I don't I don't want to I'm not trying to defend the epic store here
4379460	4383480	I'm just trying to make sure our claims do you know we're on a live stream here
4383480	4387040	So we don't we don't have the luxury of an editor. Yeah, so some have said
4389440	4396320	I think the bigger point is just that you know steam was our option when we were deciding and so that's what we just stuck
4396320	4400400	Yeah, but more interesting to me is how Mike and Mariel describe their workplace
4400400	4402680	How much do you let your staff provide creative input?
4402960	4407100	How do you organize staff input and how do you keep that input from clashing during production?
4408800	4411080	I think I think everyone has say
4413480	4419840	Yeah, that was that was exactly what I was gonna say and I'm I do not mean to speak over you sure sure
4419840	4421840	Well, I was just gonna say everyone
4421880	4427600	We encourage everyone to speak up just because I think a lot of the issues we ran into development
4427600	4429200	we were able to
4429200	4435280	Kind of like avoid or circumvent because someone spoke up and just just gave us an opinion that we weren't expecting
4435640	4438520	So we do try to encourage everyone to speak up as much as possible
4438520	4444680	But I think like Mike you and I we're both kind of like the vision holders
4445360	4448200	so we know that what we want out of the game and
4448640	4451160	And so, you know, we're always listening to feedback
4451160	4458520	But ultimately once a decision needs to be made it's gonna be made by you or I essentially we are as far as feedback goes
4459320	4463620	Completely flat and I don't want us to change that I've worked at places where it was like
4464100	4468460	You say you would say something about art and the artist would be like, well, you're not an artist
4470540	4475360	Like the artist would come to a designer and be like this parts been really frustrating like in me
4475360	4481140	Just playing it because I'm art in this part and the designer be like, yeah, well, you're not a designer. So shut up get out like
4482180	4488180	That sucks because the feedback that you get that's usually the most useful is from the people that aren't in your discipline
4488260	4495060	Right because they notice things that you are not trained or are trained to not notice anymore and like I
4495700	4501360	try to listen to absolutely everybody from everywhere at all times and then
4501820	4506500	Like the way that I put it on skull girls was I'll listen to everybody but the decision is mine
4506620	4511980	They both genuinely seem to want a flat hierarchy where everyone has an equal say as team leads
4511980	4514180	They do have to make the final choice that's inevitable
4514220	4518020	But Mike seems genuinely committed to the idea of everyone being equal
4518460	4525300	Elsewhere Mario characterized Mike as essential a talented genius that could do things by memory in a way. She'd never seen before the way
4525980	4527980	making moves for skull girls works is
4528380	4534800	That the artists kind of like all come together and brainstorm just a bunch of moves that they think would look awesome for the character
4534800	4536140	to do
4536140	4540700	Just no limits. Just anything just kind of trying to keep in mind like well she needs to punch
4540700	4543140	She needs to kick she needs some supers and you know all that stuff
4544180	4550260	and then we pass that on to Mike Mike see who's the designer of skull girls who is just
4551380	4555620	Like the brain behind everything game play related at our company
4555620	4557960	How literate is Mike in terms of animation?
4557960	4560660	Like was he able to speak to you in your language or you know what?
4560660	4567040	Yeah, that's something that I'm so grateful for in Mike is that he might not understand
4568660	4571100	Like animation terminology or
4572020	4574800	Just like all like the twelve principles and all this stuff
4574900	4579020	But he is such a good and thorough understanding of how fighting games work
4579500	4586860	That a lot of times he would help us fix our animations to make them work more like other fighting games. Yeah
4587380	4591260	Just send you like animated guests from like fighter generation. Oh my god constantly
4591580	4593200	He says, you know
4593200	4599060	I want it to work like this and it works like this because of this and this it has this many frames in it
4599060	4601300	You know, this is why it does what it does
4602180	4606060	And so much of what I learned just came from him telling me
4606500	4611180	You know, like this is X number of frames and it works because of this reason
4611940	4619420	And do that in your animation and a lot of times he's fixing the timing on my animations. Like I don't think I
4620420	4624700	Could have done any of what I did like without his input. Oh, yeah crazy
4624780	4630900	Yeah, I swear to God like the sentence that I hear most often in fighting games is alright
4630900	4632900	So here's how they do it in guilty here
4635060	4642700	It's funny because I don't know anyone else that could just rattle off exact frame counts of certain moves from some random game
4643700	4647980	And just you know, it's not even fighting games like he could do that about
4648660	4650660	You know Metroid
4650780	4655460	Any game he's passionate about he will just dissect and
4655940	4659260	Know in and out. It's really fascinating to me
4659260	4664140	This all lends weight to the claim that even though Mike was the foundation of the whole operation
4664260	4665860	Especially after the absence of Alex
4665860	4669060	He still intended to make lab zero games a worker co-op
4669200	4673580	Probably because he viewed these people as his friends and he wanted to do right by them
4673580	4679620	It just wasn't legally possible Mario's attitude towards her own art has changed over the years in 2012
4679740	4684900	She said she didn't really think about what she drew or why she simply knew that she liked girls with big boobs and gory horror
4684900	4690020	Stuff and mecha fetus was her connection to other Southern California creatives with those same tastes
4690020	4694060	Is there any reason why the mecha fetus blog is a little slow with updates?
4694380	4699500	Where can we get more regular updates on your work? I thought you had your own tumblr as well. Is that right?
4699500	4702340	Uh, yeah, I do know well
4702340	4708700	I think we were almost active on the busy blog while we were in college and since then we've had
4709180	4713740	You know jobs and we come home from our work and we're just too tired to try extra stuff
4715460	4722060	You know, it's still updated sometimes but definitely not as much as it used to and although Alex wasn't a part of mecha fetus
4722060	4723460	He shared these interests
4723460	4728860	Which is why Marielle was drawn into the skull girls project as skull girls also includes a lot of those things though toned down
4728860	4736160	Did you come up with any of the more disgusting ideas? No, I didn't actually it's it's all Alex and what's great about him is
4736960	4738440	That
4738440	4740440	Also Alex and I like the same stuff
4741120	4743320	his stuff isn't quite as is
4743880	4749600	Like brain exposed gory as I like but he just loves weird monstery
4750360	4755560	You know gross out stuff. So yeah, no, it's super cool Alex and I think pretty alike
4756160	4757480	That's great that you yeah
4757480	4763280	So many people who who get you in that way and that you have so many fans who get you as well
4763320	4766960	But when you first signed on to work on the skull girls project full-time
4766960	4771960	Did you feel like you were taking a professional risk in any way or did it just feel natural and like them?
4771960	4779320	Um, it pretty much felt like a dream come true. Like what better job could I ask for than to animate cute girls?
4780680	4787280	Marielle also mentioned that skull girls received a lot of flack back during its release that nowadays sounds very familiar
4787480	4791520	You know as soon as like our first trailer came out, you know, everyone was like, oh
4792040	4799100	Pedophile disgusting all-girls game. It's like well one. I don't know where the pedophile comment comes from because they're all girls with big
4802080	4807800	I guess Miss Fortune's boobs are medium. Yeah that pedophile in the art world
4807800	4810180	Yeah, I know it's it's stupid because in the end
4810760	4814840	Not every girl is like a sexy bombshell. I think we're actually pretty varied
4816400	4818800	But those are the characters that people remember
4819240	4821240	Um, but
4821600	4827120	You know, we we all we got a lot of negative press and stuff in the sexism and all that nonsense
4828080	4829540	but I
4829540	4836080	Feel like everyone on the team felt that we were really making something good and we were pouring our hearts into it
4836080	4841360	And we were working your asses off and we just wanted to make the best product we could boy
4841360	4846960	nothing's really changed has it calling drawings of cute women pedophilic is just as dumb today as it was back then and
4847120	4853640	Developers fear of being labeled as a sexist has only increased since 2012 but back then Mariel gave the correct answer
4853640	4858640	I'm finding more and more talking to publishers and developers that it's not that they don't want to add
4859920	4866960	More women or add more minorities and it's not that they think that minorities and women can't sell
4866960	4869960	It's that they're oftentimes afraid that they're going to be called
4870560	4874040	Sexist or racist right if they depict a woman in the wrong way
4874040	4878120	Then everyone's gonna call them sexist or if they you know, make a male character
4878120	4884320	I mean a black character with big lips and an afro then it's gonna be oh, you're you're you're racist when
4884520	4890440	We'll have big lips and afro. It's uh, it's it's limiting people's fear of racism and sexism
4890440	4895720	I feel can limit them a lot and you guys didn't have that at all. You just went for it
4896320	4898320	yeah, I I mean I
4899000	4905620	Think the way Alex thinks in creating his characters is he just wants to think you're he just wants to make what he thinks is
4905760	4913560	Super cool. He's not there's no quota to meet or you know, anything like that. He just wants to make awesome stuff
4915080	4917040	But did you ever?
4917040	4923080	When people call me racist which happens sometimes I think maybe I'm racist and I just don't know it
4923240	4928800	Who knows I have to like really scan my brain for racism that might be like planted in there
4928800	4932480	Did you ever think that maybe you were a sexist pedophile?
4933360	4934960	um
4934960	4936520	I've
4936520	4938280	Don't want to say I've thought about it
4938280	4946040	But I mean, you know it all the discussion has has made me question like well is my stuff problematic
4946560	4952960	Um, and I I think what it comes down to especially with school girls is that I
4953560	4955920	don't think that anything we've made is
4957880	4962360	Purely eye candy. I feel like every character is substantial
4963760	4970080	Like the characters that are super sexy like Sarah Bella and Valentine. It's part of their character like
4970840	4972440	Valentine in particular
4972440	4978540	She knows she's sexy. She flaunts it. It's it's part of her to be that and that's okay
4979160	4983600	That's I think that's totally fine. It's not wrong for a woman to be sexy
4983800	4988120	This is the liberal reply the sex-positive anti-piritan reply
4988120	4992120	I I feel like there's an attitude of like that every woman
4992560	4998880	Like every female character has to be like a strong independent woman and I think that's great
4998960	5003880	We do need more characters that are like that, but we also need all types of characters. We need different women
5004520	5008360	One a woman who is strong a woman who is insecure and weak
5009440	5016920	As long as I think we get variation like that's what we should be going for. Not every woman should be eye candy
5017840	5021880	Not every woman necessarily needs to be a super badass either
5022960	5027660	You know people are different and I think that's what we should be going for in our games
5027700	5033740	If only progressive creators knew this nowadays Ray Skywalker or Captain Marvel don't work because they're not real people
5033740	5041460	They're just avatars of female empowerment 2012. Mariel understood this but by 2016 Mariel's position on this topic had shifted quite a bit
5041460	5046620	When I was six, my parents got me a Genesis. Okay, and on the Genesis
5046620	5050460	I had Street Fighter 2 and then super came out and that had Kami
5051020	5056200	And I was always really bummed that Chinle was the only girl in the original and then so they introduced Kami
5056560	5060160	But my parents didn't want to buy it from me because I already had the game
5061520	5065800	So I would rent it from blockbuster over and over and over just to play as Kami
5066800	5071140	I thought she was super cool. This was when I was you know, like seven
5072400	5076920	She just seemed super cool. She seemed super strong. I
5077960	5084520	Liked her hair. I liked her moves. Just everything about her was like appealing to me for some reason Tifa was a big one
5084520	5086920	Just for some reason I was always
5088180	5090340	Attracted to like cool female characters
5092200	5096760	Which is interesting because I actually started off drawing Sonic, okay
5098360	5103840	Sonic was my life from six to twelve, but even then
5104880	5106880	You know, I always liked drawing
5107720	5112520	Sally and bunny and just like the females of the Sonic universe
5112520	5117680	I started just like getting into manga more and then that kind of like dominated most of my teens
5118880	5122640	But yeah still like throughout I was always just like attracted to
5123920	5125920	girls, yeah, and
5127720	5133120	I've only actually dated men like been in relationships with men
5134840	5137040	But I'm still like attracted to girls
5137920	5139920	it's I
5140160	5142160	Have like a weird
5142320	5149960	Relationship with my own sexuality where I've only dated men, but I don't particularly find men attractive
5149960	5158080	Yeah, it's it's kind of weird to say she is clearly hinting at the same sexual awakening and interest that she mentioned back in 2012
5158080	5163880	But the tone of her story has changed in 2012. She was more. I don't know. I just think hot chicks are cool
5163880	5167320	Look at my artwork. It's got girls at big tits while in 2016
5167360	5172920	She's more about identifying with her sexuality in what we would call nowadays a quasi political manner
5173160	5176680	She also makes the claim that she still likes all the same edgy stuff
5176680	5180680	But that she purposely tones it down because she knows she has eyes on her now
5180680	5186520	She knows that she can influence others and that the political environment in 2016 is different than what she grew up with
5186520	5188520	I like pretty girls
5188600	5193720	May or may not know that I'm also into like horror and I like gory stuff and you know all that
5193720	5195720	So
5196360	5203160	Like from the very start just being an artist like drawing was the outlet for all those things that I liked sure
5203920	5205640	and
5205640	5208600	It was like if someone told me not to draw something
5209600	5211600	Which you know has happened?
5211920	5216960	It's like well, what why wouldn't I this is how I get that stuff out of my head, right?
5218400	5221040	Like that's not to say that I don't have
5221720	5224760	Fears about putting certain works online
5226200	5232280	Like I've kind of toned down the amount of like gore kind of stuff that I post
5233200	5235200	Like I don't post that stuff as much
5237080	5241760	Like I think that's just in part like I'm aware that I have a lot more eyes on my work now, right
5241760	5247360	You know, my art is the way I want to like express certain things, but I do still have a fear of like
5247360	5249360	Oh, is this too much?
5250040	5252040	Especially now, I think
5252720	5255160	Like kind of like the culture and environment that we're in
5255160	5261480	We're very hyper aware of like the meaning like the implications of the work we put out which is good
5262040	5264800	but my personal struggle is like
5266240	5272540	When do I stop putting myself into something and start thinking about you know, what other people are seeing about me
5273140	5276620	And that's that's something I still have a hard time with in
5276900	5281920	2012 Marielle was asked about the future of her career and the answer she gave was interesting Tim Schafer
5281920	5283940	For instance, he's been in the business for so long
5283940	5289100	He's built up a huge following you can just go on Kickstarter and be like million dollars, please
5289100	5294060	I want to make a game. Do you see yourself maybe in 15 years being like million dollars?
5294060	5296320	I want to make brain naked boobs
5296920	5298520	Testons zombie
5298520	5304200	Rainbow party game and people giving you I know I'd I'd donate as much as you want for it right now
5304200	5309600	Do you would you ever see yourself being able to make the kind of games that are as weird as you can possibly get? I?
5311160	5313880	Don't know I think it's kind of tricky with I
5314760	5321320	feel like with games you have to really be conscious of the player and what the player wants which which
5322320	5328920	Isn't necessarily how it should be like I wish it could be as open as making like an independent film is
5328920	5331320	I don't think I don't know if I'd be a good game
5332400	5334400	Yeah, what makes you say that?
5334520	5337120	hmm, I don't know because I feel like it's a lot of
5338040	5344160	Like thinking about systems and and you know, where's where's the game in the game?
5344160	5348280	And I'm like, well, I want to make something that's pretty and that doesn't make for a good game
5348760	5352440	But I kind of look I am interested in it, but I feel like
5353520	5358560	There's a lot I still have to learn before I even try tackling it in 2020
5358560	5362920	Marielle states that she has no time for any of her old projects anymore and that she is getting old
5363000	5369040	Over the past couple years. I've been working on my personal stuff less and less. I don't have the time anymore
5369840	5375240	I think I'm getting old is what's happening. But yeah
5375240	5377240	You're in charge of things
5377600	5379600	Yeah, it's different like when you
5381040	5384560	You have to do that take up your entire day. Yeah
5384880	5388880	It's different when you're done with your work for the day that it used to be
5388880	5392200	This is on some level the natural progression of a successful career
5392200	5395380	You begin as the plucky energetic creative and as you move up in life
5395380	5401720	You lose that energy and end up in a more managerial role and in 2023 when she has to face that question a second time
5401720	5405120	Where do you see yourself in ten years? Her answer is very different
5405160	5409220	Where do you see yourself in ten years in the games industry?
5410800	5413600	Hmm that's a good question. Um, I
5414120	5417640	Mean, I would I would love to work on more projects like this
5417640	5423960	I do enjoy being kind of like in a leadership position, but what I really want to do is
5424520	5425600	help
5425600	5427600	bring up others
5427760	5431840	And and get them to leadership positions to be able to create their own games
5432000	5436240	Like if I do kind of go more to a management kind of position
5437080	5442240	But but if that gives me an opportunity to kind of help others bring their own ideas to life
5442600	5445260	Like that's something that I would love to see
5445880	5451600	So I definitely don't see myself like always doing all the art myself and stuff like that
5452080	5458080	I really believe in making room for for others to share their art
5459080	5460200	So
5460200	5461400	Wherever that takes me
5461400	5467200	Um, I think that's something that I would I would be excited to see passing the torch to the next generation is fine and necessary
5467200	5472600	Of course, but there's also at least from how I'm reading this the sense that she's lost what made her her
5472760	5478120	Yeah, part of that is just aging. I'm old too. I've probably lost some stuff over the years actually with me
5478120	5484100	It's more like I've gained but here's what I mean. My core interests and values remain uncompromised even after all these years
5484460	5490780	I've explored different ideas different hobbies and interests different politics, but my values have always remained the same
5490780	5492840	I'm still the same edgy 2000s era dev
5492900	5497020	This isn't stagnation because what I was back then was good and it's still good
5497060	5501860	This is the rejection of change for changes sake I feel no need to answer for anything
5501860	5507740	I've done in the past because even if it doesn't line up with modern sensibilities, it's still overwhelmingly good in short
5507740	5508820	I don't have trolls remorse
5508860	5515220	We've just spent like a half-hour watching clips of Mariel describing her career and her art and maybe it was a little bit too much
5515220	5517060	But I wanted to paint a complete picture
5517060	5522500	What's happened here isn't just that Mariel's matured and her ideas have changed over time though. That's part of it
5522500	5529540	It's also that like Atrox from earlier Mariel seems to have not trolls remorse, but sexy remorse in 2012
5529540	5534140	She was unapologetically sexual open about her attraction to other women proud and direct in
5534820	5541020	2016 she claims to still feel that way but was afraid of the current political paradigm canceling her for being misogynistic in
5541740	5546220	2023 all traces of that former Mariel is gone and she has become the Puritan the
5546260	5549020	Canceller that she once feared and if you want proof of that
5549020	5553700	All you have to do is go back and see how she shit on Mike her friend for over a decade for the crime of
5553900	5559620	Engaging with her on the terms. She established or hell how about this, you know Philia the skullgirls character
5559620	5561700	That was the most censored in that 2023 update
5562100	5568560	Mariel was the one who did those initial animations in 2010. I think at the start of 2010 I started
5569940	5574620	Animating on the skullgirls just you know as one of my spare things
5575860	5577140	and
5577140	5583900	We we were focusing on Philia who was the first character and we we pretty much almost finished her
5584140	5584640	Yes
5584640	5586640	That character was her baby
5586680	5591360	Mariel drew the panty shots that became iconic of the game and his future club creative director
5591440	5593680	Mariel greenlit the censoring of her own work
5593840	5600160	There is this narrative among hardcore skullgirls fans and terminally online culture warriors that the skullgirls
5600360	5607200	censorship story is one of new progressive corpora types coming in kicking out the original creators who were based and waifu pilled
5607360	5613860	Updating it for modern sensibilities regardless of the desires those original creators and all the fans who don't like the changes are just racist
5613900	5615660	Alt-right fascist gamer Gators
5615660	5620580	It's an appealing story because that actually has happened before but it doesn't quite fit this time
5620580	5625800	The majority of the original team that worked on skullgirls back in the day are still there at future club
5625800	5631620	And this is a case of them ruining their own legacy in order to appeal to the new progressive standard that they either feel
5631760	5636620	Browbeat into adhering to or that they genuinely believe in themselves and I personally think it's the latter
5636820	5643700	What's going on with Mariel Cartwright specifically is what I would like to dub Lindsay Ellis syndrome where you fear the puritanical nature
5643900	5650220	Of the audience you've cultivated even as you yourself become more and more like them when Mariel stated that she fears her old
5650220	5655780	Artwork being used one day to cancel her those words sound like they could have come directly from the nostalgia chicks mouth
5655860	5656420	Yeah
5656420	5664020	Like I haven't been posting like the weird stuff the weird and gory stuff recently because I've honestly been scared of the backlash
5665020	5670820	You know, I've now seen how people will try to dig up stuff about you and post it
5670860	5672860	Like, you know, here's something you did in
5673220	5675220	2006 let's see it
5675220	5681220	Destroy you because you know the same person you're the same person you were in 2006 and it's like it's not the case people are
5681220	5683220	changing constantly
5683220	5684480	but
5684480	5691900	You know because I'm now scared of those kind of people coming up from the fucking depths of hell to destroy me
5692540	5693700	I
5693700	5697100	Haven't been posting that kind of work in 2012
5697100	5702460	She simply wanted to create artwork that was authentically her and to hell with those who didn't approve for political reasons by
5702740	5706180	2016 she was afraid of that 2012 attitude coming back to bite her in the ass
5706380	5710060	Even as she still ultimately believed in it and by 2023
5710140	5715720	She has absolutely morphed into the type of person who would have canceled her past self for saying the word retarded
5716080	5721440	But other than that I hadn't really done like a full comic by myself other than
5723080	5725080	Like retarded
5725440	5730400	While researching all of this I went to go check out whatever remnants of that mecha fetus thing might still exist online
5730400	5733080	And I quickly found this page a lost relic in
5733720	5740080	2009 our art collective mecha fetus put together a little art book that we sold at anime Expo the mecha fetus site is unfortunately down
5740080	5746280	But some of the artwork now lives on in a PDF you can download for free 18 plus only please features nudity
5746280	5750280	Gore and some jokes that have not aged. Well, you've been warned. All right
5750280	5756680	Well, even though it says it's free the button doesn't work unless I put something in so I guess I'll put in one cent
5756720	5758980	There's no PayPal. I got I got to use a credit card
5760080	5767020	Do I really want to give Mariel my real-life information? Oh god. Well if something weird happens to my credit card
5767020	5769900	I guess I know who did it. All right things I do for a video
5770340	5774580	Wait a minute. The amount must be 99 cents. You said it was free
5774820	5779800	Okay, one dollar Jesus when you guys toss me a $1 super chat at some point
5779800	5781980	I hate the idea of actually giving her some of my money
5781980	5787160	But I guess that means I'm giving her yours instead and here we go. I've got the PDF mecha fetus
5787660	5793600	2009 nice girls nice cats. It is a lot of overly sexualized ridiculous drawings
5793760	5796760	Honestly the kind of stuff that she's still post nowadays on her private accounts
5796760	5800560	But I want to see what she's referring to when she says jokes that haven't aged. Well. Oh, yeah
5800560	5802080	I definitely got a sense for this
5802080	5810120	This is a picture of a naked zombie girl getting seppuku and her blood fountaining out onto a mecha fetus a robot fetus
5810120	5816000	Well on the other side, there's an angel woman who's squeezing her tits together and spraying milk onto the same fetus
5816000	5821040	I mean, it's ridiculous and goofy and stupid but definitely not you too safe. Oh, I think I found it
5821040	5822760	This is a giant
5822760	5823500	bloodied
5823500	5829860	futanari woman with like a four-foot cock and a whole bunch of women are like climbing on it and dancing around it while it
5830120	5834720	Ejaculates a huge rainbow, but also she has a swastika carved into her tits
5835920	5840440	This is so stupid and ridiculous. It really is funny artwork, but man
5840440	5843880	This is not the kind of thing that a 2023 progressive would do
5843880	5847640	I'm not bringing this up to cancel Mariel just like I didn't with Atrux earlier
5847640	5850680	It's to point out that all of these people have followed a similar path
5851000	5854480	Despite all of their claims to be artists who are creating what is authentically them
5854480	5859400	They nonetheless move and bend with the wind when being edgy and sexual was popular and progressive
5859400	5864240	They were edgy and sexual when the political paradigm moved on they also moved on but only kinda
5864280	5869340	These people will still make and like sexual art on their personal accounts while at the same time
5869640	5875480	Chastising you for your own sexual expression because they're progressive and sex-positive while you're a fetishizer and an exploiter
5875640	5881920	Once again, we come face to face with safe horny. There's a hard truth here that I've personally had to learn the hard way
5881920	5884320	I think Mike might be learning it the hard way, too
5884440	5890840	when you look at Mariel and Alex and all these other people in their Southern California art clique when you look at other similar cliques in
5890840	5896360	Twitch streaming or youtubing speedrunning indie game development any sort of creative field that is relatively new
5896360	5899460	You can see the beginnings of class divide in those cliques
5899600	5904820	I'm not gonna sit here and say that Mariel is the haves and the artist whose stuff never takes off as the have-nots
5905060	5908260	Mariel's not a capitalist bourgeois oppressor or any nonsense like that
5908380	5912340	But these are all people who know each other they live in one of the most affluent areas of the world
5912340	5917900	They have connections. They wear their politics on their sleeve. Their groups are called collectives or cooperatives for a reason
5917900	5922100	They want a bit of that commune aesthetic. We are feature club and we are
5923140	5929020	cooperatively owned and run game company everyone on the team has equal ownership and
5929460	5936180	Voting power and to determine sort of how the studios run and that was really something that was really really important to us and
5936380	5941540	Frankly people like you or I were just not part of the club even if we became successful
5941540	5944780	I remember talking to I think it was it's a Gundam about this in private
5944780	5948140	He's got a really successful channel, but he's still on the outside of the YouTube game
5948140	5954820	He's still somebody that the equivalent of Mariel in a lefty youtuber clique would look down on it's true that Mariel got to where she
5954900	5956900	Was based off of her own talent and hard work
5956980	5963860	She is truly a successful artist, but she's also physically attractive. She has the right politics. She lives in the right place
5963860	5967540	She knows the right people if I were an equally skilled artist as her
5967540	5973700	I still wouldn't have her career because I'm not her the socialist analysis of the state of affairs would be to consider the system
5973860	5979680	Oppressive and work towards its destruction, but I'm not a fucking retard and also I don't want to destroy what they've built for themselves
5979680	5983760	I don't want to be a part of it. The actual solution is to build your own
5984280	5986440	institutions outside of their control in
5986820	5992360	Locations that they ignore and with people they've cast out and of course you gate keep it from them
5992360	5997880	A lot of the youtubers that I know personally we've all learned this lesson the hard way and I hope Mike is learning it too
5998320	5999560	part 6
5999560	6005760	Future Club in the court documents Mariel and Francesca exclaim that their company doesn't need to be about fighting games anymore
6005760	6010280	They can do whatever they want and there are other stories that they want to tell that are slower and more thoughtful
6010360	6017560	You know walking simulators, I guess they reiterated the sentiment during a segment in the progressive gaming expo future of play
6033880	6038440	Mariel mentioned back in 2012 much of a fan of clock tower that she is, you know that SNES horror game
6038640	6041700	I would really love to work on a survival horror game
6042800	6048540	I think it'd be kind of hard because right now my skills are 2d oriented
6049640	6051640	and I think
6051920	6058040	It's kind of easier to get like a survival horror thing across in a 3d environment though. My favorite
6059000	6065320	Survival horror game is the first clock tower. Oh, yeah, which which is a 2d, you know point-and-click
6065320	6067320	So
6067640	6069040	I don't know
6069040	6074520	But I guess you know that that would be my dream project and I guess it would star a girl
6075040	6079320	Well in 2023, she's the lead on the clock tower remake. Give us the lowdown
6080120	6082000	Why clock tower?
6082000	6088680	Yeah, so I think something that way forward and limited run have been really interested in doing
6089240	6091240	over the past few years is
6091440	6092600	kind of
6092600	6097520	Finding these hidden gem games that haven't seen Western release
6098600	6104880	So I think clock tower fits exactly that criteria where clock tower is a game that has a really
6105280	6109480	Great, like dedicated fan base the original Super Nintendo game, which is my favorite
6110200	6112920	Never got a Western release or an official translation
6113040	6118520	So it seemed like the perfect game to kind of reintroduce to people kind of bring back
6119040	6120720	This brand and
6120720	6123800	You know just just share with the world like how great this game is
6124200	6132120	So it seems like she's successfully managed to make that shift those slower more intimate stories while still doing something her younger self truly
6132120	6133680	Desired which is to her credit
6133680	6136480	But my analysis of the court documents seems to be correct
6136800	6141460	Marielle and Francesca and the rest of the future clubbers just seemed to be over and done with skull girls
6141460	6145880	But it's probably the only lifeline they have right now. It's making them some money though
6145880	6151880	I'd guess less now since the censorship controversy has tanked their public image, but I think they no longer care about the property
6151960	6157280	Here's what I think happened on the business side of things when Marielle and Mike gave that indivisible GDC talk
6157280	6162760	They both described skull girls like it was over. It was a finished project indivisible was their next big thing
6162760	6169080	We were kind of coming off of finishing all the skull girls DLC that we did which we also crowdfunded on Indiegogo
6169720	6172880	So we would how many characters did we release for skull girls?
6176400	6180000	Okay, so so we put out six DLC characters for skull girls
6184920	6187720	And and once we finished that, you know
6187720	6190840	We started looking ahead and thinking about our next project
6191000	6194520	This explains why skull girls was getting little to no updates during this time, by the way
6194520	6195680	The team was just done with it
6195680	6199760	But after the implosion of lab zero games and the creation of future club
6199920	6203720	I think Marielle and Francesca realized just how fucked they were
6203900	6208200	The only contract they could secure was with autumn games for more skull girl stuff
6208200	6212040	Which is why even as Marielle and Francesca talk a big game about new projects
6212040	6215280	The only thing they did for like three years was try to revive skull girls
6215280	6220200	The only property of note they can get their hands on if they were going to be able to move on and do those future
6220200	6224760	Games they need to milk that old skull girls legacy as much as possible to me
6224760	6227720	It seems like this is probably what drove the censorship in the first place
6227840	6233560	They thought it would boost popularity and hopefully sales enough in the short term just to get a few more dollars out of it
6233560	6235520	While their real priorities lie elsewhere
6235520	6241440	Additionally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention this plus I spent like 12 hours researching it and I got to get something out of
6241440	6244280	That time even if it's only one final paragraph at the end of the video
6244280	6247380	But it seems like future club is actually a real worker co-op
6247640	6251040	Marielle and Francesca founded it in Colorado as a B corporation
6251040	6255160	Which is a corporate status that only some states have a public benefit corporation
6255160	6259080	Which allows them to pursue profit but not have a strict fiduciary duty to shareholders
6259080	6263500	They can instead also pursue a declared public good separate from profit
6263640	6269880	This basically gave them the legal leeway to be worker owned right from the beginning instead of trying to turn a normal for-profit
6269960	6277240	Corporation into a worker co-op future club, Colorado a b-corp shell company owns a separate company future club, California
6277240	6281960	Which is a normal corporation, which they all work for however due to the nature of American business law
6282080	6288000	The worker co-op status is if I'm reading this gobbledygook right and I might not be at the whim of Marielle and Francesca
6288240	6293200	Future Club's founding documents outline that all company shares are pegged at a value of one cent
6293200	6298540	one share is given to each employee upon the completion of their probationary period and that the company itself has
6298920	6304780	1,000 shares the vast majority of which are held by the company and handed out by executives to the employees
6305200	6309820	Even though everyone has one share Marielle and Francesca control the remaining shares
6309820	6314820	So it might be possible for them to pull some legal fuckery if they wanted to and just take over the company
6314820	6318500	I don't know though. I'm no expert in law from my layman's perspective
6318500	6324740	It does look like future club is at least a real attempt at a worker co-op and that American law might be unsuited for it
6324740	6330560	I'm not sure. So that is everything to me. It seems like Marielle Cartwright is a snake
6330740	6335100	She's not a fake gamer girl or some new progressive face coming into skull girls to fuck it up
6335260	6339420	That part of the fan narrative is incorrect, but that doesn't mean that she's innocent
6339660	6343140	For all of Mike's I'm onts faults and there are many of them don't get me wrong
6343540	6346700	Marielle seems like a person who corrupted this friend group from the inside out
6346920	6349460	She blamed others for actions that she committed herself
6349980	6354240	Including workplace sexual harassment and expressed fears that she would eventually be discovered for it
6354340	6359340	She genuinely contributed to a wonderful game in skull girls using her own incredible talents
6359340	6363740	But she then used that leverage to force everybody else out of the project and kept it for herself
6364060	6366820	Only to exploit it to springboard her career in a different direction
6367180	6370100	She betrayed her friends people she knew for years in
6370300	6374940	Mike's case being extremely close to him for a decade and then in just a matter of weeks
6375220	6381100	Pulled a 180 and viewed him as her worst enemy that decade of friendship meant nothing. She had no compassion
6381380	6386460	She knew the claims against him were false and she pushed them anyway because she knew it would help her career
6386580	6391300	She didn't even really care if he got saddled with all that debt and in the progressive point of view
6391300	6396040	At least everything is forgiven because she is a minority woman in game development who is harassed by a white male
6396200	6402880	Because he did the same shit to her that she did to him only she is attractive and popular while he is autistic and awkward
6402880	6409800	I personally believe that despite Mike's own faults a lot of the flak he receives nowadays is basically just out of spite
6410040	6414080	Remember modus games the company run by the woman CEO who decided to give Mike another chance
6414240	6417240	She said that his work has been truly genius level stuff
6417240	6422960	He is an inspired master of his craft, but also that his personal behavior at her company has been perfect
6423000	6429280	She was not willing to trade genius level work for bad behavior and she hasn't had to Mike's direct supervisor
6429320	6434920	Deagle legacy's art director has said the same thing but in that PC gamer article about the game
6434920	6440360	They also reached out to future club employees and printed the opinion of an anonymous former co-worker of Mike's
6440600	6446840	When I heard that modus was going to work with him. I was like that's disgusting. They're disgusting. It's disgusting
6446840	6450340	They'd work with him because they clearly don't care about female game developers
6450340	6455500	The public record was there of his continued harassment of two ex co-workers. We don't know who this is
6455500	6456180	It's anonymous
6456180	6462860	but they seem to believe that despite Mike's good behavior at modus games his ongoing lawsuit proves that he hasn't truly changed and that if
6462860	6466180	Mike were actually remorseful. He wouldn't be fighting back in court
6466180	6468460	He would just be accepting whatever legal punishment
6468740	6473740	Mariel and Francesca wish to inflict on him having read all the court documents and watched all the interviews
6473740	6478540	I personally believe that this anonymous source from future club is probably Mariel herself
6478580	6484700	She is the only one of the former staff who exhibited such visceral hatred of Mike and if I were to do some armchair
6485140	6487200	Psychologizing I think that by 2023
6487220	6494580	She still holds this visceral hatred because she knows she backstabbed a close friend of hers and she needs to justify it to herself
6494580	6498180	On the extreme off chance that you're watching this Mariel
6498180	6501760	I just want you to know that tiny voice that you can never seem to get rid of completely
6501860	6506460	lingering in the back of your mind in the middle of the night telling you that what you did was wrong and you keep
6506540	6514640	Bearing it with more and more hatred more justifications new projects new public statements, whatever but it never seems to go away. It's correct
6520700	6522200	The skull girls team
6522200	6528820	Predicted that the narrative surrounding future club would be that they bullied Mike out of his company that they destroyed an innocent man for simply
6528820	6535420	Being kind of weird and that is exactly what the narrative surrounding future club should be. I hope Mike wins in court
6536500	6542700	That's it. That's the end of the video guys. Thanks very much for watching if you couldn't tell this was a lot of work
6542700	6546920	I hope you enjoyed it Naomi my girlfriend and Dave my editor doing a few
6547040	6552120	Jokey voices for some of the characters in this story if you want me to keep using their incredible talents like this
6552120	6555360	Let me know in the comments. I guess I just decided to try it on a whim additionally
6555360	6559640	Yes, I do know about technicals video. He got it out first and it was a very good video
6559640	6560700	It's certainly worth watching
6560700	6566180	I went over a few things that he didn't but also he got that exclusive word from Kim McCaskill
6566220	6567940	He emailed her and got her comment on the story
6567940	6570380	I could have put that in my video, but I didn't want to steal his work
6570380	6574900	It just didn't seem right. So you should go and watch his stuff too. Why not? Anyway, I know this took forever
6575160	6579320	Thanks for sticking by me. I will see you guys next time. I love you
