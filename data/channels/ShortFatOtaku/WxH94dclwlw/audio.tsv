0	7360	The Patreon Purge Everyone remembers the Patreon Purge, right?
7360	10480	I did a series of videos on it back in the day, go check them out.
10480	16800	TLDR is, in 2017, Jack Conte published a video about what he called Manifest Observable Behavior
16800	20680	as justification for why he banned Lauren Southern's Patreon account, costing her
20680	21680	quite a bit of money.
21680	24860	Southern was involved in a controversy in Europe, where she was in a boat attempting
24860	28080	to block an Italian search and rescue mission in the Mediterranean Sea.
28080	32140	He was campaigning against the flow of migrants into Europe at that time, and viewed the search
32140	36220	and rescue operation as connected to the steady movement of refugees by water from Africa
36220	37560	and the Middle East to Europe.
37560	40980	I'm not here to talk about that controversy today, I don't know enough about it, frankly.
40980	45920	But I do know that Patreon interpreted the event as likely to cause loss of life, recognized
45920	50100	that their funding helped her perform those actions, and so they banned her from receiving
50100	52240	any further funding on Patreon.
52240	55200	As Jack said, Manifest Observable Behavior.
55460	59700	According to him, it was not any sort of hateful rhetoric that got Lauren Southern banned,
59700	62100	but rather what she did in real life.
62100	68280	A year later, in 2018, Patreon violated this Manifest Observable Behavior rule by banning
68280	72140	Sargon of Akkad from its platform, not for anything he did in real life, not for anything
72140	76440	he did on his YouTube channel, not for anything he did on Patreon, but for dropping the gamer
76440	78760	words as a guest on another person's channel.
78760	82060	You would really have to go and search it out to even know that it happened, as the
82060	85980	channel that it happened on was extremely small, and in fact that's what happened.
85980	89500	Here's some deep lore that's been lost to time, and unfortunately I can't corroborate
89500	93700	it anymore since my old Twitter DMs are gone, but I have it on first-hand knowledge that
93700	96540	it was Ethan Ralph's community that mass-reported him.
96540	98920	But nonetheless, the message from Patreon was clear.
98920	103900	Their terms of service extends not only over their platform or your channel, but over reality
103900	104900	itself.
104900	107760	If you've got a Patreon and you jokingly say some slurs with your friends, you'd
107760	111060	better hope nobody's recording that shit, because it's against Patreon's terms of
111060	112060	service.
112060	116180	Patreon banning for off-platform behavior opened the floodgates for other big tech sites
116180	121060	to do the same, and nowadays it's common and even expected for YouTube, Twitter, Twitch,
121060	124420	and Facebook to ban you for whatever they like, regardless of whether or not it actually
124420	126660	breaks the terms of service you agreed to.
126660	130340	And since the Patreon purge, other crowdfunding sites have followed suit.
130340	134740	Everybody points to Kickstarter as a decent crowdfunding platform, since it famously allowed
134740	139860	the studio fowl porn game Subverse to reach full funding, despite Tim Pool's protests.
139860	141900	But porn on Kickstarter is still a roll of the dice.
141900	146380	The Japanese doujin creator Push Publications has had multiple of their hentai projects
146380	149620	canceled by Kickstarter, with Kickstarter's official reply being,
149620	152620	Our rules strictly prohibit explicit pornographic content.
152620	156660	And further, our payment processor, that's Stripe by the way, does not allow pornographic
156660	157660	projects.
157660	162740	This is clearly a lie, because other Push projects have received full funding on Kickstarter,
162740	164820	as well as many other pornographic projects.
164820	167940	It just seems to be completely arbitrary whether or not something gets banned.
168020	171380	You'd think they'd have the manpower to manually review every project and figure this
171380	172380	shit out.
172380	174260	I guess that's what you get for using unionized workers.
174260	178900	In fact, just a few months after unionizing, Kickstarter had to lay off 40% of its workforce
178900	180140	in order to make the budget work.
180140	181580	It's not just porn though.
181580	186340	Mike Miller of Lone Star Comics tried to get his graphic novel, Lone Star, funded on
186340	187340	Kickstarter.
187340	188340	Kickstarter sent him an email stating,
188340	192020	As a public benefit corporation committed to fighting inequality and creating a more
192020	195980	equitable world, Kickstarter does not allow discrimination, subjugation, or intolerance
195980	197540	towards marginalized groups.
197540	202220	The comic's objectionable content was that the hero, Lone Star, was fighting members
202220	204820	of the Central American criminal organization MS-13.
204820	209420	Now, I don't know about you, but it seems like what naturally follows from Kickstarter's
209420	214580	implication that the comic is racist, is that violent MS-13 marauders are somehow representative
214580	216300	of the average Latino individual.
216300	221020	Either Kickstarter is shockingly racist themselves, or they're actually carrying water for a
221020	222580	raping murderous cartel.
222580	226500	There's other examples of Kickstarter behaving this way, like them removing a page for funding
226500	230180	a pro-life abortion documentary, or the large number of comics that have been rejected for
230180	231820	vague, hand-waved reasons.
231820	235380	But let's not get too bogged down, Kickstarter's competitors are just as bad.
235380	239460	The owner of the Parkside Cafe in Birmingham, Alabama found himself getting canceled for
239460	243580	his anti-George Floyd views, where he notably called Floyd a thug.
243580	246980	Candace Owens decided to start up a GoFundMe for the business, but GoFundMe pulled the
246980	247980	plug on it.
247980	251500	Along with Owens' entire GoFundMe account and any other pages connected to it, for her
251500	255880	support of hate, violence, harassment, bullying, discrimination, terrorism, or intolerance
255880	260400	of any kind, a different GoFundMe page attempted to raise the necessary amount to pay for a
260400	262680	recount during the 2020 election.
262680	265800	GoFundMe claimed that the page was spreading misinformation about the election, while Matt
265800	269680	Brainerd, the Trump staffer who created it, claimed that GoFundMe was interfering in the
269680	271840	electoral process by deplatforming him.
271840	275940	Regardless of how you feel about either of these events, George Floyd, or the 2020 election,
275940	280620	it's not hard to see that these moves by GoFundMe are taken in the context of supporting a prevailing
280620	284160	cultural narrative that extends far beyond their company.
284160	287480	GoFundMe's job isn't to pass judgment on whether or not the election was fraudulent,
287480	291040	or whether or not George Floyd was murdered, but rather than remain neutral, they have
291040	295240	accepted one narrative as fact and called its opposition misinformation, even though
295240	297960	many of their users actively disagree with them.
297960	301200	Indiegogo is much the same way, though at least that brought us Lightbringer.
301200	305040	Bitchute's attempt to fund an alternative comment plugin to Discus was removed from
305040	306720	Indiegogo for no reason whatsoever.
306720	311400	Same with Althaven, a QAnon-centric superhero comic, though that does actually sound pretty
311400	312400	cringe.
312400	314480	For examples all day, but the point remains clear.
314480	318320	Rather than remain neutral platforms, pretty much every crowdfunding site with the exception
318320	322480	of Subscribestar, and don't forget to go to Subscribestar.com and get yourself into the
322480	327120	$5 club and my Discord, kids, have all decided to take blatantly political stances on how
327120	331680	their services are used, and what they deplatform in the name of safety or misinformation.
331680	332680	And you know what?
332680	335680	Just for the sake of argument, let's give them the biggest possible benefit of the doubt.
335680	339400	Let's accept the George Floyd deplatforming because Floyd did die in police custody, making
339400	340960	the police ultimately responsible.
340960	344240	Let's accept the election one because every investigation into the events surrounding
344240	345920	the election has turned up nothing.
345920	348740	Let's accept the Lauren Southern thing because she impeded a search and rescue.
348740	351900	Let's accept the QAnon comic one because, well, QAnon.
351900	355160	You might disagree with their politics, but they are still internally consistent.
355160	358320	They have decided on which narrative is the truth, and yeah, they shouldn't do that,
358320	361900	but now that we're at that point, it's reasonable to expect them to apply their terms
361900	364220	of service equally within this framework.
364220	367620	Even giving them this benefit of the doubt, though, these platforms almost always end
367620	371300	up being scumfuck pieces of shit because they don't actually apply their terms of
371300	373120	service equally within this framework.
373120	374620	Here is an excellent example.
374620	378380	GoFundMe took down a number of campaigns for Kyle Rittenhouse's defense after the Kenosha
378380	379380	Riots.
379380	381060	Yes, believe it or not, that video's still coming.
381060	385900	And after Kyle got his not guilty verdict, GoFundMe reversed that stance, stating that
385900	389300	while their terms of service doesn't allow for the raising of funds with the defense
389300	392420	of somebody charged with a violent crime, once that person is acquitted, it's fair
392420	393420	game again.
393420	394420	That seems alright to me.
394420	397580	The problem is, GoFundMe doesn't actually apply this policy evenly.
397580	399740	Instead, they apply it with a political bias.
399740	405140	Brandon Lee Pack, an Antifa rioter, has been convicted and sentenced to nine years in prison
405140	410660	for throwing rocks, bricks, and fireworks at police during a BLM event in May of 2020,
410660	415540	causing 21 officers to suffer burns, permanent hearing loss, one broken foot, and other injuries.
415540	420100	His charges include aggravated riot, vandalism, breaking and entering, and felonious assault.
420100	421980	His bail was raised on GoFundMe.
421980	426580	There's also the case of GoFundMe deleting a black Trump supporters fundraiser for bulletproof
426580	429860	vests while allowing an identical fundraiser for Antifa's vest to remain up.
429860	430860	No, really.
430860	435620	Look, he used the exact same language as the Antifa GoFundMe page, but only his was locked.
435620	438820	The creator was told it would be reviewed if he produced clarification surrounding the
438820	442260	use of funds, as well as receipts of purchases, which he did provide.
442260	445700	GoFundMe went silent for a week, and when the creator emailed them asking them what
445700	448340	the holdup was, he was quickly banned from the site.
448340	453220	Hell, the event that sparked the Kenosha Riots, the completely 100% fucking justified
453220	456780	shooting of Jacob Blake, where Blake was in the middle of abducting kids, getting into
456780	460580	a vehicle with a knife in hand after assaulting the mother, whom he had sexually assaulted
460580	464260	in the past, and he was shot in the back in order to stop him after tasering him had failed?
464260	465740	Yeah, fuck this guy, he's a piece of shit.
465740	470820	Well, his GoFundMe page is still up, 18 months later, with 2.3 million dollars already donated.
470820	475360	The page's description is ambiguous about Blake's own crimes, mostly focusing on his
475360	480400	kids and his medical recovery, but it is nonetheless called justice for Jacob Blake,
480400	485280	noting that part of the proceeds will go to, the deliberately vague, assisting our family
485280	489000	in the days to come, which could mean anything, including legal defenses.
489000	493780	I guarantee you, prior to Kyle Rittenhouse's acquittal, if any GoFundMe popped up talking
493780	497720	about funding Kyle's mental health treatment or something, while not mentioning the trial
497720	500500	expenses at all, it would still have been taken down.
500500	501840	You know it, and I know it.
501840	505360	These platforms have an obvious bias when it comes to who they fund and why.
505360	509440	They'll have some perfectly reasonable restrictions on not funding people for certain legal reasons,
509440	512260	but then completely throw these away when the politics have flipped.
512260	516040	The more normie objections regarding fundraising platforms generally revolve around two critiques.
516040	519760	One, that big game companies use them when they've clearly got the money to pay for
519760	523940	a game themselves, like with Shenmue 3 or the wonderful 101 Switch port, which came
523940	527020	out looking awful, how the hell did you manage that, it was a Wii U game.
527020	530620	And two, that people just take money and run, whether that be for scam products that never
530620	534540	see the light of day, video game projects that become vaporware, or YouTubers who continue
534540	536320	to take payouts while producing nothing at all.
536320	538340	And all of these fundraising campaigns?
538340	539340	The scam products?
539340	540340	The failed games?
540340	541540	The lazy YouTubers?
541540	542540	They never get cancelled.
542540	545540	But if you disagree with the politics of the company, your ass is grass, son.
545540	546540	Let me repeat it.
546540	550100	To these guys, writing about thieves in a comic book is worse than being a thief in
550100	551460	real fucking life.
551460	553540	As always, there are alt-tech alternatives.
553540	555820	SubscribeStar works wonders as a Patreon alternative.
555820	559740	GiveSendGo is pretty good for single large fundraisers, for projects that would normally
559740	564740	use Kickstarter, Indiegogo, or GoFundMe, though it did recently suffer a data breach, revealing
564740	567700	the names of the anonymous donors to Kyle Rittenhouse that use the platform.
567700	571540	But as always, people reroute around monopolies and tyrannical behavior all the time.
571540	575660	The philosophical problem underpinning all of this, though, is the attitudes of these
575660	576660	companies.
576660	580100	As I previously discussed during the Patreon purge, Patreon's stance is that it funds
580100	583840	the creative class, and that if you're a creator using its platform, you should be
583840	587900	lucky they don't contractually own your content or your business, though they have
587900	590580	been slowly moving in that direction over the years since.
590580	594980	For example, the Patreon merch options gives them exclusive ownership over any merch and
594980	597780	branding used on it should you decide to go with them for your merch.
597780	601580	However, the reality is, Patreon does not fund the creative class.
601580	603220	The fans of those creators do.
603220	607220	Patreon is a business that handles the money exchange between audience and creator, and
607220	610020	provides convenience in exchange for a skim off the top.
610020	614220	PayPal, at this point, has its own recurring monthly donation button too, but Patreon bundles
614220	616740	all of your donations into one convenient charge.
616740	619260	And yes, PayPal also has its own problems with the platforming.
619260	622840	The point is, though, that the people at Patreon have a completely different view of their
622840	625940	service than the people who actually use that service.
625940	630680	On some level, Patreon believes that it employs creators and that it pays them a monthly check,
630680	631680	but it doesn't.
631680	632680	It facilitates payments.
632680	633680	It's not an employer.
633680	638180	And the language used at Patreon is also used at Kickstarter, GoFundMe, and Indiegogo.
638180	640780	They all view themselves as something more than they are.
640780	645460	They all believe that facilitating money-changing hands should give them some kind of stake
645460	646940	in the creators that use them.
646940	650820	And they're all making these slow but steady steps to position themselves as the owners
650820	653780	of the projects they fund and the employer of the creators who use them.
653780	657020	That's why they think it's no big deal to just behave the way that they do.
657020	660260	After all, all of us content creators are just going to be their employees one day anyway.
660260	662980	Without any benefits of actually being employed, of course.
662980	666460	YouTube and Twitch, in their own way, also talk about creators like this too.
666460	669140	And they are, as well, slowly moving in this direction.
669140	673640	The roadblock in the way of their plans, frankly, is the massive number of creators who still
673640	678240	sit on old contracts in perpetuity with places like Twitch or Patreon, where it's still
678240	681840	enshrined that the creators own the IP, not the platforms.
681840	683800	And how ridiculous would it be if it were reversed?
683800	687080	Should my phone company own my business if I do business over the phone?
687080	688080	It's stupid.
688080	690760	Yes, it's shitty that people get to platform from payment processors.
690760	693840	Yes, we should be using alternatives as much as possible.
693840	695720	But I want you to bookmark this video.
695720	698960	Within a decade, and likely a lot sooner, unless something major changes, we will see
698960	702340	a very strong public push from all of these platforms.
702340	706340	We will see the mask come off, where they attempt to rearrange their relationship with
706340	710860	content creators such that creators lose all ownership of their operations in exchange
710860	712420	for the privilege of crowdfunding.
712420	713540	I'm calling it now.
713540	716440	This happened with multi-channel networks on YouTube 10 years ago.
716440	718780	Why do you think Yahtzee is still with The Escapist?
718780	721300	Why do you think Doug Walker still works for Mike Michaud?
721300	724100	Why do you think Machinima had the reputation that it did?
724100	728100	If you're a creator and you're not using an alternative crowdfunding source, you're basically
728100	729660	putting the nails in your own coffin.
