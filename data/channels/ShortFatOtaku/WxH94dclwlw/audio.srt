1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
The Patreon Purge Everyone remembers the Patreon Purge, right?

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,480
I did a series of videos on it back in the day, go check them out.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,800
TLDR is, in 2017, Jack Conte published a video about what he called Manifest Observable Behavior

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,680
as justification for why he banned Lauren Southern's Patreon account, costing her

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,680
quite a bit of money.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,860
Southern was involved in a controversy in Europe, where she was in a boat attempting

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,080
to block an Italian search and rescue mission in the Mediterranean Sea.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,140
He was campaigning against the flow of migrants into Europe at that time, and viewed the search

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,220
and rescue operation as connected to the steady movement of refugees by water from Africa

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,560
and the Middle East to Europe.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,980
I'm not here to talk about that controversy today, I don't know enough about it, frankly.

12
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,920
But I do know that Patreon interpreted the event as likely to cause loss of life, recognized

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,100
that their funding helped her perform those actions, and so they banned her from receiving

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,240
any further funding on Patreon.

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,200
As Jack said, Manifest Observable Behavior.

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,700
According to him, it was not any sort of hateful rhetoric that got Lauren Southern banned,

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,100
but rather what she did in real life.

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,280
A year later, in 2018, Patreon violated this Manifest Observable Behavior rule by banning

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,140
Sargon of Akkad from its platform, not for anything he did in real life, not for anything

20
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,440
he did on his YouTube channel, not for anything he did on Patreon, but for dropping the gamer

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,760
words as a guest on another person's channel.

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,060
You would really have to go and search it out to even know that it happened, as the

23
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,980
channel that it happened on was extremely small, and in fact that's what happened.

24
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,500
Here's some deep lore that's been lost to time, and unfortunately I can't corroborate

25
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,700
it anymore since my old Twitter DMs are gone, but I have it on first-hand knowledge that

26
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,540
it was Ethan Ralph's community that mass-reported him.

27
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,920
But nonetheless, the message from Patreon was clear.

28
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,900
Their terms of service extends not only over their platform or your channel, but over reality

29
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,900
itself.

30
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,760
If you've got a Patreon and you jokingly say some slurs with your friends, you'd

31
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,060
better hope nobody's recording that shit, because it's against Patreon's terms of

32
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,060
service.

33
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,180
Patreon banning for off-platform behavior opened the floodgates for other big tech sites

34
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,060
to do the same, and nowadays it's common and even expected for YouTube, Twitter, Twitch,

35
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,420
and Facebook to ban you for whatever they like, regardless of whether or not it actually

36
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,660
breaks the terms of service you agreed to.

37
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,340
And since the Patreon purge, other crowdfunding sites have followed suit.

38
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,740
Everybody points to Kickstarter as a decent crowdfunding platform, since it famously allowed

39
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,860
the studio fowl porn game Subverse to reach full funding, despite Tim Pool's protests.

40
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,900
But porn on Kickstarter is still a roll of the dice.

41
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,380
The Japanese doujin creator Push Publications has had multiple of their hentai projects

42
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,620
canceled by Kickstarter, with Kickstarter's official reply being,

43
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,620
Our rules strictly prohibit explicit pornographic content.

44
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,660
And further, our payment processor, that's Stripe by the way, does not allow pornographic

45
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,660
projects.

46
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,740
This is clearly a lie, because other Push projects have received full funding on Kickstarter,

47
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,820
as well as many other pornographic projects.

48
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,940
It just seems to be completely arbitrary whether or not something gets banned.

49
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,380
You'd think they'd have the manpower to manually review every project and figure this

50
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,380
shit out.

51
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,260
I guess that's what you get for using unionized workers.

52
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,900
In fact, just a few months after unionizing, Kickstarter had to lay off 40% of its workforce

53
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,140
in order to make the budget work.

54
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,580
It's not just porn though.

55
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,340
Mike Miller of Lone Star Comics tried to get his graphic novel, Lone Star, funded on

56
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,340
Kickstarter.

57
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,340
Kickstarter sent him an email stating,

58
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,020
As a public benefit corporation committed to fighting inequality and creating a more

59
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,980
equitable world, Kickstarter does not allow discrimination, subjugation, or intolerance

60
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,540
towards marginalized groups.

61
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,220
The comic's objectionable content was that the hero, Lone Star, was fighting members

62
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,820
of the Central American criminal organization MS-13.

63
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,420
Now, I don't know about you, but it seems like what naturally follows from Kickstarter's

64
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,580
implication that the comic is racist, is that violent MS-13 marauders are somehow representative

65
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,300
of the average Latino individual.

66
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,020
Either Kickstarter is shockingly racist themselves, or they're actually carrying water for a

67
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,580
raping murderous cartel.

68
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,500
There's other examples of Kickstarter behaving this way, like them removing a page for funding

69
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,180
a pro-life abortion documentary, or the large number of comics that have been rejected for

70
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,820
vague, hand-waved reasons.

71
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,380
But let's not get too bogged down, Kickstarter's competitors are just as bad.

72
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,460
The owner of the Parkside Cafe in Birmingham, Alabama found himself getting canceled for

73
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,580
his anti-George Floyd views, where he notably called Floyd a thug.

74
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,980
Candace Owens decided to start up a GoFundMe for the business, but GoFundMe pulled the

75
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,980
plug on it.

76
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,500
Along with Owens' entire GoFundMe account and any other pages connected to it, for her

77
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,880
support of hate, violence, harassment, bullying, discrimination, terrorism, or intolerance

78
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,400
of any kind, a different GoFundMe page attempted to raise the necessary amount to pay for a

79
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,680
recount during the 2020 election.

80
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,800
GoFundMe claimed that the page was spreading misinformation about the election, while Matt

81
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,680
Brainerd, the Trump staffer who created it, claimed that GoFundMe was interfering in the

82
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,840
electoral process by deplatforming him.

83
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,940
Regardless of how you feel about either of these events, George Floyd, or the 2020 election,

84
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,620
it's not hard to see that these moves by GoFundMe are taken in the context of supporting a prevailing

85
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,160
cultural narrative that extends far beyond their company.

86
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,480
GoFundMe's job isn't to pass judgment on whether or not the election was fraudulent,

87
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,040
or whether or not George Floyd was murdered, but rather than remain neutral, they have

88
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,240
accepted one narrative as fact and called its opposition misinformation, even though

89
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,960
many of their users actively disagree with them.

90
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,200
Indiegogo is much the same way, though at least that brought us Lightbringer.

91
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,040
Bitchute's attempt to fund an alternative comment plugin to Discus was removed from

92
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,720
Indiegogo for no reason whatsoever.

93
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,400
Same with Althaven, a QAnon-centric superhero comic, though that does actually sound pretty

94
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
cringe.

95
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,480
For examples all day, but the point remains clear.

96
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,320
Rather than remain neutral platforms, pretty much every crowdfunding site with the exception

97
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,480
of Subscribestar, and don't forget to go to Subscribestar.com and get yourself into the

98
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,120
$5 club and my Discord, kids, have all decided to take blatantly political stances on how

99
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,680
their services are used, and what they deplatform in the name of safety or misinformation.

100
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
And you know what?

101
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,680
Just for the sake of argument, let's give them the biggest possible benefit of the doubt.

102
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,400
Let's accept the George Floyd deplatforming because Floyd did die in police custody, making

103
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,960
the police ultimately responsible.

104
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,240
Let's accept the election one because every investigation into the events surrounding

105
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,920
the election has turned up nothing.

106
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,740
Let's accept the Lauren Southern thing because she impeded a search and rescue.

107
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,900
Let's accept the QAnon comic one because, well, QAnon.

108
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,160
You might disagree with their politics, but they are still internally consistent.

109
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,320
They have decided on which narrative is the truth, and yeah, they shouldn't do that,

110
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,900
but now that we're at that point, it's reasonable to expect them to apply their terms

111
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,220
of service equally within this framework.

112
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,620
Even giving them this benefit of the doubt, though, these platforms almost always end

113
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,300
up being scumfuck pieces of shit because they don't actually apply their terms of

114
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,120
service equally within this framework.

115
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,620
Here is an excellent example.

116
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,380
GoFundMe took down a number of campaigns for Kyle Rittenhouse's defense after the Kenosha

117
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,380
Riots.

118
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,060
Yes, believe it or not, that video's still coming.

119
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,900
And after Kyle got his not guilty verdict, GoFundMe reversed that stance, stating that

120
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,300
while their terms of service doesn't allow for the raising of funds with the defense

121
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,420
of somebody charged with a violent crime, once that person is acquitted, it's fair

122
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,420
game again.

123
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,420
That seems alright to me.

124
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,580
The problem is, GoFundMe doesn't actually apply this policy evenly.

125
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,740
Instead, they apply it with a political bias.

126
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:45,140
Brandon Lee Pack, an Antifa rioter, has been convicted and sentenced to nine years in prison

127
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,660
for throwing rocks, bricks, and fireworks at police during a BLM event in May of 2020,

128
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,540
causing 21 officers to suffer burns, permanent hearing loss, one broken foot, and other injuries.

129
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,100
His charges include aggravated riot, vandalism, breaking and entering, and felonious assault.

130
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,980
His bail was raised on GoFundMe.

131
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,580
There's also the case of GoFundMe deleting a black Trump supporters fundraiser for bulletproof

132
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,860
vests while allowing an identical fundraiser for Antifa's vest to remain up.

133
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,860
No, really.

134
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,620
Look, he used the exact same language as the Antifa GoFundMe page, but only his was locked.

135
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,820
The creator was told it would be reviewed if he produced clarification surrounding the

136
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,260
use of funds, as well as receipts of purchases, which he did provide.

137
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,700
GoFundMe went silent for a week, and when the creator emailed them asking them what

138
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,340
the holdup was, he was quickly banned from the site.

139
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,220
Hell, the event that sparked the Kenosha Riots, the completely 100% fucking justified

140
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,780
shooting of Jacob Blake, where Blake was in the middle of abducting kids, getting into

141
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,580
a vehicle with a knife in hand after assaulting the mother, whom he had sexually assaulted

142
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,260
in the past, and he was shot in the back in order to stop him after tasering him had failed?

143
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,740
Yeah, fuck this guy, he's a piece of shit.

144
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,820
Well, his GoFundMe page is still up, 18 months later, with 2.3 million dollars already donated.

145
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,360
The page's description is ambiguous about Blake's own crimes, mostly focusing on his

146
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,400
kids and his medical recovery, but it is nonetheless called justice for Jacob Blake,

147
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,280
noting that part of the proceeds will go to, the deliberately vague, assisting our family

148
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,000
in the days to come, which could mean anything, including legal defenses.

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,780
I guarantee you, prior to Kyle Rittenhouse's acquittal, if any GoFundMe popped up talking

150
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,720
about funding Kyle's mental health treatment or something, while not mentioning the trial

151
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,500
expenses at all, it would still have been taken down.

152
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,840
You know it, and I know it.

153
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,360
These platforms have an obvious bias when it comes to who they fund and why.

154
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,440
They'll have some perfectly reasonable restrictions on not funding people for certain legal reasons,

155
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,260
but then completely throw these away when the politics have flipped.

156
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,040
The more normie objections regarding fundraising platforms generally revolve around two critiques.

157
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,760
One, that big game companies use them when they've clearly got the money to pay for

158
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,940
a game themselves, like with Shenmue 3 or the wonderful 101 Switch port, which came

159
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,020
out looking awful, how the hell did you manage that, it was a Wii U game.

160
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,620
And two, that people just take money and run, whether that be for scam products that never

161
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,540
see the light of day, video game projects that become vaporware, or YouTubers who continue

162
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,320
to take payouts while producing nothing at all.

163
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,340
And all of these fundraising campaigns?

164
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,340
The scam products?

165
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,340
The failed games?

166
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,540
The lazy YouTubers?

167
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,540
They never get cancelled.

168
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,540
But if you disagree with the politics of the company, your ass is grass, son.

169
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,540
Let me repeat it.

170
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,100
To these guys, writing about thieves in a comic book is worse than being a thief in

171
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,460
real fucking life.

172
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,540
As always, there are alt-tech alternatives.

173
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,820
SubscribeStar works wonders as a Patreon alternative.

174
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,740
GiveSendGo is pretty good for single large fundraisers, for projects that would normally

175
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,740
use Kickstarter, Indiegogo, or GoFundMe, though it did recently suffer a data breach, revealing

176
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,700
the names of the anonymous donors to Kyle Rittenhouse that use the platform.

177
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,540
But as always, people reroute around monopolies and tyrannical behavior all the time.

178
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,660
The philosophical problem underpinning all of this, though, is the attitudes of these

179
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,660
companies.

180
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,100
As I previously discussed during the Patreon purge, Patreon's stance is that it funds

181
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,840
the creative class, and that if you're a creator using its platform, you should be

182
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,900
lucky they don't contractually own your content or your business, though they have

183
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,580
been slowly moving in that direction over the years since.

184
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,980
For example, the Patreon merch options gives them exclusive ownership over any merch and

185
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,780
branding used on it should you decide to go with them for your merch.

186
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,580
However, the reality is, Patreon does not fund the creative class.

187
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,220
The fans of those creators do.

188
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,220
Patreon is a business that handles the money exchange between audience and creator, and

189
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,020
provides convenience in exchange for a skim off the top.

190
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,220
PayPal, at this point, has its own recurring monthly donation button too, but Patreon bundles

191
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,740
all of your donations into one convenient charge.

192
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,260
And yes, PayPal also has its own problems with the platforming.

193
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,840
The point is, though, that the people at Patreon have a completely different view of their

194
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,940
service than the people who actually use that service.

195
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,680
On some level, Patreon believes that it employs creators and that it pays them a monthly check,

196
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,680
but it doesn't.

197
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,680
It facilitates payments.

198
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
It's not an employer.

199
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,180
And the language used at Patreon is also used at Kickstarter, GoFundMe, and Indiegogo.

200
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,780
They all view themselves as something more than they are.

201
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:45,460
They all believe that facilitating money-changing hands should give them some kind of stake

202
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,940
in the creators that use them.

203
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,820
And they're all making these slow but steady steps to position themselves as the owners

204
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,780
of the projects they fund and the employer of the creators who use them.

205
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,020
That's why they think it's no big deal to just behave the way that they do.

206
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,260
After all, all of us content creators are just going to be their employees one day anyway.

207
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,980
Without any benefits of actually being employed, of course.

208
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,460
YouTube and Twitch, in their own way, also talk about creators like this too.

209
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,140
And they are, as well, slowly moving in this direction.

210
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,640
The roadblock in the way of their plans, frankly, is the massive number of creators who still

211
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,240
sit on old contracts in perpetuity with places like Twitch or Patreon, where it's still

212
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,840
enshrined that the creators own the IP, not the platforms.

213
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,800
And how ridiculous would it be if it were reversed?

214
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,080
Should my phone company own my business if I do business over the phone?

215
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
It's stupid.

216
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,760
Yes, it's shitty that people get to platform from payment processors.

217
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,840
Yes, we should be using alternatives as much as possible.

218
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,720
But I want you to bookmark this video.

219
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,960
Within a decade, and likely a lot sooner, unless something major changes, we will see

220
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,340
a very strong public push from all of these platforms.

221
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:46,340
We will see the mask come off, where they attempt to rearrange their relationship with

222
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,860
content creators such that creators lose all ownership of their operations in exchange

223
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,420
for the privilege of crowdfunding.

224
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,540
I'm calling it now.

225
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,440
This happened with multi-channel networks on YouTube 10 years ago.

226
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,780
Why do you think Yahtzee is still with The Escapist?

227
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,300
Why do you think Doug Walker still works for Mike Michaud?

228
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,100
Why do you think Machinima had the reputation that it did?

229
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,100
If you're a creator and you're not using an alternative crowdfunding source, you're basically

230
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,660
putting the nails in your own coffin.
