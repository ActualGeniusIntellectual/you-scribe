00:00.000 --> 00:07.360
The Patreon Purge Everyone remembers the Patreon Purge, right?

00:07.360 --> 00:10.480
I did a series of videos on it back in the day, go check them out.

00:10.480 --> 00:16.800
TLDR is, in 2017, Jack Conte published a video about what he called Manifest Observable Behavior

00:16.800 --> 00:20.680
as justification for why he banned Lauren Southern's Patreon account, costing her

00:20.680 --> 00:21.680
quite a bit of money.

00:21.680 --> 00:24.860
Southern was involved in a controversy in Europe, where she was in a boat attempting

00:24.860 --> 00:28.080
to block an Italian search and rescue mission in the Mediterranean Sea.

00:28.080 --> 00:32.140
He was campaigning against the flow of migrants into Europe at that time, and viewed the search

00:32.140 --> 00:36.220
and rescue operation as connected to the steady movement of refugees by water from Africa

00:36.220 --> 00:37.560
and the Middle East to Europe.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.980
I'm not here to talk about that controversy today, I don't know enough about it, frankly.

00:40.980 --> 00:45.920
But I do know that Patreon interpreted the event as likely to cause loss of life, recognized

00:45.920 --> 00:50.100
that their funding helped her perform those actions, and so they banned her from receiving

00:50.100 --> 00:52.240
any further funding on Patreon.

00:52.240 --> 00:55.200
As Jack said, Manifest Observable Behavior.

00:55.460 --> 00:59.700
According to him, it was not any sort of hateful rhetoric that got Lauren Southern banned,

00:59.700 --> 01:02.100
but rather what she did in real life.

01:02.100 --> 01:08.280
A year later, in 2018, Patreon violated this Manifest Observable Behavior rule by banning

01:08.280 --> 01:12.140
Sargon of Akkad from its platform, not for anything he did in real life, not for anything

01:12.140 --> 01:16.440
he did on his YouTube channel, not for anything he did on Patreon, but for dropping the gamer

01:16.440 --> 01:18.760
words as a guest on another person's channel.

01:18.760 --> 01:22.060
You would really have to go and search it out to even know that it happened, as the

01:22.060 --> 01:25.980
channel that it happened on was extremely small, and in fact that's what happened.

01:25.980 --> 01:29.500
Here's some deep lore that's been lost to time, and unfortunately I can't corroborate

01:29.500 --> 01:33.700
it anymore since my old Twitter DMs are gone, but I have it on first-hand knowledge that

01:33.700 --> 01:36.540
it was Ethan Ralph's community that mass-reported him.

01:36.540 --> 01:38.920
But nonetheless, the message from Patreon was clear.

01:38.920 --> 01:43.900
Their terms of service extends not only over their platform or your channel, but over reality

01:43.900 --> 01:44.900
itself.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.760
If you've got a Patreon and you jokingly say some slurs with your friends, you'd

01:47.760 --> 01:51.060
better hope nobody's recording that shit, because it's against Patreon's terms of

01:51.060 --> 01:52.060
service.

01:52.060 --> 01:56.180
Patreon banning for off-platform behavior opened the floodgates for other big tech sites

01:56.180 --> 02:01.060
to do the same, and nowadays it's common and even expected for YouTube, Twitter, Twitch,

02:01.060 --> 02:04.420
and Facebook to ban you for whatever they like, regardless of whether or not it actually

02:04.420 --> 02:06.660
breaks the terms of service you agreed to.

02:06.660 --> 02:10.340
And since the Patreon purge, other crowdfunding sites have followed suit.

02:10.340 --> 02:14.740
Everybody points to Kickstarter as a decent crowdfunding platform, since it famously allowed

02:14.740 --> 02:19.860
the studio fowl porn game Subverse to reach full funding, despite Tim Pool's protests.

02:19.860 --> 02:21.900
But porn on Kickstarter is still a roll of the dice.

02:21.900 --> 02:26.380
The Japanese doujin creator Push Publications has had multiple of their hentai projects

02:26.380 --> 02:29.620
canceled by Kickstarter, with Kickstarter's official reply being,

02:29.620 --> 02:32.620
Our rules strictly prohibit explicit pornographic content.

02:32.620 --> 02:36.660
And further, our payment processor, that's Stripe by the way, does not allow pornographic

02:36.660 --> 02:37.660
projects.

02:37.660 --> 02:42.740
This is clearly a lie, because other Push projects have received full funding on Kickstarter,

02:42.740 --> 02:44.820
as well as many other pornographic projects.

02:44.820 --> 02:47.940
It just seems to be completely arbitrary whether or not something gets banned.

02:48.020 --> 02:51.380
You'd think they'd have the manpower to manually review every project and figure this

02:51.380 --> 02:52.380
shit out.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.260
I guess that's what you get for using unionized workers.

02:54.260 --> 02:58.900
In fact, just a few months after unionizing, Kickstarter had to lay off 40% of its workforce

02:58.900 --> 03:00.140
in order to make the budget work.

03:00.140 --> 03:01.580
It's not just porn though.

03:01.580 --> 03:06.340
Mike Miller of Lone Star Comics tried to get his graphic novel, Lone Star, funded on

03:06.340 --> 03:07.340
Kickstarter.

03:07.340 --> 03:08.340
Kickstarter sent him an email stating,

03:08.340 --> 03:12.020
As a public benefit corporation committed to fighting inequality and creating a more

03:12.020 --> 03:15.980
equitable world, Kickstarter does not allow discrimination, subjugation, or intolerance

03:15.980 --> 03:17.540
towards marginalized groups.

03:17.540 --> 03:22.220
The comic's objectionable content was that the hero, Lone Star, was fighting members

03:22.220 --> 03:24.820
of the Central American criminal organization MS-13.

03:24.820 --> 03:29.420
Now, I don't know about you, but it seems like what naturally follows from Kickstarter's

03:29.420 --> 03:34.580
implication that the comic is racist, is that violent MS-13 marauders are somehow representative

03:34.580 --> 03:36.300
of the average Latino individual.

03:36.300 --> 03:41.020
Either Kickstarter is shockingly racist themselves, or they're actually carrying water for a

03:41.020 --> 03:42.580
raping murderous cartel.

03:42.580 --> 03:46.500
There's other examples of Kickstarter behaving this way, like them removing a page for funding

03:46.500 --> 03:50.180
a pro-life abortion documentary, or the large number of comics that have been rejected for

03:50.180 --> 03:51.820
vague, hand-waved reasons.

03:51.820 --> 03:55.380
But let's not get too bogged down, Kickstarter's competitors are just as bad.

03:55.380 --> 03:59.460
The owner of the Parkside Cafe in Birmingham, Alabama found himself getting canceled for

03:59.460 --> 04:03.580
his anti-George Floyd views, where he notably called Floyd a thug.

04:03.580 --> 04:06.980
Candace Owens decided to start up a GoFundMe for the business, but GoFundMe pulled the

04:06.980 --> 04:07.980
plug on it.

04:07.980 --> 04:11.500
Along with Owens' entire GoFundMe account and any other pages connected to it, for her

04:11.500 --> 04:15.880
support of hate, violence, harassment, bullying, discrimination, terrorism, or intolerance

04:15.880 --> 04:20.400
of any kind, a different GoFundMe page attempted to raise the necessary amount to pay for a

04:20.400 --> 04:22.680
recount during the 2020 election.

04:22.680 --> 04:25.800
GoFundMe claimed that the page was spreading misinformation about the election, while Matt

04:25.800 --> 04:29.680
Brainerd, the Trump staffer who created it, claimed that GoFundMe was interfering in the

04:29.680 --> 04:31.840
electoral process by deplatforming him.

04:31.840 --> 04:35.940
Regardless of how you feel about either of these events, George Floyd, or the 2020 election,

04:35.940 --> 04:40.620
it's not hard to see that these moves by GoFundMe are taken in the context of supporting a prevailing

04:40.620 --> 04:44.160
cultural narrative that extends far beyond their company.

04:44.160 --> 04:47.480
GoFundMe's job isn't to pass judgment on whether or not the election was fraudulent,

04:47.480 --> 04:51.040
or whether or not George Floyd was murdered, but rather than remain neutral, they have

04:51.040 --> 04:55.240
accepted one narrative as fact and called its opposition misinformation, even though

04:55.240 --> 04:57.960
many of their users actively disagree with them.

04:57.960 --> 05:01.200
Indiegogo is much the same way, though at least that brought us Lightbringer.

05:01.200 --> 05:05.040
Bitchute's attempt to fund an alternative comment plugin to Discus was removed from

05:05.040 --> 05:06.720
Indiegogo for no reason whatsoever.

05:06.720 --> 05:11.400
Same with Althaven, a QAnon-centric superhero comic, though that does actually sound pretty

05:11.400 --> 05:12.400
cringe.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.480
For examples all day, but the point remains clear.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.320
Rather than remain neutral platforms, pretty much every crowdfunding site with the exception

05:18.320 --> 05:22.480
of Subscribestar, and don't forget to go to Subscribestar.com and get yourself into the

05:22.480 --> 05:27.120
$5 club and my Discord, kids, have all decided to take blatantly political stances on how

05:27.120 --> 05:31.680
their services are used, and what they deplatform in the name of safety or misinformation.

05:31.680 --> 05:32.680
And you know what?

05:32.680 --> 05:35.680
Just for the sake of argument, let's give them the biggest possible benefit of the doubt.

05:35.680 --> 05:39.400
Let's accept the George Floyd deplatforming because Floyd did die in police custody, making

05:39.400 --> 05:40.960
the police ultimately responsible.

05:40.960 --> 05:44.240
Let's accept the election one because every investigation into the events surrounding

05:44.240 --> 05:45.920
the election has turned up nothing.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.740
Let's accept the Lauren Southern thing because she impeded a search and rescue.

05:48.740 --> 05:51.900
Let's accept the QAnon comic one because, well, QAnon.

05:51.900 --> 05:55.160
You might disagree with their politics, but they are still internally consistent.

05:55.160 --> 05:58.320
They have decided on which narrative is the truth, and yeah, they shouldn't do that,

05:58.320 --> 06:01.900
but now that we're at that point, it's reasonable to expect them to apply their terms

06:01.900 --> 06:04.220
of service equally within this framework.

06:04.220 --> 06:07.620
Even giving them this benefit of the doubt, though, these platforms almost always end

06:07.620 --> 06:11.300
up being scumfuck pieces of shit because they don't actually apply their terms of

06:11.300 --> 06:13.120
service equally within this framework.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.620
Here is an excellent example.

06:14.620 --> 06:18.380
GoFundMe took down a number of campaigns for Kyle Rittenhouse's defense after the Kenosha

06:18.380 --> 06:19.380
Riots.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.060
Yes, believe it or not, that video's still coming.

06:21.060 --> 06:25.900
And after Kyle got his not guilty verdict, GoFundMe reversed that stance, stating that

06:25.900 --> 06:29.300
while their terms of service doesn't allow for the raising of funds with the defense

06:29.300 --> 06:32.420
of somebody charged with a violent crime, once that person is acquitted, it's fair

06:32.420 --> 06:33.420
game again.

06:33.420 --> 06:34.420
That seems alright to me.

06:34.420 --> 06:37.580
The problem is, GoFundMe doesn't actually apply this policy evenly.

06:37.580 --> 06:39.740
Instead, they apply it with a political bias.

06:39.740 --> 06:45.140
Brandon Lee Pack, an Antifa rioter, has been convicted and sentenced to nine years in prison

06:45.140 --> 06:50.660
for throwing rocks, bricks, and fireworks at police during a BLM event in May of 2020,

06:50.660 --> 06:55.540
causing 21 officers to suffer burns, permanent hearing loss, one broken foot, and other injuries.

06:55.540 --> 07:00.100
His charges include aggravated riot, vandalism, breaking and entering, and felonious assault.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.980
His bail was raised on GoFundMe.

07:01.980 --> 07:06.580
There's also the case of GoFundMe deleting a black Trump supporters fundraiser for bulletproof

07:06.580 --> 07:09.860
vests while allowing an identical fundraiser for Antifa's vest to remain up.

07:09.860 --> 07:10.860
No, really.

07:10.860 --> 07:15.620
Look, he used the exact same language as the Antifa GoFundMe page, but only his was locked.

07:15.620 --> 07:18.820
The creator was told it would be reviewed if he produced clarification surrounding the

07:18.820 --> 07:22.260
use of funds, as well as receipts of purchases, which he did provide.

07:22.260 --> 07:25.700
GoFundMe went silent for a week, and when the creator emailed them asking them what

07:25.700 --> 07:28.340
the holdup was, he was quickly banned from the site.

07:28.340 --> 07:33.220
Hell, the event that sparked the Kenosha Riots, the completely 100% fucking justified

07:33.220 --> 07:36.780
shooting of Jacob Blake, where Blake was in the middle of abducting kids, getting into

07:36.780 --> 07:40.580
a vehicle with a knife in hand after assaulting the mother, whom he had sexually assaulted

07:40.580 --> 07:44.260
in the past, and he was shot in the back in order to stop him after tasering him had failed?

07:44.260 --> 07:45.740
Yeah, fuck this guy, he's a piece of shit.

07:45.740 --> 07:50.820
Well, his GoFundMe page is still up, 18 months later, with 2.3 million dollars already donated.

07:50.820 --> 07:55.360
The page's description is ambiguous about Blake's own crimes, mostly focusing on his

07:55.360 --> 08:00.400
kids and his medical recovery, but it is nonetheless called justice for Jacob Blake,

08:00.400 --> 08:05.280
noting that part of the proceeds will go to, the deliberately vague, assisting our family

08:05.280 --> 08:09.000
in the days to come, which could mean anything, including legal defenses.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.780
I guarantee you, prior to Kyle Rittenhouse's acquittal, if any GoFundMe popped up talking

08:13.780 --> 08:17.720
about funding Kyle's mental health treatment or something, while not mentioning the trial

08:17.720 --> 08:20.500
expenses at all, it would still have been taken down.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.840
You know it, and I know it.

08:21.840 --> 08:25.360
These platforms have an obvious bias when it comes to who they fund and why.

08:25.360 --> 08:29.440
They'll have some perfectly reasonable restrictions on not funding people for certain legal reasons,

08:29.440 --> 08:32.260
but then completely throw these away when the politics have flipped.

08:32.260 --> 08:36.040
The more normie objections regarding fundraising platforms generally revolve around two critiques.

08:36.040 --> 08:39.760
One, that big game companies use them when they've clearly got the money to pay for

08:39.760 --> 08:43.940
a game themselves, like with Shenmue 3 or the wonderful 101 Switch port, which came

08:43.940 --> 08:47.020
out looking awful, how the hell did you manage that, it was a Wii U game.

08:47.020 --> 08:50.620
And two, that people just take money and run, whether that be for scam products that never

08:50.620 --> 08:54.540
see the light of day, video game projects that become vaporware, or YouTubers who continue

08:54.540 --> 08:56.320
to take payouts while producing nothing at all.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.340
And all of these fundraising campaigns?

08:58.340 --> 08:59.340
The scam products?

08:59.340 --> 09:00.340
The failed games?

09:00.340 --> 09:01.540
The lazy YouTubers?

09:01.540 --> 09:02.540
They never get cancelled.

09:02.540 --> 09:05.540
But if you disagree with the politics of the company, your ass is grass, son.

09:05.540 --> 09:06.540
Let me repeat it.

09:06.540 --> 09:10.100
To these guys, writing about thieves in a comic book is worse than being a thief in

09:10.100 --> 09:11.460
real fucking life.

09:11.460 --> 09:13.540
As always, there are alt-tech alternatives.

09:13.540 --> 09:15.820
SubscribeStar works wonders as a Patreon alternative.

09:15.820 --> 09:19.740
GiveSendGo is pretty good for single large fundraisers, for projects that would normally

09:19.740 --> 09:24.740
use Kickstarter, Indiegogo, or GoFundMe, though it did recently suffer a data breach, revealing

09:24.740 --> 09:27.700
the names of the anonymous donors to Kyle Rittenhouse that use the platform.

09:27.700 --> 09:31.540
But as always, people reroute around monopolies and tyrannical behavior all the time.

09:31.540 --> 09:35.660
The philosophical problem underpinning all of this, though, is the attitudes of these

09:35.660 --> 09:36.660
companies.

09:36.660 --> 09:40.100
As I previously discussed during the Patreon purge, Patreon's stance is that it funds

09:40.100 --> 09:43.840
the creative class, and that if you're a creator using its platform, you should be

09:43.840 --> 09:47.900
lucky they don't contractually own your content or your business, though they have

09:47.900 --> 09:50.580
been slowly moving in that direction over the years since.

09:50.580 --> 09:54.980
For example, the Patreon merch options gives them exclusive ownership over any merch and

09:54.980 --> 09:57.780
branding used on it should you decide to go with them for your merch.

09:57.780 --> 10:01.580
However, the reality is, Patreon does not fund the creative class.

10:01.580 --> 10:03.220
The fans of those creators do.

10:03.220 --> 10:07.220
Patreon is a business that handles the money exchange between audience and creator, and

10:07.220 --> 10:10.020
provides convenience in exchange for a skim off the top.

10:10.020 --> 10:14.220
PayPal, at this point, has its own recurring monthly donation button too, but Patreon bundles

10:14.220 --> 10:16.740
all of your donations into one convenient charge.

10:16.740 --> 10:19.260
And yes, PayPal also has its own problems with the platforming.

10:19.260 --> 10:22.840
The point is, though, that the people at Patreon have a completely different view of their

10:22.840 --> 10:25.940
service than the people who actually use that service.

10:25.940 --> 10:30.680
On some level, Patreon believes that it employs creators and that it pays them a monthly check,

10:30.680 --> 10:31.680
but it doesn't.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.680
It facilitates payments.

10:32.680 --> 10:33.680
It's not an employer.

10:33.680 --> 10:38.180
And the language used at Patreon is also used at Kickstarter, GoFundMe, and Indiegogo.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.780
They all view themselves as something more than they are.

10:40.780 --> 10:45.460
They all believe that facilitating money-changing hands should give them some kind of stake

10:45.460 --> 10:46.940
in the creators that use them.

10:46.940 --> 10:50.820
And they're all making these slow but steady steps to position themselves as the owners

10:50.820 --> 10:53.780
of the projects they fund and the employer of the creators who use them.

10:53.780 --> 10:57.020
That's why they think it's no big deal to just behave the way that they do.

10:57.020 --> 11:00.260
After all, all of us content creators are just going to be their employees one day anyway.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.980
Without any benefits of actually being employed, of course.

11:02.980 --> 11:06.460
YouTube and Twitch, in their own way, also talk about creators like this too.

11:06.460 --> 11:09.140
And they are, as well, slowly moving in this direction.

11:09.140 --> 11:13.640
The roadblock in the way of their plans, frankly, is the massive number of creators who still

11:13.640 --> 11:18.240
sit on old contracts in perpetuity with places like Twitch or Patreon, where it's still

11:18.240 --> 11:21.840
enshrined that the creators own the IP, not the platforms.

11:21.840 --> 11:23.800
And how ridiculous would it be if it were reversed?

11:23.800 --> 11:27.080
Should my phone company own my business if I do business over the phone?

11:27.080 --> 11:28.080
It's stupid.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.760
Yes, it's shitty that people get to platform from payment processors.

11:30.760 --> 11:33.840
Yes, we should be using alternatives as much as possible.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.720
But I want you to bookmark this video.

11:35.720 --> 11:38.960
Within a decade, and likely a lot sooner, unless something major changes, we will see

11:38.960 --> 11:42.340
a very strong public push from all of these platforms.

11:42.340 --> 11:46.340
We will see the mask come off, where they attempt to rearrange their relationship with

11:46.340 --> 11:50.860
content creators such that creators lose all ownership of their operations in exchange

11:50.860 --> 11:52.420
for the privilege of crowdfunding.

11:52.420 --> 11:53.540
I'm calling it now.

11:53.540 --> 11:56.440
This happened with multi-channel networks on YouTube 10 years ago.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.780
Why do you think Yahtzee is still with The Escapist?

11:58.780 --> 12:01.300
Why do you think Doug Walker still works for Mike Michaud?

12:01.300 --> 12:04.100
Why do you think Machinima had the reputation that it did?

12:04.100 --> 12:08.100
If you're a creator and you're not using an alternative crowdfunding source, you're basically

12:08.100 --> 12:09.660
putting the nails in your own coffin.
