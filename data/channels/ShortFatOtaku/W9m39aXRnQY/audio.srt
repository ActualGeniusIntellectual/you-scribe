00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Hey guys, I'm making a quick short addendum to the How YouTube Sucks Better Help video.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,520
At the end of the video, I said this, let's just listen to it again just so we're all

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,520
on the same page.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,480
I know I'm a bit late on this one guys, thanks for listening anyway.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,280
I can promise you right now, I'm never gonna sell you guys out.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,780
I mean my description contains a Humble Bundle affiliate link, but that's a service that

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,680
I use and I actually think it's good.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,520
And you won't see a paid ad on this channel for anything unless I've used it myself already.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,160
Alright, that about does it for me.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,520
I'll see you guys later.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,600
I love you.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,740
So I still for the most part stand by all of that, with the exception of the Humble

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,800
Bundle stuff because a bunch of people in the comments decided to drag me.

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,200
Let me just scroll through here.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,720
Humble Bundle shill.

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,280
You got me.

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,680
Honest question, how do you endorse Humble Bundle with the way they funnel money to leftist

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,480
organizations such as the ACLU?

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,520
I actually didn't know about this when I made this video guys, this is news to me.

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,800
My bet is he did not know, I did not know.

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Sargon knew.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,520
Fun fact, Humble Bundle are owned by IGN and donating money to the LCAU.

23
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,440
Ah shit, see I didn't know.

24
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,040
Pour one out for Humble Bundle.

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,520
Humble Bundle is a terrible service, it floods your Steam library with hundreds of games,

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,720
what shall I do with it?

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,320
You mentioned you support Humble Bundle even though you support the ACLU.

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,840
Hasn't Humble Bundle been outed in some bullshit funneling money to the ACLU?

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,860
The quartering did a video on it.

30
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:30,340
See I didn't know, the quartering is a, not like a close friend, but a friend of mine

31
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,060
and I don't watch every single one of his videos unfortunately.

32
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,060
Doesn't Humble Bundle pay the ACLU?

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,060
Etc.

34
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,060
Etc.

35
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,060
Guys I didn't know.

36
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,140
I legitimately didn't know.

37
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,260
And I did watch the quarterings video before making this one so I have a rough idea of

38
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,260
what's going on.

39
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:54,500
Apparently IGN bought Humble Bundle and Humble Bundle has now been doing these various bundles

40
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:00,160
that support really shitty groups like the ACLU because the ACLU is a pretty shitty group

41
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,500
if you look into them.

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,220
And if you want to look into them go watch the quarterings video, it's a good video.

43
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:12,220
However the quartering states in that video that he's not a user of Humble Bundle and

44
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,340
he missed a few points that I want to bring up.

45
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,660
This is not necessarily a reply video to him though it kind of is.

46
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,760
This is not necessarily me defending Humble Bundle because very clearly it's indefensible

47
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,340
to support the ACLU like this and not tell people about it.

48
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:34,520
But I am going to maybe offer a reasonable justification as to why I won't be removing

49
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,120
my Humble Bundle affiliate link.

50
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,200
Even though frankly I don't think anyone's used it yet.

51
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,960
But let me just show you, I'll go through the process with you so that you can see what

52
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,620
exactly I'm talking about.

53
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,540
So I'm open on an incognito window so that I'm not logged into anything.

54
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,820
This is just an incognito window in Google Chrome.

55
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,500
Here's my Humble Bundle affiliate link.

56
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,960
It's right here, see?

57
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,620
Let's open that up in a new tab.

58
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:12,320
Because you've clicked on my partner link, you can actually do all of these various bundles

59
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
that they have going.

60
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,580
So let's do the gaming one.

61
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,820
It's the WB Games Classics Bundle.

62
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,980
Let's open that one up in a new link.

63
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,340
As you see, seven days remaining, you get Scribblenauts, Shadow of Mordor, Batman Arkham

64
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,540
Oranges, et cetera.

65
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,700
You pay more than the average of $4.13.

66
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,340
You also get these games.

67
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,520
You pay $12 or more and you get these games.

68
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,660
And this is all the stuff.

69
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:44,540
You get these various things partnered with Short Fight Otaku.

70
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:50,540
So something that people kind of know, but not necessarily, is that at the bottom here,

71
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,500
there's a tab that says choose where your money goes and you click this.

72
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,380
And if you didn't go through an affiliate link at all, let's just say that you were

73
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:06,320
just using Humble Bundle without any affiliate link active, you would see WB Games, Charity,

74
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
and Humble Tip.

75
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,220
And you can adjust these sliders to see how much of your money goes to certain places.

76
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,860
The charity this one has selected is Choose Charities, Be The Match, and Crisis Text Line.

77
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,900
And I think you can actually change these charities.

78
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,820
Is there a button to change it up here?

79
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,820
I think there was.

80
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,820
Let's see.

81
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,820
Yeah, yeah.

82
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,600
If you want to change charities, here's more charities.

83
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,100
You can select a new charity.

84
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,500
So you can, in fact, choose various charities if you want to donate money.

85
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,620
Now let's say you want a custom amount.

86
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,820
Let's say you're going to spend $25 in this bundle.

87
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,820
Okay.

88
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,820
It's already $25.

89
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,820
$25 is already in there.

90
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,900
$35, just so I can show you how this works.

91
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,220
So you decide to spend $35 in this bundle.

92
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,580
And look, it automatically calculates using these sliders, the percentage of which goes

93
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,580
to whoever.

94
00:04:51,580 --> 00:05:01,320
So WB Games gets $21, the charities each get $1.75, Humble Bundle gets $525, and I would

95
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,900
get $525.

96
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,640
You could also, for example, make this charity get nothing, and then that one, it automatically

97
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,860
evens it out.

98
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,620
You could, in fact, just do this, and they're linked together because it's a proportional

99
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,980
thing.

100
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:21,900
You can also make the charity get nothing, and then the other three will adjust, right?

101
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,040
The other three will, and you can make WB Games get nothing.

102
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,920
So they're linked together in a proportional way.

103
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:34,620
So for example, if you really don't like Humble Bundle because of their ACLU bullshit, you

104
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,560
can just do this.

105
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,240
You can just give me all the money, right?

106
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,500
In this instance, you'll be buying these games, these Humble Bundle games, and I will get

107
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,820
every cent.

108
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,820
And because Humble Bundle is honestly so shitty, I would recommend that you do that.

109
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,480
If you are going to use my Humble Bundle affiliate link, and you want to support my channel in

110
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,240
doing so, just give me all the money.

111
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:08,800
It sounds a bit self-serving, and on some level it is, but it is a reasonable way to

112
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,220
fuck this company over.

113
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,260
I'm probably going to lose my affiliate link for saying this, but it's a good way to fuck

114
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:21,860
this company over for their shitty business practices and still support me.

115
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:28,240
If this wasn't allowed, if this option here to choose where your money goes didn't exist,

116
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,400
I would take down my link.

117
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,500
I would disable it, and I would no longer support Humble Bundle because they do seem

118
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,180
to be acting quite shitty.

119
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,740
Let's go back to the Humble Monthly, for example, and I'll show you what I mean.

120
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,060
This Get the Vote Out Bundle is what everyone is up in arms about right now, and here's

121
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,060
why.

122
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:53,380
These are all kind of SJW-style books, they're political books, you pay money to get all

123
00:06:53,380 --> 00:07:00,020
these books, and as they say at the bottom, this is resist, as they say at the bottom,

124
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,260
it supports the charity of the ACLU.

125
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,680
There is no link to change the charity on this page.

126
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:13,820
If you keep going, you can still set your custom amount, but instead of a place to adjust

127
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:19,720
the ratios with those sliders, it just says, all for one, and one for all.

128
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,040
So if you're purchasing this bundle, everything goes to the ACLU, and you have no choice in

129
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
the matter.

130
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,840
I think that's a shitty business practice.

131
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:37,060
I have no intention of morally supporting Humble Bundle at all, ever.

132
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,060
You know what?

133
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,720
I don't know if it's possible for me to use my own affiliate link and then just give me

134
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,400
the money that I spend.

135
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
That'd be hilarious.

136
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,060
I don't mind doing that until it gets banned.

137
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:55,040
If it does get banned, I will use a friend's affiliate link, if I know a YouTuber has an

138
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,360
affiliate link, and I will just give them all the money using the sliders, I have no

139
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,760
intention of giving Humble Bundle a cent now that I've learned this.

140
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,180
However, because the bundles are a good deal, and because they give you this option to basically

141
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,040
exploit them, I'm going to exploit them until I'm banned.

142
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,360
And if you want an easy way to buy some games and support my show and support me and support

143
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,040
what I do here, I would suggest you exploit them as well until I'm banned.

144
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:29,360
But no, aside from basically fucking Humble Bundle in whatever small way that I can, I

145
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,240
no longer support this company.

146
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,360
Thank you guys for cluing me into the Quartering's video, thank you to the Quartering for making

147
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,480
that video, even though I think he missed this slider stuff here.

148
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,980
And I am sorry, I didn't know.

149
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,800
But now that I do know, hopefully everyone does this.

150
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,120
Okay, I'm out of here.

151
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,680
I love you guys.
