00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
Hey guys, I'm making a quick short addendum to the How YouTube Sucks Better Help video.

00:07.600 --> 00:11.520
At the end of the video, I said this, let's just listen to it again just so we're all

00:11.520 --> 00:12.520
on the same page.

00:12.520 --> 00:15.480
I know I'm a bit late on this one guys, thanks for listening anyway.

00:15.480 --> 00:18.280
I can promise you right now, I'm never gonna sell you guys out.

00:18.280 --> 00:21.780
I mean my description contains a Humble Bundle affiliate link, but that's a service that

00:21.780 --> 00:23.680
I use and I actually think it's good.

00:23.680 --> 00:27.520
And you won't see a paid ad on this channel for anything unless I've used it myself already.

00:27.520 --> 00:29.160
Alright, that about does it for me.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.520
I'll see you guys later.

00:30.520 --> 00:33.600
I love you.

00:33.600 --> 00:38.740
So I still for the most part stand by all of that, with the exception of the Humble

00:38.740 --> 00:43.800
Bundle stuff because a bunch of people in the comments decided to drag me.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.200
Let me just scroll through here.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.720
Humble Bundle shill.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.280
You got me.

00:49.280 --> 00:52.680
Honest question, how do you endorse Humble Bundle with the way they funnel money to leftist

00:52.680 --> 00:54.480
organizations such as the ACLU?

00:54.480 --> 00:58.520
I actually didn't know about this when I made this video guys, this is news to me.

00:58.520 --> 01:00.800
My bet is he did not know, I did not know.

01:00.800 --> 01:01.800
Sargon knew.

01:01.800 --> 01:05.520
Fun fact, Humble Bundle are owned by IGN and donating money to the LCAU.

01:05.520 --> 01:08.440
Ah shit, see I didn't know.

01:08.440 --> 01:10.040
Pour one out for Humble Bundle.

01:10.040 --> 01:13.520
Humble Bundle is a terrible service, it floods your Steam library with hundreds of games,

01:13.520 --> 01:15.720
what shall I do with it?

01:15.720 --> 01:19.320
You mentioned you support Humble Bundle even though you support the ACLU.

01:19.320 --> 01:22.840
Hasn't Humble Bundle been outed in some bullshit funneling money to the ACLU?

01:22.840 --> 01:24.860
The quartering did a video on it.

01:24.860 --> 01:30.340
See I didn't know, the quartering is a, not like a close friend, but a friend of mine

01:30.340 --> 01:34.060
and I don't watch every single one of his videos unfortunately.

01:34.060 --> 01:36.060
Doesn't Humble Bundle pay the ACLU?

01:36.060 --> 01:37.060
Etc.

01:37.060 --> 01:38.060
Etc.

01:38.060 --> 01:39.060
Guys I didn't know.

01:39.060 --> 01:41.140
I legitimately didn't know.

01:41.140 --> 01:45.260
And I did watch the quarterings video before making this one so I have a rough idea of

01:45.260 --> 01:46.260
what's going on.

01:46.260 --> 01:54.500
Apparently IGN bought Humble Bundle and Humble Bundle has now been doing these various bundles

01:54.500 --> 02:00.160
that support really shitty groups like the ACLU because the ACLU is a pretty shitty group

02:00.160 --> 02:01.500
if you look into them.

02:01.500 --> 02:06.220
And if you want to look into them go watch the quarterings video, it's a good video.

02:06.220 --> 02:12.220
However the quartering states in that video that he's not a user of Humble Bundle and

02:12.220 --> 02:15.340
he missed a few points that I want to bring up.

02:15.340 --> 02:18.660
This is not necessarily a reply video to him though it kind of is.

02:18.660 --> 02:23.760
This is not necessarily me defending Humble Bundle because very clearly it's indefensible

02:23.760 --> 02:28.340
to support the ACLU like this and not tell people about it.

02:28.340 --> 02:34.520
But I am going to maybe offer a reasonable justification as to why I won't be removing

02:34.520 --> 02:37.120
my Humble Bundle affiliate link.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.200
Even though frankly I don't think anyone's used it yet.

02:40.200 --> 02:44.960
But let me just show you, I'll go through the process with you so that you can see what

02:44.960 --> 02:46.620
exactly I'm talking about.

02:46.620 --> 02:51.540
So I'm open on an incognito window so that I'm not logged into anything.

02:51.540 --> 02:55.820
This is just an incognito window in Google Chrome.

02:55.820 --> 02:58.500
Here's my Humble Bundle affiliate link.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.960
It's right here, see?

03:00.960 --> 03:04.620
Let's open that up in a new tab.

03:04.620 --> 03:12.320
Because you've clicked on my partner link, you can actually do all of these various bundles

03:12.320 --> 03:13.320
that they have going.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.580
So let's do the gaming one.

03:14.580 --> 03:19.820
It's the WB Games Classics Bundle.

03:19.820 --> 03:22.980
Let's open that one up in a new link.

03:22.980 --> 03:28.340
As you see, seven days remaining, you get Scribblenauts, Shadow of Mordor, Batman Arkham

03:28.340 --> 03:29.540
Oranges, et cetera.

03:29.540 --> 03:31.700
You pay more than the average of $4.13.

03:31.700 --> 03:33.340
You also get these games.

03:33.340 --> 03:36.520
You pay $12 or more and you get these games.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.660
And this is all the stuff.

03:38.660 --> 03:44.540
You get these various things partnered with Short Fight Otaku.

03:44.540 --> 03:50.540
So something that people kind of know, but not necessarily, is that at the bottom here,

03:50.540 --> 03:55.500
there's a tab that says choose where your money goes and you click this.

03:55.500 --> 03:59.380
And if you didn't go through an affiliate link at all, let's just say that you were

03:59.380 --> 04:06.320
just using Humble Bundle without any affiliate link active, you would see WB Games, Charity,

04:06.320 --> 04:07.320
and Humble Tip.

04:07.320 --> 04:11.220
And you can adjust these sliders to see how much of your money goes to certain places.

04:11.220 --> 04:16.860
The charity this one has selected is Choose Charities, Be The Match, and Crisis Text Line.

04:16.860 --> 04:18.900
And I think you can actually change these charities.

04:18.900 --> 04:20.820
Is there a button to change it up here?

04:20.820 --> 04:21.820
I think there was.

04:21.820 --> 04:22.820
Let's see.

04:22.820 --> 04:23.820
Yeah, yeah.

04:23.820 --> 04:25.600
If you want to change charities, here's more charities.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.100
You can select a new charity.

04:27.100 --> 04:31.500
So you can, in fact, choose various charities if you want to donate money.

04:31.500 --> 04:34.620
Now let's say you want a custom amount.

04:34.620 --> 04:36.820
Let's say you're going to spend $25 in this bundle.

04:36.820 --> 04:37.820
Okay.

04:37.820 --> 04:38.820
It's already $25.

04:38.820 --> 04:39.820
$25 is already in there.

04:39.820 --> 04:41.900
$35, just so I can show you how this works.

04:41.900 --> 04:45.220
So you decide to spend $35 in this bundle.

04:45.220 --> 04:50.580
And look, it automatically calculates using these sliders, the percentage of which goes

04:50.580 --> 04:51.580
to whoever.

04:51.580 --> 05:01.320
So WB Games gets $21, the charities each get $1.75, Humble Bundle gets $525, and I would

05:01.320 --> 05:02.900
get $525.

05:02.900 --> 05:07.640
You could also, for example, make this charity get nothing, and then that one, it automatically

05:07.640 --> 05:08.860
evens it out.

05:08.900 --> 05:12.620
You could, in fact, just do this, and they're linked together because it's a proportional

05:12.620 --> 05:13.980
thing.

05:13.980 --> 05:21.900
You can also make the charity get nothing, and then the other three will adjust, right?

05:21.900 --> 05:25.040
The other three will, and you can make WB Games get nothing.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.920
So they're linked together in a proportional way.

05:28.920 --> 05:34.620
So for example, if you really don't like Humble Bundle because of their ACLU bullshit, you

05:34.620 --> 05:36.560
can just do this.

05:36.560 --> 05:40.240
You can just give me all the money, right?

05:40.240 --> 05:46.500
In this instance, you'll be buying these games, these Humble Bundle games, and I will get

05:46.500 --> 05:48.820
every cent.

05:48.820 --> 05:53.820
And because Humble Bundle is honestly so shitty, I would recommend that you do that.

05:53.820 --> 05:58.480
If you are going to use my Humble Bundle affiliate link, and you want to support my channel in

05:58.480 --> 06:01.240
doing so, just give me all the money.

06:01.240 --> 06:08.800
It sounds a bit self-serving, and on some level it is, but it is a reasonable way to

06:08.800 --> 06:11.220
fuck this company over.

06:11.220 --> 06:15.260
I'm probably going to lose my affiliate link for saying this, but it's a good way to fuck

06:15.260 --> 06:21.860
this company over for their shitty business practices and still support me.

06:21.860 --> 06:28.240
If this wasn't allowed, if this option here to choose where your money goes didn't exist,

06:28.240 --> 06:30.400
I would take down my link.

06:30.400 --> 06:34.500
I would disable it, and I would no longer support Humble Bundle because they do seem

06:34.500 --> 06:36.180
to be acting quite shitty.

06:36.180 --> 06:40.740
Let's go back to the Humble Monthly, for example, and I'll show you what I mean.

06:40.740 --> 06:46.060
This Get the Vote Out Bundle is what everyone is up in arms about right now, and here's

06:46.060 --> 06:47.060
why.

06:47.060 --> 06:53.380
These are all kind of SJW-style books, they're political books, you pay money to get all

06:53.380 --> 07:00.020
these books, and as they say at the bottom, this is resist, as they say at the bottom,

07:00.020 --> 07:03.260
it supports the charity of the ACLU.

07:03.260 --> 07:06.680
There is no link to change the charity on this page.

07:06.680 --> 07:13.820
If you keep going, you can still set your custom amount, but instead of a place to adjust

07:13.820 --> 07:19.720
the ratios with those sliders, it just says, all for one, and one for all.

07:19.720 --> 07:25.040
So if you're purchasing this bundle, everything goes to the ACLU, and you have no choice in

07:25.040 --> 07:26.040
the matter.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.840
I think that's a shitty business practice.

07:28.840 --> 07:37.060
I have no intention of morally supporting Humble Bundle at all, ever.

07:37.060 --> 07:38.060
You know what?

07:38.060 --> 07:43.720
I don't know if it's possible for me to use my own affiliate link and then just give me

07:43.720 --> 07:45.400
the money that I spend.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.400
That'd be hilarious.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.060
I don't mind doing that until it gets banned.

07:49.060 --> 07:55.040
If it does get banned, I will use a friend's affiliate link, if I know a YouTuber has an

07:55.040 --> 07:59.360
affiliate link, and I will just give them all the money using the sliders, I have no

07:59.360 --> 08:03.760
intention of giving Humble Bundle a cent now that I've learned this.

08:03.760 --> 08:08.180
However, because the bundles are a good deal, and because they give you this option to basically

08:08.180 --> 08:12.040
exploit them, I'm going to exploit them until I'm banned.

08:12.040 --> 08:17.360
And if you want an easy way to buy some games and support my show and support me and support

08:17.360 --> 08:22.040
what I do here, I would suggest you exploit them as well until I'm banned.

08:22.040 --> 08:29.360
But no, aside from basically fucking Humble Bundle in whatever small way that I can, I

08:29.360 --> 08:31.240
no longer support this company.

08:31.240 --> 08:35.360
Thank you guys for cluing me into the Quartering's video, thank you to the Quartering for making

08:35.360 --> 08:42.480
that video, even though I think he missed this slider stuff here.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.980
And I am sorry, I didn't know.

08:45.980 --> 08:48.800
But now that I do know, hopefully everyone does this.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.120
Okay, I'm out of here.

08:50.120 --> 08:50.680
I love you guys.
