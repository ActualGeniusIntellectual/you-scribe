0	7600	Hey guys, I'm making a quick short addendum to the How YouTube Sucks Better Help video.
7600	11520	At the end of the video, I said this, let's just listen to it again just so we're all
11520	12520	on the same page.
12520	15480	I know I'm a bit late on this one guys, thanks for listening anyway.
15480	18280	I can promise you right now, I'm never gonna sell you guys out.
18280	21780	I mean my description contains a Humble Bundle affiliate link, but that's a service that
21780	23680	I use and I actually think it's good.
23680	27520	And you won't see a paid ad on this channel for anything unless I've used it myself already.
27520	29160	Alright, that about does it for me.
29160	30520	I'll see you guys later.
30520	33600	I love you.
33600	38740	So I still for the most part stand by all of that, with the exception of the Humble
38740	43800	Bundle stuff because a bunch of people in the comments decided to drag me.
43800	45200	Let me just scroll through here.
45200	47720	Humble Bundle shill.
47720	49280	You got me.
49280	52680	Honest question, how do you endorse Humble Bundle with the way they funnel money to leftist
52680	54480	organizations such as the ACLU?
54480	58520	I actually didn't know about this when I made this video guys, this is news to me.
58520	60800	My bet is he did not know, I did not know.
60800	61800	Sargon knew.
61800	65520	Fun fact, Humble Bundle are owned by IGN and donating money to the LCAU.
65520	68440	Ah shit, see I didn't know.
68440	70040	Pour one out for Humble Bundle.
70040	73520	Humble Bundle is a terrible service, it floods your Steam library with hundreds of games,
73520	75720	what shall I do with it?
75720	79320	You mentioned you support Humble Bundle even though you support the ACLU.
79320	82840	Hasn't Humble Bundle been outed in some bullshit funneling money to the ACLU?
82840	84860	The quartering did a video on it.
84860	90340	See I didn't know, the quartering is a, not like a close friend, but a friend of mine
90340	94060	and I don't watch every single one of his videos unfortunately.
94060	96060	Doesn't Humble Bundle pay the ACLU?
96060	97060	Etc.
97060	98060	Etc.
98060	99060	Guys I didn't know.
99060	101140	I legitimately didn't know.
101140	105260	And I did watch the quarterings video before making this one so I have a rough idea of
105260	106260	what's going on.
106260	114500	Apparently IGN bought Humble Bundle and Humble Bundle has now been doing these various bundles
114500	120160	that support really shitty groups like the ACLU because the ACLU is a pretty shitty group
120160	121500	if you look into them.
121500	126220	And if you want to look into them go watch the quarterings video, it's a good video.
126220	132220	However the quartering states in that video that he's not a user of Humble Bundle and
132220	135340	he missed a few points that I want to bring up.
135340	138660	This is not necessarily a reply video to him though it kind of is.
138660	143760	This is not necessarily me defending Humble Bundle because very clearly it's indefensible
143760	148340	to support the ACLU like this and not tell people about it.
148340	154520	But I am going to maybe offer a reasonable justification as to why I won't be removing
154520	157120	my Humble Bundle affiliate link.
157120	160200	Even though frankly I don't think anyone's used it yet.
160200	164960	But let me just show you, I'll go through the process with you so that you can see what
164960	166620	exactly I'm talking about.
166620	171540	So I'm open on an incognito window so that I'm not logged into anything.
171540	175820	This is just an incognito window in Google Chrome.
175820	178500	Here's my Humble Bundle affiliate link.
178500	180960	It's right here, see?
180960	184620	Let's open that up in a new tab.
184620	192320	Because you've clicked on my partner link, you can actually do all of these various bundles
192320	193320	that they have going.
193320	194580	So let's do the gaming one.
194580	199820	It's the WB Games Classics Bundle.
199820	202980	Let's open that one up in a new link.
202980	208340	As you see, seven days remaining, you get Scribblenauts, Shadow of Mordor, Batman Arkham
208340	209540	Oranges, et cetera.
209540	211700	You pay more than the average of $4.13.
211700	213340	You also get these games.
213340	216520	You pay $12 or more and you get these games.
216520	218660	And this is all the stuff.
218660	224540	You get these various things partnered with Short Fight Otaku.
224540	230540	So something that people kind of know, but not necessarily, is that at the bottom here,
230540	235500	there's a tab that says choose where your money goes and you click this.
235500	239380	And if you didn't go through an affiliate link at all, let's just say that you were
239380	246320	just using Humble Bundle without any affiliate link active, you would see WB Games, Charity,
246320	247320	and Humble Tip.
247320	251220	And you can adjust these sliders to see how much of your money goes to certain places.
251220	256860	The charity this one has selected is Choose Charities, Be The Match, and Crisis Text Line.
256860	258900	And I think you can actually change these charities.
258900	260820	Is there a button to change it up here?
260820	261820	I think there was.
261820	262820	Let's see.
262820	263820	Yeah, yeah.
263820	265600	If you want to change charities, here's more charities.
265600	267100	You can select a new charity.
267100	271500	So you can, in fact, choose various charities if you want to donate money.
271500	274620	Now let's say you want a custom amount.
274620	276820	Let's say you're going to spend $25 in this bundle.
276820	277820	Okay.
277820	278820	It's already $25.
278820	279820	$25 is already in there.
279820	281900	$35, just so I can show you how this works.
281900	285220	So you decide to spend $35 in this bundle.
285220	290580	And look, it automatically calculates using these sliders, the percentage of which goes
290580	291580	to whoever.
291580	301320	So WB Games gets $21, the charities each get $1.75, Humble Bundle gets $525, and I would
301320	302900	get $525.
302900	307640	You could also, for example, make this charity get nothing, and then that one, it automatically
307640	308860	evens it out.
308900	312620	You could, in fact, just do this, and they're linked together because it's a proportional
312620	313980	thing.
313980	321900	You can also make the charity get nothing, and then the other three will adjust, right?
321900	325040	The other three will, and you can make WB Games get nothing.
325040	328920	So they're linked together in a proportional way.
328920	334620	So for example, if you really don't like Humble Bundle because of their ACLU bullshit, you
334620	336560	can just do this.
336560	340240	You can just give me all the money, right?
340240	346500	In this instance, you'll be buying these games, these Humble Bundle games, and I will get
346500	348820	every cent.
348820	353820	And because Humble Bundle is honestly so shitty, I would recommend that you do that.
353820	358480	If you are going to use my Humble Bundle affiliate link, and you want to support my channel in
358480	361240	doing so, just give me all the money.
361240	368800	It sounds a bit self-serving, and on some level it is, but it is a reasonable way to
368800	371220	fuck this company over.
371220	375260	I'm probably going to lose my affiliate link for saying this, but it's a good way to fuck
375260	381860	this company over for their shitty business practices and still support me.
381860	388240	If this wasn't allowed, if this option here to choose where your money goes didn't exist,
388240	390400	I would take down my link.
390400	394500	I would disable it, and I would no longer support Humble Bundle because they do seem
394500	396180	to be acting quite shitty.
396180	400740	Let's go back to the Humble Monthly, for example, and I'll show you what I mean.
400740	406060	This Get the Vote Out Bundle is what everyone is up in arms about right now, and here's
406060	407060	why.
407060	413380	These are all kind of SJW-style books, they're political books, you pay money to get all
413380	420020	these books, and as they say at the bottom, this is resist, as they say at the bottom,
420020	423260	it supports the charity of the ACLU.
423260	426680	There is no link to change the charity on this page.
426680	433820	If you keep going, you can still set your custom amount, but instead of a place to adjust
433820	439720	the ratios with those sliders, it just says, all for one, and one for all.
439720	445040	So if you're purchasing this bundle, everything goes to the ACLU, and you have no choice in
445040	446040	the matter.
446040	448840	I think that's a shitty business practice.
448840	457060	I have no intention of morally supporting Humble Bundle at all, ever.
457060	458060	You know what?
458060	463720	I don't know if it's possible for me to use my own affiliate link and then just give me
463720	465400	the money that I spend.
465400	466400	That'd be hilarious.
466400	469060	I don't mind doing that until it gets banned.
469060	475040	If it does get banned, I will use a friend's affiliate link, if I know a YouTuber has an
475040	479360	affiliate link, and I will just give them all the money using the sliders, I have no
479360	483760	intention of giving Humble Bundle a cent now that I've learned this.
483760	488180	However, because the bundles are a good deal, and because they give you this option to basically
488180	492040	exploit them, I'm going to exploit them until I'm banned.
492040	497360	And if you want an easy way to buy some games and support my show and support me and support
497360	502040	what I do here, I would suggest you exploit them as well until I'm banned.
502040	509360	But no, aside from basically fucking Humble Bundle in whatever small way that I can, I
509360	511240	no longer support this company.
511240	515360	Thank you guys for cluing me into the Quartering's video, thank you to the Quartering for making
515360	522480	that video, even though I think he missed this slider stuff here.
522480	525980	And I am sorry, I didn't know.
525980	528800	But now that I do know, hopefully everyone does this.
528800	530120	Okay, I'm out of here.
530120	530680	I love you guys.
