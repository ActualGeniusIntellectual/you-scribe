0	7720	So, Naomi and I have recently been watching The Orville, yes, I know, and the episode
7720	9580	Majority Rule came up.
9580	14360	Majority Rule features a planet with a 21st century level of development, ruled by an
14360	16600	absolute democracy form of government.
16600	21660	In other words, every single bit of government action is decided on by referendum, and because
21660	26360	the entire planet consists of one nation state, every single person can cast their vote on
26360	27620	every single topic.
27620	31860	In their culture, the truth of a subject is whatever won the popular vote.
31860	35940	And just in case you really needed the cultural commentary hammered home, every single person
35940	41720	is legally required to wear a badge on their shirt consisting of upvote and downvote buttons
41720	59960	that other people can push if they've done something good or bad.
59960	64000	Politicians are seen on TVs in the back under the episode, hitting up talk shows in order
64000	65720	to pitch their ideas to the public.
65720	70400	However, this process governs not only the creation of law, but also its application.
70400	74920	A picture of two men on a bus not noticing that they should be giving up their spot to
74920	77720	a pregnant woman beside them goes viral.
77720	81160	These men subsequently receive over a million downvotes.
81160	84840	When they reach 10 million, one of the men is corrected.
84840	87360	The other decides to run and is shot instead.
87360	90360	Okay, so this is Seth MacFarlane's show here.
90360	94480	This isn't exactly the deepest examination of our social media centered culture.
94480	96640	I think we all understand what's going on here.
96640	100940	In fact, I was personally more reminded of China's social credit scheme, where people
100940	105660	who don't act like good citizens have their rights restricted, even if they haven't actually
105660	108620	broken any laws or done anything immoral.
108620	113560	The radical left seems to believe that a social credit type system is a needed component in
113560	117960	the West, which is a topic I've already covered, and is also probably why they regularly praise
117960	119400	China for implementing it.
119400	125880	It's also why their arguments always boil down to, it's not illegal, but, or it's free speech,
125880	129400	but they don't understand that we don't want the state legislating morality, not only
129400	133240	because of the subjective components of morality, but also because of what the government after
133240	135400	they leave office will do with that power.
135400	139720	There's a lot of things that are, and should be, both immoral and still legal.
139720	143620	Hell, there are things that are unhealthy, yet still legal, and should be.
143620	147600	But the ending shot of Majority Rule features a character, having changed her mind about
147600	151320	her planet's system of governance after her encounter with the Orville's crew, turning
151320	154580	her TV off and refusing to participate in the voting system.
154580	157880	And at the beginning of the episode, she was happy to do her part in sentencing the
157880	161460	two men for correction without even knowing their stories, admitting that she just did
161460	171260	it because they look creepy.
171260	173720	The parting message, to me, is obvious.
173720	175540	Social media is rotting all of our brains, sure.
175540	180060	But more importantly, that mob rule is a terrible way to run things, and never actually meets
180060	181060	out justice.
181060	185780	The truth isn't defined by majority opinion, or by the opinions of those in power, or even
185780	189140	in some cases, by the opinions of the experts in the field.
189140	194140	The truth just is, in a sense, and the authority of those groups can't make a false statement
194140	196300	true, no matter how well-meaning they act.
196300	201340	When a video of an Orville crew member humping a statue goes viral, he gets a, get this,
201340	206860	publicity officer, and is forced to go on an apology tour in an effort to garner upvotes.
206860	211940	It's entirely fitting that the shows he's a guest on look like both The View and a hodgepodge
211940	216500	of various late-night comedy shows, run by celebrities with the proper politics and the
216500	221020	perfect canned responses, willing to chastise him in their own interview of him with no
221020	223220	hint of objectivity in their line of questioning.
223220	227580	It's equally fitting that this entire sequence plays out like every single social justice
227580	232240	cuck who gets caught doing something untoward, and has to beg their audiences for forgiveness
232240	236820	while talking about how truly woke and progressive they are, kinda like Egoraptor recently due
236820	237900	to his whole thing.
237900	241540	If you don't know what happened there, Egoraptor used to be a Newgrounds-centered animator
241540	245740	who made edgy humor, and became quite popular for being funny and talented.
245740	272380	He's used racial slurs in the past as part of his humor.
302380	328780	And he's admitted to surfing that lovable cesspool known as 4chan.
328780	333300	But like many other edgy content creators from 10 years ago, he has since morphed into
333300	338920	a spineless baby who completely disavows his old actions, his old works, his old communities,
338920	343320	and his old friends, and now spends time on social media shaming others for doing what
343320	344420	he used to do.
344420	349040	Now that he's made his fame, the methods he used should be entirely shut off from those
349040	352760	coming up behind him, because he now thinks they're problematic.
352760	357480	So when Serpilo released a viral video making fun of a sub-community on YouTube called The
357480	362600	Storytime Animators, Egoraptor chimed in talking about how the video was hurtful despite him
362600	367120	creating far worse in his prime, and the entire internet turned around and dragged him for
367120	368120	it.
368120	371760	Egoraptor's subsequent and predictable apology didn't even talk about what he actually
371760	375880	said regarding Serpilo's video, it was simply an apology for all the stuff he did a decade
375880	379240	ago, which people had been bringing up to highlight how much of a hypocrite he really
379240	380240	was.
380240	381600	And that's kinda the point here, isn't it?
381600	385200	Egoraptor didn't say a goddamn thing about the actual issues people have with him, selling
385200	389180	out his old values, becoming a cuck, virtue signaling and slagging others for doing what
389180	393360	he once did, abandoning his old haunts and turning on his old friend groups after he
393360	398080	finally made it big, and instead spent all of his time apologizing for his past actions,
398080	402000	when those past actions aren't actually all that questionable in context.
402000	405280	In The Orville, the apology tour is entirely fabricated as well.
405280	409120	The publicity agent just sets it up and instructs our guy to tell blatant lies in order to save
409120	410620	face and garner some upvotes.
410620	414460	The difference between Egoraptor and Majority Rule is that in Majority Rule, the stakes
414460	415760	are significantly higher.
415760	419320	But some people online act like the stakes really aren't, and this is where we finally
419320	422180	get to the title of the video, the downvote button itself.
422180	426740	Since the start of 2019, there's been this weird push to not only get rid of the downvote
426740	430780	buttons on YouTube and Facebook, but also the like button on Twitter, or hell, even
430780	432380	the follower counts on those sites.
432380	436820	I mean, I can see why the SJWs would want this, because they get ratioed constantly.
436820	441660	Look at stuff like YouTube Rewind or the Diablo Immortal trailer, or any time an SJW idiot
441660	443580	drops a retarded take on Twitter.
443580	445700	Mass downvotes and only a few upvotes.
445700	450260	Or in Twitter's case, thousands of replies and retweets with only tens of likes.
450260	453420	If you're somebody who doesn't want to know when people disagree with you, if you're
453420	456620	somebody that doesn't want the world to inform you that you have failed, then yes,
456620	458560	getting ratioed is probably uncomfortable.
458560	459960	It probably feels like harassment.
459960	463940	Of course, what it actually is, is the plebs letting you know that, despite all of your
463940	466820	power and influence, the masses do not agree with you.
466820	470020	They're not willing to do what you say, and they would rather revolt against you.
470060	474700	And let's be honest, to the tyrant, a peasant revolt probably feels similar to harassment,
474700	478060	because the tyrant believes it's the natural order for them to be in charge.
478060	482460	Just so we're clear, yes, I'm making a direct comparison to the obstinate child that
482460	486080	plugs their ears, and the dictator who oppresses the people with an iron fist.
486080	489780	Those two creatures are connected by their mutual disdain for reality's tendency to
489780	491420	rebel against their impositions.
491420	494660	And I would go so far to say that this recent push to abolish the ways in which people can
494660	498980	have their say, from disabling comments or voting on both news sites and left-leaning
498980	502820	YouTube channels, to agitating for the blanket removal of those features from all of social
502820	507420	media, to the removal of any objective metric of popularity, in order to blanket everyone
507420	512980	in a great equalization, or even worse, to only push approved sources, is yet another
512980	518140	way the idea of the obstinate child tyrant is being expressed in the modern world, albeit
518140	519140	less harshly.
519140	523020	But that's why the Orville made it a life-and-death situation in their commentary.
523020	527100	Because not only was it once one in years past, but because that's how these people
527100	528100	view it.
528220	532140	I mean, why do you think that people like Mundane Matt or Woz Lee want the dislike button
532140	535540	removed from YouTube entirely, especially when they have the option to simply disable
535540	536780	it on their own channels?
536780	541460	Why do you think Anita Sarkeesian or Lindsay Ellis simultaneously treat their own audiences
541460	544980	with disdain, while also talking about how terrified they are of them?
544980	548300	Of course, you can go on Twitter and find examples of people wanting a dislike button
548300	552400	on the platform, but only in relation to owning one of Donald Trump's tweets, or brigading
552400	554540	opponents of their own political opinions or something.
554540	558380	If Twitter did actually have a dislike button, these people would be really happy with it
558380	561860	until they notice that a chunk of the population disagrees with them and are willing to click
561860	562860	a button to show it.
562860	565820	Then the conversation would be all about demanding its removal again.
565820	568820	The tyrant believes that their rule is what nature intended.
568820	572620	The would-be tyrant believes that the people secretly wish for their rule while chafing
572620	574300	against the regime of a different tyrant.
574300	578060	And they both inevitably turn towards suppression when this idea is shown to be false.
578060	581180	It's why governments around the world put down people by the millions.
581180	585580	It's also why every single person I've spoken about today, and many, many more I
585580	590020	have not yet discussed, wants their audience to have less of a voice and not more.
590020	594020	It's the heart of the don't question it, just consume product and then wait for the
594020	595020	next product meme.
595020	598860	It's also why that meme was called racist and sexist and whatever.
598860	602580	That meme sarcastically sums up everything I've been talking about this entire video,
602580	606740	and the social justice reaction to that meme's traction only proves it to be true.
606740	610460	I brought up China's social credit system earlier because the radical left is beginning
610460	614580	to realize that if western governments won't do it, then business, academia, and social
614580	616100	media should in its stead.
616100	619940	When your workplace has diversity councils willing to police your behavior both on and
619940	624300	off the clock, when your school has diversity officers willing to police your behavior both
624300	628840	on and off campus, when social media has a terms of service willing to police your speech
628840	632140	both on and off platform, the government doesn't need to get involved.
632140	634500	The social credit system is already in place.
634500	638220	If you want to see the intended end result of that policy, just take another look at
638220	663780	the corrected individual from
693780	697420	the show.
697420	700900	In the show it's a literal lobotomy, but in real life it's a moral lobotomy.
700900	704060	They don't necessarily care if this is how we think, although if they can force us to
704060	708020	think like this, all the better, but their main goal is to get us to present like this.
708020	712500	To cleanse all of society such that only happiness and health remains, despite any evidence to
712500	713500	the contrary.
713500	715600	To compete in the grand virtue signal Olympics.
715600	719660	To perform and watch others perform in turn, in the hopes that if we swallow enough bullshit
719660	720780	we'll come to believe it.
720780	721780	Well, I refuse.
721780	724060	I don't care how many people hate me over it.
724060	727900	I will always choose flawed freedom over sanitized slavery.
