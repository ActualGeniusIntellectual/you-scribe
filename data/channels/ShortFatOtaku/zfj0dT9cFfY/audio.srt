1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
So, Naomi and I have recently been watching The Orville, yes, I know, and the episode

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,580
Majority Rule came up.

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,360
Majority Rule features a planet with a 21st century level of development, ruled by an

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,600
absolute democracy form of government.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,660
In other words, every single bit of government action is decided on by referendum, and because

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,360
the entire planet consists of one nation state, every single person can cast their vote on

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,620
every single topic.

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,860
In their culture, the truth of a subject is whatever won the popular vote.

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,940
And just in case you really needed the cultural commentary hammered home, every single person

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,720
is legally required to wear a badge on their shirt consisting of upvote and downvote buttons

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:59,960
that other people can push if they've done something good or bad.

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,000
Politicians are seen on TVs in the back under the episode, hitting up talk shows in order

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,720
to pitch their ideas to the public.

14
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,400
However, this process governs not only the creation of law, but also its application.

15
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,920
A picture of two men on a bus not noticing that they should be giving up their spot to

16
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,720
a pregnant woman beside them goes viral.

17
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,160
These men subsequently receive over a million downvotes.

18
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,840
When they reach 10 million, one of the men is corrected.

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,360
The other decides to run and is shot instead.

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,360
Okay, so this is Seth MacFarlane's show here.

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,480
This isn't exactly the deepest examination of our social media centered culture.

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,640
I think we all understand what's going on here.

23
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,940
In fact, I was personally more reminded of China's social credit scheme, where people

24
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,660
who don't act like good citizens have their rights restricted, even if they haven't actually

25
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,620
broken any laws or done anything immoral.

26
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,560
The radical left seems to believe that a social credit type system is a needed component in

27
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,960
the West, which is a topic I've already covered, and is also probably why they regularly praise

28
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,400
China for implementing it.

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,880
It's also why their arguments always boil down to, it's not illegal, but, or it's free speech,

30
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,400
but they don't understand that we don't want the state legislating morality, not only

31
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,240
because of the subjective components of morality, but also because of what the government after

32
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,400
they leave office will do with that power.

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,720
There's a lot of things that are, and should be, both immoral and still legal.

34
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,620
Hell, there are things that are unhealthy, yet still legal, and should be.

35
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,600
But the ending shot of Majority Rule features a character, having changed her mind about

36
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,320
her planet's system of governance after her encounter with the Orville's crew, turning

37
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,580
her TV off and refusing to participate in the voting system.

38
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,880
And at the beginning of the episode, she was happy to do her part in sentencing the

39
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,460
two men for correction without even knowing their stories, admitting that she just did

40
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:51,260
it because they look creepy.

41
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,720
The parting message, to me, is obvious.

42
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,540
Social media is rotting all of our brains, sure.

43
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,060
But more importantly, that mob rule is a terrible way to run things, and never actually meets

44
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,060
out justice.

45
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,780
The truth isn't defined by majority opinion, or by the opinions of those in power, or even

46
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,140
in some cases, by the opinions of the experts in the field.

47
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,140
The truth just is, in a sense, and the authority of those groups can't make a false statement

48
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,300
true, no matter how well-meaning they act.

49
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,340
When a video of an Orville crew member humping a statue goes viral, he gets a, get this,

50
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:26,860
publicity officer, and is forced to go on an apology tour in an effort to garner upvotes.

51
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,940
It's entirely fitting that the shows he's a guest on look like both The View and a hodgepodge

52
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,500
of various late-night comedy shows, run by celebrities with the proper politics and the

53
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,020
perfect canned responses, willing to chastise him in their own interview of him with no

54
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,220
hint of objectivity in their line of questioning.

55
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,580
It's equally fitting that this entire sequence plays out like every single social justice

56
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,240
cuck who gets caught doing something untoward, and has to beg their audiences for forgiveness

57
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,820
while talking about how truly woke and progressive they are, kinda like Egoraptor recently due

58
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,900
to his whole thing.

59
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,540
If you don't know what happened there, Egoraptor used to be a Newgrounds-centered animator

60
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,740
who made edgy humor, and became quite popular for being funny and talented.

61
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:32,380
He's used racial slurs in the past as part of his humor.

62
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:28,780
And he's admitted to surfing that lovable cesspool known as 4chan.

63
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,300
But like many other edgy content creators from 10 years ago, he has since morphed into

64
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,920
a spineless baby who completely disavows his old actions, his old works, his old communities,

65
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,320
and his old friends, and now spends time on social media shaming others for doing what

66
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,420
he used to do.

67
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,040
Now that he's made his fame, the methods he used should be entirely shut off from those

68
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,760
coming up behind him, because he now thinks they're problematic.

69
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,480
So when Serpilo released a viral video making fun of a sub-community on YouTube called The

70
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,600
Storytime Animators, Egoraptor chimed in talking about how the video was hurtful despite him

71
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,120
creating far worse in his prime, and the entire internet turned around and dragged him for

72
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
it.

73
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,760
Egoraptor's subsequent and predictable apology didn't even talk about what he actually

74
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,880
said regarding Serpilo's video, it was simply an apology for all the stuff he did a decade

75
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,240
ago, which people had been bringing up to highlight how much of a hypocrite he really

76
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
was.

77
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,600
And that's kinda the point here, isn't it?

78
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,200
Egoraptor didn't say a goddamn thing about the actual issues people have with him, selling

79
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,180
out his old values, becoming a cuck, virtue signaling and slagging others for doing what

80
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,360
he once did, abandoning his old haunts and turning on his old friend groups after he

81
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,080
finally made it big, and instead spent all of his time apologizing for his past actions,

82
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,000
when those past actions aren't actually all that questionable in context.

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,280
In The Orville, the apology tour is entirely fabricated as well.

84
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,120
The publicity agent just sets it up and instructs our guy to tell blatant lies in order to save

85
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,620
face and garner some upvotes.

86
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,460
The difference between Egoraptor and Majority Rule is that in Majority Rule, the stakes

87
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,760
are significantly higher.

88
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,320
But some people online act like the stakes really aren't, and this is where we finally

89
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,180
get to the title of the video, the downvote button itself.

90
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,740
Since the start of 2019, there's been this weird push to not only get rid of the downvote

91
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,780
buttons on YouTube and Facebook, but also the like button on Twitter, or hell, even

92
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,380
the follower counts on those sites.

93
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,820
I mean, I can see why the SJWs would want this, because they get ratioed constantly.

94
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,660
Look at stuff like YouTube Rewind or the Diablo Immortal trailer, or any time an SJW idiot

95
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,580
drops a retarded take on Twitter.

96
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,700
Mass downvotes and only a few upvotes.

97
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,260
Or in Twitter's case, thousands of replies and retweets with only tens of likes.

98
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,420
If you're somebody who doesn't want to know when people disagree with you, if you're

99
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,620
somebody that doesn't want the world to inform you that you have failed, then yes,

100
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,560
getting ratioed is probably uncomfortable.

101
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,960
It probably feels like harassment.

102
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,940
Of course, what it actually is, is the plebs letting you know that, despite all of your

103
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,820
power and influence, the masses do not agree with you.

104
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,020
They're not willing to do what you say, and they would rather revolt against you.

105
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,700
And let's be honest, to the tyrant, a peasant revolt probably feels similar to harassment,

106
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,060
because the tyrant believes it's the natural order for them to be in charge.

107
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,460
Just so we're clear, yes, I'm making a direct comparison to the obstinate child that

108
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,080
plugs their ears, and the dictator who oppresses the people with an iron fist.

109
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,780
Those two creatures are connected by their mutual disdain for reality's tendency to

110
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,420
rebel against their impositions.

111
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,660
And I would go so far to say that this recent push to abolish the ways in which people can

112
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,980
have their say, from disabling comments or voting on both news sites and left-leaning

113
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,820
YouTube channels, to agitating for the blanket removal of those features from all of social

114
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,420
media, to the removal of any objective metric of popularity, in order to blanket everyone

115
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:32,980
in a great equalization, or even worse, to only push approved sources, is yet another

116
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:38,140
way the idea of the obstinate child tyrant is being expressed in the modern world, albeit

117
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,140
less harshly.

118
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,020
But that's why the Orville made it a life-and-death situation in their commentary.

119
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,100
Because not only was it once one in years past, but because that's how these people

120
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,100
view it.

121
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,140
I mean, why do you think that people like Mundane Matt or Woz Lee want the dislike button

122
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,540
removed from YouTube entirely, especially when they have the option to simply disable

123
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,780
it on their own channels?

124
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:01,460
Why do you think Anita Sarkeesian or Lindsay Ellis simultaneously treat their own audiences

125
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,980
with disdain, while also talking about how terrified they are of them?

126
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,300
Of course, you can go on Twitter and find examples of people wanting a dislike button

127
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,400
on the platform, but only in relation to owning one of Donald Trump's tweets, or brigading

128
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,540
opponents of their own political opinions or something.

129
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,380
If Twitter did actually have a dislike button, these people would be really happy with it

130
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,860
until they notice that a chunk of the population disagrees with them and are willing to click

131
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,860
a button to show it.

132
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,820
Then the conversation would be all about demanding its removal again.

133
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,820
The tyrant believes that their rule is what nature intended.

134
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,620
The would-be tyrant believes that the people secretly wish for their rule while chafing

135
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,300
against the regime of a different tyrant.

136
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,060
And they both inevitably turn towards suppression when this idea is shown to be false.

137
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,180
It's why governments around the world put down people by the millions.

138
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,580
It's also why every single person I've spoken about today, and many, many more I

139
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,020
have not yet discussed, wants their audience to have less of a voice and not more.

140
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,020
It's the heart of the don't question it, just consume product and then wait for the

141
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,020
next product meme.

142
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,860
It's also why that meme was called racist and sexist and whatever.

143
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,580
That meme sarcastically sums up everything I've been talking about this entire video,

144
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,740
and the social justice reaction to that meme's traction only proves it to be true.

145
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,460
I brought up China's social credit system earlier because the radical left is beginning

146
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,580
to realize that if western governments won't do it, then business, academia, and social

147
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,100
media should in its stead.

148
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,940
When your workplace has diversity councils willing to police your behavior both on and

149
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,300
off the clock, when your school has diversity officers willing to police your behavior both

150
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,840
on and off campus, when social media has a terms of service willing to police your speech

151
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,140
both on and off platform, the government doesn't need to get involved.

152
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,500
The social credit system is already in place.

153
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,220
If you want to see the intended end result of that policy, just take another look at

154
00:10:38,220 --> 00:11:03,780
the corrected individual from

155
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,420
the show.

156
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,900
In the show it's a literal lobotomy, but in real life it's a moral lobotomy.

157
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,060
They don't necessarily care if this is how we think, although if they can force us to

158
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,020
think like this, all the better, but their main goal is to get us to present like this.

159
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,500
To cleanse all of society such that only happiness and health remains, despite any evidence to

160
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
the contrary.

161
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,600
To compete in the grand virtue signal Olympics.

162
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,660
To perform and watch others perform in turn, in the hopes that if we swallow enough bullshit

163
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,780
we'll come to believe it.

164
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,780
Well, I refuse.

165
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,060
I don't care how many people hate me over it.

166
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,900
I will always choose flawed freedom over sanitized slavery.
