00:00.000 --> 00:07.720
So, Naomi and I have recently been watching The Orville, yes, I know, and the episode

00:07.720 --> 00:09.580
Majority Rule came up.

00:09.580 --> 00:14.360
Majority Rule features a planet with a 21st century level of development, ruled by an

00:14.360 --> 00:16.600
absolute democracy form of government.

00:16.600 --> 00:21.660
In other words, every single bit of government action is decided on by referendum, and because

00:21.660 --> 00:26.360
the entire planet consists of one nation state, every single person can cast their vote on

00:26.360 --> 00:27.620
every single topic.

00:27.620 --> 00:31.860
In their culture, the truth of a subject is whatever won the popular vote.

00:31.860 --> 00:35.940
And just in case you really needed the cultural commentary hammered home, every single person

00:35.940 --> 00:41.720
is legally required to wear a badge on their shirt consisting of upvote and downvote buttons

00:41.720 --> 00:59.960
that other people can push if they've done something good or bad.

00:59.960 --> 01:04.000
Politicians are seen on TVs in the back under the episode, hitting up talk shows in order

01:04.000 --> 01:05.720
to pitch their ideas to the public.

01:05.720 --> 01:10.400
However, this process governs not only the creation of law, but also its application.

01:10.400 --> 01:14.920
A picture of two men on a bus not noticing that they should be giving up their spot to

01:14.920 --> 01:17.720
a pregnant woman beside them goes viral.

01:17.720 --> 01:21.160
These men subsequently receive over a million downvotes.

01:21.160 --> 01:24.840
When they reach 10 million, one of the men is corrected.

01:24.840 --> 01:27.360
The other decides to run and is shot instead.

01:27.360 --> 01:30.360
Okay, so this is Seth MacFarlane's show here.

01:30.360 --> 01:34.480
This isn't exactly the deepest examination of our social media centered culture.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.640
I think we all understand what's going on here.

01:36.640 --> 01:40.940
In fact, I was personally more reminded of China's social credit scheme, where people

01:40.940 --> 01:45.660
who don't act like good citizens have their rights restricted, even if they haven't actually

01:45.660 --> 01:48.620
broken any laws or done anything immoral.

01:48.620 --> 01:53.560
The radical left seems to believe that a social credit type system is a needed component in

01:53.560 --> 01:57.960
the West, which is a topic I've already covered, and is also probably why they regularly praise

01:57.960 --> 01:59.400
China for implementing it.

01:59.400 --> 02:05.880
It's also why their arguments always boil down to, it's not illegal, but, or it's free speech,

02:05.880 --> 02:09.400
but they don't understand that we don't want the state legislating morality, not only

02:09.400 --> 02:13.240
because of the subjective components of morality, but also because of what the government after

02:13.240 --> 02:15.400
they leave office will do with that power.

02:15.400 --> 02:19.720
There's a lot of things that are, and should be, both immoral and still legal.

02:19.720 --> 02:23.620
Hell, there are things that are unhealthy, yet still legal, and should be.

02:23.620 --> 02:27.600
But the ending shot of Majority Rule features a character, having changed her mind about

02:27.600 --> 02:31.320
her planet's system of governance after her encounter with the Orville's crew, turning

02:31.320 --> 02:34.580
her TV off and refusing to participate in the voting system.

02:34.580 --> 02:37.880
And at the beginning of the episode, she was happy to do her part in sentencing the

02:37.880 --> 02:41.460
two men for correction without even knowing their stories, admitting that she just did

02:41.460 --> 02:51.260
it because they look creepy.

02:51.260 --> 02:53.720
The parting message, to me, is obvious.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.540
Social media is rotting all of our brains, sure.

02:55.540 --> 03:00.060
But more importantly, that mob rule is a terrible way to run things, and never actually meets

03:00.060 --> 03:01.060
out justice.

03:01.060 --> 03:05.780
The truth isn't defined by majority opinion, or by the opinions of those in power, or even

03:05.780 --> 03:09.140
in some cases, by the opinions of the experts in the field.

03:09.140 --> 03:14.140
The truth just is, in a sense, and the authority of those groups can't make a false statement

03:14.140 --> 03:16.300
true, no matter how well-meaning they act.

03:16.300 --> 03:21.340
When a video of an Orville crew member humping a statue goes viral, he gets a, get this,

03:21.340 --> 03:26.860
publicity officer, and is forced to go on an apology tour in an effort to garner upvotes.

03:26.860 --> 03:31.940
It's entirely fitting that the shows he's a guest on look like both The View and a hodgepodge

03:31.940 --> 03:36.500
of various late-night comedy shows, run by celebrities with the proper politics and the

03:36.500 --> 03:41.020
perfect canned responses, willing to chastise him in their own interview of him with no

03:41.020 --> 03:43.220
hint of objectivity in their line of questioning.

03:43.220 --> 03:47.580
It's equally fitting that this entire sequence plays out like every single social justice

03:47.580 --> 03:52.240
cuck who gets caught doing something untoward, and has to beg their audiences for forgiveness

03:52.240 --> 03:56.820
while talking about how truly woke and progressive they are, kinda like Egoraptor recently due

03:56.820 --> 03:57.900
to his whole thing.

03:57.900 --> 04:01.540
If you don't know what happened there, Egoraptor used to be a Newgrounds-centered animator

04:01.540 --> 04:05.740
who made edgy humor, and became quite popular for being funny and talented.

04:05.740 --> 04:32.380
He's used racial slurs in the past as part of his humor.

05:02.380 --> 05:28.780
And he's admitted to surfing that lovable cesspool known as 4chan.

05:28.780 --> 05:33.300
But like many other edgy content creators from 10 years ago, he has since morphed into

05:33.300 --> 05:38.920
a spineless baby who completely disavows his old actions, his old works, his old communities,

05:38.920 --> 05:43.320
and his old friends, and now spends time on social media shaming others for doing what

05:43.320 --> 05:44.420
he used to do.

05:44.420 --> 05:49.040
Now that he's made his fame, the methods he used should be entirely shut off from those

05:49.040 --> 05:52.760
coming up behind him, because he now thinks they're problematic.

05:52.760 --> 05:57.480
So when Serpilo released a viral video making fun of a sub-community on YouTube called The

05:57.480 --> 06:02.600
Storytime Animators, Egoraptor chimed in talking about how the video was hurtful despite him

06:02.600 --> 06:07.120
creating far worse in his prime, and the entire internet turned around and dragged him for

06:07.120 --> 06:08.120
it.

06:08.120 --> 06:11.760
Egoraptor's subsequent and predictable apology didn't even talk about what he actually

06:11.760 --> 06:15.880
said regarding Serpilo's video, it was simply an apology for all the stuff he did a decade

06:15.880 --> 06:19.240
ago, which people had been bringing up to highlight how much of a hypocrite he really

06:19.240 --> 06:20.240
was.

06:20.240 --> 06:21.600
And that's kinda the point here, isn't it?

06:21.600 --> 06:25.200
Egoraptor didn't say a goddamn thing about the actual issues people have with him, selling

06:25.200 --> 06:29.180
out his old values, becoming a cuck, virtue signaling and slagging others for doing what

06:29.180 --> 06:33.360
he once did, abandoning his old haunts and turning on his old friend groups after he

06:33.360 --> 06:38.080
finally made it big, and instead spent all of his time apologizing for his past actions,

06:38.080 --> 06:42.000
when those past actions aren't actually all that questionable in context.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.280
In The Orville, the apology tour is entirely fabricated as well.

06:45.280 --> 06:49.120
The publicity agent just sets it up and instructs our guy to tell blatant lies in order to save

06:49.120 --> 06:50.620
face and garner some upvotes.

06:50.620 --> 06:54.460
The difference between Egoraptor and Majority Rule is that in Majority Rule, the stakes

06:54.460 --> 06:55.760
are significantly higher.

06:55.760 --> 06:59.320
But some people online act like the stakes really aren't, and this is where we finally

06:59.320 --> 07:02.180
get to the title of the video, the downvote button itself.

07:02.180 --> 07:06.740
Since the start of 2019, there's been this weird push to not only get rid of the downvote

07:06.740 --> 07:10.780
buttons on YouTube and Facebook, but also the like button on Twitter, or hell, even

07:10.780 --> 07:12.380
the follower counts on those sites.

07:12.380 --> 07:16.820
I mean, I can see why the SJWs would want this, because they get ratioed constantly.

07:16.820 --> 07:21.660
Look at stuff like YouTube Rewind or the Diablo Immortal trailer, or any time an SJW idiot

07:21.660 --> 07:23.580
drops a retarded take on Twitter.

07:23.580 --> 07:25.700
Mass downvotes and only a few upvotes.

07:25.700 --> 07:30.260
Or in Twitter's case, thousands of replies and retweets with only tens of likes.

07:30.260 --> 07:33.420
If you're somebody who doesn't want to know when people disagree with you, if you're

07:33.420 --> 07:36.620
somebody that doesn't want the world to inform you that you have failed, then yes,

07:36.620 --> 07:38.560
getting ratioed is probably uncomfortable.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.960
It probably feels like harassment.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.940
Of course, what it actually is, is the plebs letting you know that, despite all of your

07:43.940 --> 07:46.820
power and influence, the masses do not agree with you.

07:46.820 --> 07:50.020
They're not willing to do what you say, and they would rather revolt against you.

07:50.060 --> 07:54.700
And let's be honest, to the tyrant, a peasant revolt probably feels similar to harassment,

07:54.700 --> 07:58.060
because the tyrant believes it's the natural order for them to be in charge.

07:58.060 --> 08:02.460
Just so we're clear, yes, I'm making a direct comparison to the obstinate child that

08:02.460 --> 08:06.080
plugs their ears, and the dictator who oppresses the people with an iron fist.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.780
Those two creatures are connected by their mutual disdain for reality's tendency to

08:09.780 --> 08:11.420
rebel against their impositions.

08:11.420 --> 08:14.660
And I would go so far to say that this recent push to abolish the ways in which people can

08:14.660 --> 08:18.980
have their say, from disabling comments or voting on both news sites and left-leaning

08:18.980 --> 08:22.820
YouTube channels, to agitating for the blanket removal of those features from all of social

08:22.820 --> 08:27.420
media, to the removal of any objective metric of popularity, in order to blanket everyone

08:27.420 --> 08:32.980
in a great equalization, or even worse, to only push approved sources, is yet another

08:32.980 --> 08:38.140
way the idea of the obstinate child tyrant is being expressed in the modern world, albeit

08:38.140 --> 08:39.140
less harshly.

08:39.140 --> 08:43.020
But that's why the Orville made it a life-and-death situation in their commentary.

08:43.020 --> 08:47.100
Because not only was it once one in years past, but because that's how these people

08:47.100 --> 08:48.100
view it.

08:48.220 --> 08:52.140
I mean, why do you think that people like Mundane Matt or Woz Lee want the dislike button

08:52.140 --> 08:55.540
removed from YouTube entirely, especially when they have the option to simply disable

08:55.540 --> 08:56.780
it on their own channels?

08:56.780 --> 09:01.460
Why do you think Anita Sarkeesian or Lindsay Ellis simultaneously treat their own audiences

09:01.460 --> 09:04.980
with disdain, while also talking about how terrified they are of them?

09:04.980 --> 09:08.300
Of course, you can go on Twitter and find examples of people wanting a dislike button

09:08.300 --> 09:12.400
on the platform, but only in relation to owning one of Donald Trump's tweets, or brigading

09:12.400 --> 09:14.540
opponents of their own political opinions or something.

09:14.540 --> 09:18.380
If Twitter did actually have a dislike button, these people would be really happy with it

09:18.380 --> 09:21.860
until they notice that a chunk of the population disagrees with them and are willing to click

09:21.860 --> 09:22.860
a button to show it.

09:22.860 --> 09:25.820
Then the conversation would be all about demanding its removal again.

09:25.820 --> 09:28.820
The tyrant believes that their rule is what nature intended.

09:28.820 --> 09:32.620
The would-be tyrant believes that the people secretly wish for their rule while chafing

09:32.620 --> 09:34.300
against the regime of a different tyrant.

09:34.300 --> 09:38.060
And they both inevitably turn towards suppression when this idea is shown to be false.

09:38.060 --> 09:41.180
It's why governments around the world put down people by the millions.

09:41.180 --> 09:45.580
It's also why every single person I've spoken about today, and many, many more I

09:45.580 --> 09:50.020
have not yet discussed, wants their audience to have less of a voice and not more.

09:50.020 --> 09:54.020
It's the heart of the don't question it, just consume product and then wait for the

09:54.020 --> 09:55.020
next product meme.

09:55.020 --> 09:58.860
It's also why that meme was called racist and sexist and whatever.

09:58.860 --> 10:02.580
That meme sarcastically sums up everything I've been talking about this entire video,

10:02.580 --> 10:06.740
and the social justice reaction to that meme's traction only proves it to be true.

10:06.740 --> 10:10.460
I brought up China's social credit system earlier because the radical left is beginning

10:10.460 --> 10:14.580
to realize that if western governments won't do it, then business, academia, and social

10:14.580 --> 10:16.100
media should in its stead.

10:16.100 --> 10:19.940
When your workplace has diversity councils willing to police your behavior both on and

10:19.940 --> 10:24.300
off the clock, when your school has diversity officers willing to police your behavior both

10:24.300 --> 10:28.840
on and off campus, when social media has a terms of service willing to police your speech

10:28.840 --> 10:32.140
both on and off platform, the government doesn't need to get involved.

10:32.140 --> 10:34.500
The social credit system is already in place.

10:34.500 --> 10:38.220
If you want to see the intended end result of that policy, just take another look at

10:38.220 --> 11:03.780
the corrected individual from

11:33.780 --> 11:37.420
the show.

11:37.420 --> 11:40.900
In the show it's a literal lobotomy, but in real life it's a moral lobotomy.

11:40.900 --> 11:44.060
They don't necessarily care if this is how we think, although if they can force us to

11:44.060 --> 11:48.020
think like this, all the better, but their main goal is to get us to present like this.

11:48.020 --> 11:52.500
To cleanse all of society such that only happiness and health remains, despite any evidence to

11:52.500 --> 11:53.500
the contrary.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.600
To compete in the grand virtue signal Olympics.

11:55.600 --> 11:59.660
To perform and watch others perform in turn, in the hopes that if we swallow enough bullshit

11:59.660 --> 12:00.780
we'll come to believe it.

12:00.780 --> 12:01.780
Well, I refuse.

12:01.780 --> 12:04.060
I don't care how many people hate me over it.

12:04.060 --> 12:07.900
I will always choose flawed freedom over sanitized slavery.
