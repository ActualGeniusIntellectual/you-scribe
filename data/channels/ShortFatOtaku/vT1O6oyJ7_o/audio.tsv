0	7440	Alright my friends, this one's going to be a quickie.
7440	11680	I do have some other larger, meatier videos coming out, but they're requiring a lot of
11680	15240	reading and a lot of research, so I figure just to tide us over I'll do something stupid
15240	18480	like this, since this is what currently passes for news right now.
18480	23920	Crowdsurge kills 8 at Travis Scott's AstroWorld Festival concert in Houston.
23920	27440	Gonna be honest, never heard of AstroWorld, never heard of Travis Scott.
27440	34680	Okay, he's a rapper, and I don't give a shit about rap whatsoever.
34680	38160	Wait, partner Kylie Jenner?
38160	47440	I get that confused with Caitlyn Jenner.
47440	50080	But okay, musician, got it.
50080	54600	Crowdsurge kills 8 at Travis Scott's AstroWorld Festival concert in Houston.
54600	55600	Holy shit.
55600	59120	People attending a Houston music festival surged towards the stage during a performance
59120	62560	by rapper Travis Scott, triggering panic in the crowd of tens of thousands.
62560	65400	At least 8 people were killed and many more hurt.
65400	69880	The ages of victims identified by authorities so far range from 14 to 27.
69880	71320	One person's age was unknown.
71320	73520	A 10 year old is in critical condition.
73520	75240	Jesus Christ.
75240	79720	Gotta be honest, I've never gone to a concert, never really felt the urge to go to one.
79720	82560	Never really understood the concert culture or concert mentality.
82560	85520	To me, music, while it can be very good, is something that you listen to while you're
85520	86520	doing other things.
86520	89680	I don't really view music as a primary activity personally.
89680	93020	Maybe that's because I like shows and movies and video games too much, you know?
93020	97240	By the way, this video is probably going to be marked not safe for work and also demonetized
97240	98680	due to the content within it.
98680	100600	So please consider supporting the channel guys.
100600	104180	But yeah, we've got lots of footage from the show.
104180	107320	Footage of fans trying to stop the show as people were dying in the crowd.
107320	110720	I mean, I know you can't just walk onto a stage or walk onto one of the other viewing
110720	132920	platforms but shit man, people were dying.
132920	138160	There's footage of people bailing the fuck out, running in a giant herd, with police
138160	153640	and security.
153640	156440	Holy fuck dude, no one's sticking around for this.
156440	164040	I don't blame them.
164040	175200	For some reason security starts fucking with people, like what the hell man?
175200	179360	This security guy, he's been good the whole time, he just starts stopping people, what
179360	182120	the fuck?
182120	195240	Looks like the horses are kind of spooked at you, they don't know what the fuck to do.
195240	197520	Oh shit, they took the barricades down.
197520	204420	Oh man, imagine the last thing that you hear is this guy's shitty rap as he does the robot
204420	207440	while your cooling corpse is getting worked on.
207440	208440	Jesus.
208520	212160	God, I know I shouldn't be laughing but there's just some gallows humor to this.
212160	217200	You got multiple dudes getting CPR done to them, to the beat of the song.
217200	219280	Here's a comment from somebody who was there.
219280	221240	Everyone crowd surfing was trying to breathe.
221240	225820	I was eight people away from a VIP barricade telling them my girlfriend was suffocating
225820	227320	and was going to die.
227320	230320	Some people just rolled their eyes at me while VIP recorded.
230320	233800	Scariest shit ever when you realize Travis is still performing and nobody gives a fuck
233800	234800	about you.
234800	236920	Me and my GF really thought that's how we were going to go out.
236920	239760	I'm so surprised only eight people died, it felt like it would have been hundreds.
239760	242600	I'm so thankful to the few who listened to me and helped pull my girlfriend out.
242600	246240	We were trying to get out for four songs, nobody deserves to suffocate in a crowd like
246240	247240	that.
247240	249520	All I could think of in the end were the people still stuck in that crowd, suffering while
249520	251720	I watched Travis perform back to back to back.
251720	255880	Now every time I listen to a Travis song, all I hear is animalistic screams from the
255880	257360	people getting crushed.
257360	258360	Jesus.
258360	263920	If you ever wondered why I'm not interested in going to a concert, I guess here it is.
263920	267920	It might sound counterintuitive, but you could actually die standing up in a crowd
267920	270380	assuming that the people are tightly packed enough.
270380	274340	It can get to a point where you can no longer control where you're moving because the forces
274340	276320	of all the other people around you, they're pushing you around.
276320	279920	It can get to the point where your chest is compressed enough that you can't really breathe
279920	280920	anymore.
280920	284240	And if you fall over, you're likely to be either trampled by others or cause a domino
284240	288320	effect where everybody else falls on top of you and you die underneath a pile of people.
288320	290580	Crowds are pretty dangerous guys.
290580	293900	So this wasn't unique to this Travis caught performance.
293900	296580	Apparently he's done some weird stuff on stage multiple times.
296580	300220	For example, he likes to treat the staff at his own concerts like shit.
300220	305220	Hey, hey, hey, get your fucking nerdy ass off the stage, bro.
305220	306220	Go.
306220	307220	Now.
307220	308220	You.
308220	309220	Off.
309220	310220	Yes.
310220	311220	I don't know you, bro.
311220	312220	Go, go, go.
312220	313220	Nobody on stage, bro.
313220	314220	Nobody on stage, bro.
314220	315220	No disrespect.
315220	316220	I'm an artist.
316220	317220	I don't know.
317220	318220	I don't know.
318220	319220	I don't care if you're working for Summer Jam.
319220	320220	Bye.
320860	321860	That's another video isn't at play, right?
321860	322860	It's another video.
322860	326980	It's unfortunately been taken down because Twitter decided to ban the account that posted
326980	331980	it, presumably for posting this because the content of the video was reasonably disturbing.
331980	336900	But this video showed Travis Scott jumping into a mosh pit, being crowd surfed, all the
336900	339940	while telling the crowd to attack other people.
339940	343940	And he would point out while he's crowd surfing around, he would point with his hands at other
343940	344940	people and say, get that guy.
344940	345940	Wait, wait, wait.
345940	349300	While I was editing this video, I actually managed to find what I was talking about.
349380	354140	And it turns out the reason he was asking the crowd to attack people is because the
354140	356140	guy stole his shoes.
356140	358140	Come here, bitch.
363140	364140	Get that motherfucker.
364140	365140	Get him.
368140	370140	You tried to take my shoes?
370140	372140	You want to be a thief?
372140	373140	Fuck him up.
373140	374140	Fuck him up.
374140	375140	Fuck him up.
376140	377140	Also, apparently he's homophobic.
377980	381980	I ain't cool with none of you faggots who just sitting here looking like a bunch of queers.
385980	387980	You wearing a fucking La Flame shirt, motherfucker.
387980	388980	Then you better act like it, bitch.
388980	390980	I'm gonna rip it off your fucking back.
393980	394980	Based.
394980	397980	No, but really, though, it does seem like Travis Scott is kind of a piece of shit.
397980	401980	And the only reason that he decided to put out a statement is because this went viral.
401980	404980	I'm absolutely devastated by what took place last night.
405820	408820	My prayers go out to the families and all those impacted by what happened at Astro World
408820	409820	Festival.
409820	412540	Houston Police Department has my total support as they continue to look into the tragic loss
412540	413540	of life.
413540	415820	I'm committed to working together with the Houston community to heal and support the
415820	416820	families in need.
416820	417820	No, you're not.
417820	418820	You're already on a plane out of there, dude.
418820	422140	Thank you to Houston PD, Fire Department, and NRG Park for their immediate response
422140	423140	and support.
423140	424140	Love you all.
424140	425140	Holy fuck, dude.
425140	429260	The thing is, from what I understand, Travis Scott seems to have a history of doing this
429260	434100	sort of thing, of hyping up the crowd to the point that they actually begin to engage in
434100	437780	crowd crushes, where the entire crowd moves forward.
437780	441660	And so the people in the center of the crowd have no choice but to keep moving forward
441660	444460	because they're being pushed by momentum, which then pushes the people in front of them,
444460	446060	which then crushes the crowd.
446060	447060	He's encouraged violence.
447060	450540	He already has a charge on his record for inciting a riot.
450540	455120	He's even been deleting tweets on his official account, where he talks about bringing in
455120	459180	ragers and stuff, you know, people who will actually hype a crowd up to that dangerous
459180	460180	level.
460180	463480	And it's not like the music industry doesn't have examples of people who, when they were
463520	468080	giving performances and they saw something happening in the crowd, did the right thing
468080	469080	and stopped the show.
469080	471080	You've got musicians who have stopped fights.
493480	502480	Who have stopped people from being sexually assaulted in the crowd.
523480	532480	Who have stopped the show to help people who've fallen over in the crowd.
553480	564480	Who have used the stage to make sure that people who are having some kind of medical
564480	583160	emergency during the show get access to some kind of help.
583160	588760	This is not just an on-with-the-show mentality, because the pros who understand what position
588760	591400	they're in and actually care about their fans, they do this sort of stuff.
591400	593520	And of course there's just some weirdness coming out of this.
593520	598160	Astro World Security pricked a neck with needle, says the Houston police.
598160	602880	What the f- At least one person had been injected with something via needle.
602880	606840	A security guard was working the event, and he felt a prick in his neck by an unknown
606840	610120	assailant while he was trying to restrain a citizen, and he quickly fell unconscious.
610120	613960	No personnel did indeed see something on his neck that indicated he had been stabbed
613960	614960	with a syringe.
614960	620080	You know, the more I go through this, the less I actually want to even consider going
620080	621560	to a concert anymore.
621560	625480	Like I was 100% not interested, now I'm 1000% not interested.
625480	630620	And of course, as it should be in my opinion, Travis Scott is being sued over the predictable
630620	632760	and preventable Astro World tragedy.
632760	636600	He's being sued by a concert goer who was injured during the tragedy on Friday night,
636600	639280	which left 8 people dead and hundreds more injured.
639280	644560	Emanuel Soza filed a lawsuit against Scott himself, as well as the organizer Scormore
644560	648560	and the concert behemoth Live Nation, claiming the deadly disaster was predictable and preventable,
648560	652200	a motivation for profit at the expense of concert goer's health and safety, and the
652200	654200	encouragement of violence.
654200	658320	Defendants failed to properly plan and conduct the concert in a safe manner, says the attorney.
658320	662680	Instead, they consciously ignored the extreme risks of harm to concert goers, and in some
662680	666080	cases actively encouraged and fermented dangerous behaviors.
666080	670680	A second suit was filed by 23-year-old Kristin Paredes on Sunday.
670680	675200	This suit names Travis Scott and Drake as defendants and they're accused of negligence.
675200	679740	It alleges that Drake came on stage alongside Travis Scott and helped incite the crowd.
679740	684840	The crowd became chaotic and a stampede began leaving 8 dead and dozens severely injured.
684840	688520	There's no way this isn't going to continue, because this is a shit show.
688520	693160	But now we gotta ask ourselves, at what point can we actually hold someone accountable who
693160	699200	holds the attention of an entire mob of people and then directs them to be violent or destructive
699200	700200	in this way?
700200	701760	Everyone can think back to January 8th, right?
701760	714640	You can definitely find instances where President Trump used some pretty inflammatory language.
714640	719000	But you can also find instances where he did not, where he very explicitly said this was
719000	729920	meant to be a protest.
729920	732520	Forget about the potential for fake news or anything else.
732520	738300	In that specific instance, with Trump on stage at the head of a crowd, how much responsibility
738300	740800	does he have for the Capitol riot?
740800	741800	It's hard to say.
741800	743100	You can make an argument both ways.
743100	747700	But it does seem like Travis Scott probably has a lot more responsibility, because unlike
747700	750900	with Trump, Scott's rhetoric seems to have been more direct.
750900	755380	His whole thing is about hyping up crowds to the point of dangerousness.
755380	759700	And I highly doubt he said something like peacefully and amicably turn the mosh pit
759700	760700	into a murder pit.
760700	765060	And then of course you have to ask the question, how responsible should anybody be for somebody
765060	766060	else's actions?
766060	771760	Like if I were to do something supremely stupid and tell you to go kill somebody right now,
771760	776380	and then you did it, it seems like I should be held responsible for that on some level,
776380	779260	because maybe you're a superfan and you wanted to do something, like I don't know.
779260	781060	You can spin this a whole bunch of ways.
781060	785660	But the point is, is that you didn't have to listen to me.
785660	787060	Nobody had to listen to Trump.
787060	788660	Nobody had to listen to Travis Scott.
788660	793580	The point of individual responsibility is that you're responsible for your actions,
793580	795300	and they're responsible for theirs.
795300	799580	But an opposing point of view, one that I think at least warrants some kind of consideration,
799580	804700	is that if you wanted to prosecute a cult leader who talked a bunch of people into doing
804700	809500	terrible things, while not actually getting his hands dirty himself, surely there's some
809500	811780	way in which he's responsible, right?
811780	813340	Of course that's the point of incitement, isn't it?
813340	818140	But I think this is also why there's a lot of ambiguity around individual cases of incitement,
818140	822100	and why the line between incitement and legitimate free speech is often blurred.
822100	826020	I guess the only thing you can really do is keep an eye on yourself.
826020	828060	Make sure you think critically about things.
828060	832300	Don't let your brain go into autopilot mode, go into NPC mode, especially when you're in
832300	835620	a crowd of people where you might need to figure things out.
835620	841420	And also, don't go to shitty, poorly run concerts to listen to horrible auto-tuned musicians.
841420	842420	That's probably a good lesson, too.
842420	861380	Who is it that breaks your fall, puts out the flames, and saves your children?
861380	861940	They love me.
