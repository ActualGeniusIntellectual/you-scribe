WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.440
Alright my friends, this one's going to be a quickie.

00:07.440 --> 00:11.680
I do have some other larger, meatier videos coming out, but they're requiring a lot of

00:11.680 --> 00:15.240
reading and a lot of research, so I figure just to tide us over I'll do something stupid

00:15.240 --> 00:18.480
like this, since this is what currently passes for news right now.

00:18.480 --> 00:23.920
Crowdsurge kills 8 at Travis Scott's AstroWorld Festival concert in Houston.

00:23.920 --> 00:27.440
Gonna be honest, never heard of AstroWorld, never heard of Travis Scott.

00:27.440 --> 00:34.680
Okay, he's a rapper, and I don't give a shit about rap whatsoever.

00:34.680 --> 00:38.160
Wait, partner Kylie Jenner?

00:38.160 --> 00:47.440
I get that confused with Caitlyn Jenner.

00:47.440 --> 00:50.080
But okay, musician, got it.

00:50.080 --> 00:54.600
Crowdsurge kills 8 at Travis Scott's AstroWorld Festival concert in Houston.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.600
Holy shit.

00:55.600 --> 00:59.120
People attending a Houston music festival surged towards the stage during a performance

00:59.120 --> 01:02.560
by rapper Travis Scott, triggering panic in the crowd of tens of thousands.

01:02.560 --> 01:05.400
At least 8 people were killed and many more hurt.

01:05.400 --> 01:09.880
The ages of victims identified by authorities so far range from 14 to 27.

01:09.880 --> 01:11.320
One person's age was unknown.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.520
A 10 year old is in critical condition.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.240
Jesus Christ.

01:15.240 --> 01:19.720
Gotta be honest, I've never gone to a concert, never really felt the urge to go to one.

01:19.720 --> 01:22.560
Never really understood the concert culture or concert mentality.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.520
To me, music, while it can be very good, is something that you listen to while you're

01:25.520 --> 01:26.520
doing other things.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.680
I don't really view music as a primary activity personally.

01:29.680 --> 01:33.020
Maybe that's because I like shows and movies and video games too much, you know?

01:33.020 --> 01:37.240
By the way, this video is probably going to be marked not safe for work and also demonetized

01:37.240 --> 01:38.680
due to the content within it.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.600
So please consider supporting the channel guys.

01:40.600 --> 01:44.180
But yeah, we've got lots of footage from the show.

01:44.180 --> 01:47.320
Footage of fans trying to stop the show as people were dying in the crowd.

01:47.320 --> 01:50.720
I mean, I know you can't just walk onto a stage or walk onto one of the other viewing

01:50.720 --> 02:12.920
platforms but shit man, people were dying.

02:12.920 --> 02:18.160
There's footage of people bailing the fuck out, running in a giant herd, with police

02:18.160 --> 02:33.640
and security.

02:33.640 --> 02:36.440
Holy fuck dude, no one's sticking around for this.

02:36.440 --> 02:44.040
I don't blame them.

02:44.040 --> 02:55.200
For some reason security starts fucking with people, like what the hell man?

02:55.200 --> 02:59.360
This security guy, he's been good the whole time, he just starts stopping people, what

02:59.360 --> 03:02.120
the fuck?

03:02.120 --> 03:15.240
Looks like the horses are kind of spooked at you, they don't know what the fuck to do.

03:15.240 --> 03:17.520
Oh shit, they took the barricades down.

03:17.520 --> 03:24.420
Oh man, imagine the last thing that you hear is this guy's shitty rap as he does the robot

03:24.420 --> 03:27.440
while your cooling corpse is getting worked on.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.440
Jesus.

03:28.520 --> 03:32.160
God, I know I shouldn't be laughing but there's just some gallows humor to this.

03:32.160 --> 03:37.200
You got multiple dudes getting CPR done to them, to the beat of the song.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.280
Here's a comment from somebody who was there.

03:39.280 --> 03:41.240
Everyone crowd surfing was trying to breathe.

03:41.240 --> 03:45.820
I was eight people away from a VIP barricade telling them my girlfriend was suffocating

03:45.820 --> 03:47.320
and was going to die.

03:47.320 --> 03:50.320
Some people just rolled their eyes at me while VIP recorded.

03:50.320 --> 03:53.800
Scariest shit ever when you realize Travis is still performing and nobody gives a fuck

03:53.800 --> 03:54.800
about you.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.920
Me and my GF really thought that's how we were going to go out.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.760
I'm so surprised only eight people died, it felt like it would have been hundreds.

03:59.760 --> 04:02.600
I'm so thankful to the few who listened to me and helped pull my girlfriend out.

04:02.600 --> 04:06.240
We were trying to get out for four songs, nobody deserves to suffocate in a crowd like

04:06.240 --> 04:07.240
that.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.520
All I could think of in the end were the people still stuck in that crowd, suffering while

04:09.520 --> 04:11.720
I watched Travis perform back to back to back.

04:11.720 --> 04:15.880
Now every time I listen to a Travis song, all I hear is animalistic screams from the

04:15.880 --> 04:17.360
people getting crushed.

04:17.360 --> 04:18.360
Jesus.

04:18.360 --> 04:23.920
If you ever wondered why I'm not interested in going to a concert, I guess here it is.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.920
It might sound counterintuitive, but you could actually die standing up in a crowd

04:27.920 --> 04:30.380
assuming that the people are tightly packed enough.

04:30.380 --> 04:34.340
It can get to a point where you can no longer control where you're moving because the forces

04:34.340 --> 04:36.320
of all the other people around you, they're pushing you around.

04:36.320 --> 04:39.920
It can get to the point where your chest is compressed enough that you can't really breathe

04:39.920 --> 04:40.920
anymore.

04:40.920 --> 04:44.240
And if you fall over, you're likely to be either trampled by others or cause a domino

04:44.240 --> 04:48.320
effect where everybody else falls on top of you and you die underneath a pile of people.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.580
Crowds are pretty dangerous guys.

04:50.580 --> 04:53.900
So this wasn't unique to this Travis caught performance.

04:53.900 --> 04:56.580
Apparently he's done some weird stuff on stage multiple times.

04:56.580 --> 05:00.220
For example, he likes to treat the staff at his own concerts like shit.

05:00.220 --> 05:05.220
Hey, hey, hey, get your fucking nerdy ass off the stage, bro.

05:05.220 --> 05:06.220
Go.

05:06.220 --> 05:07.220
Now.

05:07.220 --> 05:08.220
You.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.220
Off.

05:09.220 --> 05:10.220
Yes.

05:10.220 --> 05:11.220
I don't know you, bro.

05:11.220 --> 05:12.220
Go, go, go.

05:12.220 --> 05:13.220
Nobody on stage, bro.

05:13.220 --> 05:14.220
Nobody on stage, bro.

05:14.220 --> 05:15.220
No disrespect.

05:15.220 --> 05:16.220
I'm an artist.

05:16.220 --> 05:17.220
I don't know.

05:17.220 --> 05:18.220
I don't know.

05:18.220 --> 05:19.220
I don't care if you're working for Summer Jam.

05:19.220 --> 05:20.220
Bye.

05:20.860 --> 05:21.860
That's another video isn't at play, right?

05:21.860 --> 05:22.860
It's another video.

05:22.860 --> 05:26.980
It's unfortunately been taken down because Twitter decided to ban the account that posted

05:26.980 --> 05:31.980
it, presumably for posting this because the content of the video was reasonably disturbing.

05:31.980 --> 05:36.900
But this video showed Travis Scott jumping into a mosh pit, being crowd surfed, all the

05:36.900 --> 05:39.940
while telling the crowd to attack other people.

05:39.940 --> 05:43.940
And he would point out while he's crowd surfing around, he would point with his hands at other

05:43.940 --> 05:44.940
people and say, get that guy.

05:44.940 --> 05:45.940
Wait, wait, wait.

05:45.940 --> 05:49.300
While I was editing this video, I actually managed to find what I was talking about.

05:49.380 --> 05:54.140
And it turns out the reason he was asking the crowd to attack people is because the

05:54.140 --> 05:56.140
guy stole his shoes.

05:56.140 --> 05:58.140
Come here, bitch.

06:03.140 --> 06:04.140
Get that motherfucker.

06:04.140 --> 06:05.140
Get him.

06:08.140 --> 06:10.140
You tried to take my shoes?

06:10.140 --> 06:12.140
You want to be a thief?

06:12.140 --> 06:13.140
Fuck him up.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.140
Fuck him up.

06:14.140 --> 06:15.140
Fuck him up.

06:16.140 --> 06:17.140
Also, apparently he's homophobic.

06:17.980 --> 06:21.980
I ain't cool with none of you faggots who just sitting here looking like a bunch of queers.

06:25.980 --> 06:27.980
You wearing a fucking La Flame shirt, motherfucker.

06:27.980 --> 06:28.980
Then you better act like it, bitch.

06:28.980 --> 06:30.980
I'm gonna rip it off your fucking back.

06:33.980 --> 06:34.980
Based.

06:34.980 --> 06:37.980
No, but really, though, it does seem like Travis Scott is kind of a piece of shit.

06:37.980 --> 06:41.980
And the only reason that he decided to put out a statement is because this went viral.

06:41.980 --> 06:44.980
I'm absolutely devastated by what took place last night.

06:45.820 --> 06:48.820
My prayers go out to the families and all those impacted by what happened at Astro World

06:48.820 --> 06:49.820
Festival.

06:49.820 --> 06:52.540
Houston Police Department has my total support as they continue to look into the tragic loss

06:52.540 --> 06:53.540
of life.

06:53.540 --> 06:55.820
I'm committed to working together with the Houston community to heal and support the

06:55.820 --> 06:56.820
families in need.

06:56.820 --> 06:57.820
No, you're not.

06:57.820 --> 06:58.820
You're already on a plane out of there, dude.

06:58.820 --> 07:02.140
Thank you to Houston PD, Fire Department, and NRG Park for their immediate response

07:02.140 --> 07:03.140
and support.

07:03.140 --> 07:04.140
Love you all.

07:04.140 --> 07:05.140
Holy fuck, dude.

07:05.140 --> 07:09.260
The thing is, from what I understand, Travis Scott seems to have a history of doing this

07:09.260 --> 07:14.100
sort of thing, of hyping up the crowd to the point that they actually begin to engage in

07:14.100 --> 07:17.780
crowd crushes, where the entire crowd moves forward.

07:17.780 --> 07:21.660
And so the people in the center of the crowd have no choice but to keep moving forward

07:21.660 --> 07:24.460
because they're being pushed by momentum, which then pushes the people in front of them,

07:24.460 --> 07:26.060
which then crushes the crowd.

07:26.060 --> 07:27.060
He's encouraged violence.

07:27.060 --> 07:30.540
He already has a charge on his record for inciting a riot.

07:30.540 --> 07:35.120
He's even been deleting tweets on his official account, where he talks about bringing in

07:35.120 --> 07:39.180
ragers and stuff, you know, people who will actually hype a crowd up to that dangerous

07:39.180 --> 07:40.180
level.

07:40.180 --> 07:43.480
And it's not like the music industry doesn't have examples of people who, when they were

07:43.520 --> 07:48.080
giving performances and they saw something happening in the crowd, did the right thing

07:48.080 --> 07:49.080
and stopped the show.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.080
You've got musicians who have stopped fights.

08:13.480 --> 08:22.480
Who have stopped people from being sexually assaulted in the crowd.

08:43.480 --> 08:52.480
Who have stopped the show to help people who've fallen over in the crowd.

09:13.480 --> 09:24.480
Who have used the stage to make sure that people who are having some kind of medical

09:24.480 --> 09:43.160
emergency during the show get access to some kind of help.

09:43.160 --> 09:48.760
This is not just an on-with-the-show mentality, because the pros who understand what position

09:48.760 --> 09:51.400
they're in and actually care about their fans, they do this sort of stuff.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.520
And of course there's just some weirdness coming out of this.

09:53.520 --> 09:58.160
Astro World Security pricked a neck with needle, says the Houston police.

09:58.160 --> 10:02.880
What the f- At least one person had been injected with something via needle.

10:02.880 --> 10:06.840
A security guard was working the event, and he felt a prick in his neck by an unknown

10:06.840 --> 10:10.120
assailant while he was trying to restrain a citizen, and he quickly fell unconscious.

10:10.120 --> 10:13.960
No personnel did indeed see something on his neck that indicated he had been stabbed

10:13.960 --> 10:14.960
with a syringe.

10:14.960 --> 10:20.080
You know, the more I go through this, the less I actually want to even consider going

10:20.080 --> 10:21.560
to a concert anymore.

10:21.560 --> 10:25.480
Like I was 100% not interested, now I'm 1000% not interested.

10:25.480 --> 10:30.620
And of course, as it should be in my opinion, Travis Scott is being sued over the predictable

10:30.620 --> 10:32.760
and preventable Astro World tragedy.

10:32.760 --> 10:36.600
He's being sued by a concert goer who was injured during the tragedy on Friday night,

10:36.600 --> 10:39.280
which left 8 people dead and hundreds more injured.

10:39.280 --> 10:44.560
Emanuel Soza filed a lawsuit against Scott himself, as well as the organizer Scormore

10:44.560 --> 10:48.560
and the concert behemoth Live Nation, claiming the deadly disaster was predictable and preventable,

10:48.560 --> 10:52.200
a motivation for profit at the expense of concert goer's health and safety, and the

10:52.200 --> 10:54.200
encouragement of violence.

10:54.200 --> 10:58.320
Defendants failed to properly plan and conduct the concert in a safe manner, says the attorney.

10:58.320 --> 11:02.680
Instead, they consciously ignored the extreme risks of harm to concert goers, and in some

11:02.680 --> 11:06.080
cases actively encouraged and fermented dangerous behaviors.

11:06.080 --> 11:10.680
A second suit was filed by 23-year-old Kristin Paredes on Sunday.

11:10.680 --> 11:15.200
This suit names Travis Scott and Drake as defendants and they're accused of negligence.

11:15.200 --> 11:19.740
It alleges that Drake came on stage alongside Travis Scott and helped incite the crowd.

11:19.740 --> 11:24.840
The crowd became chaotic and a stampede began leaving 8 dead and dozens severely injured.

11:24.840 --> 11:28.520
There's no way this isn't going to continue, because this is a shit show.

11:28.520 --> 11:33.160
But now we gotta ask ourselves, at what point can we actually hold someone accountable who

11:33.160 --> 11:39.200
holds the attention of an entire mob of people and then directs them to be violent or destructive

11:39.200 --> 11:40.200
in this way?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.760
Everyone can think back to January 8th, right?

11:41.760 --> 11:54.640
You can definitely find instances where President Trump used some pretty inflammatory language.

11:54.640 --> 11:59.000
But you can also find instances where he did not, where he very explicitly said this was

11:59.000 --> 12:09.920
meant to be a protest.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.520
Forget about the potential for fake news or anything else.

12:12.520 --> 12:18.300
In that specific instance, with Trump on stage at the head of a crowd, how much responsibility

12:18.300 --> 12:20.800
does he have for the Capitol riot?

12:20.800 --> 12:21.800
It's hard to say.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.100
You can make an argument both ways.

12:23.100 --> 12:27.700
But it does seem like Travis Scott probably has a lot more responsibility, because unlike

12:27.700 --> 12:30.900
with Trump, Scott's rhetoric seems to have been more direct.

12:30.900 --> 12:35.380
His whole thing is about hyping up crowds to the point of dangerousness.

12:35.380 --> 12:39.700
And I highly doubt he said something like peacefully and amicably turn the mosh pit

12:39.700 --> 12:40.700
into a murder pit.

12:40.700 --> 12:45.060
And then of course you have to ask the question, how responsible should anybody be for somebody

12:45.060 --> 12:46.060
else's actions?

12:46.060 --> 12:51.760
Like if I were to do something supremely stupid and tell you to go kill somebody right now,

12:51.760 --> 12:56.380
and then you did it, it seems like I should be held responsible for that on some level,

12:56.380 --> 12:59.260
because maybe you're a superfan and you wanted to do something, like I don't know.

12:59.260 --> 13:01.060
You can spin this a whole bunch of ways.

13:01.060 --> 13:05.660
But the point is, is that you didn't have to listen to me.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.060
Nobody had to listen to Trump.

13:07.060 --> 13:08.660
Nobody had to listen to Travis Scott.

13:08.660 --> 13:13.580
The point of individual responsibility is that you're responsible for your actions,

13:13.580 --> 13:15.300
and they're responsible for theirs.

13:15.300 --> 13:19.580
But an opposing point of view, one that I think at least warrants some kind of consideration,

13:19.580 --> 13:24.700
is that if you wanted to prosecute a cult leader who talked a bunch of people into doing

13:24.700 --> 13:29.500
terrible things, while not actually getting his hands dirty himself, surely there's some

13:29.500 --> 13:31.780
way in which he's responsible, right?

13:31.780 --> 13:33.340
Of course that's the point of incitement, isn't it?

13:33.340 --> 13:38.140
But I think this is also why there's a lot of ambiguity around individual cases of incitement,

13:38.140 --> 13:42.100
and why the line between incitement and legitimate free speech is often blurred.

13:42.100 --> 13:46.020
I guess the only thing you can really do is keep an eye on yourself.

13:46.020 --> 13:48.060
Make sure you think critically about things.

13:48.060 --> 13:52.300
Don't let your brain go into autopilot mode, go into NPC mode, especially when you're in

13:52.300 --> 13:55.620
a crowd of people where you might need to figure things out.

13:55.620 --> 14:01.420
And also, don't go to shitty, poorly run concerts to listen to horrible auto-tuned musicians.

14:01.420 --> 14:02.420
That's probably a good lesson, too.

14:02.420 --> 14:21.380
Who is it that breaks your fall, puts out the flames, and saves your children?

14:21.380 --> 14:21.940
They love me.
