1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
Alright my friends, this one's going to be a quickie.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,680
I do have some other larger, meatier videos coming out, but they're requiring a lot of

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,240
reading and a lot of research, so I figure just to tide us over I'll do something stupid

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,480
like this, since this is what currently passes for news right now.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,920
Crowdsurge kills 8 at Travis Scott's AstroWorld Festival concert in Houston.

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,440
Gonna be honest, never heard of AstroWorld, never heard of Travis Scott.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:34,680
Okay, he's a rapper, and I don't give a shit about rap whatsoever.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,160
Wait, partner Kylie Jenner?

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:47,440
I get that confused with Caitlyn Jenner.

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,080
But okay, musician, got it.

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,600
Crowdsurge kills 8 at Travis Scott's AstroWorld Festival concert in Houston.

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
Holy shit.

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,120
People attending a Houston music festival surged towards the stage during a performance

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,560
by rapper Travis Scott, triggering panic in the crowd of tens of thousands.

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,400
At least 8 people were killed and many more hurt.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,880
The ages of victims identified by authorities so far range from 14 to 27.

17
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,320
One person's age was unknown.

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,520
A 10 year old is in critical condition.

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,240
Jesus Christ.

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,720
Gotta be honest, I've never gone to a concert, never really felt the urge to go to one.

21
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,560
Never really understood the concert culture or concert mentality.

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,520
To me, music, while it can be very good, is something that you listen to while you're

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,520
doing other things.

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,680
I don't really view music as a primary activity personally.

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,020
Maybe that's because I like shows and movies and video games too much, you know?

26
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,240
By the way, this video is probably going to be marked not safe for work and also demonetized

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,680
due to the content within it.

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,600
So please consider supporting the channel guys.

29
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,180
But yeah, we've got lots of footage from the show.

30
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,320
Footage of fans trying to stop the show as people were dying in the crowd.

31
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,720
I mean, I know you can't just walk onto a stage or walk onto one of the other viewing

32
00:01:50,720 --> 00:02:12,920
platforms but shit man, people were dying.

33
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,160
There's footage of people bailing the fuck out, running in a giant herd, with police

34
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:33,640
and security.

35
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,440
Holy fuck dude, no one's sticking around for this.

36
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:44,040
I don't blame them.

37
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:55,200
For some reason security starts fucking with people, like what the hell man?

38
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,360
This security guy, he's been good the whole time, he just starts stopping people, what

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,120
the fuck?

40
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:15,240
Looks like the horses are kind of spooked at you, they don't know what the fuck to do.

41
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,520
Oh shit, they took the barricades down.

42
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:24,420
Oh man, imagine the last thing that you hear is this guy's shitty rap as he does the robot

43
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,440
while your cooling corpse is getting worked on.

44
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,440
Jesus.

45
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,160
God, I know I shouldn't be laughing but there's just some gallows humor to this.

46
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,200
You got multiple dudes getting CPR done to them, to the beat of the song.

47
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,280
Here's a comment from somebody who was there.

48
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,240
Everyone crowd surfing was trying to breathe.

49
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,820
I was eight people away from a VIP barricade telling them my girlfriend was suffocating

50
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,320
and was going to die.

51
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,320
Some people just rolled their eyes at me while VIP recorded.

52
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,800
Scariest shit ever when you realize Travis is still performing and nobody gives a fuck

53
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
about you.

54
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,920
Me and my GF really thought that's how we were going to go out.

55
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,760
I'm so surprised only eight people died, it felt like it would have been hundreds.

56
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,600
I'm so thankful to the few who listened to me and helped pull my girlfriend out.

57
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,240
We were trying to get out for four songs, nobody deserves to suffocate in a crowd like

58
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,240
that.

59
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,520
All I could think of in the end were the people still stuck in that crowd, suffering while

60
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,720
I watched Travis perform back to back to back.

61
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,880
Now every time I listen to a Travis song, all I hear is animalistic screams from the

62
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,360
people getting crushed.

63
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
Jesus.

64
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,920
If you ever wondered why I'm not interested in going to a concert, I guess here it is.

65
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,920
It might sound counterintuitive, but you could actually die standing up in a crowd

66
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,380
assuming that the people are tightly packed enough.

67
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,340
It can get to a point where you can no longer control where you're moving because the forces

68
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,320
of all the other people around you, they're pushing you around.

69
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,920
It can get to the point where your chest is compressed enough that you can't really breathe

70
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
anymore.

71
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,240
And if you fall over, you're likely to be either trampled by others or cause a domino

72
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,320
effect where everybody else falls on top of you and you die underneath a pile of people.

73
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,580
Crowds are pretty dangerous guys.

74
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,900
So this wasn't unique to this Travis caught performance.

75
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,580
Apparently he's done some weird stuff on stage multiple times.

76
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,220
For example, he likes to treat the staff at his own concerts like shit.

77
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,220
Hey, hey, hey, get your fucking nerdy ass off the stage, bro.

78
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,220
Go.

79
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,220
Now.

80
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,220
You.

81
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,220
Off.

82
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,220
Yes.

83
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,220
I don't know you, bro.

84
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,220
Go, go, go.

85
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,220
Nobody on stage, bro.

86
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,220
Nobody on stage, bro.

87
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,220
No disrespect.

88
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,220
I'm an artist.

89
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,220
I don't know.

90
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,220
I don't know.

91
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,220
I don't care if you're working for Summer Jam.

92
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,220
Bye.

93
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,860
That's another video isn't at play, right?

94
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,860
It's another video.

95
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,980
It's unfortunately been taken down because Twitter decided to ban the account that posted

96
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,980
it, presumably for posting this because the content of the video was reasonably disturbing.

97
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,900
But this video showed Travis Scott jumping into a mosh pit, being crowd surfed, all the

98
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,940
while telling the crowd to attack other people.

99
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,940
And he would point out while he's crowd surfing around, he would point with his hands at other

100
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,940
people and say, get that guy.

101
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,940
Wait, wait, wait.

102
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,300
While I was editing this video, I actually managed to find what I was talking about.

103
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,140
And it turns out the reason he was asking the crowd to attack people is because the

104
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,140
guy stole his shoes.

105
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,140
Come here, bitch.

106
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,140
Get that motherfucker.

107
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,140
Get him.

108
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,140
You tried to take my shoes?

109
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,140
You want to be a thief?

110
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,140
Fuck him up.

111
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,140
Fuck him up.

112
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,140
Fuck him up.

113
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,140
Also, apparently he's homophobic.

114
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,980
I ain't cool with none of you faggots who just sitting here looking like a bunch of queers.

115
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,980
You wearing a fucking La Flame shirt, motherfucker.

116
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,980
Then you better act like it, bitch.

117
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,980
I'm gonna rip it off your fucking back.

118
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,980
Based.

119
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,980
No, but really, though, it does seem like Travis Scott is kind of a piece of shit.

120
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,980
And the only reason that he decided to put out a statement is because this went viral.

121
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,980
I'm absolutely devastated by what took place last night.

122
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,820
My prayers go out to the families and all those impacted by what happened at Astro World

123
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,820
Festival.

124
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,540
Houston Police Department has my total support as they continue to look into the tragic loss

125
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,540
of life.

126
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,820
I'm committed to working together with the Houston community to heal and support the

127
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,820
families in need.

128
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,820
No, you're not.

129
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,820
You're already on a plane out of there, dude.

130
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,140
Thank you to Houston PD, Fire Department, and NRG Park for their immediate response

131
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,140
and support.

132
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,140
Love you all.

133
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,140
Holy fuck, dude.

134
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,260
The thing is, from what I understand, Travis Scott seems to have a history of doing this

135
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:14,100
sort of thing, of hyping up the crowd to the point that they actually begin to engage in

136
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,780
crowd crushes, where the entire crowd moves forward.

137
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,660
And so the people in the center of the crowd have no choice but to keep moving forward

138
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,460
because they're being pushed by momentum, which then pushes the people in front of them,

139
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,060
which then crushes the crowd.

140
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,060
He's encouraged violence.

141
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,540
He already has a charge on his record for inciting a riot.

142
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,120
He's even been deleting tweets on his official account, where he talks about bringing in

143
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,180
ragers and stuff, you know, people who will actually hype a crowd up to that dangerous

144
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,180
level.

145
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,480
And it's not like the music industry doesn't have examples of people who, when they were

146
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,080
giving performances and they saw something happening in the crowd, did the right thing

147
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
and stopped the show.

148
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,080
You've got musicians who have stopped fights.

149
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Who have stopped people from being sexually assaulted in the crowd.

150
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:52,480
Who have stopped the show to help people who've fallen over in the crowd.

151
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:24,480
Who have used the stage to make sure that people who are having some kind of medical

152
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:43,160
emergency during the show get access to some kind of help.

153
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,760
This is not just an on-with-the-show mentality, because the pros who understand what position

154
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,400
they're in and actually care about their fans, they do this sort of stuff.

155
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,520
And of course there's just some weirdness coming out of this.

156
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,160
Astro World Security pricked a neck with needle, says the Houston police.

157
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,880
What the f- At least one person had been injected with something via needle.

158
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,840
A security guard was working the event, and he felt a prick in his neck by an unknown

159
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,120
assailant while he was trying to restrain a citizen, and he quickly fell unconscious.

160
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,960
No personnel did indeed see something on his neck that indicated he had been stabbed

161
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
with a syringe.

162
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:20,080
You know, the more I go through this, the less I actually want to even consider going

163
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,560
to a concert anymore.

164
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,480
Like I was 100% not interested, now I'm 1000% not interested.

165
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,620
And of course, as it should be in my opinion, Travis Scott is being sued over the predictable

166
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,760
and preventable Astro World tragedy.

167
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,600
He's being sued by a concert goer who was injured during the tragedy on Friday night,

168
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,280
which left 8 people dead and hundreds more injured.

169
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,560
Emanuel Soza filed a lawsuit against Scott himself, as well as the organizer Scormore

170
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,560
and the concert behemoth Live Nation, claiming the deadly disaster was predictable and preventable,

171
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,200
a motivation for profit at the expense of concert goer's health and safety, and the

172
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
encouragement of violence.

173
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,320
Defendants failed to properly plan and conduct the concert in a safe manner, says the attorney.

174
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,680
Instead, they consciously ignored the extreme risks of harm to concert goers, and in some

175
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,080
cases actively encouraged and fermented dangerous behaviors.

176
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,680
A second suit was filed by 23-year-old Kristin Paredes on Sunday.

177
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,200
This suit names Travis Scott and Drake as defendants and they're accused of negligence.

178
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,740
It alleges that Drake came on stage alongside Travis Scott and helped incite the crowd.

179
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,840
The crowd became chaotic and a stampede began leaving 8 dead and dozens severely injured.

180
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,520
There's no way this isn't going to continue, because this is a shit show.

181
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,160
But now we gotta ask ourselves, at what point can we actually hold someone accountable who

182
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:39,200
holds the attention of an entire mob of people and then directs them to be violent or destructive

183
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
in this way?

184
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,760
Everyone can think back to January 8th, right?

185
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:54,640
You can definitely find instances where President Trump used some pretty inflammatory language.

186
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,000
But you can also find instances where he did not, where he very explicitly said this was

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:09,920
meant to be a protest.

188
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,520
Forget about the potential for fake news or anything else.

189
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:18,300
In that specific instance, with Trump on stage at the head of a crowd, how much responsibility

190
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,800
does he have for the Capitol riot?

191
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
It's hard to say.

192
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,100
You can make an argument both ways.

193
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,700
But it does seem like Travis Scott probably has a lot more responsibility, because unlike

194
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,900
with Trump, Scott's rhetoric seems to have been more direct.

195
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,380
His whole thing is about hyping up crowds to the point of dangerousness.

196
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,700
And I highly doubt he said something like peacefully and amicably turn the mosh pit

197
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,700
into a murder pit.

198
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,060
And then of course you have to ask the question, how responsible should anybody be for somebody

199
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,060
else's actions?

200
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:51,760
Like if I were to do something supremely stupid and tell you to go kill somebody right now,

201
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,380
and then you did it, it seems like I should be held responsible for that on some level,

202
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,260
because maybe you're a superfan and you wanted to do something, like I don't know.

203
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,060
You can spin this a whole bunch of ways.

204
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,660
But the point is, is that you didn't have to listen to me.

205
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,060
Nobody had to listen to Trump.

206
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,660
Nobody had to listen to Travis Scott.

207
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,580
The point of individual responsibility is that you're responsible for your actions,

208
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,300
and they're responsible for theirs.

209
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,580
But an opposing point of view, one that I think at least warrants some kind of consideration,

210
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:24,700
is that if you wanted to prosecute a cult leader who talked a bunch of people into doing

211
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,500
terrible things, while not actually getting his hands dirty himself, surely there's some

212
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,780
way in which he's responsible, right?

213
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,340
Of course that's the point of incitement, isn't it?

214
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:38,140
But I think this is also why there's a lot of ambiguity around individual cases of incitement,

215
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,100
and why the line between incitement and legitimate free speech is often blurred.

216
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,020
I guess the only thing you can really do is keep an eye on yourself.

217
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,060
Make sure you think critically about things.

218
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,300
Don't let your brain go into autopilot mode, go into NPC mode, especially when you're in

219
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,620
a crowd of people where you might need to figure things out.

220
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:01,420
And also, don't go to shitty, poorly run concerts to listen to horrible auto-tuned musicians.

221
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,420
That's probably a good lesson, too.

222
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:21,380
Who is it that breaks your fall, puts out the flames, and saves your children?

223
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:21,940
They love me.
