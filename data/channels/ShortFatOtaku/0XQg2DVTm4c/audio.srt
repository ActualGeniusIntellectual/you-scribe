1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280
In my Scott Cawthon video, I outlined the following principle, and since we're going

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,840
to be using it again today, it's probably a good idea to dig into it a bit more deeply.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,160
I mentioned that if you had an immutable characteristic that you publicly identified with, you could

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,720
experience bigotry for it.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,980
For example, if you outwardly identified as a gay man, and you had the immutable characteristic

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,260
of being gay, you might face homophobia from some people.

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:31,100
To anybody who is liberal-minded, to anybody who values fairness as a principle, this isn't

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,100
right.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,140
It makes no sense to hold somebody back in life for something that they cannot help and

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,140
cannot change.

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,580
That seems simple enough, right?

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,260
That was the backbone of gay marriage activism, back when that was still a relevant social

13
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,260
issue.

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,660
You know, being born that way.

15
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:49,140
I still believe this to be fundamentally true, but when you poison this equation with intersectionality,

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,460
when you replace the fairness of liberalism with the equity of progressivism, we can watch

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,420
in real time this formulation crumble away.

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,980
The liberal conception of bigotry requires both components to be real homophobia, the

19
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,260
identity and the immutable characteristic.

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,800
That should seem obvious.

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,660
For example, if you're a closeted gay man, and let's say that you're closeted enough

22
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,300
that others can't really tell that you're gay, if you have the immutable characteristic

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,580
of being gay, but not that public persona, you're not actually going to experience homophobia,

24
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,500
at least not directed at you.

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,600
There are, of course, also instances where you cannot actually conceal the identity.

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,540
For example, you can't be a closeted black man, you're always going to have that outward

27
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,220
signifier due to your skin color.

28
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,500
The legitimate racism that black people face comes from the public identification of their

29
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,780
blackness, plus the immutable characteristic that is their ethnicity.

30
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,020
What progressives began to notice, however, is that people who had the identity, but not

31
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,900
the immutable characteristic, could also experience something that, on the surface, seemed like

32
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,900
bigotry.

33
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,140
Let's assume a man who isn't actually gay at all.

34
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,900
He lacks the immutable characteristic of being gay, but he outwardly presents as very

35
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:58,020
feminine and camp, and you know, stereotypically gay, even though he's not.

36
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,220
If that individual were to be placed in a social situation where a gay person might

37
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,020
experience homophobia, he too would be given shit for his outward behaviors by those same

38
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,020
people.

39
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,940
However, where the progressives went wrong, was in assuming that this negativity was actually

40
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,100
homophobia, of the exact same stripe that a legitimately gay man would face, however,

41
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,100
it's not.

42
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,860
After all, he's not actually gay.

43
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,780
Maybe it's anti-male sentiment, maybe it's anti-femboy sentiment, though I can see why

44
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,940
the progs, for political reasons, would not want to admit that those two forms of bigotry

45
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,280
actually exist.

46
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,580
Maybe it's not bigotry at all, maybe they're just making fun of him for being a wimp.

47
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,260
Maybe he actually does need to toughen up a little bit.

48
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,300
Maybe not, who knows?

49
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,260
But the point is, within the liberal framework we're talking about here, this isn't homophobia

50
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,520
because there's no actual gay people involved.

51
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,200
By the way, this is why I think two white people who jokingly say the n-word to each

52
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,240
other aren't actually racist, because I don't believe language is a magic spell that you

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,160
cast to make the universe incrementally better or worse.

54
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,240
However, if we accept the progressive framework rather than the liberal one on this issue,

55
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,600
if we were to actually believe that the feminine guy getting flacked for being feminine is

56
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,640
somehow actually homophobia, and not simply anti-male or anti-fem or just people being

57
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,220
assholes, then it logically follows that in order to experience bigotry, you don't actually

58
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,520
need the immutable characteristic, only the identity.

59
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,560
You don't need to be gay to experience homophobia.

60
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,800
And what logically follows from that is people demanding all of their identities be respected

61
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,720
as valid, all the way down to mental illnesses or associations with fandoms and subcultures,

62
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,560
and yes, transracialism.

63
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,200
And even if there's a possibility that the person is just faking it for clout, like I

64
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,700
brought up in my Demi Lovato video, there's a big story recently about Ollie London transitioning

65
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,440
their race to become Korean.

66
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,760
This was covered by Hassan, who hilariously had no argument against it.

67
00:03:41,760 --> 00:04:04,880
It was also covered by Sargon and PewDiePie and others too.

68
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,180
But I think everybody's missing a crucial component of the conversation here.

69
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,100
That component is the difference between the liberal and progressive conceptions of

70
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,100
bigotry.

71
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,120
This logic applies to other transracial people as well, from Shaun King to Rachel Dolezal.

72
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,300
The progressives find themselves without any convincing arguments against transracialism

73
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,480
because they have already expelled the immutable characteristic from the bigotry equation.

74
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,480
If it really is all just identification, then however you identify must inherently be valid,

75
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,800
no matter what it is you're identifying as.

76
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,480
By the way, this is the core of the attack helicopter joke from years and years ago.

77
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:57,480
I'm glad progressives are finally beginning to catch on to this logic.

78
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,480
I remember at one point speaking to Lilith about her own transgenderism, and she colloquially

79
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,500
defined it as, I think I'm a girl and I can't stop.

80
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
There's two important takeaways from that.

81
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,700
One is that she's appealing to an immutable characteristic, that she cannot help but be

82
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,700
trans.

83
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,700
It doesn't matter if in some alternate timeline, she decided to not transition, and instead

84
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,080
outwardly appearing to be hyper-masculine.

85
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,660
She would always be this way inside her own head.

86
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,620
She would always be closeted.

87
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,460
And two, naturally following from one, she recognizes that she thinks she is a woman.

88
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,440
Not that she's actually biologically female and therefore sex doesn't exist and all

89
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
this other nonsense.

90
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,960
Lilith understands that she has gender dysphoria, that it is a mental disorder, and that her

91
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,820
being afflicted with it is the grounds that makes her treatment of it legitimate.

92
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,480
Part of that treatment is transitioning.

93
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,820
Part of that treatment is surrounding herself with people who accept her identity.

94
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,560
But she also understands that some people just won't do that.

95
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,420
They have the right not to, and she has the right not to associate with them.

96
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,660
This is what makes transgenderism valid within a liberal framework.

97
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,800
The understanding that it's not simply a matter of identity, but that it has an immutable,

98
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
medical component.

99
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,100
And that transitioning is not simply living your best life or being accepted for who you

100
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,880
are deep down, it's medical treatment.

101
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,620
Progressives fundamentally reject this liberal argument as transmedicalism.

102
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,780
The transmedicalist is somebody who believes that being transgender is contingent on experiencing

103
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,120
gender dysphoria, and that people who identify as transgender but don't experience gender

104
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,620
dysphoria and have no desire to transition are not truly transgender.

105
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:29,860
Progressives often deride transmedicalists as true scum, which stands for true transsexual

106
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,980
scum, referring to the practice of gatekeeping transness to people who actually experience

107
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,180
gender dysphoria.

108
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,380
The progressives also contrast true scum with too cute, standing for too cute to be cisgender.

109
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,140
Yes, I know that neither of these terms are acronyms, I never said this shit made any

110
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,140
sense.

111
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,940
The point is, there is a massive split between the trans people who genuinely cannot help

112
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,260
but be trans, and the trans people who believe that they are trans based solely on their

113
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,860
identity as such.

114
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,540
Liberal versus progressive, transmedicalist versus transtrender, immutable characteristic

115
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,540
versus identity.

116
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,240
It should be no surprise to you which side I fall on.

117
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,280
When Hassan spoke out against Olly London's transracialism on the grounds of it lacking

118
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,660
an immutable characteristic, his own chatroom rebelled against him, bringing up the spectre

119
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:37,260
of transmedicalism.

120
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:14,060
And if you're a progressive who already expelled the legitimacy of immutable characteristics

121
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,420
from your moral framework, then you have no leg to stand on when it comes to transracial

122
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,420
people.

123
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,200
Progressives have to fall back on liberal positions to object to this shit.

124
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,900
Like I said, this is an older phenomenon than just Olly London.

125
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,440
Other people have been doing this for a while now.

126
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,880
This is an article from 2019 complaining about Rachel Dolezal, titled Transracial is not

127
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,140
the New Transgender.

128
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,700
How do you think these people square their objection to it?

129
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,420
Unlike gender, which is assigned to you at birth, your race or ethnicity is rooted in

130
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,420
ancestry.

131
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,340
You can't inherit your gender, but you do inherit your race.

132
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,660
The fact that these people believe that they can pick and choose parts of their ethnicity

133
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,820
they want, and later decide to revert to their whiteness is white privilege at its worst.

134
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,860
Oh look, it's an appeal to immutable characteristics.

135
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,480
Of course, the truth is, you do actually inherit both your biological sex, and in many cases

136
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,460
your gender identity, from your parents, because we are not purely socially constructed beings.

137
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,820
Here's the real kicker though.

138
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,700
Progressives actually do believe in transracialism, but only when it benefits their politics.

139
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,540
Here's a viral Twitter thread from last year.

140
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,300
If you look white, you're white.

141
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,380
The concept of race is based on appearance.

142
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,020
So you're outward facing identity, not your immutable characteristics.

143
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,180
So yeah, you're white and you need to face that.

144
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:27,020
Yes, you can still be ethnically and culturally part of a non-white culture, but you are still

145
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,020
white.

146
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,300
Check your privilege and use it for good.

147
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,580
Maybe sometimes you're seen as white, but sometimes you're not.

148
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,300
Yet the mere fact that you can be seen as white at all is a privilege itself.

149
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,100
You can still be white and indigenous.

150
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,820
You can be white and have parents or siblings who are visibly non-white.

151
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,060
It doesn't cancel out your hardships.

152
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,700
Intersectionality will always be a thing.

153
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,060
Don't come into my mentions telling me about how your struggles as a white passing person

154
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,900
overshadow mine as a very visible Asian person.

155
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,780
I respect and encourage you to stay connected with your non-white culture, but don't act

156
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,740
like you know what it's like to be an actual person of color.

157
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,940
When the transracialism involves a white person transitioning to be another race, it's invalid,

158
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,860
it's blackface, it's whitey avoiding responsibility for their colonizing past.

159
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,620
But when the transracialism involves a non-white person looking more white than they actually

160
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,080
are, these activists are willing to completely expel people into the white race based on

161
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,080
colorism alone.

162
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,500
If you're a black person who is white passing, you ain't black, I guess.

163
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,800
It's almost as if non-white racial identities are cherished and protected as something exclusive

164
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
by these people.

165
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,600
As a side note, it will always be weird to me to watch progressives fall back on the

166
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,340
one-drop rule in order to justify their strict ethnic segregationism, despite completely

167
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,960
avoiding biology as they abolish gender segregationism.

168
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,900
The separate but equal doctrine in American law was enshrined by the Plessy vs Ferguson

169
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,080
lawsuit in 1896.

170
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,960
Homer Plessy, who was one-eighth black and therefore legally considered to be a black

171
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,620
man because American law cared about race in that way at that time, and despite appearing

172
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,880
entirely white, was forced out of the first class carriage of a train back into the colored

173
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,600
carriage despite having a first class ticket.

174
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,960
Over 100 years later, people similarly complain about pretendians like Elizabeth Warren who

175
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,400
use some distant Native American ancestry to gain advantages, despite being almost entirely

176
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
white.

177
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,480
Both are bigotry, both are unfair, both are fundamentally anti-liberal.

178
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,800
We can object to this stuff because our formulation of bigotry is still intact, it's not just

179
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,520
how you identify, it's also your immutable characteristics that determines legitimate

180
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
bigotry.

181
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,620
In removing the immutable characteristics from their arguments, progressives have no

182
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,220
reply to any of this, and if that's the case, there is no argument against stuff like

183
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,320
this too.

184
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,360
Why not simply define yourself as not white but 75% French and 25% Belgian?

185
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,220
If white people today are going to take the blame for shit they didn't do on the grounds

186
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,740
of ancestral guilt, why not just identify yourself out of whiteness?

187
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,740
Fuck it.

188
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,900
Why, from a liberal perspective, we see progressives as being racist, sexist, homophobic and so

189
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,740
on because their conception of bigotry inevitably leads to more bigotry.

190
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,500
The progressive in stripping away the immutable characteristic from the equation becomes permissive

191
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,660
of a whole bunch of terrible stuff that liberals correctly view as bigoted.

192
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,740
Their only way out is to double down on their bigotry or fall back to our position once

193
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,060
they can no longer stand lying.
