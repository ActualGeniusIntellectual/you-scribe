0	9280	In my Scott Cawthon video, I outlined the following principle, and since we're going
9280	12840	to be using it again today, it's probably a good idea to dig into it a bit more deeply.
12840	17160	I mentioned that if you had an immutable characteristic that you publicly identified with, you could
17160	18720	experience bigotry for it.
18720	22980	For example, if you outwardly identified as a gay man, and you had the immutable characteristic
22980	26260	of being gay, you might face homophobia from some people.
26260	31100	To anybody who is liberal-minded, to anybody who values fairness as a principle, this isn't
31100	32100	right.
32100	35140	It makes no sense to hold somebody back in life for something that they cannot help and
35140	36140	cannot change.
36140	37580	That seems simple enough, right?
37580	41260	That was the backbone of gay marriage activism, back when that was still a relevant social
41260	42260	issue.
42260	43660	You know, being born that way.
43660	49140	I still believe this to be fundamentally true, but when you poison this equation with intersectionality,
49140	53460	when you replace the fairness of liberalism with the equity of progressivism, we can watch
53460	56420	in real time this formulation crumble away.
56420	60980	The liberal conception of bigotry requires both components to be real homophobia, the
60980	63260	identity and the immutable characteristic.
63260	64800	That should seem obvious.
64800	68660	For example, if you're a closeted gay man, and let's say that you're closeted enough
68660	72300	that others can't really tell that you're gay, if you have the immutable characteristic
72300	77580	of being gay, but not that public persona, you're not actually going to experience homophobia,
77580	79500	at least not directed at you.
79500	83600	There are, of course, also instances where you cannot actually conceal the identity.
83600	87540	For example, you can't be a closeted black man, you're always going to have that outward
87540	89220	signifier due to your skin color.
89220	93500	The legitimate racism that black people face comes from the public identification of their
93500	96780	blackness, plus the immutable characteristic that is their ethnicity.
96780	101020	What progressives began to notice, however, is that people who had the identity, but not
101020	105900	the immutable characteristic, could also experience something that, on the surface, seemed like
105900	106900	bigotry.
106900	109140	Let's assume a man who isn't actually gay at all.
109140	112900	He lacks the immutable characteristic of being gay, but he outwardly presents as very
112900	118020	feminine and camp, and you know, stereotypically gay, even though he's not.
118020	122220	If that individual were to be placed in a social situation where a gay person might
122220	127020	experience homophobia, he too would be given shit for his outward behaviors by those same
127020	128020	people.
128020	131940	However, where the progressives went wrong, was in assuming that this negativity was actually
131940	137100	homophobia, of the exact same stripe that a legitimately gay man would face, however,
137100	138100	it's not.
138100	139860	After all, he's not actually gay.
139860	143780	Maybe it's anti-male sentiment, maybe it's anti-femboy sentiment, though I can see why
143780	147940	the progs, for political reasons, would not want to admit that those two forms of bigotry
147940	149280	actually exist.
149280	152580	Maybe it's not bigotry at all, maybe they're just making fun of him for being a wimp.
152580	154260	Maybe he actually does need to toughen up a little bit.
154260	155300	Maybe not, who knows?
155300	160260	But the point is, within the liberal framework we're talking about here, this isn't homophobia
160260	162520	because there's no actual gay people involved.
162520	166200	By the way, this is why I think two white people who jokingly say the n-word to each
166200	170240	other aren't actually racist, because I don't believe language is a magic spell that you
170240	173160	cast to make the universe incrementally better or worse.
173160	177240	However, if we accept the progressive framework rather than the liberal one on this issue,
177240	180600	if we were to actually believe that the feminine guy getting flacked for being feminine is
180600	186640	somehow actually homophobia, and not simply anti-male or anti-fem or just people being
186640	191220	assholes, then it logically follows that in order to experience bigotry, you don't actually
191220	194520	need the immutable characteristic, only the identity.
194520	197560	You don't need to be gay to experience homophobia.
197560	201800	And what logically follows from that is people demanding all of their identities be respected
201800	206720	as valid, all the way down to mental illnesses or associations with fandoms and subcultures,
206720	208560	and yes, transracialism.
208560	212200	And even if there's a possibility that the person is just faking it for clout, like I
212200	216700	brought up in my Demi Lovato video, there's a big story recently about Ollie London transitioning
216700	218440	their race to become Korean.
218440	221760	This was covered by Hassan, who hilariously had no argument against it.
221760	244880	It was also covered by Sargon and PewDiePie and others too.
244880	248180	But I think everybody's missing a crucial component of the conversation here.
248180	252100	That component is the difference between the liberal and progressive conceptions of
252100	253100	bigotry.
253100	257120	This logic applies to other transracial people as well, from Shaun King to Rachel Dolezal.
257120	261300	The progressives find themselves without any convincing arguments against transracialism
261300	265480	because they have already expelled the immutable characteristic from the bigotry equation.
265480	270480	If it really is all just identification, then however you identify must inherently be valid,
270480	272800	no matter what it is you're identifying as.
272800	276480	By the way, this is the core of the attack helicopter joke from years and years ago.
276480	297480	I'm glad progressives are finally beginning to catch on to this logic.
297480	302480	I remember at one point speaking to Lilith about her own transgenderism, and she colloquially
302480	306500	defined it as, I think I'm a girl and I can't stop.
306500	308500	There's two important takeaways from that.
308500	312700	One is that she's appealing to an immutable characteristic, that she cannot help but be
312700	313700	trans.
313700	317700	It doesn't matter if in some alternate timeline, she decided to not transition, and instead
317700	320080	outwardly appearing to be hyper-masculine.
320080	322660	She would always be this way inside her own head.
322660	324620	She would always be closeted.
324620	329460	And two, naturally following from one, she recognizes that she thinks she is a woman.
329460	333440	Not that she's actually biologically female and therefore sex doesn't exist and all
333440	334440	this other nonsense.
334440	337960	Lilith understands that she has gender dysphoria, that it is a mental disorder, and that her
337960	341820	being afflicted with it is the grounds that makes her treatment of it legitimate.
341820	343480	Part of that treatment is transitioning.
343480	346820	Part of that treatment is surrounding herself with people who accept her identity.
346820	349560	But she also understands that some people just won't do that.
349560	352420	They have the right not to, and she has the right not to associate with them.
352420	355660	This is what makes transgenderism valid within a liberal framework.
355660	359800	The understanding that it's not simply a matter of identity, but that it has an immutable,
359800	360800	medical component.
360800	364100	And that transitioning is not simply living your best life or being accepted for who you
364100	366880	are deep down, it's medical treatment.
366880	370620	Progressives fundamentally reject this liberal argument as transmedicalism.
370620	375780	The transmedicalist is somebody who believes that being transgender is contingent on experiencing
375780	380120	gender dysphoria, and that people who identify as transgender but don't experience gender
380120	384620	dysphoria and have no desire to transition are not truly transgender.
384620	389860	Progressives often deride transmedicalists as true scum, which stands for true transsexual
389860	393980	scum, referring to the practice of gatekeeping transness to people who actually experience
393980	395180	gender dysphoria.
395180	400380	The progressives also contrast true scum with too cute, standing for too cute to be cisgender.
400380	404140	Yes, I know that neither of these terms are acronyms, I never said this shit made any
404140	405140	sense.
405140	408940	The point is, there is a massive split between the trans people who genuinely cannot help
408940	413260	but be trans, and the trans people who believe that they are trans based solely on their
413260	414860	identity as such.
414860	419540	Liberal versus progressive, transmedicalist versus transtrender, immutable characteristic
419540	420540	versus identity.
420540	423240	It should be no surprise to you which side I fall on.
423240	427280	When Hassan spoke out against Olly London's transracialism on the grounds of it lacking
427280	431660	an immutable characteristic, his own chatroom rebelled against him, bringing up the spectre
431660	457260	of transmedicalism.
487260	494060	And if you're a progressive who already expelled the legitimacy of immutable characteristics
494060	498420	from your moral framework, then you have no leg to stand on when it comes to transracial
498420	499420	people.
499420	502200	Progressives have to fall back on liberal positions to object to this shit.
502200	504900	Like I said, this is an older phenomenon than just Olly London.
504900	506440	Other people have been doing this for a while now.
506440	510880	This is an article from 2019 complaining about Rachel Dolezal, titled Transracial is not
510880	512140	the New Transgender.
512140	514700	How do you think these people square their objection to it?
514700	519420	Unlike gender, which is assigned to you at birth, your race or ethnicity is rooted in
519420	520420	ancestry.
520420	523340	You can't inherit your gender, but you do inherit your race.
523340	526660	The fact that these people believe that they can pick and choose parts of their ethnicity
526660	530820	they want, and later decide to revert to their whiteness is white privilege at its worst.
530820	533860	Oh look, it's an appeal to immutable characteristics.
533860	538480	Of course, the truth is, you do actually inherit both your biological sex, and in many cases
538480	542460	your gender identity, from your parents, because we are not purely socially constructed beings.
542740	544820	Here's the real kicker though.
544820	549700	Progressives actually do believe in transracialism, but only when it benefits their politics.
549700	551540	Here's a viral Twitter thread from last year.
551540	553300	If you look white, you're white.
553300	556380	The concept of race is based on appearance.
556380	560020	So you're outward facing identity, not your immutable characteristics.
560020	562180	So yeah, you're white and you need to face that.
562180	567020	Yes, you can still be ethnically and culturally part of a non-white culture, but you are still
567020	568020	white.
568020	569300	Check your privilege and use it for good.
569300	571580	Maybe sometimes you're seen as white, but sometimes you're not.
571700	575300	Yet the mere fact that you can be seen as white at all is a privilege itself.
575300	577100	You can still be white and indigenous.
577100	579820	You can be white and have parents or siblings who are visibly non-white.
579820	582060	It doesn't cancel out your hardships.
582060	583700	Intersectionality will always be a thing.
583700	588060	Don't come into my mentions telling me about how your struggles as a white passing person
588060	590900	overshadow mine as a very visible Asian person.
590900	594780	I respect and encourage you to stay connected with your non-white culture, but don't act
594780	597740	like you know what it's like to be an actual person of color.
597740	601940	When the transracialism involves a white person transitioning to be another race, it's invalid,
601940	605860	it's blackface, it's whitey avoiding responsibility for their colonizing past.
605860	609620	But when the transracialism involves a non-white person looking more white than they actually
609620	614080	are, these activists are willing to completely expel people into the white race based on
614080	615080	colorism alone.
615080	618500	If you're a black person who is white passing, you ain't black, I guess.
618500	623800	It's almost as if non-white racial identities are cherished and protected as something exclusive
623800	624800	by these people.
624860	628600	As a side note, it will always be weird to me to watch progressives fall back on the
628600	633340	one-drop rule in order to justify their strict ethnic segregationism, despite completely
633340	636960	avoiding biology as they abolish gender segregationism.
636960	641900	The separate but equal doctrine in American law was enshrined by the Plessy vs Ferguson
641900	644080	lawsuit in 1896.
644080	647960	Homer Plessy, who was one-eighth black and therefore legally considered to be a black
647960	652620	man because American law cared about race in that way at that time, and despite appearing
652620	657880	entirely white, was forced out of the first class carriage of a train back into the colored
657880	660600	carriage despite having a first class ticket.
660600	665960	Over 100 years later, people similarly complain about pretendians like Elizabeth Warren who
665960	671400	use some distant Native American ancestry to gain advantages, despite being almost entirely
671400	672400	white.
672400	675480	Both are bigotry, both are unfair, both are fundamentally anti-liberal.
675480	679800	We can object to this stuff because our formulation of bigotry is still intact, it's not just
679800	683520	how you identify, it's also your immutable characteristics that determines legitimate
683520	684520	bigotry.
684520	687620	In removing the immutable characteristics from their arguments, progressives have no
687620	692220	reply to any of this, and if that's the case, there is no argument against stuff like
692220	693320	this too.
693320	698360	Why not simply define yourself as not white but 75% French and 25% Belgian?
698360	701220	If white people today are going to take the blame for shit they didn't do on the grounds
701220	704740	of ancestral guilt, why not just identify yourself out of whiteness?
704740	705740	Fuck it.
705740	710900	Why, from a liberal perspective, we see progressives as being racist, sexist, homophobic and so
710900	714740	on because their conception of bigotry inevitably leads to more bigotry.
714740	718500	The progressive in stripping away the immutable characteristic from the equation becomes permissive
718500	722660	of a whole bunch of terrible stuff that liberals correctly view as bigoted.
722660	726740	Their only way out is to double down on their bigotry or fall back to our position once
726740	728060	they can no longer stand lying.
