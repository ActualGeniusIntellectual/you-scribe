00:00.000 --> 00:09.280
In my Scott Cawthon video, I outlined the following principle, and since we're going

00:09.280 --> 00:12.840
to be using it again today, it's probably a good idea to dig into it a bit more deeply.

00:12.840 --> 00:17.160
I mentioned that if you had an immutable characteristic that you publicly identified with, you could

00:17.160 --> 00:18.720
experience bigotry for it.

00:18.720 --> 00:22.980
For example, if you outwardly identified as a gay man, and you had the immutable characteristic

00:22.980 --> 00:26.260
of being gay, you might face homophobia from some people.

00:26.260 --> 00:31.100
To anybody who is liberal-minded, to anybody who values fairness as a principle, this isn't

00:31.100 --> 00:32.100
right.

00:32.100 --> 00:35.140
It makes no sense to hold somebody back in life for something that they cannot help and

00:35.140 --> 00:36.140
cannot change.

00:36.140 --> 00:37.580
That seems simple enough, right?

00:37.580 --> 00:41.260
That was the backbone of gay marriage activism, back when that was still a relevant social

00:41.260 --> 00:42.260
issue.

00:42.260 --> 00:43.660
You know, being born that way.

00:43.660 --> 00:49.140
I still believe this to be fundamentally true, but when you poison this equation with intersectionality,

00:49.140 --> 00:53.460
when you replace the fairness of liberalism with the equity of progressivism, we can watch

00:53.460 --> 00:56.420
in real time this formulation crumble away.

00:56.420 --> 01:00.980
The liberal conception of bigotry requires both components to be real homophobia, the

01:00.980 --> 01:03.260
identity and the immutable characteristic.

01:03.260 --> 01:04.800
That should seem obvious.

01:04.800 --> 01:08.660
For example, if you're a closeted gay man, and let's say that you're closeted enough

01:08.660 --> 01:12.300
that others can't really tell that you're gay, if you have the immutable characteristic

01:12.300 --> 01:17.580
of being gay, but not that public persona, you're not actually going to experience homophobia,

01:17.580 --> 01:19.500
at least not directed at you.

01:19.500 --> 01:23.600
There are, of course, also instances where you cannot actually conceal the identity.

01:23.600 --> 01:27.540
For example, you can't be a closeted black man, you're always going to have that outward

01:27.540 --> 01:29.220
signifier due to your skin color.

01:29.220 --> 01:33.500
The legitimate racism that black people face comes from the public identification of their

01:33.500 --> 01:36.780
blackness, plus the immutable characteristic that is their ethnicity.

01:36.780 --> 01:41.020
What progressives began to notice, however, is that people who had the identity, but not

01:41.020 --> 01:45.900
the immutable characteristic, could also experience something that, on the surface, seemed like

01:45.900 --> 01:46.900
bigotry.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.140
Let's assume a man who isn't actually gay at all.

01:49.140 --> 01:52.900
He lacks the immutable characteristic of being gay, but he outwardly presents as very

01:52.900 --> 01:58.020
feminine and camp, and you know, stereotypically gay, even though he's not.

01:58.020 --> 02:02.220
If that individual were to be placed in a social situation where a gay person might

02:02.220 --> 02:07.020
experience homophobia, he too would be given shit for his outward behaviors by those same

02:07.020 --> 02:08.020
people.

02:08.020 --> 02:11.940
However, where the progressives went wrong, was in assuming that this negativity was actually

02:11.940 --> 02:17.100
homophobia, of the exact same stripe that a legitimately gay man would face, however,

02:17.100 --> 02:18.100
it's not.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.860
After all, he's not actually gay.

02:19.860 --> 02:23.780
Maybe it's anti-male sentiment, maybe it's anti-femboy sentiment, though I can see why

02:23.780 --> 02:27.940
the progs, for political reasons, would not want to admit that those two forms of bigotry

02:27.940 --> 02:29.280
actually exist.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.580
Maybe it's not bigotry at all, maybe they're just making fun of him for being a wimp.

02:32.580 --> 02:34.260
Maybe he actually does need to toughen up a little bit.

02:34.260 --> 02:35.300
Maybe not, who knows?

02:35.300 --> 02:40.260
But the point is, within the liberal framework we're talking about here, this isn't homophobia

02:40.260 --> 02:42.520
because there's no actual gay people involved.

02:42.520 --> 02:46.200
By the way, this is why I think two white people who jokingly say the n-word to each

02:46.200 --> 02:50.240
other aren't actually racist, because I don't believe language is a magic spell that you

02:50.240 --> 02:53.160
cast to make the universe incrementally better or worse.

02:53.160 --> 02:57.240
However, if we accept the progressive framework rather than the liberal one on this issue,

02:57.240 --> 03:00.600
if we were to actually believe that the feminine guy getting flacked for being feminine is

03:00.600 --> 03:06.640
somehow actually homophobia, and not simply anti-male or anti-fem or just people being

03:06.640 --> 03:11.220
assholes, then it logically follows that in order to experience bigotry, you don't actually

03:11.220 --> 03:14.520
need the immutable characteristic, only the identity.

03:14.520 --> 03:17.560
You don't need to be gay to experience homophobia.

03:17.560 --> 03:21.800
And what logically follows from that is people demanding all of their identities be respected

03:21.800 --> 03:26.720
as valid, all the way down to mental illnesses or associations with fandoms and subcultures,

03:26.720 --> 03:28.560
and yes, transracialism.

03:28.560 --> 03:32.200
And even if there's a possibility that the person is just faking it for clout, like I

03:32.200 --> 03:36.700
brought up in my Demi Lovato video, there's a big story recently about Ollie London transitioning

03:36.700 --> 03:38.440
their race to become Korean.

03:38.440 --> 03:41.760
This was covered by Hassan, who hilariously had no argument against it.

03:41.760 --> 04:04.880
It was also covered by Sargon and PewDiePie and others too.

04:04.880 --> 04:08.180
But I think everybody's missing a crucial component of the conversation here.

04:08.180 --> 04:12.100
That component is the difference between the liberal and progressive conceptions of

04:12.100 --> 04:13.100
bigotry.

04:13.100 --> 04:17.120
This logic applies to other transracial people as well, from Shaun King to Rachel Dolezal.

04:17.120 --> 04:21.300
The progressives find themselves without any convincing arguments against transracialism

04:21.300 --> 04:25.480
because they have already expelled the immutable characteristic from the bigotry equation.

04:25.480 --> 04:30.480
If it really is all just identification, then however you identify must inherently be valid,

04:30.480 --> 04:32.800
no matter what it is you're identifying as.

04:32.800 --> 04:36.480
By the way, this is the core of the attack helicopter joke from years and years ago.

04:36.480 --> 04:57.480
I'm glad progressives are finally beginning to catch on to this logic.

04:57.480 --> 05:02.480
I remember at one point speaking to Lilith about her own transgenderism, and she colloquially

05:02.480 --> 05:06.500
defined it as, I think I'm a girl and I can't stop.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.500
There's two important takeaways from that.

05:08.500 --> 05:12.700
One is that she's appealing to an immutable characteristic, that she cannot help but be

05:12.700 --> 05:13.700
trans.

05:13.700 --> 05:17.700
It doesn't matter if in some alternate timeline, she decided to not transition, and instead

05:17.700 --> 05:20.080
outwardly appearing to be hyper-masculine.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.660
She would always be this way inside her own head.

05:22.660 --> 05:24.620
She would always be closeted.

05:24.620 --> 05:29.460
And two, naturally following from one, she recognizes that she thinks she is a woman.

05:29.460 --> 05:33.440
Not that she's actually biologically female and therefore sex doesn't exist and all

05:33.440 --> 05:34.440
this other nonsense.

05:34.440 --> 05:37.960
Lilith understands that she has gender dysphoria, that it is a mental disorder, and that her

05:37.960 --> 05:41.820
being afflicted with it is the grounds that makes her treatment of it legitimate.

05:41.820 --> 05:43.480
Part of that treatment is transitioning.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.820
Part of that treatment is surrounding herself with people who accept her identity.

05:46.820 --> 05:49.560
But she also understands that some people just won't do that.

05:49.560 --> 05:52.420
They have the right not to, and she has the right not to associate with them.

05:52.420 --> 05:55.660
This is what makes transgenderism valid within a liberal framework.

05:55.660 --> 05:59.800
The understanding that it's not simply a matter of identity, but that it has an immutable,

05:59.800 --> 06:00.800
medical component.

06:00.800 --> 06:04.100
And that transitioning is not simply living your best life or being accepted for who you

06:04.100 --> 06:06.880
are deep down, it's medical treatment.

06:06.880 --> 06:10.620
Progressives fundamentally reject this liberal argument as transmedicalism.

06:10.620 --> 06:15.780
The transmedicalist is somebody who believes that being transgender is contingent on experiencing

06:15.780 --> 06:20.120
gender dysphoria, and that people who identify as transgender but don't experience gender

06:20.120 --> 06:24.620
dysphoria and have no desire to transition are not truly transgender.

06:24.620 --> 06:29.860
Progressives often deride transmedicalists as true scum, which stands for true transsexual

06:29.860 --> 06:33.980
scum, referring to the practice of gatekeeping transness to people who actually experience

06:33.980 --> 06:35.180
gender dysphoria.

06:35.180 --> 06:40.380
The progressives also contrast true scum with too cute, standing for too cute to be cisgender.

06:40.380 --> 06:44.140
Yes, I know that neither of these terms are acronyms, I never said this shit made any

06:44.140 --> 06:45.140
sense.

06:45.140 --> 06:48.940
The point is, there is a massive split between the trans people who genuinely cannot help

06:48.940 --> 06:53.260
but be trans, and the trans people who believe that they are trans based solely on their

06:53.260 --> 06:54.860
identity as such.

06:54.860 --> 06:59.540
Liberal versus progressive, transmedicalist versus transtrender, immutable characteristic

06:59.540 --> 07:00.540
versus identity.

07:00.540 --> 07:03.240
It should be no surprise to you which side I fall on.

07:03.240 --> 07:07.280
When Hassan spoke out against Olly London's transracialism on the grounds of it lacking

07:07.280 --> 07:11.660
an immutable characteristic, his own chatroom rebelled against him, bringing up the spectre

07:11.660 --> 07:37.260
of transmedicalism.

08:07.260 --> 08:14.060
And if you're a progressive who already expelled the legitimacy of immutable characteristics

08:14.060 --> 08:18.420
from your moral framework, then you have no leg to stand on when it comes to transracial

08:18.420 --> 08:19.420
people.

08:19.420 --> 08:22.200
Progressives have to fall back on liberal positions to object to this shit.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.900
Like I said, this is an older phenomenon than just Olly London.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.440
Other people have been doing this for a while now.

08:26.440 --> 08:30.880
This is an article from 2019 complaining about Rachel Dolezal, titled Transracial is not

08:30.880 --> 08:32.140
the New Transgender.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.700
How do you think these people square their objection to it?

08:34.700 --> 08:39.420
Unlike gender, which is assigned to you at birth, your race or ethnicity is rooted in

08:39.420 --> 08:40.420
ancestry.

08:40.420 --> 08:43.340
You can't inherit your gender, but you do inherit your race.

08:43.340 --> 08:46.660
The fact that these people believe that they can pick and choose parts of their ethnicity

08:46.660 --> 08:50.820
they want, and later decide to revert to their whiteness is white privilege at its worst.

08:50.820 --> 08:53.860
Oh look, it's an appeal to immutable characteristics.

08:53.860 --> 08:58.480
Of course, the truth is, you do actually inherit both your biological sex, and in many cases

08:58.480 --> 09:02.460
your gender identity, from your parents, because we are not purely socially constructed beings.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.820
Here's the real kicker though.

09:04.820 --> 09:09.700
Progressives actually do believe in transracialism, but only when it benefits their politics.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.540
Here's a viral Twitter thread from last year.

09:11.540 --> 09:13.300
If you look white, you're white.

09:13.300 --> 09:16.380
The concept of race is based on appearance.

09:16.380 --> 09:20.020
So you're outward facing identity, not your immutable characteristics.

09:20.020 --> 09:22.180
So yeah, you're white and you need to face that.

09:22.180 --> 09:27.020
Yes, you can still be ethnically and culturally part of a non-white culture, but you are still

09:27.020 --> 09:28.020
white.

09:28.020 --> 09:29.300
Check your privilege and use it for good.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.580
Maybe sometimes you're seen as white, but sometimes you're not.

09:31.700 --> 09:35.300
Yet the mere fact that you can be seen as white at all is a privilege itself.

09:35.300 --> 09:37.100
You can still be white and indigenous.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.820
You can be white and have parents or siblings who are visibly non-white.

09:39.820 --> 09:42.060
It doesn't cancel out your hardships.

09:42.060 --> 09:43.700
Intersectionality will always be a thing.

09:43.700 --> 09:48.060
Don't come into my mentions telling me about how your struggles as a white passing person

09:48.060 --> 09:50.900
overshadow mine as a very visible Asian person.

09:50.900 --> 09:54.780
I respect and encourage you to stay connected with your non-white culture, but don't act

09:54.780 --> 09:57.740
like you know what it's like to be an actual person of color.

09:57.740 --> 10:01.940
When the transracialism involves a white person transitioning to be another race, it's invalid,

10:01.940 --> 10:05.860
it's blackface, it's whitey avoiding responsibility for their colonizing past.

10:05.860 --> 10:09.620
But when the transracialism involves a non-white person looking more white than they actually

10:09.620 --> 10:14.080
are, these activists are willing to completely expel people into the white race based on

10:14.080 --> 10:15.080
colorism alone.

10:15.080 --> 10:18.500
If you're a black person who is white passing, you ain't black, I guess.

10:18.500 --> 10:23.800
It's almost as if non-white racial identities are cherished and protected as something exclusive

10:23.800 --> 10:24.800
by these people.

10:24.860 --> 10:28.600
As a side note, it will always be weird to me to watch progressives fall back on the

10:28.600 --> 10:33.340
one-drop rule in order to justify their strict ethnic segregationism, despite completely

10:33.340 --> 10:36.960
avoiding biology as they abolish gender segregationism.

10:36.960 --> 10:41.900
The separate but equal doctrine in American law was enshrined by the Plessy vs Ferguson

10:41.900 --> 10:44.080
lawsuit in 1896.

10:44.080 --> 10:47.960
Homer Plessy, who was one-eighth black and therefore legally considered to be a black

10:47.960 --> 10:52.620
man because American law cared about race in that way at that time, and despite appearing

10:52.620 --> 10:57.880
entirely white, was forced out of the first class carriage of a train back into the colored

10:57.880 --> 11:00.600
carriage despite having a first class ticket.

11:00.600 --> 11:05.960
Over 100 years later, people similarly complain about pretendians like Elizabeth Warren who

11:05.960 --> 11:11.400
use some distant Native American ancestry to gain advantages, despite being almost entirely

11:11.400 --> 11:12.400
white.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.480
Both are bigotry, both are unfair, both are fundamentally anti-liberal.

11:15.480 --> 11:19.800
We can object to this stuff because our formulation of bigotry is still intact, it's not just

11:19.800 --> 11:23.520
how you identify, it's also your immutable characteristics that determines legitimate

11:23.520 --> 11:24.520
bigotry.

11:24.520 --> 11:27.620
In removing the immutable characteristics from their arguments, progressives have no

11:27.620 --> 11:32.220
reply to any of this, and if that's the case, there is no argument against stuff like

11:32.220 --> 11:33.320
this too.

11:33.320 --> 11:38.360
Why not simply define yourself as not white but 75% French and 25% Belgian?

11:38.360 --> 11:41.220
If white people today are going to take the blame for shit they didn't do on the grounds

11:41.220 --> 11:44.740
of ancestral guilt, why not just identify yourself out of whiteness?

11:44.740 --> 11:45.740
Fuck it.

11:45.740 --> 11:50.900
Why, from a liberal perspective, we see progressives as being racist, sexist, homophobic and so

11:50.900 --> 11:54.740
on because their conception of bigotry inevitably leads to more bigotry.

11:54.740 --> 11:58.500
The progressive in stripping away the immutable characteristic from the equation becomes permissive

11:58.500 --> 12:02.660
of a whole bunch of terrible stuff that liberals correctly view as bigoted.

12:02.660 --> 12:06.740
Their only way out is to double down on their bigotry or fall back to our position once

12:06.740 --> 12:08.060
they can no longer stand lying.
