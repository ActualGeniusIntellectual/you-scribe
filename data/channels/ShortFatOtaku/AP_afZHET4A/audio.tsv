0	12520	My friends, today it is time to talk about acting white. Because it's 2021, whiteness
12520	18160	is not simply having a skin colour, it is a way of behaviour. At least that's what the
18160	22120	woke lefties tell me. And also the white supremacists.
22120	26820	If you've been paying attention, you'll notice that a lot of different races are now part
26820	32780	of the white race, or alternatively part of the black race. For example, Jason Wardell,
32780	39460	a teacher with Mediterranean and Jewish heritage, is left bewildered as his trade union insists
39460	44940	he is black despite telling him that he's not. Behold, a black man.
44940	50840	Mr Wardell, who is a design technology teacher, was invited by the National Education Union
50840	57380	to a meeting of black teachers. The NEU says it treats black as a political term rather
57380	63780	than a signifier of African heritage. Therefore, the term includes all members who self-identify
63780	70400	as black, Asian, and any other minority ethnic group who don't identify themselves as white.
70400	75240	When Mr Wardell contacted the union to say that he wasn't black, the NEU informed him
75240	80580	that since he did not consider himself white, he had to be registered as such.
80580	85300	Jewish was an option in the religion section only, which leads me to believe that the NEU
85300	90080	doesn't recognize Jewish as a race. I don't feel like an actual black member would necessarily
90080	95300	want me down as a black member, and rightly so. Of course, it's definitely not just Jewish
95300	102740	people who get forced into the false dichotomy of white or black, but it's also Arabs, Persians,
102740	107480	and other people from the Middle East. Remember, JonTron is a white supremacist, apparently.
107480	112820	But check out this article here, Prescriptive Racialism and Racial Exclusion, written by
112820	117420	a man named Muhammad Ali. No, not the great one, this is somebody else.
117420	121980	The crowd outside the auditorium was growing larger and louder. Controversy had arisen
121980	127040	over the panel on religious extremism in the Middle East that I had organized at my university.
127040	131240	A petition to cancel the event in the wake of the horrific New Zealand massacre had been
131240	135680	circulated among the student body during the previous week, forcing my co-organizers and
135680	139980	me to defend ourselves against accusations of Islamophobia. Months of work had gone into
139980	144080	the event, and I even managed to secure funding for the speakers on the condition that the
144080	147780	event went ahead. At that moment, it looked like I was going to fail. The Students for
147780	151480	Democratic Society were protesting it, and they spooked the president of the College
151480	156760	Republicans who were now considering cancelling it. Finally, one of our panelists, an imam,
156760	160120	managed to persuade the College Republican president to go ahead. Despite the constant
160120	164300	heckling during the speaker's remarks and the Q&A session that followed, the event did
164300	169520	finally proceed as planned. The panel and I addressed the New Zealand atrocity and explicitly
169520	174140	condemned white nationalism, but the protesters remained unmoved and even interrupted the
174140	177520	moment of silence for the massacre's victims. Throughout the event, they held a banner that
177520	182780	read You Do Not Represent Us. After the event, I overheard a protester berate one of the
182780	187820	panelists and complain that the event had not been organized by an Arab. I interjected
187820	192040	to inform her that I was the organizer of the event and that I am indeed an Arab. You
192040	196280	don't count, she immediately retorted. We know your politics. I subsequently discovered
196280	200860	this woman was the president of the Arab Student Association. I was already aware of this practice
200860	205480	of Uncle Tomming members of minorities who challenged certain orthodoxies, but this was
205480	209840	the first time I had experienced it firsthand. Such attitudes were evident in many of the
209840	214200	protesters' objections to the event. Faisal Saeed Al Muttar, an Iraqi-born secular rights
214200	218680	advocate and the only Arab on the panel, bore the brunt of these attacks. He was denounced
218680	223000	as a puppet and a traitor for discussing the role of religion in motivating groups
223000	227080	like ISIS in his native country. And this does seem to be an accurate description of
227080	232000	how the intersectionalists operate when it comes to race. To use this Ayanna Pressley
232000	260880	quote for I think, like, the sixth time on this channel.
260880	264720	You're not black unless you think black. You're not Arab unless you think Arab. There
264720	269240	is a large section of socialists, especially online right now, who have moved past the
269240	275040	idea that race is simply some kind of genetic marker, but is actually a way of thinking,
275040	279920	feeling and viewing the world. It is no longer an immutable trait, but rather it's an ideology
279920	286040	that you adopt. This is how, after all, straight black men are the white people of black people.
286040	290320	This is a ridiculous statement in a ridiculous headline of a ridiculous article on a ridiculous
290320	294040	website. But this is where critical theory leads you. If the dominant culture really
294040	300520	is whiteness, if it's the white cis-normative hetero-patriarchal capitalist whatever, then
300520	305280	every step that you're closer to that, you're more white. And using this lens, completely
305280	312200	stupid concepts like having a colonized mind or internalized misogyny or whatever the fuck,
312200	316640	they all completely make sense. The way in which these people view the world is fundamentally
316640	321320	flawed, but within that framework, of course all this regressive nonsense would show up.
321320	325900	In fact, using this logic, if you were to show somebody like Ayanna Pressley, these
325900	330420	black women, she might actually call them white men. Of course, the political advantage
330420	335080	of this point of view is that you can basically define anybody however you like, for whatever
335080	339200	reason serves your purposes that day. For example, a school district decides Asians
339200	344360	aren't students of color. Administrators at North Thurston Public Schools, which oversees
344360	350160	some 16,000 students, have lumped Asians in with whites and measured their academic
350160	356240	achievements against students of color, a category that includes black, Latinx, Native
356240	361760	American, Pacific Islander, and multiracial students. Where's the Arabs, North Thurston?
361760	366480	Where's the Jews, you fucking racists? Where's the Indians? Oh wait, the Indians are actually
366480	370240	pretty successful. Maybe they count as white too. The meme that Asians are whites is something
370240	376000	that's reasonably widespread. I think I actually did a joking video about it a few years ago
376000	380440	about the alt-right's Asian fetish. It's not just the alt-right though. I know Louis Laveau
380440	384840	has been saying, the future of the white race is to mix them with Asians. I think he just
384840	389880	says he wants an Asian girlfriend, to be honest. But still, this is some weird South African
389880	394240	apartheid style shit, isn't it? We're actually at the point where woke people are giving
394240	400220	us honorary whites. What does that make Tim Pool? Tim Pool's half white, half Asian. Is
400220	405900	he a super white? Don't be obtuse. Asians definitely have privilege over every other
405900	411560	minority due to their close proximity to whiteness. It's like I said, it's intersectional bullshit.
411560	416180	The closer you are to whiteness, the more that the commies think they can just discriminate
416180	421740	against you. But what is this whiteness? What is this colonizing ideology? Let's see if
421740	427060	we can figure it out. White people food is creating an unobtainable picture of health.
427060	436220	Alright, so I got it. I got it. If you eat healthy, you're white. Okay. I thought depression
436220	441100	was a white people disease. A conversation with depressed while black. If you have mental
441100	447220	health problems, you're white. Okay, got it. Philly rapper Pop Hunna is getting blackballed
447220	452580	by the industry for paperwork of him cooperating with police when he was 13. His friend was
452580	457020	killed in front of him and his mom. It's becoming a debate because of his age at the time. Well,
457540	462340	it's also becoming a debate because cooperating with the police when your friend gets killed
462340	469340	in front of you is apparently bad like fucking fucking what this no snitch culture is, in
469340	474220	my opinion, ridiculous. Are we are we actually at the point where we're saying that, you
474220	479740	know, not being a fucking gangster is being white is that whiteness now is getting out
479740	485020	of the hood and being successful whiteness. Pretending you don't have feelings as a colonized
485020	491460	white ass reaction. My ancestors honored their emotions and so the fuck will I so having
491460	496820	discipline or reacting appropriately to a situation or being at least somewhat of a
496820	505300	rational person. That's whiteness. Intelligence is a white man's mythology. A phantasmal concept
505300	512180	a non referring turn sin catagrammatic. Alright, got it. If you're smart, you're white. I understand.
512180	516500	I understand you fucking white supremacist. But of course, we would get here eventually.
516500	522020	How else would you characterize the proud boys as a white supremacist group when regardless
522020	526500	of their politics, their racial makeup is actually quite diverse? Well, the Washington
526500	532580	Post tells us to understand Trump support, we must think in terms of multi racial whiteness.
532580	537580	To these people, a black person who doesn't think black, which means you know, be a lefty
537580	542740	vote Democrat, whatever has colonized thinking he has whiteness on his side, multi racial
542740	546940	whiteness. In fact, is anybody surprised that the article is written by Christina Beltran,
546940	552480	who is a very white woman. The article itself is opinion piece garbage, which you expect
552480	556520	from the Washington Post nowadays. But Christina Beltran gave a very interesting interview
556520	560640	that I think we should probably listen to. I want to read what you wrote in part for
560640	565500	voters who see the very act of acknowledging one's racial identity as itself racist, the
565500	571780	politics of multiracial whiteness reinforces their desired approach to colorblind individualism.
571780	577180	Can you explain what you mean? Sure. I think that one of the things that's interesting
577180	583500	about the politics of multicultural conservatism, for example, is that multicultural conservatism,
583500	587860	which is the kind of conservative politics of reaching out to other racial minorities
587860	594680	practiced by folks like Jack Kemp or George W. Bush, was an effort to recognize the specific
594680	598460	histories and backgrounds of particular racial populations, and to say that they could be
598460	603700	part of the GOP. And I think that one of the things that's interesting is that there's
603700	608880	a segment of people of color, who don't necessarily want to be recognized at all, they don't want
608880	613320	to be recognized for their racial distinctiveness, right, that for them, the very act of sort
613320	619280	of identifying them as Latino as African American, that they themselves have a certain discomfort
619280	623460	with that very logic, they want to be understood as simply Americans, outside of those kinds
623460	627300	of identity categories. I think that one of the big political divides we face right
627300	632640	now is people who find the very act of talking about those histories of racial exclusion
632640	638080	as divisive, because the act of talking about it and acknowledging it produces a kind of
638080	642820	defensiveness or anger, and even discussing it, the idea that unity should be practiced
642820	647660	from sort of not engaging with our history, not sort of celebrating the best stuff, and
647660	654100	not really acknowledging that we have a complicated, beautiful, tragic, inspiring inheritance
654100	657340	that we have to understand to go forward.
657340	663820	So let me get this straight. According to this person, the problem is non-white people
663820	670260	who don't like identity politics, and how they react when identity politics are forced
670260	676020	on them. We have to understand this to go forward. So if you're a non-white person who's
676020	681900	not idpol obsessed, to Beltran, you're a backwards regressive element. You might even
681900	685420	say a reactionary. This is some ridiculous bullshit, guys.
685420	691380	And is anybody surprised that, say, right-leaning people are beginning to latch onto this multiracial
691380	696460	whiteness? I mean, look at this. This guy could basically be a young Ian Miles Chong.
696460	702000	And of course white people are never racially discriminated against. Of course. Especially
702000	706520	if you're one of those multiracial whites, then nothing that happens to you is actually
706520	710040	discrimination. Because you've internalized all of that colonization or whatever the fuck
710040	715900	they'd say. Look at this picture, dude. Mm-hmm. The votes of black Americans should count
715900	722960	twice. Vote reparations would empower us to replace oppressive institutions with life-affirming
722960	729720	structures of equality. By Brandon Hasbrook. Look at this pale-ass Sean King motherfucker.
729720	734080	What are you, like, one-eighth black? I swear to God, my skin is darker than yours because
734080	735280	I'm half Italian.
735280	740760	Orlando Hall was executed last night. Hall was a black man convicted by an all-white
740760	745600	jury. He is the eighth person executed this year by the Trump administration. Orlando
745600	753080	Hall kidnapped, raped, and buried a 16-year-old girl alive. Fuck your race card. He is not
753080	757880	more innocent simply because of his skin color. But if you're an intersectionalist, you have
757880	762800	to go to bat for these people. Because that is where intersectionality takes you. Dear
762800	768180	white and Asian people, stop going to black churches to get vaccinated. These sites are
768180	773880	prioritizing black people. After they got dogpiled, we don't have time to educate all
773880	778720	communities on equity and the importance of the black church. To our Asian followers,
778720	783720	we don't have time to educate your community on disenfranchisement and anti-black racism.
783720	789960	We are working to promote equity on very level. A lot of racist messages have come
789960	796120	our way from the Asian community about our post. As a community, we are dying from COVID-19
796120	800920	and double digits with our counterparts in the Latino slash X communities. We stand by
800920	806960	what we said. Blah, blah, blah. And of course, of course violence against Asians is not a
806960	812720	hate crime because they're white, right? Of course the roof Koreans were all just oppressors
812720	818080	in the end. Of course, when black people attack Asian people randomly on the street,
818080	824120	they're simply punching up. Violence against Asian Americans and why the term hate crime
824120	829180	should be used carefully. Social media posts have conflated violence against people who
829180	835220	are Asian American with hate crimes against the community at large. That is what happens
835220	840120	whenever there is violence against somebody who is black. It's always made into a race
840120	845320	question. It's always tied into the community at large, but let's be fucking real here.
845320	852160	Jacob Blake was shot by police while trying to abduct children. Rayshard Brooks, regardless
852160	857700	of him being a scumbag in other areas of his life, was a danger on multiple levels from
857700	862920	driving drunk to fighting with the cops. And although George Floyd's situation was exacerbated
862920	870320	by admittedly terrible actions from the police officers, he still ultimately overdosed. Every
870320	876760	single time a black person dies, it becomes a community thing. It becomes a racial thing,
876760	882100	whether it's warranted or not. And now people have the gall to say, don't make it an Asian
882100	888160	thing when Asian people are targeted and attacked. They say don't use the hashtag Asian lives
888160	893800	matter because no lives matter until black lives do. At least according to the Twitterati,
893800	902040	sometimes Asian people are actually the victim of a race based crime, especially if it's a white
902040	906360	person who commits it. So there was a shooting I think about a week ago where a white person shot
906360	911920	and killed eight people, six of whom were Asian American. And because the shooting happened at
911920	918000	a spa, they may or may not have been sex workers. And despite the left throwing the Asians under the
918000	922360	bus this whole time, suddenly now it was all about race. It was all about people of color.
922360	928480	It was all about whiteness and white violence. And then as soon as it came out that the shooting
928480	935080	appeared not to be racially motivated, people were up in arms. But here's the actual truth.
935080	942160	Anybody can experience discrimination. This was not even considered a controversial opinion,
942160	947980	at least when I was young. The 90s and the 2000s were full of PSAs that said racism against
947980	955240	anybody was bad, including white people. Yes, Shakaran, they said the Irish experienced racism
955240	962540	because they did. Because everyone has. Every group of people on the face of this planet has
962540	968380	been both the oppressed and the oppressor class. And it ultimately doesn't matter. Really, it
968380	973860	doesn't. What matters is what people are doing today. What crimes are they committing today?
973860	979540	What racial othering are they committing today? What denying of culture or identity are they
979540	985980	committing today? And today, all of that absolutely terrible shit seems to be coming from the left.
