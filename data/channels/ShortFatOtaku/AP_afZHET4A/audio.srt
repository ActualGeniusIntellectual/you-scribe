00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,520
My friends, today it is time to talk about acting white. Because it's 2021, whiteness

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:18,160
is not simply having a skin colour, it is a way of behaviour. At least that's what the

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,120
woke lefties tell me. And also the white supremacists.

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,820
If you've been paying attention, you'll notice that a lot of different races are now part

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,780
of the white race, or alternatively part of the black race. For example, Jason Wardell,

6
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:39,460
a teacher with Mediterranean and Jewish heritage, is left bewildered as his trade union insists

7
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:44,940
he is black despite telling him that he's not. Behold, a black man.

8
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,840
Mr Wardell, who is a design technology teacher, was invited by the National Education Union

9
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:57,380
to a meeting of black teachers. The NEU says it treats black as a political term rather

10
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:03,780
than a signifier of African heritage. Therefore, the term includes all members who self-identify

11
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,400
as black, Asian, and any other minority ethnic group who don't identify themselves as white.

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,240
When Mr Wardell contacted the union to say that he wasn't black, the NEU informed him

13
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,580
that since he did not consider himself white, he had to be registered as such.

14
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,300
Jewish was an option in the religion section only, which leads me to believe that the NEU

15
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:30,080
doesn't recognize Jewish as a race. I don't feel like an actual black member would necessarily

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,300
want me down as a black member, and rightly so. Of course, it's definitely not just Jewish

17
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:42,740
people who get forced into the false dichotomy of white or black, but it's also Arabs, Persians,

18
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,480
and other people from the Middle East. Remember, JonTron is a white supremacist, apparently.

19
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,820
But check out this article here, Prescriptive Racialism and Racial Exclusion, written by

20
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,420
a man named Muhammad Ali. No, not the great one, this is somebody else.

21
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,980
The crowd outside the auditorium was growing larger and louder. Controversy had arisen

22
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,040
over the panel on religious extremism in the Middle East that I had organized at my university.

23
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,240
A petition to cancel the event in the wake of the horrific New Zealand massacre had been

24
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,680
circulated among the student body during the previous week, forcing my co-organizers and

25
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,980
me to defend ourselves against accusations of Islamophobia. Months of work had gone into

26
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,080
the event, and I even managed to secure funding for the speakers on the condition that the

27
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,780
event went ahead. At that moment, it looked like I was going to fail. The Students for

28
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,480
Democratic Society were protesting it, and they spooked the president of the College

29
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,760
Republicans who were now considering cancelling it. Finally, one of our panelists, an imam,

30
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,120
managed to persuade the College Republican president to go ahead. Despite the constant

31
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,300
heckling during the speaker's remarks and the Q&A session that followed, the event did

32
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,520
finally proceed as planned. The panel and I addressed the New Zealand atrocity and explicitly

33
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,140
condemned white nationalism, but the protesters remained unmoved and even interrupted the

34
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,520
moment of silence for the massacre's victims. Throughout the event, they held a banner that

35
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,780
read You Do Not Represent Us. After the event, I overheard a protester berate one of the

36
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,820
panelists and complain that the event had not been organized by an Arab. I interjected

37
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,040
to inform her that I was the organizer of the event and that I am indeed an Arab. You

38
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,280
don't count, she immediately retorted. We know your politics. I subsequently discovered

39
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,860
this woman was the president of the Arab Student Association. I was already aware of this practice

40
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,480
of Uncle Tomming members of minorities who challenged certain orthodoxies, but this was

41
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,840
the first time I had experienced it firsthand. Such attitudes were evident in many of the

42
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,200
protesters' objections to the event. Faisal Saeed Al Muttar, an Iraqi-born secular rights

43
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,680
advocate and the only Arab on the panel, bore the brunt of these attacks. He was denounced

44
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,000
as a puppet and a traitor for discussing the role of religion in motivating groups

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,080
like ISIS in his native country. And this does seem to be an accurate description of

46
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,000
how the intersectionalists operate when it comes to race. To use this Ayanna Pressley

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:20,880
quote for I think, like, the sixth time on this channel.

48
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,720
You're not black unless you think black. You're not Arab unless you think Arab. There

49
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,240
is a large section of socialists, especially online right now, who have moved past the

50
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:35,040
idea that race is simply some kind of genetic marker, but is actually a way of thinking,

51
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,920
feeling and viewing the world. It is no longer an immutable trait, but rather it's an ideology

52
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:46,040
that you adopt. This is how, after all, straight black men are the white people of black people.

53
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,320
This is a ridiculous statement in a ridiculous headline of a ridiculous article on a ridiculous

54
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,040
website. But this is where critical theory leads you. If the dominant culture really

55
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:00,520
is whiteness, if it's the white cis-normative hetero-patriarchal capitalist whatever, then

56
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,280
every step that you're closer to that, you're more white. And using this lens, completely

57
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:12,200
stupid concepts like having a colonized mind or internalized misogyny or whatever the fuck,

58
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,640
they all completely make sense. The way in which these people view the world is fundamentally

59
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,320
flawed, but within that framework, of course all this regressive nonsense would show up.

60
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,900
In fact, using this logic, if you were to show somebody like Ayanna Pressley, these

61
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,420
black women, she might actually call them white men. Of course, the political advantage

62
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,080
of this point of view is that you can basically define anybody however you like, for whatever

63
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,200
reason serves your purposes that day. For example, a school district decides Asians

64
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,360
aren't students of color. Administrators at North Thurston Public Schools, which oversees

65
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,160
some 16,000 students, have lumped Asians in with whites and measured their academic

66
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,240
achievements against students of color, a category that includes black, Latinx, Native

67
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,760
American, Pacific Islander, and multiracial students. Where's the Arabs, North Thurston?

68
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,480
Where's the Jews, you fucking racists? Where's the Indians? Oh wait, the Indians are actually

69
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,240
pretty successful. Maybe they count as white too. The meme that Asians are whites is something

70
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,000
that's reasonably widespread. I think I actually did a joking video about it a few years ago

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,440
about the alt-right's Asian fetish. It's not just the alt-right though. I know Louis Laveau

72
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,840
has been saying, the future of the white race is to mix them with Asians. I think he just

73
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,880
says he wants an Asian girlfriend, to be honest. But still, this is some weird South African

74
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,240
apartheid style shit, isn't it? We're actually at the point where woke people are giving

75
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,220
us honorary whites. What does that make Tim Pool? Tim Pool's half white, half Asian. Is

76
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,900
he a super white? Don't be obtuse. Asians definitely have privilege over every other

77
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,560
minority due to their close proximity to whiteness. It's like I said, it's intersectional bullshit.

78
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,180
The closer you are to whiteness, the more that the commies think they can just discriminate

79
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,740
against you. But what is this whiteness? What is this colonizing ideology? Let's see if

80
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:07,060
we can figure it out. White people food is creating an unobtainable picture of health.

81
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:16,220
Alright, so I got it. I got it. If you eat healthy, you're white. Okay. I thought depression

82
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:21,100
was a white people disease. A conversation with depressed while black. If you have mental

83
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:27,220
health problems, you're white. Okay, got it. Philly rapper Pop Hunna is getting blackballed

84
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:32,580
by the industry for paperwork of him cooperating with police when he was 13. His friend was

85
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,020
killed in front of him and his mom. It's becoming a debate because of his age at the time. Well,

86
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,340
it's also becoming a debate because cooperating with the police when your friend gets killed

87
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:49,340
in front of you is apparently bad like fucking fucking what this no snitch culture is, in

88
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,220
my opinion, ridiculous. Are we are we actually at the point where we're saying that, you

89
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,740
know, not being a fucking gangster is being white is that whiteness now is getting out

90
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:05,020
of the hood and being successful whiteness. Pretending you don't have feelings as a colonized

91
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:11,460
white ass reaction. My ancestors honored their emotions and so the fuck will I so having

92
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,820
discipline or reacting appropriately to a situation or being at least somewhat of a

93
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:25,300
rational person. That's whiteness. Intelligence is a white man's mythology. A phantasmal concept

94
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:32,180
a non referring turn sin catagrammatic. Alright, got it. If you're smart, you're white. I understand.

95
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,500
I understand you fucking white supremacist. But of course, we would get here eventually.

96
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:42,020
How else would you characterize the proud boys as a white supremacist group when regardless

97
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,500
of their politics, their racial makeup is actually quite diverse? Well, the Washington

98
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,580
Post tells us to understand Trump support, we must think in terms of multi racial whiteness.

99
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,580
To these people, a black person who doesn't think black, which means you know, be a lefty

100
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,740
vote Democrat, whatever has colonized thinking he has whiteness on his side, multi racial

101
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,940
whiteness. In fact, is anybody surprised that the article is written by Christina Beltran,

102
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,480
who is a very white woman. The article itself is opinion piece garbage, which you expect

103
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,520
from the Washington Post nowadays. But Christina Beltran gave a very interesting interview

104
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,640
that I think we should probably listen to. I want to read what you wrote in part for

105
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,500
voters who see the very act of acknowledging one's racial identity as itself racist, the

106
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,780
politics of multiracial whiteness reinforces their desired approach to colorblind individualism.

107
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:37,180
Can you explain what you mean? Sure. I think that one of the things that's interesting

108
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:43,500
about the politics of multicultural conservatism, for example, is that multicultural conservatism,

109
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,860
which is the kind of conservative politics of reaching out to other racial minorities

110
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:54,680
practiced by folks like Jack Kemp or George W. Bush, was an effort to recognize the specific

111
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,460
histories and backgrounds of particular racial populations, and to say that they could be

112
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,700
part of the GOP. And I think that one of the things that's interesting is that there's

113
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,880
a segment of people of color, who don't necessarily want to be recognized at all, they don't want

114
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,320
to be recognized for their racial distinctiveness, right, that for them, the very act of sort

115
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,280
of identifying them as Latino as African American, that they themselves have a certain discomfort

116
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,460
with that very logic, they want to be understood as simply Americans, outside of those kinds

117
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,300
of identity categories. I think that one of the big political divides we face right

118
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:32,640
now is people who find the very act of talking about those histories of racial exclusion

119
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,080
as divisive, because the act of talking about it and acknowledging it produces a kind of

120
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,820
defensiveness or anger, and even discussing it, the idea that unity should be practiced

121
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,660
from sort of not engaging with our history, not sort of celebrating the best stuff, and

122
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:54,100
not really acknowledging that we have a complicated, beautiful, tragic, inspiring inheritance

123
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,340
that we have to understand to go forward.

124
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:03,820
So let me get this straight. According to this person, the problem is non-white people

125
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:10,260
who don't like identity politics, and how they react when identity politics are forced

126
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:16,020
on them. We have to understand this to go forward. So if you're a non-white person who's

127
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:21,900
not idpol obsessed, to Beltran, you're a backwards regressive element. You might even

128
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,420
say a reactionary. This is some ridiculous bullshit, guys.

129
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:31,380
And is anybody surprised that, say, right-leaning people are beginning to latch onto this multiracial

130
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,460
whiteness? I mean, look at this. This guy could basically be a young Ian Miles Chong.

131
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:42,000
And of course white people are never racially discriminated against. Of course. Especially

132
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,520
if you're one of those multiracial whites, then nothing that happens to you is actually

133
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,040
discrimination. Because you've internalized all of that colonization or whatever the fuck

134
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,900
they'd say. Look at this picture, dude. Mm-hmm. The votes of black Americans should count

135
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:02,960
twice. Vote reparations would empower us to replace oppressive institutions with life-affirming

136
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:09,720
structures of equality. By Brandon Hasbrook. Look at this pale-ass Sean King motherfucker.

137
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,080
What are you, like, one-eighth black? I swear to God, my skin is darker than yours because

138
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,280
I'm half Italian.

139
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,760
Orlando Hall was executed last night. Hall was a black man convicted by an all-white

140
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,600
jury. He is the eighth person executed this year by the Trump administration. Orlando

141
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:33,080
Hall kidnapped, raped, and buried a 16-year-old girl alive. Fuck your race card. He is not

142
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,880
more innocent simply because of his skin color. But if you're an intersectionalist, you have

143
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,800
to go to bat for these people. Because that is where intersectionality takes you. Dear

144
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,180
white and Asian people, stop going to black churches to get vaccinated. These sites are

145
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:53,880
prioritizing black people. After they got dogpiled, we don't have time to educate all

146
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,720
communities on equity and the importance of the black church. To our Asian followers,

147
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,720
we don't have time to educate your community on disenfranchisement and anti-black racism.

148
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,960
We are working to promote equity on very level. A lot of racist messages have come

149
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:16,120
our way from the Asian community about our post. As a community, we are dying from COVID-19

150
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,920
and double digits with our counterparts in the Latino slash X communities. We stand by

151
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,960
what we said. Blah, blah, blah. And of course, of course violence against Asians is not a

152
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,720
hate crime because they're white, right? Of course the roof Koreans were all just oppressors

153
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,080
in the end. Of course, when black people attack Asian people randomly on the street,

154
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:44,120
they're simply punching up. Violence against Asian Americans and why the term hate crime

155
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,180
should be used carefully. Social media posts have conflated violence against people who

156
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:55,220
are Asian American with hate crimes against the community at large. That is what happens

157
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,120
whenever there is violence against somebody who is black. It's always made into a race

158
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,320
question. It's always tied into the community at large, but let's be fucking real here.

159
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:12,160
Jacob Blake was shot by police while trying to abduct children. Rayshard Brooks, regardless

160
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,700
of him being a scumbag in other areas of his life, was a danger on multiple levels from

161
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,920
driving drunk to fighting with the cops. And although George Floyd's situation was exacerbated

162
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:30,320
by admittedly terrible actions from the police officers, he still ultimately overdosed. Every

163
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,760
single time a black person dies, it becomes a community thing. It becomes a racial thing,

164
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:42,100
whether it's warranted or not. And now people have the gall to say, don't make it an Asian

165
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:48,160
thing when Asian people are targeted and attacked. They say don't use the hashtag Asian lives

166
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,800
matter because no lives matter until black lives do. At least according to the Twitterati,

167
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:02,040
sometimes Asian people are actually the victim of a race based crime, especially if it's a white

168
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,360
person who commits it. So there was a shooting I think about a week ago where a white person shot

169
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,920
and killed eight people, six of whom were Asian American. And because the shooting happened at

170
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,000
a spa, they may or may not have been sex workers. And despite the left throwing the Asians under the

171
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,360
bus this whole time, suddenly now it was all about race. It was all about people of color.

172
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,480
It was all about whiteness and white violence. And then as soon as it came out that the shooting

173
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:35,080
appeared not to be racially motivated, people were up in arms. But here's the actual truth.

174
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:42,160
Anybody can experience discrimination. This was not even considered a controversial opinion,

175
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,980
at least when I was young. The 90s and the 2000s were full of PSAs that said racism against

176
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:55,240
anybody was bad, including white people. Yes, Shakaran, they said the Irish experienced racism

177
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:02,540
because they did. Because everyone has. Every group of people on the face of this planet has

178
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:08,380
been both the oppressed and the oppressor class. And it ultimately doesn't matter. Really, it

179
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:13,860
doesn't. What matters is what people are doing today. What crimes are they committing today?

180
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:19,540
What racial othering are they committing today? What denying of culture or identity are they

181
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:25,980
committing today? And today, all of that absolutely terrible shit seems to be coming from the left.
