00:00.000 --> 00:12.520
My friends, today it is time to talk about acting white. Because it's 2021, whiteness

00:12.520 --> 00:18.160
is not simply having a skin colour, it is a way of behaviour. At least that's what the

00:18.160 --> 00:22.120
woke lefties tell me. And also the white supremacists.

00:22.120 --> 00:26.820
If you've been paying attention, you'll notice that a lot of different races are now part

00:26.820 --> 00:32.780
of the white race, or alternatively part of the black race. For example, Jason Wardell,

00:32.780 --> 00:39.460
a teacher with Mediterranean and Jewish heritage, is left bewildered as his trade union insists

00:39.460 --> 00:44.940
he is black despite telling him that he's not. Behold, a black man.

00:44.940 --> 00:50.840
Mr Wardell, who is a design technology teacher, was invited by the National Education Union

00:50.840 --> 00:57.380
to a meeting of black teachers. The NEU says it treats black as a political term rather

00:57.380 --> 01:03.780
than a signifier of African heritage. Therefore, the term includes all members who self-identify

01:03.780 --> 01:10.400
as black, Asian, and any other minority ethnic group who don't identify themselves as white.

01:10.400 --> 01:15.240
When Mr Wardell contacted the union to say that he wasn't black, the NEU informed him

01:15.240 --> 01:20.580
that since he did not consider himself white, he had to be registered as such.

01:20.580 --> 01:25.300
Jewish was an option in the religion section only, which leads me to believe that the NEU

01:25.300 --> 01:30.080
doesn't recognize Jewish as a race. I don't feel like an actual black member would necessarily

01:30.080 --> 01:35.300
want me down as a black member, and rightly so. Of course, it's definitely not just Jewish

01:35.300 --> 01:42.740
people who get forced into the false dichotomy of white or black, but it's also Arabs, Persians,

01:42.740 --> 01:47.480
and other people from the Middle East. Remember, JonTron is a white supremacist, apparently.

01:47.480 --> 01:52.820
But check out this article here, Prescriptive Racialism and Racial Exclusion, written by

01:52.820 --> 01:57.420
a man named Muhammad Ali. No, not the great one, this is somebody else.

01:57.420 --> 02:01.980
The crowd outside the auditorium was growing larger and louder. Controversy had arisen

02:01.980 --> 02:07.040
over the panel on religious extremism in the Middle East that I had organized at my university.

02:07.040 --> 02:11.240
A petition to cancel the event in the wake of the horrific New Zealand massacre had been

02:11.240 --> 02:15.680
circulated among the student body during the previous week, forcing my co-organizers and

02:15.680 --> 02:19.980
me to defend ourselves against accusations of Islamophobia. Months of work had gone into

02:19.980 --> 02:24.080
the event, and I even managed to secure funding for the speakers on the condition that the

02:24.080 --> 02:27.780
event went ahead. At that moment, it looked like I was going to fail. The Students for

02:27.780 --> 02:31.480
Democratic Society were protesting it, and they spooked the president of the College

02:31.480 --> 02:36.760
Republicans who were now considering cancelling it. Finally, one of our panelists, an imam,

02:36.760 --> 02:40.120
managed to persuade the College Republican president to go ahead. Despite the constant

02:40.120 --> 02:44.300
heckling during the speaker's remarks and the Q&A session that followed, the event did

02:44.300 --> 02:49.520
finally proceed as planned. The panel and I addressed the New Zealand atrocity and explicitly

02:49.520 --> 02:54.140
condemned white nationalism, but the protesters remained unmoved and even interrupted the

02:54.140 --> 02:57.520
moment of silence for the massacre's victims. Throughout the event, they held a banner that

02:57.520 --> 03:02.780
read You Do Not Represent Us. After the event, I overheard a protester berate one of the

03:02.780 --> 03:07.820
panelists and complain that the event had not been organized by an Arab. I interjected

03:07.820 --> 03:12.040
to inform her that I was the organizer of the event and that I am indeed an Arab. You

03:12.040 --> 03:16.280
don't count, she immediately retorted. We know your politics. I subsequently discovered

03:16.280 --> 03:20.860
this woman was the president of the Arab Student Association. I was already aware of this practice

03:20.860 --> 03:25.480
of Uncle Tomming members of minorities who challenged certain orthodoxies, but this was

03:25.480 --> 03:29.840
the first time I had experienced it firsthand. Such attitudes were evident in many of the

03:29.840 --> 03:34.200
protesters' objections to the event. Faisal Saeed Al Muttar, an Iraqi-born secular rights

03:34.200 --> 03:38.680
advocate and the only Arab on the panel, bore the brunt of these attacks. He was denounced

03:38.680 --> 03:43.000
as a puppet and a traitor for discussing the role of religion in motivating groups

03:43.000 --> 03:47.080
like ISIS in his native country. And this does seem to be an accurate description of

03:47.080 --> 03:52.000
how the intersectionalists operate when it comes to race. To use this Ayanna Pressley

03:52.000 --> 04:20.880
quote for I think, like, the sixth time on this channel.

04:20.880 --> 04:24.720
You're not black unless you think black. You're not Arab unless you think Arab. There

04:24.720 --> 04:29.240
is a large section of socialists, especially online right now, who have moved past the

04:29.240 --> 04:35.040
idea that race is simply some kind of genetic marker, but is actually a way of thinking,

04:35.040 --> 04:39.920
feeling and viewing the world. It is no longer an immutable trait, but rather it's an ideology

04:39.920 --> 04:46.040
that you adopt. This is how, after all, straight black men are the white people of black people.

04:46.040 --> 04:50.320
This is a ridiculous statement in a ridiculous headline of a ridiculous article on a ridiculous

04:50.320 --> 04:54.040
website. But this is where critical theory leads you. If the dominant culture really

04:54.040 --> 05:00.520
is whiteness, if it's the white cis-normative hetero-patriarchal capitalist whatever, then

05:00.520 --> 05:05.280
every step that you're closer to that, you're more white. And using this lens, completely

05:05.280 --> 05:12.200
stupid concepts like having a colonized mind or internalized misogyny or whatever the fuck,

05:12.200 --> 05:16.640
they all completely make sense. The way in which these people view the world is fundamentally

05:16.640 --> 05:21.320
flawed, but within that framework, of course all this regressive nonsense would show up.

05:21.320 --> 05:25.900
In fact, using this logic, if you were to show somebody like Ayanna Pressley, these

05:25.900 --> 05:30.420
black women, she might actually call them white men. Of course, the political advantage

05:30.420 --> 05:35.080
of this point of view is that you can basically define anybody however you like, for whatever

05:35.080 --> 05:39.200
reason serves your purposes that day. For example, a school district decides Asians

05:39.200 --> 05:44.360
aren't students of color. Administrators at North Thurston Public Schools, which oversees

05:44.360 --> 05:50.160
some 16,000 students, have lumped Asians in with whites and measured their academic

05:50.160 --> 05:56.240
achievements against students of color, a category that includes black, Latinx, Native

05:56.240 --> 06:01.760
American, Pacific Islander, and multiracial students. Where's the Arabs, North Thurston?

06:01.760 --> 06:06.480
Where's the Jews, you fucking racists? Where's the Indians? Oh wait, the Indians are actually

06:06.480 --> 06:10.240
pretty successful. Maybe they count as white too. The meme that Asians are whites is something

06:10.240 --> 06:16.000
that's reasonably widespread. I think I actually did a joking video about it a few years ago

06:16.000 --> 06:20.440
about the alt-right's Asian fetish. It's not just the alt-right though. I know Louis Laveau

06:20.440 --> 06:24.840
has been saying, the future of the white race is to mix them with Asians. I think he just

06:24.840 --> 06:29.880
says he wants an Asian girlfriend, to be honest. But still, this is some weird South African

06:29.880 --> 06:34.240
apartheid style shit, isn't it? We're actually at the point where woke people are giving

06:34.240 --> 06:40.220
us honorary whites. What does that make Tim Pool? Tim Pool's half white, half Asian. Is

06:40.220 --> 06:45.900
he a super white? Don't be obtuse. Asians definitely have privilege over every other

06:45.900 --> 06:51.560
minority due to their close proximity to whiteness. It's like I said, it's intersectional bullshit.

06:51.560 --> 06:56.180
The closer you are to whiteness, the more that the commies think they can just discriminate

06:56.180 --> 07:01.740
against you. But what is this whiteness? What is this colonizing ideology? Let's see if

07:01.740 --> 07:07.060
we can figure it out. White people food is creating an unobtainable picture of health.

07:07.060 --> 07:16.220
Alright, so I got it. I got it. If you eat healthy, you're white. Okay. I thought depression

07:16.220 --> 07:21.100
was a white people disease. A conversation with depressed while black. If you have mental

07:21.100 --> 07:27.220
health problems, you're white. Okay, got it. Philly rapper Pop Hunna is getting blackballed

07:27.220 --> 07:32.580
by the industry for paperwork of him cooperating with police when he was 13. His friend was

07:32.580 --> 07:37.020
killed in front of him and his mom. It's becoming a debate because of his age at the time. Well,

07:37.540 --> 07:42.340
it's also becoming a debate because cooperating with the police when your friend gets killed

07:42.340 --> 07:49.340
in front of you is apparently bad like fucking fucking what this no snitch culture is, in

07:49.340 --> 07:54.220
my opinion, ridiculous. Are we are we actually at the point where we're saying that, you

07:54.220 --> 07:59.740
know, not being a fucking gangster is being white is that whiteness now is getting out

07:59.740 --> 08:05.020
of the hood and being successful whiteness. Pretending you don't have feelings as a colonized

08:05.020 --> 08:11.460
white ass reaction. My ancestors honored their emotions and so the fuck will I so having

08:11.460 --> 08:16.820
discipline or reacting appropriately to a situation or being at least somewhat of a

08:16.820 --> 08:25.300
rational person. That's whiteness. Intelligence is a white man's mythology. A phantasmal concept

08:25.300 --> 08:32.180
a non referring turn sin catagrammatic. Alright, got it. If you're smart, you're white. I understand.

08:32.180 --> 08:36.500
I understand you fucking white supremacist. But of course, we would get here eventually.

08:36.500 --> 08:42.020
How else would you characterize the proud boys as a white supremacist group when regardless

08:42.020 --> 08:46.500
of their politics, their racial makeup is actually quite diverse? Well, the Washington

08:46.500 --> 08:52.580
Post tells us to understand Trump support, we must think in terms of multi racial whiteness.

08:52.580 --> 08:57.580
To these people, a black person who doesn't think black, which means you know, be a lefty

08:57.580 --> 09:02.740
vote Democrat, whatever has colonized thinking he has whiteness on his side, multi racial

09:02.740 --> 09:06.940
whiteness. In fact, is anybody surprised that the article is written by Christina Beltran,

09:06.940 --> 09:12.480
who is a very white woman. The article itself is opinion piece garbage, which you expect

09:12.480 --> 09:16.520
from the Washington Post nowadays. But Christina Beltran gave a very interesting interview

09:16.520 --> 09:20.640
that I think we should probably listen to. I want to read what you wrote in part for

09:20.640 --> 09:25.500
voters who see the very act of acknowledging one's racial identity as itself racist, the

09:25.500 --> 09:31.780
politics of multiracial whiteness reinforces their desired approach to colorblind individualism.

09:31.780 --> 09:37.180
Can you explain what you mean? Sure. I think that one of the things that's interesting

09:37.180 --> 09:43.500
about the politics of multicultural conservatism, for example, is that multicultural conservatism,

09:43.500 --> 09:47.860
which is the kind of conservative politics of reaching out to other racial minorities

09:47.860 --> 09:54.680
practiced by folks like Jack Kemp or George W. Bush, was an effort to recognize the specific

09:54.680 --> 09:58.460
histories and backgrounds of particular racial populations, and to say that they could be

09:58.460 --> 10:03.700
part of the GOP. And I think that one of the things that's interesting is that there's

10:03.700 --> 10:08.880
a segment of people of color, who don't necessarily want to be recognized at all, they don't want

10:08.880 --> 10:13.320
to be recognized for their racial distinctiveness, right, that for them, the very act of sort

10:13.320 --> 10:19.280
of identifying them as Latino as African American, that they themselves have a certain discomfort

10:19.280 --> 10:23.460
with that very logic, they want to be understood as simply Americans, outside of those kinds

10:23.460 --> 10:27.300
of identity categories. I think that one of the big political divides we face right

10:27.300 --> 10:32.640
now is people who find the very act of talking about those histories of racial exclusion

10:32.640 --> 10:38.080
as divisive, because the act of talking about it and acknowledging it produces a kind of

10:38.080 --> 10:42.820
defensiveness or anger, and even discussing it, the idea that unity should be practiced

10:42.820 --> 10:47.660
from sort of not engaging with our history, not sort of celebrating the best stuff, and

10:47.660 --> 10:54.100
not really acknowledging that we have a complicated, beautiful, tragic, inspiring inheritance

10:54.100 --> 10:57.340
that we have to understand to go forward.

10:57.340 --> 11:03.820
So let me get this straight. According to this person, the problem is non-white people

11:03.820 --> 11:10.260
who don't like identity politics, and how they react when identity politics are forced

11:10.260 --> 11:16.020
on them. We have to understand this to go forward. So if you're a non-white person who's

11:16.020 --> 11:21.900
not idpol obsessed, to Beltran, you're a backwards regressive element. You might even

11:21.900 --> 11:25.420
say a reactionary. This is some ridiculous bullshit, guys.

11:25.420 --> 11:31.380
And is anybody surprised that, say, right-leaning people are beginning to latch onto this multiracial

11:31.380 --> 11:36.460
whiteness? I mean, look at this. This guy could basically be a young Ian Miles Chong.

11:36.460 --> 11:42.000
And of course white people are never racially discriminated against. Of course. Especially

11:42.000 --> 11:46.520
if you're one of those multiracial whites, then nothing that happens to you is actually

11:46.520 --> 11:50.040
discrimination. Because you've internalized all of that colonization or whatever the fuck

11:50.040 --> 11:55.900
they'd say. Look at this picture, dude. Mm-hmm. The votes of black Americans should count

11:55.900 --> 12:02.960
twice. Vote reparations would empower us to replace oppressive institutions with life-affirming

12:02.960 --> 12:09.720
structures of equality. By Brandon Hasbrook. Look at this pale-ass Sean King motherfucker.

12:09.720 --> 12:14.080
What are you, like, one-eighth black? I swear to God, my skin is darker than yours because

12:14.080 --> 12:15.280
I'm half Italian.

12:15.280 --> 12:20.760
Orlando Hall was executed last night. Hall was a black man convicted by an all-white

12:20.760 --> 12:25.600
jury. He is the eighth person executed this year by the Trump administration. Orlando

12:25.600 --> 12:33.080
Hall kidnapped, raped, and buried a 16-year-old girl alive. Fuck your race card. He is not

12:33.080 --> 12:37.880
more innocent simply because of his skin color. But if you're an intersectionalist, you have

12:37.880 --> 12:42.800
to go to bat for these people. Because that is where intersectionality takes you. Dear

12:42.800 --> 12:48.180
white and Asian people, stop going to black churches to get vaccinated. These sites are

12:48.180 --> 12:53.880
prioritizing black people. After they got dogpiled, we don't have time to educate all

12:53.880 --> 12:58.720
communities on equity and the importance of the black church. To our Asian followers,

12:58.720 --> 13:03.720
we don't have time to educate your community on disenfranchisement and anti-black racism.

13:03.720 --> 13:09.960
We are working to promote equity on very level. A lot of racist messages have come

13:09.960 --> 13:16.120
our way from the Asian community about our post. As a community, we are dying from COVID-19

13:16.120 --> 13:20.920
and double digits with our counterparts in the Latino slash X communities. We stand by

13:20.920 --> 13:26.960
what we said. Blah, blah, blah. And of course, of course violence against Asians is not a

13:26.960 --> 13:32.720
hate crime because they're white, right? Of course the roof Koreans were all just oppressors

13:32.720 --> 13:38.080
in the end. Of course, when black people attack Asian people randomly on the street,

13:38.080 --> 13:44.120
they're simply punching up. Violence against Asian Americans and why the term hate crime

13:44.120 --> 13:49.180
should be used carefully. Social media posts have conflated violence against people who

13:49.180 --> 13:55.220
are Asian American with hate crimes against the community at large. That is what happens

13:55.220 --> 14:00.120
whenever there is violence against somebody who is black. It's always made into a race

14:00.120 --> 14:05.320
question. It's always tied into the community at large, but let's be fucking real here.

14:05.320 --> 14:12.160
Jacob Blake was shot by police while trying to abduct children. Rayshard Brooks, regardless

14:12.160 --> 14:17.700
of him being a scumbag in other areas of his life, was a danger on multiple levels from

14:17.700 --> 14:22.920
driving drunk to fighting with the cops. And although George Floyd's situation was exacerbated

14:22.920 --> 14:30.320
by admittedly terrible actions from the police officers, he still ultimately overdosed. Every

14:30.320 --> 14:36.760
single time a black person dies, it becomes a community thing. It becomes a racial thing,

14:36.760 --> 14:42.100
whether it's warranted or not. And now people have the gall to say, don't make it an Asian

14:42.100 --> 14:48.160
thing when Asian people are targeted and attacked. They say don't use the hashtag Asian lives

14:48.160 --> 14:53.800
matter because no lives matter until black lives do. At least according to the Twitterati,

14:53.800 --> 15:02.040
sometimes Asian people are actually the victim of a race based crime, especially if it's a white

15:02.040 --> 15:06.360
person who commits it. So there was a shooting I think about a week ago where a white person shot

15:06.360 --> 15:11.920
and killed eight people, six of whom were Asian American. And because the shooting happened at

15:11.920 --> 15:18.000
a spa, they may or may not have been sex workers. And despite the left throwing the Asians under the

15:18.000 --> 15:22.360
bus this whole time, suddenly now it was all about race. It was all about people of color.

15:22.360 --> 15:28.480
It was all about whiteness and white violence. And then as soon as it came out that the shooting

15:28.480 --> 15:35.080
appeared not to be racially motivated, people were up in arms. But here's the actual truth.

15:35.080 --> 15:42.160
Anybody can experience discrimination. This was not even considered a controversial opinion,

15:42.160 --> 15:47.980
at least when I was young. The 90s and the 2000s were full of PSAs that said racism against

15:47.980 --> 15:55.240
anybody was bad, including white people. Yes, Shakaran, they said the Irish experienced racism

15:55.240 --> 16:02.540
because they did. Because everyone has. Every group of people on the face of this planet has

16:02.540 --> 16:08.380
been both the oppressed and the oppressor class. And it ultimately doesn't matter. Really, it

16:08.380 --> 16:13.860
doesn't. What matters is what people are doing today. What crimes are they committing today?

16:13.860 --> 16:19.540
What racial othering are they committing today? What denying of culture or identity are they

16:19.540 --> 16:25.980
committing today? And today, all of that absolutely terrible shit seems to be coming from the left.

16:25.980 --> 16:31.500
