1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Blizzcon is just one week away, and things aren't looking good for our pals over at

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,760
Blizzard.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,600
Overwatch's Mei has become a symbol of Hong Kong independence.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,440
The Western Hearthstone protesters were ultimately banned after several weeks of deliberation,

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,400
because I guess they prefer to crack down harder instead of absolving Blitzchung.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,640
And Blizzard's cancelled several high-profile events, where the fans could conceivably have

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,320
had a public voice.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,800
Like the Overwatch Switch launch event at Nintendo's New York store, or the World

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,200
of Warcraft 15th anniversary event in Taiwan.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,360
But they can't cancel Blizzcon, a major 4-day event with thousands of attendees, games

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,040
to announce, expos to set up, and so on.

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,760
So the rumour on the street, at least right now, is that the legendary Blizzcon Q&A sessions

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,800
– you know, the source of so many great memes and videos, the actual reason to attend

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,280
Blizzcon or watch anything about Blizzcon online beyond just the trailers on YouTube

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,960
– those Q&A sessions are either being removed outright or tightly regulated.

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,340
Who knows what that means?

17
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,140
It might mean the lineup is filled with paid actors and planted questions.

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,480
It might mean the questions are filtered through a suggestions box, and only questions Blizzard

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,920
wants to answer will be read aloud.

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,720
It might mean the fans have to tell their question to a moderator, who then chooses

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,000
whether or not to ask it.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,740
Here's what I'd bet money on, though.

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,740
Diablo Immortal was bad enough.

24
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,900
Like this Hong Kong stuff, Blizzard is not going to allow a repeat of last year.

25
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,640
And if that means they censor their own fans, so be it.

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,220
Your average Joe will not be allowed on the mic again.

27
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,020
But hold on a minute.

28
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,740
Give that a second thought.

29
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,100
Blizzard censoring their own fans.

30
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,460
This isn't Blizzard censoring their haters.

31
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,400
This isn't Blizzard censoring casual players of their games.

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,920
Blizzcon attracts only one audience, the diehard Blizzard fan.

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,880
The one who's grown up on Blizzard games.

34
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,400
The one who is primarily invested only in Blizzard properties.

35
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,720
The one who will play anything Blizzard makes, regardless of genre or accessibility.

36
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,120
Why is the demographic that loves Blizzard the most also simultaneously the one Blizzard's

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
the most afraid of?

38
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,000
I think the answer can be found, weirdly enough, in this unrelated article from Buzzfeed.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,680
At VidCon's 10-year anniversary, influencers, fans, and brands all seem ready to leave YouTube

40
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
behind.

41
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,640
Unsurprisingly, it's about VidCon 2019 from this past summer.

42
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,520
And as VidCon has turned more and more social justice-oriented over time, it's switched

43
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,600
from a gaggle of interesting topics and panels and creators to a curated, SJW-approved propaganda

44
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
mouthpiece.

45
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,280
How dark do you want to get?

46
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,360
YouTuber Lindsay Ellis asked the moderator of one of the first panels at VidCon about

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,720
how online video communities have changed over the years.

48
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,520
It was fun, said Ellis.

49
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,180
And now it's like, okay, how do we protect ourselves from our audience?

50
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,320
Lindsay Ellis, despite her many attempts to get away from the name, is most well-known

51
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,020
as the Nostalgia Chick, a female counterpart to Channel Awesome's Nostalgia Critic.

52
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,280
Back when That Guy with the Glasses was relevant, the online video creation space was indeed

53
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,600
very different.

54
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,600
YouTube monetization didn't really exist.

55
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,800
Neither did copyright strikes or appeals.

56
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,560
Videos affected were usually just deleted.

57
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,760
BlipTV was bigger than YouTube and offered a flat, reliable, one-cent-per-view of a monetized

58
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,760
video.

59
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,080
However, Blip was only a video hosting service and lacked reliable channel pages, a front

60
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,360
page, or a search function.

61
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,840
In order to ensure people actually watched your Blip videos, you had to have a website

62
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,240
to embed them on that actually got a lot of traffic.

63
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,080
This is what led the larger creators of the time to simply post trailers or announcements

64
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,360
on their YouTube channels and link off-site to Blip in the video description.

65
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,800
The video ecosystem of the time was one where a popular creator could actually run their

66
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,080
own community directly, or in the case of TiguaTig, join a team of creators who cross-promote.

67
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,100
Lindsay Ellis as the Nostalgia Chick was one of the bigger names during the BlipTV era,

68
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,760
and that success did carry over to her YouTube channel after Blip's decline.

69
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,580
When she says it was fun, I think she's referring to the state of video creation during

70
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,580
her rise.

71
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,720
Yes, she had more direct control over her community, but frankly she was also younger,

72
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,760
more energetic, and a lot funnier.

73
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,600
But more telling is the line, how do we protect ourselves from our audience?

74
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Well, why do you need protection from your audience?

75
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,560
Your audience loves you, presumably that's why they're your audience.

76
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,680
Why do you need protection from the people that caused your success?

77
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,320
The people that watch your videos, click your ads, donate to your Patreon, buy your merch?

78
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,000
I know that there are some creators who just get hate-watched, like Dark Side Phil, but

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,640
the Nostalgia Chick was never that.

80
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,520
What happened to you, Lindsay?

81
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,400
What did you do that you require protection from your own fans?

82
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,580
The Buzzfeed article goes on to talk about panels devolving into group therapy sessions,

83
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,580
as YouTubers commiserated over shared experiences with harassment and exploitation.

84
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,880
The YouTubers people care about can't be invited because they're all out of control.

85
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,760
And the safer creators they did invite are all traumatized.

86
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,680
Keemstar, the massive influencer and vlogger behind the 5 million subscriber strong YouTube

87
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,960
gossip channel Drama Alert, spent the week around Vidkong derisively tweeting about

88
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,340
how irrelevant the conference is now.

89
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,980
When Vidkong sends its YouTubers, they're not sending their best.

90
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,540
They're sending YouTubers that have lots of dead channels.

91
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,100
They're bringing in fidget spinners.

92
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,620
They're bringing in hoverboards.

93
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,620
They're randoms.

94
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,900
I know that the media likes to demonize fans.

95
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,220
They like to say their ire is irrational.

96
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,940
They're entitled, as we've seen them call gamers time and again.

97
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,700
They're dangerous, as Lindsay Ellis likes to imply.

98
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,140
I'm sure somebody inside Blizzard right now is calling them fickle.

99
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,060
Maybe on some level, at some point in time, all of these criticisms might be true.

100
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,220
You know what's way more relevant, though?

101
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:36,080
Anyone who's ever had their entire fanbase turn on them has been perceived by that fanbase

102
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,500
to have behaved so badly that a variation of the consumer revolt, a fandom's revolt

103
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,180
maybe, was in order.

104
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,240
Sometimes it's undeserved.

105
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,720
With ProJared, for example, it was probably not warranted.

106
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,500
But I think fans understand this when they see it, because when ProJared vindicated himself,

107
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,920
the people returned.

108
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,320
Mob rule is slow to start, hard to stop, and grossly unjust.

109
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,720
Fan rule, however, is different.

110
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,600
Fans will give the object of their fandom the benefit of the doubt.

111
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,480
They'll be more likely to forgive transgressions if the conversation is honest.

112
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,800
But also, if all of this goodwill is abused?

113
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,920
Yeah, they'll turn on you.

114
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,600
This is what Lindsay Ellis and all of those other traumatized YouTubers are noticing when

115
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
they talk about having to keep safe from their fans.

116
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,280
I obviously don't endorse the illegal actions of people's fans, but at some point, you

117
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,560
have to look at your own conduct and wonder how you managed to screw up having half a

118
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,320
million people who loved you.

119
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,760
I've been making videos for just as long as Lindsay, and I've never had cause to

120
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,820
fear my fans.

121
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,360
Lindsay Ellis gave a talk on this at XOXO Fest just a couple weeks ago, and holy shit,

122
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,360
is that actually her?

123
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,680
This doesn't look like a woman of 34.

124
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,840
She looks like a 49-year-old failed small-town English teacher.

125
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,600
Like, I know she's 22 in her older videos, and part of the change is just age, it happens

126
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,720
to the best of us.

127
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
It's happened to me.

128
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,400
But man, that's no excuse to let yourself go.

129
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,480
Anyway, listen to her talk about this.

130
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:03,200
Content warning, there's gonna be some Nazis, but you know, that's just the internet now.

131
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
It's great.

132
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
What a time to be alive.

133
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
I love it.

134
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:14,800
A friend of mine became the in-thor-so person sliding into my DMs like, hey, there's an

135
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,880
alt-right mob after me.

136
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,560
You know what this is like.

137
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,360
What do I do?

138
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,640
And I kind of had a moment where I'm like, wow, this keeps happening, where people ask

139
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:31,680
me advice on how to deal with bad faith hate mobs, that kind of had become an expert in

140
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,840
surviving that sort of thing, because it has happened to me many, many times over the years.

141
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,520
It was humiliating, because you had to have all of these people going back and forth being

142
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,240
like, hmm, this seems an awful lot like the thing that happened to Sarah Zhang at the

143
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,040
New York Times last month.

144
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,920
We had to collate all these tweets, we had to mine everything and be absolutely clear

145
00:07:52,920 --> 00:08:00,680
on who said what and when and what the threat was, and it was very awful.

146
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:07,440
It harmed my relationships, it harmed my marriage, it cost me a lot of productivity and several

147
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,040
friendships, and eventually, I actually ended up at an institution, because everything was

148
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,040
just crumbling and I did not know how to deal with this.

149
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:24,280
Even if you're not in sort of like a literal physical war zone, is being afraid messes

150
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:32,360
with your brain chemistry, and then you start having the same responses that you would have

151
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,560
if you had been in sort of a physical danger, like you become jumpy, you become irritable,

152
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,000
you become more depressed.

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,600
These people are feeling empowered enough in their own racism that they thought, yeah,

154
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,120
they'd be like, oh, wow, yeah, anti-white racism is a thing, we should probably fire

155
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,120
this person.

156
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,680
There's good faith criticism, and that's true, but to me, it turns into bad faith when people

157
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,920
start using you as a proxy in whatever culture war thing is going on.

158
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,440
How do you deal with it?

159
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,920
I've become an expert.

160
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,480
I don't know if I've become an expert on dealing with it well, but you have to cope, or you

161
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,120
die, because nothing on the internet dies.

162
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,320
What happens is, these people, there's always going to be a subset of people who will see

163
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
you existing.

164
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,040
Maybe they'll see you interacting with another Twitter person, and they just kind of take

165
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,680
it upon themselves to slide into the mentions of whoever is interacting with you and being

166
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,400
like, she's an anti-white racist.

167
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,860
I'm sorry, it's funny.

168
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:38,880
People still are kind of like, you kind of deserve it, maybe.

169
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,140
Maybe there was something you could have done to present it, you know?

170
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:48,320
And it's just, people can't really help but do the victim-blaming thing.

171
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,040
It also harms your relationship with your audience.

172
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,600
You don't want to make content anymore.

173
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,780
You don't trust people, and it's hard to make content for people when you think that half

174
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,360
of them want you to die.

175
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,760
This is a conversation between Hank Green, Carlos Maza, and me.

176
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
Let's unpack this.

177
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,400
Do you guys know who Carlos Maza is?

178
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Yes.

179
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Support Carlos Maza.

180
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,200
So Carlos Maza is another YouTuber.

181
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,400
He and I were like Twitter buds.

182
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,200
We hadn't really met before the Crowdering happened.

183
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:28,000
But basically, he had been abused and bullied by another much bigger YouTuber named Steven

184
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,200
Crowder for years.

185
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,880
Like a lot of homophobic slurs, a lot of racist slurs.

186
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,960
And one day, Carlos decided, I'm just going to chronicle this.

187
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
I'm going to stand up for myself.

188
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,440
And yep, sure did.

189
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,360
So you can guess what happened after that.

190
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,040
Crowder mobilized his army and is continuing to.

191
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,860
This is still happening.

192
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,120
And then you had the exact same thinking happen with Carlos.

193
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:02,440
If he responds to, in this case, Hank, who is being supportive, sorry for the people

194
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:09,920
that are harassing me, and now they are invited into your space, and then it's, you know,

195
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,200
everybody's scattered before they see us.

196
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,920
This is the punishment for daring to interact with your colleagues in a public forum.

197
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,840
Carlos was an example where he would kind of like collate and seek out the abuse and

198
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,080
actually highlight it.

199
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:30,320
And I was like, no, you have to stop doing that because you're re-traumatizing yourself.

200
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,900
You're very good at actually making the trauma you already have worse because they speak

201
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,200
the language of abuse.

202
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,040
I basically have like my Twitter completely, you know, cloistered down.

203
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,660
Get into all of those advanced options, mute everything.

204
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,960
And honestly, that's been a lot healthier ever since I've done that.

205
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,200
Even since like the, you know, the nonsense of last year died down.

206
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,040
There's just such a huge volume of people at you, positive and negative.

207
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,520
And obviously, like, I, you know, it's obviously, but I get a lot of threats.

208
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,240
So we have basically like an inbox for it.

209
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,840
I have someone that handles my YouTube comments for me.

210
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,540
I don't look at them anymore.

211
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,560
And I don't really look at my Twitter mentions anymore.

212
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,120
You should not subject yourself to people abusing you.

213
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,480
You know, it becomes a form of digital self-harm.

214
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,880
And that only makes things worse.

215
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,300
There's an arrogance behind her voice here.

216
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,280
There's this idea that the internet just comes for people irrationally with no rhyme

217
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,060
or reason behind it.

218
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,580
Lindsay Ellis didn't do anything.

219
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,380
Carlos Mazza didn't do anything.

220
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,520
These poor content creators, these innocent journalists have never done a single thing

221
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,180
wrong in their entire lives.

222
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,460
And the implication is that their fame is simply a heavy burden to bear, a price to

223
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,280
pay to be in their industry because everyone who follows them sucks.

224
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,240
You can hear in her voice the extreme disdain for the people who even put her on that stage.

225
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,240
Here Lindsay, let me frame this in a way that an intersectionalist like you would understand.

226
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,480
To those who have had privilege all of their lives, criticism probably feels like oppression

227
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,880
and harassment.

228
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,320
You have the fame, the audience, you're on the stage.

229
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,080
You have the TV show, the 500,000 sub channel, you have the brand, you have the privilege.

230
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,960
Your viewers make up a class of people who don't have that privilege.

231
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,220
And if those viewers are vocal about their problems with you, I'm not surprised that

232
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,220
you felt so harassed and traumatized that you've had to give several speeches on the

233
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,220
topic now.

234
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,380
It's probably mentally scarring to have people you look down upon tell you that you're wrong.

235
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,180
Also as a side note, check out how hard she tries to avoid talking about that guy with

236
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,180
the glasses.

237
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,640
This has happened to me a lot over the years.

238
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,980
And every time, especially like as I used to work for this website that I won't name,

239
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:46,700
but when I worked for this website and there would be like a flood of this sort of thing,

240
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:53,300
the people who ran the website would either be to laugh about it, blame you for it, or

241
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,780
ignore it altogether.

242
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,500
Sorry Lindsay, but your biggest claim to fame is always going to be being Doug Walker's

243
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
Mrs. Pac-Man.

244
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,820
And speaking of gender swapped characters, you know how Anita Sarkeesian's huge channel

245
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,620
is largely dead now with comments and voting turned off?

246
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,260
Find anyone who was big 5-10 years ago that has since turned into a social justice nutjob

247
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,660
and you'll discover the exact same thing.

248
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,660
It's off.

249
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,660
Voting disabled.

250
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,580
Creator isolation and a lack of community engagement, constant whining in videos or

251
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:25,100
on social media about how the internet sucks and their viewers are all bigots.

252
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,220
No.

253
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,220
You just changed.

254
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,780
That's the long and short of it.

255
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,220
You were 18, you were 20, 22.

256
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,100
You made content with edgy jokes and witty critiques.

257
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,680
You resonated with people because you were still a member of the community.

258
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,560
But as you isolated yourself in your tower of privilege, as your old jokes and the people

259
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,940
who still like them became problematic.

260
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:49,400
As every new bit of content you put out began to revolve around Orange Man Bad or how everything

261
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,060
is oppressive, your fans felt betrayed.

262
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,360
And when they complained, you treated your own fanbase as your enemy, as a toxic abuser

263
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,060
you had to escape from.

264
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,580
What did you expect to happen?

265
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,060
This is what Blizzard's scrambling to repress right now.

266
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,460
Not strictly in a social justice sense like Lindsay Ellis or the others, but certainly

267
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,740
in the sense that they've betrayed their founding principles.

268
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,980
And every move they make only fuels the fire.

269
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,860
There's no honest conversation between Blizzard and the fans anymore.

270
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,260
The benefit of the doubt is gone.

271
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,620
The Goodwill's been abused one time too many.

272
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,220
And they'll probably reap what they've sown at Blizzcon.

273
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,140
Fans aren't inherently evil harassing mobs on the internet or whatever.

274
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,100
When you boil it down, fans just want creators to keep creating.

275
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,900
If there's a revolt, then there's a pretty good chance the creator has behaved so inappropriately

276
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,700
that fans would rather burn the whole thing down than keep getting whatever schlop the

277
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,900
creator's putting out.

278
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,100
We've seen this with Blizzard, with has-been YouTubers, with verified nobodies and Twitter

279
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,420
SJWs, with journalists and outlets.

280
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,100
They've all suffered backlash for their bad behavior.

281
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,300
They've all framed it as inappropriate, as harassment, or as oppression.

282
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:58,060
And they're all going the way of the dinosaur.
