WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
Blizzcon is just one week away, and things aren't looking good for our pals over at

00:04.760 --> 00:05.760
Blizzard.

00:05.760 --> 00:08.600
Overwatch's Mei has become a symbol of Hong Kong independence.

00:08.600 --> 00:13.440
The Western Hearthstone protesters were ultimately banned after several weeks of deliberation,

00:13.440 --> 00:17.400
because I guess they prefer to crack down harder instead of absolving Blitzchung.

00:17.400 --> 00:21.640
And Blizzard's cancelled several high-profile events, where the fans could conceivably have

00:21.640 --> 00:23.320
had a public voice.

00:23.320 --> 00:27.800
Like the Overwatch Switch launch event at Nintendo's New York store, or the World

00:27.800 --> 00:31.200
of Warcraft 15th anniversary event in Taiwan.

00:31.200 --> 00:36.360
But they can't cancel Blizzcon, a major 4-day event with thousands of attendees, games

00:36.360 --> 00:39.040
to announce, expos to set up, and so on.

00:39.040 --> 00:43.760
So the rumour on the street, at least right now, is that the legendary Blizzcon Q&A sessions

00:43.760 --> 00:48.800
– you know, the source of so many great memes and videos, the actual reason to attend

00:48.800 --> 00:54.280
Blizzcon or watch anything about Blizzcon online beyond just the trailers on YouTube

00:54.280 --> 00:59.960
– those Q&A sessions are either being removed outright or tightly regulated.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.340
Who knows what that means?

01:01.340 --> 01:05.140
It might mean the lineup is filled with paid actors and planted questions.

01:05.140 --> 01:09.480
It might mean the questions are filtered through a suggestions box, and only questions Blizzard

01:09.480 --> 01:11.920
wants to answer will be read aloud.

01:11.920 --> 01:15.720
It might mean the fans have to tell their question to a moderator, who then chooses

01:15.720 --> 01:17.000
whether or not to ask it.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.740
Here's what I'd bet money on, though.

01:19.740 --> 01:21.740
Diablo Immortal was bad enough.

01:21.740 --> 01:25.900
Like this Hong Kong stuff, Blizzard is not going to allow a repeat of last year.

01:25.900 --> 01:29.640
And if that means they censor their own fans, so be it.

01:29.640 --> 01:32.220
Your average Joe will not be allowed on the mic again.

01:32.220 --> 01:34.020
But hold on a minute.

01:34.020 --> 01:35.740
Give that a second thought.

01:35.740 --> 01:38.100
Blizzard censoring their own fans.

01:38.100 --> 01:40.460
This isn't Blizzard censoring their haters.

01:40.460 --> 01:44.400
This isn't Blizzard censoring casual players of their games.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.920
Blizzcon attracts only one audience, the diehard Blizzard fan.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.880
The one who's grown up on Blizzard games.

01:49.880 --> 01:53.400
The one who is primarily invested only in Blizzard properties.

01:53.400 --> 01:57.720
The one who will play anything Blizzard makes, regardless of genre or accessibility.

01:57.720 --> 02:02.120
Why is the demographic that loves Blizzard the most also simultaneously the one Blizzard's

02:02.120 --> 02:03.120
the most afraid of?

02:03.120 --> 02:09.000
I think the answer can be found, weirdly enough, in this unrelated article from Buzzfeed.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.680
At VidCon's 10-year anniversary, influencers, fans, and brands all seem ready to leave YouTube

02:14.680 --> 02:15.680
behind.

02:15.880 --> 02:19.640
Unsurprisingly, it's about VidCon 2019 from this past summer.

02:19.640 --> 02:24.520
And as VidCon has turned more and more social justice-oriented over time, it's switched

02:24.520 --> 02:30.600
from a gaggle of interesting topics and panels and creators to a curated, SJW-approved propaganda

02:30.600 --> 02:31.600
mouthpiece.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.280
How dark do you want to get?

02:33.280 --> 02:37.360
YouTuber Lindsay Ellis asked the moderator of one of the first panels at VidCon about

02:37.360 --> 02:40.720
how online video communities have changed over the years.

02:40.720 --> 02:42.520
It was fun, said Ellis.

02:42.520 --> 02:46.180
And now it's like, okay, how do we protect ourselves from our audience?

02:46.180 --> 02:50.320
Lindsay Ellis, despite her many attempts to get away from the name, is most well-known

02:50.320 --> 02:55.020
as the Nostalgia Chick, a female counterpart to Channel Awesome's Nostalgia Critic.

02:55.020 --> 02:59.280
Back when That Guy with the Glasses was relevant, the online video creation space was indeed

02:59.280 --> 03:00.600
very different.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.600
YouTube monetization didn't really exist.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.800
Neither did copyright strikes or appeals.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.560
Videos affected were usually just deleted.

03:06.560 --> 03:12.760
BlipTV was bigger than YouTube and offered a flat, reliable, one-cent-per-view of a monetized

03:12.760 --> 03:13.760
video.

03:13.760 --> 03:18.080
However, Blip was only a video hosting service and lacked reliable channel pages, a front

03:18.080 --> 03:19.360
page, or a search function.

03:19.360 --> 03:23.840
In order to ensure people actually watched your Blip videos, you had to have a website

03:23.840 --> 03:26.240
to embed them on that actually got a lot of traffic.

03:26.240 --> 03:30.080
This is what led the larger creators of the time to simply post trailers or announcements

03:30.080 --> 03:34.360
on their YouTube channels and link off-site to Blip in the video description.

03:34.360 --> 03:38.800
The video ecosystem of the time was one where a popular creator could actually run their

03:38.800 --> 03:44.080
own community directly, or in the case of TiguaTig, join a team of creators who cross-promote.

03:44.080 --> 03:49.100
Lindsay Ellis as the Nostalgia Chick was one of the bigger names during the BlipTV era,

03:49.100 --> 03:52.760
and that success did carry over to her YouTube channel after Blip's decline.

03:52.760 --> 03:56.580
When she says it was fun, I think she's referring to the state of video creation during

03:56.580 --> 03:57.580
her rise.

03:57.580 --> 04:02.720
Yes, she had more direct control over her community, but frankly she was also younger,

04:02.720 --> 04:04.760
more energetic, and a lot funnier.

04:04.760 --> 04:08.600
But more telling is the line, how do we protect ourselves from our audience?

04:08.600 --> 04:11.600
Well, why do you need protection from your audience?

04:11.600 --> 04:14.560
Your audience loves you, presumably that's why they're your audience.

04:14.560 --> 04:17.680
Why do you need protection from the people that caused your success?

04:17.680 --> 04:22.320
The people that watch your videos, click your ads, donate to your Patreon, buy your merch?

04:22.320 --> 04:27.000
I know that there are some creators who just get hate-watched, like Dark Side Phil, but

04:27.000 --> 04:28.640
the Nostalgia Chick was never that.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.520
What happened to you, Lindsay?

04:30.520 --> 04:33.400
What did you do that you require protection from your own fans?

04:33.400 --> 04:37.580
The Buzzfeed article goes on to talk about panels devolving into group therapy sessions,

04:37.580 --> 04:41.580
as YouTubers commiserated over shared experiences with harassment and exploitation.

04:41.580 --> 04:45.880
The YouTubers people care about can't be invited because they're all out of control.

04:45.880 --> 04:48.760
And the safer creators they did invite are all traumatized.

04:48.760 --> 04:53.680
Keemstar, the massive influencer and vlogger behind the 5 million subscriber strong YouTube

04:53.680 --> 04:57.960
gossip channel Drama Alert, spent the week around Vidkong derisively tweeting about

04:57.960 --> 05:00.340
how irrelevant the conference is now.

05:00.340 --> 05:02.980
When Vidkong sends its YouTubers, they're not sending their best.

05:02.980 --> 05:05.540
They're sending YouTubers that have lots of dead channels.

05:05.540 --> 05:07.100
They're bringing in fidget spinners.

05:07.100 --> 05:08.620
They're bringing in hoverboards.

05:08.620 --> 05:09.620
They're randoms.

05:09.620 --> 05:11.900
I know that the media likes to demonize fans.

05:11.900 --> 05:14.220
They like to say their ire is irrational.

05:14.220 --> 05:17.940
They're entitled, as we've seen them call gamers time and again.

05:17.940 --> 05:20.700
They're dangerous, as Lindsay Ellis likes to imply.

05:20.700 --> 05:24.140
I'm sure somebody inside Blizzard right now is calling them fickle.

05:24.140 --> 05:28.060
Maybe on some level, at some point in time, all of these criticisms might be true.

05:28.060 --> 05:30.220
You know what's way more relevant, though?

05:30.220 --> 05:36.080
Anyone who's ever had their entire fanbase turn on them has been perceived by that fanbase

05:36.080 --> 05:41.500
to have behaved so badly that a variation of the consumer revolt, a fandom's revolt

05:41.500 --> 05:44.180
maybe, was in order.

05:44.180 --> 05:45.240
Sometimes it's undeserved.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.720
With ProJared, for example, it was probably not warranted.

05:47.720 --> 05:52.500
But I think fans understand this when they see it, because when ProJared vindicated himself,

05:52.500 --> 05:53.920
the people returned.

05:53.920 --> 05:58.320
Mob rule is slow to start, hard to stop, and grossly unjust.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.720
Fan rule, however, is different.

06:00.720 --> 06:03.600
Fans will give the object of their fandom the benefit of the doubt.

06:03.600 --> 06:07.480
They'll be more likely to forgive transgressions if the conversation is honest.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.800
But also, if all of this goodwill is abused?

06:09.800 --> 06:11.920
Yeah, they'll turn on you.

06:11.920 --> 06:16.600
This is what Lindsay Ellis and all of those other traumatized YouTubers are noticing when

06:16.600 --> 06:18.600
they talk about having to keep safe from their fans.

06:18.600 --> 06:23.280
I obviously don't endorse the illegal actions of people's fans, but at some point, you

06:23.280 --> 06:27.560
have to look at your own conduct and wonder how you managed to screw up having half a

06:27.600 --> 06:29.320
million people who loved you.

06:29.320 --> 06:32.760
I've been making videos for just as long as Lindsay, and I've never had cause to

06:32.760 --> 06:33.820
fear my fans.

06:33.820 --> 06:38.360
Lindsay Ellis gave a talk on this at XOXO Fest just a couple weeks ago, and holy shit,

06:38.360 --> 06:39.360
is that actually her?

06:39.360 --> 06:41.680
This doesn't look like a woman of 34.

06:41.680 --> 06:44.840
She looks like a 49-year-old failed small-town English teacher.

06:44.840 --> 06:49.600
Like, I know she's 22 in her older videos, and part of the change is just age, it happens

06:49.600 --> 06:50.720
to the best of us.

06:50.720 --> 06:51.720
It's happened to me.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.400
But man, that's no excuse to let yourself go.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.480
Anyway, listen to her talk about this.

06:56.880 --> 07:03.200
Content warning, there's gonna be some Nazis, but you know, that's just the internet now.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.200
It's great.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.200
What a time to be alive.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.200
I love it.

07:06.200 --> 07:14.800
A friend of mine became the in-thor-so person sliding into my DMs like, hey, there's an

07:14.800 --> 07:16.880
alt-right mob after me.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.560
You know what this is like.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.360
What do I do?

07:20.360 --> 07:25.640
And I kind of had a moment where I'm like, wow, this keeps happening, where people ask

07:25.640 --> 07:31.680
me advice on how to deal with bad faith hate mobs, that kind of had become an expert in

07:31.680 --> 07:36.840
surviving that sort of thing, because it has happened to me many, many times over the years.

07:36.840 --> 07:42.520
It was humiliating, because you had to have all of these people going back and forth being

07:42.520 --> 07:46.240
like, hmm, this seems an awful lot like the thing that happened to Sarah Zhang at the

07:46.240 --> 07:48.040
New York Times last month.

07:48.040 --> 07:52.920
We had to collate all these tweets, we had to mine everything and be absolutely clear

07:52.920 --> 08:00.680
on who said what and when and what the threat was, and it was very awful.

08:00.680 --> 08:07.440
It harmed my relationships, it harmed my marriage, it cost me a lot of productivity and several

08:07.440 --> 08:13.040
friendships, and eventually, I actually ended up at an institution, because everything was

08:13.040 --> 08:17.040
just crumbling and I did not know how to deal with this.

08:17.040 --> 08:24.280
Even if you're not in sort of like a literal physical war zone, is being afraid messes

08:24.280 --> 08:32.360
with your brain chemistry, and then you start having the same responses that you would have

08:32.360 --> 08:37.560
if you had been in sort of a physical danger, like you become jumpy, you become irritable,

08:37.560 --> 08:39.000
you become more depressed.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.600
These people are feeling empowered enough in their own racism that they thought, yeah,

08:43.600 --> 08:49.120
they'd be like, oh, wow, yeah, anti-white racism is a thing, we should probably fire

08:49.120 --> 08:50.120
this person.

08:50.120 --> 08:54.680
There's good faith criticism, and that's true, but to me, it turns into bad faith when people

08:54.680 --> 08:59.920
start using you as a proxy in whatever culture war thing is going on.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.440
How do you deal with it?

09:01.440 --> 09:02.920
I've become an expert.

09:02.920 --> 09:08.480
I don't know if I've become an expert on dealing with it well, but you have to cope, or you

09:08.480 --> 09:11.120
die, because nothing on the internet dies.

09:11.120 --> 09:17.320
What happens is, these people, there's always going to be a subset of people who will see

09:17.320 --> 09:18.320
you existing.

09:18.320 --> 09:22.040
Maybe they'll see you interacting with another Twitter person, and they just kind of take

09:22.040 --> 09:26.680
it upon themselves to slide into the mentions of whoever is interacting with you and being

09:26.680 --> 09:29.400
like, she's an anti-white racist.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.860
I'm sorry, it's funny.

09:32.860 --> 09:38.880
People still are kind of like, you kind of deserve it, maybe.

09:38.880 --> 09:42.140
Maybe there was something you could have done to present it, you know?

09:42.140 --> 09:48.320
And it's just, people can't really help but do the victim-blaming thing.

09:48.320 --> 09:51.040
It also harms your relationship with your audience.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.600
You don't want to make content anymore.

09:53.600 --> 09:57.780
You don't trust people, and it's hard to make content for people when you think that half

09:57.780 --> 09:59.360
of them want you to die.

09:59.360 --> 10:05.760
This is a conversation between Hank Green, Carlos Maza, and me.

10:05.760 --> 10:06.760
Let's unpack this.

10:06.760 --> 10:10.400
Do you guys know who Carlos Maza is?

10:10.400 --> 10:11.400
Yes.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.400
Support Carlos Maza.

10:13.400 --> 10:16.200
So Carlos Maza is another YouTuber.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.400
He and I were like Twitter buds.

10:18.400 --> 10:22.200
We hadn't really met before the Crowdering happened.

10:22.200 --> 10:28.000
But basically, he had been abused and bullied by another much bigger YouTuber named Steven

10:28.000 --> 10:30.200
Crowder for years.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.880
Like a lot of homophobic slurs, a lot of racist slurs.

10:32.880 --> 10:36.960
And one day, Carlos decided, I'm just going to chronicle this.

10:36.960 --> 10:38.960
I'm going to stand up for myself.

10:38.960 --> 10:43.440
And yep, sure did.

10:43.440 --> 10:46.360
So you can guess what happened after that.

10:46.360 --> 10:49.040
Crowder mobilized his army and is continuing to.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.860
This is still happening.

10:51.860 --> 10:55.120
And then you had the exact same thinking happen with Carlos.

10:55.120 --> 11:02.440
If he responds to, in this case, Hank, who is being supportive, sorry for the people

11:02.440 --> 11:09.920
that are harassing me, and now they are invited into your space, and then it's, you know,

11:09.920 --> 11:12.200
everybody's scattered before they see us.

11:12.200 --> 11:16.920
This is the punishment for daring to interact with your colleagues in a public forum.

11:16.920 --> 11:21.840
Carlos was an example where he would kind of like collate and seek out the abuse and

11:21.840 --> 11:24.080
actually highlight it.

11:24.080 --> 11:30.320
And I was like, no, you have to stop doing that because you're re-traumatizing yourself.

11:30.320 --> 11:35.900
You're very good at actually making the trauma you already have worse because they speak

11:35.900 --> 11:37.200
the language of abuse.

11:37.200 --> 11:41.040
I basically have like my Twitter completely, you know, cloistered down.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.660
Get into all of those advanced options, mute everything.

11:43.660 --> 11:46.960
And honestly, that's been a lot healthier ever since I've done that.

11:46.960 --> 11:52.200
Even since like the, you know, the nonsense of last year died down.

11:52.200 --> 11:57.040
There's just such a huge volume of people at you, positive and negative.

11:57.040 --> 12:01.520
And obviously, like, I, you know, it's obviously, but I get a lot of threats.

12:01.520 --> 12:06.240
So we have basically like an inbox for it.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.840
I have someone that handles my YouTube comments for me.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.540
I don't look at them anymore.

12:11.540 --> 12:13.560
And I don't really look at my Twitter mentions anymore.

12:13.560 --> 12:17.120
You should not subject yourself to people abusing you.

12:17.120 --> 12:20.480
You know, it becomes a form of digital self-harm.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.880
And that only makes things worse.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.300
There's an arrogance behind her voice here.

12:25.300 --> 12:29.280
There's this idea that the internet just comes for people irrationally with no rhyme

12:29.280 --> 12:31.060
or reason behind it.

12:31.060 --> 12:32.580
Lindsay Ellis didn't do anything.

12:32.580 --> 12:34.380
Carlos Mazza didn't do anything.

12:34.380 --> 12:38.520
These poor content creators, these innocent journalists have never done a single thing

12:38.520 --> 12:40.180
wrong in their entire lives.

12:40.180 --> 12:44.460
And the implication is that their fame is simply a heavy burden to bear, a price to

12:44.460 --> 12:48.280
pay to be in their industry because everyone who follows them sucks.

12:48.280 --> 12:53.240
You can hear in her voice the extreme disdain for the people who even put her on that stage.

12:53.240 --> 12:58.240
Here Lindsay, let me frame this in a way that an intersectionalist like you would understand.

12:58.240 --> 13:02.480
To those who have had privilege all of their lives, criticism probably feels like oppression

13:02.480 --> 13:03.880
and harassment.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.320
You have the fame, the audience, you're on the stage.

13:06.320 --> 13:12.080
You have the TV show, the 500,000 sub channel, you have the brand, you have the privilege.

13:12.080 --> 13:14.960
Your viewers make up a class of people who don't have that privilege.

13:14.960 --> 13:19.220
And if those viewers are vocal about their problems with you, I'm not surprised that

13:19.220 --> 13:23.220
you felt so harassed and traumatized that you've had to give several speeches on the

13:23.220 --> 13:24.220
topic now.

13:24.220 --> 13:28.380
It's probably mentally scarring to have people you look down upon tell you that you're wrong.

13:28.380 --> 13:31.180
Also as a side note, check out how hard she tries to avoid talking about that guy with

13:31.180 --> 13:32.180
the glasses.

13:32.180 --> 13:35.640
This has happened to me a lot over the years.

13:35.640 --> 13:40.980
And every time, especially like as I used to work for this website that I won't name,

13:40.980 --> 13:46.700
but when I worked for this website and there would be like a flood of this sort of thing,

13:46.700 --> 13:53.300
the people who ran the website would either be to laugh about it, blame you for it, or

13:53.300 --> 13:54.780
ignore it altogether.

13:54.780 --> 13:58.500
Sorry Lindsay, but your biggest claim to fame is always going to be being Doug Walker's

13:58.500 --> 13:59.500
Mrs. Pac-Man.

13:59.500 --> 14:03.820
And speaking of gender swapped characters, you know how Anita Sarkeesian's huge channel

14:03.820 --> 14:07.620
is largely dead now with comments and voting turned off?

14:07.620 --> 14:12.260
Find anyone who was big 5-10 years ago that has since turned into a social justice nutjob

14:12.260 --> 14:14.660
and you'll discover the exact same thing.

14:14.660 --> 14:15.660
It's off.

14:15.660 --> 14:16.660
Voting disabled.

14:16.660 --> 14:20.580
Creator isolation and a lack of community engagement, constant whining in videos or

14:20.580 --> 14:25.100
on social media about how the internet sucks and their viewers are all bigots.

14:25.100 --> 14:26.220
No.

14:26.220 --> 14:27.220
You just changed.

14:27.220 --> 14:28.780
That's the long and short of it.

14:28.780 --> 14:31.220
You were 18, you were 20, 22.

14:31.220 --> 14:34.100
You made content with edgy jokes and witty critiques.

14:34.100 --> 14:37.680
You resonated with people because you were still a member of the community.

14:37.680 --> 14:41.560
But as you isolated yourself in your tower of privilege, as your old jokes and the people

14:41.560 --> 14:43.940
who still like them became problematic.

14:43.940 --> 14:49.400
As every new bit of content you put out began to revolve around Orange Man Bad or how everything

14:49.400 --> 14:52.060
is oppressive, your fans felt betrayed.

14:52.060 --> 14:56.360
And when they complained, you treated your own fanbase as your enemy, as a toxic abuser

14:56.360 --> 14:58.060
you had to escape from.

14:58.060 --> 14:59.580
What did you expect to happen?

14:59.580 --> 15:02.060
This is what Blizzard's scrambling to repress right now.

15:02.060 --> 15:05.460
Not strictly in a social justice sense like Lindsay Ellis or the others, but certainly

15:05.460 --> 15:07.740
in the sense that they've betrayed their founding principles.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.980
And every move they make only fuels the fire.

15:09.980 --> 15:12.860
There's no honest conversation between Blizzard and the fans anymore.

15:12.860 --> 15:14.260
The benefit of the doubt is gone.

15:14.260 --> 15:16.620
The Goodwill's been abused one time too many.

15:16.620 --> 15:19.220
And they'll probably reap what they've sown at Blizzcon.

15:19.220 --> 15:23.140
Fans aren't inherently evil harassing mobs on the internet or whatever.

15:23.140 --> 15:27.100
When you boil it down, fans just want creators to keep creating.

15:27.100 --> 15:31.900
If there's a revolt, then there's a pretty good chance the creator has behaved so inappropriately

15:31.900 --> 15:35.700
that fans would rather burn the whole thing down than keep getting whatever schlop the

15:35.700 --> 15:36.900
creator's putting out.

15:36.900 --> 15:41.100
We've seen this with Blizzard, with has-been YouTubers, with verified nobodies and Twitter

15:41.100 --> 15:44.420
SJWs, with journalists and outlets.

15:44.420 --> 15:47.100
They've all suffered backlash for their bad behavior.

15:47.100 --> 15:51.300
They've all framed it as inappropriate, as harassment, or as oppression.

15:51.300 --> 15:58.060
And they're all going the way of the dinosaur.
