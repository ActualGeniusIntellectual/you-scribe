0	4760	Blizzcon is just one week away, and things aren't looking good for our pals over at
4760	5760	Blizzard.
5760	8600	Overwatch's Mei has become a symbol of Hong Kong independence.
8600	13440	The Western Hearthstone protesters were ultimately banned after several weeks of deliberation,
13440	17400	because I guess they prefer to crack down harder instead of absolving Blitzchung.
17400	21640	And Blizzard's cancelled several high-profile events, where the fans could conceivably have
21640	23320	had a public voice.
23320	27800	Like the Overwatch Switch launch event at Nintendo's New York store, or the World
27800	31200	of Warcraft 15th anniversary event in Taiwan.
31200	36360	But they can't cancel Blizzcon, a major 4-day event with thousands of attendees, games
36360	39040	to announce, expos to set up, and so on.
39040	43760	So the rumour on the street, at least right now, is that the legendary Blizzcon Q&A sessions
43760	48800	– you know, the source of so many great memes and videos, the actual reason to attend
48800	54280	Blizzcon or watch anything about Blizzcon online beyond just the trailers on YouTube
54280	59960	– those Q&A sessions are either being removed outright or tightly regulated.
59960	61340	Who knows what that means?
61340	65140	It might mean the lineup is filled with paid actors and planted questions.
65140	69480	It might mean the questions are filtered through a suggestions box, and only questions Blizzard
69480	71920	wants to answer will be read aloud.
71920	75720	It might mean the fans have to tell their question to a moderator, who then chooses
75720	77000	whether or not to ask it.
77000	79740	Here's what I'd bet money on, though.
79740	81740	Diablo Immortal was bad enough.
81740	85900	Like this Hong Kong stuff, Blizzard is not going to allow a repeat of last year.
85900	89640	And if that means they censor their own fans, so be it.
89640	92220	Your average Joe will not be allowed on the mic again.
92220	94020	But hold on a minute.
94020	95740	Give that a second thought.
95740	98100	Blizzard censoring their own fans.
98100	100460	This isn't Blizzard censoring their haters.
100460	104400	This isn't Blizzard censoring casual players of their games.
104400	107920	Blizzcon attracts only one audience, the diehard Blizzard fan.
107920	109880	The one who's grown up on Blizzard games.
109880	113400	The one who is primarily invested only in Blizzard properties.
113400	117720	The one who will play anything Blizzard makes, regardless of genre or accessibility.
117720	122120	Why is the demographic that loves Blizzard the most also simultaneously the one Blizzard's
122120	123120	the most afraid of?
123120	129000	I think the answer can be found, weirdly enough, in this unrelated article from Buzzfeed.
129000	134680	At VidCon's 10-year anniversary, influencers, fans, and brands all seem ready to leave YouTube
134680	135680	behind.
135880	139640	Unsurprisingly, it's about VidCon 2019 from this past summer.
139640	144520	And as VidCon has turned more and more social justice-oriented over time, it's switched
144520	150600	from a gaggle of interesting topics and panels and creators to a curated, SJW-approved propaganda
150600	151600	mouthpiece.
151600	153280	How dark do you want to get?
153280	157360	YouTuber Lindsay Ellis asked the moderator of one of the first panels at VidCon about
157360	160720	how online video communities have changed over the years.
160720	162520	It was fun, said Ellis.
162520	166180	And now it's like, okay, how do we protect ourselves from our audience?
166180	170320	Lindsay Ellis, despite her many attempts to get away from the name, is most well-known
170320	175020	as the Nostalgia Chick, a female counterpart to Channel Awesome's Nostalgia Critic.
175020	179280	Back when That Guy with the Glasses was relevant, the online video creation space was indeed
179280	180600	very different.
180600	182600	YouTube monetization didn't really exist.
182600	184800	Neither did copyright strikes or appeals.
184800	186560	Videos affected were usually just deleted.
186560	192760	BlipTV was bigger than YouTube and offered a flat, reliable, one-cent-per-view of a monetized
192760	193760	video.
193760	198080	However, Blip was only a video hosting service and lacked reliable channel pages, a front
198080	199360	page, or a search function.
199360	203840	In order to ensure people actually watched your Blip videos, you had to have a website
203840	206240	to embed them on that actually got a lot of traffic.
206240	210080	This is what led the larger creators of the time to simply post trailers or announcements
210080	214360	on their YouTube channels and link off-site to Blip in the video description.
214360	218800	The video ecosystem of the time was one where a popular creator could actually run their
218800	224080	own community directly, or in the case of TiguaTig, join a team of creators who cross-promote.
224080	229100	Lindsay Ellis as the Nostalgia Chick was one of the bigger names during the BlipTV era,
229100	232760	and that success did carry over to her YouTube channel after Blip's decline.
232760	236580	When she says it was fun, I think she's referring to the state of video creation during
236580	237580	her rise.
237580	242720	Yes, she had more direct control over her community, but frankly she was also younger,
242720	244760	more energetic, and a lot funnier.
244760	248600	But more telling is the line, how do we protect ourselves from our audience?
248600	251600	Well, why do you need protection from your audience?
251600	254560	Your audience loves you, presumably that's why they're your audience.
254560	257680	Why do you need protection from the people that caused your success?
257680	262320	The people that watch your videos, click your ads, donate to your Patreon, buy your merch?
262320	267000	I know that there are some creators who just get hate-watched, like Dark Side Phil, but
267000	268640	the Nostalgia Chick was never that.
268640	270520	What happened to you, Lindsay?
270520	273400	What did you do that you require protection from your own fans?
273400	277580	The Buzzfeed article goes on to talk about panels devolving into group therapy sessions,
277580	281580	as YouTubers commiserated over shared experiences with harassment and exploitation.
281580	285880	The YouTubers people care about can't be invited because they're all out of control.
285880	288760	And the safer creators they did invite are all traumatized.
288760	293680	Keemstar, the massive influencer and vlogger behind the 5 million subscriber strong YouTube
293680	297960	gossip channel Drama Alert, spent the week around Vidkong derisively tweeting about
297960	300340	how irrelevant the conference is now.
300340	302980	When Vidkong sends its YouTubers, they're not sending their best.
302980	305540	They're sending YouTubers that have lots of dead channels.
305540	307100	They're bringing in fidget spinners.
307100	308620	They're bringing in hoverboards.
308620	309620	They're randoms.
309620	311900	I know that the media likes to demonize fans.
311900	314220	They like to say their ire is irrational.
314220	317940	They're entitled, as we've seen them call gamers time and again.
317940	320700	They're dangerous, as Lindsay Ellis likes to imply.
320700	324140	I'm sure somebody inside Blizzard right now is calling them fickle.
324140	328060	Maybe on some level, at some point in time, all of these criticisms might be true.
328060	330220	You know what's way more relevant, though?
330220	336080	Anyone who's ever had their entire fanbase turn on them has been perceived by that fanbase
336080	341500	to have behaved so badly that a variation of the consumer revolt, a fandom's revolt
341500	344180	maybe, was in order.
344180	345240	Sometimes it's undeserved.
345240	347720	With ProJared, for example, it was probably not warranted.
347720	352500	But I think fans understand this when they see it, because when ProJared vindicated himself,
352500	353920	the people returned.
353920	358320	Mob rule is slow to start, hard to stop, and grossly unjust.
358320	360720	Fan rule, however, is different.
360720	363600	Fans will give the object of their fandom the benefit of the doubt.
363600	367480	They'll be more likely to forgive transgressions if the conversation is honest.
367480	369800	But also, if all of this goodwill is abused?
369800	371920	Yeah, they'll turn on you.
371920	376600	This is what Lindsay Ellis and all of those other traumatized YouTubers are noticing when
376600	378600	they talk about having to keep safe from their fans.
378600	383280	I obviously don't endorse the illegal actions of people's fans, but at some point, you
383280	387560	have to look at your own conduct and wonder how you managed to screw up having half a
387600	389320	million people who loved you.
389320	392760	I've been making videos for just as long as Lindsay, and I've never had cause to
392760	393820	fear my fans.
393820	398360	Lindsay Ellis gave a talk on this at XOXO Fest just a couple weeks ago, and holy shit,
398360	399360	is that actually her?
399360	401680	This doesn't look like a woman of 34.
401680	404840	She looks like a 49-year-old failed small-town English teacher.
404840	409600	Like, I know she's 22 in her older videos, and part of the change is just age, it happens
409600	410720	to the best of us.
410720	411720	It's happened to me.
411720	414400	But man, that's no excuse to let yourself go.
414400	416480	Anyway, listen to her talk about this.
416880	423200	Content warning, there's gonna be some Nazis, but you know, that's just the internet now.
423200	424200	It's great.
424200	425200	What a time to be alive.
425200	426200	I love it.
426200	434800	A friend of mine became the in-thor-so person sliding into my DMs like, hey, there's an
434800	436880	alt-right mob after me.
436880	438560	You know what this is like.
438560	440360	What do I do?
440360	445640	And I kind of had a moment where I'm like, wow, this keeps happening, where people ask
445640	451680	me advice on how to deal with bad faith hate mobs, that kind of had become an expert in
451680	456840	surviving that sort of thing, because it has happened to me many, many times over the years.
456840	462520	It was humiliating, because you had to have all of these people going back and forth being
462520	466240	like, hmm, this seems an awful lot like the thing that happened to Sarah Zhang at the
466240	468040	New York Times last month.
468040	472920	We had to collate all these tweets, we had to mine everything and be absolutely clear
472920	480680	on who said what and when and what the threat was, and it was very awful.
480680	487440	It harmed my relationships, it harmed my marriage, it cost me a lot of productivity and several
487440	493040	friendships, and eventually, I actually ended up at an institution, because everything was
493040	497040	just crumbling and I did not know how to deal with this.
497040	504280	Even if you're not in sort of like a literal physical war zone, is being afraid messes
504280	512360	with your brain chemistry, and then you start having the same responses that you would have
512360	517560	if you had been in sort of a physical danger, like you become jumpy, you become irritable,
517560	519000	you become more depressed.
519000	523600	These people are feeling empowered enough in their own racism that they thought, yeah,
523600	529120	they'd be like, oh, wow, yeah, anti-white racism is a thing, we should probably fire
529120	530120	this person.
530120	534680	There's good faith criticism, and that's true, but to me, it turns into bad faith when people
534680	539920	start using you as a proxy in whatever culture war thing is going on.
539920	541440	How do you deal with it?
541440	542920	I've become an expert.
542920	548480	I don't know if I've become an expert on dealing with it well, but you have to cope, or you
548480	551120	die, because nothing on the internet dies.
551120	557320	What happens is, these people, there's always going to be a subset of people who will see
557320	558320	you existing.
558320	562040	Maybe they'll see you interacting with another Twitter person, and they just kind of take
562040	566680	it upon themselves to slide into the mentions of whoever is interacting with you and being
566680	569400	like, she's an anti-white racist.
569400	572860	I'm sorry, it's funny.
572860	578880	People still are kind of like, you kind of deserve it, maybe.
578880	582140	Maybe there was something you could have done to present it, you know?
582140	588320	And it's just, people can't really help but do the victim-blaming thing.
588320	591040	It also harms your relationship with your audience.
591040	593600	You don't want to make content anymore.
593600	597780	You don't trust people, and it's hard to make content for people when you think that half
597780	599360	of them want you to die.
599360	605760	This is a conversation between Hank Green, Carlos Maza, and me.
605760	606760	Let's unpack this.
606760	610400	Do you guys know who Carlos Maza is?
610400	611400	Yes.
611400	613400	Support Carlos Maza.
613400	616200	So Carlos Maza is another YouTuber.
616200	618400	He and I were like Twitter buds.
618400	622200	We hadn't really met before the Crowdering happened.
622200	628000	But basically, he had been abused and bullied by another much bigger YouTuber named Steven
628000	630200	Crowder for years.
630200	632880	Like a lot of homophobic slurs, a lot of racist slurs.
632880	636960	And one day, Carlos decided, I'm just going to chronicle this.
636960	638960	I'm going to stand up for myself.
638960	643440	And yep, sure did.
643440	646360	So you can guess what happened after that.
646360	649040	Crowder mobilized his army and is continuing to.
649040	651860	This is still happening.
651860	655120	And then you had the exact same thinking happen with Carlos.
655120	662440	If he responds to, in this case, Hank, who is being supportive, sorry for the people
662440	669920	that are harassing me, and now they are invited into your space, and then it's, you know,
669920	672200	everybody's scattered before they see us.
672200	676920	This is the punishment for daring to interact with your colleagues in a public forum.
676920	681840	Carlos was an example where he would kind of like collate and seek out the abuse and
681840	684080	actually highlight it.
684080	690320	And I was like, no, you have to stop doing that because you're re-traumatizing yourself.
690320	695900	You're very good at actually making the trauma you already have worse because they speak
695900	697200	the language of abuse.
697200	701040	I basically have like my Twitter completely, you know, cloistered down.
701040	703660	Get into all of those advanced options, mute everything.
703660	706960	And honestly, that's been a lot healthier ever since I've done that.
706960	712200	Even since like the, you know, the nonsense of last year died down.
712200	717040	There's just such a huge volume of people at you, positive and negative.
717040	721520	And obviously, like, I, you know, it's obviously, but I get a lot of threats.
721520	726240	So we have basically like an inbox for it.
726240	728840	I have someone that handles my YouTube comments for me.
728840	731540	I don't look at them anymore.
731540	733560	And I don't really look at my Twitter mentions anymore.
733560	737120	You should not subject yourself to people abusing you.
737120	740480	You know, it becomes a form of digital self-harm.
740480	742880	And that only makes things worse.
742880	745300	There's an arrogance behind her voice here.
745300	749280	There's this idea that the internet just comes for people irrationally with no rhyme
749280	751060	or reason behind it.
751060	752580	Lindsay Ellis didn't do anything.
752580	754380	Carlos Mazza didn't do anything.
754380	758520	These poor content creators, these innocent journalists have never done a single thing
758520	760180	wrong in their entire lives.
760180	764460	And the implication is that their fame is simply a heavy burden to bear, a price to
764460	768280	pay to be in their industry because everyone who follows them sucks.
768280	773240	You can hear in her voice the extreme disdain for the people who even put her on that stage.
773240	778240	Here Lindsay, let me frame this in a way that an intersectionalist like you would understand.
778240	782480	To those who have had privilege all of their lives, criticism probably feels like oppression
782480	783880	and harassment.
783880	786320	You have the fame, the audience, you're on the stage.
786320	792080	You have the TV show, the 500,000 sub channel, you have the brand, you have the privilege.
792080	794960	Your viewers make up a class of people who don't have that privilege.
794960	799220	And if those viewers are vocal about their problems with you, I'm not surprised that
799220	803220	you felt so harassed and traumatized that you've had to give several speeches on the
803220	804220	topic now.
804220	808380	It's probably mentally scarring to have people you look down upon tell you that you're wrong.
808380	811180	Also as a side note, check out how hard she tries to avoid talking about that guy with
811180	812180	the glasses.
812180	815640	This has happened to me a lot over the years.
815640	820980	And every time, especially like as I used to work for this website that I won't name,
820980	826700	but when I worked for this website and there would be like a flood of this sort of thing,
826700	833300	the people who ran the website would either be to laugh about it, blame you for it, or
833300	834780	ignore it altogether.
834780	838500	Sorry Lindsay, but your biggest claim to fame is always going to be being Doug Walker's
838500	839500	Mrs. Pac-Man.
839500	843820	And speaking of gender swapped characters, you know how Anita Sarkeesian's huge channel
843820	847620	is largely dead now with comments and voting turned off?
847620	852260	Find anyone who was big 5-10 years ago that has since turned into a social justice nutjob
852260	854660	and you'll discover the exact same thing.
854660	855660	It's off.
855660	856660	Voting disabled.
856660	860580	Creator isolation and a lack of community engagement, constant whining in videos or
860580	865100	on social media about how the internet sucks and their viewers are all bigots.
865100	866220	No.
866220	867220	You just changed.
867220	868780	That's the long and short of it.
868780	871220	You were 18, you were 20, 22.
871220	874100	You made content with edgy jokes and witty critiques.
874100	877680	You resonated with people because you were still a member of the community.
877680	881560	But as you isolated yourself in your tower of privilege, as your old jokes and the people
881560	883940	who still like them became problematic.
883940	889400	As every new bit of content you put out began to revolve around Orange Man Bad or how everything
889400	892060	is oppressive, your fans felt betrayed.
892060	896360	And when they complained, you treated your own fanbase as your enemy, as a toxic abuser
896360	898060	you had to escape from.
898060	899580	What did you expect to happen?
899580	902060	This is what Blizzard's scrambling to repress right now.
902060	905460	Not strictly in a social justice sense like Lindsay Ellis or the others, but certainly
905460	907740	in the sense that they've betrayed their founding principles.
907740	909980	And every move they make only fuels the fire.
909980	912860	There's no honest conversation between Blizzard and the fans anymore.
912860	914260	The benefit of the doubt is gone.
914260	916620	The Goodwill's been abused one time too many.
916620	919220	And they'll probably reap what they've sown at Blizzcon.
919220	923140	Fans aren't inherently evil harassing mobs on the internet or whatever.
923140	927100	When you boil it down, fans just want creators to keep creating.
